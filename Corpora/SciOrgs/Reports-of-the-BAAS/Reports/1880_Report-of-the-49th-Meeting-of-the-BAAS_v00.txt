be offered by their Members for the advancement of Science. They are

specially requested to review the recommendations adopted at preceding
Meetings, as published in the volumes of the Association and the com-

munications made to the Sections at this Meeting, for the purposes of

selecting definite points of research to which individual or combined

exertion may be usefully directed, and branches of knowledge on the state
and progress of which Reports are wanted ; to name individuals or Com-

mittees for the execution of such Reports or researches and to state
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

sentation to the Committee of Recommendations. Unless this be done, the

--Recommendations cannot receive the sanction of the Association.
    N.B. Recommendations which may originate in any one of the Sec-

tions must first be sanctioned by the Committee of that Section before they

can be referred to the Committee of Recommendations or confirmed by

the General Committee.

     The ! Committees of the Sections shall ascertain whether a Report
has been made by every Committee appointed at the previous Meeting

to whom a sum of money has been granted, and shall report to the Com-

mittee of Recommendations in every case where no such Report has been

received.

                Notices regarding Grants of Money.

Committees and individuals, to whom grants of money have been

entrusted by the Association for the prosecution of particular researches

in science, are required to present to each following Meeting of the

Association  a  Report  of the  progress  which  has  been  made                              and  the
                                                                                           ;

Individual or the Member first named of a Committee to whom a money

grant has been made must (previously to the next Meeting of the Associa-

tion) forward to the General Secretaries or Treasurer a statement of the

sums which have been expended, and the balance which remains dispos-

able on each grant.

Grants of money sanctioned at any one Meeting of the Association

expire a week before the opening of the ensuing Meeting : nor is the

Treasurer authorized, after that date, to allow any claims on account of

such grants, unless they be renewed in the original or a modified form by

the General Committee.

No Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of

the British Association without special permission from the General Com-

mittee to do so ; and no money so raised shall be expended except in

accordance with the rules of the Association.

In each Committee, the Member first named is the only person entitled

to call on the Treasurer, Professor A. W. Williamson, University College,

London, W.C., for such portion of the sums granted as may from time to

time be required.

In grants of money to Committees, the Association does not contem-

plate the payment of personal expenses to the members.

In all cases where additional grants of money are made for the con-

tinuation of Researches at the cost of the Association, the sum named is

deemed to include, as a part of the amount, whatever balance may remain

unpaid on the former grant for the same object.

All Instruments, Papers, Drawings, and other property of the Associa-

tion are to be deposited at the Office of the Association, 22 Albemarle

Street, Piccadilly, London, W., when not employed in carrying on scien-

tific inquiries for the Association.

                                   Business of the Sections.

    The Meeting Room of each Section is opened for conversation from

10 to 11 daily. The Section Rooms and approaches thereto can be used for

no notices, exhibitions, or other purposes than those of the Association.

     At 11 precisely the Chair will be taken, and the reading of communi-
cations, in the order previously made public, commenced. At 3 p.m. the

Sections will close.

     Sections may, by the desire of the Committees, divide themselves into
Departments, as often as the number and nature of the communications

delivered in may render such divisions desirable.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  lvii

                     REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Heport of the Council for the year 1878-9, presented to the General
               Committee at Sheffield, on Wednesday, August 20, 1879.

     The Council have received Reports during the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day.

     The Council have been compelled, in consequence of the limited space

at their disposal at the office in London, to consider how far it would be
possible to reduce the number of the old Annual Volumes of the Reports

of the Association in stock, and have resolved :

   --1. ' To reduce the stock of volumes in each year to 200 in number,

          by throwing into waste or otherwise disposing of (as the General

         Officers may think best) all those exceeding 200 up to the year

          1848 inclusive, and by throwing into waste all those exceeding

     --200 in subsequent years, except the Index 1831-61.'

       2. ' To offer to one or more publishers single volumes 1831^48, at
           one-third publication price ; those 1849-71 at one-half publication
          price, for which purpose, if necessary, to reprint the volume for
           1850 ; and those 1872-77 at two-thirds publication price ; also

     --sets 1871-77 at one-third publication price.'

       3. ' To offer the Reports to members at the same rates as before,

           with the additional offer of sets 1849-71 at one-half publication

               price.'

     The Council have also had under consideration the question of their
Library, for which there is no adequate space in their present London
office. They have therefore decided to recommend that in future a
library shall not be maintained at the office of the Association, and in
order to afford facilities to the members of the Association for consulting
works of reference as fully as they have hitherto enjoyed, they have made
An arrangement with the University of London, whereby the books

belonging to the Association will be deposited in the Library of the
University at Burlington House, upon the following conditions :

     1. One copy of every book transferred by the Association to be kept

in the Library of the University.

     2. Members of the Association, on presenting an introduction from

one of the General Officers or the Assistant Secretary, to be permitted to
·consult the Library of the University.

     The Council recommend to the General Committee :

        ' That in each Section, and in each Department of a Section, one of
            the Secretaries be appointed " Recorder." '

       * That such Recorder shall be requested to furnish the Assistant
            Secretary, before the conclusion of the Meeting, with a copy or
           abstract of every Paper read in his Section or Department.'
       --

lviii      --repoet 1879.

     In order to increase the facilities for issuing the Annual Reports at
an early date the Council propose, in case the General Committee should
concur in this recommendation, that in future it shall be an instruction
to the General Officers to issue a notice to the Reporters of all Com-

mittees, and to all other persons who are likely to read Papers at any

Meeting of the Association, requesting that all Reports, and Abstracts

of all Papers intended to be read in the Sections, may be sent to the

Assistant Secretary not later than four weeks before the Meeting, in order

that, if approved of by the Organising Committees, they may be put in
type before the Meeting, and that authors who comply with this request,

and whose Papers are accepted, shall be furnished, before the Meeting,
with printed copies of their Reports or Abstracts ; also that no Report,
Paper, or Abstract be inserted in the volume unless it is in the hands of

the Assistant Secretary or Recorder, before the conclusion of the Meeting.

     The invitation from York for 1881, received last year, will be re-
newed on the present occasion, and the Council have also to announce
that an invitation from Leicester for 1882 or 1883 will be likewise pre-

sented.

     The following Resolutions were referred by the General Committee at
Dublin to the Council for consideration and action if it should seem

desirable :

    --1. 'That the question of the reappointment of the Committee, con-

          sisting of the Rev. H. F. Barnes-Lawrence, Mr. Spence Bate, Mr.

        H. E. Dresser (Secretary), Mr. J. E. Harting, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys,
         Professor Newton, the Rev. Canon Tristram, and Mr. G. Shaw

            Lefevre, for the purpose of inquiring into the possibility of estab-
            lishing a " close time," for the protection of indigenous animals, be
           referred to the Council for consideration ; and that the Council be

          empowered to take such steps in the matter as they shall think
           most desirable in the interests of science.'

     The Council decided that the Committee should be reappointed, and
that in case of any action being required before the next meeting of the
Association, the Committee should be instructed to report to the Council

thereon.

   --2. ' That the attention of the Council of the Association be called

           to the fact that the recommendations of the Royal Commission on
           Science have been altogether disregarded in the Act lately passed

         to enable the Trustees of the British Museum to remove the

           Natural History Collection to South Kensington, and that the
            Council be requested to take such steps in the matter as they shall
           think most desirable in the interests of science.'

     The Council drew up a memorial to the First Lord of the Treasury,
calling the attention of H.M. Government to this question, and requesting
Lord Beaconsfield to receive a deputation from the Council to present
the Memorial. Lord Beaconsfield having been obliged to decline to re-
ceive the deputation on account of the press of public business, the
memorial was forwarded to him at his request, and a reply has been
received, which, together with the memorial, is given in the Appendix (I.)

to this Report.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                  lix

3. ' That the question of the appointment of a Committee, con-
   sisting of Mr. James Dillon, Mr. Edward Easton, Mr. P. Le Neve
   Foster, Captain Douglas Galton, Mr. T. Hawksley, Sir John
   Hawkshaw, Professor Hull, Mr. Robert Manning, Professor Prest-

   wich, Professor Ramsay, Mr. C. E. De Ranee, the Earl of Rosse,
  Mr. W. Shelford, Mr. J. N. Shoolbred, Mr. John Smyth, jun.,

   Mr. G. J. Symons, and Mr. A. T. Atchison (Secretary), for the

   purpose of conferring with the Council as to the advisability of
   urging Government to take immediate action to procure unity of

   control of each of our principal river basins, be referred to the

   Council for consideration and action if it seem desirable.'

     The Council resolved that it did not seem to them desirable to take
any action in this matter at present.

     The Committee which was appointed last year for the purpose of
watching and reporting to the Council on Patent Legislation made a

report to the Council, which is given in Appendix II.

    A deputation of the Council and certain other members of the Asso-

ciation waited on the Attorney- General on May 27 with the Report, and
urged the passing of the Patent Law Amendment Bill, with certain

modifications. The Bill was subsequently withdrawn.
     The Council announce with great regret the loss that they have sus-

tained during the past year by the death of Mr. William Proude, P.R.S.
One vacancy having been thus caused in their body, there remain only

four names which it is necessary to remove from the list.

     The Council propose that, in accordance with the regulations, the

four retiring members shall be the following :

F. J. Bramwell, Esq., C.E., F.R.S.  W. Pengelly, Esq., F.R.S

Dr. W. Farr, F.R.S                  Professor J. Prestwich, F.R.S.

    The Council recommend the re-election of the other ordinary mem-

bers of Council, with the addition of the gentlemen whose names are

distinguished by an asterisk in the following list.

                        To the Might Hon. the First Lord of the Treasury.

  --My Lord, In accordance with a resolution adopted by the General Committee

of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at their last meeting,
the Council of the Association beg leave to call your attention to the following

circumstances.

     1. In their fourth Report, presented to Parliament in 1874, the Royal Commis-
sion on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science, having fully con-
sidered the present state of the Natural History Departments in the British
Museum, and taken evidence thereon from the principal scientific authorities of the
country, state that they have come to the conclusion ' that the objections to the
present system of government of the British Museum by a Board of Trustees as

at present constituted, so far as relates to the Natural Histoiy Collections, are well
founded, and that they have been unable to discover that the system is attended by

--any compensating advantages.' They, therefore, recommend : ' (1) That the

occasion of the removal of these collections to the new buildings now being

erected a,t South Kensington for their reception be taken advantage of to effect a
change in the governing authority and official administration of that division of the
Museum. (2) That a Director of the National Collections should be appointed by
the Crown, and should have the entire administration of the establishment, under

the control of a Minister of State, to whom he should be immediately responsible,

and that the keepers of collections should be responsible to the Director. That the
appointments of keepers and other scientific officers should be made by the
Minister, after communication with the Director and with the Board of Visitors

(hereinafter referred to). And that the Director should prepare the estimates, to be

submitted, after consultation with the Board of Visitors, for the approval of the
Minister. (3) That the present Superintendent be the first Director. (4) That a
Board of Visitors be constituted. That the Board be nominated in part by the
Crown, in part by the Royal and certain other scientific Societies of the metropolis,
and, in the first instance, in part also by the Board of Trustees ; the members to be
appointed for a limited period, but to be re-eligible ; and that the Board of Visitors
should make annual reports to the Minister, to be laid before Parliament, on the
condition, management, and requirements of the Museum, and should be empowered
to give him advice on any points affecting its administration.'

     2. Exactly the same view as to the desirability of effecting a change in the
government of the Natural History Collections was taken in a memorial presented
to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1866, and signed by the Presidents
and other well-known members of the Royal, Linnean, and Zoological Societies, a
copy of which is appended hereto.

     3. Notwithstanding these expressions of opinion, in which nearly all the leading
naturalists of the day fully concur, an Act was passed at the close of the last

session of Parliament by which the Trustees of the British Museum have been
authorised to transfer the Natural History Collections into the new building at
South Kensington without making any change whatever in the present mode of

their administration.
          REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. APPENDIX I.                        lxi

     4. The Council of the British Association feel that it is not necessary for them
to press upon the Government the arguments for the changes in the administration
of the Natural History Collections which have been so amply stated by the Com-
missioners in the Report above mentioned. The Council think it sufficient to call
the attention of the Government to the fact that the provisions of the Act are
directly at variance with the recommendations of the Royal Commissioners.

     5. As, however, a fresh application to Parliament will be necessary in order to
defray the expense of the removal of the Natural History Collections from their
present situation to South Kensington, the Council of the British Association beg

leave to point out to H.M. Government that the question of the administration of

the Natural History Collections is one of the utmost importance as regards the
future progress of Natural History in this country, and to urge upon them to take
the opportunity which will thus present itself of effecting the alterations in the

mode of administration of the Collections recommended by the Royal Com-

mission.

              We have the honour to be,

                                 Your Lordship's most obedient servants,

          The Council of the British Association foe the Advancement

                                    of Science.

          Signed, far the Council,

                                       W. SPOTTISWOODE, President.

                       To the Right Hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

   --Sir, It having been stated that the scientific men of the metropolis are, as a

body, entirely opposed to the removal of the Natural History Collections from their
?resent situation in the British Museum, we, the undersigned Fellows of the Royal,

 jinnean, Geological, and Zoological Societies of London, beg leave to offer to you
the following expression of our opinion upon the subject.

   We are of opinion that it is of fundamental importance to the progress of the

Natural Sciences in this country that the administration of the National Natural
History Collections should be separated from that of the Library and Art Collec-
tions, and placed under one Officer, who should be immediately responsible to one of
the Queeris Ministers.

   We regard the exact locality of the National Museum of Natural History as a

question of comparatively minor importance, provided that it be conveniently
accessible and within the metropolitan district.

        To the President and General Secretaries of the British Association for the

                       Advancement of Science, 22 Albemarle Street, W.

   --Gentlemen, 1 am directed by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's

Treasury to inform you that the First Lord of the Treasury has submitted to this
Board the letter of 25th March last, wherein, on behalf of the Council of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, you call his Lordship's atten-

tion to certain recommendations made in the Fourth Report of the Koyal Com-
mission on Scientific Instruction, which was presented to Parliament in 1874,
relative to the Natural History Department of the British Museum ; and wherein,
further, you refer to the British Museum Act, 1878, as ignoring the said

recommendations, and go on to urge that the occasion of proposing to Parliament
a vote towards the expense of the removal of the same collections from their
present situation to South Kensington should be taken for effecting the alterations
in the mode of administering them recommended by the Royal Commission.

    My Lords have, in the first place, to point out that the British Museum Act,

1878, nowise prejudges the question which you raise as to changes in the adminis-
tration of the collections, but is confined to authorising the removal of them to the

new Museum.

      In the next place, it is to be remembered that the recommendations to which
you advert require further legislation, and that the vote in supply, of which a part

only is necessaiy to be taken this session, for completing the new Museum is
equally required whether the collections are to remain under the management of
the Trustees of the British Museum or are to be assigned to some other authority,
and therefore that this vote, like the Act of 1878, in no degree pledged either
Parliament or Her Majesty's Government upon the question of the best way to

administer these collections in the future.

   A third point of some importance is that both the Royal Commission and the

Council which you represent propose to continue in office the present Superintendent

of the collections.

    Under these circumstances, my Lords, while fully agreeing with you that the

question of the administration of these collections is one of the utmost importance

as regards the future progress of Natural History, in this country, are also of

opinion that there is nothing which, on a point requiring so much consideration,

calls for instant decision.

     They think that the reasons which led them in 1877 to constitute the present
Meteorological Council, rather than to create a new Government department, are
not without weight in regard to displacing the Trustees of the British Museum.

     The Chairman of the Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction is himself a
member of the sub-committee of the Trustees of the British Museum for the
management of these collections. The same sub-committee contains other names

of high rank and of scientific eminence ; nor have my Lords any reason to think

that the standing committee of the Trustees, nor the Trustees generally, of the

British Museum are insensible to the importance of having modern science strongly

represented on the sub-committee of Natural History.
     The general question whether public aid to science should, in a case like the

present, not be allowed to be administered by a body with a certain real indepen-

dence of its own is a very wide and a very important one ; nor is the present the

only case which raises it.

    My Lords do not intend to propose to Parliament any immediate change in the

management of these collections, and they would be glad to find that the reasons
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. APPENDIX II.  Mii

·which had led to the recommendations of the Royal Commission had heen found to
he capable of being met without any serious departure from the principles of a
more or less independent trust.

                                                              I am, Gentlemen,
                                                                     Your obedient servant,

                                                                   R. R. W. LINGEN.

                         APPENDIX II.

                   EEPOET OF THE PATENT-LAW COMMITTEE.

--N.B. All the Scottish Members of the Committee, and several others who were

       not able to attend the meetings which took place in London, wish it to be
       noted that while concurring in all the other resolutions of the Committee, they
       do not agree in the propriety of suggesting the reduction of the term of twenty-
        one years, proposed in the Bill, to seventeen years, as the duration of a patent.

                                                                                   March 25, 1879.
     The Committee* of the British Association, appointed for watching and re-

porting to the Council on Patent_ Legislation, beg leave to report that "there are

now two Bills before Parliament in respect to Patent-law. The first Bill, brouo-ht
in by private members (Mr. Anderson, Mr. Mundella. and others), and the second,

a Government Bill, prepared and brought in by the Attorney-General, Mr. Secretary
Cross, and the Solicitor-General.

     The first Bill is very short, consisting of only five clauses. It has for its objects
the extension of the term of Patent-right, both for new patents and for those
existing at the time the Bill might become law, from fourteen years to twenty-one
years, on payment of certain sums, and a very considerable reduction in the amount
of the stamp duties payable in respect of the patent.

    As regards this Bill, the Committee have to report their opinion, that it should
not be proceeded with, looking at the comprehensive Government measure now
before the House of Commons.

     With respect to the second Bill, the Government measure, the Committee have

to report that it proposes to repeal the various Acts (seven in number) relating to
Patent Legislation, and to substitute for them this one Act of fifty-nine clauses.

    The principal novel provisions of this Bill may be summarised as follows :
    (1.) Clause 5.--In addition to the eight legal officials now acting as the Com-
missioners of Patents, all of whom, with the exception of the Master of the Rolls,

change with the Ministry, two persons recommended by the Lord Chancellor, and
three recommended by the Board of Trade, are to be appointed by her Majesty.

     (2.) Clauses 7 and 8.--The provisional protection is extended for twelve months,
but a_ complete specification must be filed, and rendered public, along with the

provisional specification, at least three months before the expiration of the provi-

sional protection.

     (3.) Clause 13.--The applicant for a patent is to have an appeal to the Lord

    * The Committee appointed by the British Association consisted of Dr. A. W.
Williamson, Professor Sir W. Thomson, Mr. Bramwell, Mr. St. John Vincent Day,
Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. C. W. Merrifield, Dr. Neilson Hancock, Professor Abel, Mr.
J. R. Napier, Captain Douglas Galton, Mr. Newmarch, Mr. E. H. Carbutt, Mr.
Macrory, and Mr. H. Trueman Wood, who, at their first meeting, passed a resolution
to add to their numbers Mr. W. H. Barlow and Mr. A. T. Atchison.

Chancellor from an adverse decision by the Law Officer. At present, the appeal is

--only by an opponent in case of a favourable opinion by the Law Officer.
     (4.) Clause 16. On payment of certain fees from time to time, the patents to

be hereafter granted are to before a term of twenty-one years, without power of

--prolongation.
     Note. This extended time is not to apply to patents existing at the date of the

only by way of correcting error, as at present, but also by way of explanation, sup-

plement, or otherwise, provided that the supplemental matter could properly have
been included within the patent had it been in the mind of the inventor at the time

the patent was taken out.

  --(6.) Clause 18. The Crown is to pay royalties in the same way as a subject
--pays them, with this qualification, however that the patentee shall be compelled

to allow the Crown to use the invention, upon terms to be agreed, or, failing

agreement, to be settled by the Treasury, with the advice and assistance of the

Commissioners of Patents.

   --(7.) Clause 19. The patent shall be revocable after three years, if the patentee

cannot show that he has put the invention into practice by himself or his licensees, or

made reasonable efforts to do so, or if he fail to grant licenses to proper persons

--requesting the same on terms which the Lord Chancellor may deem reasonable.
     (8.) Clause 47. The stamp duties on obtaining a patent are to be 121. 10s.
instead of 251. as at present ; the three years' stamp of 50/., and the seven years'

stamp of 100/., remaining as at present, with a farther payment of 100/., to be

made in the twelfth year, for the purpose of preventing the patent lapsing at the

end of the fourteenth year, and of continuing it until the twenty-one years.

    The Committee will now give the resolutions they passed upon certain details

in the Bill, and they will state the reasons which have led them to pass the
resolutions. They believed that the Bill if altered as they suggest would be a

better Bill than it is now, but they look upon the general scope of this Bill with

so much favour that they desire to refrain from any insistance of their views in

respect of detail, if such insistance would be at all likely to impede the passing
of the Bill this session, and they therefore beg leave to give here at the commence-
ment of this record of their proceedings the resolution in which they affirmed

their approval of the principle of the Government Bill.

    It was moved by Dr. C. W. Siemens, F.R.S., &c, the Chairman of the

Committee, and seconded by Mr. F. J. Bramwell, F.R.S., the Secretary of the

Committee, that

      "The Government Bill, subject to certain modifications, meets with the entire

         approval of this Committee."

     The following paragraphs give not only the views of the Committee in respect
of the modifications of those clauses which, in the judgment of the Committee,
can be beneficially altered, but also the expression of the approval of the Com-
mittee of certain new clauses in the Bill, which appear to be entirely satisfactory

--as they now stand :--
     Clause 5. The Committee observe with regret that, while providing for
extra Commissioners, no suggestion is made that these should be paid ; and,
indeed, in the " Memorandum " printed with the Bill, the new Commissioners are
described as " unpaid." If the additional Commissioners are to be of real use,

they must devote themselves continuously to the conduct of the business of the
Patent Office, and this cannot be expected without adequate payment. On this
point the Committee came to the following resolution :

   --Resolved unanimously, "That this Committee is of opinion that the five

           Commissioners to be appointed should be paid Commissioners."

  --Clauses 7, 8, and 9. The Committee consider the extension of the provisional

protection to twelve months to be desirable, but they observe that, as the patent

may be opposed at any time within the " prescribed time," and as " ' prescribed r
----

       --REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. APPENDIX II.  llV

means prescribed by general orders or general rules under this Act," there is

nothing to render it certain that the " prescribed time " may not be so extended
ss to enable opposition to be made after the complete specification is published, as

it must be at the end of nine months, at the latest, from the date of the patent.
If the " prescribed time " were thus extended, all opponents would wait until the
complete specifications were public, and then would have an opportunity of con-
ducting their opposition with the same elaboration and expense that would be
bestowed in impugning novelty by a defendant in a Patent action. The applicant
also would be put to similar cost, and thus the benefit conferred upon a poor
inventor by the reduction in the fees to be paid on obtaining a patent would be
much more than neutralised, and in lieu of the average of nine patent causes per

annum, which prevails under the present law, there would in effect be as many
causes as there were oppositions to the sealing of patents. And while considering
this subject, the very serious demand upon the time of the law officers which
would ensue upon oppositions thus conducted must not be lost sight of. On these

considerations, notwithstanding the apparent logic of the argument that at present
an opponent is opposing he knows not exactly what, while under the suggested
prescribed time he will be left in no doubt, the Committee are of opinion that, as

a matter of practical working, opposition on open documents is not expedient.
     The Committee have embodied their views on this subject in the following

resolution :

   --Kesolved unanimously, " That this Committee, fearing that if oppositions

          are conducted on open documents, the expenses of these oppositions, and
          the time occupied, will be equal to that of an action upon a patent, deem it
          desirable that the prescribed time should not extend beyond nine months
          from the date of application, and that these oppositions should be conducted
           as at present without open documents."

  --Clause 13. The Committee entirely approve of giving the applicant for a

patent the same power of appeal as is possessed by his opponent.

  --Clause 15. Clause 15 has not been referred to among the principal novel

features, because it is a repetition of the Clauses 18, 19, and 23 of the Act of
1852, but the Committee believe an alteration might be beneficially made. Under
the existing law, and under this Bill if it becomes law, an applicant for a patent
whose provisional protection bears a later date than the provisional protection of

another applicant may make earUer application for the seal, and if he does so it is
within the power of the Lord Chancellor (and the Committee know that that

power has been exercised) to date the patent of the first applicant later than that
of the second, and thus the first applicant is put to a great disadvantage. Under
these circumstances there is a temptation for applicants to obtain the seal as early
as possible, whereas it appears to the Committee that an inventor should be
encouraged, if he is in the least doubt, to use the whole of the time allowed
him before he need apply for the seal to ascertain whether his supposed invention
is new, and also whether it can be practically carried into operation, and that a
person thus prudently acting should be, as the Committee have said, encouraged,
whereas the operation of the clause would be to urge the inventor to obtain the
seal as early as possible, lest, by delaying to do so, he should lose his priority ae a

patentee.

     The Committee embodied their opinion on this point in the following reso-

lution:

   --Resolved unanimously, " That the Committee are of opinion that it is un-

           desirable there should be any doubt as to priority of patent protection,

         arising from the rapidity with which certain formal acts may be carried out
          by the applicant, and they, therefore, recommend that for all purposes, and

           under all circumstances, the priority of patents should be reckoned as from
           the day of the application for provisional protection."

--Clause 16. With respect to the proposed doing away with the power of the

1879.  d
      --

lxvi      --REPORT 1879.

Privy Council to prolong a patent after fourteen years, and to the substitution for
this of an extension of twenty-one years, as of right to all patentees, who, at the
end of twelve years, pay a further stamp duty of 100/., the Committee think it

probable that so long a term as a matter of right may be objected to, and may
imperil the Bill. It is true that the Privy Council now recommend prolongation
to the extent, in some cases, of as much as seven years (indeed longer extensions

have been recommended), but they only do so on strict proof (however useful the

invention may be) that the patentee has not been sufficiently remunerated, while

the twenty-one years as of right, proposed by the Bill, would obviously be accepted
by every prosperous patentee, and thus a more than sufficient payment might be
made by the public for the disclosure and bringing into operation of the invention.
Influenced by these considerations, the Committee are inclined to suggest that the
seventeen years' duration of patents in the United States might well be adopted
here. If the Bill were thus modified, it would become necessary to alter the times
of payment of the various stamp duties, and as the Committee are of opinion that
three years from the date of the patent (which is but two years from the cessa-

tion of the provisional protection) is so short a time as in many instances not to
suffice for such development of the patent as to enable the patentee to come to a

right decision on the question whether he will allow his patent to lapse or to pay
the stamp duty of 501., they recommend that the time for this first payment should
be four years from the date of the patent.

     The following is the resolution in which the Committee have embodied their

opinion on this subject :

    --Resolved unanimously, " That this Committee would have thought an ex-

           tension from fourteen to seventeen years sufficient compensation for the loss
           of the power to apply for a prolongation, but whether the seventeen or
           twenty-one years be adopted as the term of the patent, the Committee are
           of opinion that the times of cesser and the dates of payment to carry on

           the patent for a certain term should be at the end of four, eight, and

           fourteen years from the date of the patent."

   --Clause 17. The liberty to amend, by way of supplement, is, in the judgment
--of the Committee, a most important improvement.

      Clause 18. The Committee hold the same opinion with respect to the pro-
vision that the Crown shall pay royalties for the use of a patent. They would be

glad if some better machinery could be devised for settling (failing agreement)

--what the royalty should be, but they have no suggestion to make on the subject.
      Clause 19. This clause, it will be seen, makes a patent voidable after three

years on either of two grounds, failure to use or to properly endeavour to do so,

 proof of which shall be on the patentee ; and refusing to grant licenses to proper

 persons, on terms to be imposed by the Chancellor.

      It appears to the Committee that if the second of these conditions be enacted, the

 first is unnecessary, as it is clear that a patent cannot be regarded as an obstruction

to manufacture, when any responsible manufacturer wishing to use it can do so by
 paying a reasonable royalty, and the Committee believe that the first condition

 might readily be abused, for instance, in those cases where an invention relates to

 subjects which from their nature cannot be, with certain classes of inventors, put

into operation by the patentees themselves, such as where a scientific man uncon-
 nected with trade or commerce has made an improvement in blast furnaces or in
 steam navigation. In these cases the inventor is at the mercy of those who own
 blast furnaces, or who own ocean steamers, and it is quite conceivable that such

 persons might band themselves together to prevent the use of the patent during
 the first three years of its existence. Bearing this danger in mind of the abuse of

 the first condition, and looking at the fact that the existence of a patent subject to

 compulsory licenses would not be an impediment to the manufacture, the Com-

 mittee desire to see the first condition expunged, and, as regards the second
 condition, they trust that the words which were in the Government Bill of 1877,

 may be inserted, and that thereby the proof of the need of licenses may be imposed,

 as in their judgment it should be upon the person seeking them.
      ----

      REPORT OF THE COUNCIL. APPENDIX II.  lxvil

The following is the resolution in which the Committee have emhodied their

opinion upon this point :

   --Resolved unanimously, "That Sub-Section a should be struck out, and

that Clause 19 should be altered accordingly, so as to read thus : ' The

patent shall be liable at any time at the end of three years from its date to
--be revoked on the following ground
      ': And that the words

which appear in Clause 22, Sub-Section 2, of the Bill of 1877 should be

inserted on this Bill, viz., ' that it is made to appear to the Lord Chancellor

that

  --Clause 24. The Committee now desire to call attention to Section 24 of the

Bill headed " Imported Inventions." With one exception, namely, Clause b of

Sub-Section 5, which restricts the time within which an imported invention can

be patented in England to six months after the date of the earliest foreign patent,
a restriction which appears to the Committee to be veiy undesirable, this section

is practically the same as that of Section 25 of the Patent Law Amendment Act,

1852, and thus it is that the Committee have omitted all mention of it in the sum-
mary of principal changes given at the outset of this report. The Committee,
however, feel so strongly that the Section 25 of the Act of 1852 was based upon
the old erroneous notion of the object of a Patent-law, and is a relic of an anti-

-- --quated state of things now entirely uncalled for and mischievous that they trust

Clause 24, which practically re-enacts Clause 25 of the Act of 1852, may be ex-
punged altogether from the Bill. The Committee desire to be allowed to explain
their views on this subject. The old notion of a Patent-law was that the inventor

was a person seeking to obtain a protection for himself at the expense of the public,
who, it was assumed, should regard the inventor as an antagonist, and should do
all they could to procure a disclosure of the invention upon the shortest possible
term of payment by patent right ; or, better still, by no such payment at all. It
is to be feared that these erroneous notions still prevail amongst those who have
not studied the subject, but those who have studied it know that a Patent-law can
only be desirable so long as it is for the benefit of the community as a whole.
Those also who are acquainted with the introducing of inventions know that

nothing short of a person having a strong interest in developing the invention will

cause it to be taken up, the more important the invention is the greater being the

indisposition to adopt it, since its introduction may involve the disuse of existing

plant and machinery, the expenditure of fresh capital upon plant, and the teaching

of workmen to follow new processes. One who knows the subject from its very

foundation has truly said, that if an invention ' were found lying in the street it

would be for the benefit of the community that a father should be assigned to it,

so that there might be some one having a substantial interest in urging its

development.'

     Clause 24 of the present Bill (25 of the Act of 1852) is based altogetheron
the assumption that it is to the interest of the community to be in possession

of what the Committee may perhaps be pardoned for styling 'orphan inven-

tions.'

     Further, with respect to section 24 (25 of 1852) being a relic of an antiquated

--state of things when the means of communication between countries were limited,

and international travellers were rare, when the technical literature of one country
did not circulate in other lands where a different language was spoken, it might be

that if an inventor did not patent his invention in a foreign country the foreigners
would remain ignorant of it, while if he did so patent it, he would afford the
information to the foreigners, and that so, if after a time his foreign patent came to

an end, the foreigners would be in a better position than any British subject if a
patent for the invention continued to prevail here. But under the existing condi-

tion of extended travelling, and of the interchange of technical literature, the idea

that the foreigner will only know of an invention from its having been patented
in his country is manifestly untenable, and thus there is no reason why a man who

has taken out patents in foreign countries for an invention should be on a different
footing, as regards the English patent, from that on which he would have been had

                                                             d2
        ----

lxviii        --eepobt 1879.

he refrained from taking out those patents. Many cases of great hardship have-
heen inflicted by virtue of this Section 25 of the Act of 1852, and harm to the
public has resulted therefrom. The Committee trust that the framers of the
present Bill, who are obviously desirous of introducing a measure conceived in the
interest of the community at large, will not hesitate to get rid of this Section 24.
The Committee have embodied their views on this subject in the following re-

solution :

   --Kesolved unanimously, " That the Committee advise that Clause 24 should

           be struck out, as they are of opinion that it would be desirable to deal with
           foreign inventions upon the same terms as English inventions ; and they are
           further of opinion that the duration of an- English patent should not be
           affected by the determination of any foreign patent."

     Another detail in the Bill to which the Committee desire to call attention, is

a provision in Clause 46 by which one Commissioner may be empowered to act for

the whole body. This appears to the Committee to be very inexpedient, and they
would be glad to see this clause altered to the form which it has as Clause 55 in
the Government Bill of 1877. The resolution of the Committee on this point was

as follows :

    --Resolved unanimously " That the Committee are of opinion that paragraph

           46 ought to be left the same as 55 of the Bill of 1877."

   --Clause 47. With regard to the proposed reduction of the first cost of the

patent from 25/. to 12/. 10s., the Committee entirely concur with it, and they be-
lieve that the payment of 50/. at the expiration, not of three years, but as has
already been mentioned, of four years, is a useful provision for getting rid of value-
less patents. The other payments they also concur in, but with the modification in
point of date which has been already mentioned.

      Finally, the Committee respectfully suggest to the Council of the British Asso-
ciation that they should appoint a deputation from the Council, with such other

members of the Association as the Council may select, to wait upon the Govern-
ment to urge the passing of the Bill this session, with such amendments in detail
as, on consideration of the report of your Committee, the ' preparers ' may see fit

to adopt.

It is no easy thing to find material suited to an occasion like the present.

For on the one hand there is risk that a presidential address may be too

special for an audience necessarily large and general, while on the other

hand it may treat too much of generalities to take hold of the sympathies

and command the attention of the hearers.

It may be supposed that my subject should have been suggested by

the great manufacturing industries of the town which has brought us to-

gether                                 but I felt convinced that a worker  in only the biological  sciences
                                    ;

could not do justice to the workers in so very different a field.

    I am not therefore going to discourse to you of any of those great

--industries which make civilised society what it is, of those practical

applications of scientific truth which within the last half-century have

become developed with such marvellous rapidity, and which have already

become interwoven with our everyday life, as the warp of the weaver is

interwoven with the woof. Such subjects must be left to other occupiers

of this chair, from whom they may receive that justice which I could not

pretend to give them ; and I believe I shall act most wisely by keeping to

a field with which my own studies have been more directly connected.

I know that there are many here present from whom I have no right

to expect that previous knowledge which would justify me in dispensing

with such an amount of elementary treatment as can alone bring my
subject intelligibly before them, and my fellow-members of the British

Association who have the advantage of being no novices in that depart-

ment of biology with which I propose to occupy you, will pardon me if I

address myself mainly to those for whom the field of research on which

we are about to enter has now been opened for the first time.

I have chosen, then, as the matter of my address to you to-night, a

subject in whose study there has during the last few years prevailed an

unwonted amount of activity, resulting in the discovery of many remark-

able facts, and the justification of many significant generalisations. I

propose, in short, to give you in as untechnical a form as possible some
account of the most generalised expression of living matter, and of the
results of the more recent researches into its nature and phenomena.

     More than forty years have now passed away since the French natu-

ralist Dujardin drew attention to the fact that the bodies of some of the
lowest members of the animal kingdom consist of a structureless, semi-

Afluid, contractile substance, to which he gave the name of Sarcode.

similar substance occurring in the cells of plants was afterwards studied

by Hugo von Mohl, and named by him Protoplasm. It remained for
Max Schultze to demonstrate that the sarcode of animals and the proto-

plasm of plants were identical.

     The conclusions of Max Schultze have been in all respects confirmed

by subsequent research, and it has further been rendered certain that this
same protoplasm lies at the base of all the phenomena of life, whether in
the animal or the vegetable kingdom. Thus has arisen the most important
and significant generalisation in the whole domain of biological science.

     Within the last few years protoplasm has again been made a subject
of special study, unexpected and often startling facts have been brought
to light, and a voluminous literature has gathered round this new centre
of research. I believe, therefore, that I cannot do better than call your
attention to some of the more important results of these inquiries, and
endeavour to give you some knowledge of the properties of protoplasm,
and of the part it plays in the two great kingdoms of organic nature.

     As has just been said, protoplasm lies at the base of every vital pheno-
menon. It is, as Huxley has well expressed it, ' the physical basis of life.'
Wherever there is life, from its lowest to its highest manifestations, there
is protoplasm ; wherever there is protoplasm, there too is life. Thus co-

--extensive with the whole of organic nature every vital act being referable
--to some mode or property of protoplasm it becomes to the biologist what

the ether is to the physicist ; only that instead of being a hypothetical
 conception, accepted as a reality from its adequacy in the explanation of

phenomena, it is a tangible and visible reality, which the chemist may

 analyse in his laboratory, the biologist scrutinise beneath his microscope
and his dissecting needle.

      The chemical composition of protoplasm is very complex, and has not
 been exactly determined. It may, however, be stated that protoplasm is
 essentially a combination of albuminoid bodies, and that its principal
elements are, therefore, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. In its

--typical state it presents the condition of a semi-fluid substance a tena-

 cious, glairy liquid, with a consistence somewhat like that of the white-
 of an unboiled egg. 1 While we watch it beneath the microscope move-

      1 In speaking of protoplasm as a liquid, it must be borne in mind that this

--expression refers only to its physical consistence a condition depending mainly

 on the amount of water with which it is combined, and subject to considerable
ADDRESS.                                                                               3

 ments are set up in it ; waves traverse its surface, or it may be seen to
 flow away in streams, either broad and attaining but a slight distance
 from the main mass, or else stretching away far from their source, as
 narrow liquid threads, which may continue simple, or may divide into
 branches, each following its own independent course ; or the streams may

 flow one into the other, as streamlets would flow into rivulets and rivulets
 into rivers, and this not only where gravity would carry them, but in a

 direction diametrically opposed to gravitation ; now we see it spreading

 itself out on all sides into a thin liquid stratum, and again drawing itself
 together within the narrow limits which had at first confined it, and
 all this without any obvious impulse from without which would send the

 ripples over its surface or set the streams flowing from its margin.

 Though it is certain that all these phenomena are in response to some
 stimulus exerted on it by the outer world, they are such as we never

--meet with in a simply physical fluid they are spontaneous movements

 resulting from its proper irritability, from its essential constitution as

 living matter.

     Examine it closer, bring to bear on it the highest powers of your

--microscope you will probably find disseminated through it countless

multitudes of exceedingly minute granules ; but you may also find it

absolutely homogeneous, and, whether containing granules or not, it is
certain that you will find nothing to which the term organisation can be

applied. You have before you a glairy, tenacious fluid, which, if not abso-

lutely homogeneous, is yet totally destitute of structure.

     And yet no one who contemplates this spontaneously moving matter

can deny that it is alive. Liquid as it is, it is a living liquid ; organless
and structureless as it is, it manifests the essential phenomena of life.

     The picture which I have thus endeavoured to trace for you in a few
leading outlines is that of protoplasm in its most generalised aspect.
Such generalisations, however, are in themselves unable to satisfy the
conditions demanded by an exact scientific inquiry, and I propose now,
before passing to the further consideration of the place and purport of

protoplasm in nature, to bring before you some definite examples of proto-
plasm, such as are actually met with in the organic world.

   A quantity of a peculiar slimy matter was dredged in the North

Atlantic by the naturalists of the exploring ship ' Porcupine ' from a depth
of from 5,000 to 25,000 feet. It is described as exhibiting, when examined
on the spot, spontaneous movements, and as being obviously endowed
with life. Specimens of this, preserved in spirits, were examined by Prof.
Huxley, and declared by him to consist of protoplasm, vast masses of
which must thus in a living state extend over wide areas of sea bottom.
To this wonderful slime Huxley gave the name of Bathybius Haeckelii.

variation, from the solid form in which we find it in the dormant embryo of seeds, to
the thin watery state in which it occurs in the leaves of Valisneria. Its distin-
guishing properties are totally different from those of a purely physical liquid, and

are subject to an entirely different set of laws.

                                                   b2
--4 BEPORT 1879.

Bathybius has since been subjected to an exhaustive examination by

Prof. Haeckel, who believes that he is able to confirm in all points the

conclusions of Huxley, and arrives at the conviction that the bottom of the

open ocean, at depths below 5,000 feet, is covered with an enormous mass

of living protoplasm, which lingers there in the simplest and most primi-

tive condition, having as yet acquired no definite form. He suggests that

it may have originated by spontaneous generation, but leaves this question

for future investigators to decide.

The reality of Bathybius, however, has not been universally accepted.

In the more recent investigations of the ' Challenger ' the explorers have

failed in their attempts to bring further evidence of the existence of

masses of amorphous protoplasm spreading over the bed of the ocean.

They have met with no trace of Bathybius in any of the regions explored

by them, and they believe that they are justified in the conclusion that

the matter found in the dredgings of the ' Porcupine ' and preserved in

spirits for further examination was only an inorganic precipitate due to

the action of the alcohol.

It is not easy to believe, however, that the very elaborate investigations

of Huxley and Haeckel can be thus disposed of. These, moreover, have

received strong confirmation from the still more recent observations of

the Arctic voyager, Bessels, who was one of the explorers of the ill-fated

' Polaris,' and who states that he dredged from the Greenland seas

masses of living undifferentiated protoplasm. Bessels assigns to these

the name of Protobathybius, but they are apparently indistinguishable

from the Bathybius of the ' Porcupine.' Further arguments against the

reality of Bathybius will therefore be needed before a doctrine founded

on observations so carefully conducted shall be relegated to the region

of confuted hypotheses.

    Assuming, then, that Bathybius, however much its supposed wide
distribution may have been limited by more recent researches, has a real

existence, it presents us with a condition of living matter the most

rudimental it is possible to conceive. No law of morphology has as yet

exerted itself in this formless slime. Even the simplest individualisation

Weis absent.     have a living mass, but we know not where to draw its

boundary lines ; it is living matter, but we can scarcely call it a living

being.

"We are not, however, confined to Bathybius for examples of proto-

plasm in a condition of extreme simplicity. Haeckel has found, inhabiting

the fresh waters in the neighbourhood of Jena, minute lumps of proto-
plasm, which when placed under the microscope were seen to have no

constant shape, their outline being in a state of perpetual change, caused

by the protrusion from various parts of their surface of broad lobes and

thick finger-like projections, which, after remaining visible for a time,

would be withdrawn, to make their appearance again on some other part

of the surface.

These changeable protrusions of its substance, without fixed position

or definite form, are eminently characteristic of protoplasm in some of
its simplest conditions. They have been termed ' Pseudopodia,' and will
frequently come before you in what I have yet to say.

     To the little protoplasmic lumps thus constituted, Haeckel has given
the name of Protamoeba primitiva. They may be compared to minute

detached pieces of Bathybius. He has seen them multiplying themselves

by spontaneous division into two pieces, which, on becoming independent,
increase in size and acquire all the characters of the parent.

     Several other beings as simple as Protamoeba have been described by
various observers, and especially by Haeckel, who brings the whole
together into a group to which he gives the name of Monera, suggested by
the extreme simplicity of the beings included in it.

    But we must now pass to a stage a little higher in the development

of protoplasmic beings. Widely distributed in the fresh and salt waters of
Britain, and probably of almost all parts of the world, are small particles
of protoplasm closely resembling the Protamoeba just described. Like it,
they have no definite shape, and are perpetually changing their form, throw-
ing out and drawing in thick lobes and finger-like pseudopodia, in which
their body seems to flow away over the field of the microscope. They
are no longer, however, the homogeneous particle of protoplasm which
forms the body of Protamoeba. Towards the centre a small globular mass
of firmer protoplasm has become differentiated off from the remainder, and
forms what is known as a nucleus, while the protoplasm forming the extreme
outer boundary differs slightly from the rest, being more transparent,
destitute of granules, and apparently somewhat firmer than the interior.

We may also notice that at one spot a clear spherical space has made its

appearance, but that while we watch it has suddenly contracted and
vanished, and after a few seconds has begun to dilate so as again to come
into view, once more to disappear, then again to return, and all this in

regular rhythmical sequence. This little rhythmically pulsating cavity is

called the ' contractile vacuole.' It is of very frequent occurrence among
those beings which lie low down in the scale of life.

    We have now before us a being which has arrested the attention of

naturalists almost from the commencement of microscopical observation.
It is the famous Amoeba, for which ponds and pools and gutters on the
house-roof have for the last 200 years been ransacked by the micro-
scopist, who has many a time stood in amazement at the undefinable form
and Protean changes of this particle of living matter. It is only the
science of our own days, however, which has revealed its biological im-
portance, and shown that in this little soft nucleated particle we have
a body whose significance for the morphology and physiology of living
beings cannot be overestimated, for in Amoeba we have the essential

characters of a cell, the morphological unit of organisation, the physio-

logical source of specialised function.

     The term ' cell ' has been so long in use that it cannot now be displaced
from our terminology ; and yet it tends to convey an incorrect notion,
--6 REPORT 1879.

suggesting, as it does, the idea of a hollow body or vesicle, this having
been the form under which it was first studied. The cell, however, is
essentially a definite mass of protoplasm having a nucleus imbedded in it.

It may, or may not, assume the form of a vesicle ; it may, or may not,
be protected by an enveloping membrane ; it may, or may not, contain
a contractile vacuole ; and the nucleus may, or may not, contain within

it one or more minute secondary nuclei or 'nucleoli.'
     Haeckel has done good service to biology in insisting on the necessity

of distinguishing such non-nucleated forms as are presented by Protamoeba
and the other Monera from the nucleated forms as seen in Amoeba. To
the latter he would restrict the word cell, while he would assign that

of ' cytode ' to the former. 2

    2 In every typical cell three parts may be distinguished. There is first the more

or less liquid granular protoplasm ; secondly the nucleus ; and thirdly an external

--more firm zone of protoplasm, known as the ' cortical layer ' the Hautschicht of the

German histologists. All these parts may be regarded as portions differentiated

out of the original simple protoplasm. Cells do not, however, always remain on a
stage of such simplicity as that presented by Ainceba. The nucleus is always at its

origin quite homogeneous, but as it increases in size it usually manifests a differen-
tiation resulting in a constitution which recent research has shown to be more

complex than had been previously supposed ; for we often find it to present

an external firmer layer, or nuclear membrane, including within it the softer nuclear

protoplasm, in which again a network of filaments has been in many instances

described.

     The structure of the nucleus has been quite recently studied by Flemming (Arch,
f. Mikr. Anat. Band xvi. Heft 2. 1878), who has given particular attention to this
intranuclear network. He maintains that in its completed state the nucleus consists

of a parietal firm layer, which encloses, besides specially differentiated nucleoli, a

framework (Geriist) of filaments with a more fluid intervening substance. He

further insists on the fact that, with the differentiation of a nucleus, there is intro-
duced a chemical difference between its substance and that of the surrounding

cell-substance, as shown not only by a different behaviour of the nucleus towards

re-agents, but by an actually determined difference of chemical composition.

Klein (Quarterly Joiirn. Mier. Sei. vol. xviii. p. 316) has shown that in the cells

of the stomach of Triton cristatus there is a delicate intranuclear network of fila-

ments  in  all  respects  resembling  that  described                                  by  Flemming                                                    and  he  further
                                                                                                                                                    ;

maintains that the network of the nucleus is here continuous, through minute

apertures near the poles of the nuclear membrane, with a similar network in the

surrounding cell-substance. In this cell-substance he distinguishes two parts--the

homogeneous ground -substance and the intracellular network of filaments.
     Flemming, however, will not admit this connection between intra-nuclear and

intra-cellular filaments, and Schleicher, as the result of his very recent researches on
the division of cartilage-cells (Die Enwjielzelltheihmg, Arch, f . Mikr. Anat. Band

xvi. Heft 2, 1878), concludes that in these there is no true intra-cellular network,
the nucleus being here composed of a multitude of separate rodlets, filaments, and

granules surrounded by the nuclear membrane.

The minute granules which are generally seen in the soft protoplasm of the cell

do not seem to be essential constituents. They are probably nutritive matter intro-

duced from without, and in process of assimilation and conversion into proper

protoplasm. Hanstein has distinguished by the term Metaplasm these granules

from the proper homogeneous protoplasm in which they are suspended. The

external  cortical layer is quite  destitute of  them                                  on  this  devolves                                              the  property of
                                                                                    :

protecting the contents from the unfavourable action of outer influences, and to it

alone in plants is allocated the property of secreting the cellulose boundary wall.
     Several recent observers, but more especially Strasburger (Studien iiber das

Protoplasnia Jenaisehe Zeitschr. 1876), have described in the cortical layer of
various cells a radial striation, as if formed by excessively delicate rodlets (Stab-

chen), placed vertically to the surface and in close proximity to one another. He

Let us observe our Amoeba a little closer. Lite all living beings, it

must be nourished. It cannot grow as a crystal would grow by accumu-

lating on its surface molecule after molecule of matter. It must feed. It

must take into its substance the necessary nutriment ; it must assimilate

this nutriment, and convert it into the material of which it is itself

composed.

If we seek, however, for a mouth by which the nutriment can

enter into its body, or a stomach by which this nutriment can be digested,

we seek in vain. Yet watch it for a moment as it lies in a drop of water

beneath our microscope. Some living denizen of the same drop is in its

neighbourhood, and its presence exerts on the protoplasm of the Amoeba

a special stimulus which gives rise to the movements necessary for the

Aprehension of nutriment.  stream of protoplasm instantly runs away

from the body of the Amoeba towards the destined prey, envelopes it in

its current, and then flows back with it to the central protoplasm, where

it sinks deeper and deeper into the soft yielding mass, and becomes

dissolved, digested, and assimilated in order that it may increase the size

and restore the energy of its captor.

But again, like all living things, Amoeba must multiply itself, and so

after attaining a certain size its nucleus divides into two halves, and then

the surrounding protoplasm becomes similarly cleft, each half retaining

one half of the original nucleus. The two new nucleated masses which

thus arise now lead an independent life, assimilate nutriment, and attain

the size and characters of the parent.

    "We have just seen that in the body of an Amoeba we have the type of

a cell. Now both the fresh waters and the sea contain many living beings

besides Amoeba which never pass beyond the condition of a simple cell.

Many of these, instead of emitting the broad lobe-like pseudopodia of

Amoeba, have the faculty of sending out long thin threads of protoplasm,

which they can again retract, and by the aid of which they capture their

prey or move from place to place. Simple structureless protoplasm as

they are, many of them fashion for themselves an outer membranous or

calcareous case, often of symmetrical form and elaborate ornamentation,

or construct a silicious skeleton of radiating spicula, or crystal clear

concentric spheres of exquisite symmetry and beauty.

Some move about by the aid of a flagellum, or long whip-like pro-

jection of their bodies, by which they lash the surrounding waters, and

which, unlike the pseudopodia of Amoeba, cannot, during active life, be

withdrawn into the general protoplasm of the body ; while among many

has seen a relation between these and the cilia on the swarm spores of Vaucheria,
where each cilium seems to be supported by a rodlet. That this condition of the

cortical layer, however, is not a general feature of cell protoplasm, is certain ; it
is but a special case of structural differentiation. Indeed, the complex structure
which has been detected in the nucleus and in the surrounding cell-protoplasm
can scarcely be otherwise regarded than as an expression of an early differentiation
in the structure of the cell, and not, as has been maintained, an ultimate or

' plastidular ' condition of protoplasm.
--8 REPORT 1879.

--others locomotion is effected by means of cilia microscopic vibratible*

hairs, which are distributed in various ways over the surface, and which,,
like the pseudopodia and flagella, are simple prolongations of their pro-

toplasm.

     In every one of these cases the entire body has the morphological
value of a cell, and in this simple cell reside the whole of the properties
which manifest themselves in the vital phenomena of the organism.

     The part fulfilled by these simple unicellular beings in the economy
of nature has at all times been very great, and many geological forma-
tions, largely built up of their calcareous or silicious skeletons, bear
testimony to the multitudes in which they must have swarmed in the

waters of the ancient earth.

     Those which have thus come down to us from ancient times owe their
preservation to the presence of the hard persistent structures secreted by

their protoplasm, and must, after all, have formed but a very small propor-
tion of the unicellular organisms which peopled the ancient world, and
there fulfilled the duties allotted to them in nature, but whose soft, perish-
able bodies have left no trace behind.

    In our own days similar unicellular organisms are at work, taking
their part silently and unobtrusively in the great scheme of creation, and
mostly destined, like their predecessors, to leave behind them no record
of their existence. The Red Snow Plant, to which is mainly due the
beautiful phenomenon by which tracts of Arctic and Alpine snow become

tinged of a delicate crimson, is a microscopic organism whose whole body
consists of a simple spherical cell. In the protoplasm of this little cell
must reside all the essential attributes of life ; it must grow by the
reception of nutriment ; it must repeat by multiplication that form
which it has itself inherited from its parent ; it must be able to respond
to the stimulus of the physical conditions by which it is surrounded.

And there it is, with its structure almost on the bounds of extremest

simplification, taking its allotted part in the economy of nature, com-
bining into living matter the lifeless elements which lie around it,,
redeeming from sterility the regions of never-thawing ice, and peopling
with its countless millions the wastes of the snow land. 3

     But organisation does not long rest on this low stage of unicellular
simplicity, for as we pass from these lowest forms into higher, we find
cell added to cell, until many millions of such units become associated
in a single organism, where each cell, or each group of cells, has its
own special work, while all combine for the welfare and unity of the

whole.

     In the most complex animals, however, even in man himself, the com-

ponent cells, notwithstanding their frequent modification and the usual

the agency of chlorophyll, like the ordinary green plants. As in these, chlorophyll
is developed in it, and is only withdrawn from view by the predominant red pig-
 ment to which the Protocoecus owes one of its most striking characteristics.

intimacy of their union, are far from losing their individuality. Examine-

under the microscope a drop of blood freshly taken from the human

subject, or from any of the higher animals. It is seen to be composed of
a multitude of red corpuscles, swimming in a nearly colourless liquid, and

along with these, but in much smaller numbers, somewhat larger colour-
less corpuscles. The red corpuscles are modified cells, while the colour-

less corpuscles are cells still retaining their typical form and properties.
These last are little masses of protoplasm, each enveloping a central

nucleus. Watch them. They will be seen to change their shape ; they

will project and withdraw pseudopodia, and creep about like an Amoeba.
But, more than this, like an Amoeba, they will take in solid matter as

nutriment. They may be fed with coloured food, which will then be

seen to have accumulated in the interior of their soft transparent proto-
plasm ; and in some cases the colourless blood-corpuscles have actually
been seen to devour their more diminutive companions, the red ones.

     Again, there are certain cells filled with peculiar coloured matters, and
called pigment-cells, which are especially abundant, as constituents of

the skin in fishes, frogs, and other low vertebrate, as well as many inver-
tebrate animals. Under certain stimuli, such as that of light, or of

emotion, these pigment cells change their form, protrude or retract
pseudopodial prolongations of their protoplasm, and assume the form of
stars or of irregularly lobed figures, or again draw themselves together
into little globular masses. To this change of form in the pigment-cell
the rapid change of colour so frequently noticed in the animals provided
with them is to be attributed.

     The animal egg, which in its young state forms an element in the
structure of the parent organism, possesses in the relations now under
consideration a peculiar interest. The egg is a true cell, consisting essen-
tially of a lump of protoplasm enclosing a nucleus, and having a nucleolus
included in the interior of the nucleus. While still very young it has no
constant form, and is perpetually changing its shape. Indeed, it is often
impossible to distinguish it from an Amoeba ; and it may, like an Amoeba,
wander from place to place by the aid of its pseudopodial projections.
I have shown elsewhere 4 that the primitive egg of the remarkable hy-
droid Myriothela manifests amoeboid motions ; while Haeckel has shown 5
that in the sponges certain amoeba-like organisms, which are seen
wandering about in the various canals and cavities of their bodies, and
had been until lately regarded as parasites which had gained access from
without, are really the eggs of the sponge ; and a similar amoeboid con-
dition is presented by the very young eggs of even the highest animals.

     Again, Reichenbach has proved 6 that during the development of the

crayfish the cells of the embryo throw out pseudopodia by which, exactly
as in an Amceba, the yolk- spheres which serve as nutriment for the
embryo are surrounded and engulphed in the protoplasm of the cells.

     I had shown some years ago 7 that in Myriothela pseudopodial pro-
cesses are being constantly projected from the walls of the alimentary
canal into its cavity. They appear as direct extensions of a layer of
clear, soft homogeneous protoplasm which lies over the surface of the
naked cells lining the cavity, and which I now regard as the ' Haut-

schicht ' or cortical layer of these cells. I then suggested that the func-

tion of these pseudopodia lay in seizing, in the manner of an amceba,

such alimentary matter as may be found in the contents of the canal,

and applying it to the nutrition of the hydroid.

    What I had thus suggested with regard to Myriothela has been
since proved in certain planarian worms by Metschnikoff, 8 who has seen

the cells which line the alimentary canal in these animals act like inde-
pendent Amoeba?, and engulph in their protoplasm such solid nutriment

as may be contained in the canal. When the Planaria was fed with

colouring matter these amoeboid cells became gorged with the coloured
particles just as would have happened in an amceba when similax*ly fed.

     But it is not alone in such loosely aggregated cells as those of the

blood, or in the amoeboid cells of the alimentary canal, or in such scat-
tered constituents of the tissues as the pigment cells, or in cells des-
tined for an ultimate state of freedom, as the egg, that there exists an
independence. The whole complex organism is a society of cells, in
which every individual cell possesses an independence, an autonomy, not

at once so obvious as in the blood-cells, but not the less real. With
this autonomy of each element there is at the same time a subordination

of each to the whole, thus establishing a unity in the entire organism,

and a concert and harmony between all the phenomena of its life.
     In this society of cells each has its own work to perform, and the life

of the organism is made up of the lives of its component cells. Here it
is that we find most distinctly expressed the great law of the physiolo-
 gical division of labour. In the lowest organisms, where the whole being
consists of a single cell, the performance of all the processes which con-
stitute its life must devolve on the protoplasm of this one cell ; but as
we pass to more highly organised beings, the work becomes distributed
among a multitude of workers. These workers are the cells which now
make up the complex organism. The distribution of labour, however, is
 not a uniform one, and we are not to suppose that the work performed
 by each cell is but a repetition of that of every other. For the life pro-

 cesses, which are accumulated in the single cell of the unicellular or-
 ganism become in the more complex organism differentiated, some being
 intensified and otherwise modified and allocated to special cells, or to

special groups of cells, which we call organs, and whose proper duty is
now to take charge of the special processes which have been assigned to

--them. In all this we have a true division of labour, a division of

labour, however, by no means absolute ; for the processes which are

essential to the life of the cell must still continue common to all the cells
of the organism. No cell, however great may be the differentiation of

function in the organism, can dispense with its irritability, the one con-
stant and essential property of every living cell. There thus devolves on

each cell or group of cells some special work which contributes to the
well-being of all, and their combined labours secure the necessary con-
ditions of life for every cell in the community, and result in those com-
plex and wonderful phenomena which constitute the life of the higher

organisms.

   We have hitherto considered the cell only as a mass of active

nucleated protoplasm, either absolutely naked, or partially enclosed in a
protective case, which still permits free contact of the protoplasm with

the surrounding medium. In very many instances, however, the proto-

plasm becomes confined within resisting walls, which entirely shut it in

from all direct contact with the medium which surrounds it. With the
plant this is almost always so after the earliest stages of its life. Here
the protoplasm of the cells is endowed with the faculty of secreting over

its surface a firm, resisting membrane, composed of cellulose, a substance
destitute of nitrogen, thus totally different from the contained protoplasm,
and incapable of manifesting any of the phenomena of life.

    Within the walls of cellulose the protoplasm is now closely imprisoned,

but we are not on that account to suppose that it has lost its activity, or
has abandoned its work as a living being. Though it is now no longer

in direct contact with the surrounding medium, it is not the less dependent
on it, and the reaction between the imprisoned protoplasm and the outer
world is still permitted by the permeability of the surrounding wall of

cellulose.

    When the protoplasm thus becomes surrounded by a cellulose wall it

seldom retains the uniform arrangement of its parts which is often found
in the naked cells. Minute cavities or vacuoles make their appearance in

it ; these increase in size and run one into the other, and may finally form

one large cavity in the centre, which becomes filled with a watery fluid,

known as the Cell Sap. This condition of the cell was the first observed,
and it was it which suggested the often inapplicable term ' cell.' By the

formation of this central sap cavity the surrounding protoplasm is pushed

aside, and pressed against the cellulose wall, over which it now extends
as a continuous layer. The nucleus either continues near the centre,
enveloped by a layer of protoplasm, which is connected by radiating

bands of protoplasm with that of the walls, or it accompanies the dis-

placed protoplasm, and lies embedded in this on the walls of the cell.

    We have abundant evidence to show that the imprisoned protoplasm

loses none of its activity. The Gharacce constitute an exceedingly in-
 12 REPORT-- 1879.

 teresting group of simple plants, common in the clear water of ponds and
of slowly running streams. The cells of which they are built up are

 comparatively large, and, like almost all vegetable cells, are each enclosed

in a wall of cellulose. The cellulose is perfectly transparent, and if the
 microscope, even with a low power, be brought to bear on one of these

cells, a portion of its protoplasm may be seen in active rotation, flowing
up one side of the long tubular cell and down the other, and sweeping on
with it such more solid particles as may become enveloped in its current.

In another water plant, the Valisneria spiralis, a similar active rotation

of the protoplasm may be seen in the cells of the leaf, where the con-

tinuous stream of liquid protoplasm sweeping along the green granules of
chlorophyll, and even carrying the globular nucleus with it in its current,

presents one of the most beautiful of the many beautiful phenomena

which the microscope has revealed to us.

     In many other cells with large sap-cavities, such as those which form

the stinging hairs of nettles and other kinds of vegetable hairs, the pro-

toplasmic lining of the wall may send off into the sap-cavity projecting

ridges and strings, forming an irregular network, along which, under a

high power of the microscope, a slow streaming of granules may be
witnessed. The form and position of this protoplasmic network undergo

constant changes, and the analogy with the changes of form in an Amoeba
becomes obvious. The external wall of cellulose renders it impossible for
the confined protoplasm to emit, like a naked Amoeba, pseudopodia from its
outer side ; but on the inner side there is no obstacle to the extension of
the protoplasm, and here the cavity of the cell becomes more or less com-
pletely traversed by protoplasmic projections from the wall. These often
stretch themselves out in the form of thin filaments, which, meeting with
a neighbouring one, become fused into it ; they show currents of granules
streaming along their length, and after a time become withdrawn and
disappear. The vegetable cell, in short, with its surrounding wall of
cellulose, is in all essential points a closely imprisoned Rhizopod.

     Further proof that the imprisoned protoplasm has lost by its im-
prisonment none of its essential irritability, is afforded by the fact that if
the transparent cell of a Nitella, one of the simple water-plants just
referred to, be touched under the microscope with the point of a blunt
needle, its green protoplasm will be seen to recede, under the irritation
of the needle, from the cellulose wall. If the cellulose wall of the com-
paratively large cell which forms the entire plant in a Vaucheria, a

unicellular alga, very common in shallow ditches, be ruptured under the
microscope, its protoplasm will escape, and may then be often seen to

throw out pseudopodial projections and exhibit amoeboid movements.
     Even in the higher plants, without adducing such obvious and well-

known instances as those of the Sensitive Plant and Venus's Flytrap, the
irritability of the protoplasm may be easily rendered manifest. There-
are many herbaceous plants in which if the young succulent stem of a

vigorously growing specimen receive a sharp blow, of such a nature how.*
             3

ADDRESS.  1

ever as not to bruise its tissues, or in any way wound it, the blow will
sometimes be immediately followed by a drooping of the stem com-
mencing at some distance above the point to which the stroke had been

applied : its strength appears to have here suddenly left it, it is no longer

-able to bear its own weight, and seems to be dying. The protoplasm,

however, of its cells, is in this instance not killed, it is only stunned

by the violence of the blow, and needs time for its restoration. After
remaining, it may be for some hours, in this drooping and flaccid state,
the stem begins to raise itself, and soon regains its original vigour.
This experiment will generally succeed well in plants with a rather large
terminal spike or raceme when the stroke is applied some little distance
below the inflorescence shortly before the expansion of the flower.

    In the several instances now adduced the protoplasm is in the mature
state of the plant entirely included within a wall of cellulose. Some re-
cent beautiful observations, however, of Mr. Francis Darwin, have shown
that even in the higher plants truly naked protoplasm may occur. From

the cells of certain glandular hairs contained within the cup-like recep-

tacles formed by the united bases of two opposite leaves in the Teazel
(Dipsacus) he has seen emitted long pseudopodia-like projections of the

protoplasm. What may be the significance of this very exceptional

phenomenon is still undetermined. It is probably, as Mr. Darwin sup-

poses, connected with the absorption of nitrogenous matter.
     That there is no essential difference between the protoplasm of plants

and that of animals is rendered further evident by other motor phe-
nomena, which we are in the habit of regarding as the exclusive attribute

of animals. Many of the more simply organised plants give origin to

peculiar cells called 'spores,' which separate from the parent, and, like the

seeds of the higher plants, are destined to repeat its form. In many cases
these spores are eminently locomotive. They are then termed ' swarm-

spores,' and their movements are brought about, sometimes by changes
of shape, when they move about in the manner of an Amoeba, but more
frequently by minute vibratile cilia, or by more strongly developed
flagella or whip-like projections of their protoplasm. These cilia and
flagella are absolutely indistinguishable from similar structures widely
distributed among animals, and by their vibratory or lashing strokes
upon the surrounding water the swarm-spores are rapidly carried from
place to place. In these motions they often present a curious sem-
blance of volition, for if the swarm-spore meet with an obstacle in its
course, it will, as if to avoid it, change the direction of its motion, and
retreat by a reversion of the stroke of its cilia. They are usually
attracted by light, and congregate at the light side of the vessel which
contains them, though in some cases light has the opposite effect on them
and they recede from it.

     Another fact may here be adduced to show the uniform character of
protoplasm and how very different are its properties from those of lifeless

matter, namely, the faculty which all living protoplasm possesses of
14 REPORT 1879.

resisting the entrance of colouring matter into its substance. As many

here present are aware, microscopists are in the habit of using in their

investigations various colouring matters, such as solutions of carmine^

These act differently on the different tissues, staining some, for example,

more deeply than others, and thus enabling the histologist to detect

certain elements of structure, which would otherwise remain unknown.

Now if a solution of carmine be brought into contact with living proto-

plasm, this will remain, so long as it continues alive, unaffected by the
colouring matter. But if the protoplasm be killed the carmine will at
once pervade its whole substance, and stain it throughout with a colour
more intense than even that of the colouring solution itself.

     But no more illustrative example can be offered of the properties of

protoplasm as living matter, independently of any part it may take in

organisation, than that presented by the Myxomycetae.

     The Myxomycetaa constitute a group of remarkable organisms, which,
from their comparatively large size and their consisting, during a great
part of their lives, of naked protoplasm, have afforded a fine field for
research, and have become one of the chief sources from which our know-
ledge of the nature and phenomena of protoplasm has been derived.

     They have generally been associated by botanists with the Fungi, but
though their affinities with these are perhaps closer than with any other
plants, they differ from them in so many points, especially in their deve-

lopment, as to render this association untenable. They are found in

moist situations, growing on old tan or on moss, or decaying leaves or

rotten wood, over which they spread in the form of a network of naked

protoplasmic filaments, of a soft creamy consistence, and usually of a

yellowish colour.

Under the microscope, the filaments of the network exhibit active

spontaneous movements, which, in the larger branches, are visible under

Aan ordinary lens, or even by the naked eye.  succession of undulations

may then be noticed passing along the course of the threads. Under

higher magnifying powers, a constant movement of granules may be seen

flowing along the threads, and streaming from branch to branch of this

wonderful network. Here and there offshoots of the protoplasm are
projected, and again withdrawn in the manner of the pseudopodia of an

Amoeba, while the whole organism may be occasionally seen to abandon

the support over which it had grown, and to creep over neighbouring

surfaces, thus far resembling in all respects a colossal ramified Amoeba.

It is also curiously sensitive to light, and may be sometimes found to have

retreated during the day to the dark side of the leaves, or into the recesses

of the tan over which it had been growing, and again to creep out on the

approach of night.

After a time there arise from the surface of this protoplasmic net oval

capsules or spore-cases, in which are contained the spores or reproduc-

tive bodies of the Myxomycetse. When the spore-case has arrived at ma-

turity, it bursts and allows the spores to escape. These are in the form.

central nucleus, enclosing a nucleolus, and with a clear vacuole, which
exhibits a rhythmically pulsating movement. The little naked spore thus
set at liberty is soon seen to be drawn out atone point into a long vibratile
whip-like flagellum, which by its lashing action carries the spore from
place to place. After a time the flagellum disappears, and the spore may
now be seen emitting and withdrawing finger-like pseudopodia, by means
of which it creeps about like an Amoeba, and like an Amoeba devours
solid particles by engulfing them in its soft protoplasm.

     So far these young amoeba- like Myxomycetas have enjoyed each an
independent existence. Now, however, a singular and significant pheno-

menon is presented. Two or more of these Myxamcebse, as they have been

called, approach one another, come into contact, and finally become com-
pletely fused together into a single mass of protoplasm, in which the
components are no longer to be distinguished. To the body thus formed
by the fusion of the Myxamcebas the name of ' plasmodium ' has been

given.

     The plasmodium continues, like the simple amcebiform bodies of
which it is composed, to grow by the ingestion and assimilation of solid
nutriment, which it envelopes in its substance ; it throws out ramifying
and inosculating processes, and finally becomes converted into a proto-
plasmic network, which in its turn gives rise to spore-cases with their
contained spores and thus completes the cycle of its development.

     Under certain external conditions the Myxomycetas have been observed

to pass from an active mobile state into a resting state, and this may
occur both in the amcebiform spores and in the plasmodium. When the

plasmodium is about to pass into a resting state, it usually withdraws its

finer branches and expels such solid ingesta as may be included in it. Its

motions then gradually cease, it breaks up into a multitude of polyhedral
cells, which, however, remain connected, and the whole body dries into a
horny brittle mass, known by the name of ' sclerotium.'

      In this condition, without giving the slightest sign of life, the sclero-

tium may remain for many months. Life, however, is nob destroyed, its

manifestations are only suspended, and if after an indefinite time the
apparently dead sclerotium be placed in water, it immediately begins to
swell up, the membranous covering of its component cells becomes dis-
solved and disappears, and the cells themselves flow together into an active
amoeboid plasmodium.

    We have already seen that every cell possesses an autonomy or inde-

pendent individuality, and from this we should expect that, like all living
beings, it had the faculty of multiplying itself, and of becoming the parent

of other cells. This is truly the case, and the process of cell-multiplication
has of late years been studied, with the result of adding largely to our
knowledge of the phenomena of life.
16 REPORT 1879.

     The labours of Sfcrasburger, of Auerbach, of Oscar Hertwig, of Eduard
van Beneden, Butschli, Fol, and others, here come prominently before us,

but neither the time at my disposal nor the purport of this address will
allow me to do more than call your attention to some of the more strik-

ing results of their investigations.

     By far the most frequent mode of multiplication among cells shows

itself in a spontaneous division of the protoplasm into two separate por-
tions which then become independent of one another, so that instead of
the single parent cell two new ones have made their appearance. In this
process the nucleus usually takes an important part. Strasburger has
studied it with great care in certain plant-cells, such as the so-called
'corpuscula ' or ' secondary embryo-sacs ' of the Coniferse and the cells of
Spirogyra ; and has further shown a close correspondence between cell-

division in animals and that in plants.

     It may be generally stated as the results of his observations on the

corpuscula of the Coniferse, that the nucleus of the cell about to divide
assumes a spindle shape, and at the same time presents a peculiar striated

differentiation, as if it were composed of parallel filaments reaching from

end to end of the spindle. These filaments become thickened in the middle,
and there form by the approximation of the thickened portions a transverse
plate of protoplasm (the 'nucleus-plate'). This soon splits into two
halves which recede from one another towards the poles of the spindle,
travelling in this course along the filaments, which remain continuous

from end to end. When arrived near the poles they form there two new

nuclei, still connected with one another by the intervening portion of the

spindle.

    In the equator of this intervening portion there is now formed in a

similar way a second plate of protoplasm (the ' cell-plate '), which, ex-

tending to the walls of the dividing cell, cuts the whole protoplasm into

two halves, each half containing one of the newly-formed nuclei. This

partition plate is at first single, but it soon splits into two laminae, which

become the apposed bounding surfaces of the two protoplasm masses into
Awhich the mother cell has been divided.
                                          wall of cellulose is then all at

once secreted between them, and the two daughter cells are complete.
     It sometimes happens in the generation of cells that a young brood of

· cells arises from the parent cell by what is called 'free cell- formation.'

In this only a part of the protoplasm of the mother cell is used up in the

production of the offspring. It is seen chiefly in the formation of the spores of

the lower plants, in the first foundation of the embryo in the higher, and in

--the formation of the endosperm--a cellular mass which serves as the first

nutriment for the embryo in the seeds of most Phanerogams. The for-

mation of the endosperm has been carefully studied by Strasburger in the

embryo-sac of the kidney bean, and may serve as an example of the pro-

cess of free cell-formation. The embryo-sac is morphologically a large

cell with its protoplasm, nucleus, and cellulose wall, while the endosperm

which arises within it is composed of a multitude of minute cells united
       ADDRESS.                                     17

into a tissue. The formation of the endosperm is preceded by the disso-
lution and disappearance of the nucleus of the embryo-sac, and then in the
midst of the protoplasm of the sac several new nuclei make their appear-
ance. Around each of these as a centre the protoplasm of the mother

cell is seen to have become differentiated in the form of a clear spherule,

and we have thus corresponding to each of the new nuclei a young naked
cell, which soon secretes over its surface a membrane of cellulose. The
new cells, when once formed, multiply by division, press one on the other,

and so combining into a cellular mass, constitute the completed endo-

sperm.

     Related to the formation of new cells, whether by division or by free
cell-formation, is another very interesting phenomenon of living proto-
plasm known as 'rejuvenescence.' In this the whole protoplasm of a
cell, by a new arrangement of its parts, assumes a new shape and acquires
new properties. It then abandons its cellulose chamber, and enters on a
new and independent life in the surrounding medium.

   A good example of this is afforded by the formation of swarm-spores

in Oedogonium, one of the fresh- water Algae. Here the whole of the
protoplasm of an adult cell contracts, and by the expulsion of its cell-
sap changes from a cylindrical to a globular shape. Then one spot be-
comes clear, and a pencil of vibratile cilia here shows itself. The cellu-

lose wall which had hitherto confined it now becomes ruptured, and the
protoplasmic sphere, endowed with new faculties of development and
with powers of active locomotion, escapes as a swarm spore, which, after

enjoying for a time the free life of an animal, comes to rest, and de-

velopes itself into a new plant.
     The beautiful researches which have within the last few years been

made by the observers already mentioned, on the division of animal cells,
show how close is the agreement between plants and animals in all the
leading phenomena of cell-division, and afford one more proof of the

essential unity of the two great organic kingdoms.

     There is one form of cell which, in its relation to the organic world,

possesses a significance beyond that of every other, namely, the egg. As

already stated, the egg is, wherever it occurs, a typical cell, consisting
essentially of a globule of protoplasm enveloping a nucleus (the ' germinal

vesicle'), and with one or more nucleoli (the 'germinal spots') in the
interior of the nucleus. This cell, distinguishable by no tangible cha-

racters from thousands of other cells, is nevertheless destined to run
through a definite series of developmental changes, which have as their
end the building up of an organism like that to which the egg owes its

origin.

  --It is obvious that such complex organisms as thus result composed, it
--may be, of countless millions of cells can be derived from the simple

egg cell only by a process of cell-multiplication. The birth of new cells

derived from the primary cell or egg thus lies at the basis of embryonic

development. It is here that the phenomena of cell-multiplication in the

1879.  c
18 REPORT-- 1879.

animal kingdom can in general be most satisfactorily observed, and the
greater number of recent researches into the nature of these phenomena
have found their most fertile field in the early periods of the development

of the egg.

   A discussion of the still earlier changes which the egg undergoes in

order to bring it into the condition in which cell-multiplication may be

possible, would, however full of interest, be here out of place and I shall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

--therefore confine myself to the first moments of actaal development to
--what is called ' the cleavage of the egg ' which is nothing more than a

multiplication of the egg cell by repeated division. I shall farther confine
myself to an account of this phenomenon as presented in typical cases,
leaving out of consideration certain modifications which would only
complicate and obscure our picture.

     The egg, notwithstanding the preliminary changes to which I have
alluded, is still, at the commencement of development, a true cell. It
has its protoplasm and its nucleus, and it is, as a rule, enveloped in a
delicate membrane. The protoplasm forms what is known as the vitellus,

or yolk, and the surrounding membrane is called the ' vitellary mem-
brane.' The division which is now about to take place in it is introduced

by a change of form in the nucleus. This becomes elongated, and assumes
the shape of a spindle, similar to what we have already seen in the cell-

division of plants. On each pole of the spindle transparent protoplasm

collects, forming here a clear spherical area.

     At this time a very striking and characteristic phenomenon is
witnessed in the egg. Bach pole of the spindle has become the centre of
a system of rays which stream out in all directions into the surrounding
protoplasm. The protoplasm thus shows, enveloped in its mass, two
sun-like figures, whose centres are connected to one another by the
spindle-shaped nucleus. To this, with the sun-like rays streaming from
its poles, Auerbach gives the name of ' Karyolitic figure,' suggested by
its connection with the breaking up of the original nucleus, to which our
attention must next be directed.

   A phenomenon similar to one we have already seen in cell-division

among plants now shows itself. The nucleus becomes broken up into
a number of filaments, which lie together in a bundle, each filament

stretching from pole to pole of the spindle. Exactly in its central point
every filament shows a knot-like enlargement, and from the close approxi-
mation of the knots there results a thick zone of protoplasm in the
equator of the spindle. Each knot soon divides into two halves, and
t.'ach half recedes from the equator and travels along the filament towards

its extremity. When arrived at the poles of the spindle each set of half-

knots becomes fused together into a globular body, while the intervening
portion of the spindle, becoming torn up, and gradually drawn into the

substance of the two globular masses, finally disappears. And now,
instead of the single fusiform nucleus whose changes we have been
tracing, we have two new globular nuclei, each occupying the place of
ADDRESS.  19

one of its poles, and formed at its expense. 9 The egg now begins to

divide along a plane at right angles to a line connecting the two nuclei.

The division takes place without the formation of a cell-plate such as we

saw in the division of the plant cell, and is introduced by a constriction

of its protoplasm, which commences at the circumference just within the

vitelline membrane, and, extending towards the centre, divides the whole

mass of protoplasm into two halves, each including within it one of the

new nuclei. Thus the simple cell which constituted the condition of the

egg at the commencement of development becomes divided into two

similar cells. This forms the first stage of cleavage. Bach of these two

young cells divides in its turn in a direction at right angles to the first

division-plane, while by continued repetition of the same act the whole

of the protoplasm or yolk becomes broken up into a vast multitude of

--cells, and the unicellular organism the egg, with which we began our
--history has become converted into an organism composed of many

thousands of cells. This is one of the most widely distributed phenomena

of the organic world. It is called ' the cleavage of the egg,' and con-

sists essentially in the production, by division, of successive broods of

--cells from a single ancestral cell the egg.

    It is no part of my purpose to carry on the phenomena of develop-
ment further than this. Such of my hearers as may desire to become

acquainted with the further history of the embryo, I would refer to the

excellent address delivered two years ago at the Plymouth meeting of

--the Association by one of my predecessors in this chair Prof. Allen

Thompson.

    That protoplasm, however, may present a phenomenon the reverse of

that in which a simple cell becomes multiplied into many, is shown by

--a phenomenon already referred to the production of plasmodia in the

Myxomycetse by the fusion into one another of cells originally distinct.

     The genus Myriothela will afford another example in which the for-

mation of plasmodia becomes introduced into the cycle of development.

    9 Though none of the above-mentioned observers to whom we owe our knowledge

of the phenomena here described seem to have thought of connecting the fibrous
condition assumed by the spindle with any special structure of the quiescent nucleus,
it is highly probable that it consists in a rearrangement of fibres already present.
That this is really the case is borne out by the observations of Schleicher on the
division of cartilage cells. (Die KnorpelaelltJieihmg. Arch, fur Mikr. Anat. Band
xvi. Heft 2. 1878.) From these it would appear that in the division of cartilage
cells the investing membrane of the nucleus first becomes torn up, and then the
filaments, rodlets, and granules, which, according to him, form its body, enter into
a state of intense motor activity, and may be seen arranging themselves into star-
like, or wreath-like, or irregular figures, while the whole nucleus, now deprived of
its membrane, may wander about the cell, travelling towards one of its poles, and
then towards the other ; or it may at one time contract, and then again dilate, to
such an extent as nearly to fill the entire cell. To this nuclear activity Streicher
applies the term ' Karyokinesis.' It results in a nearly parallel arrangement of the
nuclear filaments. Then these converge at their extremities and become more
widely separated in the middle, so as to give to the nucleus the form of a spindle.
The filaments then become fused together at each pole of the spindle, so as to form
the two new nuclei, which are at first nearly homogeneous, but which afterwards
become broken up into their component filaments, rods, and granules.

The primitive eggs are here, as elsewhere, true cells with nucleo-
lated nuclei, but without any boundary membrane. They are formed in

considerable numbers, but remain only for a short time separate and

distinct. After this they begin to exhibit amoeboid changes of shape,

project pseudopodial prolongations which coalesce with those of others in

their vicinity, and finally a multitude of these primitive ova become fused

together into a common plasmodium, in which, as in the simple egg cell

of other animals, the phenomena of development take place.

In many of the lower plants a very similar coalescence is known to

take place between the protoplasmic bodies of separate cells, and con-

stitutes the phenomenon of conjugation. Spirogyra is a genus of Algae,
consisting of long green threads common in ponds. Every thread is
composed of a series of cylindrical cb ambers of transparent cellulose

placed end to end, each containing a sac of protoplasm with a large

quantity of cell-sap, and with a green band of chlorophyll wound spirally

on its walls. When the threads have attained their full growth they

approach one another in pairs, and lie in close proximity, parallel one to

Athe other.    communication is then established by means of short con-

necting tubes between the chambers of adjacent filaments, and across

the channel thus formed the whole of the protoplasm of one of the con-

jugating chambers passes into the cavity of the other, and then imme-

diately fuses with the protoplasm it finds there. The single mass thus
formed shapes itself into a solid oval body, known as a ' zygospore.'

This now frees itself from the filament, secretes over its naked surface

a new wall of cellulose, and, when placed in the conditions necessary for

its development, attaches itself by one end, and then, by repeated acts of

cell-division, grows into a many-celled filament like those in which it

originated.

The formation of plasmodia, regarded as a coalescence and absolute

fusion into one another of separate naked masses of protoplasm, is a

phenomenon of great significance. It is highly probable that, notwith-

standing the complete loss of individuality in the combining elements,

such difference as may have been present in these will always find itself

--expressed in the properties of the resulting plasmodia a fact of great

importance in its bearing on the phenomena of inheritance. Recent

researches, indeed, render it almost certain that fertilisation, whether in

the animal or the vegetable kingdom, consists essentially in the coales-

cence and consequent loss of individuality of the protoplasmic contents

of two cells.

In by far the greater number of plants the protoplasm of most of the

cells which are exposed to the sunlight undergoes a curious and important

differentiation, part of it becoming separated from the remainder in the

form usually of green granules, known as chlorophyll granules. The

chlorophyll granules thus consist of true protoplasm, their colour being

due to the presence of a green colouring matter, which may be extracted,

leaving behind the colourless protoplasmic base.
                                  ADDRESS.                                                                        21

     The colouring matter of chlorophyll presents under the spectroscope
a very characteristic spectrum. For our knowledge of its optical pro-

perties, on which time will not now permit me to dwell, we are mainly
indebted to the researches of your townsman, Dr. Sorby, who has made

these the subject of a series of elaborate investigations, which have con-

tributed largely to the advancement of an important department of

physical science.

     That the chlorophyll is a living substance, like the uncoloured proto-

plasm of the cell, is sufficiently obvious. When once formed, the chloro-
phyll granule may grow by intussusception of nutriment to many times
its original size, and may multiply itself by division.

     To the presence of chlorophyll is due one of the most striking aspects

--of external nature the green colour of the vegetation which clothes the

surface of the earth ; and with its formation is introduced a function of
fundamental importance in the economy of plants, for it is on the cells

which contain this substance that devolves the faculty of decomposing

carbonic acid. On this depends the assimilation of plants, a process
which becomes manifest externally by the exhalation of oxygen. Now it

is under the influence of light on the chlorophyll-containing cells that
this evolution of oxygen is brought about. The recent observations of

Draper and of Pfeffer have shown that in this action the solar spectrum is

not equally effective in all its parts ; that the yellow and least refrangible

rays are  those which  act  with  most  intensity                                           that the violet  and  other
                                                                                         ;

highly refrangible rays of the visible spectrum take but a very subordi-

nate part in assimilation ; and that the invisible rays which lie beyond the

violet are totally inoperative.

    In almost every grain of chlorophyll one or more starch granules may

be seen. This starch is chemically isomeric with the cellulose cell-wall,

with woody fibre, and other hard parts of plants, and is one of the most

important products of assimilation. When plants whose chlorophyll

contains starch are left for a sufficient time in darkness, the starch is

absorbed and completely disappears ; but when they are restored to the

light the starch reappears in the chlorophyll of the cells.

     With this dependence of assimilation on the presence of chlorophyll
a new physiological division of labour is introduced into the life of

plants. In the higher plants, while the work of assimilation is allocated
to the chlorophyll- containing cells, that of cell division and growth

devolves on another set of cells, which, lying deeper in the plant, are

removed from the direct action of light, and in which chlorophyll is

therefore never produced. In certain lower plants, in consequence of their

simplicity of structure and the fact that all the cells are equally exposed
to the influence of light, this physiological division of labour shows
itself in a somewhat different fashion. Thus in some of the simple

green algas, such as Sjnrogyra and Hydrodictyon, assimilation takes place
as in other cases during the day, while their cell division and growth

takes place chiefly, if not exclusively, at night. Strasburger, in his re-
22 REPORT-- 1879.

markable observations on cell divisions in Spirogyra, was obliged to adopt
an artificial device in order to compel tbe Spirogyra to postpone the
division of its cells to tbe morning.

     Here tbe functions of assimilation and growtb devolve on one and tbe
same cell, but wbile one of tbese functions is exercised only during tbe
day, tbe time for tbe otber is tbe nigbt. It seems impossible for tbe
same cell at tbe same time to exercise botb functions, and tbese are bere
accordingly divided between different periods of tbe twenty-four bours.

     Tbe action of chloropbyll in bringing about tbe decomposition of
carbonic acid is not, as was recently believed, absolutely confined to plants.
In some of tbe lower animals, sucb as Stentor and otber infusoria, tbe
Green Hydra, and certain green planarias and otber worms, cbloropbyll is
differentiated in their protoplasm, and probably always acts bere under

tbe influence of ligbt exactly as in plants.

     Indeed, it bas been proved10 by some recent researches of Mr. Geddes,
tbat the green planarias when placed in water and exposed to the sun-
light give out bubbles of gas which contain from 44 to 55 per cent, of
oxygen. Mr. Geddes has further shown tbat these animals contain
granules of starch in their tissues, and in this fact we have another
striking point of resemblance between them and plants.

    A similar approximation of the two organic kingdoms has been shown

--by tbe beautiful researches of Mr. Darwin confirmed and extended by
--bis son, Mr. Francis Darwin on Drosera and other so-called carnivorous

plants. These researches, as is now well known, have shown that in all

carnivorous plants there is a mechanism fitted for the capture of living
prey, and that the animal matter of the prey is absorbed by the plant
after having been digested by a secretion which acts like the gastric

juice of animals.

     Again, Nageli bas recently shown 11 that the cell of tbe yeast fungus
contains about 2 per cent, of peptine, a substance hitherto known only as
a product of tbe digestion of azotised matter by animals.

     Indeed, all recent research has been bringing out in a more and more

--decisive manner the fact that there is no dualism in life, that the life of

the animal and the life of the plant are, like their protoplasm, in all

essential points identical.

     But there is, perhaps, nothing which shows more strikingly the
identity of the protoplasm in plants and animals, and the absence of any
deep-pervading difference between the life of the animal and that of the

plant, than the fact that plants may be placed, just like animals, under

the influence of anesthetics.

    "When tbe vapour of chloroform or of ether is inhaled by the human

subject, it passes into the lungs, where it is absorbed by the blood, and

thence carried by the circulation to all the tissues of the body. The

first to be affected by it is the delicate nervous element of the brain, and

loss of consciousness is the result. If the action of the anaesthetic be

continued, all the other tissues are in their turn attacked by it and their

Airritability arrested.  set of phenomena entirely parallel to these may

be presented by plants.

    We owe to Claude Bernard a series of interesting and most instructive

experiments on the action of ether and chloroform on plants. He exposed

to the vapour of ether a healthy and vigorous sensitive plant, by confining
it under a bell-glass into which he introduced a sponge filled with ether.

At the end of half an hour the plant was in a state of anaesthesia, all its

leaflets remained fully extended, but they showed no tendency to shrink
when touched. It was then withdrawn from the influence of the ether,
when it gradually recovered its irritability, and finally responded, as be-

fore, to the touch.

     It is obvious that the irritability of the protoplasm was here arrested

by the anaesthetic, so that the plant became unable to give a response to

the action of an external stimulus.
     It is not, however, the irritability of the protoplasm of only the motor

elements of plants that anaesthetics are capable of arresting. These may

act also on the protoplasm of those cells whose function lies in chemical
synthesis, such as is manifested in the phenomena of the germination of
the seed and in nutrition generally, and Claude Bernard has shown that

germination is suspended by the action of ether or chloroform.

Seeds of cress, a plant whose germination is very rapid, were placed

in conditions favourable to a speedy germination, and while thus placed
were exposed to the vapour of ether. The germination, which would
otherwise have shown itself by the next day, was arrested. For five or
six days the seeds were kept under the influence of the ether, and showed
during this time no disposition to germinate. They were not killed,

however, they only slept, for on the substitution of common air for the

etherised air with which they had been surrounded, germination at once

set in and proceeded with activity.
     Experiments were also made on that function of plants by which they

absorb carbonic acid and exhale oxygen, and which, as we have already

seen, is carried on through the agency of the green protoplasm or

--chlorophyll, under the influence of light a function which is commonly,

but erroneously, called the respiration of plants.

Aquatic plants afford the most convenient subjects for such experi-

ments. If one of these be placed in a jar of water holding ether or
chloroform in solution, and a bell-glass be placed over the submerged

plant, we shall find that the plant no longer absorbs carbonic acid or

emits oxygen. It remains, however, quite green and healthy. In order

to awaken the plant, it is only necessary to place it in non-etherised water,
when it will begin once more to absorb carbonic acid, and exhale oxygen

under the influence of sunlight.

--24 report 1879.

     The same great physiologist has also investigated the action of anaes-
thetics on fermentation. It is well known that alcoholic fermentation is
due to the presence of a minute fungus, the yeast fungus, the living
protoplasm of whose cells has the property of separating solutions of
sugar into alcohol, which remains in the liquid, and carbonic acid, which

escapes into the air.

     Now, if the yeast plant be placed along with sugar in etherised water
it will no longer act as a ferment. It is anaesthesiated, and cannot re-
spond to the stimulus which, under ordinary circumstances, it would
find in the presence of the sugar. If, now, it be placed on a filter, and
the ether washed completely away, it will, on restoration to a saccharine
liquid, soon resume its duty of separating the sugar into alcohol and

carbonic acid.

     Claude Bernard has further called attention to a very significant fact
which is observable in this experiment. While the proper alcoholic
fermentation is entirely arrested by the etherisation of the yeast plant,
there still goes on in the saccharine solution a curious chemical change,
the cane sugar of the solution being converted into grape sugar, a
substance identical in its chemical composition with the cane sugar, but

different in its molecular constitution. Now it is well known from the

researches of Bertholet that this conversion of cane sugar into grape
sugar is due to a peculiar inversive ferment, which, while it accompanies
the living yeast plant, is itself soluble and destitute of life. Indeed it
has been shown that in its natural conditions the yeast fungus is unable

of itself to assimilate cane sugar, and that in order that this may be

brought into a state fitted for the nutrition of the fungus, it must be
first digested and converted into grape sugar, exactly as happens in our
own digestive organs. To quote Claude Bernard's graphic account :

     ' The fungus ferment has thus beside it in the same yeast a sort of
servant given by nature to effect this digestion. The servant is the
unorganised inversive ferment. This ferment is soluble, and as it is not a
plant, but an unorganised body destitute of sensibility, it has not gone to
sleep under the action of the ether, and thus continues to fulfil its task.'

      In the experiment already recorded on the germination of seeds the
interest is by no means confined to that which attaches itself to the arrest
of the organising functions of the seed, those namely which manifest
themselves in the development of the radicle and plumule and other organs
of the young plant. Another phenomenon of great significance becomes

--at the same time apparent the anaesthetic exerts no action on the concom-

itant chemical phenomena which in germinating seeds show themselves
in the transformation of starch into sugar under the influence of diastase
(a soluble and non-living ferment which also exists in the seed), and the
absorption of oxygen with the exhalation of carbonic acid. These go on
as usual, the anaesthesiated seed continuing to respire, as proved by the
accumulation of carbonic acid in the surrounding air. The presence of
the carbonic acid was rendered evident by placing in the same vessel
ADDRESS.  25

-with the seeds which were the object of the experiment a solution of

barytes, when the carbonate became precipitated from the solution in

quantity equal to that produced in a similar experiment with seeds ger-

minating in unetherised air.
     So, also, in the experiment which proves that the faculty possessed by

the chlorophyllian cells of absorbing carbonic acid and exhaling oxygen

under the influence of light may be arrested by anaesthetics, it could be

seen that the plant, while in a state of anaesthesia, continued to respire in

the manner of animals : that is, it continued to absorb oxygen and exhale
carbonic acid. This is the true respiratory function which was previously
masked by the predominant function of assimilation, which devolves on
the green cells of plants, and which manifests itself under the influence
of light in the absorption of carbonic acid and the exhalation of oxygen.

     It must not, however, be supposed that the respiration of plants is
entirely independent of life. The conditions which bring the oxygen of
the air and the combustible matter of the respiring plant into such rela-

tions as may allow them to act on one another are still under its control,
and we must conclude that in Claude Bernard's experiment the anaes-

thesia had not been carried so far as to arrest such properties of the

living tissues as are needed for this.

     The quite recent researches of Schiitzenberger, who has investigated

the process of respiration as it takes place in the cell of the yeast fungus,

have shown that vitality is a factor in this process. He has shown that

fresh yeast, placed in water, breathes like an aquatic animal, disengaging
carbonic acid, and causing the oxygen contained in the water to dis-
appear. That this phenomenon is a function of the living cell is proved
by the fact that, if the yeast be first heated to 60° C. and then placed
in the oxygenated water, the quantity of oxygen in the water remains

unchanged ; in other words, the yeast ceases to breathe.
     Schiitzenberger has further shown that light exerts no influence on

--the respiration of the yeast cell that the absorption of oxygen by the

cell takes place in the dark exactly as in sunlight. On the other hand,

the influence of temperature is well marked. Respiration is almost

entirely arrested at temperatures below 10° C, it reaches its maximum at

about 40° C, while at 60° C. it again ceases.

      All this proves that the respiration of living beings is identical,
whether manifested in the plant or in the animal. It is essentially a

--destructive phenomenon as much so as the burning of a piece of

charcoal in the open air, and, like it, is characterised by the disappear-

ance of oxygen and the formation of carbonic acid.
     One of the most valuable results of the recent careful application of

the experimental method of research to the life phenomena of plants
is thus the complete demolition of the supposed antagonism between

respiration in plants and that in animals.

I have thus endeavoured to give you in a few broad outlines a sketch

of the nature and properties of one special modification of matter, which

will yield to none other in the interest which attaches to its study, and in

the importance of the part allocated to it in the economy of nature. Did

the occasion permit I might have entered into many details which I have

left untouched                                                                   but enough has been said to  convince you that  in  proto-
                                                                              ;

plasm we find the only form of matter in which life can manifest itself

--and that, though the outer conditions of life heat, air, water, food

may all be present, protoplasm would still be needed, in order that these

conditions may be utilised, in order that the energy of lifeless nature may

be converted into that of the countless multitudes of animal and vege-

table forms which dwell upon the surface of the earth or people the

great depths of its seas.

   We are thus led to the conception of an essential unity in the two

--great kingdoms of organic Nature a structural unity, in the fact that

every living being has protoplasm as the essential matter of every living

element of its structure ; and a physiological unity, in the universal

attribute of irritability which has its seat in this same protoplasm, and is

the prime mover of every phenomenon of life.

   We have seen how little mere form has to do with the essential

properties of protoplasm. This may shape itself into cells, and the cells

may combine into organs in ever-increasing complexity, and protoplasm
force may be thus intensified, and, by the mechanism of organisation,

turned to the best possible account ; but we must still go back to pro-

--toplasm as a naked formless plasma if we would find freed from all
--non-essential complications the agent to which has been assigned the

duty of building up structure and of transforming the energy of lifeless

matter into that of living.

To suppose, however, that all protoplasm is identical where no

difference cognisable by any means at our disposal can be detected would

be an error. Of two particles of protoplasm, between which we may

defy all the power of the microscope, all the resources of the laboratory,

to detect a difference, one can develope only to a jelly-fish, the other only

--to a man, and one conclusion alone is here possible- that deep within

them there must be a fundamental difference which thus determines their

inevitable destiny, but of which we know nothing, and can assert nothing

beyond the statement that it must depend on their hidden molecular

constitution.

In the molecular condition of protoplasm there is probably as much

complexity as in the disposition of organs in the most highly differentiated

organisms ; and between two masses of protoplasm indistinguishable from

one another there may be as much molecular difference as there is between

the form and arrangement of organs in the most widely separated animals

or plants.

Herein lies the many-sidedness of protoplasm ; herein lies its sig-

nificance as the basis of all morphological expression, as the agent of
                     ADDRESS.  27

all physiological work, while in all this there must be an adaptiveness
to purpose as great as any claimed for the most complicated organism.

     From the facts which have been now brought to your notice there is

--but one legitimate conclusion that life is a property of protoplasm. In

this assertion there is nothing that need startle us. The essential pheno-
mena of living beiugs are not so widely separated from the phenomena of
lifeless matter as to render it impossible to recognise an analogy between
them : for even irritability, the one grand character of all living beings,
is not more difficult to be conceived of as a property of matter than the

physical phenomena of radial energy.

     It is quite true that between lifeless and living matter there is a vast
difference, a difference greater far than any which can be found between
the most diverse manifestations of lifeless matter. Though the refined

synthesis of modern chemistry may have succeeded in forming a few

principles which until lately had been deemed the proper product of
vitality, the fact still remains that no one has ever yet built up one par-

ticle of living matter out of lifeless elements-- that every living creature,
from the simplest dweller on the confines of organisation up to the

highest and most complex organism, has its origin in pre-existent living

--matter that the protoplasm of to-day is but the continuation of the

protoplasm of other ages, handed down to us through periods of inde-

finable and indeterminable time.

    Yet with all this, vast as the differences may be, there is nothing

which precludes a comparison of the properties of living matter with

those of lifeless.

    When, however, we say that life is a property of protoplasm, we
assert as much as we are justified in doing. Here we stand upon the

boundary between life in its proper conception, as a group of phenomena
having irritability as their common bond, and that other and higher

group of phenomena which we designate as consciousness or thought,

and which, however intimately connected with those of life, are yet

essentially distinct from them.
     "When the heart of a recently killed frog is separated from its body

and touched with the point of a needle, it begins to beat under the exci-

tation of the stimulus, and we believe ourselves justified in referring the

contraction of the cardiac fibres to the irritability of their protoplasm as

Weits proper cause.  see in it a remarkable phenomenon, but one never-

theless in which we can see unmistakable analogies with phenomena

purely physical. There is no greater difficulty in conceiving of contrac-

tility as a property of protoplasm than there is in conceiving of attraction

as a property of the magnet.

    When a thought passes through the mind, it is associated, as we have

now abundant reason for believing, with some change in the protoplasm

of the cerebral cells. Are we, therefore, justified in regarding thought

as a property of the protoplasm of these cells, in the sense in which we
28 report-- 1879.

regard muscular contraction as a property of the protoplasm of muscle ?

or is it really a property residing in something far different, but which

may yet need for its manifestation the activity of cerebral protoplasm ?

If we could see any analogy between thought and any one of the

admitted phenomena of matter, we should "be bound to accept the first

of these conclusions as the simplest, and as affording a hypothesis most

in accordance with the comprehensiveness of natural laws ; but between
thought and the physical phenomena of matter there is not only no

analogy, but there is no conceivable analogy ; and the obvious and con-
tinuous path which we have hitherto followed up in our reasonings from

the phenomena of lifeless matter through those of living matter here

comes suddenly to an end. The chasm between unconscious life and

thought is deep and impassable, and no transitional phenomena can be

found by which as by a bridge we may span it over ; for even from
irritability, to which, on a superficial view, consciousness may seem

related, it is as absolutely distinct as it is from any of the ordinary

phenomena of matter.

It has been argued that because physiological activity must be a pro-

perty of every living cell, psychical activity must be equally so, and the

language of the metaphysician has been carried into biology, and the ' cell

soul ' spoken of as a conception inseparable from that of life.

That psychical phenomena however, characterised as they essentially

are by consciousness, are not necessarily coextensive with those of life,

Howthere cannot be a doubt.  far back in the scale of life consciousness

may exist we have as yet no means of determining, nor is it necessary for

our argument that we should. Certain it is that many things, to all ap-

pearance the result of volition, are capable of being explained as abso-

lutely unconscious acts ; and when the swimming swarm-spore of an alga
avoids collision, and by a reversal of the stroke of its cilia backs from

an obstacle lying in its course, there is almost certainly in all this nothing

but a purely unconscious act. It is but a case in which we find expressed

the great law of the adaptation of living beings to the conditions which

surround them. The irritability of the protoplasm of the ciliated spore

responding to an external stimulus sets in motion a mechanism derived

by inheritance from its ancestors, and whose parts are correlated to a

--common end the preservation of the individual.

But even admitting that every living cell were a conscious and think-

ing being, are we therefore justified in asserting that its consciousness like

its irritability is a property of the matter of which it is composed ? The

sole argument on which this view is made to rest is that from analogy.

It is argued that because the life phenomena, which are invariably found

in the cell, must be regarded as a property of the cell, the phenomena of

consciousness by which they are accompanied must be also so regarded.

The weak point in the argument is the absence of all analogy between the

things compared, and as the conclusion rests solely on the argument from

analogy, the two must fall to the ground together.

--In a lecture 12 to which I once had the pleasure of listening a lecture

characterised no less by lncid exposition than by the fascinating form in

which its facts were presented to the hearers, Professor Huxley argues

that no difference, however great, between the phenomena of living

matter and those of the lifeless elements of which this matter is composed

should militate against our attributing to protoplasm the phenomena of

life as properties essentially inherent in it ; since we know that the result

of a chemical combination of physical elements may exhibit physical

properties totally different from those of the elements combined ; the
physical phenomena presented by water, for example, having no resem-

blance to those of its combining elements oxygen and hydrogen.

I believe that Professor Huxley intended to apply this argument only

to the phenomena of life in the stricter sense of the word. As such it is

conclusive. But if it be pushed further, and extended to the phenomena

of consciousness, it loses all its force. The analogy, perfectly valid in the

former case, here fails. The properties of the chemical compound are

like those of its components, still physical properties. They come within

the wide category of the universally accepted properties of matter, while

--those of consciousness belong to a category absolutely distinct one

which presents not a trace of a connection with any of those which

physicists have agreed in assigning to matter as its proper characteristics.

The argument thus breaks down, for its force depends on analogy alone,

and here all analogy vanishes.

That consciousness is never manifested except in the presence of

cerebral   matter  or of something like it, there  cannot be a  question                                          but
                                                                                                               ;

this is a very different thing from its being a property of such matter in

the sense in which polarity is a property of the magnet, or irritability of

protoplasm. The generation of the rays which lie invisible beyond the

violet in the spectrum of the sun cannot be regarded as a property of the

medium which by changing their refrangibility can alone render them

apparent.

     I know that there is a special charm in those broad generalisations
which would refer many very different phenomena to a common source.
But in this very charm there is undoubtedly a danger, and we must be all
the more careful lest it should exert an influence in arresting the progress

of truth, just as at an earlier period traditional beliefs exerted an authority

from which the mind but slowly and with difficulty succeeded in emanci-

pating itself.

But have we, it may be asked, made in all this one step forward

towards an explanation of the phenomena of consciousness or the discovery

of its source ? Assuredly not. The power of conceiving of a substance

different from that of matter is still beyond the limits of human intelli-

gence, and the physical or objective conditions which are the concomi-

tants of thought are the only ones of which it is possible to know

anything, and the only ones whose study is of value.

   We are not, however, on that account forced to the conclusion that

there is nothing in the universe but matter and force. The simplest
physical law is absolutely inconceivable by the highest of the brutes, and

no one would be justified in assuming that man had already attained the
limit of his powers. Whatever may be that mysterious bond which

--connects organisation with psychical endowments, the one grand fact
--fact of inestimable importance stands out clear and freed from all

obscurity and doubt, that from the first dawn of intelligence there is

with every advance in organisation a corresponding advance in mind.

Mind as well as body is thus travelling onwards through higher and still

higher phases ; the great law of Evolution is shaping the destiny of our

race ; and though now we may at most but indicate some weak point in

the generalisation which would refer consciousness as well as life to a

common material source, who can say that in the far off future there
may not yet be evolved other and higher faculties from which light may
stream in upon the darkness, and reveal to man the great mystery of

Thought ?

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William

   Siemens, Mr. F. J. Bramwell, and Mr. J. T. Bottomley, for com-
   mencing Secular Experiments upon the Elasticity of Wires.
  Drawn up by J. T. Bottomley.

At the last meeting of the British Association, the arrangements for sus-

pending wires for secular experiments in the tube which has been erected

in the tower of the Glasgow University Buildings, and for observing these
wires, were described and reported as complete. Some improvements
have since been found necessary ; but, so far as these are concerned, there

is not much to add to the report then given.

The long iron tube has been closed at the top and bottom so as to keep
out currents
caulked.      of  air  and  dust,  and the  joints  of  the  tube  have  been  carefullJy

     Some improvements in the cathetometer used for observing the marks
on the wires were also found to be required, but the instrument is now

satisfactory.

     Six wires have now been suspended in the tube; their stretching
weights have been attached to them, and they have been carefully marked

and measured. These wires are suspended in pairs-- two of gold, two of
platinum, and two of palladium. One of each of the pairs is loaded with
a weight equal to one-twentieth of its breaking weight, and the other of
each pair with a weight equal to one-half of its breaking weight. The
points of suspension for each pair are very close together, so that any
yielding of the place of support affects both wires equally.

     Each wire is marked with paint marks, and there are other marks on
the wires and on the weights attached to them where positions have been
determined. These marks are described in a laboratory book which is at
present kept in the room of the Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
University of Glasgow. The measurements that have been made, and
the experiments that have been undertaken in connection with the work

assigned to the Committee, are all being entered in this book. This,

however, can only be regarded as a temporary mode of keeping these

records.

     It is intended that the record in this book shall contain
     1. Description of the tube and arrangements for suspending the wires,
and for suspending additional wires at future times, and description of the
mode of attachment of the stretching weights.
     2. Description of the cathetometer and method of measuring the

changes, should there be any, in the lengths of the wires.
     3. Description of the wires themselves, and record of experiments that

have already been made on them as to breaking weight and Young's

Modulus of Elasticity.
     4. Description of the marks put on the wires, and record of the mea-

surements that have been made as to the lengths of the wires and as to
the relative positions of the marks at the time of suspending the wires.

     The stretching weights and the clamps attached to the wires are en-
graved each with the amount of its weight in grammes. The measure-
ments are all made in grammes and centimetres.

     It seems desirable, considering the nature of the experiments that are

just now commencing, that information regarding them should be pre-
served to the British Association in some appropriate way ; and that pro-
vision should be made for recording every change that may take place,

and for communicating from time to time to the Association such infor-

mation as may be obtained.

     In the report presented to the Association by this Committee last year,
it was mentioned that experiments had been commenced in the laboratory
of the University of Glasgow in connection with the present investigation

on the effects of stress maintained for a considerable time in altering the

elastic properties of various wires. These experiments are still being

carried on, and results of interest and importance have been already

arrived at.

     The most important of these experiments form a series that have been
made on the elastic properties of very soft iron wire. The wire used was
drawn for the purpose, and is extremely soft and very uniform. It is
about No. 20 B.W.G., and its breaking weight, tested in the ordinary way,
is about 45 lbs. This wire has been hung up in lengths of about 20 feet,
and broken by weights applied, the breaking being performed more or less

slowly.

     In the first place, some experiments have been tried as to the smallest

weight which, applied very cautiously and with precautions against letting

the weight run down with sensible velocity, will break the wire. These

experiments have not yet been very satisfactorily carried out, but it is

intended to complete them.

    The other experiments have been carried out in the following way :

It was found that a weight of 28 lbs. does not give permanent elongation

to the wire taken as it was supplied by the wire-drawer. Each length of

the wire, therefore, as soon as it was hung up for experiment, was weighted

with 28 lbs., and this weight was left hanging on the wire for 24 hours.

Weights were then added till the wire broke, measurements as to

Aelongation being taken at the same time.  large number of wires were

broken with equal additions of weight, a pound at a time, at intervals of

--from three to five minutes care being taken in all cases, however, not to

add fresh weight if the wire could be seen to be running down under the

effect of the weight last added. Some were broken with weights added at
       ON SECULAR EXPERIMENTS UPON THE ELASTICITY OF WIRES. 35

the rate of one pound per day, some with three quarters of a pound per

day, and some with half a pound per day. One experiment was com-
menced in which it was intended to break the wire at a very much slower

rate than any of these. It was carried on for some months, but the wire

unfortunately rusted, and broke at a place which was seen to be very
Amuch eaten away by rust, and with a very low breaking weight.
                                                                 fresh

wire has been suspended, and is now being tested. It has been painted

with oil, and has now been under experiment for several months.

The following tables will show the general results of these experi-

ments. It will be seen, in the first place, that the prolonged application

of stress has a very remarkable effect in increasing the strength of soft

iron wire. Comparing the breaking weights for the wire quickly broken

with those for the same wire slowly broken, it will be seen that in the

latter case the strength of the wire is from two to ten per cent, higher

than in the former, and is on the average about five or six per cent,

higher. The result as to elongation is even more remarkable, and was

certainly more unexpected. It will seen from the tables that, in the

case of the wire quickly drawn out, the elongation is on the average more

than three times as great as in the case of the wire drawn out slowly.

There are two wires for which the breaking weights and elongations are

given in the tables, both of them ' bright ' wires, which showed this

difference very remarkably. They broke without showing any special

peculiarity as to breaking weight, and without known difference as to

treatment, except in the time during which the application of the break-

ing weight was made. One of them broke with 44£ lbs., the experiment

lasting one hour and a-half; the other with 47 lbs., the time occupied
in applying the weight being thirty-nine days. The former was drawn

out by 28 - 5 per cent, on its original length, the latter by only 479 per

cent.

    Mathematics and Physics ; the Committee consisting of Professor

    Gr. Caret Foster (Secretary), Professor W. Gr. Adams, Professor E.

    B. Clifton, Professor Caylet, Professor J. D. Everett, Professor

    Clerk Maxwell, Lord Eayleigh, Professor Gr. Gr. Stokes, Professor
    Balfour Stewart, Mr. Spottiswoode, and Professor P. Gr. Tait.

Owing to unforeseen circumstances only one meeting of this Committee

has taken place during the past year. It seems desirable, nevertheless, in

order that the question of the reappointment of the Committee may be
fully considered, and that there may be a fall expression of opinions on
the subject referred to it, that a statement should be made to the Section

of the proceedings of the Committee, the more so since, in the hope that
greater progress would have been made by this time, no report was
presented at the last meeting of the Association.

     The first matter discussed by the Committee was the character and
general plan of the reports which they should endeavour to procure ; the
next was to what extent or in what manner the production of such reports

could be aided by the Committee. Important contributions to the dis-

cussion of these questions are contained in written communications to the

--Committee from two of its members Professors Clerk Maxwell and

Stokes. Professor Clerk Maxwell writes as follows :

     ' Reports on special branches of science may be of several different

types, corresponding to every stage of organisation, from the catalogue
up to the treatise.

    When' a person is engaged in scientific research, it is desirable that

he should be able to ascertain, with as little labour as possible, what has
been written on the subject and who are the best authorities. The ordinary
method is to get hold of the most recent German paper on the subject,
to look up the references there given, and by following up the trail of
each to find out who are the most influential authors on the subject.
German papers have the most complete references because the machinery
for docketing and arranging scientific papers is more developed in Ger-
many than elsewhere.

     ' The " Fortschritte der Physik " gave an annual list of all papers,
good and bad, arranged in subjects, with abstracts of the more important
ones. Wiedemann's " Beiblatter " is a more select assortment, given
more in full.

      ' I think it doubtful whether a publication of this kind, if undertaken
by the British Association, would succeed. Lists of the titles of the pro-
ceedings of Societies and of the contents of periodicals are given in
" Nature." These are useful for strictly contemporary science, and I do
not think that a more elaborate system of collection could be kept up

for long.

     ' The intending publisher of a discovery has to examine the whole mass
of science to see whether he has been anticipated, but the student wishes

to read only what is worth reading. What he requires is the names of

the best authors. The selection or election of these is constantly done
by skimming individual authors, who indicate by the names they quote
the men whose opinions have had most influence. But a report on the

history and present state of a science lias for its main aim to enumerate
the various authors and to point out their relative weight, and this has
been very well done in several British Association Reports, some of which

are nearly as old as the British Association.

     ' There are some branches of science whose position with respect to
the public, or else to the educational interest, is such that treatises or
text-books can be published on commercial principles, either as books to
be read by the free public, or to be got up by the school public.

     ' There is little encouragement, however, for a scientific man to write
a treatise so long as he can, with much less trouble, produce an original
memoir, which will be much more readily received by a learned society

than the treatise would have been by a publisher.
     ' The systematisation of science is therefore carried on under difficulties

when left to itself ; and I think that the experience of the British Asso-
ciation warrants the belief that its action in asking men of science to
furnish reports has conferred benefits on science which would not other-

wise have accrued to it.

     ' There are so many valuable reports in the published volumes that I

shall indicate only a few, the selection being founded on the direction of

my own work rather than on any less arbitrary principle.

     ' First, when a branch of science contains abstruse calculations as well
as interesting experiments, it is desirable that those who cultivate the

experimental side should be conscious that certain things have been done
by the mathematicians. The matter to be reported on in this case is not

voluminous, but it is hard reading, and those who are not experts require

a guide.
     ' Thus, Professor Challis in 1834 gave a most useful report on the

mathematical investigations by Young, Laplace, Poisson, and Gauss on
Capillary Attraction, and Professor Stokes in 1862 reports on Theories-
of Double Refraction. This report may, indeed, be accepted as an instal-
ment of the treatises which, if the desire of the scientific world were law,
Professor Stokes would long ago have written. It is meant, no doubt, as
a guide to other men's writings, but it is intelligible in itself without
reference to those writings. Such a report is a full justification of the
existence of the British Association, if it had done nothing else.

     ' Another type of report is that of Professor Cayley on Dynamics
(1857 and 1862). This seems intended rather as a guide in reading the
original authors than as a self-interpreting document, though, of course,

besides the criticism and the methodical arrangement, there is much

original light thrown on the mass of memoirs discussed in it. It will be

many years before the value of this report will be superseded by treatises.
     ' The Report of the Committee on Mathematical Tables deals with a

subject which, though not so abstruse, is larger and drier than any of the
preceding. It is, however, a most interesting as well as valuable report,
and supplies information which would never have been printed unless the
British Association had asked for the report, and which never would
have been obtained if the author of the report had not been available.

      ' There are several other reports which are not mere reports, but

rather original papers preceded by a historical sketch of the subject. No

special encouragement is needed to get people to write reports of this

kind.'

      Professor Stokes thus expresses himself on the subject :

     ' It seems to me that reports on the progress of science may be of
ON THE PROGRESS OF MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.  39

two kinds, with somewhat different objects in view ; and in considering

the best mode of meeting these objects it may be well to keep the

distinction in view.

     ' First, there is a report, the object of which is to prepare a sort ot
repertorium of what has been done in a particular branch of science since
the date of the last report of similar character in the same branch of

    A1 report of this kind should present the reader with a brief account

of the leading aim and chief results of the various memoirs which have
been published within the time on the branch of science to which it
relates ; the writer should not be expected to criticise the memoirs, except
in plain instances of errors or imperfections, but the responsibility of
sifting the wheat from the chaff should in the main be left to the

reader.

     ' Secondly, there are reports of a more comprehensive and far more
critical character. These should be made at wider intervals, should take

a more comprehensive view of the subject, and should be highly critical,
sifting out the substantial acquisitions that had been made to the branch

of science to which they refer.
     ' Each kind of reports are of value, though in somewhat different

ways. The first aids the individual in keeping himself up to the progress
of science around him,--a progress in which from his position he may be
expected to take part and to exercise influence. They lighten to him the
labour of search, but teach him to exercise his own discrimination.

     ' The second should be a material aid to the student in making himself
master of what was really of value, and help him to avoid wasting his
time on what was of little importance, and aid him in judging of the

relative importance of different lines of research.

     1 Reports of the first kind may be much promoted by the work of

committees. The division of labour lightens the task, and the feeling of

co-operation carries a man through labour which otherwise, as the man is

likely to have a good deal else to do, he might hesitate to undertake.
     ' Reports of the second kind eminently demand the hand of a master,

and the hand of a master is not always free. I doubt much if the
appointment of committees would aid much in the preparation of good

reports of this class, and unless reports are thoroughly good they are
better, perhaps, not attempted. I do not see what is to be done except

to work a good man when you can get him.'

     It is evident that the distinction here pointed out by Professor Stokes
has an important bearing on the question of the reappointment of the
Committee. The work required for the production of reports intended
simply as systematic records ' of the leading aim and chief results ' of

published investigations, would be merely that of careful compilation. It

would not only be possible to divide work of this kind among a con-
siderable number of contributors, but to get it done at all such division

of labour would be necessary, and accordingly reports of this class could

only be furnished by committees. On the other hand, a report which is

of the nature of a critical survey of the condition of knowledge in any
branch of science, and is intended to indicate the relative value of different
investigations, requires to possess a unity of plan and thought which can

 only result from its being the work of an individual author possessing
 a complete mastery of his subject. In such a case the function of the
 committee would be confined to the suggestion of the subject and to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

--requesting some qualified person to report upon it a function which

hitherto has been discharged by the Sectional Committees of the Asso-

ciation.

     Considering all the difficulties of the undertaking and the extent to
which it is rendered unnecessary by existing (chiefly German) publica-
tions, the present Committee came to the conclusion that it is not at
present desirable for the Association to attempt to obtain reports in the
nature of compilations of abstracts of the papers published upon
mathematics or physics.

     With regard to the other more critical class of reports, many have
already been obtained which are recognised as among the most valuable

results of the existence of the British Association ; and the Committee
hope for a continuance of these valuable contributions. They are happy
to state that two such reports have already been promised. Professor
Stokes has undertaken to draw up the plan of a report on physical

optics, especially in reference to the theory of reflection, the theory of

dispersion, and the theory of phosphorescence and fluorescence. Pro-
fessor Balfour Stewart has also undertaken, in conjunction with Mr. J.
Allan Brown, to draw up the heads of a report on terrestrial magnetism.

Dr. Stapfp has forwarded to the Secretary a summary of his observa-
tions of temperature made in the St. Gothard Tunnel in 1878, in con-

tinuation of those of previous years, the places of observation being

always those which have been newly opened up. At the Swiss end the

portion reported on begins at 5000 and ends at 6400 metres from the

north portal                                                        and at the Italian end  the limits are  4600 and 5900 metres

The mean rate of increase downwards in the whole length of the

tunnel is '02068 of a degree Centigrade per metre of depth, measured

from the surface directly over. This is 1°F. for 88 feet. Where the sur-

face is a steep ridge, the increase is less rapid than this average ; where

the surface is a valley or plain, the increase is more rapid.

The boring in connection with the Liverpool "Waterworks at Bootle,

which was described in last year's Report as having attained a depth of.
1004 feet with a temperature of 58T, was completed in December, the
depth being 1302 feet, and the temperature at the bottom 59 - 0. The
boring ceased for six weeks at the depth of 1004 feet, and the temperature
fell during this interval from 58T to 57'0. The slowness of the increase

downwards, and the lowness of the temperature at the bottom, are very

remarkable. Mr. Symons found a temperature of 70 at the depth of

only 1100 feet in the Kentish Town Well, near London ; and Mr. Atkinson

found a temperature of 70 at 1366 feet in the boring at South Hetton

AColliery, Durham.  comparison of the temperature 59"0 at 1302 feet

at Bootle with the temperature 52 - at 226 feet gives an increase of only

7° in 1076 feet, or 1° for 154 feet.

     Mr. E. Wethered, F.G.S., F.C.S., has taken during the past year a
valuable series of observations at the Kingswood Collieries, near Bristol.
The instrument employed was one of the Committee's slow-acting
thermometers, which was inserted in holes two feet deep, bored in newly

exposed coal or rock, special care being taken to avoid currents of air.

As there is no explosive gas in these collieries, powerful ventilation is not
necessary ; and the headings in which the observations were made were
ventilated by means of a square wooden pipe (called a trunk) lying on
the floor, and serving for the exit of the air, while the entering air flows
above and beside it. This trunk was always drawn some distance back
from the end of the heading where the thermometer was inserted.

     As soon as the hole for the thermometer had been bored, it was closed
with clay rolled in the form of a plug, 6 inches long with a head, and the
thermometer was inserted about an hour afterwards, the mouth being

again closed as before. The holes were in most cases dry.
     The strata in which the observations were taken belong to the lowest
                                                                                           ;

of the three divisions of the Bristol coal-field, and their dip, where not

faulted or disturbed, is about one in six.

     The depths of the places of observation were determined by Mr.
Munro, teacher of mining and surveying in the Bristol Mining School,
and the surface-temperature is assumed to be identical with the mean

temperature of the air for the last fifteen years at Clifton (3 miles distant),

according to the observations of Dr. Burden, which is 48*7. The surface

of the ground at the centre of the collieries is 24 feet higher than Dr.

Burden's observatory, and is 216 feet above sea level.
     The first place of observation was in an exploring drift driven at a

high angle. The thermometer was placed in a hole in hard ' duns ' for
one week, and showed a temperature of 55 - 7. The depth was 441 feet,
and the hole partially filled with water from natural causes. The ther-
mometer was replaced, and after the lapse of another week the same

temperature was again found.

The thermometer was next placed in a hard arenaceous stone yielding

a considerable quantity of water, at practically the same depth as the

last observation, and in the same drift. It gave a temperature 55*4.

Under the stone, and resting upon the duns, was a seam of coal

averaging about 1 foot 6 inches thick, into which the thermometer was

next inserted, and 57'2 was read at the end of another week. Illness

prevented Mr. Wethered from making a re- examination to ascertain the

causes of the discrepancies here exhibited, and he therefore proposes to

reject these first observations.

    On the abandonment of the drift just referred to, the thermometer

Awas removed to a cross-measure branch, driven almost on a level.

week or two before, a seam of coal about 2 feet thick had been cut in

this branch, and a level was now being driven on it. On Saturday,

June 15, a hole was bored, at the head of the level, in the coal, and the

thermometer inserted at 2 p.m., just as the men w£re leaving work. On

Monday the temperature 54" 7 was read. As the pit was idle on this day,

the thermometer was replaced, and after 12 hours gave the same reading.
The hole was perfectly dry, with the exception of what miners call

' sweating.'

    On Saturday, June 23, the thermometer was placed in a hard blue

duns at the head of the cross-measure branch, 10 feet away from the last
hole ; and on Monday the temperature 54" 7 was taken, the same as in
the coal. The pit being again idle, the observation was repeated, with a

confirmatory result. The depth in each case was 402 feet.

The next observation was in the deepest workings of the collieries,

Ain what is known as the Deep Pit colliery.          branch was being driven

for the purpose of cutting off an extent of road in the Great Seam workings

accordingly on Saturday, June 29, the thermometer was placed, in the

usual way, at  the  head of the branch  in  a  blue  duns                           depth  1767 feet.
                                                                                 ;

On the Monday, 74' 7 was read, and this temperature was confirmed by an

observation from the following Saturday to Monday.

     The next observation was made at a higher level in the same pit, in

the Great Vein workings, depth 1367 feet. On Saturday, July 13, a hole

was bored in the same bed of duns as in the last observation, and on

the following Monday, 68"5 was read.

   On Saturday, July 20, the thermometer was placed in the Great Seam

coal, which rests upon the duns, and after the lapse of the usual time 67 - 5

was read.
       ON THE KATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 43

    On Saturday, July 27, by a mistake, the hole was bored in the duns

20 feet behind the coal. This point had been exposed for a week or two,
and the temperature indicated, 69'2, is therefore rejected by Mr. Wethered.

    On Saturday, August 3, another hole was bored in the coal, and gave
on Monday the same temperature, 68 - 5, which had been observed in the

first hole in the duns. Another hole in the duns gave, a week later, the
same temperature, 68 - 5. Mr. Wethered adopts this as the true tempera-

ture at the depth in question (1367 feet).

     The thermometer was now removed to the Speedwell pit, the shaft of
which is distant about half a mile from the Deep pit, and observations
were commenced in a cross-measure branch, which shortly afterwards

cut the Two-feet seam of coal.

    On Saturday, August 17, the thermometer was inserted in a hard
arenaceous stone, and on Monday the temperature 69 · 7 was read, depth

1439 feet. This reading was confirmed from the following Saturday to
Monday.

    On Saturday, October 12, the Two-feet seam of coal having been cut,
the thermometer was inserted in it, and on Monday gave a temperature

of 69 - 7, the same as in the stone further back in the branch in August.
The depth was the same within 2 feet.

    On Saturday, October 26, a hole was bored in the duns under the

Two-feet coal, which again gave 69'7.

     The next observation was made in the Great Seam coal of the Speed-
well pit, in an advanced level head, opening out new ground, depth 1232
feet. The thermometer was placed in a hole bored in the coal on Saturday,
November 2, and on Monday the temperature was 667. The same
reading was obtained the following week in the duns under the coal.

    This was the last of the observations deemed reliable. Two other

observations were made, the first in ground from under which coal had
been worked, and the second in strata disturbed by faults, but in neither
case could reliable results be obtained.

     The following is a summary of the temperatures, arranged in order of

depth, omitting those which are doubtful.

different parts of a colliery. Comparing the surface with the lowest

depth, we have an increase of 26o- in 1769 feet, which is at the rate of

1° in 68 feet ; and comparing the depth of 402 feet with the lowest depth,

we have an increase of 20o- in 1367 feet, which is at the rate of l o- for

68-35 feet.

--44 report 1879.

     The observations appear to have been taken in very favourable circum-
stances, and with much care and judgment. Being the only observations
yet furnished to the Committee from the West of England, they form a

very valuable contribution to our knowledge.

     Mr. Symons has continued his observations at the depth of 1000 feet
in the Kentish Town Well (see Report for 1876, p. 209). During 1877

little was done except to continue the record of the temperature of the
well-room, have the roof repaired, and make experiments with respect to

the elongation of wires of various kinds. In accordance with a suggestion

of Sir William Thomson, a new copper wire, No. 22, was purchased,
and the Phillips's maximum thermometer, No. 14,608, of which each
degree Fahr. is 0"4 inch in length, was lowered to 1000 feet on January 10,
1878. The first noticeable feature, and a very unsatisfactory one, was, that

on March 5, 1878, a little mud was found in the protecting case. It will

be remembered that the tube was originally 1302 feet deep, but that on
the first attempt to lower the thermometer to 1100 feet in May, 1868, the
cord was found to become slack at depths varying from 1070 to 1085

feet. It seems probable that the mud has now risen to 1000 feet. Its

extreme softness has been illustrated more than once by the fall of
thermometers into it, sometimes from a great height. They have never
been broken, nor even had their indices displaced. The new wire stretched
more than the old one, but after the first two months the elongation was
remarkably uniform. The thermometer having been many years in use,
it was thought desirable to reverify it, and on September 20, 1878, it was

sent to Kew Observatory for this purpose. Another thermometer was

temporarily substituted for it, which was only divided to whole degrees
and was read by estimation to tenths. With this thermometer the
following observations were taken :

     The wire broke on January 2, 1879, and up to the present time no
serious attempt has been made to recover the thermometer, but this has

arisen rather from want of leisure than from any difficulty in the

operation.

The results given in the following table (which goes back to the

beginning of the observations), have all been obtained with one and the

same thermometer.

The index error of the thermometer has been determined several times,

.as follows :

               1872, August, by Mr. Symons,           error under + -0 1

               1873, November, by Professor E. J. Mills  error + -34

               1878, December, by Kew Observers

The gradual rise of zero here indicated is in accordance with usual

experience ; and the index errors at intermediate dates have been derived
from these by graphical interpolation, that is by drawing a curve in which
horizontal distance represents time and vertical distance amount of index
error, the curve being drawn so as to pass through the four points
determined by the above observations, and being made as smooth as
possible. The stretching of the wire is determined by the readings of the
        ON THE RATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 45

recording apparatus described in the 1869 Report, and the correction to
reduce from the actual depth to the depth of 1000 feet is made by-
allowing -018 of a degree per foot, this being the mean rate of increase
found by observation (see Report for 1871). The above table shows that
the entire range of the corrected temperatures at 1000 feet is less than
half a degree, and that the departure from the mean exceeds a tenth of
a degree on only seven occasions out of twenty-nine. Mr. Symons has
directed close attention to those readings which differ most from the

       Date of Raising

every 100 feet of depth during the sinking of a shaft, probably to the

depth of about 4500 feet, in one of the mines of the Comstock lode in

Nevada. Two others have been supplied on similar terms to the

Meteorological Office.

With the view of carrying out the resolution, expressed in last year's

Report, to commence thermo-electric observations in filled bores, the

Secretary has procured from Messrs. Siemens 500 feet of No. 20 copper

wire, and the same length of No. 19 soft charcoal iron wire, both of them

well insulated with gutta-percha, and has conducted some thermo-electric

experiments with  them  in  the Laboratory                                                                      but  the apparatus is not yet

ready for actual use.

Mr. Lebour has improved the form of plug devised by him (on the

umbrella principle) mentioned in previous Reports (1876, p. 209, and

1877, p. 199). The apparatus now requires only one wire, and remains

collapsed so long as the wire is taut, but opens out and plugs the hole

when it becomes slack.

     The following corrections are to be made in last year's Report.
     In the acount of Dr. Stapff's thermometers, ' steel cap ' and ' steel
jacket,' should be ' brass cap ' and ' brass jacket.'
     At a later place in the extract from Dr. Stapff's paper, · wet bore-

holes with standing water,' should be ' wet bore-holes with running

water.'

     In the references to papers, in foot-note, ' 1878, 1876, and 1877,'
should be ' 1875, 1876, and 1877.'

                                            and Sixth Millions.

     During the year the calculation has been carried on without inter-
mission under the direction of Mr. James Glaisher. At present the
factor table for the fourth million is printed and stereotyped, and will be
published immediately ; the manuscript of the fifth million is complete

course of being entered.

     The mode of construction was described in last year's repoi't (Dublin,
1878, pp. 172-178), and a more complete account will appear in the

introduction to the factor table for the fourth million.

         Results of an Enumeration of the Primes in the Fourth Million.

    Two independent enumerations of the primes in the fourth million

were made, one from the manuscript before it was sent to the printer, and
the other by a different computer from the proof sheets. The results are
shown in the following table :

been published in the ' Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical

Society,' vol. iii. pp. 20-23, 54-56 (1877).

    It may be remarked that in the first million there is no century con-

sisting wholly of composite numbers, in the second there is one, in the

third one, in the fourth two, in the seventh six, in the eighth four, and in

the ninth four.

It will be seen from the above table that no century in the fourth

million contains more than fourteen primes, and that only four contain

this number. In the third million, however, there is one century con-

taining as many as seventeen primes, one containing fifteen, and no less

than six containing fourteen                                                                                                                              in  the seventh million there are three con-

taining fourteen primes, in the eighth million two containing fourteen, as
well as two containing fifteen, and in the ninth million two containing

fourteen.

The next table shows the number of primes in each successive group

of ten thousand between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000. Thus, for example,

between 3,000,000 and 3,010,000 there are 670 primes; between 3,010,000
and 3,020,000 there are 659, . . . ; between 3,100,000 and 3,110,000 there
are 676, and so on. The numbers in the lowest line of the table are ob-
tained by adding the numbers in each column, and agree, of course, with

the numbers at the foot of the columns in the previous table.

mathematics (in reference to the attraction of spheroids and other physical

theories  l   ;  but they first occur in the theory of interpolation :    see Gauss,

In the new theory of Gauss, it is shown that it is advantageous to take

the given values of x not at equal intervals, but to be the values which

tbe decimal values terminate, and in tbe following tables tbe complete

values are given. Two independent calculations were made, one by Mr.

Barrett Davis, and tbe other under tbe supervision of the reporter, by

whom they were compared, corrected, and differenced. As the values

in the tables are complete, the second, third,... seventh differences in the

respective functions were absolutely constant, and thus afforded an exact

verification. The calculations were performed seven years ago, and are

referred to in tbe Report for 1873, p. 170 ; the tables were not published,
however, as about that time the issue of a separate volume containing

these and some other tables which it was proposed to calculate was con-

templated by tbe Committee.

Sixth Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor A. S. Hebschel,
   Jf.il., F.R.A.S., Professor G. A. Leboue, F.Q.8., and Mr. J. T.
   Dunn, B.Sc, on Experiments to determine the Thermal Con-
    ductivities of certain Rocks, showing especially the Geological

    Aspects of the Investigation.

The research and correspondence necessary for the completion of an
historical sketch of the attempts hitherto made to determine experimentally
the Thermal Conductivities of various Rocks occurring widely over the

earth's surface, which the Committee proposed to prepare during the past
year, are not so far advanced at present as to allow them to be compre-
hended in this year's Report. The Committee hopes, by continuing its
enquiries for another year, with the addition to its numbers of Professors

W. E. Ayrton and J. Perry, of the Imperial College of Engineering in Japan,

who have pursued the subject practically with the greatest attention and

success, to carry out the object of their undertaking, so as to exhibit the
present state of our knowledge of the data of Thermal Conductivity,
needful for discussions of the conditions of the earth's temperature, which
have been determined by observations and experiments.

      In a paper of great practical interest in this respect, 1 published at the
end of the year 1876, by Professor Stefan, of Vienna, a series of experi-
ments is described, by which he determined very accurately the absolute
thermal conductivity of ordinary Ebonite. The process used being the
same in principle (although differing from it a little in its details) , as that
adopted by Professors Ayrton and Perry for determining the thermal
conductivity of some specimens of a kind of Japanese building-stone,
employs for its application Fourier's formulas, and therefore gives the
absolute conductivity, in the first instance, indirectly, or only in terms of
the heat-capacity of a cubic centimetre of the trial-substance as the unit
of heat- quantity, instead of in absolute heat-units. The value in absolute
heat-units of this thermal capacity of the substance has then to be deter-

mined by a subsidiary experiment. As the very trustworthy value found
by this otherwise convenient method affords a useful standard for com-
parison with other methods, that adopted by the Committee was checked,
during the past year, by applying it to determine directly the thermal
conductivity of a plate of ordinary ebonite, together with that of some
plates of vulcanised indiarubber, with which, by the courtesy of their

agent in Newcastle, Mr. W. Beer, the Committee was furnished from the

Silvertown Works of the Indiarubber and Guttapercha Company in

London.

     Some omitted measurements of rock conductivities were also made at
the close of the past year, with the Committee's apparatus. But owing
to some deterioration which it has in the meantime undergone in its con-
dition, they are insufficiently high, as proved by the values found for red
serpentine and white Sicilian marble. As the results, however, possess a
relative value among themselves, and also in relation to these two speci-
mens of which the conductivities have before been very well determined,

they are added to the last- mentioned observations, in the accompanying

     1 ' Sitzungsberichte ' of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Vienna, vol. for
 1876, part ii. ; November, 1876.

Table, with the probable values which they may be conjectured to indicate
very nearly as concluded from comparisons of the known with the defec-

tively observed conductivities of the twb rock-plates of reference.
      The uncertainty which attached, in last year's Report, to the obser-

vations of the specific heats of some porous rocks, has now been removed

by repeating the experiment of boiling them in water, and immediately
 weighing them to determine the quantity of boiling-hot water which they
absorbed. The result is that the assumption made in last year's Report
that the quantity of water so imbibed is in general half the weight which
they are found to have gained by an immediate immersion, after boiling,
in cold water, is fully verified. The fraction of the total water-gain which,

for example, entered the six specimens of Craigleith sandstone during the
first process of boiling them, had the real values 0'41-0"49 (average 0"45).
The corrections which the specific heats of these porous sandstones given
in the Table of last year's Report require for this little imperfection of the

adopted allowance is so small as only to affect by a single significant unit

(and in the ratio - by one or two units), a few of the thirty numbers

                                         c

given for these sandstones in the Table. The same substantiation of the
figures in the Table has been found for all the sandstones (water-absorp-
tion 6 - l-8 - 4 per cent.), and other rocks (including Mansfeld limestone,
absorption 8"1 per cent.), not exceeding them in porosity. Newcastle
firebrick (absorption 14 - 3 per cent.) is an extreme case in which the

allowance adopted, and the values of the specific heats, and of the ratio, -

given in the Table require no sensible correction. In rocks which, like
the last, exceed the pure sandstones in porosity, the rule for correcting
the Table illustrated by examples in the last Report, to regard the allow-

ance adopted in the Table as too little by a half, is now proved to be sub-

stantially correct, the ratios for Caenstone, Great Pyramid, and Castle
Eden limestones, Godstone chalk, 1 firestone, and sandstone, magnesite,

and plaster-of-Paris, all lying between 074 and 0*85, the last of which
ratios is an exceptionally high proportion, for Castle Eden limestone.

    On correcting the tabular specific heats of these very porous rocks (as

has been done in the short recapitulation of them given below, in the
manner described by some examples in last year's Report), by the actual
fractions of total water-gain now found to have been introduced into the
plates by boiling them, a close agreement of the corrected values (with

only one exception) is produced with the common value, about 0"20, of

the heat- capacities of nearly all the other rocks recorded in the Table.

The real specific heat, by weight of plaster-of-Paris alone, agrees (as was
surmised correctly in last year's Report) with that of English alabaster,
or gypsum, and nearly also with red and green serpentine from Cornwall,
in being exceptionally high (026-028). If the metallic ores, galena and
iron pyrites, are excluded from the list, the only other examples of rocks
in the Table, whose specific heats differ by more than one or two significant

units from the common value, - 20, are the specimens of Newcastle black

shale (0"29), and coal of two varieties, cannel coal, and ordinary pit-coal,

     1 The specimen of pure white chalk, whose thermal properties, as partly tested,
have been previously described in these Keports, having yielded and crumbled last
year in the experiment on its specific heat, could not be submitted this year to a
repetition of the same experiment.

which have the extreme specific heats by weight, 029 and 037. The

present well-measured specific heat of pnmice stone (024, unless the plate

contained a considerable quantity of hygroscopic moisture) , is also appre-

ciably above the common value to which the heat-capacities of nearly all

the different descriptions of rocks tested approximate very closely in the

Table.

To the above-proved rule of partial water-absorption by boiling, among

the very porous rocks, the plate of pumice stone presented an exception.

While absorbing a fifth of a pound (75 - 6 per cent, of its weight) of water
by boiling and immediate immersion in cold water, which far surpasses

the observed porosity of any other porous kind of rock examined, only

three-quarters of an ounce, or 021 of the former quantity, enters the

plate, and occupies its pores during the process of boiling only. 1 The

fraction of half the total water gain, provisionally assumed in the Table to

be introduced into the porous rocks by boiling, is therefore here too great,

instead of too little, by about a half of its amount. The large uncertainty,

until this plate's water-absorption could be re-observed, led to the omis-

sion, in the Table of last year's Report, of the data found for pumice stone,

the real values of which are now given in the subjoined list of verified

determinations.

In the hope of discovering an explanation of the wide difference which

exists between the various conductivities hitherto recorded in these

Reports, and a list of similar conductivities published in the Proceedings

of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1873 (vol. viii., p. 66), by Professor
G. Forbes (the values in which are not more than a fourth or a fifth of those

described in these Reports), the Committee requested Professor Forbes to

search for possible errors among the numbers used as constant factors in

his calculations, while it submitted its own reductions to a similar ex-

amination. The result of Professor Forbes's re-examination is not yet

received                                        but the  Committee has had the annoyance to find that one  such
                                             ;

small error has unsuspectedly been committed in its own determinations.

Among the factors used, since the outset of its experiments, to convert

into terms of absolute conductivity the rate of heat- flow measured directly

in the 5-inch plates, a number, 196, was used inadvertently in place of

the correct multiplier, 220, to effect a portion of the transformation. All

the observed values that have hitherto been described in these Reports as

obtained from year to year of the absolute conductivities (k), and of the

     &·

ratio - of the various rock-specimens which have been tested are there-

    1 Equally irregular departures from perfect conformity to a common rule occur

in some examples of the less porous kinds of rocks, where the yery moderate absorp-
tion of water, however, renders the deviations of their properties of little sensible

influence, as affecting the provisionally assigned values of their specific heats so as

to make them needful of any appreciable corrections. The hot-water absorption by
gas coke is like that of pumice stone, but a quarter, instead of a half or three-

quarters of its total water gain, which in this slightly porous substance is only 2-9
per cent, by weight. The small correction which this entails on the specific heat
by weight (0193), as given in the Table, is the additional quantity 00073, making
the real specific heat from the experiments, 02003. This is even more nearly iden-
tical with the value, -201, for coke of anthracite, given by Eegnault, than the
former provisional value was, the near agreement of which with Kegnault's deter-
mination was pointed out in the comparative Table of such observations in last

year's Report.

fore deficient in their recorded values by an eighth part of their assigned
magnitudes. While requiring this addition of an eighth part to their
magnitudes, the absolute resistances given as the practical results of the
experiments, require, to correct them for the same source of error, to be
diminished by a ninth part of their stated values. Examples of the
needful corrections which will suffice to remove the misconstructions
introduced by this entirely unsuspected error of reduction, are given in
the last three columns of the accompanying short Table of amended data.

columns are increased, for correctness, in these new columns by an eighth

part ; while in the same columns the absolute resistances given in the former
columns are diminished by a ninth part of their values. The Committee
desires to submit this easy process of correction as an immediately neces-
sary treatment of all the experimental results of absolute thermal conduc-
tivities and resistances at which it has arrived, and which have hitherto
been published in the pages and Tables of these Reports, before the present
year, for their proper emendation. It will then be found by comparisons,
to which the Committee hopes to revert particularly in another year, that
a somewhat closer agreement than was exhibited in last year's Report does
actually exist between its corrected determinations and those sure, indu-
bitable data of rates of thermal conductivity in certain terrestrial rocks
which able and elaborate reductions of several extensive series of obser-

vations of underground thermometers have made known. A valuable

store of new materials, it may be noticed, for these last investigations was

furnished by the publication last year, in the volume of ' Greenwich Meteoro-

logical Reductions, chiefly for the years 1847-73,' of the continuous records
during this interval of twenty-seven years, of the deep-sunk underground
thermometers in the grounds of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich
only the first half of which valuable results have yet been utilised (by
Professor Everett) for deducing the constant of thermal conductivity of

the great eminence of gravel strata upon which the Observatory is

placed.

limestone and marble specimens of the list. When corrected for the known weight of

water which it absorbed in boiling, the specific heat by weight of Magnesite observed last

year becomes 0-175 ; lower than that of limestone, instead of higher as should be expected

from this rock's lighter molecular weight. The real value now found of its specific heat is the

with their molecular weights, this high specific heat of magnesite appears to be quite in

accordance with the low place which it occupies among those carbonates in its combining

at all, and there is then shown positive electricity of very moderate

intensity.

     The electricity, however, rises very rapidly, and comes to a maximum
at about half-past eleven o'clock, and seems to correspond very much

--with the flow of the sea breeze which the sun shining on the land causes
--with great regularity and also with the accumulation of masses of cloud

or watery vapour, which rise and coalesce to form a thin screen daring
the hottest part of the day over the basin of Funchal.

      It is curious that the index of the electrometer, which is extremely

--unsteady and oscillating whilst the electricity is rising probably from

the influence of masses of variously electrified vapour or air in motion

--becomes steady, and remains fairly steady for two hours or more during

which time the maximum is maintained. The electricity then subsides,

as the cloud-screen breaks up early in the afternoon, at first suddenly, and
then very gradually until evening, when it faintly begins to rise again.

     The formation of the thin above cloud-layer over Funchal is very
regular, and occupies a vertical space of about 200 feet, at an altitude of
2,500 feet, varying slightly with temperature and atmospheric pressure,
and appearing, from a distance at sea, as a thin white sheet, beyond which
the black rocky peaks of the island shoot up for several thousand feet.

     The electricity below this cloud is always positive and moderately
intense ; in the cloud itself it is still positive, though feeble ; and above
the cloud, in a sheltered situation where these observations were taken, it
is still positive, though still more feeble, and very irregular.

     In warmer weather, as regards this cloud, the same conditions exist
exactly, although the moisture forming the cloud does not condense, but
appears from above as a dense blue transparent haze, liable, however, to
become opaque on any accidental puff of colder air.

    In my own garden I found that every observation was mitigated or

quite vitiated by the numbers of lofty trees closely planted together.
     The currents of air constituting the daily sea-breeze of Madeira are of

no great depth, perhaps 70 or 80 feet, and above the true wind blows in

the contrary direction.
      I have often succeeded in flying a kite through the sea-breeze into

the upper wind, and have made some attempts, abortive for want of proper
insulation, to bring down the electricity of the upper current.

     The electricity, however, of this upper current, which in fine settled
weather is the north-east trade wind, can easily be observed on exposed
mountain ridges, and always gives a steadily moderate indication of a

positive quality. Indeed, the only observations of the north-east trade
ever thought to have given a negative result were taken on a lesser peak
of Teneriffe with inferior instruments by Mr. Smyth, who, however,
attaches little value to them.

    For my own part I have not had a single observation of negative
electricity in the atmosphere at any time, if I may exclude faint oscilla-

tions of the needle, when there has been no ponderable quantity either way.

     In Madeira, at the termination of a long period of fine weather, on
the approach of rain clouds I have noticed a high electricity of a positive
character, very transient and irregular in character, and falling very low

when it actually rained. Rising electricity on the cessation of rain is

here, as in all other places, an important factor in forecasting weather.

     But Madeira is occasionally subject, especially in summer weather, to
another wind of very peculiar character. This is a kind of Sirocco, called
             ON ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY AT MADEIRA.                    65

in Portuguese ' l'Este,' which blows with great force, striking in its in-

tegrity in a curious manner certain districts alone.

The wind appears to be generated in the sandy tract of the Great

Sahara, and also perhaps beyond in districts extending far into Asia.

The heated air of those burning plains ascends tumultuously and pursues

a course more or less easterly across the Atlantic. Far above the surface

of the water it can imbibe no moisture, and after its descent has become

possible by a partial loss of heat it strikes upon the surface of Madeira,

depositing sand, locusts, birds, and other evidence of its distant origin, and

for a while the mid-day climate of the Great Desert is felt 400 miles away

from Africa, in the middle of the Atlantic. The dryness of this wind is

wonderful ; it will, in its greedy power of evaporation, separate the dry

and wet bulbs of Mason's hygrometer 25° or more, and in a temperature

of 80 F. the dew-point is below the freezing point. All clouds disappear,

and the sun shines hazily in a sky which exchanges its ordinary deep blue

for a semi-transparent colour of light grey.

The electrical quality of this wind is simply a blank. I have been

unable during four favourable opportunities for observing it to detect any

registerable amount, either positive or negative ; but I can see under a

high magnifying power an irregular swaying to and fro of the needle

similar in chai-acter to those given by a broken submerged cable. Pro-

bably at its origin, and especially if it takes up much sand, the wind is

resinously charged ; but it will be interesting to determine whether an

intensely dry wind can be strongly electrified or electrified at all.

In the neighbourhood of strong l'Este winds I have also made a few

observations on some curiously rounded clouds which hang with singular

immobility over deep mountain gorges, although tossed and tumbled by

strong wind on their upper surfaces.

I have some evidence to show that both their power and quietness

relate to their somewhat high electrical charge, and it is probable that we

shall find by-and-by in a more general way that the form of clouds de-
pends very much on the influence of neighbouring electrified masses, in a

manner nearly related to the experiments of Lord Rayleigh on fountain-

jets. But these cloud observations are both difficult and somewhat

dangerous. If any one should be tempted to fly a kite with a wet cord

and a metallic conductor in its tail down into one of these mountain

clouds, he should place his electrometer upon the ground or else have a

long trailing copper chain attached to the brasswork. The umbrella, too,
must be kept low. If these precautions are neglected a very painful

shock will probably be felt, which may cause the observer to drop the

instrument.

The very meagreness of this Report is enough to show the necessity

for multiplying electrometric observations. I would only ask, Has the

electrometer yet any share in determining our weather forecasts, or is elec-

tricity thought of in the relations of meteorology to the public health ?

I fear not.

    The fascinating little instrument is my constant companion and the

solace of many a leisure moment. It has been taken to the north and

south of this country, and has twice crossed the Atlantic with me. In-

deed, it never failed to answer every question certainly and sensitively

until I attempted last Sunday to take it to St. Paul's in London to take

an observation under the dome. Then the pumice-stone broke, and poured

its corrosive fluid upon the brasswork.

     I can only regret that so little help is to be got from the text-books
on electricity in these observations. They appear to devote most of their
space given to atmospheric electricity to a picture of Franklin holding a
kite under a shed, and another picture of a waterspout.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sylvester, F.R.S.,

   and Professor Caylet, F.R.S., appointed for the purpose of
   calculating Tables of the Fundamental Invariants of Algebraic

    Forms.

With a portion of the grant made last year, the valuable services of

Mr. F. Franklin, of the Johns Hopkins University, have been obtained
to aid in computing, under Professor Sylvester's inspection, the ground
forms (otherwise called the fundamental invariants and covai'iants) of
binary quantics of the 7th, 8th, and 10th orders respectively, thus ren-
dering the list of tables of such forms complete for quantics of all
orders up to the 10th inclusive.

     The sbeets containing the calculations referred to are deposited pro-
visionally in the Library of the Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore,
where they remain subject to the direction of the Council of the British

Association as to their future disposal.

     The tables of the ground forms of the seventhic are published in the
Comptes Bendus of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, 1878 ; the table of the
ground forms of the ninethic in the ' American Journal of Mathematics,
March, 1879, and in a future number of that Journal will shortly also
appear the intermediary tables of the Generating Functions from which
such ground forms are deduced, as also the ground forms and generating

functions connected with the tenthic.
      These tables, in addition to those previously constructed, will, it is

believed, form a valuable, and (for the present) a sufficient basis for the
prosecution of this kind of research in what regards the theory of single
binary quantics, leaving a wide field still open for computations of a
similar nature connected with systems of binary quantics and ternary and
quaternary quantics, single or in systems.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Eev. Samuel Haughton,.
    M.D., and Benjamin Williamson, M. A., appointed for the Cal-

   culation of Sun-Heat Coefficients. Drawn up by Dr. Haughton.

The calculation of the quantity of sun-heat received at a given place,
and in a given time, on the earth's surface, neglecting the heat absorbed
by the atmosphere, was solved by Lambert in the middle of the last
century, and the researches of Poisson, Meech, and others have added
very little to the work done by Lambert.

      I have myself published a simple solution of Lambert's problem,

depending on trigonometrical series, well known and readily applied, 1
copies of which are now offered to Section A.

    When the absorption of heat by the atmosphere is neglected we have

merely to integrate

                     A/cos z dh                                                                          (1)

from suurise to snnset, where

                  A = the solar constant of radiation,
                   =z sun's zenith distance,
                   =h sun's hour angle

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

an integration readily performed ; and then sum the results from day to
day, from the summer to the winter solstice ; a summation which presents

no serious difficulty.

    But when we attempt to compute the sun-heat received in a given
time and at a given latitude, allowing for the absorption of sun-heat by
the atmosphere, we are met by formidable mathematical difficulties

which have never yet been seriously acknowledged and attacked.

    It is, in fact, easy to see that we must now attempt the integration,

daily, from sunrise to sunset, of

                     A.jp u cos z dh,                                                                    (2)

instead of

                     A /cos z dh,

where          =p the atmospheric constant of absorption

               = --+u «y 2rh h2 -f r2 cos2 z                                                          ;

                                              r cos z
                                                                                  ;
               =h height of homogeneous atmosphere
               =r radius of earth.                                                                 ;

    It is evident at sight that equation (2) is not integrable ; and if we
attempt to integrate it by series we fail completely, for the following
reason :--

     It will be seen, on trial, that the expansion of

                     pu cos z

must be of the form

               A + A[ cos z + A, cos2 z + &c.                                                            (3)

                     + ++ BBj sec z
                                    2 sec 2 z &c.

This series is to be multiplied by dh, and each term integrated from

sunrise to sunset. This is easily done for the cosine terms, but the secant

=terms become infinite at the limits, because z 90° at sunrise and sunset.

Hence any attempt to obtain the value of integral (2) by approximation
must be illusory, no matter how rapidly the coefficients

                     B B B &c,1? 2 , 3 ,

may diminish.

Under these circumstances it was proposed at the Dublin meeting of

the British Association (1878), to apply a small grant (30Z.) to a pre-

liminary quadrature of equation (2), at a few well-defined latitudes,
such as 0°, 30°, and 60°.

The method used was the following :

    1°. The values of pu cos z, for every value of z from 0° to 90°, were

first calculated, from which the values of p" cos z, for every zone of zenith

distance, one degree in width, were readily found.

2°. The next step was to determine how long the sun remains in any

zone of zenith distance, one degree in width, in the course of a year.

This was done, for the latitudes 0°, 30°, 60°, in the following manner

and although the calculations are not yet completed, involving as they do

300 folio sheets, enough has been accomplished to induce the Association

to proceed with the calculations for other latitudes.

   We here append the form of the tables used in computing the time

spent by the sun in each zone, of one degree of width in zenith distance,
and, as it would be a useless expenditure of money to print in full the

details of the calculations, we propose to have two fair copies of the

calculations prepared and bound together; one to be deposited in the

library of Trinity College, Dublin, and the other placed at the disposal

of the British Association.

   A complete summary of the entire results will, of course, be printed

in the Proceedings of the Association.

It will require an additional grant of 25Z. to complete the calculations

for the latitudes 0°, 30°, and 60°, and a grant of 501. would enable us to

complete the whole calculations for the latitudes 0°, 30°, 40°, 50°, and 60°.

The mean annual temperatures (as given by observations) between

0° and 30° are disturbed by the distribution of land and water, and the

temperatures of latitudes above 60° rest upon insufficient data of obser-

vation                               for which  reasons   we  propose  to       limit                                                      our      calculations  to  the

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir
    William Thomson, Dr. Merrifield, Professor Osboene Eetnolds,

   Captain Douglas Gtalton, and Mr. J. N. Shoolbred {Secretary),

    appointed for the purpose of obtaining information respecting

   the Phenomena of the Stationary Tides in the English Channel
   and, in the North Sea ; and of representing to the Government of
   Portugal and the Governor of Madeira that, in the opinion of
   the British Association, Tided Observations at Madeira or other
   islands in the North Atlantic Ocean would be very valuable,

   with the view to the advancement of our knowledge of the Tides
   in the Atlantic Ocean.

                                                [Plates II.--VIII.]

This Committee was appointed at the Plymouth meeting in 1877, to
endeavour to arrange for, and to collect the results of a series of
simultaneous tidal observations in the English Channel and in the North
Sea : and also to impress upon the Portuguese Government the advan-
tage which would accrue from the establishment of a station at Madeira
for systematic and continuous tidal observations.

     The Portuguese Government, having had this latter subject brought
under their notice by Her Majesty's Foreign Office, readily fell in with
the suggestion of the British Association ; and a self-registering tide-
gauge on Sir William Thomson's principle has been made by Messrs.
White, of Glasgow. This instrument has been sent out to Madeira, for
erection on the Loo Rock, in the Bay of Funchal, where it is hoped that
it will soon be working satisfactorily. The entire cost of construction
and of erection has been borne by the Portuguese Government, and the

instrument remains, of course, in their hands.

     The importance of an accurate knowledge of the tides at Dover in

particular, in connection with those of the entire English Channel, being

soon made evident to the Committee, as well as the great advantage
which would ensue from the establishment of a self-registering tide-gauge
at that place, the matter was brought by the Chairman under the notice
 of the Board of Trade ; the request being further supported by the Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports, Earl Granville. The Board of Trade
received the request most favourably, and consented to establish at their
own expense a self-registering gauge, at a site some distance down the
Admiralty Pier, where a tide-well had been made during the original

 construction of the pier ; its connection with the water outside being at

a level of twelve feet below the low water of ordinary spring tides. The
gauge, embracing Sir William Thomson's latest improvements, has been

-constructed and erected by Messrs. A. Lege & Co., of London, under the

direction of Mr. Edward Druce, C.E., the resident engineer in charge of

the Admiralty Works at Dover. It will remain, of course, in the hands

of, and under the control of the Board of Trade.

The Committee having secured for the simultaneous tidal observa-

tions in the English Channel and in the Irish Sea, their main duty, the

hearty co-operation of the Admiralty, of the Board of Trade, of the

French Minister of Public Works, as well as of the Minister of the same

department in Belgium, and also of a number of private observers, both

in this country and on the Continent, a programme of observations at

different times during the spring and summer of 1878 was arranged, in

accord with the different observers, a copy of which will be found in

Appendix I. These simultaneous observations extended on the English

side of the Channel from Portland to Yarmouth, while on the Continent

they embraced the coast from Havre to the mouth of the North Sea

Canal, leading up to Amsterdam.

Comparative tables are given in Appendix II., which show the

times and the levels of the high waters and of the low waters at the

different places, during the equinoctial tides observed in the month of

March                                  which  may be  taken  as typical of the two other months.  They
                                    ;

are all reduced to Greenwich time and to the level of twenty feet below

the Ordnance datum of Great Britain. This is in accordance with the

suggestion of the Committee on the Ordnance datum of Great Britain. 1

The level proposed as a datum of comparison for tidal observations of

an international character, viz., ' 20 feet below the Ordnance datum of

Great Britain,' is a point which practically coincides with ' 5'50 metres

below the French Zero du Nivellement ' (Bourdaloue), and with ' 12

feet 6 inches below the Ordnance datum of Ireland.' Some of the tidal

curves from different points of observation are also appended ; several

distinctive peculiarities, such as double tides, &c, are exhibited in them.

See Plates.

   A careful consideration of the observations shows that on one point

alone, that of tidal constants, much valuable information might be added

to that already available, if a series of simultaneous observations, of a

somewhat similar character to those just obtained, were carried out

uninterruptedly, over a considerable period, of not less than twelve

months, and over a large extent of coast. The Committee, however,

feel that such a duty hardly falls within their province. They beg to

suggest that, possibly at some future time, this subject might be

entrusted to some suitable body; the more so, that the basis of the

means of obtaining the necessary observations is already furnished by

the labours of this Committee, with a considerable extension, however, in

the number of points of observation.

Before concluding their labours, the Committee request that the

thanks of the British Association be conveyed to the First Lord of the

Admiralty, the President of the Board of Trade, the French Minister of

Public Works, the Belgian Minister of Public Works, and to the several

other authorities and private individuals, both in this country and on the

Continent, who have kindly and gratuitously had the various observations

carried out and communicated to this Committee ; and more especially
would they beg to thank the French Association for the Advancement of

Science for its cordial assistance in supporting the proposal of the British

                                              1 See p. 219 of the present volume.

ON THE PHENOMENA OF STATION AEY TIDES IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. 75
76 eepoet-- 1879.

Report of Observations of Luminous Meteors during the year
   1878-79, by a Committee consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S.,

    &c., E. P. Greg, F.G.S., F.R.A.S., C. Brooke, F.R.S., Professor G.

   Forbes, F.R.S.E., Walter Flight, D.Sc., F.G.S., and Professor

    A. S. Herschel, M.A., F.R.A.S. (Reporter).

The Committee regrets to record the loss during the past year, by Mr.

Greg's retirement from active work with the Committee and by Mr.

Brooke's death, of two most active supporters among its members. By

adding to its list the names of two observers, Mr. B. J. Lowe and

Professor R. S. Ball, who have distinguished themselves very greatly by

their contributions to this branch of astronomy, and who have consented

to take part in the Committee's further operations, it is hoped to repair

the present loss of excellent counsel and assistance which the limited

numbers of the Committee have unexpectedly sustained.

From the loss of Mr. Greg's assistance, and also to limit the extent

of this year's Report to an ordinary and reasonable length, it has been

resolved to defer for discussion until a later Report the particulars of

observations of meteor showers, annual and occasional, which have

been received during the past year, and the papers and discourses on the

connections of cometary with meteor-hypotheses that have been published

and circulated during the same time. The expected return of Biela's comet

to its perihelion in the present year, leading a shower of shooting-stars to be

looked for on November 27 next, with much confidence among astro-

nomers, will afford an occasion next year to return to this subject and to

review together the parallel results obtained in the two successive years

of observations on meteor showers of ordinary and extraordinary oc-

currence                                           of  the  Andromedes  in  November  last,  however,  nothing was
                                                ;

visible, and very unfavourable weather has generally caused only very

meagre views of the annual star showers of October, December, January,

and April last (and also of the major showers of August in this year and

last) from being seen.

The main Appendices of this Report, following a table of occurrences

of occasional phenomena of fireballs, review the discussions by different

authors of a great number of doubly observed fireballs recorded for a few

years past, describing the results and the views regarding them to which

the authors have been led by their reductions. Of these fireballs con-

spicuous detonating ones occurred in the United States on August 11

and December 30, 1878, and on January 28 (a.m.), 1879 ; in Bohemia and
Saxony on January 12, 1879 ; and in England on February 22 and 24

(a.m.), 1879, the real paths of all of which have, to a greater or less

degree of certainty and closeness, been approximately ascertained.

The pages of a few lists of meteor shower observations and reductions

furnished by Mr. Greg and Mr. Denning are also given in an Appendix.

The rest of the Report consists of the review of recent aerolitic oc-

currences and investigations by Dr. W. Flight. The falls of two aerolites

during the past twelve or fifteen months are described in this review ; at

Tieschitz, Moravia, on July 15, 1878 (a single stone), and at Esterville,

Iowa, U.S., on May 10, 1879. The last of these stonefalls was

of unexampled magnitude, one stone which fell weighing 500 lbs.,

and the other fragments which have been found, together amounting also

to a considerable weight. The historical review of researches on meteorites
during the past year, which this last appendix of the Reports contains, is
also throughout of very particular and valuable interest.

Only the resulting radiant-points of the first two of these meteors,

obtained from projections of their apparent paths, have yet been deter-

mined. The real path of the last meteor, which was a small fireball,

vertical over Brittany, in the western part of France, will be found

described in the accompanying table which exhibits a list of such results,

continued from similar lists in the last three years' Reports, of meteor

heights, &c, which have been recently determined. The following notes

include remarks and some further observations of these fireballs in

addition to those accounts of them which are given in detail in the

general fireball list of this report.

    Path of the meteor of 1868, September 5, 8h 35m p.m. Berne time
<8h 5m p.m., G.M.T.), by Gr. von Niessl. 1 This large fireball (see these

Reports, vol. for 1869, p. 226) was widely and well observed at many

places in France and Switzerland,  and in    Germany and         Italy                          and  some
                                                                                             ;

accounts of it have already been submitted to calculation by M. Tissot, 2

who places the end-point 192 miles over Mettray, near Tours, in France.

The point of first visibility and nearest approach to the earth of M.

Tissot's track, is 70 miles over Belgrade, in Servia, and the meteor's

geocentric velocity was 55 miles per second, corresponding to a helio-

centric velocity of 95 miles per second. While horizontal at Belgrade,

this is an ascending course, inclined upwards at an angle of 14° to the

horizon of Mettray, where the meteor disappeared, and these are

results which appear to require more complete demonstration before they

-can be finally adopted. Professor Weilermann3 also obtained from a

rough apparent end-point of the meteor's path at Clermont Ferrand, in
France, combined with observations of its course at Zurich, and at
several other Swiss places, a terminal height of its flight, 102 miles
over Chatillon sur Loire, a position which is to the east of Tours, but
perhaps nearly the real height at which the meteor's disappearance

actually took place.
      Professor voh. Niessl has discussed a collection of well-recorded

accounts of the meteor, including those used by Tissot and "Weilermann

and two described in these Reports (sup. cit.) at Puy de Sancy and

Geneva, and newspaper accounts, with less precise descriptions, preserved
in Continental journals.

    As seen at the Zurich Observatory, and also at a neighbouring place

in Switzerland, the fireball shot overhead, or a little south of the zenith,
from close to Jupiter near the east horizon, to near Arcturus in the west.

At Geneva and Morges, on the Lake of Geneva, it shot on a similar
course close past the star ?/ Ursee Majoris, half-way thence to the W.N.W.

horizon. French accounts state that at places in Cote d'Or, and near
Tours, it passed overhead in the latter part of its flight ; and that it
was first seen at Tremont (Saone et Loire) rising upwards in the same

field of view with the planet Jupiter, in a telescope. At Puy de Sancy
the end of its course was exactly at /3 Ursa? Majoris. At Mayence, in
Germany, it traversed the head of Capricornus, the Milky Way, and
Ophiuchus to near the S.W. horizon under a Serpentis. Its course as

+seen at Bergamo, in Italy, by Zezioli, was from 17° 3° (5° or 6° left of
Jupiter) to a point between Coma and Arcturus at 202° + 27°, the

duration of its flight, as there observed, along this long path, being 17
seconds. These were all the positions noted by the stars exactly

enough to be available for calculation.
     The observations of the end-point give a height of 115 miles (imper-

fectly defined between 70 and 140 miles) over a point very clearly
indicated near Vendome, about 30 miles N.N.E. from Tours. Using the
point so found to complete the Mayence observation, and projecting that
and the other apparent paths by their most carefully recorded points,
Professor von Niessl found as a well-defined place of the radiant-point a
position at 13°'9-- 2°, about 6° south of Jupiter's apparent place.

     The fact that several views of the meteor's first visibility in France,
Switzerland, and Italy all describe it as having first made its appearance

very close to the planet Jupiter, plainly indicates a very long course of

the meteor's flight before it approached the region of the Alps. Upon a
map the course passes backwards about 20 miles north of Belgrade

towards the south coast of the Black Sea, and at a point 460 miles above
a point near this latter coast, a little west of Sinope, the lines of sight of
the meteor's first appearance at Zurich, Morges, and Bergamo intersect
each other. But the parallax which even the base-line of Zurich and
Bergamo (two places 130 English miles apart) offer of this point, is
scarcely more than 5°. To assume it to be truly the exact place of the
meteor's first appearance, would, it might certainly be contended, be

reposing too much confidence in observers' first impressions of the earliest

point of this long-flighted and rarely splendid meteor's apparition, in a
part of its course too, where their descriptions, if accurate, should
necessai'ily have represented the meteor as appearing to them to remain

nearly stationary for several seconds.

     If, with M. Tissot, we suppose the meteor to have first made its
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

appearance over the neighbourhood of Belgrade, its height at that point,
on the course assigned to it by Professor von Niessl, would be 260 miles,
and the total length of its nearly horizontal course was close upon 1200

miles ! From the above point of geometrical intersection of the lines of

sight, however, the entire length of course is about 1780 miles.

     Professor von Niessl observes that a more southern track, with the
same radiant-point, but with a lower termination, 104 miles over Ozaine,
near Tours, passing backwards over Belgrade, and thus within 8 or 10
miles of the long course assigned to it by M. Tissot, agrees rather better
than the calculated one with the general descriptions. The observer's

view (Mr. B. F. Smith's) at Puy de Sancy, of the end of the meteor's

course, 'exactly at /3 Ursa? Majoris,' 1 gives an end-height, it should be

noticed, over Tours, of only 70 miles. But even with this minimum

elevation, and with heights over the neighbourhood of Zurich, 400 miles
from the place of extinction, variously given by observations as between
105 and 150 miles, the height over Belgrade, if we assume the meteor's
course to have been rectilinear, and to have begun so soon, cannot have
been less than 220 miles.

Performed in 17 seconds (the time of flight observed at Bergamo by

Zezioli), the course of 1200 miles from Belgrade implied a velocity of 70

miles per second. Four other observed durations varied from 12 seconds

at Clermont Ferrand to two minutes at Zurich, and the average dura-

tion from the five accounts, of 42 seconds, gives with the same course a

(' 20° or 30° ') were again described by Mr. E. Jones as the meteor's rate-

of motion ' per second ' at Geneva                                                                                                                                                        and about 120  miles of  the  terminal

part were observed at Puy de Sancy to be traversed in 4 or 5 seconds,

giving a velocity of 25 or 30 miles per second. The parabolic speed of

a meteor having the same radiant-point as that which Professor von

Niessl has obtained of this large fireball would be 26 miles per second.

But the evidence relating to the meteor's real velocity is scarcely certain

enough to allow it to be made a subject of useful speculation in compari-

son with any theoretical parabolic or other orbital velocity.

 It seems probable from this  discussion                                                                                                                                                  that  the      fireball  passed  in  the

_

brightest part of its course from about 130 miles over the Lake of Zurich

to not much less than 100 miles over the neighbourhood of Tours,

crossing the Jura range, and the Swiss and French plains near it at a

great height for a distance of 400 miles. An equal distance at least, if

not a still larger one, was traversed by the meteor along the valley of the

Drave, from a height of little less than 250 miles, near, or in the direction

of Belgrade, before crossing the range of Tyrolese Alps about that river's
source, and entering Switzerland near the Brenner pass. Professor von

Niessl confines himself to presenting the much more startling results

obtained directly from exact comparisons of the most precise descriptions

and by clearly deducing the radiant- point, and fully establishing the

meteor's great height, he, in the main, confirms M. Tissot's track, while

yet showing that it was almost exactly horizontal at Tours, where the

meteor disappeared, instead of at its first origin at Belgrade, as M. Tissot
had supposed.

was appointed immediately after the occurrence of this unusually large

fireball to collect accounts of its appearance, and to submit them to a

scientific discussion. Professor Cleveland Abbe, the Secretary of the

Committee, describes in this Report l the delay which arose in its publi-

cation from the conflicting nature of the particulars furnished by observers

of the meteor in tbe different accounts, together with a hope that a search

conducted near the point of disruption of the meteor which these accounts

had fairly established by the enquiries during the year 1874, might be
rewarded by the discovery of some fragments of its substance. But this

hope not having during the following three years been realised, the

Report containing the observations and some results of their comparison

together has no longer been withheld.
SW.The fireball passed from about N.E. to
                                           nearly over "Washington,

with an intense illumination of the streets and houses of the town

to a point so near the horizon (not more than 5° altitude), as in general

to have been lost sight of behind buildings while still continuing its
course. Professor Holden observed the terminal point at the U.S. Naval

Observatory at altitude 4°45', 22° S. from W. Accounts of its first

appearance at Washington are much less certain and precise. Professors

Newton, Hilgard, and Baird heard the explosion indoors at an interval

after the light-flash which they noted variously as 1^--3 minutes,

corresponding to a distance of the meteor's track, at its nearest point, of

18 to 36 miles from Washington. The explosion was a ' bang ' or loud

report, shaking doors, windows, and the earth, followed for 20s or 30s by
a roar or rustling sound which died gradually away. Professor Abbe

explains (in the manner theoretically investigated by Eotvos, Pog-

gendorff's 'Annals,' 1874, clii., p. 513) that the sudden clap of a

meteoric detonation is probably not caused by the final disruption, but

by the combined impulse of all the sound-waves reaching an observer's

station from the long tract of the meteor's roaring passage through the
air which is nearest to him, and from which all the sound reaches him

almost simultaneously, while a prolonged roll, like echoes of the first

sound, is afterwards heard from more distant portions of the meteor's

track.

     Accounts at Centreville and other places in Fairfax County, 30 or 40

miles W. a little S. from Washington, that the final explosion there was

nearly overhead, approximately fix the meteor's end-point, which must,
if not more distant from Washington, have been at the low height of not
more than two or three miles above the earth to satisfy the observed
altitude at Washington of its final disappearance. It seems more probable,
as Professor Chickering has endeavoured to show from more distant observa-
tions, that the meteor's flight was continued considerably beyond Fairfax
County, and that its final height (estimated at 20 miles by Professor
Chickering) was not less than 10 miles over a point some 60 or 70 miles

from Washington. The height and position of the remainder of the course
are somewhat variously defined by a great number of distant observations
at Danbury, Conn. (250 miles N.E. from Washington), at Newark,

Delaware, where its commencement was nearly overhead, at Westminster,
Mercersburgh, Baltimore, and other towns in Maryland, and at Richmond
and Appomatox Court House in Virginia. The slope of its path in the

northern sky at the two last, southern stations, and observations in

northern stations at a distance from its track, combined with the localities

over which its course seems to have passed nearly vertically, determine
approximately the initial height along this course, and the direction and

slope of the real path by which the fireball approached the earth. This is

regarded in the Report as descending from about alt. 25^°, 30° N. from E.

(as measured from the map of the American States, and of the meteor's

projected path, appended to it), from a height of about 90 miles over the

northern point of Delaware State, in Newcastle County, to the low point

of disappearance which it reached near Fairfax County. The celestial

+position of the corresponding radiant-point is at 115° 38°.

     The observation most at variance with this deduction is that at
Richmond, where the apparent downward slope of the meteor's path at
disappearance was but 11° from horizontal, corresponding to a much
slighter real gradient of the meteor's path than 25^°, and to a height of

only 42 instead of 90 miles above Newcastle County at its first appearance.

A fair compromise between this and the Washington and other observa-

tions of the early part of the meteor's course would be effected if its
downward flight to the extinction point is regarded as having reached it

from a slightly modified direction at alt. 16°, 18° N. from B. instead

of alt. 25^°, 30° N. from B. ; and of this new provisional direction the

+ +corresponding celestial radiant-point is 116° 24°, instead of 115° 38°.
A +certain range denoted by the position 113°(±3°), 32°( =!= 6°) may

perhaps be indicated as the bounding limits within which a direction of

the meteor's flight may be considered to satisfy fairly the majority of the

observations. This is not so far distant from Mr. Denning's observed

position of a ' Geminid ' radiant-point on December 31, 1872 (D. 1872-

+76, 27 ; at 108° 36°), as to make it improbable that this grand detonating

fireball was a surpassingly large member of an already well-recognised
and established system of December shooting- stars.

tional observation of the meteor (described in the present fireball list) by

Committee by Major Tupman. No very material alteration of the real

course is, however, so produced, as Mr. Christie's observation is in

extremely close agreement with those of the observers at Birmingham

a rather later commencement was observed at Blackheath than at
Birmingham and Leicester, and the time of flight, though not noted
carefully at Blackheath, was thought to be about one or two seconds only,
instead of five or six seconds for its slow passage at Birmingham. The

Birmingham and Blackheath, being at the same time less than that

observed at Birmingham alone, the calculated real velocity still remains

about 12 or 15 miles per second, which very nearly agrees with the

parabolic speed, about 13 miles per second, of a meteor from the actual

position that another example is afforded by this double observation, of a

detonating fireball proceeding from a known centre of divergence of

ordinary shooting-stars.

   --1878, August 11, 10h 10m p.m. (Indianapolis time) ; West Virginia

and Pennsylvania, U.S. Descriptions of this meteor at three points in
the centrarpart of the United States, collected by Professor Kirkwood,
enabled him to deduce approximately its real course. At Bloomington,
Ind., it shot northwards some 20° in the east with a track slightly
declining downwards from alt. 10° at first appearance in the east.

By a rough estimate the time of flight scarcely exceeded two seconds. At

Titusville, Pa., in that direction, near the point of concourse of the
three States of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio, the meteors shot

northwards in the west, lighting up the country more strongly than the
full moon, with a greenish light, bursting at last into one large, and
two red fragments, and giving rise to a report like thunder heard at an
interval after the fireball's disruption corresponding to a distance from
Titusville of 25 miles. The meteor also moved from south to north over
Oil city, Venango County, Pa., a meridian through the western boundary
of which county must have been the projected direction of its course upon

a map. This real course is 348 miles east from Bloomington, so that the
meteor's probable elevation at first appearance was about 77 miles over

the northern part of West Virginia, and 160 or 175 miles from the place
of final disruption of the fireball into fragments west of Titusville. The
duration there of its illumination was 'momentary,' so that the only
recorded estimates of its time of flight seem to denote a real velocity
much greater than would correspond to original motion of the fireball in

a parabolic orbit. The radiant point of the adopted real path is about at

292°-31°                                           but if  (as is quite possible)  the  real  path's  geographical  pro-

at some point of a great circle of the heavens passing through this

--adopted place and through a point on the equator at about R.A. 10°.
    1878, November 18, 9h 50m p.m. Besides the determination of this
small fireball's real course (seen by Mr. Corder and Mr. Denning at

Writtle and at Bristol) by Professor Herschel, in the ' Observatory,' *

where the original observations of its appearance are given as described

in the accompanying fireball list by Mr. Denning, the real height and

position of its course were independently calculated by Major Tupman

with results which were not at very great variance with those already

published. The height, position, and extent of the fireball's real path

have now been reinvestigated by Major Tupman and Professor Herschel

on the assumption that the short arc which it appeared at Bristol to

describe, was but the end-part of a much longer flight, the whole visible
extent of which was equally well seen and mapped at Writtle by

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            j

Mr. Coi'der. No observation of the time of flight was recorded from

which the real velocity might have been determined ; but the real

direction of the meteor's course is fonnd to be so exactly conformable to a
centre of divergence of a meteor shower detected by Mr. Denning on

--the nights of December 1 2, 1877 (including a bright fireball from
--334° 11° to 322° -181°), that a connection of the fireball with this

newly discovered November-December meteor system may be pretty

certainly concluded.

     1877, December 9, 8h 12m p.m. Meteor as bright as Jupiter observed

--in Kent and Essex, and at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The path

of this bright meteor has been computed from the data of its appearance
at Writtle and Bromley given in last year's report, with the addition
to them of observations of the meteor in London, and at the Royal

Observatory, Greenwich, now added in the present fireball list. Mr.

Corder's opinion that the meteor belonged to a system of bright streak-
leaving, long-pathed meteors diverging on the same night from the
direction of a companion radiant of the ' Geminid ' shower, near i
 Geminorum, is exactly confirmed by the combined projection of all the
observations ; and a satisfactory agreement is at the same time found

among them for determining the height and locality, and the real velocity
of the meteor's flight. These results Major Tupman has deduced with
the new materials of the Greenwich and London observations which he
supplied, among other reductions of double observations of large meteors
which he obtained last year, and he obligingly communicated them to the

Committee as they are briefly represented in the present Table.

   --1878, December 30, 6h 55m p.m. (Indianapolis Time) ; Ohio, Indiana,

and Pennsylvania, U.S. This is another bright fireball of which Pro-
fessor Kirkwood has collected and discussed some observations (see the
accompanying general meteor list, and the fireball of August ll, 1878,
above), in the Paper on Large Fireballs of the years 1878-79, which he

communicated in May last to the American Philosophical Society. By a

description at Washington, Pa., the attention of an observer walking

eastwards was arrested by a sudden light like that of an additional street
lamp lighted close behind him. Turning after a little time to that direction,
he saw a meteor about half the full moon's apparent diameter (which was
then shining brightly, but behind houses) falling in the W.N.W., large
and brilliant, and of a slight greenish colour. After coursing about 24°
(from near a Cygni to near a Lyra?, by a later visit with Professor
M'Adam, of Washington and Jefferson College, to the same place) it
changed its colour to a reddish tint and disappeared. It was seen at
Anderson, Indiana, about 270 miles due west from Washington, Pa.,

com m encing due east, at an altitude of between 15° and 17°, and imme-

diately disappearing behind houses.

      The description at Wooster, Ohio (which is given in the accom-
panying meteor-list) assigned very exact positions of both the points of

appearance and disappearance of the course. Combined with the account
at Washington, Pa., it gives the end-height and position of the meteor

over a point (in Tuscarawas County, Ohio) 70 miles distant W. by N. from

the latter station, while the point of commencement is found, by com-

bining the account at Anderson, Ind., with that at Wooster, Ohio, to

have been 72 miles over Columbiana County, Ohio, lat. 40° 50' N, long.
 3° 40' W. from Washington. The whole length of the track seen at

 Washington, Pa., was about 85 miles, descending with a slope of 45° from

                                                                  G2

SW.a direction nearly due N.E. towards  This corresponds at the time-

and place of the meteor's disappearance to a celestial position of the-

+radiant point at 174° 56°, near y Ursae Majoris. Of its real speed of

motion exact enough observations of the fireball's time of flight were not

obtained to afford a satisfactory determination. From the nearest point

of view at Wooster, Ohio, a disruption of the nucleus was seen about 20°

along its course before its point of disappearance, of which no mention

is made in the account at Washington (much further from the real
track), so that the fragments into which the meteor then broke appear
to have been unseen (as was also the case in distant observations of the
large fireball of August 11, 1878) at the more distant station. The final
height determined is that of the disruption seen at Wooster, and it seems
probable that the fragments pursued their course and penetrated while

in sight to a still closer proximity than that deduced above of 17 or 18

miles, to the surface of the earth.

    1879, January 12, 7h 25m and 7h 32m p.m., Berlin time ; large fire-

--balls, the first detonating, seen in Bohemia and Saxony. Of these two

fireballs, which appeared within a few minutes of each other, Professor von

Niessl collected a large number of accounts sufficiently exact and definite-

in their descriptions, in spite of cloudy skies on the date of their appearance,

to enable him to assign their real courses with precision. 1 The two

meteors pursued real courses over the middle of Bohemia, nearly at right

angles to each other, the first extremely large and detonating, the second

a much smaller meteor, but also casting a strong light. It was hence

simply observed in some of the locally described accounts that the par-
ticulars furnished by various observers were too contradictory and op-
posed to each other to be worth recording in detail ; the detonation of
the first meteor seems also to have been sometimes ascribed to the second
one, with whose appearance, at some places, it must have occurred almost
simultaneously. But both meteors were well seen and described by at
least one single observer (the railway station-master at Neucunnersdorf)
and exact descriptions, at other places, of the two meteors present no
confusion, and could in general be easily distinguished and separated
from each other.

     The nucleus of the first meteor, as seen from a distance, was globular,

resembling the moon's disc in apparent size (and perhaps also in colour,
which was not noted), followed by a thin tail, and bursting at last into
sparks, while a portion pursued its career and was visible for a short

distance further. It cast a light as strong as that of a moonlight night
over the greater part of Bohemia, and as bright as daylight in the streets-

of Prague. The sound of its explosion in that city was like a sudden

thunderclap, of 3-20 seconds duration, heard in a minute and a half after
the meteor's disappearance, shaking doors and windows, and rattling

together objects placed on shelves and tables, and even according to one
description at Rostock, near Prague, breaking window-panes. The time-
interval of the sound probably corresponds to a distance (about 18 miles)
of the nearest point of the meteor's track from Prague, rather than to-
that (about 27 miles) of its end-point from the town.

     The fireball ended its course at a height of only 9 miles, nearly over
Rakonitz, due west of Prague, where it seems to have arrived by a flight
of somewhat uncertainly determined length from the direction of a

of ' Cancrids' (December 21-January 5, 130° + 20°), and the comet of

+1680 (December 26, 132° 21- 5°), 2 together with the fireball of January

19, 1877, seen in England, Wales, and Ireland, 3 all present radiant-

points with which this new detonating fireball's real point of departure

was thus found to be nearly concentric in position.
     Although doubtless visible (as some of the descriptions show) at a

much earlier period of its flight, the first point at which the fireball's

course was well observed, and for which the time of flight was also noted,
was at a height of 41 miles above the earth's surface, 125 miles from the
end-point of its track. This distance it traversed in 5 seconds ; and

shorter lengths of the latter part of its flight were seen to be traversed,
by five other observers, in times varying from 2\ to 5 seconds. The

meteor's mean velocity at last, from all these estimates, was 17 miles per

second; while that of the fireball of January 19, 1877 (scarcely so
well determined) was not less than 35 miles per second. The parabolic

speed of meteors from this radiant-point is 23 miles per second, which is

intermediate between these two observed velocities.

The near approach of this fireball's luminous track to the earth's

surface is a rare and remarkable feature of the above described results of
its appearance, and it is very certainly determined. The depth to which the

igneous mass of the meteor penetrated the atmosphere accounts at once,

as Professor von Niessl conjectures, for the violence of the explosion, and

for the moderate velocity with which it appears at last to have been tra-

versing the air. The same condition of unusually deep penetration he con-

siders may also have occasioned the remarkably slow'relative velocity of the
fireball of November .27, 1877, whose end-height Major Tupman found to

be only 14 miles, and" whose velocity relative to the earth he showed not

to have exceeded 5 miles per second, answering in the visible part of that

fireball's flight to a very short elliptic, and nearly circular orbit round

the sun.

It may be noticed here that a remarkable resemblance of the latter

fireball's real orbit to that of Biela's comet was pointed out by Mr. Hind,

of which the following particulars, here transcribed in full, appeared in

neously with the meteor's passage appear to be referable to the distant

detonation of the earlier meteor. The real velocity, as far as it can be

gathered, from only two observed durations of limited portions of the

track near its termination was (from each of these) about 12^ miles per

second. This is exactly the parabolic speed of meteors from the same

radiant-point, the celestial position of which, as obtained from the fore-

--going discussion of the meteor's real course, was at 52° 10° (±5°).

Professor von Niessl points out the coincidence of the resulting radiant

with that of the fireball of January 7, 1877, observed at Birmingham

and in London, of which he finds the radiant-point from the observations

--to have been about 48° 11°, instead of the place assigned to it by

similar projections in these Reports (vol. for 1877, p. 135), at about

--58°(±8°) 14°. But the position of both of these fireballs appears yet

to be in very close agreement with the centre of the January ' Eridanid '

shower which Mr. Denning found on January 4-20, 1877 (D. 2, 1877)

the fireball, in fact, burst overhead. It appeared four times as large

as the full moon, with an intensity of brightness surpassing that of sun-

shine, and its explosion, which followed at a very brief interval, resembled
that of musketry. Its direction was nearly from S. W. to N.E. About as

much further in the same direction, at Cheboygan, Michigan, the light
was seen within doors, casting shadows as it approached from S.W. until

it disappeared. Its greatest (and apparently first) altitude (?), estimated

by the positions of the shadows, was found to be about 45°. No sound of

an explosion was audible at this place (near, but in advance of tbe meteor's

termination), which seems to be confirmatory of the view, elsewhere ex-

pounded, that the sudden concussion of a meteor-clap is not the conse-

quence of a disruption, but a cumulative sound, or combined acoustic

effect, at places near to and on one side of the meteor's course, of the

sound produced, and reaching an observer simultaneously from long tracts

of its fiery passage through the air. 1 Regarding the meteor's course

(apparently, from Mr. Walton's description, indoors, of the moving light

and shadows, at Cheboygan) as a steeply descending one, Professor

--Kirkwood is led, roughly, to the following general conclusions : The

fireball first came in sight nearly 100 miles over a point about 30 miles

S.W. of Great Traverse City (at lat. 44° 25', long. 9° W.), and it disap-

peared about 26 miles above a point about 42 miles N.E. by eastwards

from that town. The whole visible track was 124 miles, and its projection

on the earth's surface 66 miles in length from a direction S.W. by S.

towards N.E. by N. Of the time of flight, which was described as several

seconds, and of the real velocity, except that the observations indicate a

rather slow motion, nothing very definite can be affirmed.

The altitude of the radiant-point appears from this description to have

been about 55°, and from the course, 33^° W. of S., from which it was

directed, the meteor's radiant-point may be assigned provisionally at about

+142°  14°                 but  this cannot evidently be regarded as an exact  determina-

tion. It is close to the border-line dividing Leo from the constellation

Cancer, and a suspicion may perhaps be entertained that, like the fireballs

above described, of January 12, 1879, and January 19, 1877, this imposing

aerolitic meteor of January 27-8, 1879, may have been a conspicuous

member of one of the ' Cancrid ' meteor systems which have been recog-

nised as discernible in December, January, and February, and as apparently

concentric in the first and last of those months with the hypothetical

radiant-points of the comets of 1680 and 1833.

  --1879, February 22, 12 h 20m a.m. Detonating meteor ; Essex. Ac-

cording to the descriptions at Haverhill and Saffron Walden, two towns

scarcely ten miles apart east and west of each other, on the northern con-

fines of Essex, that the meteor passed from south to north between them

with a prodigious light and a report like thunder, audible in 20-45 seconds,

going east of the zenith to an end-point in N.E. at Saffron Walden, and

going overhead and down to N.W. at Haverhill, as the height above these

towns corresponding to the sound interval is only six or eight miles, the

meteor's track, at its close near them, cannot have extended many miles

Anorthward of their position into Cambridgeshire.  height of five or six

have occurred, if the time interval at the former place and at Saffron

one to the case of the present meteor. The sound of its extinction and nearest
approach to the earth, about 25 miles from Birmingham, towards which town its
course was nearly directed, was not perceived there, although at the greater distance
(about 30-35 miles) at which the meteor passed, when nearest, by the town of
Leicester, a sound like thunder, attributed to the meteor, was heard at that place by

Mr. F. T. Mott. The observer at Galashiels on May 12, 1878, also heard a peal of

thunder, apparently proceeding from the fireball of that date, no sound of which was
heard in Edinburgh or Bathgate, nearly over which towns the meteor disappeared.

Walden can be regarded as carefully observed. 1 Bat the statement at
Bury St. Edmonds, 15 miles due east of Newmarket, that the meteor
1 was seen in the west moving slowly downwards like a ball of fire falling

to the earth,' while it cannot be strictly interpreted as a vertical descent,
since the meteor reached that neighbourhood from vertically over Brent-
wood, in the south, yet points to Newmarket, 15 miles due west of Bury,
as about the extreme point which the meteor perhaps reached, northwards,
in its descending route. It ' passed overhead ' at Brentwood, ' from S.S.W.
to N.N.E.,' a place of observation which is about 40 miles due south from

Newmarket, and 20 miles E.N.E. from London ; and at Godalming, 30
miles S.W. from London, it lighted the interior of a room facing south so
strongly, that a real path of the meteor towards Newmarket passing nearly
over or but little east of London, and descending with a sensible inclina-
tion, appears necessary to satisfy these several observations, and it accounts

perfectly for the description given of its course at Bury, that it appeared

' descending slowly like a fireball falling to the earth.' The line of flight in
this course probably extended from about 75 miles over the neighbourhood
of Redhill to five miles over a point two or three miles south or east from
Newmarket, passing over Greenwich, and at a height of 40 miles over a

point 10 miles west from Brentwood. W.Its slope is from alt. 45°, 20°

from south ; and its length (for which no exact limits can be stated) was
about 110 miles. It yet seems possible that the Bury and Brentwood

observations may be satisfied by a rather lower line of flight than this, if

the disappearance was only five or six miles high five or six miles north of
Haverhill, which is not at all impossible. With such small admissible
adjustments of the end-point, a great variety of initial points and of slopes
and directions of the real course might be selected which would not at all
conflict with the exceedingly distinct but yet not accurate and precise
descriptions of the apparent track at Bury and at Brentwood. Heights
of 50-75 miles at commencement over any point between Godstone or
Reigate and Dorking or Guildford in Surrey, combined with a proper
end-point, would thus answer the imposed conditions, presenting various
slopes of path from altitudes of 35°-45°, and from directions between 15°

and 30° W. of south. These paths pass at heights of 30 to 40 miles over

points not more than 10-15 miles west from Brentwood, and might all
there be perfectly described as passing ' overhead.' They would all
occupy the south-western sky at Bury, ending due west, or but little south
of west, and might there be described as ' in the west ; ' and lastly, their
apparent slope in the sky, towards disappearance, would never be less
than 45° or 50°, so as to admit fairly of the description there, that the
meteor appeared ' falling towards the earth.' That the meteor's slope of
path was much greater than 45° appears scarcely probable, as the long
extent and duration of the full splendour of its flight, generally attested
by the observations, would not be very easily accounted for by a real path

whose slope was much greater than this, or whose grade at the utmost
materially exceeded 50°. The limits above adopted as extreme possible

positions of the radiant-point were at the time of the meteor's appearance
between the head of Hydra and Sextans at R.A. 135° to 145°, and N. decl.
0° to 10°, immediately adjoining the equator, between those constellations,

     1 The interval noted by a policeman at Saffron Walden was ' 20 seconds, or the
same as the duration of the meteor's light. ' At Haverhill, an observer states, < I should
think that the meteor lasted five seconds or more ; and half a minute or three quarters
of a minute after there was a sound like thunder.'

determinations. Thus in Tupman's catalogue, No. 3, January 4, is at

he derived from the observations (these Reports, vol. for 1877, p. 135),

was fairly well determined at 145°-5°. In Mr. Denning' s new list of

stationary meteors, one of fourth magnitude, observed by Mr. B. F. Sawyer

on February 24, 1878, is recorded at 145°+ 8°, which is very close to the

presumed place of the radiant-point of the great detonating meteor seen

this year on the morning of February 22.

  --1879, February 24, 2h 53m a.m. ; Yorkshire. Large detonating fire-

ball. The surprising and alarming nature of this meteor's apparition in

York and its neighbourhood was described in the ' York Herald ' and in

Athe ' Middlesborough Gazette.'  pear-shaped ball of fire travelled at

York across the sky, casting a light upon the town as strong as that of

day. After a moment's interval following the fireball's disappearance, a

peal of thunder burst upon the town, wakening sleepers who had not yet

been aroused by the blaze of light, and shaking doors, windows, and the

houses. The same occurred at Stockton, but a snowstorm, which only

began immediately after the sight appeared at York, was there raging,

and also at Newcastle at the time ; and the intensity of the light at these

places, ' as bright as a summer day,' which the invisible body shed upon

the scene, ' changing in about a dozen seconds from white to a beautiful

blue before it disappeared,' was all the more surprising (though perhaps

exalted by the whiteness of the snow) from the thickness of the storm.

The shock of the explosion was even more incomprehensible on this

account at Stockton than at York, and it seems to have more universally

inspired alarm, and to have passed for an earthquake shock, in the northern

part of the county than at York, where the fireball was well seen. At Liver-

pool the sky was clear, and the meteor, like a powerful rocket, but without

a tail of sparks, illuminated the town vividly, and was watched for some

seconds, even in streets from which little of the sky was visible, travelling

rapidly away in a south-easterly direction. It was distinctly seen at

Stockport, near Manchester, an observer walking N.N.B. perceiving, when

half dazzled by the light, up in the air on his right, a whitish globe of

light with a mist of pale colour round it that lighted up the landscape for

a second and made every object visible in the distance. At Birmingham,

officials leaving the chief post-office turned about at the light, which was

like that of an electric lamp, and called each other's attention to a large

pear-shaped object falling slowly down over the houses in a E.N.E. or N.

by E. direction, leaving a bright tail of some considerable length behind

it, and soon disappearing, when the sky then became intensely black.

The harbour-master of Shoreham (six miles west of Brighton, and 213

miles south from York) saw it pass in about 30 seconds between two hills

north of him, beginning at an altitude of 11° ' N. by W.,' and going

thence ' to N.W. by W., in a considerable curve,' with a long tail like a

kite, of a magenta colour, making everything around as bright as day.

At Dundee (185 miles N.N.W. from York), it ' fell in a westerly direction

from a dark cloud hanging apparently over the rising ground west of

Newport. When first seen it gave forth a clear silvery light, which

quickly changed into purple, and afterwards the meteor assumed a bar-

like form, one end of which was brightly red. The morning was clear and

frosty, but notwithstanding this the temporary illumination was almost
startling in its brilliancy.' (' Dundee Advertiser,' March 25, 1879.)

     The vague descriptions contained in nearly all the newspaper para-
graphs not allowing of any accurate deductions, Mr. J. E. Clark, of York,
applied himself, by correspondence with persons at a distance, and by many

actual measurements at York, to collect materials for determining the

meteor's real path. At York the meteor disappeared, as well as could be

ascertained, 41° W. of S., altitude 10°, observed by a point above the

Minster roof, near one of its towers. The point of first appearance was
less certain, but whether to the north or to the south side of the zenith,
the apparent path of the meteor certainly passed very nearly overhead.
The time interval of arrival of the sound was practically obtained in several
cases by repeating actions during the interval from recollection, and it was
very nearly 1^--If minute, while one observer estimated it at half a minute,
and another as ' fully two or three minutes,' or twice the longest time
taken for a clap of thunder to arrive. The former of these exceptional

cases is probably below, and the latter, though confidently stated, probably
above the truth, and a lapse of one and a half or two minutes, it seems
probable, must have really intervened, corresponding to a distance or real
height of the meteor's flight over York, of 18-25 miles. For determining

the height and position of the point of disappearance but one useful obser-

vation, that of Mr. S. Walliker, at Hull, can be satisfactorily combined
with the York line of sight, although the very distant description at

Dundee confirms in a general way the position which was so obtained.
By a careful plan of his position, which was at his own front door, Mr.
Walliker found the apparent path at Hull to have been from 4° W. of N.,.

alt. (estimated) 60°, beginning perhaps before caught sight of about 10°

E. of N., to W. by N., alt. 20° (estimated altitude). The intersection of

the latter line with thai; of the disappearance seen at York is midway
between Selby and Leeds, only 16 miles S.W. from York. The corre-

sponding height of the meteor above the earth's surface at this point, on
the York line of sight, is only three miles ; another observer's estimated
altitude of 30° would give ten miles, but with allowance for unconscious

exaggeration near the horizon, cannot increase the final height certainly

to more than six or seven !

To find the point of first appearance, from equally scanty data, a

valuable account at Whitby, by Captain E. Heselton, of the ' Margery,'

passing two miles N.W. of Whitby on the voyage from Seaham to

Scarborough, when the meteor was observed, states that it passed directly

W.overhead, from alt. 45°, 20° E. of N. to alt. 45°, 20°  of S., a course

which, prolonged, passes through York and Selby, and substantiates the

other observations. On this track the direction and distant altitude at

Hull, as well as those obtained at York, make the meteor's height over

Whitby 65 or 80 miles ; but regarding them, from their character as

estimates, as overrated, the probable height of the fireball over Whitby,

40 miles N.N.W. from York, can scarcely have been more than 40 or 50

miles. This estimate, making the meteor's height as it does, over York,

about 17 or 18 miles, agrees with the time interval of the sound there,
and leads it to be regarded as probably a near approximation to a point

of early appearance in the meteor's real path. That it began at a much
earlier point is shown by Captain Heselton's first view of it 45° before

reaching the zenith at Whitby, and by the brightness of its light behind

the snow-clouds in the north-east for some seconds before the nucleus
could be distinguished, exactly resembling the light of the moon rising
behind the clouds in that direction.

    It may therefore be concluded that the meteor passed about 40 miles
over a point just south of Whitby and about 20 miles nearly over, but one

or two miles north of York, to a point not more than six or eight miles
above the earth, about midway between Leeds and Selby. The direction
of this path is from 39° E. of N., alt. 32°, which at the time of the
meteor's appearance corresponds to a celestial place of the computed

+radiant-point at 310° 55°, near x Cephei, a position, in February or

March, of which no morning observations hitherto appear to have been
obtained. The radiants of the comets 1854 IV. (Weiss, Feb. 13,

+304° + 37°-5), and 1845 I. (Feb. 25, 309° 30°-5), appear also to be too

distant from this place to be compatible with the fireball observations.

1858, August 13, 6h 39m p.m. Fireball over the English Channel-

According to the observation of Mr. Pope Hennessey in London (these

Reports, vol. for 1858, p. 152), a fireball exactly similar to that described

near Ryde passed in two seconds from S.S.E., alt. 25°, to S.S.W., alt. 12°.

At Ryde it travelled in 3-5 seconds from about E.S.E., alt. 15°, to S.S.E.,

alt. 20°. The lines of bearing intersect for the commencement about 20

miles off the French coast at Dieppe, 95 miles from both Ryde and Lon-

don                   and for the end point about half-way between Cherbourg and
                   ;

Brighton, 95 miles from London and 35 miles from Ryde. Comparing

together the altitudes and distances at which the first and last points

respectively of the meteor's course were observed from the two places, it

will be seen that there is no exact agreement, the altitudes at the com-

mencement being 25° and 15° at the same distance, 95 miles, from London

and Ryde, while those of the end point are 12° and 20°, instead of about

8° and 20°, corresponding to the distances of 95 and 35 miles from Lon-

don and from Ryde. In order to remove the discrepancy, the altitudes at

first appearance cannot be retained without an enormous rotation north-

wards of both of the lines of sight of the meteor's starting point. It is

true that very small departures of the two end point bearings from their

assigned directions, by removing the end point southwards, would bring

the final altitudes into good agreement. But it seems more probable that

both the altitudes (12° and 25°) at London are as usual a little overrated,

and if they are diminished by a third part, to 8° and 17°, their agreement

with the altitudes observed at Ryde is then extremely close. The con-

cluded heights are then 28 miles over the first and 12 miles over the last

of the two points of intersection, and the length of path is 75 miles directed

from an altitude of about 12° nearly due east. The correction which this

provisional path seems to require most urgently is increase of height,

especially at the end point. It would, in this case, be more nearly hori-

zontal, and at the same time directed somewhat towards the south of

west, or from somewhat north of east. The provisional radiant point on

this supposition was about 5° north of east, alt. 5° ; and of this origin of

its flight, as a fairly probable direction, the corresponding celestial place

has been adopted in the table. The uncertainty of the meteor's real height

and distance scarcely allows its real velocity ( 75 miles in 2 or 41 seconds)
to be very confidently derived from the observed durations. The para-

bolic speed for the adopted radiant-point is 25 miles per second.

  --1877, October 8-9, midnight. Fireball in Holland. Two observations

of this fireball besides that mapped by Mr. Denning (these Reports, vol.

for 1878, p. 282) were obtained, at Antwerp, and near Mezieres, on the

French frontier of Belgium. Although of the vaguest description, they

yet confirm each other and support Mr. Denning's conjecture of the

meteor's radiant point. Adopting this as quite certainly established, the

meteor's real path may be pretty surely determined from the rough account

of its apparent course at Antwerp. It appears to have been from 80 miles

above a point of the German Ocean 15 miles due west of Allemaar to 35

miles above the sea 60 miles due west of the same town in Holland. The

real length of path, 63 miles, performed in four seconds, gives a velocity

relative to the earth of nearly 16 miles per second. The parabolic speed

+for the meteor's adopted radiant-points at 77° 34° is 40 - 5 miles per

second.

--brilliant fireball (? two distinct ones) over Rouen and the mouth of the

Seine, France. No time of appearance was recorded by one observer,
Mons. Martin, in Paris, who described the fireball as proceeding 'from

near Ursa Major towards the left,' and as this is opposed to another de-

scription in Paris, that it fell almost vertically, a little inclined from left

to right, and is only imperfectly corroborated by a third statement there,

that the nearly vertical descent (in the west) was ' a little inclined from
N.W. towards S.E.' (? S.W.), it is just possible that two other observa-

perfectly similar and very similarly situated meteor to the later one, of

which this discordant account in Paris may have been an additional

description. But the celestial positions of the later meteor's path at ' 7
p.m.,' given by the observer in the Department of La Manche (which were

indeed only gathered from descriptions), are also quite irreconcileable

with the delineation of the meteor's course by the stars at Clermont

Ferrand, although in conjunction with all the other statements they also

agree in defining the radiant point's position as very near the zenith.

The whole of the very conflicting particulars of the recorded paths and

times of appearance of the meteor may therefore perhaps relate really to

the descent of only a single great fireball near the mouth of the Seine a
few minutes before 7 o'clock (Paris time) on the evening of October 8.
The stars between Cygnus and Cepheus were in the zenith at that hour,
and the meteor was without doubt directed from one of the northernmost

of the Lacertid group of radiants in Lacerta and Cepheus, which are

thickly clustered in and about the latter constellation in October. No

sound of a detonation appears to have been distinguished, although the

fireball burst ' like a bombshell ' at the end of its course into many

brilliant pieces ; and it left a streak visible for a few seconds only on its

course.

The Butcher Meteoric Irons of Oohakuila}

    Dr. L. Smith publishes a further paper on the new mineral occurring
in the irons, to which mineral he has given the name of Daubreelite. It

possesses the following composition :

It is a sulphide corresponding in atomic constituents to the well-known
oxide, chromite (FeO,-Gr03 ), daubreelite being FeS,-CrS 3 , sulphur re-
placing the oxygen. The calculation of the composition is based upon
the sulphur found in the analyses. The finer powder obtained by cutting
sections of the irons are treated with a magnet to remove the nickel-iron
that remaining consists of torilite and daubreelite. This is then digested

with strong hydrochloric acid several times ; all the troilite dissolves

readily, and the residue consists of the new sulphide. ' It consists of

shining black fragments, more or less scaly in structure, not altogether
unlike fine particles of molybdenite. ' The fracture is uneven, except in
one direction, where there appears to be a cleavage. It is brittle and easily

pulverised, the fine particles retaining their brilliancy. It is not magnetic,
and but slightly altered before the blow-pipe. It is not acted upon in
the slightest degree by hydrochloric acid, either cold or hot, but dissolves

slowly and completely in nitric acid when warmed with it. The specific

gravity is 5*01

     Other meteoric irons, such as those from Toluco, Mexico, and Sevier

Co., Tennessee, contain this mineral.

                               The Ovifah Irons.-- Found 1870. 2

    The Academy of Sciences of Paris appointed a commission to report
on a paper by Dr. Lawrence Smith on the supposed native iron of
Greenland, and their report has recently been presented by M. Daubree.
It is pointed out that the bodies which come from beyond our atmo-
sphere, and which are called meteorites, present, as regards their minera-

logical constitution, a most striking resemblance to certain terrestrial
rocks. The important fact that masses derived from most widely sepa-
rated regions of space should present such resemblances was pointed out
by Nordenskjold in 1870, when he discovered large masses of native iron
at Ovifak, on the island of Disco, Greenland. The first thought which
suggested itself to him was that they were of meteoric origin. In order
to explain the fact that these masses were fused into the basalt, he

assumed that they had fallen into it while it was still liquid. Many
adopted this view, and, among others, Nauckhoffand Tschermak. Steen-

strup, on the other hand, after visiting the locality twice, came to the
conclusion that they were masses of native iron, and that they had the

same terrestrial origin as the basalt itself. Not far from Ovifak, in the

Waigatstrasse, Steenstrap found evidence -which supported this theory
in the basalt of Igdlokungoak he hit upon a mass of metalliferous mag-
netic pyrites weighing about 28,000 kilog., and again, in the basalt of
Aussuk, small grains of native iron. The graphite associated with this
iron pointed to the probability that carbonaceous substances had reduced
this metal ; moreover, the rock enclosing the native iron contained the

silicate of ferric hydrate which has received the name of Hisingerite.
With these opposing views so plainly set forth, Dr. L. Smith has gone
over the whole question, and comes to the same conclusion as Steenstrup,
that the masses of metal are of terrestrial origin. He finds that in the

dolerite of Aussuk, as well as that of Ovifak, which it closely resembles,
metallic iron is found enclosed in labradorite ; anorthite is likewise
found in certain parts of the mass of the rock, and oligoclase also.

     Iron has been obtained from seven localities in Greenland : from
Sowallicke, Fiskenas, Niakornak, Gliick's Bay, Jacobstown, Ovifak, and
Aussuk. The iron of Sowallicke and Niakornak is found by Dr. L.
Smith to contain combined carbon, just as the Ovifak iron does : in fact,
he states that all specimens of iron obtained from Greenland are similar
in this respect, and differ from meteoric iron, which contains no com-

bined carbon ; moreover, these masses all contain cobalt in considerable

quantity in relation to nickel. Dr. Smith next refers to the similar

geological character of the area where the iron has been found, it being

found only in the basalt region, which extends from 69° to 76°, where it

Wedisappears under a huge glacier.  shall probably never know how

wide the extent is of this volcanic area which stretches far away

north ; that, however, which has been seen represents an area equal

Weto one extending from Gibraltar to Brest.  know that the terrestrial

rocks which present the closest resemblance to the meteoric rocks belong

to the lowest beds of the earth. Some are eruptive rocks of a basic

character, consisting of anorthite and augite, like certain lavas from

Iceland ; others are olivinous rocks, like lherzolite, to which the meteorites

-- --containing magnesia those, in fact, of the ordinary type belong. The

gangne of olivinous rocks accompanying the platinum of the Urals, and

the presence of nickel in the native iron combined with the platinum,

have confirmed these relations, which are of interest alike for the geologist

and the astronomer. It was expected that among the aluminous and

magnesian rocks some might be found in which iron should begin to

make its appearance, and this gap has now been filled. In the Greenland

beds layers of lignite are found associated with the basalt, and this may

have furnished the material which has reduced the iron to the metallic

state.

           --The Siderolite of Bittersgriin. Found 1833.

     The examination by Dr. Clemens Winkler of the siderolite of Ritters-
grun, Saxony, shows it to accord closely in composition with the siderolite
of Breitenbach in Bohemia, examined some years since (1871) in the

Laboratory of the Mineral Department of the British Museum ; and to

strengthen the view expressed at the time that these bodies, as well as
the meteorite of Steinbach im Erzgebirge were probably members of

(died 1609) as having fallen ' im Meissnischen' at Whitsuntide, 1164.

The Rittersgriin meteorite was found in 1833 by a workman employed

in clearing the forest, and offered for sale as old iron to the smith, but

without success ; but in 1861 it came to the notice of the lamented

Professor Breithaupt, and was secured for the mineral collection of the

Berg-Akademie, of Freiburg. Its mean diameter is -43 metre, and its

weight 86'5 kilogrammes. It has recently been sawn through in Vienna,

a troublesome and costly labour extending over two months. An excel-

lent chromo-lithograph of the surface thus exposed was prepared by

Professor Weisbach, in 1876, and published with a few notes.

The meshwork of nickel-iron of the siderolite encloses the following

minerals :  troilite, asmanite,  bronzite, and chromite                                                                                                      the metallic portion

    The iron sulphide, regarded as troilite, when in the form of pieces is
not acted upon by the magnet, and when in the form of powder but
feebly so. The ratios of iron to sulphur in troilite or iron monosulphite,

and in magnetic pyrites, differ in so small a degree that the analytical
results do not always put the question at rest. It is moreover a question
whether the meteoric sulphide, associated as it is with nickel-iron, does
not actually contain some of the metal as an ingredient. The numbers

obtained in these analyses are as follows :

    As regards the crystalline form of this mineral, Weisbach considers
that the recent researches of Schuster and of Von Lasaulx, have placed
almost beyond any doubt the identity of tridymite and asmanite. It oc-
curred to the author that the relative solubility of tridymite and asmanite

                                 1 By difference.

in potash solution should be determined, and in as nearly parallel ex-
periments as it was possible to devise, it was found that of tridymite from
Siebenbiirgen 49"63 parts, and of asmanite from Rittersgriin 43 - 88 parts
were dissolved.

     The bronzite, the most prominent of the non-metallic minerals, has
been obtained in a pure form with comparative ease. It is but slightly
affected by the blowpipe, and is not acted upon by acids with the excep-
tion of hydrogen fluoride. Its specific gravity is 3 - 310. It possesses the

and without a trace of the radiated structure. The ' breast-side ' is free

from all great depressions, while the others show them, due probably in

part to the original form of the stone, partly to the action of currents of

air on the melting surface. The freshly broken surface of the stone is

dull ash-grey in hue, darker than the Pultnsk stones, the texture finer

and more sharply marked than in the case of most of the chondrites.

We see many small dull grey or dark-coloured chondra, and splinters

and fragments of the same kind, many larger dull grey chondra, also

white small chondra and white fragments, the latter far fewer than the

former. Between them an ash-grey earthy matrix, and very few yellow

metallic lustrous particles. Most of the dark chondra are less than

1 mm. in diameter, those which have a diameter of 1 mm. are fewer, and
there are occasional chondra which exceed 1 mm. in size ; the largest one
had a diameter of 5 mm.

The microscopic examination of the action of this material displayed

many curious features, and appears to confirm the views already expressed

by Professor Tschermak regarding the probable influences which have

taken part in the form which the chondra and other enclosures take.

Some chondra presented an appearance which has not hitherto been

observed. They have round depressions, which point to a plasticity of

the chondra during contact, as if the spherules which form the splintered

fragments had acquired their form during the act of rubbing. Others

again have projections of a rounded form, or an almost pointed end.

These chondra are the result of volcanic eruptions or explosions.

   --Olivine. Both in the matrix, and in many chondra, well- developed

crystals of olivine were met with. They have the same crystalline form

as the olivine in basalt. Many of the chondra consist of individual

crystals. Many crystals have cavities enclosing black angular grains, or

a black impregnation of the crust, or black slightly translucent spherules

or enclosures of ' glass ' ; some exhibit a most distinct surface of the

--enclosed material.
     Bronzite. Barred and fibrous individuals of a brown colour are re-

garded as bronzite. Some of the barred chondra shown in the plate

accompanying the paper of Makowsky and Tschermak are very perfectly

developed and very curious. Some have a darker border, others a lighter

rim. In these chondra also the enclosed material already referred to is

met with.

  --Enstatite. Many of the chondra of this mineral are distinguished by

their marked foliated structure, and specimens of such are shown in the

plates. The enclosed ' glass ' is also found in them. Many spherules,

and fragments of spherules, of a crystallised mixture of bronzite and

olivine or of enstatite and olivine were noticed, none however of a

crystallised mixture of bronzite and enstatite, and it appears therefore

as if this meteoric tuff originated from two sorts of stony mixtures.
--AAugite.
            few small chondra with a compact pale-coloured crust have

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. David Gill, Professor

   G-. Forbes, Mr. Howard Grubb, and Mr. C. H. Gimingham,
   (with potuer to add to their number), appointed to consider the

    question of Improvements in Astronomical Clocks.

     This was only a preliminary Report, and at Mr. Gimingham's request
its publication is delayed until next year. [Ed.]

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor G. Forbes (Secre-

   tary), Professor W. G. Adams, and Mr. W. E. Atrton, appointed
   for the purpose of improving an Instrument for detecting the

   presence of Fire-damp in Mines.

This instrument is intended to measure the quantity of fire-damp in a

coal mine. From the rough model shown by Professor George Forbes
last year, the Committee have constructed two new instruments, which
appear to them to answer their purpose quite well. The one is of a large
size, and is worked by an electric battery, and is rather expensive. The

other is small, portable, easily worked, and answers all the purposes for
which it is required. Both instruments are founded upon the facts, that
sound travels quicker in light gases than in dense ones, and that air which
is contaminated with fire-damp is lighter than pure air. The velocity of
sound in different qualities of air is compared by noting the lengths which
must be given to a brass tube to cause it to resound to a tuning-fork.
The length of tube is proportional to the velocity of sound. The instru-
ment consists essentially of a tube with a tuning-fork at one end of it,
and closed at the other end by a piston which can be moved in and out so
as to lengthen or shorten the tube. The tuning-fork is caused to sound,
and on moving the piston in and out the sound is heard to augment and
diminish according to the position of the piston in the tube. The piston
must be left in tbat position which gives the loudest sound. The length
of the tube under these conditions measures the velocity of sound, and
thence the percentage of fire-damp in the air.

     In the large-sized instrument the tuning-fork is kept in vibration by
an electric current which is made and broken in each vibration acting on
an electromagnet so as to maintain the vibrations. The Committee
have been unable to arrange the contacts in such a manner as to prevent
the occurrence of a false note of considerable loudness. But in spite of
this the ear can detect the true note and regulate the position of the

132 REPORT-- 1879.

piston with even greater accuracy than when the tuning-fork is otherwise
set in vibration. The reason is, that in other cases there is an irregularity

in the loudness of the sound which alters slightly the velocity of the

sound.

     In the small-sized instrument the tuning-fork is set in vibration by

means of a striker or rod, which is drawn by the hand between the prongs

Aof the tuning-fork (which approach each other at their extremities).

little practice enables anyone to obtain in all cases the same loudness of
sound. The Committee have added to this instrument a circular scale
along which an index travels, being moved by a rack on the piston so

arranged that it cannot give a false indication. By this means the length

of tube can be read off easily, even in a bad light. In its present form

the instrument is easy of use and convenient, and cannot easily get out
Aof order.
             thermometer is attached by means of which the small

temperature correction can be applied. The percentage of fire-damp is
read off directly upon the scale.

     The accuracy of the instrument is such that the percentage of fire-
damp can be determined with an error of considerably less than one per
cent. The Committee would draw attention to experiments described in

the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for April 1879, which show that a difference

of one part in 300 is not found between different observations of the

length of tube which resounds to a given tuning-fork.

    On August 25, 1879, the Committee were enabled to descend the

Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery by the kindness of the manager, Mr. George

Walker, who accompanied them, with a few other gentlemen interested in

the experiments. This pit is at a depth of 200 yards. Mr. Walker had

kindly arranged to stop the ventilation of the pit at the end of the

workings, so after proceeding a mile through the galleries they came to
this spot, where they hoped to find a large amount of fire-damp. But

only a slight quantity was to be found the Davy lamp generally showing
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

but a feeble blue cap, and the Forbes' indicator registering only small

percentages. Disappointed here, they were taken by Mr. Walker to

another working, where it was thought possible that there might be some
gas. Here in a crevice in the roof a flow of gas was found forming a
stratum of light gas. Here the instrument indicated quantities gradually

increasing from 14 per cent, as the tube got filled with the air in the
crevice, up to 28 per cent. But the small quantity of gas rendered this
experiment unsatisfactory, and the Committee were then taken to a

disused part of the mine where it was known that there was a blower.

Here sufficient quantities were found, and the instrument registered gas
with more readiness than the Davy lamp. But the greatest quantity

registered was 6 per cent., or twelve times the smallest quantity which

the indicator detects. The fact is that there is in the present form of the

instrument a difficulty in filling the tube with the air of the place under
examination. The Committee consider that it would be well to alter the

instrument so as to obviate this difficulty ; and they also recommend that
experiments should be made to test whether the calculated percentages of

fire-damp agree with actual experiment. They have also to report that

the instrument was of a convenient form so as to be portable, and was

very consistent in its indications, and they can assert that this instru-
ment is capable of detecting and measuring fire-damp even in small

quantities.
ON THE CHEMISTRY OF SOME OF THE LESSEE-KNOWN ALKALOIDS. 133

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. W. Chandler Roberts,

   F.R.S. (Secretary), Dr. C. R. Alder Wright, and Mr. A. P. Luff,

   appointed for the purpose'of investigating the Chemistry of

   some of the lesser-knoivn Alkaloids, especially Veratria and

    Bebeerine.

Since last year investigations have been made on the alkaloids contained

in Veratrum album, and V. viride, with the following general results. As

the details of the experiments have already been communicated to the

Chemical Society in two papers (' Journal of the Chemical Society,'

1879, i. pp. 405 and 421), it is unnecessary to quote them here.
     Each kind of root was treated by the process described in last year's

Report, viz., percolating with alcohol acidulated with tartaric acid,

evaporating to a small bulk, treating with water to precipitate resin,

filtering, alkalising with soda, and repeatedly shaking with a large bulk

of ether, the ethereal solutions of alkaloids, &c, thus obtained being

agitated with aqueous tartaric acid to remove the bases and then used

over again. In each case a certain amount of flocculent alkaloidal mat-

ter was left undissolved by the ether, consisting mainly of an alkaloid

analogous to jervine, but differing therefrom in certain respects, to which

accordingly the name Pseudojervine is applied. The solutions of tartrates

of alkaloids obtained were treated with soda and about an equal bulk of

ether, whereby a large portion of the bases was dissolved in each case,

but some left undissolved, especially with the V. album product ; this

insoluble matter contained pseudojervine, together with a little jervine,

and in the case of the V. album product, a large quantity of an

uncrystallisable base sparingly soluble in ether, to which the term

Veratralbine is applied, as this body does not seem to be present in

V. viride roots in any considerable proportion. The second ethereal

solutions thus obtained deposited in each case crystals of jervine and a

little of a new base to which the term Rubijervine is applied ; the mother
liquors of these crystals dried up to varnish-like masses, which were not

identical in the two cases ; the product from V. album roots consisted

essentially of veratralbine, with a minute quantity of an alkaloid forming

veratric  acid on  saponification with alcoholic  potash                                  this  base was the
                                                                                       ;

was the veratrine obtainable from V. sabadilla seeds, as described in last

year's Report, inasmuch as the mixture of this base and veratralbine

obtained was powerfully sternutatory, whilst the peculiar tendency to

provoke sneezing was lost on treatment with alcoholic potash (neither

jervine, pseudojervine, rubijervine, nor veratralbine produces sneezing).
The product from the V. viride roots was even more powerfully sternu-

tatory than that from the V. album roots ; it consisted, however, almost
wholly of Cevadine (the second crystallisable alkaloid obtainable from

V. sabadilla seeds, as described in last year's Report), not more than

traces of either veratralbine or veratrine being contained ; on saponifica-
tion it yielded about the theoretical quantity of cevadic acid (the

methyl-crotonic acid of Frankland and Duppa, identical with the tiglic acid

of Geuther).

   neux, D. Mackintosh, E. H. Tiddeman, J. E. Lee, and J. Plant,
   and Dr. Deane, appointed for the purpose of recording the
   position, height above the sea, lithological characters, size and
   origin of the Erratic Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland,
   reporting other matters of interest connected ivith the same, and
   taking measures for their preservation. Drawn up by the Rev.
   H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

During the past year several contributions of interest and importance
have been received respecting the position and distribution of Erratic

Blocks.

    Mr. Townshend M. Hall, E.G.S., reports the finding of a boulder (May
1879) in cutting a drain in the village of Bickington, parish of Frem-

ington, beneath the turnpike-road leading from Barnstaple to Bideford,

at a point two miles W. by S. of Barnstaple. Its dimensions are 3 X 2'5 X 2

feet. It is rounded and smooth on the sides and under surfaces. The
upper face is rough, having apparently been broken away in making the
road. It is doubtful whether there are any ruts, groovings, or striations,
the under surface having been only felt and not seen. It is composed of
fine-grained granite, and there is no similar rock nearer than Lundy
Island, 25 miles W.N.W. from the boulder, and Dartmoor, 25 miles S.
by E. Its height above the sea is about 80 feet. It is not indicated on
any map. The larger portion still lies buried under the road, one end
having been broken away to make room for the drain. It is situated in
a bed of high-level gravels, with red sand and clay, resting upon car-
boniferous grits and shales.

     The occurrence of this boulder (Mr. Hall remarks) is of special im-
portance in connection with the still larger one at Santon (described in

the first Report of this Committee, British Association Reports, 1873,
p. 193), from which it is distant 6^ miles S.E. by E.

     The Bickington drain was cut in places to a depth of 1\ feet without
reaching the bottom of the gravel bed. Amongst the larger pebbles
associated with it, two of similar granite were found, well smoothed, and

measuring 7x5 inches.

136 report-- 1879.

In a cutting of the new Hales Owen Railway, passing through Frankley

Hill, the following section has been exposed :

                   Permian clay.

                   Sand of clay texture.

                   Yellowish sand.

                   Greyish sandy clay, with Biinter pebbles.

                   Clay, somewhat sandy.

The heights of these various beds are very irregular throughout the

section, which is in itself about 60 feet in depth.

The Permian sandstone is exposed at one point in the section, and

fragments of it are scattered through the sands and clays.

Erratic blocks are rare in the sands and clays of the cutting itself;

one only, indeed, a greenstone, was noticed at the time of our visit,

although doubtless they occasionally occur.

    No part of this section can be called a boulder clay, if by boulder

clay be meant either a clay formed beneath land ice, or a clay carried

away by an iceberg and deposited over the sea-bottom as the berg melted

or stranded.

The various sands and gravels present all the appearances of a ' wash

from older beds, effected during the depression and subsequent upheaval

of the present land surface. They are neither compactly crowded with

erratics, nor are any grooved and striated fragments of local rock heaped

irregularly together. The way in which the pieces of native rock are

scattered through the beds does not indicate any other force than that

which would be exerted by the ordinary wash of the waters during the

movements just mentioned. The presence of a few erratics shows that the

wash must have taken place beneath the waters of a glacial sea over which

icebergs floated.

These beds appear to have been formed in the earlier rather than the

later part of the glacial epoch. In a field on the summit of the section a
large number of erratics are to be seen which have been taken from a

recent surface drain. These erratics constitute a group of allied rocks

evidently from one district. Among those observed (undoubtedly, how-

ever, a large number must still be concealed beneath the soil) twenty were

felsites, two were basalts, one was a piece of varied quartz, and another a

Welsh diabase.

Professor T. G. Bonney makes the following remarks upon these

boulders :

' The basalts are very little if at all decomposed, such as might have

come from one of the basalts of post-carboniferous but pre-triassic age

at Rowley, Pouk Hill, or the Clee Hill. There is no reason, however, for

assigning them to the first or    second of these localities                                                                                                             with the third I
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

am not familiar. The " greenstone " is remarkably like several that I have

seen in Wales as, for example, in the vicinity of the northern end of Llyn

Padarn, from which locality, however, it is not likely to have come. If

examined microscopically it would doubtless be found to be composed of

a triclinic felspar augite and possibly olivine with some chlorite. Thus

it may be called a diabase. The felsites have a considerable semblance

one to another. They are of a greyish colour, weathering to a paler tint.

They present occasionally indications of fluidal structure and flow

brecciation, some looking rather slaggy as if from the outer part of a

flow, and I think they have been derived from this and not from an

intrusive boss. I feel certain they are from Wales, and are of Lower
ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 137

Silurian age, but whether from the interbedded volcanic rocks of the

Llandeilo or the Bala series I am not sure. One would expect them to
come from the Arenig district. I have seen nothing like them in the

Lake District.'

Two of the felsites are of considerable size, the larger being

4x4x2 feet.

Similar blocks may be traced almost to the summit of the hill. One

Yewfelsitic block opposite the  Trees is 4- 5 x 3 X 2 feet.

The height of these boulders above the sea is remarkable for the dis-

trict, their highest level being about 750 feet. This fact indicates a

corresponding depi'ession of the land, since no Welsh glacier could have
travelled over hill and down dale to this summit level. To render any-
such glacier work conceivable, the Welsh mountains must have stood at

a height beyond any point for which there is the slightest evidence.
     This group of boulders on the summit of Frankley Hill appears to

have been dropped by an iceberg travelling from Wales, upon the top of
the clays and sands exposed in the railway cutting, at a time when the

land was depressed at least to the extent of at least 800 to 1,000 feet.

In the clays and sands upon which the summit group of erratics rest, we

must have beds belonging to an earlier date than the close of the glacial
epoch, and the erratics in the cutting must be discriminated from those

--left at the higher level.
     Staffordshire. The following among the innumerable erratic blocks

scattered over the central part of the midland district deserve a special

record in addition to those described in previous Reports.

    A1. boulder of felsite in the brickyard at the bottom of Oak Street,

Wolverhampton.

    This boulder is of an oblong form, and measures 11x3x3 feet for a

considerable portion of its length, although tapering in a somewhat

irregular manner towards its ends. On the upper surface are rude and

rough groovings running in all directions, and doubtless produced by
the plough ; but one of the sides exposed is flat and smooth, and is

covered with parallel stria?, affording an extremely fine example of glacial

action.

    The clay by which it is surrounded contains many more or less

rounded pieces of granite, as well as of felsite, flints, together with

quartzite and other pebbles from the Biinter beds.

     The large felsite ice-marked boulder described was probably dropped
upon the clay in which it rests, this clay itself being composed of the
material brought by one of the earlier icebergs and intermixed with
material of more local origin by the currents prevalent during the move-

ments of the sea-bottom at a later period.

     In the immediate neighbourhood is a surface boulder of granite

measuring 3 x 35 X 2 feet. The grouping of these surface boulders needs

to be carefully observed, as distinguished from the accumulation of blocks

of all kinds, in the sands and clays upon which they rest, or into the

heart of which they have fallen.

    2. An erratic block of slate, situated in a field near the Fox Inn, on

the road to Trescott.

     This block has split into two pieces, the larger piece measuring

11-25 x 3-25x3-5 feet, and the smaller 9-25x3x3 feet. It originally

rested upon the surface, but some years ago it was buried, in order to

utilize the land for agricultural purposes. An excavation was recently

made (at the instance of the Dudley and Midland Geological Society)

that it might be examined.
      This is the largest erratic block of slate that has yet been seen in the

district, and it is associated with very numerous boulders of granite and

felsite.

     3. Mr. E. B. Marten has called attention to a boulder recently dis-
covered by Mr. Beale in a watercourse running nearly due N. and S.
near Moseley Hole, and the Wolverhampton, Willenhall, and Walsall
turnpike-road, and an accommodation road across the collieries from the
Osier Bed Furnaces and Slow Lane, to Bilston. It is in the line of the
third ' h,' in the words ' Stow Heath Furnace,' and the letter ' P,' of

' The Plough ' on the one-inch Ordnance Map, No. 62, S. W. Lichfield.

     The boulder is composed of granite, and measures about 4' 75 feet
every way. Its weight is probably about three tons. Its shape is sub-
angular, the angles being, with one exception, slightly rounded, but this
exception is as sharp and clean as though the block had just been detached
from its parent rock. The soil in which the boulder occurs is of a
gravelly and sandy nature, containing some pebbles bearing the well-
known indentations peculiar to, and characteristic of, the pebble beds of
Biinter. Its height is 420 feet above the sea-level.

     4. At Manor Green, half-a-mile S. of Walsall, in a field near the Old
West Bromwich road, a block of felsite stands erect, like a pillar. It
measures 4- 5 x 4'5 x 2 feet.

      Mr. L\ Mackintosh reports on the origin of the so-called 'green-
stone M boulders around the estuaries of the Mersey and the Dee (the
occurrence of which has previously been recorded in these Reports by
Mr. G. Morton, F.G.S.), to the following effect

     While tracing Criffel boulders southwards, he has observed 'green-
stone' (or as they are locally called, ' whinstone') boulders and pebbles
apparently on their way south, along with the granite on the west coast

of Cumberland, N. of Whitehaven. Between the Scottish and Cum-

brian coasts and the peninsula of Wirral (between the estuaries of the
Mersey and the Dee) the course of these boulders is lost under the Irish
Sea. The area around the Mersey estuaries in which the boulders are

very much concentrated is intensely striated, and nearly all the striae
point divergently to the S. of Scotland, i.e. between N. 15° W. and N.

45° W.
     On the most extensively glaciated rock surface (successively exposed

and demolished by quarrying operations near St. James' Church,

Birkenhead), the larger grooves point to between 25° and 30° W. of N.

    A large ' greenstone ' boulder has been found at Crosby, near Liver-

 pool, resting on a perfectly flat glaciated rock-surface with strias pointing

N. 40° W.

       Additional presumptions in favour of the Scottish derivation of these

boulders may be found (1) in the fact that nearly all of these boulders

 consist of basic rocks similar to some at least found in the S. of Scotland

 locally limited to the peninsula of Wirral and the neighbouring part of

 from widely different points of the compass, while it is as probable as the

      1 The word ' greenstone ' is retained in the text because the boulders have fre-
 quently been described under this name. It is, however, inaccurate. Most of the

 boulders in question are dolorites or diorites.

nature of the subject will admit that there is no single locality from which

they could have been derived excepting the S. of Scotland.

Many fresh ' greenstone ' boulders have been lately exposed in the

newest Bootle Dock excavation. The largest is 6 X 45 X 3 feet, and was
Afound on the surface of the upper boulder clay.
                                                  very large proportion

of the boulders are excessively flattened and regularly grooved. One

has been removed to the inner end of the passage between the Liverpool

Free Library and the Picton reading-room. Three feet in diameter of its

surface are perfectly flattened and indented with deep parallel grooves

like a work of art.

It is a remarkable fact that in the Bootle Dock excavations the ' green-

stone ' boulders are accompanied by very little  Scotch  granite                                    while on
                                                                                                 ;

the shore of the Dee estuary between West Kirby and Parkgate similar

boulders are associated with much Scotch granite. It is also remarkable

(and equally difficult to explain) that whilst at Bootle the boulders are

intensely glaciated on the shore of the Dee estuary, scarcely any of them

show signs of ice- action.

6x4x3The largest boulder on the shore of the Dee estuary is                                         feet,

and is apparently a diorite.

Mr. J. R. Dakyns favours the Committee with the following Report
   on the Shap Granite Boulders on the Yorkshire Coast :

                     Shap Granite Boulders on the Yorkshire Coast.

     I have examined this coast from Cloughton Wyke, 4 miles north of

Scarborough, to the Talbot Hotel, 6 miles south of Hornsea, a distance

of about 46 miles.
     The boulders of Shap granite are not found indifferently on any part

of the coast, but they occur plentifully at certain parts, and are entirely

wanting along the rest of the coast.
     Within the space examined they occur principally in four localities, as

follows, beginning from the north : there are several, four at least, at

Long Nab, on the north side of the Nab ; one of these measm-es 8 cubic
feet ; there are also several, six or seven at least, at Cromer Point, also on

the north side of the point.

     South of Cromer Point there are none till you come nearly to Filey.
There is one large one, measuring nearly 3 x 2J X 2 feet, on the top of the
cliff about a mile from Filey ; this is at the third fence north of the notice

' No Road' near the Spa ; it bears N. 15° E. from Filey Station. It is

probably practically undisturbed, for the ground slopes inland from the
cliff, and therefore if it has been turned up in ploughing and moved, it
cannot have been moved far, for no one would take the trouble to cart a
huge boulder far uphill. This is the only undisturbed boulder of Shap
granite that I have seen on the land ; all the others are on the shore, and
have fallen out of the cliff above them. There are several on the shore
along the north part of Filey Bay, but none along the south, nor are any
more to be met with going south till one reaches Flamborough Head.

     There are several on the shore between Flamborough Head and Flam-
borough South Landing. Some of these are large, one measuring 36 cubic

 feet.

      South of this locality, the only one I have seen on the shore, is a
small one rather more than a mile south of Bridlington Quay. But I do
not doubt that they do occur farther south occasionally, because there is

 one built into a wall at Hornsea.

--140 REPORT 1879.

   --Note. In the British Association Report for 1874, p. 196, the

Hitching stone (Yorkshire) is described as an erratic block. Mr. Dakyns
cannot think that this is correct, and writes the following note
upon it

      ' The stone is a block of millstone grit, standing on the escarpment of
a bed of grit not dissimilar in character. I believe this stone to be a

portion of this bed remaining in place, the immediately surrounding part

having been denuded. The stone is standing, as it might have stood
originally in its bed. It is angular, and bounded by joint surfaces just as
it would be on the removal of the surrounding block.

      ' In brief, it has no single characteristic of a boulder about it. It is not

rounded nor scratched, nor is it standing on end, nor in any such a way as
to raise a suspicion of its having been moved. Nor is it of a different
character from the rock on which it stands, and there are no other
boulders connected with it ; nor are there anywhere in that country any
boulders that are not mere pigmies beside it ; nor do I know of any
boulders in the country saving such as are actually embedded in drift, and

none of these are lai'ge.'

   pose of exploring Kent's Cavern, Devonshire.

     Your Committee, in this their Fifteenth Annual Report, on taking up
the narrative of their researches at the point at which it was dropped in

their Fourteenth Report, read during the meeting in Dublin in August,
1878 (see Report, British Association, 1878, pp. 124-129), beg to state
that, during the twelve months which have since elapsed, the work has
been continuously carried on in the same manner and under the same

daily superintendence as heretofore, and that the workmen named last

-- --year George Smerdon (foreman) and William Matthews have con-

tinued to perform the manual labour throughout the year to the full

satisfaction of the Superintendents.

   --Visitors. The Superintendents have had the pleasure, as in previous

years, of admitting and conducting numerous ladies and gentlemen into
the Cavern, and have availed themselves of such opportunities of stating
and explaining the principal discoveries made from time to time, as well
as their palasontological and anthropological bearings. The following

--may be mentioned as amongst the visitors thus admitted : The Princes

Edward and George of Wales, with their tutor, the Rev. J. N. Dalton

  --Living Animals still frequenting the Cavern. As in previous years, the

workmen have frequently seen rats in the innermost recesses of the
Cavern, and during the twelve months eleven were taken in a gin placed

on a rock at the remotest point of the ' Cave of Inscriptions,' fully 380

feet from open day. It may probably be presumed that they were at-

tracted by the droppings of the workmen's candles.

  --The High Chamber. When the Fourteenth Report was closed (July

31, 1878), the workmen were engaged in excavating the deposits in a
branch of the Cavern termed the ' High Chamber,' into which they had

then penetrated about thirty feet from its entrance, that is, its junction
with the Cave of Inscriptions, out of which it opens (see Report, British
Association, 1878, p. 128). This work was continued without intermission

until its completion on January 9, 1879, when the High Chamber was

found to extend in a north-westerly direction for a distance of about
53 feet, to vary in width from 5 to 10 feet, and in height from 14 feet

at the outer to 8 feet at the inner end, the measurements being made for
the width at the top of the mechanical deposit, and for the height from

the roof to the bottom of the excavation, which, however, did not reach a

limestone bottom.

     At its inner or north-western end the High Chamber sends off two
branches, one towards the north and the other towards the south. The
northern branch was excavated for a distance of 12 feet, where, though
the end was not reached, the work was abandoned, for the deposit

--breccia, blocks of limestone, and crystalline stalagmite reached the

roof, and was so compact as to bar all further progress, except by the
expenditure of a very large amount of time and money. This branch,

which varied from 5 to 7 feet wide, may be regarded as a portion of the

High Chamber. How far it extends, and whither it leads, are questions

for speculation merely.

     The exploration of the southern branch presented fewer difficulties,
and was much more successful. This branch will be subsequently de-

scribed under the name of the ' Swallow Gallery.'

     The roof of the High Chamber throughout the outermost half of its
length shows distinct traces of the long-continued action of running
water, but beyond that distance it has an angular and less ancient aspect,

due, no doubt, to the comparatively recent fall of the masses of limestone

which occupied the floor, whilst at the inner end it was much shivered.
--142 report 1879.

Indeed, the workmen had to dislodge one large mass of rock which

appeared very insecure and threatened to fall.
     The mechanical deposit found in the High Chamber was exclusively

Breccia, the oldest the Cavern has yielded. It was covered with the

crystalline, or most ancient, Stalagmite over a considerable area (see

Report, British Association, 1878, p. 128), but elsewhere it lay immedi-

ately beneath the large masses of limestone already mentioned or was
without covering of any kind. Its upper surface, ascending continuously

from the entrance of the Chamber, reached near the inner end a level

about 7 feet above that of the Breccia in the adjacent Cave of Inscrip-

tions. From this point it rose at a comparatively steep gradient over a

series of limestone terraces or steps, and beneath a well-defined sheet of
Stalagmite, until it reached the roof, where the two deposits occupied

and completely filled a ' swallow hole ' in the north-western corner of the

Chamber.
    After the Fourteenth Report was drawn the High Chamber yielded

forty-one ' finds,' of which sixteen were either lying on the surface

without any covering or were within a foot of it ; four were in the second

foot-level below the surface ; eight in the third foot-level ; and thirteen in
the fourth, the lowest excavated. Eight of the ' finds ' consisted of arti-

ficial objects only, whilst the remaining thirty- three were almost exclu-

sively relics of mammals, and included thirty teeth of bear and one of

fox, together with a considerable number of bones and pieces of bone.
     At least some of the objects lying on the surface had no claim what-

ever to antiquity. Thus, on September 23, 1878, there were found

(' find ' No. 7,214) on the exposed surface of the Breccia, where it con-
tained an unusual amount of very fine sand, a large number of quill-like

tubes of stalactite, and with them a portion of the stem of a clay tobacco-

pipe. The whole, including the sand on which they lay, had the appear-

ance of having been washed to the spot they occupied, probably during a
period of protracted and heavy rains, when the drip from the roof would

be unusually copious.

Again, on October 22, 1878, a one-bladed penknife ('find' 7,222)

was met with on the unprotected surface of the Breccia, without any

object of interest near it.

    The presence of these recent articles is in no way surprising, and

presents no chronological difficulty, as there was nothing to prevent an

adventurous visitor from reaching the spots where they were found ; and

it cannot be doubted that some such person lost the penknife, and that a

smoker threw away a portion of the tobacco-pipe he had unfortunately

broken.

    Many of the teeth of bear occupied jaws or portions of jaws. They

were most prevalent in the lowest level ; there being four specimens in

the uppermost or first foot-level ;  five  in  the  second                                  four in  the  third
                                                                                         ;                                         ;

and seventeen in the fourth or lowest. Though many of them were fine

specimens, none call for detailed description or special remark. It may

suffice to direct attention to the ' find ' No. 7,245, met with on Novem-

ber 13, 1878, in the first foot-level, and consisting of an almost entire
right lower jaw of Bear, a portion of a left lower jaw, also of Bear, and

one bone. The right jaw contained the canine tooth only, and appears

to have been crushed after its deposition. The fragment of left jaw was

that of an immature animal, and contained one molar.

The artificial objects met with, in addition to the stem of tobacco-pipe

aud the penknife, mentioned already, were flakes and chips of flint and
chert, of which there were nine :

     No. 7,207, found, with one tooth of Bear, in the fourth foot-level,
August 8, 1878.

     No. 7,211, found, with one tooth of Bear and one bone, in the fourth
foot-level, September 18, 1878.

      No. 7,219, found, with one piece of bone, in the fourth foot-level,
October 5, 1878.

      No. 7,220, found alone, in the fourth foot-level, October 9, 1878.
      No. 7,224, found alone, in the fourth foot-level, October 25, 1878.
      No. 7,225, found alone, in the third foot-level, October 29, 1878.
      No. 7,226, fonnd alone, in the fourth foot-level, October 30, 1878.

     No. 7,232, found alone, in the third foot-level, November 9, 1878.
      No. 7,256, found alone, in the fourth foot-level, January 9, 1879.
     Compared with the numerous fine implements found, from time to
time, in other parts of the Cavern, none of the specimens in the foregoing
list are in themselves of much importance or interest. They are all
more or less porous, and adhere to the tongue when applied to it.
     No. 7,211 measures l - 8 inch long and broad, and 0"4 inch in greatest
thickness. Its inner face is slightly concave : whilst the outer, produced
by the dislodgment of five flakes, is convex. Its margin, elsewhere
rudely curvilineal, is on one side almost a chisel-like edge, but somewhat

broken.

     No. 7,224 is a leaf-shaped flake, bluntly pointed at one end, and
obliquely truncated at the other. The inner face is saved by the ' bulb
of percussion ' from being quite flat ; whilst the outer has a strong, nearly
central, curvilineal ridge. There appear some indications on its edges of
its having been used as a tool, and it has perhaps undergone a slight
amount of rolling. It measures 3*1 inches long, l - 8 inch in greatest

breadth, and 07 inch in greatest thickness.

     No. 7,232 is rudely rhombohedral in form. The inner face is slightly
concave, and has a ' bulb of percussion ; ' the outer is convex, and formed
by the dislodgment of three flakes, leaving as many parallel longitudinal
areas, the central one being broad compared with those on each side of it.
This specimen may also perhaps have been slightly rolled.

       Including those reported last year (Report, British Association, 1878,

pp. 128-9) the ' finds ' met with in the High Chamber amounted to
ninety-four in number, and contained 119 teeth of Bear, one tooth of
Horse, one of Fox, numerous bones and bone-fragments, one flint nodule
tool, eleven flakes and chips of chert and flint, and one quartzite pebble.

     Tour Committee remarked last year that the flint specimens occurred
 in the third and fourth foot-levels only (op. cit., p. 129). It will be seen
 from the list given above that this was also the fact with regard to the

 similar specimens found since. In short, of the twelve specimens of flint

 and chert found from first to last in the High Chamber, none occurred in
 the first or second foot-levels, four were met with in the third level, and
 eight in the fourth, or lowest foot-level, to which the excavation was

 carried.

   --The Sivallmv Gallery. The branch thrown off towards the south from

 the inner end of the High Chamber, as stated above, has a total length
 of about 50 feet, and consists of two Reaches, the first extending south-
 wards about 26 feet, where the Gallery turns sharply eastward, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

--144 REPORT 1879.

extends in that direction about 24 feet. The width varies from 10 to 2-6
feet ; and the height, from 6 feet, at the entrance, to 8 feet at the inner

end.

      Judging from its roof, this Gallery was, during a long period, a-tunnel
completely filled with running water ; and this is confirmed by the cha-
racter of the walls, on which, however, indications of corrosion, subsequent
to the erosion, are numerous and well-marked.

     About 18 feet from the entrance of the first Reach, a considerable
irregularly-cylindrical ' Swallow Hole ' extends obliquely upwards into
the roof, and is quite empty for a height of about 7 feet, above which it
is completely filled with typical Breccia and Stalagmite. The Gallery
takes its name from this hale.

     The deposit occupying this gallery was everywhere the Breccia, having
no continuous stalagmitic covering until within the innermost 10 feet,
and even there its thickness was inconsiderable. The upper surface of
the Breccia had a uniform fall, amounting to a total of 38 inches, from
the outer to the inner end of the Gallery, where it plnnged rapidly into,
and completely filled, a tunnel ; and, being mixed with large masses of

limestone, the work in that direction was abandoned on May 24, 1879,

the exploration of the Swallow Gallery having occupied about nineteen
weeks.

     This branch of the Cavern, the two Reaches included, presented fifty-
eight ' finds,' of which thirty- three were on the surface of the Breccia or
not more than a foot below it ; fourteen were in the second foot-level
seven in the third ; and four in the fourth. In the innermost six feet of
the second Reach the sections were cut to a depth of 5 feet, instead of the
customary 4 feet, but nothing was met with in any of the fifth foot-levels.
The 'finds ' included ninety- four teeth of Bear (many of them in pieces of
jaw), four of Fox (in two pieces of jaw), one of Horse, one of Sheep, a very

lai-ge quantity of bones (many of them much broken), one chert nodule,
and three chips and flakes of chert and flint. The ' finds ' were almost

equally numerous in the two Reaches, but those in the second or inner
Reach were comparatively very rich in specimens : thus, whilst the
twenty-eight ' finds ' in the first Reach contained in all no more than
twenty teeth of bear, a single 'find' (No. 7,304) in the second Reach,
contained also twenty teeth of bear and bones enough to fill a wheelbarrow,
and the thirty ' finds ' of this Reach yielded a total of seventy-four teeth

of Bear.

     The ' find ' No. 7,297, consisting of bones and pieces of bone, met with
in the second foot-level, on April 14, 1879, contained the proximal end of
a left tibia, having on it at least five grooves or scores of different depths,
and some of them having within them finer scores, parallel to their sides.

When inspected with a lens, the surface of the bone showed several finer
lines in various directions. As it may be doubted whether the scores

were the teeth-marks of any animal, their origin is problematical.

    Here again it may be remarked that several specimens lying on tho

surface of the Breccia, without covering of any kind, do not certainly or
probably all belong to the era of that deposit. Indeed, the tooth of
Sheep already mentioned, and a few bones belonging to the same ' find '
(No. 7,261) are not only open to this cautionary remark, but from their
aspect and mineral condition, belong, without doubt, to very recent times.

The same may perhaps be said of the tooth of the Horse (No. 7,298),

which lay also on the unprotected surface.
         ON THE EXPLORATION OF KENT'S CAVERN, DEVONSHIRE.                                                           145

     The specimens of flint and chert found in the Swallow Gallery are
not entitled to more than a mere enumeration.

     No. 7,260, a chert nodule, apparently never utilised in any way, was
found alone in the third foot-level, January 29, 1879.

     No. 7,273, a small chip or fragment of flint, was found alone, in the
third foot-level, February 22, 1879.

     No. 7,275, a small flake of flint, probably a fragment of a flake imple-
ment, was found on the surface, near a tooth of Bear and pieces of bone,

February 24, 1879.

No. 7,301, a small chip of chert, was found in the first foofc-level, with

three teeth of Bear and numerous bones, April 22, 1879.

Your Committee, when treating last year of the flint implements which

had then been found in the High Chamber, remarked, ' It is difficult to

understand how the tools found their way to a branch of the Cavern so

remote from the known entrances, and occupying so high a level. The

problem is apparently insoluble except on the hypothesis that the work-

men are  approaching  an  entrance  hitherto  unknown                                                and  as  this  sup-
                                                                                                  ;

position has been forced on the minds of the Superintendents by other and

independent facts, they believe it to be most desirable to settle this question,

if possible, as they do not doubt that it would give a definiteness to the

--explication of some of the Cavern phenomena.' (Rep. Brit. Assoc, 1878,

p. 129.)

     The Superintendents have no doubt that the researches of the last
twelve months have converted their ' hypothesis ' of 'an entrance,' or,
more correctly, of entrances, ' hitherto unknown,' into an established fact.

--They believe also that the facts prove that the said entrances the
--Swallow holes in the High Chamber and the Swallow Gallery were com-

pbtoly closed before the beginning of the ' Cave-earth ' era, and have

 jmained so to the present day.
     The entrance in the Swallow Gallery was probably never available as

a passage for any living animal ; but there can be little doubt that any
tolerably agile creature could readily have used that in the north-west
corner of the High Chamber. That the roof dividing this branch of the

Caveru from the open day is of very inconsiderable thickness is plainly
indicated by the levels, as well as by the distinctness with which all
external sounds are heard in that Chamber ; and the ' series of limestone
terraces,' mentioned already as leading up to the Swallow Hole, would

form convenient steps for a man or any infra-human animal desirous of

entering or leaving the Cavern.

   --Qliv IcJc's Gallery. Your Committee, in their Eleventh Report (1875),
     --the following statement : ' The comparative paucity of specimens

in Clinnick's Gallery induced the Superintendents, on December 1, 1874,

to suspend operations in that direction for at least a time. The labour of

seven months had been expended on it, during which the exploration had
reached 75 feet from the entrance, where the Great Chamber discovered

--by John Clinnick may be said to begin.' (Rep. Brit. Assoc, 1875,

pp. 5-6.)

    On May 24, 1879, when, as stated above, they left the Swallow
Gallery, the workmen returned to Clinnick's Gallery, the only known

branch of the Cavern the exploration of which has not been completed,

that is to the depth of four feet below the base of the Stalagmitic Floor.

     In wet weather this Gallery surpasses all other branches of the Cavern
in the amount of drip from the roof; and this, on June 16, was so very

copious, on account of the unusually heavy rainfall the preceding day, as

well as the previous saturated condition of the ground, 1 that the workmen
were wet to the skin within two hours after beginning their work.

      Since its resumption, the excavation in Clinnick's Gallery has been
steadily carried on, and is still in progress ; and at the end of July it had
advanced 27 feet beyond the seventy-five mentioned in the Eleventh

Report (1875). The deposit found there after the work was resumed
was exclusively the Breccia, the upper surface of which dipped steadily in
the direction in which the workmen advanced, and was 25 inches lower
at the point reached on July 31, than at that at which the work was
resumed in May. It was covered uniformly with Stalagmite, varying from

12 to 30 inches thick.

     The paucity of specimens mentioned in the Eleventh Report still

characterises this branch of the Cavern, for though upwards of tw

months have elapsed since the workmen returned thither, no more than

--three ' finds ' have been met with in that time a small fragment of a

Bear's jaw, with a few splinters of teeth (No. 7,314), found in the second

foot-level, on May 31, 1879, and two chert nodule tools (Nos. 7,316 and

7,317).

The chert tools, however, are of sufficient interest to repay the time

and labour spent in exhuming them. No. 7,316 is of a light drab-

coloured, granular chert, covered almost everywhere with a manganic (?)
smut, but having a considerable patch of Breccia cemented to it with

carbonate of lime. The outline of the tool is that of a trapezium with the

angles rounded. It is 5'8 inches long, 31 inches in greatest width, and

2 - 3 inches in greatest thickness. The butt-end is almost square, and

measures 1"4 inch by 1*3 inch. The tool attains its greatest thickness

about 2 inches from this end, whence it tapers on each face to an oblique

chisel-edge. The condition of the various edges is not inconsistent witl.

the supposition that the tool had been slightly rolled. It was found alont

on July 15, 1878, in the third foot-level of the Breccia.

    No. 7,317 was unfortunately broken by the workman by whom it was

found and dug out, and who, before he saw it, to use his own language,

' throw'd the pick into'n.' The surface of the fracture has a very white

chalk-like aspect, but the application of hydrochloric acid causes no

effervescence. Like the preceding tool, its surface is largely covered with

a manganic (?) smut. In form the tool may be said to be somewhat

pear-shaped. It measures 5 - 6 inches in length, 3'5 inches in greatest

width, and 2" 6 inches in greatest thickness, It was found alone on
July 25, 1879, in the second foot-level of the Breccia, within 2 fe ' - p

No. 7,316.

It is perhaps noteworthy that the only other chert tool having, like

Nos. 7,316 and 7,317, a blackened surface, which the Cavern has yielded,

was the fine specimen, No.  \4,  r,  met  with  also  in Clinnick's Gallery, and

                            (

described in the Committee's Tenth Report (Report, British Association,

1874, pp. 15-16). It was found, April 23, 1874, in the fourth foot-level
of the Breccia, and was also a nodule tool, but not quite so large as the

specimens described above.
     Clinnick's Gallery, so far as it has been explored, varies from 12 to 4

feet wide and from 7 - 5 to 11 feet high. It consists of three Reaches, of

3-01 inches, of which -97 inch fell on the 15th.

which the first or outermost extends in a northerly direction ab out 30 feet

The Gallery then turns at right angles and extends westward about 25

feet, where it again, though with some irregularity, takes a northerly

direction for 30 feet.

About 16 feet up the third or innermost Reach the explorer, by crawl-

ing up a steep sheet of stalagmite, formed on limestone rocks in situ on

the western side, and, having reached the top, by wriggling vermicularly

through a very small aperture, finds himself in a chamber from 10 to 12

feet long and broad, but not quite so high, where he soon comes to the

conclusion that there is little or no chance of finding anything of interest

to the palaeontologist or the anthropologist. The walls and roof, how-

ever, are hung with a profusion of beautifully white stalactites, many of

them in the form of long, thin, quill-like tubes, whilst others of larger

volume assume various forms, but all of great beauty. From the floor

there rises a forest of stalagmitic ' paps,' some of them nearly 2 feet high

and 10 or 12 inches in circumference, and all promising, were time

allowed, to become pillars reaching the roof. By letting himself down

over a rocky ledge, about 4 feet high, at the inner or northern end of this

chamber, the explorer enters a second chamber, about 25 feet long from

south to                         north     nearly, and     12 feet wide                                                 where, though  stalactites  and
                                                                                                                     ;

stalagmites are almost as plentiful and as beautiful as in the ante-room

he has just left, his attention is rather rivetted on the walls, and especi-

ally the roof, which are rugged, and angular, and shivered. That blocks

of limestone have in great plenty fallen from them, and in times geologi-

cally recent, there cannot be a doubt, and their aspect is anything but

calculated to inspire confidence in their present stability. Nevertheless,

judging from the stalactites depending from the roof and the ' paps '

rising from the floor, there can have been no very recent fall. The floor,
telling much the same story as the roof and walls, is made up of masses

of limestone, generally of no great size, with numerous pitfalls between

them.

On its eastern side, the third or innermost Reach of Clinnick's Gallery

opens into a large chamber, which the workmen have just begun to

explore.

--Palceontographical Society. In 1878 your Committee had the pleasure

of receiving from Professor A. Leith Adams, F.R.S., an application for

permission to have drawings taken of any relics of mammoth they had

found in the Cavern, for the purpose of illustrating the monograph on

the ' British Fossil Elephants ' which he is preparing for the Pateon to-

graphical Society of Great Britain. It must be unnecessary to add that

the permission was at once granted, and that such specimens as he wished
were forwarded to him without delay.

Professor Leith Adams has accordingly, in Part II. of his monograph

(1879), directed attention (pp. 84, 85, 86, 91, 92, 94) to fifteen milk-

molars found by the Committee in the deposit known as the Cave-earth,

and has given natural-size figures of three of them (Nos. 1,063, 5,489,

5,774                            see  pi.  ix.,  figs.  3  and 4,  and  pi.  xii.,                                      fig.  2).

148 REPORT-- 1879.
----

ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE BOENEAN CAVES.  149

Report of the Committee consisting of Mr. John Evans, Sir John
    Lubbock, Major-General Lane Fox, Mr. George Busk, Professor

   W. Boyd Dawkins, Mr. Pengellt, and Mr. A. W. Franks, ap-

    pointed for exploring certain Caves in Borneo.

 Your Committee have to report that with the grant of 50Z. from the Asso-
ciation, a similar grant from the Royal Society, and a further sum of

 about 2001. from private sources, they have been able to prosecute an
examination of various caves in Borneo, under the superintendence of

Mr. A. Hart Everett, who has devoted himself to the task for a period of

 nearly nine months.

      His final report upon his work has not yet been received, but it appears
from his letters, and from the specimens which have been transmitted to
this country, that nothing of special interest, either from an anthropo-
logical or a geological point of view, has resulted from his explorations.
The animal remains discovered have all been of recent species ; the human
bones are probably of no very great antiquity, and none of the few objects
of human manufacture which have been found can be regarded as of
palasolithic age. Pending the arrival of Mr. Everett's final report it
appears needless to enter into details, but it may be mentioned that up-
wards of twenty caves appear to have been explored in a more or less
complete manner, and the principal objects found, after examination by
some of the members of the committee, have been forwarded to the British
Museum.

     Although the examination of these caves has not, as was hoped, thrown

any light upon the early history of man in that part of the world, it is

still satisfactory that the examination should have been made, and the
character of the cave-deposits ascertained by so competent an observer as
Mr. Everett. The evidence obtained, though negative, is not without

value, and those who are specially interested in cave explorations, and who
have so liberally assisted in tbe present instance, cannot now be re-

proached with not having availed themselves of the opportunity afforded
by Mr. Everett's presence of obtaining further information as to the con-
tents of the Borneo caves.

    It may be added that though for the most part the objects secured
were unimportant, there were among the cave deposits a number of shells

of land and fresh water mollusca, which have been examined by Colonel
Godwin- Austen and have proved to belong to at least twenty-five genera
and forty species, some of which are apparently new. Mr. Everett has
been requested to devote some attention to collecting a larger series of
these shells, but owing to the difficulties of postal communication it is

possible that the request may arrive too late. Tour Committee propose

to communicate Mr. Everett's final report, together with any observations
which seem called for on the specimens which are still to arrive, to the
Royal Society.

     After the reading of the above the following letter was received from
Mr. Everett :

     Second Quarterly Report on the Bornean Cave Exploration.

                                         To J. Evans, Esq.

   --dear Sir, I beg to submit the following Rejiort of my work during

  . past three months :

--150 REPORT 1879.

  --Cave No. V. As mentioned in my first Report, I was still occupied at

Bthe date of its despatch in the examination of this cave. Excavation

was continued across the low-level chamber to its left-hand wall, where

the earth attained a thickness of about 5 feet. The contents preserved

the character already noted throughout, and they yielded no sign of

organic remains of any kind whatever. Excavation G, situated half-way

up the steep entrance talus was carried to a depth of 4 feet only. The

contents were washed, when their condition admitted of the employment

of this process, with the result that a few bones of bats and small rodents,

together with abundance of the usual land and fresh- water shells were

met with                                             but nothing to warrant an extended working until the remains
                                                  ;

Dsent from the excavation shall have been examined and reported upon.

The earth in C working became concreted just below the surface to such

a degree of hardness as to necessitate frequent blasting ; but this stony

concrete was irregularly distributed, the earth being in parts quite friable

Fdown to the bottom of the excavation. Excavation was cut into a bank

of pure guano, capped by a deposit of rotten stalagmite, about 1 foot thick.

This bank is a small local deposit of only a few yards' extent. Neither

--bones nor shells occurred here. Excavation D. I blasted out a small

portion of the hard reddish-yellow concrete lying immediately below the

ossiferous river-mud in this excavation                                                                                                                                                                         but  seeing no sign of bones, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the hole filling with water, I did not work down to the limestone floor. I

finally abandoned Cave No. V. on January 4, and transferred the work-

--men the next day to No. XIII.
     Cave XIII. This cavern consists of a simple large tunnel piercing

the Jambusan hill from side to side (or rather that spur of it known

among the Dyaks as Gunong Bak), about a quarter mile to the eastward

of Cave No. V. The entrance is about 45 feet above the level of the

plain                           and the real floor, where  the  limestone                                                                                                                                            rock  has been exposed by
                             ;

the drip about the centre of the cave, is some 10 feet lower. I enclose a

plan of the entrance hall, with one transverse and one longitudinal section

of the deposits worked through. I have already consigned you to a sample

of the ossiferous contents of the cave, together with specimens of the

various deposits it afforded. These latter, I should mention, are all much

wetter, and therefore harder and stifler, when freshly exposed than will

be apparent from their appearance when they reach you. I made no

excavations in the interior part of the cave, where I found a great thick-

ness of the usual tenacious yellow clay ; but I cut one trench just within
the entrance, and a second one somewhat in advance in it. The series of

deposits met with were as follows :

                                                     Excavation A.

-- AStratum 1.                                       narrow band (1 to 4 inches thick) of black earth full

of fragments of charcoal, broken cooking utensils, bones, &c, being the

debris left in recent years by the Dyaks, when camping in the cave for

the purpose of taking the nest-harvest. This layer was thrown aside

after very superficial scrutiny. It is noteworthy that it contains sparingly
--the shells of a marine bivalve a Cardium, I think (lot 108).
--AStratum 2.
                                                     hard stalagmitic layer (about 4 inches thick) , coloured

reddish by intermixture of clay, and containing a few land shells and

remains of bats, which, however, appear to die out in the next succeeding

stratum.

  --Stratum 3. Concreted yellow clay (8 inches to 12 inches thick), with-

out apparent stratification, and without organic remains. This stratum
is sharply defined from the preceding one ; but not so from Stratum 4, of
which it is, in fact, an integral part. Both this stratum and the preced-
ing required steady blasting throughout the excavation, and any remains
they might have contained would have been likely to escape notice unless

of large size or occurring in some abundance.

    Stratum 4.--Unstratified reddish-yellow clay, with small water-worn

gravel, and without any kind of organic remains. This stratum rested
immediately on the limestone floor, which was worn into deep longitudinal

furrows.

     The dimensions of this excavation were 23' X 6' to /', and the depth
varied to 6' in the deepest part. It was completed in six days, as it was
not necessary to follow the tedious process of washing the contents.
Section 1 coincides with the longer axis of the excavation, and it is in-
correct in one particular, i.e. it shows the black band as subjacent to the

deposit of clay marked 5, which is really below it.

mains, however, obtained from XIII., B, are more varied and in better

condition than those from Cave V.

    Stratum 3.--Unstratified yellow clay, concreted, except in its upper-

most part, into a hard stalagmitic rock. This deposit corresponds to the

strata 3 and 4 of Excavation A. It contains shells and a few bones.
Owing to the scarcity of these latter, and also to the influx of water by
underground drainage, I did not continue this trench down to the lime-

stone floor.

In this excavation it was needful to wash the whole of the river-mud

in sieves, which caused the work to be excessively slow. During the

process a small V-shaped fragment of stone, seemingly artificial, was

found. It is that marked 110 in the Catalogue. If this fragment is

considered to be undoubtedly of human workmanship, it forms the first

evidence of the co-existence of man in the district with the fauna of the
Ariver-mud horizon, and as such is not without interest.

though it is-- of the presence of the remains of mammals in the yellow

clay lying below the river-mud deposit.                                     the

Paku and Bidi districts. One of these, known as the Guah Kokan in

the Kapoh hill at Bidi, is of great size, has seemingly a considerable

thickness of deposits, and is situated at a height of upwards of 100 feet,

in the face of a perpendicular cliff. It is very large for the few men at

my command to make an adequate impression on, but I will attempt it if

no better offers within the next few days. Before the completion of the

ensuing quarter I hope to be able to report having visited the ossiferous

Sarawak, March 8, 1879.

              List of Remains, fyc, found in Sarawak Caves, Borneo.

    NO.

     1. Remains of raptorial bird (recent). Obtained from Cave No. V. at Jambusan.
             Found on the surface of the earth, at the bottom of the deep pit at the

                 farther end.

    2. Molar tooth and fragment of bone. Purchased from Chinese gold-washer.

            Found in the swampy flat of alluvium, debris of limestone, stalagmite,
             and veinstones, &c, which skirts the south-east base of the Busan hills
              between them and the village of Paku.
3, 4, 5. Teeth procured at different times by Chinese washing for gold in the same

               situations as No. 2. All purchased.
    6. Portion of jaw with teeth, apparently of wild hog, procured from the silt at

            the mouth of Cave No. VI. Originally brought from the interior when
             the cave was examined for gold.

    7. Fragments of bone found in same locality as Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5. Purchased from

               Chinese gold-washer.

    8. Seven teeth of a large deer (?), with fragment of bone. Purchased from
              Chinese gold- washer, and found in the same locality as No. 7.

   9. Human remains. Procured from Cave No. II. at Paku. Collected by

                myself. (See Report.)

  10. Remains of wild hog, apparently. Purchased from a Dyak, who stated that

              they were found far within a cavern too contracted to allow of the passage
              of a living pig, if it could have climbed the precipitous hill half-way up
             which the cave opened, which he thought impossible. Being dissatisfied
             with the price paid, he refused to show this cave.

   11. Bones and teeth purchased from a Malay gold-washer. Found in the pan in
              washing the earth in Cave No. III. Cave visited by myself. (See Report.)

  12. Human remains purchased from another Malay gold-washer. Found in Cave

             No. VIII. close to Paku, in the Busan hills, and near the mouth of the
              cave. Only slightly covered with earth.
  13. Bones and teeth purchased from Dyaks. Found within a narrow cave high

        --up on one of the hills near the Tagora road Cave No. IX. The bones

              were either on the surface of the cave earth or but slightly buried.
  14. Remains of a large Chelonian, purchased from Dyaks. Found in Cave No.

              VII. Jambusian hill, tightly wedged in a fissure of the rocky floor which
             had been laid bare of a thick bed of very tenacious clay at this spot. The
               bones seen in situ by myself.

52. Chelonian remains. Purchased from Chinese gold-workers, and found at a

           spot in the Paku flat where the contents of a cave were washed in former

               years.

53. Skull of Helarctos. Found at about 3 feet depth in a cave in Gunong Jawang.

            Bears marks of a cutting instrument.

           of adjacent caves were formerly washed for gold. Purchased.

55. Skull of Simia satyrus $. Obtained from same situation as the preceding.
           The gash cutting through the parietal and other bones on the right side
          of the cranium was probably caused by the tools of the gold-seekers when
           the skull was first exhumed. It has since been again covered with earth
           for some years. The occipital foramen bears marks of a sharp cutting
           instrument. The skull has evidently been exposed to smoke, and it might
           stand for one which has hung griming for years in the smoke of the head

           house of the Dyaks on Siranbu.

66. Cervine, molar, and other remains. Cave No. III.
57. Teeth of Simia, fragments of chelonian, &c. The Paku plat. Purchased.

           They stated that the remains occurred in a cave near the summit of one
            of the Jibong group of hills, at a long distance within the cave (' distant
            from the entrance the burning of one torch '), and from their description
            they appeared to have been laid bare by the washing of water.

    61. Cervine remains. Purchased from Dyaks, who said the bones were found in
              one of the Jambusan caves about half-way up the hill. From the Dyaks'
                description I understood that these bones had been laid bare by the drip

                over the spot where they rested.
    62. Portion of skull with two molar teeth. From a cave on the water-level in

                the Jambusan hill (No. XVI.).
    63. Bone found on the surface in the interior of Cave XIV.

   64. Two lower jaws of a carnivora in same Cave XIV., at about 18 inches' depth

                 from the surface.

   65. Two lower jaws (two halves) of Cervus. Obtained by myself in the same

                  cave as No. 62, partly embedded in calcareous earth.
    66. Teeth, apparently of wild pig. From a cave in the Jambusan hill.
    67. Skull, &c. Obtained from Dyaks, who affirmed that these remains were

                lying in a narrow oblique fissure, connecting one of the Jambusan caves

             with the top of the hill, and that the reason why some of the bones are

                stained with smoke is that the fissure opened immediately above a flat
                ledge of rock on which the Dyaks were accustomed to light their fires for
                cooking, so that the smoke escaped habitually up the fissure. I suspect
              that the smoke-coloured remains may have belonged to recent animals
               eaten by the Dyaks in the cave when taking the nest-harvest.
    68. Purchased from Chinaman. Found on a heap of gold-washers' refuse, the
                produce of a fissure at Paku, the mouth of which is situated about 50 feet
                above the water-level. Only bones found. Cave No. XVIII.
    68. Teeth. Cave at Jambusan. Obtained from Dyaks. (The number inad-

                    vertently repeated.)

. 69. Human remains brought from a cave at Ahup. Said to be about 3 fathoms

                 from the entrance, the cave being situated in the upper half of the hill.
                These bones lay on the surface, but the finder did not dig to see if any
                 were below.
    70. Remains purchased from a Malay. They occurred in a cave on the hills

                abutting on the Tagora Road. The cave is situated in the upper part
               of the hill. The fragment of jaw with teeth was found near the entrance
                the other teeth occurred at some distance within, and together ; and the
                bones in the innermost recess of the cave, which is extensive, only one rib
                 showing on the surface, and the remaining bones at depths varying up to

                  12 inches.

their labours become known, the greater inclination is shown by engineers
and contractors to furnish information, and the greater tendency is
exhibited to make available our underground water for the purposes of

consumption. And they are of opinion, that until it becomes the duty of

a Government Department to collect the various information accruing
from day to day, it is important that the Committee should be reap-
pointed, and further that their inquiry should not be limited to certain
formations, but should extend to the whole of the permeable formations
of England.

     The attention of your Reporter has been specially given since the last

meeting to the estimation of the areas of water-bearing formations in the

various river-basins, and to the extent to which they may be expected to

underlie the more impermeable clays and marls ; towards this object he
has personally examined a large area of the country, and endeavoured to
ascertain how far the rain falling in certain river-basins is carried by the
dip into other hydrographic areas. These results he is prevented laying
before you in detail through illness, brought on by a railway accident;

but the following totals may be found useful, giving the Permian and

Triassic formations in fourteen groups of the 215 river-basins of the

Ordnance Survey Catchment Basin Map :

    In the Lancashire and Cheshire plains New Red sandstones crop over

1070 square miles, which, at 10 inches' absorption, would give a daily

average yield of 428 million gallons, or a supply for eight-and-a-half mil-
lion persons at fifty gallons per head. The new boring at Bootle, carried

to a depth of 1300 feet, by Messrs. Mather and Piatt, for the Corporation

water-supply of Liverpool, reported on last year, is now completed, but
further details are deferred until pumping has determined how far the
underground yield of Liverpool is increased by this sinking. Some

doubts having been thrown on the determination of the age of the hard
coarse-grained rock, met with under the Pebble Beds at Bootle, which

your Reporter considers to be a compact variety of the Lower Mottled

sandstone, he is glad to be able to state the correctness of this opinion

is proved by a boring made for the Warrington Waterworks Company, at
Winwick, by Mr. E. Timmins, of Runcorn, which, after passing through

the base of the Pebble Beds, and a compact ' millet seed '-grained rock,

identical with that of Bootle, again entered soft, loose, red and white

sand, of the Lower Mottled sandstone type, which in its turn again rested

on the Upper Coal Measures, including a limestone probably referable to

the age of the Ardwick limestone of Manchester.

ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.

                                                Appendix B.

Report on the Water in the Triassic Sandstones at West Kirby, Cheshire.

                                     By Isaac Roberts.

Tn the year 1877 I was requested by the Hoylake Waterworks Com-
pany (then just formed) to report upon the advisability of sinking a well
on Grange Hill at West Kirby, which is distant about 1^ miles to the

south of Hoylake, with the object of obtaining a supply of water for the

inhabitants of Hoylake and West Kirby.
     On making a- careful survey of the private wells in the neighbourhood

of the proposed well, I determined the surface of the water plane in the

rock to be 30 feet above the Ordnance datum at the highest part of
Grange Hill, and 22 feet above the datum near the plain, at the foot of
the hill, and I reported that if a well were sunk at the point indicated by
the company's engineer, a point 219 feet above Ordnance datum, the
surface of the water plane would be reached about 195 feet below the
summit of Grange Hill.

     The sinking of the well was commenced about twelve months ago, and
on visiting the site on the 11th of this month (July 1879), I found the
well sunk 205 feet in depth, and the surface of the water plane 186 feet
5 inches below the point on the Grange Hill which I have already re-

ferred to, thus agreeing very closely with my calculations made in the

year 1877.

     The well on Grange Hill is distant about a mile from the river Dee,
which is the nearest outlet for the discharge of the rainfall upon the hill and
which passes through its mass into the sea. Itis therefore demonstrated that

the inclination of the water plane within the Triassic rocks of this district
does not in any case exceed 30 feet in altitude to one mile in horizontal
distance, and as the natural water level in the rocks of this district has
not hitherto been materially disturbed by pumping, the inclination of the
water plane given above will probably be, within narrow limits, the normal

in all similar rocks.

     The rock which forms Grange Hill is marked ' Pebble Beds ' of the
Bunter on the maps of the Geological Survey, but in examining the well
which is now being sunk it appears probable that an error has been made
in so naming them, for the lithological characteristics of the rocks agree
better with the base of the Keuper forming the surface of the hill, and
' upper soft red ' or ' mottled ' sandstone beneath, than with ' pebble
beds ' as marked on the maps. 1

--162 REPORT 1879.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. Maxwell Close,
   Professor W. C. Williamson, and Mr. W. H. Baily, appointed
  for the purpose of collecting and reporting on the Tertiary

    {Miocene) Flora, &c, of the Basalt of the North of Ireland.

   Drawn up by Wm. Hellier Baily, F.L.S., F.G.S. (Secretary).

The discovery of plant-remains in a deposit of brown and red bole under
a thin bed of lignite, and immediately over a thick bed of conglomeritic
or pisolitic iron ore, interstratified with the basalt of County Antrim, was
facilitated by the excavations made for extracting this valuable iron ore,

which has been found to extend over a considerable district of the North
of Ireland, having been largely worked at various places.

     The locality which has yielded the largest number of specimens is at
and close to a cutting through basalt on the Belfast and Northern Coun-
ties Railway at Ballypalady, about seven miles east of Antrim. The

section observed at that place, and supplied to me by the late G. V.
Du Noyer, District Surveyor of the Geological Survey of Ireland, was the
following, that gentleman also having sent me the first consignment of

these interesting fossils for examination :

                                          1. Basalt, 15 feet.

                                                                    Layer of brown earth, 3 inches thick.
                                                                         Layer of impure earthy lignite, 8 to

                                                                4. Bed of brown earth or bole, passing

   A notice of these plants, as well as some accompanying insect remains,

was communicated by me in 1869 to the Geological Society of London. 1

Since then I have visited the locality several times, always obtaining

fresh materials and increasing the list of species. In addition to these,
and to the use of the specimens in the collection of the Geological Survey,

I am indebted to William Gray, Esq., F.G.S. , and William Swanston,

Esq., F.G.S., of Belfast; the Rev. Dr. Grainger, of Broughshane, near
Ballymena ; to the Belfast Natural History Society ; and to the Director

of the Natural History Museum of Science and Art, Dublin, for permission

to draw and describe the specimens in their several collections.

                                         ON THE MIOCENE FLORA, ETC.               163

In working the iron ores of this district there are other localities where

beds of lignite and plant-remains have been observed, but none of them

up to the present have been found to be anything like so rich in the

remains of a fossil flora of so decided a character as the place just de-

scribed, although it would be highly desirable to investigate occasionally

places where similar excavations are being carried on.

     The existence of another very interesting fossil plant locality, evidently

of the same age, near Glenarm, was kindly communicated to me by Mr.
William Gray, who was good enough to accompany me from Belfast to

Glenarm, where, notwithstanding the severity of the weather (and it was

snowing hard at the time), we succeeded in obtaining a good number of

specimens ; the material in which they are embedded, a light grey,

laminated marl, being lithologically quite different from that of Bally-

palady, although identical species occur at both localities.

    On the east shore of Lough Neagh, at Sandy Bay, and in the bed of

Glenavy l'iver, near the same place, in drift deposits and in loose water-

worn masses, the celebrated silicified wood is found ; it is for the most

part coniferous, 1 the structure being beautifully preserved, exhibiting the

typical characters of the Cupressinse, or cypress group. The silicifi cation

in all probability was caused by water holding silica in solution, although

not by the water of Lough Neagh. The popular idea that the waters of

this lake possessed petrifying properties has been satisfactorily shown to

be fabulous, and that the lake itself in all probability did not exist at the

period when this silicification took place.

Accompanying the silicified wood on the shores of Lough Neagh are

also water- worn pebbles of fine granulated iron, which, on being broken,

disclose the impressions of plants, amongst them a fern, Hemitelites, twigs

of Sequoia Couttsice, and leaves of dicotyledonous trees in beautiful preser-

vation. Where a fresh fracture has been made, the finely reticulated

structure of the leaf is shown, and in the Sequoia the woody character of

the twig, apparently unchanged, is preserved in the cavities made by its

impression in the ironstone.

    Up to the present time I have been enabled to enumerate at least

twenty- five species from these Miocene deposits of the North of Ireland.

They are as a group most closely allied to the fossil flora of North Green-

land (described by Professor Heer in the ' Philosophical Transactions,'

1869). Some of them are certainly identical, such as Sequoia Gouttsim,

(Heer), occurring at Bovey Tracey, shores of the Baltic, and North

Greenland ; Pliragmites OEningensis (Ad. Brong) , the well-marked leaves

doubtfully referred by Heer to the family Menispermacese, and named by

him McGlintockia Lyalli and M. trinervis, the fruits or seeds of Nyssa
                                                                                                                               ;

ornithobroma and Viburnum Whymperi, together with a leaf of the latter

species                                  also leaves of Alnus, closely allied if  not identical with A. Kefer-
                                      ;

steini ; Platanus Guillehnce, and Juglans acuminata. It is also interesting

to be able to identify a fern which I believe belongs to Heer's genus

Hemitelites, species of which occurs at Bovey Tracey and North Green-

     1 Dr. Scouler, in the first volume of the Journ. Gaol. Soc. of Dublin, shows, from
the evidence of Dr. Lindley, that these masses of wood were coniferous. The Rev.
Dr. Macloskie, in a paper read at the Belfast Natural History Society, February 14,
1872, stated that they belong to the Cupressacese, and probably to the genus Sequoia,
a coniferous tree (of which the great Wellingtonia of California is a living example,
there being but two existing species, Sequoia sempervirens and S. gigantea, both
natives of California) frequent in the Miocene of the Antrim basalt, and also in the
accompanying ironstone nodules.

Filicites Hebridicus also belongs to the same genus.

ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  165

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. H. T. Barnes-
    Lawrence, Mr. Spence Bate, Mr. H. E. Dresser {Secretary), Mr.

   J. E. Harting, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, Mr. J. Gr. Shaw Lefevre,
   M.P., Professor Newton, and the Rev. Canon Tristram, appointed

    by the Council, for the purpose of inquiring into the possibility
   of establishing a Close Time for the Protection of Indigenous
    Animals.

Your Committee has gratefully to acknowledge the resolution of the
Council of the Association, whereby your Committee has been not only
reappointed but also instructed to report to the Council in case of any
action being required. Tour Committee begs leave to state that no such
emergency as was provided for by this instruction has arisen since the

presentation of its last Report. Notwithstanding complaints that are
occasionally heard, your Committee believes that public opinion continues
strongly in favour of the close time principle, as applied to indigenous

animals ; and on the part of Her Majesty's Government no steps have been
taken to carry out the recommendations of the Scottish Herring Fishery
Commissioners, upon which your Committee deemed it its duty to anim-
advert last year. The Bird Preservation Acts, though doubtless evaded
in some places, in general appear to work well, and to be enforced without
difficulty when occasion requires. Having regard to future contingencies,
your Committee ventures to solicit its reappointment with the instructions

as to reporting to the Council in case of emergency.

Report of Committee, consisting of Mr. C. Spence Bate and Mr. J.
   Brooking Rowe, appointed for the purpose of Exploring the
   Marine Zoology of Devon and Cornivall.

The exceptionally severe weather during the past winter and spring has

prevented the Committee carrying on the intended investigations, and,
although some facts of interest have been noted, it is not prepared to

report this year.

    It therefore asks that it may be re-appointed, and that the grant may

be continued.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. M. Foster, Professor
   Rolleston, Mr. Dew-Smith (Secretary), Professor Huxley, Dr.
   Carpenter, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, Mr. Sclater, Mr. F. M. Balfour,
   Sir C. Wyville Thomson, and Professor Ray Lankester, ap-
   pointed for the purpose of arranging for the occupation of a

    Table at the Zoological Station at Naples.

Since we submitted our last Report to the Association, the Zoological

Station at Naples has continued to be successful in providing opportunity
and appliances for naturalists studying the various forms of marine

animals and plants. Prom September 1, 1878, to the end of July, 1879,

166 report--1879.

Atwenty-six naturalists have occupied the tahles at the Institution.  list

of their names and the time of stay will be found appended. During the-

same period, packages of specimens have been forwarded to fifty-one

Adifferent naturalists and institutions.   list of these is also appended.

Recently a new department has been added to the Station. Through

this naturalists will be enabled to obtain mounted specimens of microscopic

animals, viz., sections of embryos of all kinds of fishes, &c, preparations

of larvae or other animals too small for being sent in alcohol or other

preservative solutions. Next year a catalogue of these specimens will be

published, and the Station will be prepared to send the specimens to any

naturalist requiring them.

Trials of diving by means of the new Scaphander apparatus have alsa

recently been made with very satisfactory results.

The aquarium of the Station is being in part reconstructed, with some

important new features, viz., moveable rockwork, for saving and examin-

ing the different animals which thrive by themselves on these rocks. This

will enable statistical notes to be established on the growth of these ani-

mals, and on such changes as may occur by changing their habitat, inas-
much as these rocks may be replaced in the sea at different depths.

     The following monographs are in preparation by workers in the Sta-

--tion : Ctenophoraa, Fierafer, Balanoglossus, Sipunculoida?, Capitellidse,

Planariae, Nernertineae, Pycnogonidaa, Caprillidaa, and on sevex'al families of

Algae.

Three parts of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu

Neapel, zugleich ein Repertorinm fur Mittelmeerkunde ' have been pub-

lished, containing sixteen papers illustrated with many very carefully

executed plates. Further parts are in active preparation.

It is, moreover, intended to publish the following works :

' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel und der angrenzenden

Meeresgebiete.' Folio. Yearly, 1 volume with 10-20 plates. The first

volume is already in the press.            A selection from the whole
     ' Prodromus Fauna? Mediterraneae.'

Zoological Literature of short Latin Diagnoses of the Animals found in the

Mediterranean, with their habitats and local names.

' Zoologischer Jahresbericht.' This will contain short notices on the

various memoirs and papers published in various countries on the subjects

of Zoology, Development, and Comparative Anatomy. It is under the

editorship of Professor Carus, with the assistance of four collaborateurs in

different countries. One volume will appear yearly.

    Two naturalists have occupied the table hired by the Association, viz.,

Mr. Walter Percy Sladen and Mr. Patrick Geddes. Mr. Sladen has sent

in a report on his stay and his work, which is appended. In this report

he proposes a' means by which the table might be even more fre-

quently occupied than it has been, and its sphere of utility thus extended,

by suggesting to the consideration of the Committee that a further addi-

tional grant might be made by the Association, which would serve as a

travelling fund. This might be apportioned in moieties say of 251. to

naturalists who desired to avail themselves of such assistance, and it is not

improbable that many a student would by this means be enabled to par-
ticipate in the advantages of the table at Naples, who might otherwise be
j j. erred by the expense of the journey. The plan, extended or modified

ording to circumstances, is one adopted by several of the foreign bodies,

ha *n& tables at the Zoological Station.'
                ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                                  167

     Mr. Patrick Geddes worked at the Station from February 26 to April 4.

He ' repeated and extended certain observations on Echinoderm histology,

and made experiments on Bunellia viridis and Idotea viridis, with a view
of ascertaining the functions of their (supposed) chlorophyll.' The results

of these studies are at present beiug published in the ' Archives de Zoo-
logie Experimental ' of M. de Lacaze Duthiers, viz., ' Etudes sur le
Chlorophylle Animal ; ' ' Observations sur le Fluide Perivisceral des

Oursins.'

     Mr. Geddes also gained information on the working of the Station, in
the hope (now realised) of helping to found a Zoological Station in Scot-

land. This station is now in working order at Stonehaven.

    Mr. Arthur Wm. Waters, who worked at the Association table last

year, intends again to apply for the appointment to occupy it, with a view

of extending his researches on the Bryozoa of the Bay of Naples, already
published in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' 1879.

     Your Committee think that the above particulars are sufficiently en-
couraging to induce the Association to renew the grant of 751. for the

ensuing year.

Report on the Occupation of the Table, by Mr. W. Percy Sladen.

In conformity with the requirements of the Committee of the British

Association appointed in connection with the Zoological Station at Naples,

I beg to submit the following report concerning my occupancy of the

table which I had the privilege of using.

In availing myself of the opportunity of working at Naples, the main

object which I had in view was that of studying the pre-mature stages of

the Echinodermata, and more especially the growth-phases which inter-

--vene between the period when the pluteus is resorbed and that at which

the adult characters are developed the range and significance of these

changes being very important and remarkable throughout the group. In

addition to this chief object, it is scarcely necessary to add that there were

numerous points in the morphology of Echinoderms upon which, as a

myspecialist, I was anxious to direct                                                                 attention, should time and oppor-

tunity permit.

I arrived in Naples on December 3, 1878, and remained there until

February 17, 1879. During the greater portion of the time the weather

was very inclement and stormy ; in consequence of which the pelagic

larval forms that I had hoped to have met with, by use of the surface- net,

were driven to too great a depth, and owing to their microscopic propor-

tions became thus altogether inaccessible. For this reason I was greatly

disappointed in my expectations, and the material which I was able to
obtain, in any way available for my projected investigations, was unfortu-

nately very scanty                                                                                    nevertheless several pre-mature forms of considerable
                                                                                                   ;

interest were procured, and these I am hoping still further to elucidate,

before the end of the year, by finding if possible the corresponding and

intermediate stages on our own coasts, and which will then enable me to

work out the development of at least one or two forms completely. I also

endeavoured to contribute somewhat to this subject by means of the arti-

ficial fertilization of ova in several different families, but was always un-

successful in keeping the plutei alive beyond a certain stage ; whilst the

fact that those thus raised in confinement were subject to very consider-

mable abnormality their development and present unnatural modifications

which require much care and skill in elimination, in order to avoid error
168 eeport-- 1879.

in subsequent deductions, greatly diminishes the utility of such observa-

tions as a direct method of embryological study, although they are not

without value as furnishing some indication of the plasticity inherent in a

given form.

Better success rewarded what I may speak of as desultory investiga-

tions upon the general structure of Bchinoderms. I may mention that I

have in hand a contribution to the knowledge of Pedicellarice, which I

consider will throw light (if not entirely, at least in part) upon the

functions of these obscure appendages. It was also my good fortune to

discover in certain Asteroids an hitherto undescribed organ, most pro-

bably  performing     sensorial  functions                                             an  account  of   which  I  hope  to
                                                                                    ;

publish shortly, as soon as time permits me to work up the material which

I collected more exhaustively than I was able to do whilst staying at

Naples. In addition to the above I am also hopeful of furnishing a com-

munication upon the pre-mature anatomy of certain young Echinoderms,

for which purpose I was able to preserve and bring back with me several

very good series of specimens.

The general success and continually increasing prosperity of the

Zoological Station at Naples are now so fully known from the reports and

various publications emanating from the Institution itself, that it would

be presumption on my part to offer any remarks in such a direction. I

consider, however, that it is a duty for me to bear my individual testi-

mony to the admirable arrangements which characterise the working of

the Station, and which conduce so greatly to the comfort of naturalists

engaged in studying there. The daily supply of fresh material, the tank

and aquarium accommodation for keeping the same alive, are highly satis-

factory,  and  leave  little to  be  desired                                           whilst  in   the  way    of ordinary
                                                                            ;

laboratory appai'atus and re-agents no reasonable requirement is un-

provided for.

I also desire to record my indebtedness for the genial kindness and the

ever-ready assistance which I met with not only from Dr. Dohrn and the

acting director Dr. Eisig, but the same friendly spirit of courtesy and

help wras accorded me without exception by every gentleman connected

with the staff.

The utility of the Zoological Station being now so thoroughly estab-

lished, and its reputation world-wide, it is unnecessary for me to allude to

the fact, except to point out that the maintenance of such an undertaking

is very costly, and that of necessity the results can only be continued by

keeping up the funds. So much good work has already emanated from

the Station at Naples that the Institution has a fair claim not only upon

biological specialists, but on every one interested in the advancement of

science. Upon such an argument, therefore, the Zoological Station is

particularly worthy of the support of the British Association, even if its

members were not (as many of them have already been), individual par-

ticipants in the advantages which the Station provides and on this
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

ground I would strongly urge the continuance of the grant usually made

by the Association.

I would further beg to propose a means by which the table might be

even more frequently occupied than it has been, and its sphere of utility

be thus extended, by suggesting to the consideration of the Committee

that a further additional grant might be made by the Association, which

would serve as a travelling fund. This might be apportioned in moieties

say of 251. to naturalists who desired to avail themselves of such assist-

axice, and it is not improbable that many a student would by this means
be enabled to participate in the advantages of the table at Naples, who
might otherwise be deterred by the expense of the journey. The plan,

extended or modified according to circumstancss, is one adopted by
several of the foreign bodies having tables at the Zoological Station.

    In conclusion I desire to express my cordial thanks to the Committee

of the British Association for the privilege of using the table at their

disposal.

them, but in some cases the layer has resisted denudation and forms a

sort of platform. In other places, where the layer dips, it may appear at

the surface as an outcrop, or form a diminutive escarpment.

The space over which this layer spreads has not been accurately made

out. It is not, however, co-extensive with the sandhills, which can be

explained by supposing that other hills of sand have been heaped up

since the time the manufacturers of flint implements lived there. At

Portstewart and the opposite side of the river Bann this layer may be

estimated with safety to spread over two square miles, all of which,

with the pits already mentioned, has a covering of sand, not of a shifting

nature, but of a permanent kind, because covered and protected by a close

crop of vegetation. Although the sandhills now reach to the very mouth

of the Bann, the black layer does not extend so far. It has been observed
that from 1^ to 2 miles from the river's mouth, though we have the same
kind of sandhills and pits as we have farther inland, there are no such black

layers or flint objects to be found on either side of the river, which would

lead to the conclusion that at the time this black layer was an exposed
surface the river Bann emptied into the sea about two miles farther inland

than it does at present.

The operations of the past year at Portstewart have been chiefly

confined to digging over the exposed portions of the black layer, though
a small amount of excavation has been made into the black layer which

is still beneath the sandy covering.

In one spot of exposed layer, measuring three square yards, one scraper,

one core, and several flakes were obtained, but no animal remains. Another

small piece of layer, of similar extent in a different pit, yielded several

flakes and a great many fragments of pottery. Two small pieces were

ornamented. These were parts of the rim of a vessel, and the orna-

mentation was longitudinal lines with cross striation, resembling what

would be produced if the milled edge of a shilling were rolled along soft

clay. No animal remains were found. Another small piece of exposed

layer in a third pit yielded a little nest of eleven small scrapers, but no

other remains.

In one of the largest pits, at a place where the edge of the dark layer

is seen cropping out under 50 feet of sand, and where bones, both cut and
split, and also teeth had been found in abundance lying exposed, a portion

of the covering was removed, laying bare about 20 square yards of the

Adark layer, which was carefully dug over.  considerable quantity of

broken and split bones and teeth were obtained, chiefly those of ox and

deer, two flint flakes, two hammer-stones, one of which, in addition to

the hammered ends, had its sides also hammered, as if an attempt had

been made to form an oval tool-stone. The depression seems to have

been formed by repeated blows with another stone being struck on the
same spot. Also a small stone, four inches long, rather square in section,
having one end sloped away by rubbing. Mixed up with these in the

layer were small pieces of charred wood and many broken and rounded

stones, and also a few shells, chiefly Patella. It was near this place that
some bone implements, a small ornament, and cut bones were found on

the surface, and which have been described in previous papers. One of

the persons employed, in the absence of your secretary, dug out of the layer

at this place a portion of the antler of a red deer having several tines
sawn off. It is the upper half of the antler, and one long tine remains

projecting at the upper extremity in such a way that a sort of pick is

formed. In the centre of this pit, and only a few yards from the place
where the bones have been found so plentifully, a very large quantity of
flint scrapers, several arrowheads, knives, hammer-stones, and cores
were obtained, all mixed up with an immense quantity of flint flakes and

--chips.
     OastlerocJc. The Bann separates this place from Portstewart. Sand-
hills containing similar implements are found here. On a recent visit of

the Ballymena Naturalists' Field Club, accompanied by the Rev. Dr.

Grainger, M.R.I.A., Vice-President, and also a member of this Committee,
as many as 200 flint implements of various kinds were obtained, but the

--layer where experimented on yielded rather poor results.
      Whitepark Say, Ballintoy. There are sandhills at this place some-
what similar to those at Portstewart, and there is also the dark-coloured
implement-bearing layer, but the portion richest in remains lies along the
top of a bank quite close to the sea and about 30 feet above sea level. The
sand has been removed from above the layer on the top of this bank for
about a quarter of a mile in length by a few yards in breadth, leaving

the comparatively solid floor of blackish matter undisturbed in many
spots. About 30 square yards of the richest part of this floor was dug

over, and it yielded a great quantity of flakes, fifty-three scrapers, two

large triangular-shaped flints, one of which is dressed at the pointed
end after the manner of a scraper, a bored stone or whorl, the thick end

of an antler of a red deer, having a hole bored through near its base, the
half of an oval tool-stone, cores, several hammer-stones, one showing
work on the sides as well as at the ends, a bone pin, a bone needle, several
pieces of pottery, showing handsome ornamentation, an ochreous stone,

which has been much rubbed and scraped, and a small portion of a

similar stone. There were also a few shells and a great quantity of teeth
and bones mixed up with the implements. The long bones were all
broken and split. The bones and teeth corresponded very closely with
those previously found lying exposed on the surface, and which Professor

A. Leith Adams found to contain those of man, horse, ox, wolf or dog,

fox, deer, and hog.
     The hole in the antler is oval, and gets narrower towards the centre,

like the holes in many stone hammers. At the surface it is \\ inches in

diameter longitudinally and 1^ inches across. In the centre of the hole
the diameters are nearly 1 inch and | inch respectively.

      The hole in the whorl is comparatively wide at both surfaces of the

stone, about ^ inches in diameter, and gets narrower towards the centre.
The outer and wider portions have a battered appearance, as if those
 parts had been formed by hammering, but the central portion has a
 ringed appearance, some parts being wider than others. This central

part may have been bored by means of a rotating stick and sharp sand
 and water. The wider portions would be formed when the end of the

   --JDundrum, County Down. There are extensive sandhills at this place,

 which were lately examined by the secretary of this committee. Fre-
 quent visits have been made to this place by the Belfast Naturalists' Field

 Club and by Mr. Gray, who is president of the society for the present

 year, and it has been described as one of several places where flint flakes
 and scrapers are to be found. It was not, therefore, expected that any
 quantity of remains would be obtained, and the chief object in going
174 kepokt-- 1879.

was to ascertain if there were the same implement-bearing layers here

as at Portstewart and Ballintoy. Mr. Knowles visited Dnndrum on two

occasions alone in July, and once in August, accompanied by the Rev.

Dr. Grainger. On these three occasions 1122 manufactured objects were

obtained, viz. 1013 scrapers, forty-one arrow heads, forty-six scrapers
with concave scraping edge, eighteen dressed flakes and borers, one stone,
somewhat of the nature of an oval tool-stone, one of those oval stones
with a small track on each side, described in the Catalogue of the Royal

Irish Academy as sling- stones, one stone like a tool-stone, but having only
one side indented, and also a small serpentine bead of similar form, but
slightly larger than those found at Portstewart, which have been described
in previous papers. Here, as at Portstewart and Ballintoy, there are some-
times several black layers to be seen, and it has been remarked that
generally only one of those layers contains flints. Sometimes a large pit
has a pillar of sand standing up capped by a black layer, or perhaps there
may be a large table-like mass, capped in a similar way. The majority of
the objects described were found exposed, many showing evidence of
having only recently dropped from the layer, but in places where exca-
vation was tried as an experiment, scrapers were found, as at the places

previously mentioned. In one place the flint objects were found close to
the edge of a layer, where they had been set free by denudation ; while in
another layer, higher up on the side of the same pit, there was no trace
of implements, though full of rounded and broken stones, and at first
sight presenting a very similar appearance to the layer below.

     The scrapers are mostly all of very small size. Hundreds of them
are not larger than the finger-nail, and in almost every case, no matter
how small, there is found remaining a portion of the original crust of the
pebble from which the scraper has been formed. Some of them are very
neatly dressed, and are beautiful objects.

     About one-third of the arrowheads are perfect and of great beauty.
In one case a broken one has had the broken edge dressed and formed

into a scraper.

     The scrapers with concave scraping edge were no doubt used for
scraping cylindrical objects. They are nearly all perfect, and it was re-
marked about them, as about the arrowheads, that where one was found
several more might be expected. These hollow scrapers were found
chiefly in three spots, and about a dozen were obtained in each place. The
other objects are chiefly flakes, dressed over the back or along the edges,
and having a flat side undressed. The contrast between this place and
Ballintoy is very marked. Here everything points to a scarcity of
material, and comparatively few flakes are left undressed. Even other
rocks are found split up into flakes, and two beautiful flakes of a rock
crystal were picked up. At Ballintoy and some other places, on the
other hand, there seems to have been a perfect waste of material, and

every object is of large size.

     The stone which bears some resemblance to a tool-stone is rather
irregular in form, and the hollows are not equal in size nor exactly
opposite each other, but the hollows communicate by a very narrow

opening.

    The so-called sling-stone was picked up by Dr. Grainger. He was

walking slowly along near the edge of a large pit and found it lying

among a few other pebbles, but it cannot be said that any flint objects
were in association with it. At the distance of a few yards, however,
--'

REPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.  175

towards the centre of the same pit, ten or twelve scrapers with concave
edge, several other scrapers, and a beautiful stemmed arrowhead, were

found.

     The bead was also found by Dr. Grainger, and some scrapers were
found quite near to it. It is rounded on one side and flat on the other,
and similar in every respect, except size, to those found at Portstewart.

      Several hammer-stones were found having their sides as well as
ends hammered, sometimes hollows being formed, bearing a resemblance
to those on the sides of the oval tool-stones.

     Animal remains were very scarce, only a few teeth were picked up,
and these chiefly belonged to the horse, ox, and deer.

The Committee was appointed for the purpose of continuing the collection

of observations on the systematic examination of heights, weights, &c, of
human beings in the British Empire, and the publication of photographs
of the typical races of the Empire. That any conclusions drawn from

statistics thus collected may be trustworthy, it is obviously essential that

as large an average of facts as possible should be obtained, and that the
services of a large number of independent investigators should be enlisted.
Having, in previous years, laid down the lines upon which observers
should proceed, and prepared a circular of instructions, the attention of the

Committee has been directed this year not so much towards any attempt
to draw conclusions from the facts before them, as towards completing the

collection of data, and obtaining the services of fresh observers in various
quarters. They have endeavoured, wherever practicable, to induce per-

sons in a position to collect anthropometric statistics, particularly those
tending to establish a law of growth and development, to establish a
system of periodical record, which from year to year will increase in value

and interest. By this means, many difficult problems in relation to race,
occupation, climate, culture, &c, may in due course be solved.

     Considerable progress has been made by the Committee during the
year in the collection of observations and in reducing the results to a

tabular shape. No alteration has been made in the forms and instru-

ments used, except that the capacity of the spirometer-bag has been in-

creased, it being found that many persons in selected occupations exceeded
the maximum capable of registry by the original instrument. The types

for colour of hah- have been seriously reconsidered, and the ' stenochromic

--process approved but as the process turned out not to be commercially

available, no alteration in the existing book of types has been adopted.
     Returns have been received from the following sources, containing

the particulars undermentioned in respect of the number of individuals

stated in each case :

Mr. Roberts, which will be referred to at length in a subsequent part of

this Report. In those marked * particulars of race and origin have not

By the kindness of the authorities, a circular from the Committee was

distributed with the annual official return forms to every industrial and

reformatory school in the Kingdom, and returns have been obtained

from several such schools                                                                                                                 some of the results of  which are shown in the

foregoing tables.

The Committee have also addressed insurance companies with the view

of inducing their medical officers to keep accurate records of the physical

measurements of persons whose lives are proposed for insurance, and

in some instances have been informed that attention will be given to the

matter.

They have also addressed the following circular to the head-masters

of Public Schools :

     ' The Anthropometric Committee of the British Association have
directed me to forward you the enclosed papers, with the view of calling

your attention to the great service which the Public Schools might render

to Anthropometric Science by establishing a system of statistical record

of height, weight, strength, &c, for the purpose of ascertaining the laws

of growth and development in youth and adolescence.

' Some schools have already furnished the Committee with valuable

information of the kind desired. Marlborough School, for example, has,

for the last seven years, published in the Reports of the School Natural

History Society details of height, weight, chest and other measurements of

the boys ; and these statistics have been abstracted under the direction
of the Committee. The "Warden of Christ's Hospital, Major Brackenbury,

has for several years recorded the same details.

    ' The Committee hope that you may be induced to attempt a similar
record in your own school, and I am directed to say that they will gladly

render any assistance they can in setting it on foot. They are confident
that, when once established, you will find the materials collected so full of
interest and usefulness in many ways, that you will not regret any little
trouble it may give you at the outset, and they therefore do not refrain

from asking at your hands this service to Science, however unwilling

they may be to trespass upon time already fully occupied.

     ' The Medical Officer and the Drill Master of the School would, no

doubt, do whatever may be necessary towards preparing a complete and

accurate record.'

     Several replies to this circular have already been received from public

schools ; among them, the Head-master of Eton (the Rev. J. J. Hornby,
D.D.), who writes that he will be happy to do what he can to establish a

system of statistical record of height, weight, strength, &c, at Eton, for

the purpose of the Committee, at the termination of the present vacation.

    Mr. Roberts, a member of the Committee, whose ' Manual of Anthro-
pometry ' is of the utmost value to inquirers, has furnished the Committee
with a series of observations, illustrated by diagrams, and accompanied
by the following remarks on the establishment of a standard of stature and
weight. These are given as a specimen of the manner in which the infor-
mation the Committee is collecting may be made available.

     ' The accompanying tables and charts show that the average height
and weight varies with the social position and occupation of the people,
and to obtain the typical proportio us of the British race it would be neces-
sary to measure a proportionate number of individuals of each class, or a
community which comprised all the classes in the proportions in which

they exist in the whole nation. If we take the census of 1871 we shall

find that such a model community would consist of 14 - 82 per cent, of the

non-labouring class, 47"46 per cent, of the labouring class, and 37*72 per

cent, of the artisan and operative classes. Bat as many trades are con-

fined to certain districts it would be very difficult to find such a repre-
sentative population in a limited space in this country. The nearest

approach to one would be found in some of our larger county towns, such

as York, Derby, or Exeter, with a large portion of the surrounding agri-

cultural districts.

' As the statistics which I have collected in England represent various

classes rather than the general population, I have arranged them in a

-- --double series a most favoured class and a least favoured class and I

have adopted the average of the two extremes as typical of the English

nation. The American statistics, with which 1 have compared my own,

are very valuable, as they represent the general population of the United
States. Dr. Bowditch's data were collected " in nearly all the public

(common) schools of the city of Boston, in several schools in South Bos-

ton, Roxbury, Charlestown, and Jamaica Plain; in the Institute of Tech-

nology, in two Latin schools, a school for young ladies, and in several

public (common) schools in Brookline," (" On the Growth of Children,"

8th An. Rep. State Board of Health of Mass., 1877), and Dr. J. H. Bax-

--ter thus vouches for the representative character of the statistics published

by the United States Government : " It should be borne in mind that

this statistical matter does not relate to soldiers already in the service

--picked men in no wise representing the masses but to the people, the

men engaged in every occupation ; the professional man and the man of

letters, the trader, the merchant, the clerk, the artisan and the unskilled

labourer." (" Statist. Med. and Anthrop.," vol. i. p. 19.)
     ' The accompanying tables and charts show the relation which exists

between the height and weight (1) of the most favoured and the least

favoured classes of the English population                                                                                                                                                                                          (2) between the English and

tracings No. 1 ; tables I. and II., columns 1, 2, and 3.) From birth

to the age of 6 or 7 years the statistical data are imperfect, but it

is probable from the directions of the curves of growth that all classes

of the English population are about the same in height and weight at

this period. After the age of 8 years the curves diverge very rapidly,

the divergence being due to a slower development of the labouring and

artisan class.

' After 8 years the professional class exceeds the labouring and artisan

class, thus :

'The greatest difference in height is at 12 years, when it amounts to

about 4 inches                                                                   the greatest difference in weight is at 17-18 years, when
                                                                              ;

it amounts to nearly 20 lbs. The full stature is attained earlier in the

professional than the artisan class ; in the former about the age of 21

years, and in the latter between 25 and 30 years. The American statis-
tics show that a slight increase in height takes place up to the 35th year.
The growth in weight does not cease with that of the stature, but con-

tinues slowly to increase in both classes up to about the 30th year.

' 2. The relation between the height and weight of English-born and

American-born subjects.                                                          (Chart tracings No. 2                                                                                                 tables I. and II., columns

3, 4, and 5.)

   A' comparison of the average stature of the English and American

branches of the British race shows that they are nearly identical from

the age of 4 years to the period of full growth, but the weights differ at
the two ends of the curves.

' In stature, between the ages of 4 and 8 years, the American exceed

the English by rather less than half an inch ; but this is, no doubt, to be

attributed to the fact that the English statistics during this period are

derived entirely from our town population. From 9 to 15 years the sta-

ture of the two branches of our race is the same, and from 16 to 22 it is

slightly in favour of the English. At adult life the Americans are a little

taller than the English, but the number of the English observations after

the age of 22 is not sufficient to determine this point accurately.

' In weight, from the age of 5 to 10 years, the English exceed the

Americans, but this is probably to be attributed to the greater weight of

the clothes worn by the poorer classes in this country. At 12 the weight

is equal ; from 13 to 16 it is in favour of the Americans, from 17 to 19 of

the EngUsh, and after 20 years of the Americans. The number of obser-

vations for each age after 16 years of the Americans are too few to be

relied on.

     ' Mr. Gould and Dr. Baxter have shown that, of the recruits for the

American Army those born of American parents are taller than those born

of English parents, and it has been inferred that a change has taken place

in the physical proportions of our race in that country. Dr. Baxter found

the average stature of the American-born recruits, between the ages of
30 and 35 years, to be 6822, the English-born 66-92, and the Irish-born

66-91 inches. But the difference in height is to be explained by the dif-

ference in the class from which the recruits were drawn. The English

and Irish being emigrants from this country consisted almost entirely of

the labouring and artisan class, which we find in this country has an

average stature of 66'95                                                         inches                                while the American recruits were drawn
                                                                                                                    ;

from all classes of the community by conscription. The average height

of all classes in England between the ages of 25 and 30 years is 68 - 00
inches, and of the corresponding ages in America 68T2 inches, and the

slight advantage which the Americans possess is probably due to the
very large number of observations (38,055) from which the average is
drawn, compared with the very small number of the English (142).

     ' The averages of the stature and weight of the two great branches of

the British race being so nearly alike, I have deduced from tbem a typical

standard of height and weight for the whole British (Anglo-Saxon or

Anglo-American) race, which will be found in the 5th column of Tables

--I. and II. This standard does not consist of any one of the nationalities
   English (and Welsh), Scotch, and Irish-- of which our race is com-

represented, and there is a large admixture of the Scotch element in both.

In order to distinguish the relative stature and weight of the three na-

tionalities I have had recourse to the army returns of both countries, and

the results are given in detail in Tables III. and IV. (as shown on pre-

ceding page).

     ' These tables show that the English (and Welsh) recruits are shorter

in stature than the Irish by O30 of an inch, and the Scotch by 044 of an
inch ; and the American recruits bom in Great Britain are about half an

inch shorter in stature than those of corresponding nationality in the

English army.

     ' The Scotch recruits in Great Britain though possessing the greatest

stature, are lighter in weight than the English (and Welsh) by 3 - 3 lbs.,
and the Irish by 4 - l lbs., and the Irish are nearly 1 lb. heavier than the

English.

     'Lowering the standard of height from 66 inches in 1862-3 to 65

inches in 1864-5 lowered the average stature of the English by 017 inch,

of the     Scotch  by 021 inch,                                                                                    and of the       Irish  by 025 inch                                                   but there was
                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

an increase of weight in all three nationalities. In the Scotch it amounted

to 67 lbs.

     ' It is probable that the stature of the English recruits is lowered by a
large admixture of Welsh, and by the young musicians, who are almost

entirely of English birth and often under the standard height.

British or Anglo-Saxon race. (Chart tracings No. 3 ; tables I. and II.,

columns 5 and 6.)

     My' statistics of the height and weight of females in England are

very limited in extent (from 8 to 14 years of age), and refer only to the

labouring and artisan class. As the average male population of England
and America are so nearly identical, we may accept the measurements of

American girls published by Dr. Bowditch as applicable to this country

also. These were collected in the common schools in Boston and sur-

rounding neighbourhood, under the same circumstances and at the same

time as the males, and fairly represent the general population. They are
given in column 6 of tables I. .and II., and the tracings are shown in
diagrams 3 and 4. The observations at the time of birth are English,

collected by myself, but all the remainder are American.
     ' At birth girls are about ^ of an inch shorter tban boys, and from 1 to

4 there is a much wider difference, but the statistics are too few to deter-
mine the amount. From 5^ to 10^ the stature of the two sexes is nearly

the same, the advantage being slightly in favour of the boys ; but after
the age of 11^ and up to 14^ years the girls are the taller ; at 12^ the

difference is 0'84, and at 13^ 088 of an inch. From 15^ to 18^ the growth
of the boys is much greater than that of the girls. At 15 the difference
in favour of the boys is T06 inches; at 16, 3 - 02 inches; at 17, 4"10; and

at 18, 4 - 85 inches, at which age the females probably attain their full

stature. (Chart tracings No. 4; tables I. and II., columns 5, 6, 7, and 8.)
     ' In considering the weight of the two sexes, we find that at birth girls

are  ^ lb.  lighter  in weight than boys                                                                                            at 5 and 6 the difference amounts

to about 6 lbs., but after the latter age the weights gradually approximate,

and at 12 they are identical. From 12^ to 15^ the girls are heavier than

the boys, the difference at 13J being 452 lbs., and at 14^, 5'02 lbs. At

15-| the weight of the two sexes is again identical, and after this period

the excess is largely on the side of the boys ; at 16^ it is 7"73 lbs., at 17^,
13-85 lbs., and at 18£, 19-27 lbs.

     ' As M. Quetelet's tables are the only complete series of observations on
the height and weight of both sexes, and at all ages, we possess, and as

they have been generally accepted by anthropologists and physiologists

as reliable standards, especially at ages below the adult period of life, I

myhave added his figures to  tables, and traced their relation to the British

statistics on the diagrams 3 and 4, for the purpose of comparison. M.
Quetelet does not state the number of observations on which his tables

were based, but they were few (" peu considerable." " Anthrop." p. 182);

and probably did not exceed ten individuals for each age (" Anthrop." p.
24); moreover, the measurements were made on persons "regularly formed,"

and therefore to a certain extent selected. It is necessary to bear these

facts in mind in estimating the value of M. Quetelet's tables as standards

of reference, and when comparing them with the English and American

tables based on many hundreds of observations for each age. M. Quetelet

does not state whether the values for each age are for the birthday or for

the interval between two birthdays, and I have therefore arranged them

like the British, as representing the age between two birthdays. This is

important, as bearing on the absolute height and weight, but not on the

curves of growth. In the tracings on diagrams 3 and 4 the lines repre-

senting the Belgians would be one division of the scale nearer to the lines

representing the English if the figures represent the birthdays, but the

relative position of the various curves would remain the same. If M.

Quetelet's figures represent the heights and weights of the birthdays

exactly, there is a difference of half a year in favour of the British at all

ages after that of birth.

' The curves show that growth in height is greater in the British from

birth to 5 years than in the Belgians. From 6 to 12 years the curves

approximate, and the difference is two-thirds less than it was at 5 years of

age. From 13 to 17 years the growth of the British is much more rapid

than that of the Belgians, the difference in stature at the latter age

being about four times greater than it is at 12 years. At adult life the

difference in height of the males of the two countries is nearly 2 inches,

while the height of the females is the same in both. The most marked

differences of the height of the two peoples, is in the relation of the two

sexes, the British girls being taller than boys from 11 to 14 years, while

the Belgian females are shorter than the males throughout their lives.

' The curves of the weight of the body in the two countries are very

similar, except that the weight of the British girls from 12 to 15 is

greater than that of the boys of the same ages, whereas the weights of the

Belgians of both sexes are the same at 12, but at all other ages the

females are lighter than the males.

' The differences between British and Belgian statistics cannot be attri-

buted to differences in race, as they are not uniform throughout, and we

must consider M. Quetelet's tables, based as they are on so small a number

of observations, rather as approximations or estimates of the stature and

weight of his countrymen. The difference in the height and weight of the

sexes, which was first pointed out by Dr. Bowditch (" Boston Med. and

Surg. Journal," 1872), has quite escaped the notice of M. Quetelet,

although he has published some British statistics, which demonstrate its

existence, and it has been confirmed by all the statistics which have been
208 report-- 1879.

collected since. The difference is due to the more rapid growth, and the
attainment of maturity at an earlier age, of females than males, for we
find that the curve representing females between the ages of 11^ to 18^
is almost identical with the curve representing males between the ages of
14^ and 21^ years, these two periods corresponding with each other in
the physical development of the two sexes. It is probable that the curve
representing males from 11 to 14 years is depressed a little by school life
and the earlier occupation of boys than girls, but the chief difference is

obviously attributable to the quicker development of girls, as it is found
to exist in all classes of the community. The large number of observations

included in my tables show that the difference is constant, and it must there-

fore be accepted as a fact essential to the proper study of the growth of

civilised races, no matter from what cause it may arise.'

The attention of the Committee has been directed to the progress of

anthropometric research in other countries. The ' Annals of Statistics '

for 1878, published by the Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and Com-

merce of Italy, has two anthropometric papers of considerable interest

directly bearing on the subject of this Committee's inquiry. The first is

by Dr. L. Pagliani on the development of the human body. Referring

to his own work 'Sopra alcuni fattori dello sviluppo umano,' to Dr.

Bowditch's investigations as to the growth of children, and to ' Die

Entwickelung des Menschen in den der Geschlechtsreife vorangehenden

spateren Kindesjahren und im Jiinglingsalter (von 7 bis 20 Jahren) in

Verhaltniss zum Geschlecht, zur Ethnographie und zu den Nahrungs- und

Lebens-Bedingungen in Moleschott's Untersuchungen zur Naturlehre des

Menschen und der Thiere,' Dr. Pagliani confirms the observation of Dr.

Bowditch that up to 10 years of age the stature and weight of children

of both sexes present but little difference, though they are always in

favour of  boys                         that  from  10  to  15  years of  age the difference becomes
                                     ;

greater, and is always in favour of girls ; and that after 15 the boys

reassert their superiority, and are found to be taller and heavier. Dr.

Pagliani also confirms Mr. Roberts's observation that the economic

condition of the child has much influence on his, or her, weight and

stature. In weight and stature alike the children of the labouring

classes stand lower than the children of the well-to-do classes. This

is the result of a considerable number of observations in Tui-in, and

is fully borne out by the diagram which accompanies the memoir.

Signor Cesare Lombroso in his paper ' On the Anthropometry of the

Lucchesia and Garfagnana ' endeavours to prove from the high stature,

black hair, formation of the head, tending to the dolichocephalic, or

head of the African type, i.e. one with its diameter from side to side

notably shorter than the diameter from front to back, the opposite

to brachycephalic, and from other distinctive characteristics, that the

people of those States come from the old Etruscan race. Both memoirs

illustrate in a conspicuous manner the utility and importance of the in-

quiry which our Committee has undertaken to institute. M. Quetelet's

work upon 'Man (Sur l'homme et le developpement de ses facultes),' is well

known. But at this moment extensive inquiries in the same direction are

being made in Germany, the United States, and other countries. Recent

political events, moreover, have imparted a fresh interest on questions of

races, and if we are able to extend our researches over all the portions of

the British Empire, the home of so many races, we may contribute largely

 to the amount of general knowledge on the physical and intellectual

 powers of man. 1

       Professor Bowditch, of Harvard, Mass., has published a supplementary

 investigation of the growth of children, with suggestions in regard to
 methods of research, in the 10th Annual Report of the State Board of
 Health (Boston, 1879). His object was to ascertain whether differences of
 race or differences in the mode of life affect the rate of growth the more
profoundly. The general conclusion he arrives at is that mode of life, as
 indicated by the occnpation of the parents, is equally important with race
in determining the rate of growth of children. In his remarks on An-
 thropometrical methods, Dr. Bowditch reprints, with approval, the forms
and instructions which have been issued by this Committee, and recom-

mends the manual and chart prepared by Mr. Roberts. He also advises

the use of the card system, extensively adopted in Germany, in which the

facts relating to every single person are collected upon a card, which can
be combined with other cards in any number of ways, according to the
nature of the facts desired to be grouped together. This plan the Com-
mittee have resolved to adopt wherever it can conveniently be applied,
and a form of card has been drawn up for use by the head-masters of"

public schools.

    A special inquiry has recently been instituted in almost every primary

school throughout Switzerland, at the instance of a Committee of the
Societe des Sciences Naturelles, for the purpose of ascertaining the dis-
tribution of the different colours of the iris, hair, and skin, as connected
with the settlement of the aboriginal races in that country.

     The coincidence of these several inquiries with that undertaken by
this Committee is exceedingly interesting, and leads to the hope that,

from all these various sources, information of great value may in due

course be elicited.

The Committee have made progress during the year in the collection
of typical photographs of the inhabitants of the British Islands, and have
Acompiled an album which is exhibited to this section.
                                                        sub- Committee
has been appointed for Bradford, but has not yet furnished a report.
mMr. Soi-by, LL.D,, F.R.S., has kindly undertaken to assist the Committee
    Sheffield with the results of his experience and observation. The
Committee hope to continue this branch of their operations during the
coming year.

  _ In addition to the collections referred to in the last Report, the Com-
mittee have been favoured with several other gifts and loans, and in par-

ticular with the loan of a fine collection, comprising 102 Maori and 4
Fijian photographs belonging to Mr. Alfred Eccles, of Torquay, with per-

mission to select from them such as may be suitable for reproduction in a

collection of photographic types of the races of the Empire.

     The Committee owe thanks to the numerous emplovers of labour

head-masters of public schools, medical officers of volunteer regiments'

public officers, and other persons who have furnished them with statistics!

 s well as to those who are now engaged in the collection of observations

tor their use next vear.

 210 report-- 1879.

 Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. Sclater, Dr. G. Haet-
      ladb, Sir Joseph Hooker, Capt. F. M. Hunter, and Professor
       Flower, appointed to take steps for the Investigation of the
       Natural History of Socotra.

 The Committee have not held any formal meetings, but have been in fre-

 quent communication with each other on the subject.

      The best time for the exploration of Socotra being from November to
 March, the Committee were not able to make the necessary arrangements
 last autumn. Next winter, however, they believe that Colonel H. H.

 Godwin-Austen, than whom no more competent naturalist could be found,

 will be able to undertake an expedition to Socotra, and to make a thorough
 investigation of its natural history. Colonel Godwin-Austen has applied
 to the Surveyor- General of India for the use of some of the assistants on
 his staff, and proposes to make a complete topographical survey of the

 island during the expedition.
      It is estimated that the total cost of the expedition will be about £300.

 Of this £100, granted by the Association last year, has been received by
the Committee and deposited in the London and County Bank at interest.
 The sum of £175, having been devoted to this same purpose out of the
 Government Fund of £4,000 administered by the Royal Society, has been
 paid to Colonel Godwin-Austen, and has been added to the account at the
 London and County Bank.

     There remains, therefore, only £25 requisite to complete the sum of

 £300, which the Committee consider will be required for the expedition.
      The Committee request that the Committee for the investigation of

the Natural History of Socotra may be reappointed, with the additional
name of Colonel H. H. Godwin-Austen, and that the balance of £25
necessary to complete the estimate of expenditure may be placed at their

 disposal.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. F. J. Bramwell,
    Mr. A. E. Fletcher, Rev. E. L. Berthon, Mr. James R. Napier,

   Mr. C. W. Meruifield, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. H. M. Brunel,
   Mr. J. N. Shoolbred (Secretary), Professor James Thomson, and

    Professor Sir William Thomson, on Instruments for Measuring
    the Speed of Shij^s.

It is with feelings of gTeat regret that the Committee have to advert to

the death of their chairman, the late Mr. Wm. Froude, M.A., F.R.S.

His somewhat sudden demise was a great loss to science, and especially

-- --to that branch of investigation the action of waves upon ships to

which he had devoted himself. His loss must be greatly regretted by
the British Association generally, but more particularly by this Com-
mittee, since by his death was left incomplete that series of experiments
upon those instruments for measuring the speed of ships, which had been
referred to this Committee to report upon, and which, at the instance of
         ON INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING THE SPEED OF SHIPS.             211

the Committee, he most kindly undertook to carry out at the experi-

menting tank at his house at Torquay.
     The result of the first portion of those experiments be presented,

through this Committee, to the Association at its meeting at Belfast in
1874. The second and concluding part he did not live to complete.

    His son, Mr. R. Edmund Fronde, who assisted his father throughout

the entire of his first set of experiments, has, however, communicated to

the Committee the result of some experiments carried out by Mr. Wm.

Froude last year with H.M.S. Iris, upon a pressure log, the form of
which was in accordance with the conclusions drawn from the first set of

experiments, detailed in the Report of 1874.
     The results are, it is understood, confirmatory of the views held by

the late Mr. Froude.

     The Committee deem themselves fortunate to be able to terminate
their labours by the presentation of this document as an appendix to this
report. They have only to add that having ascertained that the first
series of experiments for the Report of 1874 had entailed upon the late

Mr. Wm. Froude expenses amounting to 171. Is. 8d., they have refunded

that amount to his executors (out of the 501. originally granted to the

Committee).

                             Appendix.

To the Secretary of the British Association Committee on Instruments for
                                    Measuring the Speed of Ships.

                             Chelston Cross, Torquay, 27th July, 1879.

   --Dear Sir, In compliance with your request I proceed to give a

description of the character and behaviour of the pressure log used in the
M.M. trials of H.M.S. Iris last summer, in so far as it throws light upon
the points suggested for further inquiry in ray father's Report to the

Committee at the Belfast meeting of the Association in 1874.

    AIn the Iris two pressure tubes were used which I will call and B.

ABoth were 1^ inches external diameter. Tube finished at the outer

end  in  a  gunmetal  disc 8 inches diameter, and    2  inch  thick,  turned  in

                                                   T,,

a lathe on both faces nicely flat and square to the axis of the tube. The

disc extended completely across the tube end, so as to close it. Tube B

was simply plugged up, the plug being turned off square and true to the

axis, forming a plain flat end to the cylindrical tube. In each tube was

Afitted a central tube of smaller diameter.        nice clean hole about

^th inch diameter was drilled in the centre of the closed end of each

tube, communicating with the central tube, and a similar hole in the side

of each tube communicating with the annular chamber round the central

Atube. In tube        the side hole was distant 2 inches from the outer

surface of the disc, in tube B it was distant 3 inches from the outer

Asurface of the closed end.  cross section of each tube is given above.

Each of the two chambers in each of the two tubes communicated with

a gauge glass, the level of the water surface in which indicated the

pressure in the chamber. There were thus four gauge glasses in all,

two communicating with the side holes of the two tubes, two with the

end holes.

        Both tubes were fixed in the upright side of the ship (of course nicely
  square to the plating) between 2 and 3 feet below the water level, and a
  little way abaft the midships. [The Iris, it should perhaps be stated, is
  300 feet long, 46 feet beam, 18 feet mean draught (on trial). She has

    The object of the application of a pressure log to the ship was to aid

in  the  determination  of  the  speed  during  the steam trials                                                                                      the special
                                                                                                                                                   ;

object of the use of two tubes and other principal peculiarities of the

arrangement just described was to investigate, if opportunity should

serve : (1) the effect of distance of pressure hole from the ship's side (in

virtue of difference of position in regard to   the frictional wake)                                                                                         (2) the
                                                                                                                                                          ;

extent to which, if at all, the indication given by a pressure hole not far

from the end of a plain tube such as tube B, falls short of that given by

Aone in the side of a tube fitted with an end plate or disc, such as tube ;

(3) the relative goodness of the measures of general pressure of water

(to wive the zero of the scale of pressure due to speed) respectively

Aafforded by the hole in the end of the disc-tube when projected far from

the ship's side, and that in the end of the plain tube B when drawn in

flush with the ship's side. (That some such arrangement as either of

these might fulfil the desideratum of a ' working zero ' was suggested in

Mr. Froude's Report.) The general method in which the two tubes were

to be utilised for the above objects, was to retain one of the two unaltered,

as a check on variations of speed or trim of ship, while the desired

variations of condition were successively introduced into the other, and

the effect noted.

     Experiments of this kind could not however be carried on during the
runs on the mile, and as a fact circumstances did not admit of the
investigation of the points above described except in a- very hasty and
cursory manner during a preliminary run. During the runs on the mile
the disc tube alone was used, retained unaltered, at a projection of 15
inches (to the outer surface of the disc), the side hole being of course used
for the pressure, the end hole for the zero. The trials of the ship in
which the log was used were made on two different days, there being on
each day 8 runs on the mile, namely, 4 at 16 knots, 2 at 12 knots, and 2
at 8 knots. 1 During each run over the mile, the zero of the scale by
which the height of column was read off, was held level with the surface

of water in the glass communicating with the ' zero ' hole, the height of

column in the pressure tube being noted by the scale every 12 seconds;
     The speed of the ship through the wa.ter in any series of measured

mile runs in tidal water has of course- to be inferred from the recorded

times occupied in running the mile, by the aid (explicit or implicit) of

some assumptions in respect to the character of the variations of tide that
may have been occurring throughout the series of runs. The method of

eliminating tidal errors adopted by Mr. Froude in analysing the results of

the measured mile runs of   the  Iris would take  too long to explain here
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

suffice it to say that it is clearly as accurate a method as can be found,

since it utilises to the full all the obtainable facts.

    The information yielded by the experiments generally may be stated

as follows.

     1 . Comparison of speed theoretically appropriate to height of column
indicated by log, with speed of ship through water estimated from time
running the mile, in the manner above referred to, assigns about "925

to 1, as the average ' rate ' of the log (or ratio of speed of ship to

apparent speed bv log). The results are not inconsistent with the
supposition that the ' rate ' was uniformly -925 at all speeds ; but are

     1 Four runs were also taken on each day at full speed (about I8i knots), but the
log could not be used in these.
214 BEPOET-- 1879.

more consistent with the supposition of a variation of rate at different

speeds from about - 91 to "93. The impossibility of making a more definite

statement than this is an example of the impossibility of ' rating ' a log

very correctly for different speeds, by runs on the measured mile in a

tideway, except by means of a great number of runs.

   2. The instrument did not appear very sensitive to the effect of varia-

tions in distance of pressure aperture from the ship's side, at any rate

wben such distance exceeded one foot.

   B3. The pressure hole in the side of the plain tube gave little if at

all less height of column than that in the disc tube A. (This agrees

with proposition (3), page 257, in the 1874 Report.)

   A4. The ' zero ' holes in the ends of tubes and B both gave the same
height of column when tube B was, not flash with the ship's side, but

projecting                       about 2  inches                                 the column                                                                                                       given by tube                   B when flush with
                                                                              ;

the side being the greater of the two by perhaps 2 per cent, of the whole

head due to the speed of the ship at the time. There was no means of

testing which of these two ' zero ' holes (or whether either) gave the

correct zero of pressure. As speed increased both sank somewhat, rela-

tively to a fixed point in the ship, but whether more or less than the

water outside the ship was not ascertained. I am myself doubtful whether

the excess of pressure given by the zero hole in tube B, when flush with

the ship's side, relatively to that given by the zero hole of the disc-tube

A, is a genuine excess of pressure on the former due to some action of

the frictional eddies, or a genuine defect of pressure on the latter due to

the tube being possibly not dead square to the side (the disc consequently

moving somewhat obliquely through the water). An error of squareness

of the tube to the ship's side of 1° (pointing sternward) would, perhaps,

have been competent to produce the observed effect.

   Now, as to the information afforded by these results on the points

suggested by the 1874 Report, as needing solution.

   The treatment of the subject in that Report suggests a division of the

question into two, namely (1), the operation of the pressure log regarded

simply as a measure of its own speed in reference to the water it passes

through (the foremost difficulty here involved being that of establishing

a  'working zero ' for the instrument)                                                                                                                                                            (2), in what way its operation as
                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

an independent measure of the ship's speed through the water is affected

by the motions impressed by the passage of the ship on the fluid she dis-

places                           in other words, by                              the  difference                                                                                                  between  the                    speed of  the       in-
                              ;

strument through the water it meets with and the speed of the ship in

reference to the surrounding ocean.

   The Report described a series of experiments which dealt only with

question No. (1), and stated that the investigation of question No. (2)
might perhaps be introduced as a part of the methodical series of expe-

riments on resistance of ships which Mr. Froude was conducting at

Torquay. The investigation would certainly be of great value in refer-

ence  to the                     general question of resistance of                                                                                                                                ships                           but  the  pressure  of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

other work has, I regret to say, prevented its being undertaken.

   Of the results obtained in the Iris, and which I have above enume-

rated, Nos. (3) and (4) are pertinent only to question No. (1), namely,

the performance of the instrument regarded as a measure of its own
speed through the water it meets with. I think they show that a hole
iu the side of a tube, as much as two diameters distant from its end, will

burnish as good a measure of pressure due to the speed of flow past it
ON INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING THE SPEED OF SHIPS.  215

-as can be wished ; and that a small hole in the closed end of another
tube, flush with the ship's side, will furnish at any rate a very tolerable

working zero.
     The results I have numbered (1) and (2) are, so far as they go, per-

tinent to question No. (2), namely, the effect on the indications of the
log, produced by the motions caused by the ship in the surrounding
water. The information they afford is, however, very slight, as I will

proceed to show.

     The motions caused by the ship in the surrounding' water are two-
fold, namely, the frictional wake, and the stream line (or quasi- stream

line) motions. On the frictional wake part of the ques ion, the experi-

ments which were intended to be made in the Iris (as stated in paragraph 4,
above), on the effect on the pressure column of distance of the pressure
hole from the ship's side, would have given most important information,
had the trials of the ship permitted of their being properly carried out. The
hasty observations actually made, though sufficient to show that the pres-

sure hole, at a distance of a foot from the side, is clear of the extreme

ardency of the frictional wake, do not inform us how far it is necessary

that the pressure hole should be from the ship's side (at any given dis-

tance from the bow of the ship), in order for it to be altogether clear of
the wake. Yet if it is not altogether clear of it, the instrument cannot

be a permanently satisfactory measure of the speed of a ship which has
to remain long afloat, because any fouling of the ship and conseqnent in-
crease in skin friction, must increase the speed of frictional wake at given
speeds and given distance from the ship's side, and consequently diminish

the pressure indicated by the log at given speed.

     With reference to the more complicated question of the effect of the
stream line or quasi-stream line motions upon the ' rate ' of a pressure
Jog, the measurement of the ' rate ' (as by these experiments) in the
special case of the Iris, with the log in the single position in which it was
tried, is of small general value. The experiments which Mr. Froude
contemplated making in reference to this point, referred to in the 1874

Report, were to be of the nature of the application of a pressure log

to a great variety of models of ships in a great variety of positions. I
do not think that Mr. Froude expected that the information so ob-
tained would do more than enable us to so place the log in any given
ship, that its 'rate' should be approximately predeterminable and so far
uniform for all speeds, that it could be ' rated ' with sufficient accuracy
for ordinary sea-going purposes by a few runs at one speed on the mea-

sured mile.
      In the absence of these special experiments, our present knowledge of

the phenomena attendant on the passage of a ship through water may be

brought to bear advantageously on the question of the right place in the

ship for a pressure log ; and as I have had the advantage of frequently
discussing the subject with Mr. Froude, and had other opportunities for

its special study, in connection with our experiments on Resistance, I may

 be permitted perhaps to add a few words in reference to it.

     At low speeds in smooth water, when the surface of the water sur-
rounding a ship is visibly quite undisturbed by waves cansed by her

 movement, it cannot be doubted that the motions taking place at various

 points in the surrounding water are simply those which would take place

 in the same positions relatively to a symmetrical submerged body the

 lower half of which was similar to the immersed hull of the ship.
216 REPORT-- 1879.

It is an accepted proposition of the stream line theory that the stream

lines surronnding a submerged body are similar in character at all speeds,

the speed of stream at any one point in tbe system bearing at all speeds

Wethe same proportion to the speed of the submerged body.  may as-

sume then that as with a submerged body so also with a ship moving at

the surface of water, the speed of stream at any given point with refer-

ence to the ship (except in the purely frictional wake perhaps) will be

proportional to the ship's speed, at all speeds up to that at which sensible

waves commence to be formed. This would, moreover, continue to be

the case at higher speeds could the water surface be forcibly kept level

by a water deck (for instance) surrounding the ship in all directions, at

the level of her water-line.

Put then a pressure log where you will, its ' rate ' will under the sup-

posed conditions be constant for all speeds.

In the actual case of a ship without the imaginary water deck, the

' rate' will be in the same manner constant at all low speeds, and will at

higher speeds vary with varying speed only in virtue of the introduction

of the new set of fluid motions appropriate to the wave system which

begins to accompany the ship at higher speeds, and which essentially varies

in its character with varying speed.

The predominant characteristics of the wave system which thus comes

--into play at the higher speeds may be roughly noted, so far as pertinent

to the pressure log question, as- follows :

     (1) The wave system may be divided into two distinct series, the

transverse and the diverging, in the former of which the line of crest is

nearly square to the line of motion, in the latter trailing backwards at an

angle of forty or fifty degrees.

     (2) The waves (of the diverging series particularly) are comparatively
short along the line of crest, and die away gently into the level water a&

the ends.

     (3) Each series of waves is a continuous series, which, though it has
an abrupt commencement at the bow of the ship, 1, has no definite termi-

nation, but extends away backwards wave behind wave, the waves only

very gradually diminishing in height as they lengthen along the crest.

(4) In the transverse series the waves are placed directly one behind

the other, or nearly so, so that in a ship with very long parallel sides the

crests of the waves may be seen in cross section against the side repeated

one after the other. In the diverging series, on the contrary, a line drawn

from the highest point of each wave crest to the highest point of the next,

and from that to the next, and so on, intersects the lines of the crests at

an angle much sharper than the angle contained between the lines of the

crests and the line of motion of the vessel. The consequence of this

arrangement is that none of the diverging series of waves touch the side

of the ship at all, with the exception of the first member of the series^

which has its highest point near the stem of the ship (and in some cases

the second member also in a very small degree).

     (5) The system of proper local motions of the water composing the
waves probably resembles that recognised as appropriate to ocean waves,

    1 I am speaking here only of waves originating at the entrance of the ship, and

which are the only ones very important in reference to the pressure log question ; but
it is worth noting that a very similar set of waves, of both transverse and diverging
character, originate at the run of the ship also, the two sets of transverse waves (i.e.
the bow set and the stern set) becoming fused into one joint series.
ON INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING THE SrEED OF SHIPS.  217

namely, a forward motion under the crest and a backward motion under
the trough, tbough these local motions clearly cannot be supposed in the
leading members of the system to penetrate the water so deeply as in
properly formed ocean waves.

     (G) The transverse waves are necessarily much longer (measured

normally to the line of crest) than the diverging waves, and their proper-

motions therefore probably penetrate much the more deeply of the two.
(In ocean waves the wave motion at a depth equal to about one-ninth the

wave depth is held to be about half that at the surface.)
     (7) The diverging wave system is well marked at moderate speeds, at

which the transverse system scarcely appears. When, however, the speed

of the ship becomes high in comparison with her length of entrance, the
transverse system comes rapidly into promiuence.

     (8) The lengths of the waves (that is, their distance apart measured
normally to the ci'est line) vary as the square of the speed, and as the
leading wave crest remains always at the bow of the ship, change of speed
changes considerably the fore and aft positions of the subsequent members

of the transverse series relatively to fixed points in the side of the ship,
this rate of change of position increasing with distance sternwards.

     The general effect of the wave system upon the 'rate ' of a pressure

log fixed, near the water surface, amidships in a ship with long parallel

side will, then, be somewhat as follows. At moderate speeds at which
the transverse wave series does not come into play, the effect of the wave
system on the log will be nil, and the : rate ' will be the constant ' rate '
due to the stream line motion at its position. As the speed increases and
the transverse waves appear, and lengthen out with increasing speed, the
log indication will be alternately increased and diminished relatively to

the true speed, according as the speed reached brings trough or crest
over it. This kind of result would clearly be almost the most inconvenient
imaginable, 1 and though I have supposed an extreme case, the evil would
in most cases partake of the character I have sketched.

     The most objectionable feature in this supposed result is clearly due
to the change of position of the wave features relatively to the logs which
accompanies change of speed, and the magnitude of this evil is clearly
lessened generally speaking by putting the log as far forward as possible,
and therefore closer to the bow wave, the stationary or datum point of the
system, but by so doing it will be rendered more subject to irregularities

in its action due to pitching of the vessel. T am inclined to think that

underneath the position of the first wave-trough at a little under the full
speed of the ship would generally give about the best result, and I con-
sider this position (independently of the pitching question) preferable to

the back slope of the bow wave, for although the absolute effect of the
wave on the indication of the log would be more in the former position

than in the latter (in fact on the midslope it would be nil), the change of
wave position due to change of speed would produce a more changing
effect (and cause a more rapidly changing ' rate ') in the latter position
than the former.

     It is of course advisable to put the log as deep as possible, and indeed

      1 It did not indeed appear noticeably in the Iris, although the log was, as has
been stated, amidships and quite close to the water surface; but she is a ship with
nothing resembling parallel sides, and makes no transverse waves of importance
until she comes to making a single wave from end to end, with the trough amid-

ships.
218 report--1879.

a log near the keel of the ship would be altogether out of the depth of the
effect of the divergiug waves, though not of the transverse waves, except
perhaps in deep slow ships.

     To rehearse briefly the statements and line of argument of this com-

munication.

     (1) The behaviour of the pressure log in H.M.S. Iris showed that a
pressure hole in the side of a 1^ inch tube, and 3 inches from the end,
gave substantially the same pressure reading as one in the side of a similar
tube fitted with a disc at the end, such as that above described as

tube A..

     (2) The Iris pressure log results further show that either a small
hole in the end of a tube with a disc such as tube A, when projecting
from a ship's side ; or again a small hole in the end of a plain tube, such
as tube B, set with the end flush with the ship's side, will furnish a very
serviceable ' working zero ' for the pressure column.

      (3) Though the Iris results show that at a distance of 150 feet or so
from the bow of a ship a pressure hole more than one foot distant from

the ship's side may be accounted as clear from the extreme ardency of
the frictional wake, it remains to be tested how far distant from the side

a pressure hole need be (at any given distance from the bow) in order to

be so far clear from the frictional wake that the instrument may be ac-

counted as unaffected in ' rate ' by the degree of cleanness of the skin of
the ship.

      (4) There is an absence of direct experimental data generally appli-
cable to all cases, as to the effect on the ' rate ' of a pressure log, of the
' stream line' (or quasi-stream line) motions of the water surrounding
the ship. Variability of such ' rate ' with vai'yiug speed is clearly a

much greater evil than absolute greatness of such ' rate,' as involving

 great additional difficulty in correctly ascertaining its value for a given

ship at all speeds by means of M.M. ' Trials.' Our general knowledge of the

fluid conditions essential to a ship's progress through the water are so far
of assistance to us, in the absence of proper experimental data, in that
 it shows pretty clearly (a) that ' stream line ' motions proper, i.e. those due
 to motion of a submerged body (or a ship at the surface at low speeds)
 would cause a ' rate ' of log constant for all speeds ; and that varying
 speed will produce varying ' rate ' only in virtue of the formation of sur-
 face waves (b) that to avoid the variability of ' rate ' with varying speed,

                                                              ;

 introduced by the wave system, the best plan appears to be to fix the log
 as deep below the surface as possible ; and, in fore and after position,
 vertically under the position of the first wave-trough at rather less than

--the full speed of the ship. I remain, dear sir, yours faithfully,

                                                                         R. Edmund Froude.

           ON THE DATUM-LEVEL, ETC., OF GREAT BRITAIN.           219

Th ird Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William
   Thomson, Major-General Strachey, Captain Douglas Galton,
   Mr. G. F. Deacon, Mr. Kogers Field, Mr. E. Roberts, and
   Mr. J. N. Shoolbred (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
   considering the Datum-level of the Ordna,nce Survey of Great
   Britain, with a view to its establishment on a surer foundation
   than hitherto, and for the tabulation and comparison of other
   Datum-marks.

                                                   [Plate XIII.]

Appointed in 1875 at the Bristol meeting, to inquire into some uncer-
tainties as to the exact position of the Datum-level of the Ordnance

Survey of Great Britain, the Committee presented in 1877, at the

Plymouth meeting of the Association, a Report upon the subject.

At the conclusion of that report, the Committee requested to be re-

appointed ' in order to obtain information as to some of the various local

datum-marks in use in the British Isles, and to endeavour to ascertain
the difference of each relatively to the Ordnance datum ; which would

thus become a means of comparison between them.'

     The Committee beg to present, as an appendix to this Report, a list
of about fifty local datum -marks in Great Britain ; the connection of each
of which has been obtained on reliable authority. In Ireland the position
of some datum-marks there relatively to the datum of the Ordnance

survey of that country has also been ascertained.

    On the assumption that the mean sea-level, as given in the book of

Ordnance levels of the respective countries, is uniform across the Irish
Sea, the difference between the systems of levels in use in the two coun-

tries has been computed. In a similar way also has the difference been
ascertained between the Ordnance datum of Great Britain and the official

datum in nse in France (Zero du Nivellement general de la France

ligne de Bourdaloue) ; and, through it, with the official levelling in
Belgium and in Holland. Several local datum-marks in these countries
hp.ve been obtained, each with the connection with the Government

levelling of its own country.
    The Committee trust that this list may serve as a basis, which maybe

further extended, and become a means of obtaining accurate comparative

levels, not merely for engineering and other levelling operations, but also

for the connection of tidal observations round our coasts. On the

assumption already mentioned, of an uniform sea-level, tidal observations

on the adjoining coasts of Ireland and of the Continent may also be

included.

The question of a suitable datum-level as a basis for these international

Atidal observations, has been considered by the Committee.  level which,

while sufficiently low, so as to exclude negative readings, shall bear an

easily found relation to the respective datum-marks of the different

countries, is requisite for the purpose.
     It is found that, with the differences given in the list appended, a

level of · 20 ft. below the Ordnance datum of Great Britain ' coincides
(to within O'OT metre, or § in.) with ' 5-50 metres below the French
Zero du Nivellement;' and also to '12 ft. 6 in. below the Ordnance
datum of Ireland ' (to within 0-04 ft., or \ in.). This level has, more-
over, the advantage of being below the range of almost all the tides

round our coasts, excepting the low water of a few equinoctial springs at
two or three points, such as in the River Severn near to the mouth of the

Avon, and in the Bay of St. Malo on the coast of France.
     In conclusion, the Committee beg to add, that the 10?. granted to it

has been expended ; in expenses, in connection with levelling to ascertain
the exact relative position of the Ordnance datum of Great Britain, and
in correspondence and in other matters in the preparation of the list of
local datum-marks appended hereto.

The Committee have to report that they have held several meetings, at
which they prepared a memorial upon the Bill for the Amendment of the

Patent Laws, brought in by the Home Secretary and the Attorney-

General.

     This memorial is printed as an appendix to the Report of the Council,

p. lxiii.

     The memorial was presented to the Attorney-General by a deputation
from the Council of the Association on the 17th of May last.

     The bill became a lapsed order ; but the Committee have every reason
to hope that their recommendations will be duly considered if a similar
measure should be introduced in the next or any future session.

In the discussion on Mr. Barlow's paper on the upward jets of Niagara,
read at the Plymouth meeting of the Association, I made a few remarks
with reference to an improved form of self-acting siphon I had invented,
the action of which depends on the power of falling water to drag air

alono- with it, and I now, by request, will give a description of the action

of this siphon illustrated by a working model.

Before proceeding to describe the peculiarities of this siphon, it will

be well to say a few words generally as to self-acting siphons employed

for the intermittent discharge of fluids from vessels. The idea of em-

ploying siphons in this way is by no means new, and I may instance the

philosophical toy, called ' Tantalus's cup,' which many of us have seen

in our youth. In this cup there is a concealed siphon, which is brought

into action when the cup is raised to the mouth to drink, so that the
Awater sinks away from the lips and cannot be drunk.
                                                      self-acting

siphon has also been employed for emptying vessels used for measuring

water, as in Osier's and Bickley's self-recording rain gauges, as well as

on a large scale for reservoirs.

    The chief difficulty to be overcome in applying siphons in this way

is to start them or pnt them in action. In an ordinary siphon, such

as that shown in fig. 1, the siphon will not be put in action unless the

water in the vessel rises above the top of the bend of the siphon, and it

will be readily seen that if the siphon is of any size, this will require a

large accession of water in the tank, so that the siphon will not work

except in cases where there is a large flow of water.

This difficulty can, to a considerable extent, be overcome by dipping

the outer leg of the siphon in water, as shown in fig. 2. The water

which runs over the bend of the siphon will then drag a certain quantity

of air with it, and drive this air out at the lower mouth of the siphon,

and as the air cannot return in consequence of this mouth being sealed,

the air in the outer leg: is gradually reduced in tension below the
atmospheric pressure. Whether this partial exhaustion of the air in the

outer leg is sufficient to start the siphon, depends on the quantity of water

that runs over the siphon, but the quantity required will be much less

than if the outer end were open, and it will not be necessary for the water

in the vessel to rise above the top of the bend of the siphon.

Although the expedient of dipping the outer leg of the siphon in

water greatly induces the quantity necessary to start the siphon, the re-

quired quantity is still very considerable if the siphon is of any size, and

further expedients have therefore been adopted to reduce this quantity.

One of the simplest of these expedients is to have two siphons of different

sizes connected together by a tube at the crown, and so arranged that the

water runs through the smaller siphon first. The outer ends of both

siphons are dipped in water, the smaller siphon then starts with a com-

paratively small quantity, and afterwards by means of the connecting

tube exhausts the air from the larger siphon, and brings it also into
action. This method was adopted by Professor James Thomson, F.R.S.,
in 1860, for his jet pump, and it was also carried out on a large scale in
France in 1867, at the Reservoir de Mettersheim. In this latter case,
there are two siphons of about 28 inches in diameter, each of which is
put in action by a smaller siphon of 6 inches in diameter.

     This expedient, however, and several others which have been adopted,

leave much to be desired, as they are to a certain extent complicated,

and yet do not sufficiently reduce the quantity required for starting the

siphon to enable it to be used in many cases. The method which I am

now about to describe is both simpler and much more effective.

     In an extensive series of experiments which I tried some years ago

on siphons, with their outer legs dipped in water, I was much puzzled by

finding that the quantity of water necessary to put a siphon of given size

in action varied in the most unaccountable way at different times. The

only difference that could be perceived between the cases in which the
siphon started and those in which it did not start was, that in the former

case air-bubbles escaped freely at the mouth of the siphon, whereas in

the latter case, under apparently the same conditions, very few bubbles

came out. At last the idea suggested itself to me of making a portion of

the siphon in glass, so as to see what was going on inside the pipe, when

the cause of the irregularity was at once discovered. Sometimes the

water which ran over the bend adhered closely to the sides of the pipe; at

other times a portion of it would fall more or less clear of the sides. When

the water adhered to the sides it produced very little effect in displacing

the air, so that only a small quantity of air was driven through the water

at the mouth of the siphon. When, on the other hand, the water fell clear

of the sides, it produced a great effect iu displacing the air, and large

bubbles of air at once escaped from the mouth of the si*phon.

       Q
226 beport--1879.

      I pursued the investigation further by producing artificial irregularities
in the pipe, and I then found the more completely I could throw the
water clear of the sides of the pipe, the greater effect it produced in ex-
pelling the air and starting the siphon. The form of siphon which I
have finally adopted as most effective is shown in fig. 3, and in the
working model.

     The siphon consists of two concentric tubes, A and B, the outer one, A,
being closed at the top, and steadied and supported by three radial ribs
projecting from the inner tube, B. The annular space between A and B
constitutes the ascending or shorter leg of the siphon, and the inner tube,
B, the descending or longer leg. At the upper mouth of B is fixed a conical
shell, c, projecting inwards clear from the inner surface of the tube, B.
The lower mouth of B dips into a discharging trough, d, which has a weir,

--E, level with this lower mouth. The action is as follows : When the

vessel is full, the water begins to trickle over the edge of the conical shell,
c, and is so directed by the shell as to fall towards the centre of the tube,

B, quite clear of the sides, thus producing the maximum effect in displacing

the air. The action of the siphon soon commences, and continues till the
water in the tank is lowered to the level of the lower mouth of A, after
which air is admitted by that mouth to the siphon, and the action ceases.

     In some cases, the quantity of air admitted at the end of the discharge,
though sufficient to stop the siphon, is not sufficient to fully charge it with
air, so that the next discharge will commence before the water in the
vessel has risen to its full height. To obviate this, the best expedient is
a secondary siphon, f, fixed in the trough, d, and put into action by the
discharge from the larger siphon, A B. "When this discharge has stopped,
the siphon f continues in operation, so that the water in the trough, D, is
drawn off, the lower mouth of the pipe, B, unsealed, and the larger siphon
fully charged with air. Presently, also, the action of the secondary siphon,

f, is also stopped by the admission of air. When the vessel is filled, and

water trickles over the shell, c, the trough d is again filled up to the level
of the weir, and the siphon A B becomes sealed.

     There are other minor conditions which affect the commencement of

the automatic action of the siphon, such as the roughness of the top of the
conical shell c, the ratio of the area of the tank to the area of the siphon,
the length of the siphon, &c, but these I will not go into.

      In conclusion, it is evident that the above form of self-acting siphon
will be of great practical use for a number of purposes. I will merely
mention one, namely, that of flushing sewers, by means of small quantities
of water which ordinarily run to waste. Take, for instance, a drinking
fountain, the water which escapes from it is, under ordinary circumstances,
absolutely useless for flushing purposes. Collect this water, however, in
a tank with a large self-acting siphon, and as soon as the tank is full, be
it in one day or in several days, the siphon will be brought into action, and
the contents of the tank discharged with great rapidity. The trickle from

a drinking fountain would start a siphon of as much as 10 or 12 inches'

diameter of the improved form, and would, therefore, flush a sewer of

considerable size, say nearly 3 feet in diameter.

                                    in extenso among the Reports.]

                                                                                      [Plate XIV.]

In a communication to the Geological Section of the meeting of the British

Association at Plymouth in 1878 I called attention to the significance

of the result of the deep boring at Messrs. Meux's, as to the Upper
Devonian beds there met with, next beneath the cretaceous strata, also as

to the importance of some further knowledge as to the direction of the

-dip of the said Upper Devonian beds. An accurate acquaintance with this

point is essentially needed with reference to its immediate bearing on a

question which may possibly become one of national importance, namely,

the place of the true Coal-measure series, beneath our south-east area, and
which must serve as an excuse for another short communication on the

.same subject.

The question involved has attracted the attention of sundry foreign

geologists during the past year ; and upon our own area facts have been
ascertained which now enable us to arrive inferentially at what, but a

year since, was mere speculation.

M. Dewalque, at a meeting of the Belgian Geological Society, 1 remarked

first on the absence of Jurassic and Triassic deposits, as along the Palaeozoic

ridge extending from  the                                                        Ardennes by the    north    of France                                                 being just
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

what the borings at St. Trond, Laeken, Menin, and Ostende, would

indicate. Secondly, that inasmuch as the Belgian and north of France

primary formations are extended into England, it is an important point,

with reference to the prolongation of the Belgian coal-basin, that London
should be known to be situated immediately above a formation which is

itself so close to the Coal-measures. ' The supposition that the dip of
these Upper Devonian beds ' is to the south, and that they belong to the

extension of our northern basin, is that which is the most probable. The

coal formation may therefore occur at a short distance (quelques kilo-

metres) south of London, and at a workable depth.'

With a southern dip it maybe that these beds (Upper Devonian) belong

to the extension of our southern basin. In this case coal may occur in the
north as well as on the south, and nearer on this side (K) than on the

south. Should there be such a coal basin, it might be as useless as ours

(Belgian) of the ' Condros and the Entre Sambre and Meuse.' 2

In answer to some observations of M. J. Van Scherpenzeel Thim,

1 Societe Geologique de Belgiques, Bulletin LXV.

2 The exact significance of this latter alternative of the Belgian geologist may

not perhaps be understood by English geologists generally, as it has reference to a

feature in the physical structure of Belgium, but the which is very properly referred

to by M. Dewalque now that the Paheozoic band of the Continent is known to reach

our south-east district. The band of Belgian and North of France coal-measures

may be truly represented as trough-shaped, however produced.

The northern border of the coal basin of Namur is formed of strata each older
than the other in a northerly direction. The carboniferous series occurs at the sur-

face at  Soignies  and Journay                                                   the  Devonian at  Rhines ;  the Silurian  at                                          Gembloux.
                                                                              ;

To the north the Silurian strata sink--at Bruxelles they are at 200, and at 300 at.

Ostende. The primary formation of the North of Belgium undulates, and the like

may be supposed to be the arrangement here.

                                                                                      Q2
--228 report 1879.

M. Dewalque added : ' Starting from the supposition that our (Belgian)'
old strata are prolonged westward into England, and from the fact that
Upper Devonian strata occur under London, we are led to admit that the
band of Silurian slates of the Ostende boring must pass north of London.

These slates, which are referable to those of Tubise, must be separated
from Upper Devonian by other beds, such as the black slates of the Menin

shaft, which are Silurian. Considering the geographical position of

these three places, together with the east and west direction of our older

formations, it would not seem that their prolongation into England would

carry them sufficiently north of London, so that the Devonian beds there

should represent our Oondros basin, and not that of Namur.

' If then at that place (London) we are in a prolongation of the Namur

basin, the strata at Meux's must dip south ; consequently, it is most

probable that the Coal-measures are to be found at a short distance

south.'

Such were the inferences drawn by M. Dewalque in 1878 from the

result of boring at Messrs. Meux's.

It may be stated that at the several places named, the Palaeozoic strata

reached were,                                              at  Ostende,  Silurian                                       at Menin,  Silurian,  like the  strata  at
                                                                                                                     ;

Gambloux                                                   at Laeken,  also  Silurian.
                                                        ;

The supposition that the Silurian strata met with at Ostende would,

in their course westward, pass north of London has been proved by the

occurrence of beds of "Wenlock age at Ware, near Hertford, twenty miles

north of London. This discovery has come most opportunely to supply

the information which, only a year since, was needed as to the dip of the
Upper Devonian strata at Messrs. Meux's.

The succession of the Palaeozoic strata, on this the English side of the

Channel, even into the far west, is just what it is in Belgium and the
north of France. From Brussels and Ostende, from north to south, the

successive members of the series mostly rise to the surface, and are

exposed in all the valleys of denudation extending north from the line of

the Coal-measures, as long since laid down by Dumont.
    With this guidance, and in spite of little as yet known with respect to

our own underground structure on the south-east, it can be safely put in

relation with what obtains on the European continent for an extent of

400 miles. The order in which the successive members of the Palaeozoic

series rise to the surface from beneath one another there, may be taken as

our guide as to the order and relation of the Upper Devonian at the end

of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, and the section at Ware.
     The question of the strike and direction of the dip of the beds at

Meux's is now determined as forming part of the northern base of the

trough, containing first the mountain limestone series, and next, above,

the true Coal-measures.

For practical guidance one point alone remains to be considered: from

the place of the Upper Devonian strata in the heart of London, what must

be allowed for the breadth of the outcrop of the mountain limestone

series, next in sequence ?

In parts of Belgium the mountain limestone has been estimated as

600 feet thick ; it is less than that in easterly and westerly directions.
     The nearest place to London at which this is exposed is on the north

of the Boulonnais denudation, where, with its associated beds, it may be

put at 600 feet. The breadth of such a mass at its outcrop, and with an
angle of 30 to 35 degrees, such as the Devonian beds at Meux's had, would

be nearly doubled, or about 1200 feet ; in other words, tbe lower members
of tbe true Coal-measure formation may be fairly expected to occur at
about that distance south from the corner of Tottenham Court Road and
Oxford Street, the upper, or productive Coal measure, still farther to the

south.

    What has been ascertained beyond all doubt as to the line of section
underlying a part of our English area from London to Ware, may be

safely taken as holding good for a great extent of country on the east as
on the west. The ages of more modern overlying formations do not affect
this question, as is shown by the borings here in England, but more
abundantly on the European continent. In our attempts to trace accu-
rately hidden physical arrangements of the earth's crust, the restrictions

to be observed are the positive data of the ascertained thicknesses of the
several formations, and their positions, and which enable us to replace,

without much chance of error, the line of each band and of its direc-

tion of dip.

                       Hydrography, Past and Present
             By Lieutenant Gr. T. Temple, R.K, F.R.G.S.

          [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed
                                     in externa among the Keports.]

                                                    [Plate XV.]

The immediate aim of this paper is to bring to the notice of the section

the present state of hydrographical science, which forms an essential part
of the machinery by which our enormous commerce is carried on in time
of peace, and defended during war. The subject is therefore of great
national importance, and I sincerely trust that it will meet with your

favourable consideration.

     In the annual address to the Royal Geographical Society, the unsatis-
factory state of the Admiralty charts for South Africa was pointed out by
our President, Mr. Clements Markham, whose unremitting devotion to the

advancement of geographical science is well known to most of those

present. He observed that the war in Zulu-Land had called public

attention to the unsurveyed state of parts of the coast of South Africa,

H.M. Ships Active and Tenedos having been placed in great danger
through grounding on some unknown reefs between the Tugela River

and Point Durnford. He told us also that both the east and west coasts

of South Africa (northwards from Bashee River on one side, and
St. Helena Bay on the other) have not been sounded since the days of
Captain Owen, half a century ago. This must have been a startling

announcement to those who fancy that we already know the world
perfectly, and who are not aware that the outlines given on the beautiful
maps of Keith Johnston and others are, to a great extent, mere guess-
work. It was, however, well known to the few who for some years past

have been steadfastly working to restore the surveying branch of the

Uavy to the high position it formerly held.

     The story of this essential branch of the public service, which has
been characterised as ' not only useful in peace, but terrible in war,' is
·a curious illustration of the difficulties attendin·ge the construction and
230 eeport-- 1879.

maintenance of any thoroughly good institution. ' Inch by inch,' we are

told, did the surveying service ' fight its way into life,' until under the

bold and skilful rule of Sir Francis Beaufort, it achieved the success

prepared for it by the struggles and death of Dalrymple, and the earnest

efforts of Hurd, Michael Walker, and Parry.

Although many unsurveyed coasts were charted during the last

century by Cook, Vancouver, Flinders, and others, yet it was not until

1795 that the Hydrographical Department of the Admiralty was

established by Order in Council. It consisted of the hydrographer

(Mr. Dalrymple), one assistant, and a draughtsman. Mr. Dalrymple's

orders were 'to take charge and custody of such plans and charts as then

were, or should thereafter, be deposited at the Admiralty, and to select

and compile such information as might appear to be requisite for the

purpose of improving navigation.' From this small beginning, the

important department that may now be fairly regarded as the main

source of hydrographical information to the civilised world was developed.

myIt is impossible, in the limited time at  disposal, to trace the progress

of the department step by step ; it is also unnecessary, as full information

on the subject may be found in the Geographical Magazines for April and

July, 1874, and in the United Service Gazettes for the 12th and 26th of

July, and the 16th of August, 1879. It will be sufficient to say that after

many struggles and reverses it advanced slowly but surely, until the year

1849 found no less than twelve surveying ships in commission, under the

late eminent hydrographer Sir Francis Beaufort, while twenty-three

officers were borne on ships' books for detached surveying service. After

presiding over the Hydrographical Department for nearly a quarter of a

century, Sir Francis retired in 1854, leaving a surveying force of nineteen

captains and ten commanders, with sixteen lieutenants in training, and

eight ships in commission, notwithstanding the fact that we were then at
war with Russia, and that three surveying captains and two commanders

were employed in Arctic service. The views of a nation are supposed to

extend with its opulence and prosperity, but in the middle of 1873, the

surveying service had fallen so low that only one of Her Majesty's ships

(the Shearwater, under Commander "Wharton) was engaged in actual

surveying duties. It is true that the Challenger was also in commission

under Sir George Nares, but she was an exploring rather than a surveying

vessel. Since then matters have somewhat improved, but we still find a

decrease of ships and men where there should have been increase.

In January 1873 the sad falling-off in the surveying service was.

noticed in the press, a leader in the Daily News showing that, although

the annual naval expenditure had increased from about four and a half

to seven and a half millions, and the tonnage of the mercantile navy from

less than four and a half to upwards of seven million tons, yet the

surveying service had been allowed to decline. In December of the same

year. Sir Bartle Frere wrote to Mr. Gladstone, earnestly protesting against

the insinuation that voyages of survey and discovery were not ' strictly

professional naval services ; ' at the same time expressing his belief that

there are few better naval schools than a surveying or discovery ship,
and that if such ships were multiplied, not only would commerce benefit,,

but men-of-war would be better supplied with practical seamen than is

possible at present. In April 1874, Mr. Markham pointed out, in the

Geographical^ Magazine, the great need that our rulers should more

fully appreciate the importance of an efficient administration of the
                       HYDROGRAPHY, PAST AND PRESENT.           231

surveying service ; and expressed an earnest hope that the days of false

economy and lamentable neglect of enterprises of discovery and survey

were numbered. In the following July he showed that although one

of the most obvious duties of a country with an extensive seaboard and

a great sea-borne trade is to provide for the safety of vessels frequenting

her ports, by the provision of lighthouses and buoys, and, above all, by

the preparation of reliable charts and sailing directions, yet nothing had

been done for a space of twelve years for the coasts of our Indian Empire.

In February 1875, Captain Hull read an able paper at the Royal United

Service Institution, in which he especially drew attention to the un-

surveyed parts of the world. The Army and Navy Gazette has also taken

the matter up, and on the 22nd of last March published a letter from

« An Old Officer,' headed ' The One Man Needful.' This letter pointed out

that when a competent successor to the late Admiral Bedford was

required at the Board of Trade, it appeared that such a man was not to

be found in England. The only man said to be fit was Sir George Nares,

who was then in command of the Alert surveying the Straits of Magellan.

Sir George, who is apparently a sort of hydrographic Sir Garnet

Wolseley, was accordingly taken out of the Alert, just as in 1874 he was

taken out of the Challenger to command the Arctic Expedition, in both
cases leaving his work to be carried on by his executors, or the men he

left behind him. The reason for this is obvious ; in place of the nine and

twenty captains and commanders, from whom, in 1854, competent men

might have been selected either to command Arctic expeditions, to fill the

place of Admiral Bedford at the Board of Trade, or that of Sir George

Nares in the Straits of Magellan, we have now only two. One great evil

arising from the want of trained men of the required rank is that the

surveying service continually suffers demoralisation from the appointment

of inexperienced chiefs, who are obliged to learn their duties from their

juniors, a proceeding curiously at variance with the general tone of this

age of competition.

    At the present time the Hydrographical Department of the Admiralty

consists of twenty-four individuals, including the hydrographer and four

messengers and packers. The expenses of the department are provided

for under Vote V, whieh includes several other branches of the scientific

service. The total grant for the scientific branch was 120,35 71. in

1861-62, and 106,04R in 1878-79, a deplorable redaction of more than

14,000Z., which represents a proportionate decrease in the amount of

useful work done. And yet, as I shall presently show, the Hydrographic

Office is in a great measure self-supporting, and might be made still more

so by the ordinary mercantile expedient of increasing the size of an

establishment to meet the requirements of customers.

    It is beyond the scope of this paper to enter fully into the manifold

--duties of the department, but amongst the most important are the follow-

ing: To execute accurate surveys of all parts of the world that are
visited by British ships ; to prepare and publish these surveys in the form

of charts ; to write and publish sailing directions to accompany the charts ;

to  collect, compile,  and promptly publish  all  hydrographic  information
                                                                                                                       ;

and to keep the charts and other nautical documents corrected up to the

latest dates. It is also the duty of the department not only to supply

Her Majesty's ships, but also to see that there are always sufficient

charts and nautical works to meet the public demand. It will give some

idea of the extent of this demand to state that on an average upwards of
                                                                                                                                                             ;

232 report-- 1879.

106,000 copies of Admiralty charts, and nearly 19,000 copies of the

Nautical Almanac, besides sailing directions and other books, are sold

annually to the general public and to foreign governments, exclusive of

the supply to the Royal Navy. Four hundred and fifty chart boxes, each

containing from 300 to 400 charts, are required for the Navy, and 1000

chronometers are in constant circulation between the Royal Observatory

and Her Majesty's ships. Foreign navies navigate by our charts, and all

our sailing directions are immediately translated, especially by the French

authorities. Another important function of the department is its respon-

sibility for all matters connected with the compasses of Her Majesty's

ships.

The preparation of charts is under a superintendent, whose duties are

of a very important and responsible character. They are ably performed
by Commander Thomas A. Hull, who received his early education in the

school of Sir Francis Beaufort, and whose abilities as sailor, surveyor,

and draughtsman are well known. I have here a few Admiralty charts

selected to give a general idea of the different styles. They may be

divided into five classes : ocean charts, general charts of any particular

country or coast, coast charts, plans of harbours, and physical charts.
The latter have given a greater impetus to our knowledge of the causes
and effects of winds, currents, and temperatures than any publications that

have preceded them, and they have already been reproduced in France

and other countries. In the course of a voyage the sailor uses four

classes of charts. Fixing his position by astronomical observations, he

marks the ship's place and her track from day to day upon the ocean

chart, which is drawn on a very small scale. The curved lines on these

charts represent the lines of equal magnetic variation, and the small

figures  show  the deep-sea soundings                                                                                                        these  are  of  the greatest value to
                                                                                                                                          ;

our merchants, and to those interested in the laying of submarine cables.

They are also the result of great care and experience, as the ship must

be kept for hours in the same position to obtain them, telegraph engi-

neers requiring not only accurate position and depth of water, but also

samples of the bottom at great depths. They want to know what kind

of bed their cables are to lie upon. As the land is neared, larger scales

are required, and the next chart used is the general chart of the country

the vessel is bound to. When in sight of land, a coast sheet is prepared

and last of all comes the plan of the haven in which the weather-beaten

ship is to rest.

    When a coast has only been partially surveyed, the charts for it are

drawn in a light and unfinished style, which is a sufficient warning to

the initiated that the land must be approached with caution. As the great
aim of the Hydrographic Department is correctness, all charts are sub-

jected to the searching criticism of the naval assistants before publica-

tion, and it is to this measure that their extreme accuracy is to a great
extent due. The charts are not by any means done with when issued

they have then to be kept up to date. In fact, every chart published may

be regarded as a sort of official child, requiring the paternal vigilance of

the office to insure its doing good instead of evil. Correcting the charts

is a very delicate and responsible duty. All changes of lights, buoys, and

beacons have to be inserted, and as there are in round numbers 4000
lights and 10,000 buoys to be watched over, it is no trifling task. The
change of a single light or buoy sometimes necessitates the correction of
no less than five charts. These corrections, though small, must be made
             HYDROGRAPHY, PAST AND PRESENT.                           233

with the greatest care, for if such important simplicities are neglected, and

the chart be incorrect in these essentials, no finish or cunning engraving

can save its credit ; it is beauty without discretion, a danger instead of a

Asafeguard.  very slight error in the position, colour, or character, of a

light or buoy, or in the insertion of a simple dot, cross, or figure, may

lead to the gravest disasters. Charts, like books, require study to be

properly understood, and familiarity with the abbreviations and conven-

Ational signs is essential.                               good chart, to those who study it with the

Myattention it deserves, is ' a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.'  life

has been saved more than once by Admiralty charts, and therefore I

speak of them with affection. From six to twelve copies of each chart

are kept in the office for correction, and as there are about 2700 charts in

circulation, the number collected at one time on the shelves may exceed

30,000. The assertion of the Daily News that ' space is wanted to spread

out a chart, without having first to remove books or papers that are at

the same time under consideration,' is literally true. At the Depot des

Cartes et Plans de la Marine, in Paris, a greater amount of space is

allotted to the British charts alone than the English Admiralty affords

for those of the whole world. Prom the sale of charts the Treasury re-

ceives about 6000L a year ; but though the number of charts increases

yearly, though the work required is more finished and elaborate, and

though the demand and sale have also increased, there is no cor-

responding addition to the staff employed. The Hydrographer's Report

for 1878-79 tells us that during the year sixty-one new charts and

plans were published, 1950 charts were corrected, and 202,800 charts

were printed for Her Majesty's service and for the use of the general

public. Although the maximum of work which this branch of the office

manages to perform with a minimum of hands is truly surprising, yet

the present staff, which consists of a chief draughtsman and five assist-

ants, is unequal to the demands upon it, and the unpublished informa-

tion is steadily accumulating. The result is that insurance is high,

and that valuable cargoes, and still more valuable lives, are thrown

away in order that the already narrow limits of the scientific vote may

be still further contracted. It is true that this vote has been reduced by

a few  thousands but how                                  much did it cost to repair the Lord Clyde and
                                                       ;

the Agincourt, and how many vessels are annually lost on partially sur-

veyed or little-known coasts ?

Having now sketched the constitution and working of the Hydro-

graphical Department, I shall endeavour to show what it is now doing,

and what remains to be done. On the outline chart of the world which

accompanies this paper, an attempt has been made to depict, faithfully,

the present state of hydrography, and I fear it will be only too easy to

show that a surveying Alexander need not weep. The surveyed coasts

are marked by a heavy coast line ; those only partially surveyed, by
shading; while coasts that have merely been explored ai'e drawn in

fine outline. The ships show the stations of the four regular surveying

vessels and three schooners at present in commission ; and the crosses
show the head-quarters of officers doing their best with small craft, or

with hired boats and crews, the latter method being adopted, where

practicable, with a view to economy. In some cases the expenses are

shared by Colonial Governments.

     Owing to the vastness of the subject, I fear that errors will be de-

tected in the chart by sailors knowing the respective coasts ; I shall be
234 report-- 1879.

only too glad to find that the heavy coast line should be extended, but I
trust that no one will be able to remove any of that line or the shading.

     The large cross in the Bay of Bengal represents the Department
recently established in India for Marine Surveys, and which will be men-

tioned hereafter.

    On the home coast there is one small surveying vessel, the Porcupine,

under Staff- Captain Parsons, as well as the hired steamer, Knight Errant,.

under Staff- Commander Stanley. It should be borne in mind that owing

to their shifting nature the sands surrounding our shores require constant
examination, while the mouths of rivers are often as changeable as the

fashions. The continuous attention of a strong surveying staff is there-
fore indispensable, if the charts of our own coasts are to be kept in good
working order. It is not enough to make a road and then leave it, or to
lay down rails and then neglect the permanent way. The same principle
applies to our ocean highways, and charts, like roads, require constant
attention and repair to prevent them from falling into decay.

    The Alert left England in September last under the command of Sir

--George Nares, and reached the scene of her first year's labours Magellan
--Strait and the adjacent waters early in January. Sir George, as already

observed, has since accepted an appointment at the Board of Trade.
     The Fawn, under Commander Wharton, after determining the position

of the Cosmoledo group, and other islands to the north-west of Mada-

gascar, has been transferred, at the request of Admiral Sir Geoffrey
Hornby, to the unsurveyed waters of the Sea of Marmora.

     The Magpie has been employed on the sea-board of China, between
Hong-Kong and Shanghai, and is now in the Gulf of Tong-King, while
the Sylvia, under Commander Pelham Aldrich, is steadily working on

the western shores of Japan.

    It is much to be regretted that a very important part of the comple-
ment of officers in these vessels is generally overlooked. The well-known
labours of Sir Wyville Thomson and his staff lead us to hope that the

surveying ships of the future will carry a skilled naturalist, as in the

days of Sir Francis Beaufort. The opportunities offered by a surveying
vessel for observing and collecting on distant and little-known coasts,
such as those of East Africa and Japan, are so exceptional that we can
only wonder at their being neglected. In other respects, also, an amount
of economy is now enforced which impairs efficiency.

     Staff- Commander Maxwell, in the hired steamer Gulnare, is working
in Newfoundland, and the shores of Jamaica are being surveyed by

Lieutenant Pullen, in the schooner Sparroivhawh.

     Lieutenant Moore, in the Alacrity schooner, is following up the
examination of the Fiji Islands and Lieutenant Richards, in the schooner

                                                                                                                                                                     ;

Renard, is under the orders of the commodore of the Australian station.
The Hydrographer observes that the useful surveying work performed

among dangerous reefs, in these two small sailing vessels, deserves warm

commendation.
     The Queensland coast survey, under Staff-Commander Bedwell, is

now being pressed forward in a hired steamer. Staff-Commander
Howard is working on the mainland in the neighbourhood of Nuyts
Archipelago and Fowler Bay ; and we are also told by the Hydrographer
that Staff- Commander Archdeacon, with one naval assistant, has been

working hard for six years in Western Australia, with ' limited nautical

resources.'' Now this phrase is worthy of special notice. It means that

the surveyors cannot always get small craft wherein to obtain soundings,

and however truly a coast may be delineated, the charts are almost

useless unless the soundings are correct. In fact, soundings, which
represent the depth and bottom of the sea, constitute the great point of
difference between a chart and a map, and it is upon their accuracy that
the character of the nautical surveyor mainly depends. The land work

may be done by the soldier or civil engineer, but the sounding is the

sailor's portion, requiring all the ready wit and tact of his profession.

Well-sounded localities may be safely navigated by means of the lead, a

simple but very important instrument, which is only too frequently

--neglected. In thick weather the lead and line are to the sailor as

antennae to a beetle though blinded by 'any vile congregation of

vapours,' he may still feel his way. Another great disadvantage of
detached surveying parties is that we lose that grand school for practical

nautical surveying, a ship, and the disciplined life of a man-of-war. 'No
man,' says Captain Hull, in his useful treatise on surveying, 'can be
expected to attain a trusted position as a nautical surveyor who is not
essentially a good officer and sailor, or, to speak more exactly, a good

pilot, knowing how to handle a body of men, the requirements of a ship,
and the room she wants to wear, stay, or anchor in. This knowledge

cannot be acquired under the ' one-man- and-a-boy ' system. It is in

ships only that men can discover 'the secrets of the sea,' or, to quote

Longfellow,

                                    Only those who brave its dangers
                                       Comprehend its mystery.

    Now Mr. Laughton observes, in his work on nautical surveying, that

' acquaintance with both the practice and theory of surveying is a
necessary part of the training of every naval officer, without which he
cannot have an intelligent understanding of the charts, the methods of
using them, and the confidence to be placed in them.' It is also a
favourite dictum of Admiral Ryder's that a fair surveyor must be a good
navigator. The battle of the Nile could never have been fought at the
hour it was if Nelson had not been a pilot as well as an Admiral. At
Copenhagen, also, he made a rough survey of the approaches, and waa

thus able to take his squadron close to the batteries.

    In the ' Navy List ' for August we find that only fifty-three officers
are now employed on surveying service, and if we exclude those working

under the Indian Department the total is reduced to forty-nine, or but
little more than half the number left by Sir Francis Beaufort a quarter

of a century ago.

     While the surveying service has thus been steadily retrograding, the
energy of the British merchant and shipowner has almost annihilated

distance. With your permission, therefore, we will just run round the
world, noting the surveyed and unsurveyed coasts as we pass them, and
I will try to make our voyage at least one of the shortest on record.

      Although the dark line naturally prevails over European coasts, yet

before we are out of the Bay of Biscay we come to the shading that

 necessitates caution, the shores of the Peninsula being still only partially

surveyed. Madeira and the Canaries may be considered as done ; the

 Cape de Verd Islands, however, require further examination.
     Passing the West Indies, where the greater portion of San Domingo

and Porto Rico require surveying, we first anchor at Bahia, a surveyed

port, with, however, some unexamined shoal ground on the western side

of the entrance.

    Pushing onward to Rio, we are still on the dark line, but on leaving

that beautiful harbour we enter a partially surveyed region until we

come to the River Plate, of which a survey is much required.
     During the voyage to Cape Virgins we have time to pay a respectful

tribute to the memory of Admiral Robert FitzRoy, who with limited

means, and in a marvellously short time, mapped the coast of South

America from the River Plate in the Atlantic to the Guayaquil in the

Pacific. Sir Francis Beaufort reported to the House of Commons, in

1848, that ' all that is immediately wanted of these shores has been

already achieved by the splendid survey of Captain Robert FitzRoy.'

That, however, was before the days of steamships 375 feet long, and

before the Strait of Magellan was the high road to the Pacific Ocean.

Entering the Strait of Magellan, our charts carry us safely on for

110 miles, when we again come to partially surveyed ground.

   We should like to continue our voyage by the inner channels leading

northward from Magellan, but as there are orders from the owners

against using these partially surveyed waters, we are reluctantly forced

into the Pacific (an ocean by no means worthy of its name in the vicinity

of Cape Pillar) with a loss of fuel and comfort, and much wear and tear

of ship and engines. The rapidly increasing traffic of large and powerful

steamers between Europe and the western coasts of America, points to the

urgent necessity for a thorough survey of Magellan Strait, and the

channels leading northward to the Gulf of Pefias.

Pursuing our way along the coast of Chili, whose increasing trade

with this country would be much benefited by better charts, we touch at

Valparaiso, Callao, and Payta ; but we cannot place reliance on our charts
until we reach the River Guayaquil. The sight of this coast reminds us
how the Independencia, pounding along with vicious intent to ram and

utterly annihilate the Covadonga, suddenly found herself on the reef which

her clever opponent avoided, and so lost the day and herself too. It was

pilotage and cool nerve, not gunnery, that enabled the little wooden ship

to cause the destruction of Peru's finest and most powerful ironclad, and

the moral is that though ships and guns may be brought to perfection,

yet they will avail nothing without skilled pilots and trustworthy

charts.

    From Guayaquil to Panama we are on the dark line, therefore, venturing
nearer to the shore, we can coast along one of the most beautiful and

interesting parts of the globe, passing La Plata island, where Drake

divided the spoils of the Cacafuego. ' In sea-divinity,' it has been

quaintly said, ' the case was clear, the King of Spain's subjects had

undone Mr. Drake, and therefore Mr. Drake was entitled to take the best

Wesatisfaction he could on the subjects of the King of Spain.'  also pass

Gallo island, where Pizarro drew the famous line on the sand, over which

(as we are told by Mr. Markham in his ' Reports on the Discovery of

Peru ') sixteen of his followers crossed.

Entering the Bay of Panama, we pass the beautiful Pearl Islands,

which have been well described as a perfumed archipelago, lying like

baskets of flowers on the tranquil surface of the ocean. To the eastward

lies the Gulf of San Miguel, where Balboa, after a journey of twenty-five

days across swamps, rivers, and woods, took possession of the Pacific

Ocean in the name of the King of Spain and the Indies. A branch of

the cold Peruvian current renders the temperature pleasanter here than it

is at a distance from the coast, but during the wet season ' it pours,' says

old Dampier, ' as out of a sieve.'

Before leaving Panama, let us reflect upon the advantage to English

commerce of continuing the survey, begun by Sir Henry Kellett, from

Guayaquil to Cape Pillar. The trade of this part of South America has

enormously increased since the introduction of steam. The enterprise of

the Pacific Steam Navigation Company has diverted the trade from the

Isthmus of Panama towards the Strait of Magellan, and this new stream

of travel and commerce has been so successful that the Company's fleet of

magnificent steamships is barely sufficient to meet the demands upon it.

In 1874, 524 voyages on the coast and 124 to Europe, were made by the

various steamers of six different companies.

Looking northward from Panama, there is much work to be done.

The rising trade of the Central American ports calls for more attention to

coasts of which we have little information since the days of Malaspina in

A1794.  partial survey of the coast and Gulf of California has been made

by officers of the United States Navy, who are, I believe, about to extend

their operations to the southward.

In the North Pacific our chart of that important group, the Sandwich

Islands, is said to be ' from various but imperfect authorities,' and some-

Wething better than this is required in 1879.  may also notice that Queen

Charlotte Island is only explored.

    Leaving Panama, we pass the Galapagos, where nothing is imme-
diately required, and come next to the Low Archipelago, where the three

symbols are blended. Here we find that the ocean roads followed by

vessels from Panama and Valparaiso, through dangerous patches of coral,

are sadly in need of repair.

After touching at the beautiful and famous Tahiti, we pass through

the Friendly Islands and our new colony of Fiji, rejoicing to see Lieutenant

Moore hard at work with his smart little schooner, for reliable charts are

much wanted here to clear away doubtful dangers.

Readers of Dickens will remember how Quilp, when despatching

Sampson Brass home one night in what sailors call a pea-soup fog, con-

ducts his guest to the door, and tells him the way lies through a lane in

which there is a savage dog, who generally lives on the right-hand side,
but at times conceals himself on the left ready for a spring. He cautions

Brass to take great care of himself, blows out the light, slams the door,

and leaves him. "What a splendid hydrographic official Daniel Quilp

would have made ! To tell a man there is a rock in a certain passage,

and not to tell him where it is, is virtually to block up that passage, and

the caution is of little use except to some comfortable official, who, if

anything happens, is able to look wise and say ' I told you so.'

    After calling at Sydney, where we hear that the coasts of New

Zealand are still unfinished, we find that the islands and dangers in the

much-used routes between Australia and China are a constant source of

anxiety, and it is not until we are northward of the Caroline Islands that

our captain is able to go below and take off his boots, in which for some

time past he has been obliged to sleep.

After visiting Hong Kong and Singapore, we pass through the

Malacca Strait to the Indian Ocean, impressed with the idea that the

Magpie and Sylvia have got their work cut out for them in those great

seats of industry China and Japan.
                                                                                                           ;

Thanks to the unflagging energy of Mr. Clements Markham, we leave

the Indian coasts to the able treatment of Captain Taylor and his well-

organised staff; bat as the Indian Marine Survey forms the subject of a

separate paper in this section I shall not further allude to it.

    We have no time to visit the east coast of Africa ; and the state of

the charts, as illustrated by the Active and Tenedos, would render it

imprudent to do so under any circumstances. When reading of the

important services lately rendered by Captain Campbell and his Active

brigade, it is humiliating to reflect that they might have been lost to us,

and gained by the submarine fleet, in order to save the expense of

executing a much-needed survey.

   The Red Sea being unfortunately shaded, we are unable to use the

inshore passages, except in the Mussawa Channel, and consequently

suffer much discomfort from the violence of the winds. The trade through

the Suez Canal points to the necessity for connecting the surveys of the

Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Suez.

In the Mediterranean, we notice with regret, mingled with surprise,

that the coast of Karamania is only partially surveyed, and that the

shading also extends from Alexandria to Sphax in Tunis, the black spot

representing the harbour of Tripoli.

Being by this time hardy travellers, we decide on a trip across the

North Sea before the end of the season, and therefore land at Brindisi and

make the best of our way to Hull, marvelling much at the immense tracts

of coast that are still unsurveyed.

    I need hardly remind you that amongst other things we are indebted

to Scandinavia for large quantities of timber and iron, or that the iron
from the Dannemora mines supplies us with our finest steel. The people

also, and especially those of Norway, are peculiarly interesting to the
British nation. They have, morally and politically, a claim upon us ; and

among them we may trace the germ of perhaps nearly all the free institu-

tions which distinguish the British Constitution at the present day.

   We leave Hull with a fair wind, but meet with a heavy north- westerly

gale off  the coast of  Norway                                    and  after  an anxious night,  daylight  finds
                                                               ;

us, partially disabled, driving rapidly towards a formidable iron-bound

shore, fronted by rocks above and below water. Our case seems desperate

we cannot get out to sea, and pilots cannot get out to us ; the Admiralty
charts are practically useless, for they are on a very small scale, and we

are now dashing before sea and wind towards a terrible line of breakers.

The captain is out on the bowsprit, however, and fortunately discovers an

rocks, by a miracle as it seems, and at last a pilot boat sheers cautiously

Aalongside.  rope is thrown to her, the pilot ties it round his body,

plunges into the sea, and is hoisted on board. The danger is now past,

and in half an hour more we are safely at anchor, deeply thankful for our

narrow escape from the horrors of shipwreck.

    Now this incident has actually occurred more than once, and has only

too frequently ended in the loss of ship and crew. Excellent charts for

this coast are published by the Norwegian Government, but as far as

English seamen are concerned it is but little better than explored. The

Norwegian charts, with a book of sailing directions in manuscript and

slip, are at this moment lying unused on the shelves of the Hydrographical

WhyOffice.   are they not published ? Because, for ' departmental
-- --reasons ' mark the phrase it has been decided that they are ' to stand

over.' Of these, and similar documents, we may say, in the words of the

old Scotch song, that

                                      Wives and mithers maist despairin'

                              GV them lives o' men.

     Apart from humane considerations, the new branch of commerce that
has been opened in Siberia, and our increasing trade with Norway, which

is already worth nearly five millions a year, would appear to justify the
small additional outlay that would be required to publish work that has

already been done, and paid for. I am quite sure that neither the

Government nor the public have realised the state of things that I have
endeavoured to set before you, and that if it could only be made clear to
them, fewer ships would be wrecked on the dangerous shoals called ' de-

partmental reasons.'
      I hope I have succeeded in proving that hydrographical information

is urgently needed by our merchants, and by their fleets, while the fate of
the Independencia, and the narrow escape of the Active and Tenedos, clearly
show that it is required by our Navy. Both duty and interest call upon
us to provide this information to the utmost extent of our power, for
hardly a ship floats that does not in some way carry British interests, and,
as the First Lord of the Admiralty publicly said only a few weeks ago,
* our national greatness is principally due to the fact that we have a larger
mercantile marine than any other nation.'

      In the words of a great English Minister, ' I refer it alike to the

hearts and understandings of those who hear me, and of those out of
doors who will consider our discussions, whether we should not shrink
from our duty, and disgrace the memory of those who have gone before
ns, if we were to hesitate to say that we would provide for the wants of
the day in which we live ? I am not addressing you in unconsciousness

of the increase made to the Army and Navy Estimates, which unforeseen

circumstances have rendered of immediate necessity, but in considering
the amount of estimates voted, I would say, it is not the amount to be
considered, but the national exigencies imperatively required for the

country's safety.'

     This is essentially a humane and industrial, and in no way a party

question, and I would earnestly appeal to you to use your influence for the
restoration of the Surveying Service to the prominent position it ought

to hold among the forces of civilisation, and to protect it in some measure
from those blasts of ruinous economy which occasionally sweep over our
country. By increasing the number of surveying ships, and extending to

navigation and nautical surveying a fair share of the encouragement so
freely bestowed on ship-building and great-gun-founding, you would
establish a first-rate finishing school, which would produce not only
 nautical surveyors, but superior officers for the general service ; and, in
 giving your naval officers the opportunity of practising afloat what they
 learn at Greenwich, you would enable them more efficiently to protect the
 trade they would be helping to extend.

      I trust that the country will take this matter up ; that before long the
 commander-in-chief of every station will have a properly equipped sur-
 veying ship at his disposal ; and that the Hydrographical Department
 may be extended to enable it to keep pace with the wants of the times,

--and to publish and circulate the stores of valuable or rather invaluable

 information, that are now shelved for ' departmental reasons.' While

the idleness engendered by a long interval of peace ; that idleness which,
like a slow poison, little by little wears away the strength and valour of a
nation. They would be advancing civilisation, extending knowledge, and
exciting friendly interest and sympathy throughout the world, thus help-
ing to consummate the high aspiration

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 1879.

       The President delivered tlie following Address :

In order that we may understand the present position of Natural Science upon
the Earth, we must remember that the universe is in itself one great whole, which
includes minds no less than bodies, for thought is as much a phenomenon of what
really exists as motion. But though the universe be but one, man with his limited

powers is unable to treat it as such, but has to push his investigation of Nature

when and where he can. Thus have arisen many sciences which were at first quite
isolated. Their separate condition is a mark of the feebleness of our powers of

investigation. Their gradual convergence, and especially where any complete con-
tact can be established between them, is the mark that our advancing knowledge is
penetrating deeper.

    That there are many sciences of Nature, instead of one science of Nature, has its
relation, then, to human imperfection. But the coalescence of sciences has com-

menced, and is steadily taking place ; magnetism is no longer isolated from electri-
city, nor light from heat, nor the power of thinking from the condition of the brain.

In all such cases we have got nearer to understanding what is really going on in
Nature. There are already many such achievements of science ; but, nevertheless,
it remains true that human powers of investigation are so narrow, and the use we
have made of them up to the present is so short of what we may reasonably look

for in the future, that the sciences of Nature are still many, and most of them stand
lamentably aloof from one another.

   We find, then, in the present passing condition of our knowledge, one group

of sciences which investigate the phenomena of consciousness; another distinct
group of the biological sciences ; and a third, the group of the physical sciences.
These are all but parts of the one great investigation of Nature, but for the present
they exist almost disconnected, as separate provinces of human inquiry.

    When we endeavour to investigate mental phenomena, we are encountered by

the complexity and remoteness of the effects which present themselves for exami-
nation, and by a deep and impenetrated obscurity hanging over the interval
between them and their causes. In order to make any progress even in the sub-
ordinate task of tracing out the relations of these effects to one another, the inquirer
finds it necessary to venture upon hypothesis, and in all metaphysical speculation

we sadly miss that healthy discipline with which Nature in other branches of

science relentlessly refutes our hypotheses if they are wrong. Here, then, is a

region in which the plausible may be mistaken for the true ; and it is unfor-
tunately certain that it has sometimes been so mistaken by the ablest human

minds.

                             report 1879.

The biological sciences treat of all the phenomena of living beings, except

their mental phenomena, which are those which lie most remote from their causes.

Here the complication is less, but it is still too great for the human mind to have
Weyet penetrated behind it.
                             are still occupied with phenomena which lie at a

Wetreat distance from their real causes.  are accordingly still far beyond the

rano-e of the exact sciences. Most of the great discoveries of biological science

have been made by estimating the general drift of what is taught by a vast num-

ber of particular facts. This, it will be observed, is a kind of reasoning that
is necessarily more or less inexact, 1 and, as a consequence, it is one which requires
wide intellectual training and great experience and tact to handle it with safety.

When the investigator has brought these qualifications to his task, astonishing

progress has been made in these sciences : without them the reasoning may degrade

into being either trivial or loose.

    In the rest of the study of Nature we are not embarrassed by the phenomena of

life, and many mysteries therefore stand aside out of our path. Here lies the
domain of the physical sciences. It is here that the mind of man has best been

able to cope with the realities of the universe, and in which its greatest achieve-

ments have been effected. It is here that exact reasoning finds a predominant

place.

     The study of the physical sciences has been remitted by the British Association

to its first two sections, chemistry being assigned to Section B, and the rest of the

Aphysical sciences to Section A. Accordingly, Section includes the whole range

of mathematics, along with the study of the conditions of rest and motion in that

part of matter which is endowed with mass, and of the phenomena of sound, heat,

lio-ht, and electricity, with the applications of these abstract sciences in molecular

physics and to astronomy, crystallography and meteorology.

In meteorology, owing to the complication of the materials that have to be

dealt with, we must have frequent recourse to the same kind of reasoning as has

been found so effectual in the biological sciences ; but in the other physical sciences

which I have enumerated exact reasoning prevails, and on this account they are

frequently classed together as the exact sciences.

The process of investigation in the exact sciences is fundamentally one in all

cases. It has been well described by Mill in the third book of his ' Logic' Never-

theless, it is notorious that minds which are well fitted for some branches of

-- --physical inquiry find difficulty sometimes insuperable difficulty in pursuing

others. It is not every eminent mathematician who would have made an equally

good chemist, or vice versa. This is because there exists a practical distinction

separating the investigations of exact science into two well-marked classes when

they are viewed, not as they are in themselves, but in their relation to the powers

of us human beings. I refer to the distinction between the experimental method

or the method of observation, on the one  hand                     and the deductive  method, or the
                                                                ;

method of reasoning, on the other. All valid investigations in exact science appeal

to what can be directly perceived, and all lead to a conclusion which can be

reasoned out from it ; but there are some of these investigations in which the main

difficulty consists in making the appeal to the senses, and there are others in which

the main difficulty lies in the process of reasoning.

To contend with these difficulties successfully requires very different qualities

of mind and body. In experimental science the powers, principally called into

requisition are readiness and closeness of observation, dexterity in manipulation,

skill in contriving expedients, accuracy in making adjustments, and great patience.
It also requires that the investigator should have an accurate memory of what else
he has witnessed resembling the phenomenon under observation, that he should be

quick to detect every point of agreement and difference that can be perceived, and
be skilful to select those which are significant, and to employ them as materials

for prevision to guide his further proceedings. But the strain on the reasoning

    1 Except when the reasoning takes a form in which its strength can be gauged

by the doctrine of probabilities. The most satisfactory instance of this is that
' statistical method ' which has proved our most searching tool in molecular physics.

 powers is generally less, often of trifling amount. The question is put to Nature,
 and it is Nature usually that gives the bulk of the answer. The most striking
 monument of splendid achievements by the experimental method of investigation
  unaided by the deductive method is to be found in the science of chemistry.

     An equally typical instance of the power of the deductive method is the science

 of mechanics. This science, which has sunk deeper into the secrets of Nature than

 any other science, and which is the science towards whom all other physical

 sciences are at present more or less gravitating, is essentially deductive. There is
 little or no difficulty about its fundamental data. They are facts of Nature so
 patent to all men, and so indelibly implanted in human conception, that some

 persons have supposed that we have an intuitive perception of them. But, while

 the materials from which the mind is to work are thus easily obtained, it has taxed
 to the utmost the reasoning powers of understandings like Newton's to evolve the
 few consequences of them which are already known, and the investigator has to

 call to his assistance every aid to prolonged consecutive thought which mathe-

 maticians can devise.

      In grappling with the problems of Nature we are seldom allowed the choice of
 the method of investigation we shall employ. This is commonly settled for us and
 not by us. Where we cannot advance without further information, we must make
 further observations, i.e., we must employ the experimental method, the appeal ad
 experientiam : where we cannot advance without understanding better what the
information we possess really amounts to, we must employ the deductive method.

     No reach of intellect applied to the materials in existence before 1860 could

 have elicited the fact that iron exists upon the sun. This great discovery was
made by Professor Kirchhoff, a scientific man who was equally versed in both
methods of investigation. On the present occasion it was the experimental method
he employed. He applied to the scrutiny of the sun's spectrum four prisms of the
most homogeneous glass that could be procured, figured with the greatest accuracy

that the eminent artist Steinheil could attain. He expended far more pains

on their adjustment for each successive part of the spectrum than any of his
predecessors had done, and he was rewarded by a more perfect vision of the sun's

glorious spectrum than had met the human eye before. In a collateral inquiry,
suggested by an observation made by Foucault, he and Bunsen placed a metallic

vapour emitting bright rays in front of a still brighter incandescent body, so that

the light from the brighter background had to pass through this vapour, and they

found that the vapour now caused dark lines in the spectrum occupying the
positions which its own bright lines had before filled. Professor Kirchhoff there-

upon added an appliance to his spectroscope which enabled him to bring a metallic
spectrum and the solar spectrum together into the field of view, alongside of one
another. On accomplishing this he saw sixty of the brightest of the iron rays as

continuations of sixty of the strongest of the dark lines in the sun's spectrum
and, by an elaborate scrutiny, he satisfied himself that the observations had been

pushed to a sufficient degree of exactness to make sure that a deviation would have
been detected in any one of these sixty cases if it had amounted to as much as one-

fourth of the average interval between consecutive lines of the solar spectrum.

From this it was obvious that the sixty coincidences are not due to chance, but

indicate that there is really iron vapour in the path of the rays. It will be observed
that Kirchhoff's great merit and the real difficulty of his work lay in the scientific
foresight and the industry which were required to frame hypotheses that were
worth testing, to guide the investigation by these hypotheses, to contrive, construct,

and adjust adequate apparatus, and to make with it the elaborate observations and
the exact observations and maps which were necessary. But when by these means
the new facts had been brought to light, the inference from them that there is
iron in the atmosphere of the sun was an easy one. This example will better
convey than a definition what are the characteristic features of an experimental

inquiry.

    On the other hand, no series of observations or experiments, however skilfully

arranged, could have enabled anyone to understand the cause of that familiar but
truly surprising phenomenon that a top stands upon its peg while it is spinning.

But a full explanation of it is within the reach of any student who will train his

mind to reason consecutively, and avail himself of the aids to prolonged con-

secutive thought which mathematicians have contrived. He will then see that the

most ohvious and familiar mechanical facts involve as necessary consequences all

the phenomena which he finds in the schoolboy's top, in the physicist's gyroscope,

and in the precession and nutation of the heavens. This then is a problem of Nature

which falls within the province of the deductive method.

     Wherever data are known exactly, there inferences from these data however
remote may be depended upon as corresponding with what actually occurs in Nature.
And if in such cases the mind of man has proved equal to the task of drawing

inferences which can effectually grapple with the problems he finds around him in

-- --the Universe which is, alas ! as yet but too seldom then will the deductive

method, our plummet, explore depths in the great ocean of existence which our

anchors of experiment could not have reached.

The distinction which is here made between deductive and experimental inves-

tigations would have no place in a logical system. But it has direct reference to
human convenience, and derives its importance from this circumstance. It is

obvious, too, that an investigation may partake of both characters--that it may

require all the powers of the scientific observer to get at the facts, or even to ap-

preciate them, and all the resources of the mathematician to elicit the consequences

of them. For instance, on beginning his electrical studies, the student of Nature

must master a mixed experimental and deductive inquiry to get at the elementary

fact that free electricity resides either at or outside the surfaces of conductors

and he must engage in a further inquiry, and one only within the reach of a trained

mind, to deduce from this the law of the inverse square. And, again, no full

appreciation or even intelligent use of the common electrostatic and electrodynamic

measures which he meets at the threshold of his electrical studies is within the

reach of the mere experimentalist or of the mere theorist. And if this treacherous

ground lies before the immature student at his entrance, what shall we say of the

Webogs he struggles into as he advances.                        are perpetually meeting with inquiries

of this mixed character in electricity and some of the other physical sciences, but

they are comparatively rare in either mechanics or chemistry, and none that is

Howdifficult lies in the path of the beginner.                                                          many students are there who are

made to slur over the above and a multitude of similar difficulties, and who are

told that they are learning science, when in fact what they are really learning is

the pernicious habit of being content to see Nature through a fog or through other

men's mental eyes.

In mechanics valuable progress can be made by the mere mathematician, the

student of deductive science ; and in chemistry similar progress can be made by the
mere experimentalist. Of all the physical sciences these are the most purely

deductive, and the most purely experimental. What I desire particularly to invite

attention to is that the two great methods of investigation may best be acquired in

these two sciences, and that for a really sound grasp of the remaining physical

sciences, and especially with a view to further advance in physical science, a com-
mand of both methods of investigation is essential. I ought to add, however, that

to confer this inestimable boon on the investigator of Nature, the great science of

mechanics must be studied by him in its own best form, and not degraded by the

vile expedient of evading the legitimate use of the infinitesimal calculus, to

comply, perhaps, with the ill-judged requirements of some examining body ; and

his practical chemistry must be the study of a science, and not a mere accumula-

tion of exercises in a lucrative art.

   We must bear in mind, too, that either method of investigation may be mis-

applied, and that this is a risk carefully to be guarded against. The deductive
method when misapplied lands us in speculation, the experimental method becomes

empiricism                                                      and it so happens that the sciences of  mechanics and chemistry are not
                                                             ;

pnly monuments of the power of the two great methods of investigation, but

instructive examples of their weakness also. For in chemistry, scarce any attempt

at prolonged reasoning, carrying us by any lengthened flight to a distance from

the experiments, can be relied on. The result has seldom risen to anything better

rfhan speculation. And on the other hand, in mechanics, conclusions which depend

on experiments only are empirical ; that is, they are deficient in accuracy, and
^their relation to the other phenomena of the science is left in darkness. Here, then,

we find in these two sciences not only how strong these two methods of investiga-

tion are, but how weak they may become if misapplied.                    _

I do not know whether any of my predecessors in this chair have experienced so

much difficulty, or have hesitated so long and so much as I have hesitated in select-
Mying the topic to which he would ask your attention.              first effort was an attempt

to delineate the great recent progress of the mathematical and physical sciences, but
it was unsatisfactory, partly from my own too scanty powers, and also because the
variety and even disparity of the numerous sciences somewhat arbitrarily grouped
A Mytogether in Section gave to the outline too sketchy a character.                                                                                           next

attempt was to make a selection among them, confining myself to those with which
I am best acquainted, and endeavouring to direct attention to the problems which
at the present time seem most to stand in need of solution. But here I felt
unwilling either to bring forward or to withhold views which might be disputed. I
then applied myself to the single consideration of what I hoped might prove useful and

not inopportune at a time when one university, which I trust will prove a great uni-
versity, is rising in the north of England, and when another university which has
carefully and successfully fostered a high standard of education for thirty years, and

which has thereby deserved and won the respect of educated men, has just been sacn-
ficedto ecclesiasticism in the sister isle. In this university I have held the most central
office for twenty-two years, and in the discharge of my duty had largely to influence

its destiny in respect to almost every educational problem. Parliament in its
wisdom has now seen fit to destroy this work, and I have not been without hope
that from the experience which has been gained some effect which shall last may
yet arise, and that the Queen's University may perhaps at its extinction bequeath a
useful legacy to the University of Victoria. The advancement of science in the
north of England will largely depend for many years on the wisdom of the regu-
                                                                   the new university                                                                          and
lations for scientific training which  are  adopted   at first by                                                                                           ;

I have therefore ventured, at this peculiar juncture, to submit to the judgment
of my scientific brethren the principles which much thought and many trials
extending over several years have led me to believe should guide them in selecting

this part of a curriculum.
mI have sought to show that it is in the study of mechanics and the practice
                                                                    #.

of chemistry that the two great methods of investigation may best be acquired. In
them they may be studied separately, by steps of graduated difficulty, and with a

superabundance of materials ; and each of them supplies the necessary cautions

with respect to the method which is all powerful in the other. No scientific man
is really equipped for the pursuits in which both methods have to be employed till

he has separately acquired a grasp of each. For it is only then that he will be
armed against the errors which lead so many to mistake empiricism on the one

hand and speculation on the other for solid science, or to underrate solid science
mistaking it for speculation. Nor is it only in his scientific occupationsthat he

will derive benefit from this training. All exact reasoning, whether in science or

in common life, belongs to these great divisions ; and in the numberless instances
in which we must be satisfied with reasoning which falls short of being exact, our
only safety lies in having by the practice of exact reasoning, both deductive and

experimental, attained to that intellectual tact and caution which alone will enable
us to handle with safety the sharp and slippery tool. It is thus that a sound
                                                                    man  or woman                                                                              and

soundness of judgment is the noblest endowment of man's understanding, just as

veracity stands first among his virtues.

      3. On Etherspheres as a Vera Causa of Natural Philosophy.
                          By Rev. S. Eaknshaw, M.A.

The author of this communication, assuming an admitted parallelism between the

phenomena of light and heat, proceeds by means of three hitherto overlooked

propositions in natural philosophy to establish the universal existence of what he

--has denominated etherspheres, the third of his propositions being ' Every atom of

matter in the universe is surrounded by an ethersphere of its own.' The follow-

ing is the system of nature which he finds sufficient for his purpose :

1. In nature there are two distinct substances, matter and ether, neither of

which has any power to attract or repel the other.

     2. Matter consists of atoms which attract each other with forces varying
according to the Newtonian law (distance) -3.

     3. The atoms of bodies of the same kind are alike in all respects ; atoms or

bodies of different kinds differ from each other in size, and possibly also in other

respects, such as shape, &c.

4. Atoms, whether of matter or of ether, are incapable of experiencing any

change of figure or dimensions ; and they are all assumed to be of such geometrical

forms as cannot fill space.

    5. From the phenomena of light it has been inferred that atoms of ether repel

each other with a force varying as (distance) -4.

     6. Every atom of matter is impervious to ether, and acts on ether in no other

way than by pressure of contact.

   A7. portion of space filled with matter is necessarily void of ether; and all

space void of matter is pervaded by ether.

8. The enormous velocity of light in free space has led to the opinion that

very great must be the repulsive power of ether on ether ; and it seems to follow
from this that an ether atom will experience great difficulty in moving from one

part of the ethereal medium to another. Except as waves and currents ether

motion will be under great restraints, and especially shall we see this when we

also  remember  the  high  power    4  of  its  inverse  law  of  force.
                                  ()

9. In free space light is believed to be transmitted with the same velocity in

every direction, and from this we infer that the atoms of ether are all spherical

in form.

The following is the author's definition of an ethersphere :--

All space not filled by matter is pervaded by ether, so that every atom of mat-

ter is surrounded by ether, but this is not what is included in the word ' ethersphere.'
The author shows that if any portion of space be rendered void of ether from any

cause whatever, that space has become void of the repulsive forces which were

centred within it, and that, consequently, when these forces are taken away the

medium outside the space will draw closer towards that space ; and if the space

be occupied by an atom of matter, the density of the surrounding ether will be-

greater than before, and the ether, being in contact with the atom at its surface,

will press upon it. This excess of ether about the vacant space above its original

quantity constitutes the ethersphere ; and though this gathering together of ether
--

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  249

about the space now occupied by the atom is a consequence of tbe presence of
the atom, it is in no way owing to its action on tbe etbereal medium.

     Tbe author then argues that if every material atom, so must every compound
system of atoms, i.e., every material body, whether gaseous, liquid, or solid, have
an ethersphere, which not only surrounds the whole body, but also penetrates the

interstitial spaces of the body which lie between its atoms.

    By means of these etherspheres the author believes the phenomena of heat
may be satisfactorily accounted for, on the supposition that the ethereal medium is

the medium of heat as well as of light. They are shown in the original memoir

itself to have a remarkable bearing also on the phenomena of magnetism, electricity,

galvanism, and the various sciences connected with the agency of imponderables.

He therefore concludes that etherspheres constitute a vera causa the existence of

which in nature is as certain as is that of the ethereal medium itself, about which

no philosopher expresses doubt in the present day.

4. On some New Instruments recently constructed for the continuation of
    researches on Specific Inductive Capacity. By J. E. H. Gordon, B.A.,

      Assistant Secretary of the British Association.

     Mr. Gordon exhibited and explained the following new instruments which he

has arranged during the last year :

   A(1) minature five-plate induction balance, similar in principle to the large-

balance exhibited at the Dublin meeting, but intended for the examination of crystals
and other precious substances which cannot be obtained in sufficiently large quan-

tities for the large balance.

     The large balance requires the dielectric plates to be 7 inches square and £ to
f inch thick. For the small balance it is sufficient to make them 2 inches square
and £ inch thick.

    A(2) gauge for measuring the thickness of the dielectric plates to 10 q 00 inch.
   A(3) new form of quadrant electrometer for use with the small induction

balance.

     The capacity of the smaller plates of the little induction balance is so minute
that when they are attached to the quadrants of the electrometer of ordinary con-
struction (Elliott pattern) disturbances in them produce hardly any effect on the
needle, on account of the much greater capacity of the quadrants of the electrometer.

     In order to construct an electrometer whose quadrants should have very small
capacity, and which should yet be very sensitive, the author has arranged the
quadrants as pieces of a flat disc, only one inch in diameter, and tbe needle has been
bent round them so as to be acted on by both their upper and lower surfaces and

their outside edge.

    A(4) new rapid commutator.

    This was invented by Professor Cornu, of the Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, who
had the great kindness to devise it for the author of this paper, who, when M.

Cornu took up the matter, had just constructed three different instruments for the
experiments for which this one is intended, all of which had proved unsuccessful.

     Some preliminary experiments with M. Oornu's instrument have shown that it

promises to be entirely satisfactory. It can be used with either the large or small
induction balance on the one hand, and with a Holtz machine or battery of 500 or
more cells on the other. It reverses the electrification of the plates of the balance
eighteen times per second, and between each reversal, short circuits, and puts

to earth both poles of the induction balance and both poles of the battery. By

altering two screws it can be arranged to short circuit and put to earth the poles
of the induction balance only, and to insulate the battery poles.

      (5) Driving-wheel for the Cornu commutator.
      All the instruments have been constructed by Mr. Kieser of the firm of

 Elliott Brothers.

5. On Secular Changes in the Specific Inductive Capacity of Glass. By

   J. E. H. Gordon, B.A., Assistant Secretary of the British Association.

    At Christmas 1877 I made some determinations of the specific inductive capacity

of optical glass by a method which has already been fully described both before
this section and elsewhere. 1

    At the end of July 1879 I commenced a repetition of the experiments, using

the same slabs of glass, and was surprised to find a large increase in the specific
inductive capacity in every case. In some cases the increase was as much as
twenty per cent.

     The following is a table of the results :

    My conclusion from the above numbers is, that although it is possible by

sufficiently wetting the surface of the plate to produce any apparent reduction of

the specific inductive capacity, yet that even if very much less care had been taken
to clean the plates than was taken in 1877, the greatest quantity of moisture that
could accidentally have been left on them would have been totally incapable of
producing anything bike the difference now under examination.

    I am therefore led to the conclusion that in the course of a year and a half an

actual change has taken place in the glasses, which is shown by a considerable real
increase in their specific inductive capacities. To complete our knowledge of this

new phenomenon we require a series of monthly observations, extended over

perhaps a period of several years. I shall hope to be able to give the results of
another year's experiments at the next meeting of the Association.

     These experiments have some importance as regards Professor Clerk Maxwell's
electro-magnetic theory of light. In a recent lecture 1 I ventured to suggest ' that
it is quite possible that the relation between electric induction and light exists
namely, that they are disturbances of the same ether, but that there is some un-
known disturbing cause affecting the electric induction.'

    Possibly a clue to the nature of this disturbing cause may be found in the fact,

that the specific inductive capacities are affected by some of the changes which
chemists tell us are constantly going on in glasses, but that these changes do not

affect the refractive indices.

        6. On the Cause of Bright Lines in the Spectra of Comets.
               By G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., F.B.S., H.B.I.A.

     Dr. Huggins and other observers have seen the bright lines of some compound
of carbon in the spectra of several comets. This establishes the fact that a com-
pound of carbon is present in the comets. It is always assumed in what has been

                                1 Royal Institution, February 6, 1879.
252 report-- 1879.

hitherto -written on this subject that the vapour which has thus been detected is

incandescent because it emits these bright lines.

     The author of the present communication wishes to put forward an alternative
hypothesis, which he believes to be entitled to much weight. It is that these lines
are due to the sun's light falling upon the compound of carbon, and rendering it visible
in the same way that light renders other opaque objects visible, the vapour being'
opaque in reference to the particular rays which appear as bright lines in its spectrum.

   An --opaque body is visible in the presence of a luminary from three causes

because of such a scattering of the incident light as takes place when a transparent
body is reduced to powder; because of the reflection of light from its surface if of
sufficient extent and sufficiently smooth ; and because of phosphorescence. Bequerel
has shown that phosphorescence contributes to render objects visible in a vast
number of instances, and it is this which seems to produce the effect in the case
now under consideration.

     Phosphorescence consists in the exaltation of such molecular motions by radiant
heat as are unable readily to communicate their superfluous energy to the other
kinds of motion which are going on in or among the molecules. The motions-
within the molecules of gases stand in this predicament if the intervals between

the encounters of the molecules are sufficiently long. Now in comets, on account

of their small mass, the vapour must be excessively attenuated, and these intervals
must be proportionately long. Hence the conditions are such as will eminently
promote phosphorescence, and therefore visibility, in the presence of a luminary.

7. Sur le Maximum d'Intensite du Spectre Photographique Solaire. Par

        le Dr. J. Janssen, de Vlnstltut de France, Directeur de V Ohservatoire-
       de Meudon.

     Gette communication est la suite des recherches sur ce sujet, et qui remontent a
1874. Des cette epoque j'avais reconnu que le spectre solaire presentait un

maximum d'intensite situe au dela de F vers le violet.

     Depuis a diverses reprises j'ai communique le r^sultat de ces recherches, qui ont
6te frequemment interrompues. (Voir les notices de ' L'Annuaire du Bureau des
Longitudes,' 1878, 1879, et le ' Report of British Association,' 1878.)

      Les parties nouvelles de ce travail concernent l'examen des diverses substances
photographiques et des divers milieux optiques, et surtout l'emploi d'une nouvelle
methode d'6tude du spectre par la variation du temps de pose et que je propose de

nommer analyse chronometrique du spectre.

   --Methode d'Analyse CJironometrique du Spectre. Cette methode consiste a faire

passer devant la fente d'un appareil a photographier le spectre, et pendant la pose un
Icran en forme de triangle, qui, par le progres de son mouvement, vient masquer
successivement les diverses parties du spectre dans le sens de sa hauteur ; en sorte
que si l'on considere deux lignes ou bandes brillantes du spectre ces lignes prendront
dans la photographie des longueurs en rapport avec leurs intensites lumineuses.

     En effet si l'on considere le spectre dans un sens perpendiculaire a celui de ses

lignes spectrales ou de la fente, on reconnaitra que les points dans cette direction
recoivent une pose egale, que cette pose est au contraire de plus en plus grande a.
mesure qu'on marche dans le sens perpendiculaire dans la direction des raies et
vers les parties que l'ecran triangulaire couvrira les dernieres.

     Le mouvement de l'ecran triangidaire est donne par un rouage d'horlogerie et

doit pouvoir prendre des vitesses variables.
      L'ecran triangulaire rectiligne peut etre remplace" par im triangle dont l'hypo-

thenuse est une courbe de forme dtSterminee pour produire une pose variant suivant
une loi determine^. 1

      1 Cette methode permet de mettre en evidence et de mesurer les intensity
 photographiques des divers points des spectres par la consideration des longueurs
 des lignes ou bandes dans leurs images photographiques. Elle pourra etre
 specialement employe a la question de la presence des lignes brillantes de l'oxygene
 dans le spectre solaire.

maximum sont les suivantes :

On a employe" des spectrographes forme's avec prismes et lentilles de quartz, de

bromures de potassium, sodium, ammonium, zinc, cadmium. Ces substances ont

6t6 essayt5es soit isolt5ment soit associges.

Pour la pose : on s'est procure" relativement a cbaque disposition d'experience

une st5rie de spectres depuis cinq minutes de pose jusqu'a une fraction de seconde.

    On a aussi employe la ine"thode des e"crans a, marches et la niethode chronomgtrique

decrite plus haut.

  --Resultats. Ces etudes ont conduit a reconnaitre qu'il existe un maximum

d'action dans le spectre solaire.

bromures lui donnent plus d'etendue que les iodures.

traduit par une e"troite bande pres de G.

10. Some Observations on Generic Images. By W. Cave Thomas, F.S.S.

    At the first Art Congress held in Antwerp many years since, in propounding
the theory, that the average or mean form, was, according to probability and expe-
rience, the fittest form of the species, and in man the form of beauty, I attempted

to demonstrate the truth of the theory by experiment, though with very imperfect

appliances. I again alluded to the matter in one of my earliest published works,
' The Science of Moderation,' and expressed my conviction that the demonstration

would be more completely effected at some future time, as appears to have been
done by Mr. Francis Galton in his ' Composite Photography.'

     The rationale of such experiments is simply this, that we perform a mechanical
averaging. Instead of any one object being presented to our graze, we have a mean

image, in which proportions of excess and defect have mutually neutralised each
other. It is true that in photography the process is very limited ; it can deal but

with a few individuals, but on that sensitive surface, the retina, a vast range of

individual images of the same species may be impressed, but as excesses and defects

neutralise each other, the mean or average image is most forcibly impressed on the

Wemind, and that image constitutes our ideal.  arrive at the idea of beauty in

precisely the same way that we arrive by a series of observations at the true place

of a star. But it is not necessary, in order to illustrate the mental process by a

W«mechanical process, that we should photograph human beings.      may take

geometrical forms, such for instance, as the genus ellipse, whose transverse and

conjugate axes may vary between the limits of 1 : 1 and 1 : 0. The diameters of

the mean ellipse, parallelogram rhombus, and oviform are as 1 : 2, a proportion in

these figures which has been a favourite one through the ages. The genus ellipse

may be divided into species, any one of which may be experimented with, for

instance the species lying within the limits of 1 : 1^ to 1 : H, or of 1 : 1£ to 1 : 2, &c.
I propose to photograph the impression which such figures would make through

an aperture in a revolving disc.

4. On the Retardation of Phase of Vibrations transmitted by the Telephone.
                By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

It was predicted from theoretical considerations by Dubois-Raymond that a dif-

ference of phase, amounting to a quarter of a complete vibration, would be found

to exist between the diaphragms of two associated Bell telephones, the receiving

Atelephone being a quarter of a vibration behind the transmitter.  more complete

theory, worked out independently by Helmholtz and Weber, gave a somewhat

contradictory result, and required only a small difference of phase. Recently Konig,

in a series of delicate experiments, effected an optical comparison by the method of

Lissajons of the vibrations of a pair of telephones, replacing the vibrating discs by

tuning-forks armed with mirrors. The experiment is a delicate one, and is per-

formed under conditions not free from objection. The author has proposed the
Afollowing method of observing.
                                  pair of Bell telephones are suspended by wires

of about a metre in length, so as to oscillate as pendulums, to frames so disposed

as to avoid the possibility of any mechanical transmission of the vibrations. Below

the point of rest of each telephone, and at some little distance from it in the plane

of its swinging, is placed a steel magnet. After the lengths of the wires have been

so adjusted that the telephones will swing in identical periods, one telephone is set

swinging. As it alternately approaches and recedes from the magnet, the induced
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  255

currents traversing the second telephone set it swinging. In every case the differ-
ence of phase observed amounted to one quarter.

     In the case of those telephones which transmit vibrations by varying the resist-
ance of the circuit, instead of varying the electromotive force, there is no such
retardation of phase produced in the ordinary electromagnetic receiver. If, how-
ever, the current so transmitted is first passed through an induction coil, a re-
tardation of phase of one quarter is produced, and in the case of several successive
inductions the retardation amounts to an additional quarter for every additional
induction. This remark applies only to vibrations of harmonic and quasi-harmonic
type. Vowel sounds, which consist of compound harmonic vibrations, are un-
changed to the perception of the single ear, which is unable to distinguish differ-
ences of phase, or between compound sounds which differ from one another only
in the difference of phase of their components. The vibrations of consonantal
sounds, on the contrary, depart more and more widely from their original type at

each successive induction.
      In the case of Edison's niotographic or electro-chemical receiver, the velocities,

not the displacement of the disc, are proportional to the strength of the currents

received. Hence vibrations already retarded one quarter in transmission, as is the
case with those of the carbon transmitter in conjunction with its induction coil,
always used with this instrument, are restored to their primitive phase. The
vibrations of this receiver therefore agree in type, not with the vibrations of the
induction current (which correspond to the derived function of those of the original
vibration), but with those corresponding to the function of which the vibrations

of the induction current are the derivate ; that is to say, they agree in type with
the primitive vibrations of whatever form. Hence in the receiving telephone of
Edison consonantal sounds which depart widely from the purely harmonic type
are better rendered than in a telephone which like that of Bell both retards the
vibrations in phase and alters them in type.

 5. The Pseudophone. By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

     The pseudophone is an instrument whose object is to illustrate the laws of the
acoustic perception of space by the illusions it produces, just as the pseudoscope
of Wheatstone illustrates the laws of the optical perception of space by the ocular

illusions it produces.

     The pseudophone consists of certain adjustable reflectors which can be at-
tached to the head, and which perform the functions of the natural pinnae in
ordinary hearing. According to Steinhauser's theory of Binaural Hearing, the
acoustic perception of space depends upon the relative intensity with which a
sound-wave is received into the two ears, this again depending on the conforma-
tion and position of the head. Though in general true for many sounds, this
theory fails to account for certain observed facts in the perception of sound, and
fails in so far as it neglects differences of phase and of pitch.

     Experiments made with the pseudophone indicate the direction in which Stein-

hauser's theory requires modification.

     6. On the Tension of Vapours near Curved Surfaces of their Liquids.
                                   By G. F. Fitzgerald.

     The paper is intended to give a physical explanation of the fact that the tension
of a vapour in contact with the surface of its liquid when that surface is convex or
concave is greater or less respectively than when flat. It rests upon the assumption
that evaporation is not merely superficial, but that molecules are emitted from a

certain depth beneath the surface of a liquid. From this it follows that the

chances of escape of a molecule from a given depth below a convex surface are
greater, and from below a concave one less, than from a flat one. Taking the depth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               :

from which emission takes place as very small compared with the radii of curvature
of the surface, I have deduced the same formula for the increase or diminution of

tension as Sir W. Thomson deduced from capillary phenomena.

7. On the Curve of Polarisation Stress, as determined by Mr. Crookes's
      Measures with the Radiometer. By G. Johnstone Stonet, M.A.,

       F.B.S., M.B.I.A.

      Mr. Orookes has published in hisBakerian lecture (' Philosophical Transactions,'

1878, pp. 300 and 301) a table and curve representing v, the number of revolutions
per minute of a radiometer at different tensions of the residual gas when influenced

by a candle three inches off. And at pp. 313 to 316 he gives similar values and the
curve for p, the coefficient of viscosity of the residual gas at low tensions. From
these observations we may obtain information with regard to the polarisation stress

which caused the motion.
     The observations of v were made when the radiometer had attained a constant

velocity, from which it follows that the retarding forces then balanced the impelling

force, and were therefore a measure of it. Now the retarding forces were three

the friction on the peg, an approximately constant force which may be represented
by a ; the resistance from viscosity, which may be represented by bfiv (b being

another constant), and the force required to drive the residual air out of the path of

the advancing vanes, which may be represented approximately by cVv2, c being
another constant and P the tension. Hence the polarisation stress

         =                        a  +  bfiv  +  cPy2
                                                              ,

the second and third terms of which can be deduced from Mr. Crookes's curves, and

separately plotted down, fiv will then furnish a curve resembling Mr. Crookes's

curve of velocity in its general shape, but with its maximum at a higher tension.

Pd2 gives a somewhat similar curve, also with a maximum at a higher tension than

Mr. Crookes's curve. The friction of the peg will obviously furnish a horizontal

Weline.  do not know the coefficients a, b, and e, but can perceive that the curve

representing the impelling force, i.e., the polarisation stress (whose ordinates will be

the sum of the ordinates of the foregoing curves, multiplied respectively by the coeffi-

cients a, b, c), must have a form somewhat resembling Mr. Crookes's velocity curve,

the chief difference to be noted being that the maximum stress occurs at a higher

tension than the maximum velocity.

The form of the curve thus deduced from the observations is in harmony with

the approximate curve which results from the theory of polarisation stress put

forward by the author of the present communication (see ' Scientific Transactions of

Newthe Royal Society of Dublin,'    Series, vol. i. ; or ' Philosophical Magazine,' for

December, 1878). It is also consistent with the complete expansions for the polari-

sation stress given in the next communication.

Pwhich the temperature decreases across the layer, T and standard temperature

and pressure, e,, the mean free path of the molecules at standard temperature and

Mpressure, cr the specific gravity of the gas compared with a standard gas (say

hydrogen), and a standard mass (say one gramme).

     The method by which the foregoing expansions were obtained is believed to be

G Knew. The expressions for and must be compatible with any change in the

gas which is consistent with its continuing a ' perfect ' gas. Accordingly a succes-
sion of such changes was conceived as happening, and the forms under which
P, o-, T, e, must enter were thereby successively determined, the final determina-
tion being made by the condition of homogeneity.

     The first term of expansion (1) is the approximate expression which Clausius
found for the flow of heat ; and the first term of expansion (3) is the approximate
expression which the author of the present communication found for the polarisa-

tion stress. Acccordingly the approximate expressions which had before been
known prove to be the first terms of the complete expansions.

            9. On the Action of Magnets on Liquid Jets.
       By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

     In studying the phenomena of the voltaic arc, the author has been led to inquire

into the actions produced by magnets upon movable conductors, such as jointed

wires, flexible metallic leaves, liquid conductors, gases in high rarefaction, flames,
and liquid jets, traversed by currents.

     Nearly all the phenomena of rotations and translations due to electrodynamic
and electromagnetic attraction or repulsion have been demonstrated to hold good

for liquid conductors, both those which possess metallic conductivity and those
which possess only electrolytic conductivity. Davy, Oasselmann, and Walker have

shown the electric arc to behave as a mobile conductor. Pliicker and De la Pave,

and more recently Grookes, have observed the existence of these electro-dynamic

actions on the luminous discharges in highly rarefied media, and which appear to
be electric convection currents rather than electric currents proper.

     The author has examined the case of liquid veins, both of dilute acid and of
mercury traversed by currents, and finds that these, when subjected to the action of
powerful magnets, exhibit analogous motions of translation, rotation, &c. Thus a
liquid vein carrying a current between the poles of a horizontal horseshoe electro-

Amagnet no lunger falls straight but is thrust aside and falls down an inverted curve.

    vein falling in front of the pole of a vertical magnet is likewise drawn aside,

tending to become parallel to the hypothetical Amperian currents, and to rotate in
an opposed sense around the pole. Further, a liquid vein carrying a current falling
upon the pointed pole of a vertical magnet is twisted, the sense of the torsion depend-
ing on the direction of the current and the polarity of the magnet. The author has
also essayed to extend his observations to the case of liquid jets which break in the
air, and which, therefore, cannot carry electric currents proper, but only electric
convection currents, and the results obtained, though not yet completed, dispose
him to include in this set of phenomena the so-called diamagnetism of flames and
of jets of smoke and steam.

                                By W. Ladd, F.R.A.S.

    My object in this communication is to describe in a few words the peculiarities

and improvements in the construction of Weston's dynamo-electric machine.
     The field magnets are composed of iron plates placed side by side in a mould,

but separated a uniform distance from each other. The iron magnets on which
the wire is to be wound are cast on to ·' lugs' or projections on the ends of the
plates. The two cast-iron ends and uniting plates form one magnet. The upper
and lower magnets are alike, and when joined together by the perforated vertical
supports, the inner curved edges of the field plates embrace about two-thirds of
the circle in which the armature is made to revolve. The armature is built up
of plates which are somewhat like a cogged-wheel in shape. These are stamped
out of sheet iron, and when mounted on the shaft are separated from each other at a
uniform distance. The radial projections are then arranged in lines, so that the
whole forms a very broad cogged-wheel or cylindrical structure, having longitudinal
grooves with transverse spaces at regular distances. The longitudinal grooves are
for carrying the wire, and it will be observed from the nature of the structure that
the wire lies in channels three sides of which are iron, so that the mutual effect
upon each other is increased as much as possible.

     The ends of the wires are connected to the field magnets and commutator in
much the usual way, the currents travelling in one direction only. The commu-
tator is fitted on a portion of the shaft which projects beyond the bearings ; this
admits of its easy removal and a new one being replaced in three minutes.

      Another important feature in the construction is the arrangement for ventila-
tion. The separation between the pole plates of the field magnets, the perforations
in the vertical supports of the magnets, and the light framework of the armature,
are all for this purpose. The air enters the centre of the armature and is driven
out between the layers of wire through the spaces formed by the separated plates
of the armature and the field magnets, and thus prevents any part from becoming
unduly heated.

     Machines of this description are made of various sizes and strengths, and give
from one to sixteen lights in single circuit.

             13. On Lightning Protectors for Telegraphic Apparatus.
         By William Henry Preece, Electrician, General Post-Office.

    For many years it was not the practice in England to protect telegraphic
apparatus from the injurious effects of atmospheric electricity, because the damage
done was so insignificant, and because the remedy was found to be worse than the

disease.

     But as telegraph systems increased, as the country became enveloped in one vast
network of wires, it was found that the damage done became considerable, until, in
fact, about 10 per cent, of the apparatus in use was in one year damaged.

    Lightning protectors then became essential. Many forms were tried, based on
the fact that when a discharge takes place through a non-conductor, such as dry
air, at the moment of discharge the resistance along the line of discharge is

practically nothing, and therefore all the charge is conducted away. According to

Faraday, ' the ultimate effect is exactly as if a metallic wire had been put into the
place of the discharging particles' {Researches, Series xii., 1406). Most of those

tried failed.

 lm-- ^ --The survival of the fittest has been exemplified in the ' plate' protector. In this

 ? one °f e eai'liest introduced one thick plate of brass is in connection with
the earth, and another similar plate in connection with the line is placed above it,
but separated from it by paper, or by insulating washers. The lightning, entering

                                                      s2
·260 report-- 1879.

the wire, bursts across the paper or air space in preference to passing through the
apparatus, and thus escapes to earth.

    An important modification of this plate-discharger has been made by Dr. Werner

Siemens, who, by serrating or grooving with a pointed tool the opposing faces of
the two plates at right angles to each other, converted them into a conductor, which
was supposed to be one composed of an infinite number of opposing points. The
remarkable action of points in facilitating discharge is well known, and their intro-

duction into lightning protectors occurred very early in the annals of telegraphy,

by Mr. 0. V. Walker, F.R.S.

      Messrs. Siemens' arrangement, very pretty in theory, never carried conviction of

its value in the mind of the author, because protectors so prepared never singled
themselves out as evidently superior to others that were not so prepared ; and while
the intersection of the grooves certainly formed mathematical points, they did not
form physical or mechanical points, and it is upon the action of this latter kind of

point that such remarkable electrical effects are produced.

     Dr. Warren De La Rue having very kindly placed his well-known battery of

11,000 cells at the disposal of the writer, he prepared four plate protectors, identical

in dimensions, excepting that two were serrated and two were not. The two plates
were separated from each other by narrow ebonite washers, -01 inch thick. The
upper plate was placed in connection with the positive pole, and the lower plate
with the negative pole. The number of cells was increased until a continuous

current of electricity flowed.

                                                1. Plain Plates.

No. of Cells.  Effect Produced.

1,000 . . Sparks just commencing on making contact.

1,080 . . Sparks evident.
1,200 . . Sparks frequent.
1,500 . . Continuous arc, but fitful.

     2,000 cells in each produced a continuous stream of electricity. The effect with
1,500 cells was decidedly more marked with the plain plates than with those
serrated. The experiments were extremely pretty, and very decided in their

character.

     Hence it appears that grooving is not only of no use, but that it rather deteri-

orates the value of the protector.
     These experiments confirm very decidedly the accuracy of the figures obtained

by Dr. Warren De La Rue and Mr. Miiller on the striking distance between two flat
discs given by them in their paper read before the Royal Society {Phil. Tram., vol.
169, 1877), where it was shown that 1,200 cells struck across -012 inch. Here 1,000
cells struck across - 01 inch, which agrees perfectly with the curve produced by

those observers.
     It is the practice in the Post-Office Telegraph Department to keep these plates

apart by thin paraffined paper, - 002 inch thick, so that the air-space is really much

thinner than that experimented upon, and the striking difference of potential only
250 volts.

    Messrs. De La Rue and Miiller have shown that for points and various kinds of

surfaces opposed to each other plain surfaces act the best for potentials less than

1,500 volts, and that points are only efficient for high potentials. Now, as it is
doubtful whether atmospheric electricity causes much higher potential in telegraph
wires than 1,000 volts, it is clear that plain surfaces are the most effective for

                       By A. J. C. Allen, B.A., Scholar of Peterhouse.

    The principal object of this paper is to solve the problem of the conduction of

electricity in a spherical current sheet, the electricity being introduced and carried

off from the sheet at any number of points, called electrodes ; and also to do the

same for certain finite portions of a spherical sheet, bounded either by current or

equipotential lines, the motion being in all cases steady.

    The method of doing this is summed up in the following theories :
    Let =v ·>// (?·' 8') be the potential at any point (>·' 6') of a plane conducting

sheet of any conducting isotropic material and any infinitely small thickness, the

sheet being bounded by the curve

or equipotential line, according to the nature of that in the plane.

     This theorem is then applied to deducing solutions for a number of finite
areas on the sphere. The case of one source and an equal sink on a complete sphere
is discussed in detail, and the current and equipotential lines shown to be two sys-
tems of small circles.

    A similar theorem, though not quite so universal in its application, is shown

to hold for a sheet in the shape of a circular cylinder.

     The paper concludes with a solution in singly infinite series of the problem of the
conduction of electricity in a plane area, bounded by two concentric circles, and also
in that bounded by two concentric circles and two radii, meeting at an angle

^(n integer).

4. On tlie Fundamental Principles of the Algebra of Logic.
     By Alexander Macfarlane, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

     In a work recently published, entitled ' The Algebra of Logic,' I have investigated
anew the foundations of that branch of mathematical analysis which was originated
by Boole in hi3 celebrated treatise on ' The Laws of Thought.' In making this
inquiry I have studied the contributions to the subject made by Harley, Venn,
Jevons, and other philosophers.

     The difficulty and apparent irrationality of Boole's calculus is due to the fact
that it is founded on the old and inadequate theory of the operation of the mind in
reasoning about quality. That theory supposes that the mind, in forming a com-
pound conception out of two simple conceptions, necessarily considers the second of
these as limited by, and in a measure dependent upon, the first ; in the theory
which I advance it is maintained that the mind may, on the one hand, form com-
pound conceptions in which the second element is entirely dependent on the first
and, on the other hand, compound conceptions, in which the two elements are

mutually independent.

      I consider that the fundamental notion in this branch of analysis is that of a
collection of homogeneous objects having differentiating characters. The collection

of objects, so far forth as they are homogeneous, may be denoted by u (as they form

the universe considered in the particular investigation) ; a differentiating character

may be denoted by a small letter, as x. The symbol x applies to, and is entirely
dependent upon, u. The arithmetical value of u is the number of the objects
considered, and may be singular, plural, or infinitely great. The arithmetical
value of x is the ratio of the number of the objects which have the character x to
the whole number of objects considered.

     By x = y it is asserted that those of the objects which have the character x are

identical with those which have the character y. Hence the members of a logical

equation are also equal arithmetically, and have the same sign. When the cha-

racters equated are identical, the equation is an identity; when they are merely

 equivalent, the equation is one of condition.

      The symbol + 1 denotes that mental operation which, when applied to ux,
 takes them once and arranges them in the positive direction along the line in which

 the mind moves in counting ; and --1 arranges them along the negative direction.

These operations are connected by the relations +1-1=0. The symbols (--1)2

and ( -- 1)5 --that is, ( )r, and --( )2, when applied to ux, arrange them along

another and independent line of counting in the positive and negative directions

respectively.

    In x + y the two parts are perfectly independent, and therefore are not neces-

sarily mutually exclusive. In the expression x -- y, the two parts destroy one
--another as far as possible in virtue of the relation + 1 1 = ; the result in general

consists of a positive part and a negative part.

    Thus a qualitative expression x is in general both positive and negative. When

          _

it is positive and not negative, it satisfies the condition x% = x ; when negative and

=--x;not positive, it satisfies the condition x2  and when neither positive nor

negative, it satisfies the two conditions x* = x and x*= --x.
     uxy properly denotes those of the objects which have the character x and

which have the character y. The expression xy is a function of x and y, in which
these symbols are co-ordinately dependent on u. According to Boole, x applies to
u, and y applies to ux. But y applied to ux has in general a different meaning and

a different arithmetical value from y applied to u ; hence it is necessary to denote
the change of subject by a mark, as x.y. This distinction appears in the

theory of probability, in the contrast between two events which are independent of

one another, and two events which are dependent one on the other.

                                                                                                    x

The function xy has a single meaning and arithmetical value. The function -

on the contrary, has a manifold meaning and arithmetical value. It means any
           --

                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                       263

expression which, when multiplied by y, is equivalent to x. The nianifoldness
of the arithmetical value of x- follows from the circumstance that in zy - x the y is

co-ordinate with, not subordinate to the s.

mThe expression xm denotes the selective operation resulting from         of the x

operations being applied together ; and similarly x*r> denotes that selective opera-

mtion which is such that when          of it are taken simultaneously the result is

identical with x.

    The rule of signs follows from the relation connecting + and -- , viz.,
+ 1 -- 1=0; taken together with the restriction of + to denote no change of

direction by defining + 2 = + .

     Since an expression is in general both positive and negative, an equation in

general involves two component equations, the one of which refers to the positive

part and the other to the negative part. Hence an inequation requires in general

£x--ytwo signs. Thus a -- by         --asserts that the positive part of a b includes the

positive part of x -- y, and that the negative part of a -- b is included in the negative
part of x -- y. The ordinary axioms concerning the transformation of equations

and inequations still hold true.
     It follows from these principles that there is an Algebra of Quality which

absorbs the ordinary theories of necessity and probability, and that this Algebra is

a generalised form of the ordinary Algebra. Hence all the theorems about
quantity are, after being properly generalised, true of quality also ; and conversely,
all the novel theorems about quality are, after beiDg restricted by a particular

condition, true of quantity.

                           By W. H. L. Russell, F.B.S.

    The object of this paper was to ascertain the possibility of a certain experiment
for ascertaining the repulsion of two voltaic wires influenced by currents moving
in them in opposite directions.

                      7. On Plane Class-Cubics with three Single Foci.

already published, in which one or more foci are at an infinite distance, or two or
three foci unite to form a multiple focus. 1

     2. The locus of the satellite- point, when there are inflexional cubics in a family
of confocal groups, is material to the classification : it is obtained by eliminating

the parameter from the quartic and sextic invariants of the cubic equation to a
group. According to the position of the satellite-point on or within the several

convolutions of this locus, a confocal group may contain an odd or even number

of critical values ; if the satellite is on the locus, there is one inflexional cubic,

and there may be three or one other critical values ; and if it do not lie on the

locus, there is an even number, four, two, or none. If a focus be at infinity, there

is one additional critical cubic. If the satellite He on a side of ABO, there is a loss

of a critical value. There are at the most six critical values.

     The eliminant of k is the locus of the satellite-point. This would not be useful

to calculate ; but the asymptotes, the intersections by the sides of ABO, and by

ABOparallels to those sides, and intersections by the circle circumscribed about

(2a/3y = o) can be obtained in serviceable forms, as well as the form of the curve at
the vertices of ABO.

examine its properties apart. Thus the Hessian of this family is the same complex,

wherever the satellite is placed, viz., the centre of ABO, and the line at infinity.

The species of equiharmonic is thus determined : for the Hessian of the other

species consists of three real points.

     Its Oayleyan is also independent of the satellite, and determines the line at

infinity and a point-conic at the centre. The evectant of T is also an equiharmonic
cubic of the other species, so that the series of equiharmonics may be multiplied

indefinitely.

The whole series of non-singular forms may be exhibited at once by line co-

ordinates. For order-cubics diagrams are most conveniently drawn by the

equivalent equation referred to the cusps (or inflexional points, dually viewed), and

the points in which the tangents at the cusps concur

                                   (P + Q + R) 3 + 6kPQR = o.

     The dual order-cubics are the two redundant hyperbolae, with three diameters,
simplex trilateral (Newton's Fig. 33) and simplex quadrilateral (Fig. 34). The
equiharmonic form, in which the stationary tangents or asymptotes concur', is drawn
(Fig. 42). The complex or bipartite form, in which an oval is enclosed by the
asymptotic triangle is not considered by Newton, but by his commentator, Stirling.

     In one case the form of conversion fails, when

k=-|, (P + Q + R) 3 -27 PQR = o, orP* + Q* + R*=o.

ABCThis represents part of the bounding curve when                                                                                           is equilateral (supra, § 7).

But it is not represented in the canonical form, by the value 1= --h, except that

the line at infinity is common to both forms. Fspecial interest attaches itself to

this fault, since in piano there is thus occasioned a loss of one critical value, as

compared with spherics, which loss first occurring when the satellite is at the

centre of ABC, and therefore when it is within the bounding curve (P* + Q^ + R*),

continues throughout the various positions of the satellite.

It may be noticed that the two harmonic curves of this group are conjugate,

i.e., each is the Hessian of the other. Hence it becomes apparent why the in-
variant (T = o) expresses the condition that the second Hessian shall be the original

curve. This relation holds good also when the parameters are imaginary.

   H9. three foci of a class-cubic be in any finite position, the envelope of the

stationary tangents of the inflexional cubics in a family of such confocal groups is

a class-quartic.

If such a group be denoted

                         U= -- --= f-i                 --       +\pr + ruq* + vr = o,

                      apP + bqQ, + crR = 2 (aY - ^cqr cos A) = 4A2 .

One condition for a point of inflexion is

                                    d»U ffU _/ri»Uy»
                                  dp* ' dq*~\dpdq) ~ '

This determines the envelope :

           (ap + bq + cr) ( -- ap + bq + cr) (ap -- bq + cr) (ap + bq -- cr)

                A B= 8abc pqr (ap cos + bq cos + cr cos C).

Lines which join the centres of the inscribed and escribed circles with the foci and
the centre of the circumscribed circle, touch the envelope.

     This is the analogue of Pliicker's theorem : the locus of the cusps in a family of

groups of redundant hyperbolae is the maximum ellipse, which can be inscribed in

the triangle formed by the asymptotes.
     If the triangle formed by the foci is equilateral, the class-quartic degenerates

each family of groups.

                   8. On a Modification of the Law of Facility.
                        By Donald M'Alister, B.A., B.Sc. .,

Suppose we prepare a series of tints of grey, composed of varying proportions of

black and white, and arrange them in regular gradation of depth so that to the

eye the successive terms of the series differ by equal amounts. Then experiment

and observation, summed up            in  the  Law  of Fechner, show                           us  that  the  series of
                                                                                                                                            _

numbers which express the percentages of black (or of white) in the successive

tints form a geometrical series. If now a person tried to match a grey tint which

he had seen, he would be liable to error. By the ordinary principle, in any large

number of such fallible matches, we deem equal departures from the truth to be

equally probable, and take the mean of all the estimates as the best value of the

true tint which we can derive from them. But the previous considerations show us

that the ' mean ' must be not the arithmetic mean, but the geometric mean. For ex-

ample, tints containing 4, 8, 16, parts of black will seem equally graded. It is as

likely, therefore, that, the true tint being 8, an estimate ;16 shall be made as an

Weestimate 4.      should make a mistake if, having only these two estimates before

us, we inferred that the AM. or 10 was most probably the truth, and not the

GM. or 8.

This particular example is the type of a large number of cases connected with

fallible estimates, and of many statistical series where there is reason to believe that

a ' geometric mean ' gives a truer average or representative than the ordinary arith-
metic mean. It becomes of importance to inquire what modification must be made

in the Law of Facility. This law purports to represent the distribution of aberrant

measures round the mean. And it is well known that the assumption that the

^AM. is the most probable value leads to the expression of the Theory of Errors,
=viz., y   e -fc2  3    x  being  the     measure and  a  the  mean.                           What law follows from
                     ,

the assumption that the GM. is the most probable mean ? This is the gist of the

reasoning and the problem which Mr. Francis Galton laid before me some time

since. I propose here merely to state my answer, leaving the proofs and the

development of the theory to another occasion.

    If x (as before) be the measure, a the geometric mean, the (infinitesimal) pro-

bability that x is the estimate made is proportional to

                                                                                            2

                                          exp(-^(log£)
                                                                                ),

where ' exp ' is brief for ' e to the power of?
     If the question be modified, as suggested by the ordinary theory, and it be asked

'What is the probability of an estimate lying between the close limits x and

x + dx ? ' The answer is

                                      _hexp(-IA-(isl/Iog   3\ 2\&c

                                                          Ca ))-.

     In both cases h is a constant depending on the general closeness of the measures

which, as in the ordinary theory, we may call the 'measure of precision' or

' weight?

     The matter has statistical and physiological bearings of great interest, and I

believe of some practical value.

9. Note on the Enumerations of Privies of the Forms 4m + 1 and 4m + 3.

                        By J. W. L. Glaisher, M.A., F.B.8.

    At the last meeting of the British Association I communicated the results of an
enumeration, then just completed, of the primes of the form 4m + 1 and of the

form 4m + 3 in three groups, each of 100,000 numhers, viz., between and 100,000,
between 1,000,000 and 1,100,000, and between 2,000,000 and 2,100,000. These
results are printed on page 471 of the ' Keport ' for 1878. It is there stated that
' the numbers given in the table are the result of a duplicate enumeration ; but a
third enumeration will be required, in order to render it certain that they are

absolutely free from error.' This third enumeration has now been made, and the
following two errors in the table were detected by means of it : in the first ten
thousand of the second million the numbers of 4m + 1 and 4m + 3 primes should be

respectively 390 and 363, instead of 391 and 362 as printed, and in the third ten
thousand of the third million the numbers should be 350 and 343 instead of 349
and 344 as printed. The totals of the columns thus become 3,642 and 3,574 in
the second million, and 3,463 and 3,411 in the third million.

     Since the meeting at Dublin the enumerations have also been made for the first
hundred thousand numbers of the fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth millions. In
the case of the fourth million the enumerations were made from the proof sheets

myof father's factor table for this million, which is now stereotyped and ready for

publication.

     The total numbers for primes of the forms 4m 1-i- and 4n + 3 in the first one
hundred thousand numbers of each of the seven millions are
                                                                                        --

above is different in character to an enumeration extending from zero to a given
high number, but Professor Tchebycheff's result gives a special interest to sepa-
rate enumerations of 4w + 1 and 4n + 3 primes.

   12. Note on a Method of checking Calculations. By W. H. Walenn. 3

     The object of this note is to draw attention to the advantages of checking cal-
culations by casting out the elevens in preference to casting out the nine's.

    By this means, in many cases, the calculation can be checked by an appeal to

the question and answer only. Also decimal calculations can be checked in

consequence of the remainders used being imitates, that is, simply the number of

units by which the number to be dealt with is in excess of being exactly divisible

by the divisor. This divisor may, in practice, be either 9 or 11.

As an instance, suppose the wcalculation to be checked is = 62 -32, 2'375, 3*25,

U U3 - 75 = 1803-871875. In casting out the nines the symbolisation is

the number operated upon, neither is there a check upon the place of any particular

digit, nor upon the figures themselves, if they be either 9 or 0, or if their sum be

9 or any multiple of 9. In 100 there are 33 fractional imitates to reciprocals.

In casting out the elevens there is a check upon the number of digits, upon the

Additions can be dealt with at one operation. Subtractions must have the

unitate of the minuend made greater than that of the subtrahend. Decimal

multiplications must be without contraction ; but divisions may be finished at any

predetermined place of decimals, taking into account the remainder. Fractions

are treated as if of the form a.-^.

very serviceable for checking tables and formulae in which the higher powers occur.

          4. On the Direct Motion of Periodic Comets of Short Period.
                               By Professor H. A. Newton.

     In the ' American Journal of Science ' I published a few months since an article
on the origin of comets. I undertook in that article to find out if there is in any

facts we know about the comets reason to say whether they must have come to us

from outside space, or whether they have been formed out of matter that lay on
the outer edge of the disc-shaped nebula which the solar system is supposed to have

been condensed from. The comets may be divided into two very distinct classes
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                               273

--the first, the comets whose orbits are very long so long that they are usually

treated as parabolas ; the second, the comets of short period, about twelve or
fifteen in number.

     I found that the distribution of the inclinations of the orbits of the first group
was such as should naturally have resulted from a foreign origin of the comets,
and was not such as shoidd be expected on the hypothesis that they came to us
from a distant source or sources nearly in the plane of the solar system.

     The second group, however, consists of comets having orbits but little inclined

to the ecliptic, most of them having angles less than 30°. Two only have retro-

grade motions, Halley's comet, which has so long a period as almost to belono- to
the first group, and the comet of the November meteors (1866, i.). This latter is

probably identical with one of the two comets which crossed our sky in 1366, one
chasing the other along the path of the meteors just after the star shower of 'that
year. Even if 1866, i. be a third fragment, it must be classed amono-st the

periodic comets.

But with these two exceptions, the periodic comets have such a uniform relation

to the plane of the solar system as to compel the belief that there is something

peculiar to the group in their origin or history. If these comets came to us

at first from the stellar spaces, they have been turned into these short orbits by

coming very near to a large planet. Can we explain the nearly uniformly direct
Wemotion by supposing such a history for them ?
                                                     may state the question thus.

Suppose an immense number of comets to have passed in all conceivable directions

by and near to a large planet in such a way as to have their orbits greatly changed.
Some of those resulting orbits would be hyperbolas, in which the comets would

travel off into outer space. Others would be ellipses of short period, and part of
these woidd bring the comets near enough to the sun for us to see them.
Would a large majority of these last move around the sun in the same general

direction as the disturbing planet ?

    To answer this we have to ask how a comet must pass the planet to have its

velocity diminished ? For it is only by having its velocity diminished that a comet
can be turned from a parabolic orbit into one of short period. Though the general
problem of perturbations is veiy complex, yet there is an exceedingly "simple
answer to the above question, the simplicity being due to the fact that the pro-
blem is one of change of potentials only.

     If the comet pass in front of the planet the comet's attraction helps the planet
forward and increases the planet's velocity. The energy gained by the planet is lost
by the comet, and the comet's periodic time is therefore diminished. But if the
comet passes behind the planet their mutual attraction checks the planet's motion,
and hence increases the velocity of the comet. The simplicity of this law enables
ua to reduce the whole problem to elementary algebra and trigonometrv.

     It has been shown by Laplace that when a comet comes very near to a laro-e
planet we may divide the path into two parts. The first is so far from the planet

that it is regarded as an orbit about the sim with a small perturbation from the

planet. The second part is that near to the planet, where we may treat the relative

path as a conic section (hyperbola) about the planet, and then the sun's action is
only a small disturbing force.

Suppose now a sphere to be described about the planet, which shall be called

the sphere of action of the planet, of such size that, without the sphere, the planet's

action may be disregarded, and within it the small per-

turbing force of the sun disregarded. Draw a tangent to         B Fic.f.

that sphere at a point A, and let the plane of the paper be

the tangent plane. The planet will be on the perpendicidar   /

                                                             /

to the plane of the paper beyond A, and its line of motion

will meet the tangent plane in some point as B. In the
B Afigure assume to be in front of the planet. Join
A Adraw C perpendicular to B.                        B, and

Further, suppose that an indefinite number of comets approach the planet in
a relative direction perpendicular to the tangent plane, all having the same velo-
Acities. Those passing near to the point
                                          will go down and strike the planet.

Those passing behind the planet, that is meeting the plane in the figure on the side

Aof the line  beyond B, will gain velocity and possibly be thrown from elliptic

into hyperbolic orbits, along which they would travel off into space.

     Those on the other hand which meet the tangent plane in front of the line

A will in general lose velocity and be thrown into orbits having a diminished

periodic time. The amount of diminution will depend upon the point in which

ABC,the comet's path meets the plane     and those comets which suffer a given loss

will meet the plane in a locus whose equation may be determined.

Using polar co-ordinates,?making 6 the angle of a radius vector with AB, and

p the radius vector, the equation between p and 6 is found to be that of a

circle.

circle between p and 6 and constants.

If the comets of short period were thrown into their present orbits by Jupiter,

V2their velocities were diminished in general more than in the ratio             to 1.

With such a diminution the circle of fig. 1 is imaginary for wall values of

wless than about 70°, and is very small for all values of less than 90°. Hence

Jupiter can very rarely throw a comet whose motion is at all opposed in direction to

bis own from a parabolic orbit into one whose period is less than that of the planet.

On the contrary, when the comet approaches the planet from behind, the circle

wrapidly increases in size as approaches 180°. Hence of the comets which have

their orbits thus shortened, by far the largest proportion approach Jupiter from

behind. They go around the planet, and though their directions are thereby

greatly changed, yet after the change nearly all still follow the planet, that is

have a direct motion about the sun.

So far then from the direct motion of the periodic comets being a reason for

assigning to them a separate genesis from that of the other comets, that direct

motion is just what we ought to expect upon the supposition that the comets have

been thrown into their orbits by Jupiter or by other planets.
                                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                  275

     The two bodies, the comet and the planet, will of course in time, if undisturbed,
come back again to the place from which they parted company. The comet will
here undergo a new disturbance, perhaps pass close behind the planet and be
thrown out into the stellar spaces again.

     Some comets will by reason of smaller perturbations have their orbits so
 changed as to no longer come back to the appointed place of meeting, and these
may become more or less permanent members of the solar system.

    _ This conclusion suggests the possibility that the asteroids have also an outside
origin. If a comet were to be brought to move in a nearly circular orbit at a dis-
 tance from the large planets, and it is probably only such an orbit that can be
 really permanent, then the action of the sun by which the comet's tail is developed
 ought in the course of time to drive off all the matter that makes the comet's
 tail and leave the exhausted nucleus to travel in its orbit as a small planet.

     If in like manner we can suppose a like origin for some of the satellites, we
may be relieved of our difficulty. I cannot conceive how such small bodies can

become solid from a gaseous state in the immediate presence of the sun and the

large planets.

   A possible explanation of the lenticular form of the zodiacal light and its near

coincidence with the ecliptic is alike suggested. That body may be matter in

very minute parcels which has been thrown into this position by the action of the

planet Jupiter.

Ab. short Account of some Experiments made to determine the Friction of

      Water upon Water at low Velocities. Bu the Rev. Samuel Haughton

       M.D., D.C.L.

A spherical ball of granite, unpolished, was suspended by a pianoforte wire, and
allowed to hang freely
                                                                                                          ;  from the  brass collar, by which the ball was  suspended    an

index projected on each side, the pointed ends of the indices traversing a graduated

horizontal circle, whose centre corresponded with the line of suspension. °Tke sus-
pended ball was immersed in water contained in an iron tub.

The weight of the granite ball was 22452-85 grams, and its mean diameter was
2ol-46 millimeters. The length of the wire of suspension was 610-8 centimeters,
and its diameter was 0-889 millimeter. The diameter of the iron tub was 2 feet
4 inches, and the depth of water contained in it was 1 foot 9 inches.

The method of observation was as follows : the indices of the ball havin°- arrived

at the zero of rest, the ball was then displaced by a torsional movement of the wire
and allowed to regain its position of rest by a succession of vibrations, of diminish-
ing amplitudes.

    The quantities observed were the time of vibration and the rate of diminution of

the amplitude.

The equations of motion of the apparatus are thus found.

of tidal friction, and also to ascertain the elevation of water at the equator or pole,
necessary to cause a current ; both these results I hope to secure with some

approach to accuracy.

8. On Synchronism, of Mean Temperature and Rainfall in the Climate of
                     London. By H. Courtenay Fox, M.B.C.S.

My object is by tbe examination of a long series of facts to ascertain whether there

be any law which regulates the occurrence at the same time of extremes of tempera-

ture and rainfall, so far as we can ascertain it in the English climate.
    The facts which I have used are the rainfall and mean temperature as for the

Royal Observatory in each month and season for 66-67 years. The mean

temperature from 1813 to 1840 is that computed by James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S.

{vide Philosophical Transactions, 1850, part 7) ; and from 1841 to the present time
it is from direct observation. The rainfall from 1813 to 1840 is derived from

sundry observations about London collated by George Dines, Esq., F.M.S., and

from 1841 to the present time it also is from direct observation at the Greenwich

Observatory.

I have constructed tables/or each month, in which the sixty-seven (or sixty-six)

years are arranged in the order of the mean temperature of that month, beginning

with the coldest and ending with the warmest, and also arranged in like manner

in the order of their amount of rain. The sixty-seven years are then divided, as

nearly as can be, into five equal sections, of which the middle section is termed

average years ; the division on each side of the average I term cold and warm,

dry and rainy, respectively                                                                                                      while  the extreme sections I qualify by the word very,
                                                                                                                              ;

Wecalling them very cold, very warm, very dry, and very rainy, respectively.

have thus a pretty fair division of the series of years in both these characters.

What I have done for each month has been also done on exactly similar principles

for each season and for the whole year.

     1. In the winter months, cold tends to be synchronous with dryness, warmth with

--large rainfall. In January so strong is this tendency that the synchronism of cold

with dry is without marked exception (that is, there was no instance of a very dry
month being also a very warm one).

  --2. In the summer months, cold tends to be accompanied by much rain, warmth by

dryness. The synchronism of warm with dry in July, and that of cold with wet in

August, are both without marked exception.

  --3. To put this in popular language, rain brings warmth in winter and cold in

summer that is (if rain be cause, which is by no means proven), it mitigates the

special character of each extreme season, winter and summer.

4. But the peculiar laws of summer and winter are found to extend a little

over the adjoining months in the following manner. In November there are the

synchronisms, cold with dry, warm with wet ; and both October and March have a

slight tendency to the combination of cold with dryness, although there is in these

months indefinite relation between excess of rainfall and temperature. So that

there are six months, from October to March, of which four possess strongly the

winter character of cold with dry, warm with wet, and two have it to the extent
of slight cold with dry. On the other hand, the summer synchronism of warmth

with dryness obtains in April and to a small extent in May. The connection
between large rainfall and temperature in these months is ambiguous, but upon the

whole the balance is in favour of the union of cold with wet. Consequently we

have five months, from April to August, the last three of which possess the

summer character, warm with dry and cold with wet, whilst the first two exhibit
the same tendency in a much slighter, though still perceptible, degree. The only

definite tendency in September is to the synchronism of dry with warm, which so
 278 eeport-- 1879.

 far as it goes indicates a preference for the sestival rather than for the hyemal

  character.

   --5. Rainy years tend to be either very cold or very warm, whilst years of drought

 tend to assume an average temperature. The dry year is not (as we might expect
 if the summer synchronism prevailed) a veiy warm one, nor is it a very cold year (as

 would be the case if the winter tendency preponderated), but the two tendencies

 seem in each instance to balance one another. On the other hand, if the year be
 wet, either it will be also cold, as if it were the law of summer that chiefly
 affected it, or it will be warm, as though the temperature depended principally

 upon the winter synchronism.

     So far as my reading has extended, I am not aware that these striking laws

 hare been made public before. It would be an interesting subject for further

 inquiry to ascertain if they prevail for other parts of the globe, or whether they are
 peculiar to our insular position.

 9. Experiments on the Influence of the Angle of the Lip of Bain Gauges on

     the Quantity of Water Collected. By Baldwin Latham, G.E., M. Inst

       G.E., F.O.S., F.M.S., 8fc.

      The author having observed that, in the ordinary pattern of the Glaisher gauge,
in high winds the rain was often driven up the sloping lip and into the gauge,
 thought that if the rim of the gauge were made very acute, having a sharp knife
 edge and equal angles both inside and outside the gauge, any rain which might
 strike upon the outer angle on one side of the gauge might be thrown into the
 gauge. Rain striking upon the inner and opposite side of the gauge would be
 thrown out, and so an equilibrium rim would be constructed, as the gain on one
 side would be balanced by the loss on the other side.

     With this view, the author had an 8- inch gauge made and tested alongside of
an 8-inch Glaisher gauge. The sloping lip of the Glaisher gauere had an angle of
45° from the perpendicular, and the rim of the equilibrium gauge was -8 in. deep,

 ·18 in. in thickness, sloping off on both sides at an angle of 3° from the perpen-
 dicular. Both gauges were fixed at Croydon, 4 feet above the ground, and 259 feet
above the Ordnance datum. These gauges had been working side by side for 551
days, from January 5, 1878, to July 5, 1879, during which period rain or snow has

fallen upon 806 occasions. Upon 43 occasions it was found that the rain collected
in the Glaisher gauge exceeded, by a small amount, the rain in the equilibrium
rim-gauge, and on two occasions the quantity in the new gauge exceeded that in
the Glaisher gauge. Upon 261 occasions the rain in both gauges was absolutely
equal. On all occasions, it should be observed, the rain from both gauges was
invariably measured in the same graduated measuring glass. On the 45 occasions
when the Glaisher gauge collected most rain, the wind without exception was
high. On the two occasions when the equilibrium rim-gauge collected more rain
than the Glaisher gauge, it was probably due to dew, the equilibrium gauge pre-
senting a larger surface for condensation than the other gauge. As the Glaisher
gauge was not calculated to contain snow, all falls of snow are recorded in the
equilibrium rim-gauge, which is constructed to hold about one foot in depth of

snow.

     The total quantity of rain collected in the Glaisher gauge during' the period of
observation, plus the snow as caught in the equilibrium rim-gauge, was 46-68 in.,
and the quantity collected in the equilibrium rim-gauge was 46-45 in., showing
a difference of but half per cent. In all probability, however, the small excess
measured by the Glaisher gauge would tend to compensate for the losses by
evaporation in periods of small rainfall and at other times, and therefore, as a
measuring gauge, the Glaisher pattern of gauge, when tested by a gauge of the:
description mentioned, gives results in practice which may be taken as correct.

      11. On an improved, Bain Gauge. By N. Lowenthal Lonsdale.

     This gauge records the exact quantity of rain and snow on paper as well as on
a tell-tale dial. The funnel is suspended on an enclosure with a sloping roof and
two air pipes, within which enclosure, in winter, a small flame is kept burning to

melt the snow in the funnel. From the funnel the water runs into an intermediate

receiver, which can be closed by a valve. When open, the water rims on into

a larger receiver, where a float with a tube in the centre rises and falls. This
tube is closed at the top, aud embraces a long open tube fixed in the centre of the
large receiver, the two together thus forming an intermittent siphon, the diameters
of the inner and outer tubes of which must be, at least, as 2 to 3. To the top of
the float is fixed a rod with a pencil, for marking a sheet as usual. The rod also
moves an index which marks whole inches, and another for fractions.

12. On a Galvanometer for demonstrating the Internal Current transmitted
    through the Liquid within a Voltaic Cell. By Conrad W. Cooke, C.E.,

     M.S., T.E. 1

It is of course well known that when the external circuit of a voltaic cell is closed

a current of electricity is transmitted through that circuit, and at the same time a

current of equal strength is transmitted through the liquid within the cell from one

plate to the other. The former of these is detected by its electro-magnetic and

electro-chemical effects, producing deflections in galvanometers and electroscopes

and sounds in telephonic instruments, and is utilised in all the applications of

voltaic electricity.

As far as the author has been able to find out, there has not hitherto been any

satisfactory means in the hands of the demonstrator of physics by which the

existence of the internal cm-rent within a single cell can be made apparent.

Faraday, in the course of his early researches, made the following experiment : he

suspended a magnetic needle by a silk thread, aud lowered it into the liquid between

the plates of one cell of a voltaic battery, so that its length should lie in a plane

perpendicular to those of the plates ; and he observed that when the needle was

just below the surface of the liquid it was deflected the moment that the external

current was closed. On lowering it still deeper (the current being maintained

complete) its deflection gradually diminished as the depth of immersion was in-

creased, until it reached a position about half the depth of the liquid, when it

returned to zero                                                                              and after passing this depth it was  again deflected, but this time
                                                                                           ;

in the opposite direction, its amount of deflection in either case increasing as its

distance from the neutral or central point was increased. The cause of this phe-

--nomenon is obvious from the following considerations : If a wire conveying an

electric current be held above and parallel to a magnetic needle, the latter, obeying

Ampere's law, will be deflected with an angular displacement dependent upou the

strength of the current and its distance from the needle ; and if the same wire be

held below the needle, the latter will be similarly deflected, but in the opposite

Nowdirection.                                                                                 the flow of electricity through the liquid in a voltaic cell may

(for the purpose of this explanation) be looked upon as made up of an infinite

number of currents transmitted in a horizontal direction from one plate to the

other                        and when                                                         a  magnetic  needle  is  immersed  j ust  below  the  surface  of the
                          ;

liquid, a series of currents are flowing in one direction below it, and a correspond-
ing deflection takes place ; when, however, it is lowered deeper into the solution
a certain number of currents are flowing below it tending to deflect it in one
direction, and a certain number are flowing above it tending to deflect it in the
opposite direction, and its permanent deflection is due to the electro-magnetic

effect of the difference between the two. When these become equal, as they are

when the needle is at the middle of its depth, their effects on the needle are
balanced and neutralised, and no deflection takes place ; and when that point is

passed the currents above the needle are in excess of those below it, and a corre-

sponding deflection in an opposite direction is given to the needle.
     Professor Hughes, by placing in the circuit of a battery an apparatus, such as

a clock-microphone, or a key, by which an intermittent or undulatory character

may be given to its current, and holding one side of a rectangular coil of wire in

circuit with a Bell telephone over one of the cells of his three-cell battery, a
secondary intermittent or undulatory current was indxiced in the coil by that
portion of the primary circuit transmitted through the cell, and a corresponding
ticking was heard in the telephone.

     In both these experiments, however, the effects observed must be attributed

rather to the external current of the other cells than to the internal current of the
cell under examination ; and the author is unaware that any successful attempt has

hitherto been made to construct an instrument which shall utilise the ivhole of the

internal current of a single voltaic cell for the production of electro-magnetic
effects. "While engaged in some experiments a few years ago it occurred to the

author that if a voltaic cell were divided into two portions, having the zinc element
in one portion, and the positive element in the other, and the solution contained in
the one portion were connected to that in the other by a tube filled with the same
liquid, the tube being coiled round a magnetic needle, a deflection of the latter,
due to the current within the cell being forced by the convolutions of the tube to
circulate around the needle, would be produced when the two elements were con-

nected together. An apparatus (which was before the section) was then constructed.

This instrument consists of two glass test tubes united together by a small tube about
two feet long, and convoluted into two circular coils after the manner of a Thomson's
Reflecting Galvanometer. Within the coils is suspended an astatic system of
magnetic needles, of which the upper carries a light mirror by which its deflections

may be made apparent by the movement of a spot of light on a screen. It may

therefore in this respect be looked upon as a Thomson's Reflecting Galvanometer,
coiled with liquid instead of with metallic wires. The elements are placed one in

each of the little cells, and may be connected by a key ; or, by placing a reflecting
galvanometer in the external circuit, both currents may be simultaneously indicated

on the screen, and their interdependence or identity be demonstrated.

    The author is indebted to Mr. Gimingham, whose name is now inseparably con-

nected with the splendid researches of Mr. Orookes, for being able to produce the
instrument on the table, in which the tubes and coils are of glass, all in one piece,
and is a very beautiful specimen of accurate glass blowing. Below the base of
the instrument is a fine slightly magnetised sewing needle, which can be rotated
on a vertical axis through a small angle by means of a little lever, and by which

the instrument may be adjusted to zero.

     Tbis well-known fact is explained in a simple manner. If the cbarge moved
slowly of course a very small pressure of air would drive out tbe obstacle, wbicb
offers a very small resistance. But in practice a cbarge travels with a speed of
more tban 1,000 feet a second, tbe velocity of sound, and greater tban tbe velocity
witb wbicb tbe pressure of air in front of tbe cbarge can be transmitted along tbe
bore. Consequently we bave a layer of air in intense pressure in front of tbe

cbarge, and tbe obstruction cannot be forced out until tbis layer readies it, so as to
give it tbe velocity of tbe cbarge in tbe time taken for it to leave tbe muzzle. Tbe
mathematical investigation sbows tbat tbe pressure generated witb a plug of tbe

density of air is 7h tons. Tbis pressure is independent of tbe size of bore of
tbe gun and of tbe length of tbe plug.

since the last Report of the Committee on Electrical Standards, September 4,

1867.

At that time it was thought worth while to issue a provisional unit of capacity

to meet the requirements of the electric telegraph service, in the shape of a mica-

paraffin condenser of capacity to be determined by the ballistic method; but

according to the Report no decision had then been arrived at whether the new unit

should be issued by the Committee or on Professor Jenkin's own responsibility. In an

appendix to that Report, Professor Jenkin has published the results of several deter-

minations of the capacity of a certain condenser of Mr. Latimer Clark's construction,

adjusted to equal 10_u electro-magnetic absolute units ; in the values he obtained

there was an approximation of only - 42 per cent, between the mean and any single

result, so that copies of such a preliminary standard would probably not have been

correct within much less than 1 per cent.

This apparent variation of capacity was due chiefly to the absorption of charge

by the dielectric used to separate the conducting plates ; and, I believe, this con-

denser, and others made like it at the time, have failed altogether in insulation since.

    In 1869 I carried out a series of experiments for Messrs. Clark & Muirhead, to

determine the best and most durable dielectric to use in the construction of con-

densers for the electrical testing and working of submarine telegraph cables, and I

soon found that a given dielectric absorbed less, the freer it was from foreign

matter. The materials that seemed best suited for the purpose were paper, mica,

paraffin, and shellac. Several condensers were made in the manner described by

Professor Jenkin in Appendix IV. to the above-mentioned Report, in which these

materials were used, purified in different ways, great care being taken in every

case to prevent the deposition of moisture on the plates during the construction of

the condensers. The plates that showed the least amount of absorption, with ordi-

dinary differences of potential, were those made of mica coated with shellac, that

had been purified with absolute alcohol. The condenser which I now exhibit was

constructed of such plates, and its capacity adjusted to equal one-third of a micro-

farad on comparison with four condensers lent to me by Mr. Latimer Clark and

Mr. Forde, one of which was the condenser referred to above in Professor Jenkin's

report, and the other three were made from it by Messrs. Laws and Lambert,

assistants to Mr. Latimer Clark. According to my own determinations at the time,

by the ballistic method, using a needle whose period of vibration was 8 seconds, its

value was -331 microfarad, and I decided to take as correct the mean - 332 of this,

and the value - 333 got by comparison with the four condensers referable to Pro-

fessor Jenkin's determinations. Ever since then, copies have been made of this

condenser and supplied by Elliott Bros., the late firm Warden & Co., and Clark,
Muirhead & Co. to manufacturers of scientific apparatus and others as standards

the number so issued is over 600. From the close agreement of the determinations

just made by Mr. Hockin (a member of the late Committee on Electrical Standards),

of the capacity of this condenser with mine made nine years ago (vide his note ap-

pended to this), it will be seen that probably no change greater than one-third

per cent, has taken place in it, and, therefore, one might confidently recommend the

British Association either to adopt this form of condenser as their temporary

standard, or to appoint another committee to re-investigate the subject. I might

add that I found very little absorption in condensers of brass plates embedded in

paraffin wax allowed to solidify under pressure, and also in some made with silvered

glass plates embedded in the same manner. In the absolute determination of the

capacity of these condensers by discharge through a galvanometer, no greater

differences than one-third per cent, need be made in the results, even with needles

varying in period of vibration by as much as from 2| seconds to 25 seconds. This

is the result of experience                                                                                                                      and  in  defining  the capacity it will be sufficient for all
                                                                                                                                              ;

of measurement adopted.

I have asked Professor Ayrton to draw the attention of the Section to the fact

that there is no one authorised to certify to the correctness of copies of the

various electrical standards originated by the British Association. I would sug-

gest that some public body, such as the Kew Observatory, be asked to undertake

    9. Note on the Capacity of a certain Condenser, and on the value of V.

                                     By C. Hockin, M.A.

     The observations given in this paper were first begun with the object of re-
determining the value of the capacity of certain condensers employed in the practical
testing of cables, and in terms of which the capacity of many cables now submerged

have been recorded and published.

    Dr. Muirhead and Professor Ayrton stated to me that they proposed to draw

the attention of the British Association to the desirability of recognising some one

condenser or condensers as a provisional standard.

     Fully concurring in their views on this point, I have determined in various ways
the capacity of a condenser made by Dr. Muirhead several years ago, and the
particulars of which he has given in his paper.

    The agreement of the value of the condenser now with the value it had when
first made is satisfactory, as showing the permanence of a well made condenser.

     The order of the experiments made was as follows :

   A1. condenser was built up of silvered glass plates insulated from each other

by three small fragments of shellac.
     2. The capacity of the glass condenser was determined by the ' ballistic ' method,

the deflection of a Thompson's galvanometer needle being observed.
     3. The glass or air condenser was compared with three other condensers by the

null method, that is to say, the glass condenser was charged to a definite positive,
say, potential, and one of the other condensers to some lower negative potential
such that when the two condensers were connected the potential of each fell to zero

immediately after the connection.

     4. The capacities of the three condensers last mentioned were determined by
the throw of the needle of a Thompson's galvanometer moving freely, and having a
period of oscillation which was varied from 2'9 seconds to 25 seconds.

     5. The rate at which the condensers lost their charge when the opposite plates
were connected by a known large resistance was determined.

   A6. correction in one case has been applied for absorption determined by

observing the rate at which the potential of the condenser varied when after
discharging through a known resistance for given times, the circuit of the high

resistance was suddenly broken.
     The glass condenser was thus made.

    A hundred circles of the best flat plate glass were obtained and silvered on both

sides by the chemical process. They were supplied by Messrs. Farmiloe & Sons.

      These were carefully examined, and any spots observed not covered by the

silver were covered with gold leaf secured by a little very weak gum or by a trace

 of lard.

     Connection was made with the surfaces of the glass plates by soldering a
thin copper wire to them with an alloy of cadmium and bismuth melting at a
 very low temperature.

     Fifty plates had a diameter of 127 mm. and 50 were of considerably greater

 diameter.

      The plates were built up thus.

    A plate of shellac was made with flat sides by pouring melted shellac on a
                                                                        --

stout plate of glass about 12 mm. thick, and pressing the melted lac into a disc

hy another similar plate of glass, the two plates being separated by slips of thin

glass.

The plate so pressed was cut into small pieces, and the thickness of each piece
^~measured, the fragments having the same thickness (within
                                                                                         of an inch) beino-

placed together.

A stout piece of good plate glass was covered with tin-foil, and on this in

proper position three little pieces of lac were laid to support the first small circle of

glass                           on this three other pieces were placed over  the first   three pieces to support
                             ;

the first large circle, and so on to the end. Care was taken to select the three

pieces supporting each plate of the same thickness.

     The mean distance between the plates was determined by measuring the height
of the pile when completed, and the height after removing the shellac separating

the plates.

     The mean area of the shellac by weighing the fragments used and comparing
their weight with that of a piece of the plate from which they were cut of such size
that its dimensions could be measured with some accuracy.

The three other condensers used (called A, B, C) were

       me and used for comparison.

         from the condenser described by Professor Jenkin in his paper ' British
          Association Reports,' 1867.

The method of observation was as follows :

     a. The time of oscillation of a galvanometer needle was observed.

     b. The deflection of the galvanometer needle produced by a steady current was
noted, the current being either that produced by the battery employed to charge
the condenser flowing through a resistance of from 500,000 to 1,000,000 ohms or
else a current produced by any other battery, the electromotive force between
two points in the circuit separated by a known resistance being determined
in terms of the electromotive force employed to charge the condenser.

     c. The condenser was charged and discharged several times. As it was found

impracticable to maintain the galvanometer needle at rest absolutely when the
time of oscillation was great, the method employed was to reduce the oscillations

to a small amount, 2, 3, or 4 divisions, read three successive oscillations and
discharge the condenser at the moment that the needle was at rest and on the
point of changing its direction of motion. The mean of the second deflection and
the half sum of the first and third deflections is taken as the zero, and the total
excursion of the needle in the case in question is not altered by the fact that the
needle started from a position of rest but not of equilibrium.

    In fact, let G be the angle defining the extreme excursion of the needle due
a given impulse applied to it when it was at rest in a position of equilibrium

needle is defined by the angle 6, and is oscillating through an angle <9,, on either side
of its zero point. Then (neglecting the effect of air resistance)

-- a convenient expression sufficiently accurate for most practical cases.
   --The time of oscillation was determined as follows : The needle was brought

to rest, started by discharging a condenser through the galvanometer exactly at the
beat of a chronometer ; by listening to the beats the periods of the first five swings
of the needle were observed and registered, a certain number (usually ten) of oscil-
lations were then counted, and the periods of five successive swings again measured,
and so on.

    The mean of the first five observations, the second five, and so on were
treated as the time of the 2nd, 16th, 30th, &c, oscillation. No sensible change
in period due to extent of oscillation was observed.

     In this manner results agreeing within 0-1 per cent, were readily obtained.

     The galvanometer was inclosed in an iron chest of J in. wrought iron with a
small opening to admit the light to the needle. The zero of the instrument re-

--mained very constant even when the period of oscillation was large 25 seconds

for example.

The needles were made of little pieces of watch spring hardened and well mag-

netised                              the  lower  series  being  attached to   a brass disc  fixed   to  an  aluminium

     The condenser was then taken to pieces and set up again. In the second case

the larger plates were separated by pieces cut from a plate of flat plate glass, and
the smaller plates resting on them were insulated by three very small fragments of

shellac.

     The distance of the surfaces was determined in this case differently. Fifty
small plates were used. The 150 slips of glass separating the larger plates were

cleaned with nitric acid, brushed with a camel's hair pencil, and piled on each
other on an inclined metre scale, and the total height measured several times.

     The small plates were brushed in like manner, placed on each other, resting on
a plate of flat glass, and another large stout plate placed on them, with a weight of
about 3 kilos. The distance between the glass plates was measured with a pair of

inside calipers at four points on a circle, concentric with the pile of small plates.

From the data thus obtained the average distance apart of the inducing surfaces

13. Improved Photographic Screens. By J. H. Stabling, F.G.S., A.I.C.

There have been many attempts from time to time to devise a particular form of

lens-covering or cap for photographic cameras which would permit the operator to

expose or cover the lens as quickly as possible, and with the least possible disturb-

ance of the apparatus.

The old and usual form of cap cannot be said to fulfil these requirements, since

the rapidity of manipulation depends entirely upon the operator. Moreover, how-

iever skilfully this is used, it is almost impossible to avoid disturbing the apparatus

more or less.
    The spring sliding shutter, which is by no means a new invention, although an

improvement as regards mere mechanism in the above, can only be used for rapid

Aworking.   third form of lens-covering has been devised by a Mr. Cadet, which

consists simply of a circular disc, which can be made to open or shut externally or
internally on an ordinary hinge by means of suitable mechanism.

It occurred to the inventors that the kind of covering which would meet the prac-

tical requirements necessary for the perfect working of a camera must be one which

should open if possible from the centre, and be so under the control of the operator

as to be opened or shut either rapidly or slowly, and at the same time noiselessly,

so that it might be used either for landscape, photography, or portraiture.
     The present invention, which I have the honour of bringing before your notice,

may without doubt be said to fulfil these somewhat difficult conditions.
    By means of a suitable transmitting power, which may be used at any required

distance from the camera, the covering, which you will perceive consists of two
peculiarly curved halves, is caused to be opened or shut much in the same manner

as a pair of shears, thus exposing the lens from the first at the centre, and gradually

increasing the opening towards the circumference. This may be done rapidly or

     In this instrument, which is not yet finished, there will he two collimators placed
parallel to one another, provided with horizontal slits which lie in the same right
line. The telescopes will also he parallel, and will he in a convenient inclined
position. Between them lie the prisms, which are a semiprism, a complete prism,
and another semiprism of bisulphide of carbon, plunged in a tank of water, and
connected by Mr. Grubb's simple automatic motion, which consists of a link and
two cogged wheels. The angles of the prisms will be large, their faces disks of
optical glass five inches square, and the collimators and telescopes are of two-inch
aperture. With this instrument the spectrum will be spread out vertically, and

the lines in it will be horizontal.

     In this arrangement, which is easily constructed by an amateur, and which has
worked for a long time satisfactorily, the collimator and telescope are fixed on two

Aboards, and B, jointed together by a hinge, the prisms stand on little wooden
Atables, a and b, which turn on pivots fixed in the boards, and B, under the

middles of the first and last surfaces of the prisms respectively. The motion of
each of these tables is trammelled by a link, connecting a projection from the front
of tbe table with a point on the front of the board upon which it does not stand,
the radius from the first end of the link to the pivot on which the little table turns
bein" four times the radius from the other end of the link to the hinge of the
boards, and these radii being parallel to one another when the instrument is set
upon the middle of the spectrum. Thus the table a is connected by its link with
the front of the board B, and the table b with the board A. Strips of brass are
let into the wood to receive the holes in which the pivots and links work, and the
links are also of brass. One of the links is arched upwards and the other down-
wards, sufficiently to clear each other. Pencilled lines are drawn on the little
tables to mark the proper positions of the prisms, so that they can be replaced
without delay after they have been removed.

294 REPORT 1879.

Afor the manufacture of the finer varieties of cutlery and edged tools, &c.  brief
--outline of the process itself is as follows : The most of the iron employed for this

purpose is imported into this country in the shape of bars from Sweden, where it

has been smelted from very pure iron ores, in a blast furnace, by the aid of charcoal,

and subsequently puddled to free it from impurities.

The first operation to which it is subjected, is that known as the cementation or

converting process, the object of which is to combine a certain quantity of carbon

with the iron ; this operation is performed in a furnace of peculiar construction,

where the iron and charcoal are packed together in air-tight chests or converting

pots, subjected to a high temperature short of the fusing point of iron, where it

remains for a matter of three weeks.

After the conversion, when the pots are cold the bars are taken out and found

to be covered with blisters, hence it is termed Blister Steel. In consequence of the

various theories proposed to account for this peculiar formation, the writer was

induced to make a series of investigations. For this purpose he was kindly fur-

nished by Messrs. Seebohm and Dieckstahl of the Dannemora Steel Works, with

some samples of this blister steel, various portions of which he submitted to

analysis, the results of which showed a marked increase of silicon where the blisters

occurred, thus

    On inspecting one of these bars of blister steel it is found that it has undergone

both a physical and a chemical change

    The iron has now assumed a crystalline structure, and has chemically combined
with a certain amount of carbon. This latter change commences on the exterior,

and extends itself to the interior of the bar, if the process be continued sufficiently
long, thus showing that carbonic oxide never penetrates into the centre of the bar,
until the whole is converted into steel.

     The writer is indebted to the kindness of the above-mentioned firm for a sample
of bar iron, before and after conversion, in order to ascertain the exact chemical
change that took place during the process. The following are the results obtained :

     The steel is now broken up into small pieces and melted in crucibles, and cast

 into ingots. These are sent to the forge, -where they are heated and rolled. In
 this part of the process the chief difficulty with which the silter has to contend is
 the porous or ' honey-combed ' structure of the steel.

     One of the characteristic features relied on by practical men as indicating the
 quality of a piece of steel is the appearance of its fracture ; but this is by no means
 an infallible test, as the fineness or coarseness of grain can be produced by

 mechanical treatment or chemical means.

      The characteristic property possessed by steel is its capability of being hardened
 and tempered. The temper of cast steel may be said to range from 075 to T50
 per cent, carbon. The temper of steel is an important question in connection with
 the purpose for which it is required, thus a steel containing 1-50 per cent, of carbon
is the class employed for razors. l - 25 per cent, is that known as ' tool temper.'
Steel containing TOO per cent, carbon is termed 'chisel steel,' and this temper is

 extensively used in the arts.

     The favourite marks of Swedish now employed in the manufacture of this kind
of steel, are those obtained from Dannemora, the most noted of which are the 00 =

Double Bullet, Q, = GL, and (l) = Hoop L.

      The most important of the elements which affect the quality and mechanical

properties of steel are the following :
      Carbon, Silicon, Sulphur, Phosphorus, and Manganese.
      Carbon, by its direct combination with iron, is essentially the steel-forming ele-

ment, and greatly increases the hardness and tensile strength of the metal. The
maximum quantity of carbon capable of being taken up by iron is 6 -5 per cent, to

7 - 00 per cent. This high percentage of carbon is only attained, as in the case of

rich Ferromanganese, containing as much as from 85 to 86 per cent, of mangauese.

   --Silicon. The action of this element on steel is to produce both red and cold

shortness, especially in high made steels. Under certain conditions, it is capable
of imparting hardness without brittleness. The presence of this element also tends
to favour a solid casting, and prevent the formation of a honey-combed structure.

      Sulphur in steel, as is well known, produces ' red shortness,' and has also a ten-
dency to prevent the chemical combination of iron with carbon, and also to dis-
place it when in combination.

      Phosphorus produces cold shortness and brittleness, but the detrimental influence

of this element, when present only in small quantities, can be partially neutralised,

providing the percentage of carbon is very low.
     Manganese is a valuable ally of the steel melter, and serves to correct the evil

effects produced by the presence of sulphur, oxygen, &c. ; and when in the state of

an oxide serves to eliminate a large percentage of the silicon.
     Mangauese is generally introduced into the steel in the form of ' Spiegeleisen,' an

alloy of iron, carbon, and manganese, generally containing about 10 per cent, of the

latter element.

     Other metals have been employed to replace carbon, such as tungsten, chromium,
and titanium : these impart great hardness and fineness to the texture of steel.

     For a considerable amount of practical information given in his paper, but
necessarily omitted from this abstract, the writer is indebted to a valuable essay

--written some years ago on this subject by Henry Seebohm, Esq., of the firm of

Messrs. Seebohm & Dieckstahl. This paper is not intended to give any additional

information to the practical steel makers of Sheffield, as to the manufacture of
steel, or to offer any criticisms or advice in the matter; its object is simply to give
an outline of the manufacture as it is still carried on in tbis town, with tbe hope

that it may prove interesting to many of those who have come from a distance to
attend the visit of the British Association, and who are unacquainted with the pro-

cess which has caused Sheffield to become the great manufacturing steel centre in

this country.

3. On the Separation of Iron and Phosphorus, specially with reference to the
                     Momifactvre of Steel. By Thomas Blaik.

     The larger proportion of iron ores raised in this and most other countries con-
tain so much phosphorus as to render them unsuitable for the manufacture of steel.
Pig irons made from pure haematite ores, containing 003 to 0-00 per cent, of

phosphorus, are alone suitable for this purpose. The bulk of iron made from English

ores contains - 50 to 1*50 per cent.

     Steel made from phosphoretic iron is excessively brittle when cold, and is, con-
sequently, unsuited for most purposes. In a high-class steel the phosphorus should

never reach 0-10 per cent. ; but in second qualities it is not unusual to find 0-20
or 0-25 per cent.

    As the removal of this objectionable element is very necessary, numerous
attempts have been made to eliminate it in the various stages of the manufacture

of iron and steel.

M. Jacobi based a process for removing phosphorus from ores containing it as

calcium-phosphate, on the fact that this salt is soluble in an aqueous solution of

sulphurous acid gas; but although he effected this removal commercially, the
process was impracticable, owing to the circumstance that it was necessary to

pulverise the ore, thereby unfitting it for exclusive use in the blast furnace.

The action of the smelting operation is such that not only is all the iron reduced,

but also other elements, notably phosphorus, silicon, sulphur, carbon, and man-

ganese                             and  it  is  only  during  disordered working, when  oxide  of  iron  is  beino-
                                ;

slagged off, that any of the phosphorus existing in the mineral is removed. In the

earlier davs of iron smelting, when the furnaces used were very imperfect, it was
possible to make excellent iron from ores which now give a very inferior product

in the modern furnace, owing to this fact.

No method has as yet been discovered by which phosphorus and iron can be

separated during smelting.

Up to the time of Bessemer's invention pig-iron was usually purified in the

puddling process, the principle of which is the washing out of phosphide of iron by

intimate contact with fused oxide of iron. Silicon and carbon are also removed,

and wrought-iron of good quality can be made by this process from iron containing
much phosphorus. Some of the silicon, and small quantities of phosphorus and

carbon, are sometimes removed previous to puddling by the action of an air blast,
and addition of oxide of iron, in the refinery, or ' running-out fire.'

     The Henderson process has been very successful in removing the whole of the
phosphorus rapidly during puddling ; it consists in the addition of fluor-spar and

titaniferous ore.

     In the Bessemer process the carbon and silicon are rapidly and completely
removed, but the phosphorus actually increases in quantity, or rather becomes con-

centrated, since the iron is to some extent oxidized, while the phosphorus remains
unattached. The siliceous lining of the converter forbids the existence of a basic
slag, which is the condition necessary for its removal.

     In the Siemens' process the same state of things exists, and since the greater
proportion of the steel made in the world is the product of these two processes, it
will be readily seen that the use of phosphoretic irons is very necessary, and in fact,

is now a burning question since many articles formerly made of puddled iron, such
as rails, are now made of steel. Iron ores suitable for puddled iron are consequently

unfitted for the production of iron for steel-making.

     The first process suggested for the rapid removal of phosphorus was that of
Mr. Isaac Lowthian Bell, who proposed to wash the molten pig-iron with a lar°-e

quantity of molten oxide of iron. By this means he succeeded in removing as
much as 90 per cent, of the phosphorus.

      Krupp's process consists in forming a thick coating of manganiferous iron ore
on the bottom of a Pernot-Siemens furnace, and melting pig-iron thereon. It is
stated that good results have been arrived at by this method.

     The use of alkaline chlorides, fluorides, and other salts, have also been suc-

cessful, likewise the action of chlorine gas in presence of an excess of carbon.
                                                               ----

In 187:J Mr. G. J. Snelus pointed out that phosphorus could he eliminated by

the maintenance of a basic slag in the Bessemer converter. Having noticed that
certain kinds of magnesian limestone became indurated when tired hard, he lined

up a vessdl with such lime, and in it successfully dephosphorised Cleveland pig-

iron containing about 1-50 per cent, of phosphorus.

Messrs. Thomas and Gilchrist have during the past year successfully worked out

a process which is likely to be universally adopted. It is briefly, as follows :

A1st.  durable basic lining.

2nd. Additions of basic material.

3rd. Continuing the blast after the carbon has been fully oxidized, for the pur-

pose of scorifying phosphorus.

Bricks of the following composition are made by firing at a temperature nearly

equal to the melting point of platinum, and are very durable.

   A proper selection of the stone is all that is necessary ; the presence of silica

and alumina causes ' fritting,' and the bricks are very sound. Silicate of soda has
been used, and Mr. E. Riley has made a lining by using petroleum or kindred oils,
to render the lime plastic.

     The additions of magnesian limestone, with or without mixture with oxide of
iron, are made at the commencement of the process, resulting in the rapid removal
of silicon ; the carbon then commences to disappear, and when this has gone the
phosphorus goes.

     On the addition of spiegeleisen, the manganese, reacting on the phosphoric acid

contained in the slag, causes a portion of the phosphorus to return to the metal.
Hence the blown metal, with - 076 per cent, of phosphorus, is converted into
steel, with 0-177 per cent, by addition of spiegeleisen. This reaction was discovered
by Mr. Stead, some years ago.

     In the refining and puddling processes, as also in Bell's, the silicon and phos-
phorus are removed at the same time, and the carbon later, the elimination of
phosphorus ceasing as soon as the carbon begins to go, whereas in the Thomas
and Gilchrist process the carbon is all gone before the phosphorus commences to
scorify. M. Pourcel argues from the foregoing that a highly silicious pig would
be better than one low in silicon, but experience teaches that an excess of this
element is very undesirable, owing to the fact that the blow is prolonged, an in-
creased quantity of slag is made, the waste is greater, and the corrosive action of
the silica on the lime lining is excessive. At present, however, the presence of
silicon is necessary as a source of heat. Attempts have been made by Bell, Wilks,
and Hollway to add carbon to the bath during blowing, as a source of heat.
Hollway proposes to burn the flame within the vessel itself, by means of a separate
range of tuyeres.

     Some objections have been raised as to the commercial possibility of the manu-
facture of steel by such processes; these may be answered as follows:

     1st. Every kind of pig iron made is capable of treatment. Pigs high in silicon

are objectionable, for the reasons previously stated.

     2nd. Operations on a large scale are even more successful than experimental

trials.

     3rd. The waste is found to be 17 to 18 per cent., only 2 per cent, higher than
in the ordinary Bessemer process. The amount of slag made is from 3£ to ft cwt.
per ton of pig iron used. The after-blowing is not a source of waste, inasmuch as
that the iron does not commence to oxidise, until practically the whole of the car-
bon and phosphorus are burnt out.

     4th. The corrosive action on the lining is greater than in the ordinary Bessemer
process, but when blowing iron low iu silicon the linin'cg answers well.

298 report -1879.

     5th. It has been said that the result of the process will be uncertain. In prac-
tice this is not found to be the case ; in 20 blows the phosphorus was found to
range from 0-04 to 0-14 per cent., and the analysis of numerous samples proves the

steel to be of excellent quality. In a few cases, however, when the blast was not
continued long enough, as much as 0-2 per cent, has been found.

    6th. The sources of extra cost may be summed up as follows :
     1. The slightly increased waste.
     2. The labour necessary to deal with the extra slag.
     3. The cost of the bassic additions.
     4. The extra cost of linings.
     5. The decreased output of the plant, it being necessary to blow smaller charges

owing to the slag, and the risk of splashing ; and also the time occupied in taking

samples.

     6. The smaller production of the blast furnace while' smelting poor phosphoretic
ores, than when smelting rich haematite ores. This, however, it is contended, is

already considered in the price of such iron.

    The margin between Cleveland and Bessemer pig iron is now about 10s. per
ton, but when prices reach a normal state it will be more than this. There is,
therefore, that sum to work upon, and it does not appear that the items mentioned
will amount to even 7s. Qd. per ton.

    As a set-off against the cost of the process may be considered the fact that
enormous deposits of cheap iron ore, now worthless for steel making, will be

utilised, and that existing works will prolong their lives, especially those within
easy reach of coal and ironstone.

     It bas been gravely asserted that steel made by any of the processes described
cannot be of equal quality to that made from pure iron. This is simply an assertion
not based on fact. Steel of good chemical composition, sound and clean, is as good
as any other of the same composition, irrespective of how, where, or from what it
is made It appears to be every day more and more probable that Bessemer and
Siemens steel will gradually replace the liner qualities, now made by very ex-

pensive processes.

            A4. New Process in Metallurgy. By John Hollway.

     The theory of this process has been developed from known principles, aided by
experimental work undertaken for the purpose of investigating the action of rapid
oxidation upon pyritous substances, with a view to their metallurgic treatment
upon a large scale. Before these experiments were made, metallurgists had not

realised the fact that pyrites and other sulphides (even with the addition of a
considerable proportion of incombustible materials) can be decomposed and fused by
the heat developed in the oxidation which takes place whenever air is rapidly

brought into contact with an excess of molten sulphides. When this is effected by

introducing air under pressure through apertures of a few millimetres in diameter
in the bottom of a hearth upon which the molten sulphides lie, the results pro-

duced are very remarkable. Thus when cupreous pyrites was so treated, a true
combustion of the more oxidisable constituents took place, flame and incandescence

resulted, and the decomposition was effected with great rapidity.
     It was primarily surmised that in this manner, neglecting the influence of

mass, the elements would be burnt in the regular order of their relative affinities
for oxygen, and that the second atom of sulphur in iron pyrites, which can be ex-
pelled by fusion, would escape oxidation in the molten bath and be volatilised in
the current of sulphurous acid and nitrogen emerging from the surface of the
molten liquid. The more volatile oxides and sulphides in the material operated
upon, such as those of arsenic, antimony, lead, and zinc would volatilise with this
freed sulphur, and condense partly before the latter, though more or less contami-
nating that product. If the oxidation be arrested at a point determinable by prac-
tice, calculation, or some marked change in the spectrum, two products of different
specific gravity will be obtained, namely a slag of silicate of iron, lime, alumina,
----

&c, containing the iron protoxide resulting from the oxidation of the iron sulphide,
combined as silicate with the siliceous fluxing materials present in the bath ; and

underneath this, the regulus or remaining unburnt sulphides, containing in an ap-

proximately known state of concentration the more valuable metals derived from

the metalliferous substances operated upon. It was, however, necessary for the
practical application of the theory that sufficient heat should be developed during the
combustion of the iron, zinc, or other less valuable sulphides to keep the materials

molten during the operation. The temperatures of combustion of various sulphides,

calculated from known data, approached the maximum temperature attainable by

the combustion of coal, and this inspired a considerable amount of confidence. In
the case of iron pyrites these calculations are only rough approximations, as the
latent heat of sulphur vapour is not known. It was found that when thus
treating cupreous pyrites, the order in which the elements became oxidised was as

follows:

      1. Zinc and iron.

      2. Sulphur.

     3. Lead and copper.
     The above reactions find a parallel in the elimination of the metalloids from cast
iron by Bessemer's process, in which silicon and carbon and then phosphorus and
manganese are successively burnt out of the crude metal. Parallel analogies also
exist between the process of puddling and English copper smelting; where the
oxidation proceeds but slowly, and the necessary heat is obtained by the burning

of coal.

     The foregoing conclusions have been verified experimentally ; full particulars
thereof will be found in papers brought before the Society of Arts, February 12

and April 30 of this year.

    The spectroscopic observations taken by Dr. W. M. Watts during the course of
these experiments were valuable and interesting, and I am indebted to him for the

following information :

     In the experiments at Penistone two spectra were observed ; the first, that
given by the flame from the charging door of the cupola in which the pyrites was
melted ; the second, produced by the blast of air through the molten protosulphide
in the converter. The cupola-spectrum was shown by direct comparison with the
spectrum of a flame coloured by lead chlorate to be mainly due to oxide of lead,
but contained besides some few of the lines which appear to be proper to the
converter-spectrum. Analysis showed that the lead present in the ore was almost
entirely volatalised during the preliminary melting of the ore, the molten proto-
sulphide charged into the converter containing only 8- per cent. lead. The
converter flame gives a brilliant spectrum extending from the lithium line some-
what beyond the thallium line, which is usually present. Its most marked feature
is the presence of four bright red lines about equally spaced between the sodium
and lithium lines. Their wave lengths, as far as at present known, are approxi-
mately 5,999, 6,151, 6,320, and 6,466, besides a fainter line at 6,110. These lines

are not those of any known spectrum. The way in which the flame is obtained

suggests the theory that they are sulphur lines. When sulphur is burned in air or

oxygen the spectrum obtained is entirely continuous, and even if air be bubbled

through boiling sulphur no lines are obtained. Two spectra of sulphur obtained by

the electric discharge through a vacuum tube containing vapour of sulphur have
been described, but neither contains these four red lines. The spark with a
Leyden jar in a current of sulphur dioxide at the ordinary pressure yields a

Bpectrum (at present under investigation) apparently not previously described, in
which, however, the red lines are altogether different from those of the converter-
spectrum. The constancy with which these four red lines are associated together
seems to preclude the possibility of their being due to different substances, other-

wise the most refrangible fine might be due to lead. No lines of copper were

observed except in the fourth experiment, in which all the lines except those of

sodium disappeared about six minutes before the turn-down. When in this ex-

periment, towards the end of the blow, the subsulphide of copper began to burn, a

splendid emerald green flame suddenly appeared, and all the lines except those of
300 report-- 1879,

copper and sodium left the spectrum. During the last few minutes of the hlow the

mouth of the converter was dull and without flame, the sulphur and oxidisable

matter having been burnt out.

The principal cost of plant will be for the blast. Where sufficient water-power

is available, a plant capable of treating 15,000 tons of pyrites annually could be

erected at a cost of about 1,500/. Where, however, water-power is not available,

steam boilers will be requisite, and the additional cost for plant may be 500/., or

perhaps 1,000/.

With regard to the furnace, it is proposed to make the hearth, or rather crucible,

A·of siliceous, aluminous, or refractory carbonaceous material.   sufficiently large

proportion of siliceous flux in the furnace charge will greatly mitigate the action

of the resulting iron protoxide upon the silica of the lining. Aluminous shrunk

bricks may answer still better. It might even be found convenient to allow con-

siderable corrosion to the lining to take place, if the converting hearth is of such

form, and the materials are of such a nature, that it can be readily and economic-

ally renewed.

It may be also advantageous to run the regulus and slag, after the desired con-

centration has been effected, directly on to the hearth of a reverberatory furnace,

where they can be kept molten by external heat, and where a more perfect

separation of the one from the other may be effected. In such a furnace the final

oxidation of the rich regulus would probably be most conveniently effected,

although it is of course possible to produce metallic copper from the regulus by the

transmission of air currents in a specially constructed furnace.

Not only would antimony, lead, zinc, copper, nickel, silver, and other valuable

metals be extracted from the sulphides that contain them, but also from the incom-

bustible fluxing materials that are added to the charge, and the extraction of the

copper, and silver, and gold will probably be more complete than by any other

known process. In countries where cupreous siliceous schists and sandstones

abound, the use of these as siliceous fluxes would partially, if not wholly, compen-

sate for the loss of copper in the slag. Thus, by using 0*5 ton of such material,

containing 05 per cent, of copper for each ton of the sulphuretted ore, the whole

of the copper could be recovered from the latter, assuming the slag to contain even

as much as 02 per cent, of that metal.

The crude sulphur may be freed from the accompanying sulphide of arsenic by

boiling it with milk of lime, and from the metallic oxides and sulphides with which

it is contaminated by distillation ; or purification by bisulphide of carbon might be
resorted to. The sulphurous acid can be oxidised in chambers to sulphuric acid,

either with or without previous liquefaction.

This process, on account of its simplicity and economy, may reasonably be

expected, not only to take the place of the ordinary smelting, but also of many of
the wet processes now in use.

A5. Lecture Experiment in Illustration of the Hollivay Process of Smelting

                   Sulphide Ores. By Alfred H. Allen, F.C.S.

    By causing oxygen gas to bubble through molten antimony sulphide contained

in a V-shaped piece of combustion-tube, combustion takes place with such rise of
temperature as to soften the glass, while a sublimate is obtained of antimonious
oxide, and sulphurous acid gas is evolved. The sublimate is collected in an empty
globe, and the sulphurous acid is absorbed by passing it into a large vessel containing

lumps of wood-charcoal. At the conclusion of the experiment the contents of the
combustion-tube may be poured out, when a button of metallic antimony free

from sulphur is obtained.

    By passing oxygen over lumps of pyrites contained in a heated combustion-tube,
vivid combustion takes place, much free sulphur sublimes, and sulphurous acid gas

is obtained and absorbed as before described.

G. Lead Fume, with a Description of a Neiv Process of Fume Condensing.
                                       By A. French.

     1. The great loss of lead, and sometimes silver, by volatilisation induced Messrs.
Wilson and myself to investigate the physical nature and deportment of metallic
fumes as they exist in the furnace and in the flues.

   --2. The following is a classification of the various methods of condensing: :

    (a) Deposition by its own gravity in long flues, with or without the addition of

settling chambers.

     (b) Filtering through porous materials, such as coke, brushwood, or coarsely'
woven fabrics.

(c) The use of water, either in the form of steam or in spray projected across

the flue current.

(d) Processes based on the inverse of the preceding principle, viz., passing the

lead smoke under and through water in a more or less comminuted conditiou.

   We3. made experiments to prove the efficacy of each of those classes. The

microscopic aspect of the fume was taken in the nascent stage, and after it had

cooled and been exposed to friction in the flues. The fume taken from the interior

of the lead flame forms a continuous film on a glass plate, that taken after it has

assumed the condition of a white vapour, is granular, and consists chiefly of small

isolated round particles.

We4. studied the chemical character of lead fume with analyses, and the

influence of lead and zinc in promoting the volatilisation of silver.

A5. Cooling and friction hasten the deposition of fume in flues.       good arrange-

ment of flues is described.

   We6. give a description of the filtering methods, with results of some ex-

periments.

   We7. also state the results of a condenser worked at the Wanlockhead Lead

Works on the shower-bath principle. This apparatus was highly eulogised in the

descriptive catalogue of the Exhibition of 1851 ; since then the company have

doubled the quantity of lead saved, by supplementing a long flue, of one mile, to

the condenser.

We8. describe the fourth class of condensers. The requisite conditions to

obtain good condensation are to minutely subdivide the smoke current under

water, and at the same time use means to neutralise the surface tension of the

bubbles ; those conditions are obtained by passing the smoke through a series of

wire gauge diaphragms set close together and submerged in water to a depth of

seven inches.

    9. The paper concludes with a description of a new process and apparatus on

the foregoing principle, assays of smoke before entering and after leaving the con-
denser, and general results.

    2. On the Presence of Nitrogen in Steel. By A. H. Allen, F.G.S.

     The author made some preliminary experiments on this suhject in 1872, hut has
only recently obtained any definite results. The method adopted has been to
dissolve the steel in hydrochloric acid, by which means any combined nitrogen
may be presumed to be converted into ammonia. The solution obtained was then
distilled with excess of lime, and the distillate examined for ammonia by Nessler's
method. The employment of this extremely delicate test enabled the author to
operate on a much smaller quantity of steel than was employed by previous
investigators. Very special precautions were taken to obtain the hydrochloric acid
and other materials free from any trace of ammonia or nitrous compounds, and
the air was entirely expelled from the apparatus before commencing the operation.
The hydrogen evolved was freed from any traces of ammonia by passing it through
a tube filled with glass beads moistened with hydrochloric acid. It was proved by
blank experiments that no source of ammonia existed in the reagents or apparatus.

When absolutely pure materials were used, and every precaution taken to get rid

of the contained air and other sources of error, the addition of Nessler's solution
to the liquid obtained on distilling with lime caused a very marked yellowish-

brown colouration. On comparing the tint produced with that yielded by a dilute
solution of ammonium chloride of known strength, results were arrived at repre-

senting the proportions of nitrogen present in various typical specimens of steel.

As the results obtained from steels of different kinds varied greatly, it cannot be
assumed that there was a constant source of error in the mode of manipulation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

while as the same samples gave substantially concordant results on repeating the
experiment, the figures obtained were not the result of accident, but were true
expressions of the proportions of nitrogen present.

     In order to obtain ammonia in quantity sufficient for its recognition by other

--reactions than that with Nessler's test, the following plan was employed : Steam,

generated by boiling water in a flask, was passed over a considerable quantity of steel
borings contained in a combustion tube, which was bent beyond the furnace, and
prolonged so as to form the inner tube of a Liebig's condenser. To the further end

Aa tube filled with glass beads and furnished with a glass stopcock was attached.

rapid current of steam was driven through the apparatus for a considerable time
to expel every trace of air. On condensing the steam it was found free from any
trace of ammonia. The steel borings were then heated to redness by a com-
bustion furnace, and a rapid current of water passed through the condenser.
The condensed steam, when tested by Nessler's solution, was found to contain
abundance of ammonia, which did not diminish in amount till the borings were
almost entirely oxidised. On redistilling the condensed steam, a distillate was
obtained having a distinctly alkaline reaction to litmus paper, and on treating it
with hydrochloric acid and platinic chloride a sensible amount of yellow pre-
cipitate was obtained, having the characteristic crystalline form of ammonium
chloroplatinate. The amount found was larger than could possibly have been
produced had the whole of the nitrogen of any residual trace of air been converted
into ammonia. The author regards the results now recorded as preliminary merely,
and proposes to extend the research to various classes of steel and iron, and
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  303

especially to such specimens as have been found to possess anomalous characters.
Of these characters the evolution of ammonia from freshly fractured surfaces is

among the most striking.

3. Colour Tests for the Estimation of Sulphur and Phosphorus in Iron or

      S heel. By A. Vernon Harcourt, M.A., F.B.8., Lee's Reader in

        Chemistry at Christ Church, Oxford.

   A weighed portion of finely divided iron or steel is treated in a flask with diluted

sulphuric acid (previously boiled to expel air), with the addition of a lump of pure
zinc. The sulphur contained in the iron is evolved as sulphuretted hydrogen,'
which, passing into a foot-glass containing lead solution, colours the latter. The
phosphorus is evolved as phosphoretted hydrogen, which passes through the lead
solution into a second foot-glass containing a dilute solution of silver nitrate. The
flask is heated gradually to boiling, and then the depth of colour in the two foot-
glasses is compared with two sets of standards.

          4. Some Experiments with the Voltaic Induction Balance.

           By W. Chandler Roberts, F.B.S., Chemist of the Mint.

    The author stated that this instrument, which we owe to Professor Hughes,

the discoverer of the microphone, appeared to be one of no ordinary importance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

then described and exhibited Professor Hughes' instrument, showing the extreme
delicacy by which changes in the indueed current were indicated by the micro-
phone and telephone.

     The relative values of different metals, as indicated by the induction balance,
do not accord with the values usually accepted as representing the relative con-
ductivities of the respective metals ; and this being the case, Mr. Roberts had
ascertained what relation the indications given by alloys when under the influence

of the induced current bear to their electric conductivities.

     The experiments on a comprehensive aeries of alloys proved that, in the case of

alloys of certain metals, the induced current curves closely resembled those repre-
senting electric conductivity ; but that in certain other cases the induced current

revealed differences that had hitherto escaped observation. As an example, Mr.

Roberts alluded to the curve of the copper-tin alloys, in which there is a sudden
break between the points, representing two alloys, which only vary by a single
equivalent, or by 6-4 per cent, of copper. These two alloys are widely different in
colour, fracture, density, and structure, and the induction balance at once afforded
evidence of a marked difference not shown in Matthiessen's curve of electric

conductivity.

    It is known that certain metals when alloyed undergo a molecular change, and
that an allotropic condition may in some cases be induced by alloying a metal with
a small quantity of another, facts which will doubtless receive careful examination
from those who are pointing to the non-elementary character of certain metals.

     Mr. Roberts then referred to the question of applying the induction balance to
the assay of metals. In the case of gold-silver alloys the instrument will show

the presence of less than 2 grains of gold in the pound of silver. On the other

hand, the silver-copper alloys used for coinage are situated at the flat portion of the

curve, so that it is impossible to detect even considerable differences in their com-
position, and these alloys, which are very peculiar to their nature, appear to be
greatly affected by annealing. More hopeful results were obtained with the gold-
copper alloys, and Mr. Roberts demonstrated a difference of 1 per cent, in the
standard of two gold discs, which, though far short of the existing method of
assay in delicacy, appeared to afford grounds for the belief that very accurate

results will ultimately be obtained.

A5. Historical Sketch of the various Vapour Density Methods.

                      By James T. Brown, F.G.S.

     Although Southern in 1803 made some very careful experiments to determine
how much water was required to furnish one cubic foot of steam at various pres-
sures, still the foundation of vapour-density methods was laid by Gay-Lussac.
He, in 1811, started on the correct basis of accurate work when he heated a
weighed quantity of substance over mercury in a graduated vessel. In 1822,
Oagniard de la Tour determined the combined effects of heat and pressure on
certain volatile liquids, but as his results were on the question of maximum vapour-
densitv, they hardly enter the domain of the present sketch. In the same year,
Despretz, who gave no drawing, and only a very imperfect description of his appa-
ratus, published a method in which he used a 9-litre exhausted globe, and made

his determinations at atmospheric temperatures, employing only a small quantity of
substance. In 1826, Dumas, wishing to operate on substances which attack mer-
cury, worked out and published his well-known method, in which the volume is
definite, but the amount of substance required to fill that volume with vapour has

to be subsequently determined.

In 1833, Mitscherlich proposed using tubes, sealed at one end, and drawn to

a neck at the other, instead of bulbs, and gave details and drawings of the appa-

     heating    them                             but Dumas,  two years later,  objected to the proposed
                                              ;
-- Weratusfor

alteration in his method, for he wrote : '                   must then leave to this operation

all its simplicity to make it essentially practical, and such, in fact, that with an

ordinary cast-iron pot, and some pieces of iron wire, we can perform it. This is

what I have done from the first, and what I persist in doing, my aim never having

been to make a piece of apparatus for the cupboard of the physicist, but to give

chemists a simple and eminently practical, and yet exact process. After all they

are the only ones to be considered.' Deville and Troost, however, in 1860, in

referring to that same apparatus, called it, 'La m^thode si elegante de M.

Mitscherlich.'

     Bineau, in 1838, published an elaborate paper, but, unfortunately, without any

--drawings, for when we read the following paragraph ' The bodies on which I

have worked have been volatilised, sometimes by the aid of heat, by following the

process of Dumas or that of Gay-Lussac, sometimes without elevation of tempera-
ture, by working in the barometric vacuum, or by allowing the vaporisation to

--take place in dry air or hydrogen ' we cannot but feel that an enormous amount

of valuable work has been lost for want of details. In 1844, we find Oahours, as
well as Bineau, at work at the same subject. In 1846, the latter repeated the

experiments of Despretz with slight modifications, but called attention to the fact

that the result was seriously affected by very small errors in reading off the mer-

curial column.

     In 1849, Regnault used an apparatus very similar to that of Mitscherlich, but
arranged the tube supports so that the two could be withdrawn simultaneously
he also dispensed with sealing the tube containing air, by providing it with a stop-

cock. Bineau, in 1859, in order to operate at high temperatures, coated the glass

tubes with clay, and heated them in a sand-bath.
     Regnault, in 1861, to obtain the same result, used iron tubes, and to ensure

uniformity of temperature, heated them in a cast-iron tube, which was made to
revolve over gas-burners. The tube which served as air-thermometer, was fur-

nished with a stop-cock, but that containing the substance only terminated in a

small aperture, and was not closed, as a sufficient quantity was introduced before

the heating to allow it to be taken for granted that during the experiment there

was no residual air. Another method of Regnault's was to have two iron bottles, of
as nearly as possible the same size, cast in one piece. In one of these the substance
was placed, and in the other a small quantity of mercury. The necks were then
partially closed by loose stoppers, and the system was heated in a muffle. After
heating, it was withdrawn, and allowed to cool, and the quantities remaining in

the bottles were determined by suitable means.

    Grabowski, in 1866, did much to shorten the Dumas calculation, while he
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  305

 allowed the method to retain all its accuracy and simplicity, when he proposed to
 heat a bulb containing air in the same bath, and of the same size, as that con-
 taining the substance. After being heated, the two bulbs were then sealed at the
 same temperature. Bunsen, in 1867, employed an air-bath, similar in principle to
 those of Mitscherlich and Regnault, but heated it by a very elaborate arrano-e-

nient of gas burners. He also simplified the calculation by taking care that all the
tubes were of exactly the same weight and same size. He did not seal the tubes,

 but closed them by glass caps, lined with india-rubber and fitted with glass
 plugs. Dumas, in cases where the vapour rendered the outlet difficult to seal,
 used globes fitted with ground stoppers.

     For the Dumas process at high temperatures, Deville and Troost, in 1860,
 recommended heating the bulb in a specially constructed furnace, in the vapours

 of substances having high but definite boiling-points, such as mercury, sulphur,
 zinc, or cadmium. For temperatures above the boiling-point of sulphur, they used
porcelain globes. For temperatures up to that point, the smaller and more com-
pact apparatus devised by Greville Williams answers admirably.

       Roscoe, last year, in determining the vapour-densities of the chlorides of lead
and thallium, used porcelain globes of 300 c.c. capacity, heated in a muffle, but

determined the temperature by the method of specific heat, a large piece of
platinum being employed for the purpose, and checked the result by the simul-

 taneous determination of the vapour density of mercury.

      For working at a reduced pressure, Regnault proposed partially exhausting
the bulb by means of an air-pump during the experiment ; when the desired tem-
perature was reached, it was sealed off at a point where the neck had been nar-
rowed to a convenient size. In 1876, Habermann gave a complete diagram of the

apparatus, replacing the air-pump by a Bunsen pump ; but although he made no
alteration in the method, still it was referred to by Sommaruga as Habermann's.

     Various experiments had been performed on vapours mixed with air, but the
main point in Playfair and Wanklyn's method (1861) consisted in stopping the

supply of vapour before the bath in which the bulb was being heated had attained

its maximum temperature.

     Natanson, in 1855, in order to use the Gay-Lussac method up to a temperature

of 300°, heated the upper part of the tube by means *of charcoal in a cylindrical
furnace, and determined the temperature by thermometers suspended in the air-

space between the graduated tube and the inner tube of the heating apparatus. In

correcting for the tension of mercury-vapour he used Avogadro's tables.

     Greville Williams, in 1857, wishing to make some determinations at varying

--pressures, devised the following method : The graduated tube is, after it has been

filled and the bulb has been inserted, screwed by means of a nipple cemented to
the bottom into an orifice in the top of a small metallic cistern into a second
orifice in which a long open glass tube is fitted. Into this tube mercury is poured

until the required pressure is obtained. To reduce the pressure the excess of
mercury is allowed to escape by a tap in the side of the cistern. The. whole is

heated in a water- or oil-bath.

     In Regnault's apparatus for the same purpose, the two tubes are fastened to

the bottom of the water-bath and are connected by a T piece, which is closed by a

three-way cock of special construction.
   For determinations up to 150° Greville Williams's compact modification consists

in replacing the large vessel of mercury, and the open glass cylinder by a cylinder

closed and rounded at the lower extremity, so as to resemble a large test-tube.
This is then filled to a depth of 50-60 m. m. with mercury, and above that with
water or oil to a convenient height. The graduated tube is filled and the bidb

inserted over the mercurial trough ; it is then immersed' in the large tube by
means of a rod having at the end a small cup containing mercury. The large tube

may be supported on wire gauze and heated by a Bunsen burner, or may be

placed in a shallow oil-bath.

     Schiff, in 1862, proposed steadying and manipulating the graduated tube by
means of a loaded handle, which was secured to its upper extremity by spring clips.

    Grabowski, in 1866, replaced the charcoal 'furnace of Natanson by a very much

neater air-bath heated by gas, but the chief merit in his method is that a tube
containing air is heated by the side of that containing the substance. As soon as

the substance is all converted into vapour, air is passed up into the second tube
until it occupies as nearly as possible the same volume as the vapour. After the
operation the air is measured at atmospheric pressure and temperature.

     Croullebois, in 1874, reverted to Bineau's method of using a large globe with a

long tube, but took the precaution to heat the upper portion in a water-bath.
Deville however, criticised his method rather severely, and pointed out that it was

an unwieldy apparatus to manipulate.
     In 1868, Hofmann, in modifying the Gay-Lussac method, while he adopted the

lono- tube which had been previously used by Bineau, Playfair and Wanklyn, and

Grabowski, introduced such an important alteration into the apparatus that it is

not spoken of as his modification but as his method. Instead of heating the

substance-tube by a water-, oil-, or air-bath, he simply enclosed it in a, slightly

larger mantle tube, and passed the vapour of a liquid of definite boiling-point

through the intervening space, selecting the liquid according to the temperature

required. By this means he not only rendered the apparatus much more compact,

but he maintained a steady temperature with the greatest ease. Wichelhaus,

in 1870, anxious to avoid the uncertainty introduced by the doubt as to the
temperature of the column of mercury between the bottom of the outer tube and

the trough, dispensed with the latter by fixing to the lower extremity of the

substance-tube an inverted siphon containing mercury. Then, by lengthening and

suitably enlarging the lower extremity of the outer tube, the whole of the inner one

can be surrounded by vapour.

    Grabowski, in 1875, in order to obtain a high temperature, employed the vapour

of  naphthalene as the heating medium in using  Hofmann's apparatus                                                                                                    but Engler,
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

in the following year, finding that the stoppage of the tubes from the solidification

--of the condensed hydrocarbon was troublesome, proposed to obviate the difficulty

in the following manner : He fixed to the lower end of the outer tube a metal

socket provided with a short side-tube similar to those used for heating funnels.

Then, by boiling the heating medium in this tube and allowing the vapour to

cohobate in the space between the two glass tubes, he dispensed with all the

arrangement of flask, tubes, and condenser.

    Hofmann at the same time made several modifications in his apparatus :

    (1.) He proposed heating the whole length of the inner tube by making the

outer one long enough to enter the mercury in the trough, and provided for the

escape of the condensed liquid and excess of steam by having a small side-tube

affixed a short distance above the level of the mercury.

   --(2.) Finding that graduated tubes were very liable to crack, he proposed using

plain ones in the following manner : In the bottom of the mercurial trough he

placed a piece of sheet india-rubber attached to an iron plate and provided with a

groove on its upper surface ; the iron plate was furnished with a handle. During

the heating the inner tube stood over the groove to allow of the escape of the

mercury. When the level became stationary, communication with the mercury in

the trough was cut oif by shifting the india-rubber disc until the inner tube rested on

the flat surface. The height of the column in the inner tube was then noted by
means of a cathetometer ; the outer tube was then removed, and a gummed label

attached to the inner one to indicate the mercury level. After cooling, the volume

of the vapour is determined from direct measurement.

     (3.) In order to avoid the cracking of the tubes in cases where liquids of high
boiling-point were used, he proposed connecting the lower end of the outer tube

with the inner one by a cork, through which two tubes leading to the flask or

boiler passed. One of them led below the liquid, while the other, which was pro-

vided with a stop-cock, reached only just below the cork. If this stop-cock be

closed while the liquid is being heated a portion of it is forced up the space between

the two glass tubes, and thus the mercurial column is heated more gradually.

When the liquid reaches the boiling point the stop-cock is opened and the circula-

tion of the steam proceeds as usual. The upper part of the outer tube must be

sufficiently elongated or provided with a small tube leading to a condenser.

     Briihl proposed working the Hofniaiin method at a very low pressure by

employing a tube 1*6 metres long with only a small quantity of substance, and
was therefore able to make determinations at temperatures far below its boilin*

point. He also made the following suggestions :

     1. In order to eliminate the troublesome element of the tension of mercury-
vapour (without using two tubes, as Grabowski did), heat the column to the

required temperature, note its height, then allow it to cool ; introduce the substance,

and heat again to the same temperature till the height is constant. To ensure

uniformity of level in the bath keep it full to overflowing.

      2. Before the first reading of the mercurial column, a small piece of thin

glass is passed up to liberate any air that maybe contained in the mercury.

     3. To make a mark on the tube a little above the vacuum mercury level, and
then only to calibrate about 150 m.m. down from that point ; then, to find the
total volume, add the variable volume below the mark to the fixed volume above

the mark.

Muir and Suguira, in 1877, finding that sometimes the weight of the inner tube

caused the groove in the india-rubber disc to so far close as to prevent the escape

of the mercury while heating the substance, used a plain india-rubber disc, which

was fastened to the bottom of the trough, a disc of cork intervening. Oom-

munication between the mercury in the tube and that in the trough was maintained

Aby means of a short piece of glass tubing bent at right angles.         second tube,

long enough to stand slightly above the level of the mercury iu the trough, served

to carry off from the space between the two tubes the condensed liquid and
excess of vapour. They adopted Hofmann's original method of passing the steam

in at the top of the outer tube, but used a small tube passing through a perforated

cork in preference to one fused to the end.

     Briihl has this year proved, by most carefully conducted experiments, that the
Hofmann method cannot be used above 220°, owing to the great and rapidly

increasing vapour-tension of mercury; but has omitted the grave objection to

his own method. Playfair and Wanklyn called attention in 1861 to the fact that

Bineau, in 1846, pointed out that in vapour-density methods, at very reduced

pressures, slight errors in the readings of the mercurial level introduce very serious

errors into the result.

     In the Overflow methods, which are in reality modifications of the Gay-Lussac,
seeing that they are performed with known weights of substance, the first name

is Hofmann, who in 1860 gave a very meagre description of his apparatus, when

Uhe wrote that he used an tube heated in a paraffin bath, and estimated the

volume of the vapour by the mercury expelled. Werthein, in 1862-64, in his

papers on Ooniin, gave full details of his method, in which he used two tubes

suspended side by side in a flask.

Watts, in 1867, employed a globe with a ground neck, into which an outlet

tube, reaching nearly to the bottom of the globe was accurately fitted. The globe

being filled with mercury, and the substance introduced, the quantity of mercury

expelled on heating served as a basis for calculating the volume occupied by the

vapour. Victor Meyer, in 1876, introduced two very important alterations, he

avoided the vapour-tension of mercury by using fusible metal, and placed the

outlet at the bottom of the bidb. His experiments at that time were all made

in the vapour of boiling sulphur, but Graebe, last year, wishing to employ a higher

temperature, used phosphorus pentasulphide, which boils at 530°.

Frerichs, in 1876, used mercury in an apparatus similar in principle to that of

Watts, but employed an inverted flask, and brought the exit-tube, which was

furnished with an inverted siphon, through a suitable outlet in the bottom of the

bath.

Goldschmiedt and Oiamician, in 1877, used mercury with the simpler bulb of

Victor Meyer, but added a small side-tube to the outlet, so that the mercury

expelled could be weighed from time to time during the heating. Victor Meyer,

in the same year, modified the shape of the bulb, but heated it in a tube similar to

that employed by Greville Williams in the Gay-Lussac determinations, but of

sufficient length for the upper part of the tube to serve as condenser.

Pfaundler's method, of which a preliminary notice appeared in 1870, but

which was not brought prominently forward till this year, is based on the increased

tension of the air in an elongated bulb produced by heating after the introduction

of the substance, as compared with a similar determination of air in a bulb of the
Asame size.
                very short description appeared in 1874 of a method devised by

Dulong, which is based on the same principle.

    Last year Hofmann proposed two methods ; in one of these, he heated the

Uweighed substance over mercury in the closed limb of an tube, and marked the

level of the mercury in the open limb by sliding a pointed tube through a loosely-

fitting perforated cork until it touched the surface. When the apparatus was cool,

the volume of the vapour was calculated from the weight of mercury required to
restore the level to that same point. The other consisted in introducing into a

tube a small but weighed quantity of substance, then exhausting it, and sealing it,

and heating in a jacketed tube. At the required temperature, the point of the

glass tube is opened to allow air to enter, and then at once sealed again. After

cooling, the point is opened under mercury or water, and the volume occupied by

the vapour is measured.

In Meyer's method, which is so recent and well known as not to require any

explanation, the principle is that of Pfaundler's, but by having the neck elongated,

and the outlet as a side-tube, the substance is introduced after the bulb is heated

to the required temperature, and by allowing the air expelled by the vapour free

egress into a graduated tube, it can be measured under atmospheric conditions.

It is, therefore, so simple that the operation only requires a very short time from

first to last.

In this sketch I have purposely kept off the very enticing ground of formula,

as they, of themselves, open up so wide a field that they could not be dove-tailed

into the history of the subject, which from any point of view is interesting.

In the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for last May, Mr. Cooper and myself described

an acid to which we gave the name isocyanopropionic acid.

The acid had been prepared by the oxidation of wool by means of perman-

N0ganate
of  potash         and          caustic                                 potash,  and     had  the   formula  C,H           3.

We have acted upon the acid by means of caustic potash at 200° 0., and

thereby obtained ethylamine and oxalate of potash, thus :

The nodule to which this paper refers was discovered at Kinghorn-ness during

the excavations rendered necessary by the fortifications at present being raised for

the defence of the Firth of Forth.

The material was enclosed in a nest or nodule, and was found at a depth of

15 feet from the surface of the ground and embedded 5 feet in hard trap rock.

    The rock in which the nodule was obtained was sound, no crack or fissure
being observable for several feet round the nest. At a point some distance below

the nodule the section shows a series of small veins or fissures running through

the rock in various directions and averaging J of an inch in breadth. The analysis

of this rock gave the following results calculated to percentages.

application of heat gave the first distillate, which was of a gray colour, somewhat

mobile, and had a disagreeable odour. The second distillate was black in colour,

fully more mobile than the first distillate, and also possessed a most disagreeable

odour. Tbe third portion was more mobile than the second, had a yellow colour,

and a marked paraffin odour. The fourth distillate was obtained after raising the

heat, had a yellow-red colour, was liquid whilst hot, but turned solid on cooling,

and had also a paraffin odour. The uncondensable gaseous matter readily burned

on the application of a white light, gave a pale non-luminous flame, and possessed

the retort added to the amount of uncondensable gas gives 8-989 per cent., and on

Hcalculating the uncondensable gas into ethylene or olefiantgas (C 2 4 ), the result ob-

tained is 8-88G, or nearly identical. These results go far to show that the bituminous-
Hlike matter of the nodule consists of a member or members of the olefine (02 4)
--series of organic compounds a point which is further strengthened by the fact that

the carbon and hydrogen in the original substance are contained therein in almost

exactly the necessary proportions to form an olefine.

     It is probable that the source of the contents of the nodule lies in one of the

coal or shale beds abounding in the district, and that a low internal heat has dis-

tilled the material from its parent stratum. That the heat was low, or certainly not

above a cherry-red, is certain, else the olefine would have been split up into a

member of the methane or CHj group of organic substances, accompanied by a

deposition of free carbon.

11. On Some Curious Concretion Balls derived from a Colliery Mineral
                        Water. By Thomas Andrews, F.C.S.

     The water on which these observations were made was collected from the
' sump ' of the Wortley Silkstone Colliery, a small pit situated near the ' Bassett ' or
' outcrop ' of the great Silkstone seam of coal ; the samples being obtained during
typical dry and rainy seasons. The water had percolated from the surface a
distance of 35 yards, through strata, as indicated on the accompanying table.

     The bottom layer in which the water lodged was the Silkstone seam of coal,
here some 5 feet in thickness.

     One noticeable feature of this water is, that it always gives an acid reaction
with blue litmus paper.

     Several analyses of this water made at various times indicate that the chief

--mineral constituents of the water are, iron calcium, magnesium, in the form of

sulphates.

This water when heated quickly throws down a copious ochreous deposit. The

deposit found in the engine boilers after having used the water in them for steam

purposes was of the composition given below.

The boiler residue from which this sample was taken, consisted of an in-

crustation about one inch thick, which had adhered to the bottom of the boiler.

The incrustation was of a light reddish yellow colour in the bulk, it was very

hard and tough, and not easily broken in pieces.

    The iron work in connection with this colliery engine and boilers, in any way

exposed to the action of either the acid water itself, or the steam generated from it,

becomes corroded and partially dissolved. The most effectual remedy against this

mycorrosive action and deposit, is that described in  letter to the Chemical News,

June 15, 1877.

     Some curious balls of mineral matter are occasionally found in the feed tank of
the colliery boilers, which are supplied with this water. The water is pumped up
 from the engine pond into a cylindrical feed tank, and is there heated by the

exhaust steam from the engine playing on its surface (not blowing through it).
The water in this feed tank has an average temperature of 164° F.

      It sometimes happens that during the short space of even two or three weeks,
great numbers of these balls are formed, varying in size from about three and a half
inches in diameter to five-eighths of an inch diameter, and in weight from about
one and a half pound to a quarter of an ounce.

     The author has many of these in his possession. They are perfectly hard and
compact when taken from the tank, and are no doubt formed from the deposit
thrown down when the mineral water is heated.

     The action of steam playing on the surface of the water probably causes circular
eddies, and when a nucleus has thus once been formed, it is easy to conceive of the
gradual formation and consolidation of these balls.

     The author suggests that the conditions of formation of natural nodules of iron
ore, pyrolusite, &c, may be similar to those observed by him in the foregoing cases.

     The following is the analysis of the balls formed in the feed tank, from which

it will be seen that they are quite different in composition to the residue deposited
in the boilers, owing probably to the difference in the temperature between the feed
tank and the boiler.

matter in the water should have increased owir.g simply to this increase in quantity

is not at first sight very clear.

    It may be possible that the largely increased number, area and length of air-
ways has a tendency to expose the water for a longer time to oxidising influences,

and thus add to the percentage of sulphates, and this increased facility for oxidation
no doubt also induces more rapid solution of the strata as the water slowly permeates

through it.

    The author hopes these few imperfect observations may not prove altogether
uninteresting to those who take pleasure in the study of mineral waters.

     The following Papers were read :

          1. On some points in connection with Agricultural Chemistry.
                              By Dr. J. H. Gilbert, F.B.S.

     Dr. Gilbert stated that in the experiments of Mr. Lawes and himself, conducted
on the farm of Mr. Lawes, at Rothamsted, Herts, wheat had now been grown for
thirty-six years in succession on the same land ; barley for twenty-eight years in
succession, oats for nine years, root crops for more than thirty years, beans for more
than thirty years, and they had experimented on the mixed herbage of grass land
for twenty-four years. They found minor distinctions in the manurial requirements
of different plants of the same natural family, but very great distinctions in the
requirements of plants of different natural families. The gramineous crops are very
low in their percentage of nitrogen, and yield but a small quantity of it per acre.
Yet nitrogenous manures are very effective when applied to such crops. Legumi-
nous crops, on the other hand, are very high in their percentage of nitrogen, and
yield a large amount of it per acre. Yet nitrogenous manures are of little avail to
these plants, and potass manure is especially effective. The difference in the manure
requirements of plants of other natural families was also pointed out. Much more
complicated, however, was the problem when experiments were made upon the
mixed herbage of grass land, where they might have fifty or more species growing
in association, representing perhaps twenty natural families. It was at once found
that the manures which most favoured gramineous crops separately grown on arable
land brought forward the gramineous plants of the mixed herbage. Those, on the
other hand, which favoured the leguminosae, grown separately, on arable land,
brought forward the legiuninosse in the mixed herbage. Somewhat similar results
occurred with the plants of other natural families. Hence, the twenty different plots
in those experiments soon showed as many distinct floras. Tables were exhibited
illustrating the variation in the number of species, their percentage by weight, and
the amounts which the different natural families yielded per acre. With the great

difference, not only in the flora, but also in the character of development of the

plants, there was the greatest possible difference in the chemical composition. The
dry matter of the mixed herbage contained in some cases 1£ time as much nitrogen
as in others. The percentage of potass in the produce varied as one to two, and
the amount of potass yielded per acre as one to five in the different experiments
and there were considerable differences among the other constituents. The produce
of the respective natural families possessed its own normal composition within certain
limits. Yet this was varied immensely according to the conditions supplied, and

the character of the produce grown. Thus, the ash of the gramineous produce
showed a variation in the percentage of potass of from about 24 to about 40 ; the
ash of the leguminous produce from 12 to 33 ; and that of the miscellaneous pro-

duce from 17 to 37. One point of especial interest was the difference in the
amount of nitrogen yielded by the plants of the different natural families. It was
                                                                                             ;

assumed by some that some plants assimilated the free nitrogen of the atmo-

sphere                            but  the  authors  considered  that  the  balance of  the  direct experimental
                               ;

evidence on the point was decidedly against such a supposition ; and so far as their

existing evidence went they considered it much more probable that the different

plants only took up combined nitrogen, and chiefly from the soil. They showed

by reference to their experiments that in the growth of wheat or barley for many

years in succession on the same land without nitrogenous manure the annual yield

of nitrogen in the crop gradually diminished. With this they found a diminution

in the percentage of nitrogen in the soil. In the case of the root crops, where the

diminution in the annual yield of nitrogen was even greater than in the case of the

cereals, the diminution in the percentage of the nitrogen in the soil was also greater.

In the case of beans there was also a diminution in the yield of nitrogen in the

crop, but still much more was yielded over the later period than in either wheat

or barley. In this case there was not found a marked reduction of nitrogen in

the surface soil. In the case of the mixed herbage experiments very much more

nitrogen was yielded by the application of potass manure ; and here they found a

great reduction in the percentage of nitrogen in the soil. In the case of clover

grown for many years in garden soil, the percentage of nitrogen in the soil was

also very largely reduced. Part of this reduction might be due to other causes

but the indication was that the leguminosae had derived their nitrogen from the

soil. Admitting that the sources of the whole of the nitrogen of vegetation were

not conclusively made out, they nevertheless considered that the existing evidence

was against the idea of the assimilation of free nitrogen by plants, and in favour of

the opinion that the nitrogen was mainly, if not entirely, derived through the

medium of the soil.

                     2. The Bare Metals of the Yttrium Group.

                      By T. S. Humpidge, Ph.D., B.Sc. {Bond.)

     This paper consisted of a few remarks on some experiments with these metals,
instigated for the purpose of finding some better method of separation of the metals,
and of separating the metals themselves to determine their specific heats. The
main objects of the investigation produced only negative results.

     The material employed for the preparation of the earth was gadolinite, and the
method of extraction was the usual one. The earths themselves were separated by
Bunsen's well-known method with the basic nitrates ; no better means of separa-
tion could be found. Three earths were first obtained, viz., yttria, terbia, and
erbia, with their usual properties. Afterwards Marignac's ' ytterbia ' was looked
for in the supposed pure erbia, and the existence of this new earth confirmed. The

Xearths ' ' of Soret, ' phillipia,' and ' decipia ' of Delafontaine in all probability do

not exist ; though at present the evidence at our disposal is too meagre for any de-

cisive opinion to be formed.

     The reduction of the fused chlorides by an electric current was attempted, but
numerous experiments only yielded the metals in the shape of a powder of small

metallic scales; their specific heats could not therefore be determined. As no

volatile compound of these metals is known, the only other method for determining
their atomic weights was by isomorphism. Rammelsberg had stated several years
ago that the sulphates of cadmium, didymium, and yttrium are isomorphous, whence
he drew the inference that the two latter metals (or groups of metals) are dyads,
and their oxides therefore monoxides. This was proved to be incorrect by Hilde-
brandt's experiments with the didymium group of metals, by which he found that
their specific heats were such that the atomic weights assigned to them by
Eammelsberg must be increased by half as much again, so that their oxides would
become sesquioxides. Kopp has lately shown, and his experiments have been con-
firmed by the author, that the isomorphism which Rammelsberg imagined to exist
between the cadmium, didymium, and yttrium salts is forced and unnatural, and,
further, that cadmium sulphate and didymium sulphate, or cadmium sulphate and
yttrium sidphate do not crystallise regularly together ; while, on the other hand,
didymium sulphate and yttrium sulphate do so. Yttrium and the other metals of
                                                                                                                    ;

its group are, therefore, isomorphous with didymiurn and not with cadmium, whence
it follows that the oxides of this group of metals are sesquioxides. The numerous
compounds of the yttrium metals prepared by M. Oleve are more simply formulated
on this assumption than on any other.

     The author exhibited a few specimens connected with this investigation.

6. An account of some Recent Experiments on Supersaturated Solutions.
                                By John M. Thomson.

In this paper the author alluded to his experiments communicated to the Chemical

Society, in which he shows that perfectly isomorphous substances, that is, bodies

possessing the same chemical constitution and crystalline form, are capable of ex-

citing crystallisation in supersaturated solutions of each other. Instances were

given of the different classes of salts examined, such as the sulphates of the Mag-

nesium group possessing               the  general  form     M''S0              7H         upon each other.         Experi-
                                                                             4          2

ments were also made on other isomorphous groups, such as the group of Alums,

HPOand the                                                                                 12H.          N«         HAs0 .
        phosphates and                arseniates  of  sodium  (Na                                2  and          2                     4
                                                                        2                  t
H12 20). The author then alluded to experiments on mixtures of isomorphous and

non-isomorphous bodies with each other, pointing out that a considerable separation

between non-isomorphous bodies, when mixed, may be brought about ; but that

this separation could not be carried out with isomorphous substances.

Mr. Thomson then described some new experiments upon the action of the dif-

ferent constituents upon supersaturated solutions of compoimd salts, such as the

action of potassium sulphate on an alum solution, the action of mercury iodide or

potassium iodide on the double iodide of mercury and potassium, the action of mer-

cury chloride or ammonium chloride on the double chloride of mercury and ammo-

nium, and finally the action of normal tartrate of potash or soda on a solution of the

compound salt, viz., rochelle salt. From these experiments it seems that in the case

of the double chlorides and iodides mentioned the different constituents behave as

active nuclei in exciting the crystallisation of the compound salts ; but that in the

cases of the alum and rochelle salt solutions, the different component salts were

not able to excite the crystallisation of the double salts. Mr. Thomson proposes

to extend these experiments, if possible, in the direction of an examination into

the condition of compound and double salts when in solution.

1. Carefully distilled sodium condensed in a capillary tube, and placed in the

retort, gives 20 volumes of hydrogen.

2. Phosphorus carefully dried gives 70 volumes of gas, chiefly hydrogen, which,

PHhowever, is not  3 , although it gives some of the lines of phosphorus. It is not

                              By Alfred H. Allen.

     The application of the commercial names "' benzoline ' and ' benzine ' to the
more volatile portion of petroleum has led to great confusion between petroleum
spirit and coal-tar naphtha, the most characteristic constituent of which is the

hydrocarbon benzene or benzol.
     Although presenting close general resemblances, the following characteristic

differences exist between petroleum spirit and coal-tar naphtha. All the tests
given have been carefully verified by the author on representative samples of
petroleum spirit and coal-tar benzol.

The greater number of the above tests are valueless when applied to mixtures

of petroleum and coal-tar naphthas, but No. 10 is capable of giving quantitative

results if the treatment with nitric acid be conducted in a small flask and an

inverted condenser attached, to prevent loss of vapours. When action has nearly

ceased, if the liquid be poured into a narrow graduated tube, the measure of the

upper layer indicates with approximate accuracy the amount of petroleum spirit

present. If the proportion of benzene is considerable, the nitrobenzene produced

may not remain completely dissolved in the nitric acid, in which case it rises and

forms a layer of a dark brown colour below the stratum of petroleum spirit. Nitro-

benzene and petroleum spirit are readily miscible in the absence of nitric acid, but

agitation with strong nitric acid dissolves out the nitrobenzene, a portion of which

may rise and form an intermediate layer as above described.

By fractional distillation, the author found that the proportion of heptane,
HC
     7  16, present in commercial benzoline probably equalled, or even exceeded, that

of all the other constituents.

9. On the Illuminative Value of a Mixture of Hydrogen with some Hydro-
      carbons. By A. Yeknon Haecourt, M.A., F.B.S., Lee's Reader in

        Chemistry at Christ Church, Oxford.

     The author has determined the proportions in which pentane and hydrogen
must be mixed to form a gas which, burnt at the rate of 5 cubic feet an hour at

a standard argand burner, gives the light of 16 candles. He has also made a

comparative experiment with benzene.

     The experiments were made by passing hydrogen from a gasholder into a

cylindrical glass about an inch wide, containing the volatile hydrocarbon, and thence

though a meter to the burner. By regulating the temperature of the liquid, and

the distance between the mouth of the tube through which the hydrogen entered
and the surface of the liquid, the light of the gas flame upon the disk of the photo-
meter could be kept nearly equal to that of the candles used for comparison when
the gas was passing through a meter at 5 cubic feet an hour.

     Each experiment lasted one hour, at the end of which the weight of pentane
which had evaporated was ascertained, and the weight of spermaceti consumed by

the two candles. An observation of the illuminating power of the gas was made

every minute, and the rate of evaporation adjusted so as to keep the illuminating
power as nearly as possible equal to that of 16 candles.

     The following results were obtained :

the illuminative value of the two hydrocarbons :

length of 15-inch pipes that I have used has been only 15 feet, and in this short
length a plentiful stream of water can he changed into acid, 24° Twaddel, when
the vitriol has been freshly run on the salt. Of course where the charge has boiled

down this cannot be maintained with such a short length of tube, hence, up to the
present, strong acid has been delivered down the tube by a pump 1 introduced to
the trade about two years ago. Ultimately, I trust, no acid pump will be needed
in connection with the condenser, but the gas cooled and the acid made from

water alone.

   A vertical range of 12 inch pipes filled with coke and supplied with water is

provided to make away with the remains of the gas ; this may be all put under

pressure by narrowing the exit. There is reason to believe that a very short range

will eventually be required here, even if one be needed at all.
     The large powers of cooling and acid making shown by 15 feet of piping

chequered with tiles, show that further development may be expected in this
direction. If 15 feet can do so much, what of 30 or 50 feet ? In this way I hope

to dispense with acid pumping entirely.
     The highest test taken at the exit pipe showed an escape of l -2 grains per

cubic foot, and the lowest test - 09 grain per cubic foot. This on a 12 inch

pipe, with a speed too slow to be found in the usual fashion, would yield merely

a fractional percentage on the salt used, or a figure in the third place of decimals

if reckoned on a cubic foot taken from a moderate sized chimney with 6 or 8
feet of speed a second. These satisfactory results obtained at the outset are most

encouraging, and lead me to hope that ultimately the very smell of the acid vapour
may be quenched.

     If this method prove capable of making vitriol, it will effect changes of an

importance difficult to estimate.

     The old plan stands aside, as it were, provides long lanes of piping in which
the gas may spread its giant bulk and wander on, until weary with gradual
cold, it slowly submits to the liquid form. The new plan stands directly in front

of it, quenches its fire ere it has gone six yards, draws it swiftly on, and crushes it
between cool surfaces of liquor until its power to harm has passed away.

1. Notes on a Sample of Fuller's Earth, found in a Fullouica recently

            excavated at Pompeii. By William Thomson, F.R.S.E.

     In visiting the ancient city of Pompeii in April last, I observed in one of the
Fullomca establishments a large square tank set in the ground, filled with a white,
soft substance, which was soapy to the touch, and which was pointed out to us as
the soap of the ancient inhabitants. I took a sample of the substance with a view
of making a chemical examination of it.

  ( This substance is named by the Italians ' Terra Fullouica,' and besides beinur

found in the dyers' and washers' quarter of the city, it has been discovered fre-
quently in the ordinary houses which have been excavated.

    Among the literature of chemistry I searched for but failed to find any

mention of this Fuller's earth or its composition, but through the kindness of

Signor Felice Niccoline, Director of the National Museum of Naples, I obtained a

pamphlet written by Professor de Luca, entitled, ' Chemical Researches on " Terra
Fullonica," found in Pompeii, April 13, 1878.'

      In this he gives the general chemical peculiarities of the clay, such as its being

--phates potassium and sodium. He gives its composition, according to a mechanical

analysis, as follows :

50 grams of the clay stirred in water gave different residues, which
                   were separated according to their tendency to settle to

of matter soluble in hydrochloric acid, and 2-7 per cent, of carbonic acid ; the re-

mainder beiDg insoluble in hydrochloric acid.

nature of different cows ; conditions and health of them at particular periods; and

changes of the seasons of the year, the author concludes that cows' milk is subject

to considerable variations in composition. He has found in many instances milk

from well-fed healthy cows to contain as little as 10*5 per cent, of total solids, and

from 8-5 to 9 per cent, of solids not fat. The results of other experimenters are

compared, and it is then suggested that the present limits adopted by public

analysts for genuine milk should be reconsidered.

3. Chemical Researches on Palmella Omenta. By Dr. T. L. Phipson,
       F.C.8., London, formerly of the University of Brussels, Cor. Memb. of

       the Chemical Society of Paris, and of the Royal Society of Med. and

        Nat. Sciences of Brussels.

                                        I.

      Palmella cruenta is a minute alga, of a blood-red colour, which is found at the
foot of damp walls, especially where there is much mortar or lime- wash, and always
near to the ground. The older botanists called it Chaos sanguinea, Tremella san-
(juinea, &c, and during wet weather, in summer, this minute plant is not unlike

clotted blood.                                     .

But when giving to it the names just mentioned, botanists could not nave tore-

seen how far this analogy extends, and how many curious points of resemblance thi3

vegetable production possesses with tlie blood of animals. In the first place, when ob-

served under the microscope, it is found to consist of minute spherical cells, about

0-004 of a millimetre in diameter, according to my own determinations, and these
may be easily likened to human blood corpuscles, which I find measure 0-005 to

0-006 of a millimetre, with the same instrument. These little cells, each distinct

and independent, swarm in a kind of mucous substance which may, for analogy's

sake, be compared to the serum of the blood. But I have found that they contain

a colouring matter of a very remarkable character, that will be here spoken of as

Palmelline. Up to the present time there is no substance known to chemists which

at all resembles it, except the colouring matter of blood, or hemoglohine. Like

the latter, it is insoluble in alcohol, ether, benzol, and sulphide of carbon, but

dissolves in water. Like the colouring matter of blood, palmelline is dichroi'c

like it, also, its aqueous solution is coagulated by acetic acid, alcohol, and ammonia,

and it is a colouring matter of an albuminous nature. Like hemoglobine, the new

substance, palmelline, also produces wide bands of absorption in the yellow of the

spectrum, though not exactly in the same position. The solution of palmelline in

water easily undergoes putrefaction with development of ammonia, precisely as

does the colouring matter of blood. Finally, like hemoglobine, palmelline contains

a little iron.

These and other strong analogies are certainly extremely curious, since the two

substances are really distinct ; in other terms, the analogy does not amount to
identity. But it is the first time that any substance at all similar to the colouring

matter of blood has been discovered in the vegetable kingdom.

Palmelline cannot be extracted from the little plant whilst the latter is in a

moist state, for, then, its vitality is such that it does not allow water to extract the

colour. The plant must be dried by exposure to the air for some twenty-four to

forty-eight hours, without the application of any artificial heat. It must then be

placed at the bottom of a porcelain dish containing a little cold water, the dish

being covered with a sheet of glass, and allowed to remain for another period of

twenty-four to thirty-six hours. By that time the colouring matter is almost all

exhausted, and forms a beautiful rose pink solution, if seen by transmission, and

orange yellow by reflection. No other colouring matter is extracted from the plant
in this manner. The dry plant may also be treated first with sulphide of carbon,

and then by strong alcohol ; being afterwards thoroughly dried, water will then

extract the palmelline as before.

    Evaporated to dryness at about 40° C, the solution yields the substance in
question, as more or less crystalline crusts, without any definite form.

     The solution is coagulated by alcohol, ammonia, and acetic acid, producing in
each case flocks similar to the fibrine of blood. It is also coagulated by heat, like

albumine. It yields several wide bands of absorption in the spectroscope : these

Dare situated below in the yellow, and extend into the green of the spectrum.

Palmelline is insoluble in ether, alcohol, or sulphide of carbon and benzol. Its

solution in water enters easily into putrefaction at 25° to 30° C, with a very strong

ammoniacal odour of putrid cheese, and development of swarms of active vih-ios

and bacteria. This decomposition can only be prevented, so as to preserve the colour,

by saturating the recent aqueoussolution with ether. As long as the odour of ether

Ais perceptible in the flask, no decomposition sets in.  little salicylic acid also

preserves the solution for a week or so ; but it modifies the colour, turns it more or

less violet, and takes away the curious yellow fluorescence, which is so characteristic

of palmelline.

    When the aqueous solution is coagulated by alcohol, the palmelline is precipi-

tated as red filaments like fibrine, which soon become colourless. Ammonia and

potash act in the same manner, first turning the pink to a greenish-blue shade, and

afterwards destroying the colour. Sulphide of ammonium turns the solution

yellow without coagulating it. Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid change the tint
of the solution to brick red, which is no longer dichroi'c, and then destroy it,
without coagidation.

    When a few drops of palmelline solution were treated so as to obtain what are

called microscopic · blood-crystals,' like the crystals produced by hematine with

                                   Y2

acetic acid, I obtained a great quantity of rhombic (nearly cubic) plates, colourless,

Aor only slightly coloured.  second experiment gave the same result.

When palmelline obtained by the evaporation of its aqueous solution at 40° C is

calcined, it leaves a small quantity of ash, in which lime chlorine and iron were

detected.

                             II.

     If, instead of drying the little plant by exposure to the air, in order to extract
the pahnelline, as described above, it is allowed to steep for some hours in a large
excess of sulphide of carbon, this liquid soon becomes a dark golden-yellow colour,
and on evaporation leaves, together with a little fatty matter, a large quantity of

-- --xanthophyll the yellow colouring matter of leaves in autumn which is charac-

terised, as I showed in 1858, 1 by dissolving in concentrated sulphuric acid, with a
magnificent emerald green colour. After the complete separation of the sulphide of
carbon, strong alcohol extracts chlorophyll in a very pure state, forming a beautiful
bluish-green solution, which, on evaporation, yields nothing but chlorophyll ; and
this is, perhaps, the easiest mode of obtaining the substance in a state of purity.
When, after these two operations, the alcohol is completely separated, pure cold
water extracts the palmelline in the course of about twenty-four hours.

    By these successive treatments, xanthophyll, chlorophyll, and palmelline are

entirely separated, and the Palmella cruenta contains no more colouring matter.

                                                                                   III.

     But both the treatment by water and that by alcohol, as above made known,
separate, at the same time as thesubatances already named, small quantities of another
very interesting compound, which I have isolated and have termed Characine. It is
the odoriferous substance which is characteristic of fresh water alga, desmids,
diatoms, oscillarice, &c, in general, and is highly developed in plants of the genus
Chara, giving to all these that peculiar marshy odour so well known to botanists.
This odour is due to a substance produced by the plants (a kind of camphor), and
not, as is generally supposed, to some products of their putrefactive decomposition.

      Characine can be extracted from the alcoholic solution, or from the water which
has lain over the dry Palmella omenta for thirty or forty hours. The alcoholic
solution is first mixed with about fifteen times its volume of water, and allowed to
deposit in a closed tube ; the contents of the tube are decanted from the deposit,
and shaken up with a certain quantity of ether. The latter is then separated and
evaporated. It leaves the characine in the form of a colourless greasy substance,
having a strong characteristic marshy odour. It is soluble in alcohol and ether,
almost insoluble in water, to which it communicates its odour ; its specific gravity
is less than that of water, on which it floats, producing those thin films which are
seen occasionally on stagnant water abounding in algae, and on the water of tanks
where alga? are cultivated. Potash does not saponify it. Abandoned to itself it
bither volatilises or disappears by oxidation from the surface of cold water, which
thus loses all marshy odour. But when heated in contact with water, in a closed
tube, it yields a substance melting at 83° C, very similar to ' vegetable wax,' and

having the odour of that substance.
     It can also be obtained from water which has stood for two days on the air-

dried Palmella. On the surface of the liquid, which is of a beautiful rose pink from
the palmelline it has dissolved, are seen numerous thin films of characine. The

liquid can easily be decanted off into a long narrow tube, and shaken up with ether,
which extracts the characine and respects the colouring matter.

     Characine is the substance to which all the fresh-water algae, oscillarise, &c,
owe their peculiar odour whilst in life and health. The Chara fcetida is, perhaps,
the plant in which it is most developed. I hope to make a more complete study of

it at the first opportunity.

4. Description of a Glass Burette for Collecting, Measuring, and Discharg-

                ing Gas over Mercury. By Philip Braham, F.C.S.

The burette consists of a divided glass tube opeu  at both ends, the lower end, A,
                                                                     e[^0
having; a lip and the upper end being covered
with a loosely-fitting boxwood cap.

   A piston, B, formed of a disc of india-

rubber between two plates of steel, connected

to a steel rod, c, is fitted into the tube.

     To fill the burette, the piston is depressed
below the lower end until some of the mer-
cury escapes above it, and on drawing it up

auy portion of the tube can be filled.

    When the gas has been delivered its
measurements may easily be made by lower-

ing the piston till the mercury inside is level

with that out, and the content read off. By

placing the lip under a eaudiometer, on fur-
ther depression of the piston any required

amounts of gas may be delivered for analysis,

the clamp e being fixed to stop the piston

when the required amount is discharged.

The clamp D is used to prevent the piston
descending when the instrument is full of

mercury.

--PRESIDENTJ3F THE SECTION Professor P. MARTIN DUNCAN, F.R.S.£Vice-

                                    President of the Geological Society.

                         THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 1879.

       The President delivered the following Address:

     Everyone who is interested in the science which is especially considered in this
section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science must be impressed

with the importance of the geological construction of this district in determining
its physical geography, in producing the features of its landscapes, and in originating

and developing many of the industries of the busy town of Sheffield.
     It was inevitable that you should be addressed, at the commencement of your

labours, upon the subject of the Carboniferous formation, especially as the intention

of this peripatetic congress is to advance science amongst those who require it.
It will therefore be my privilege to bring before you some of the more important

generalisations of the day, and some other considerations, regarding the great
formation which is so fully developed in this part of England ; trusting that

whilst many of you will submit to be reminded of the results of the labours of
the men who have established our science and of those of yourselves, some who
desire further information than they have hitherto obtained may be advanced in

knowledge.
     Of all geological formations, the Carboniferous is the most important to

mankind at the present time, and the most interesting to the student. It gives the
earliest clear and definite idea of a land surface on the earth, or rather of the
existence of many lands ; for they are to be traced here and there from high up in
Arctic latitudes to Australia, and from the West of America to Eastern Asia.
It offers evidence of the existence, even in those remote days as in the much
later Miocene age, of astronomical conditions which do not now prevail. It yields
proofs of the persistence of a vast lowland flora during extraordinary vicissitudes
of the relative level of land and sea, and of the existence of a fauna remarkable
for its great fish and amphibia, and whose air-breathing mollusca and insecta are

of surpassing interest, foreshadowing as they do many recent forms. And its study

indicates that the movements of the crusts of the earth, which occurred during
and terminated the age, were of the grandest kind, and have been of the greatest
importance to mankind, destroying, it is true, all the vestiges of a large part of a
volume of the earth's history, but bringing coal within the reach of the explorer and

miner.
      This world-wide formation, usually very thick everywhere, has all the evidences

of having lasted during a vast age, and there are present in it the relics of sea
flows, of shallow seas and estuaries, of land surfaces, rivers and marshes. The
volcanic activity of the age was great, and is capable of demonstration.

      So deep are some of the sediments composing the Carboniferous formation in
different parts of the world that the idea of exact contemporaneity is not neces-
sarily much modified. It was in all probability coal time universally, and for a
long duration. But the beginning of the period was not synchronous in different
parts of the earth, neither was the ending. The Devonian age lasted longer in
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  327

some parts of the earth than in others, and the crust movements which so altered
the physical geography of the Carboniferous hills, dales, and swamps as to develop
a new aspect of nature, terminated the period sooner in some quarters of the globe
than in others. In such a locality, however, as Eastern Hindostan, the duration

of a Carboniferous type into the secondary ages is apparent. Hence, in spite of
a recognised general contemporaneity, it must be credited that Carboniferous,
Devonian, Permian, and later deposits were accumulating earlyr and late during the

lapse of one great age in distant parts of the globe.

     The duration of the Carboniferous age in the broadest sense may be attempted,

but with no great success, to be estimated by the time which must have elapsed
during the world-wide dispersion of identical species ; and its biological relation
to the preceding and subsequent formations may be appreciated from the fact that

the Carboniferous flora, lasting as it did from the bottom to the top of the forma-
tion, was foreshadowed in the Devonian, and that it founded the Mesozoic. Thus
the Australian, Himalayan, British and North and South American marine strata of

the Carboniferous age contain many identical species of Brachiopoda--the variation
from the English types, which were the first described, being very slight. Amongst
the corals some forms are equally widely diffused. Now, according to what occurs
in nature at the present time, the movement of species from one locality to another

--by ova, or by wafting of the young the only method of the lateral or horizontal
--progress of the Brachiopoda for instance, is impeded by many physical conditions,

and is constantly rendered abortive by predaceous and obstructive living forms, and
by what is called the struggle for existence. Migration, or rather the extension of
the locality of the species, for the first term implies much more than was or is ever
done, is so rarely possible to any great extent under the present complicated natural
history and physical condition of the earth, that the mind fails to grasp the time
which wovdd lapse between the commencement of the dispersive process and the
establishment of identical species, even a few thousands of miles off. To bring the
subject a little nearer, however, it is necessary to consider that the Arctic and
Antarctic cold areas and the frigid bathymetrical ocean zones did not then exist,
and that the movements of the crust, producing extension of coast lines, were
exceedingly frequent during the age, and must have facilitated the dispersion of
littoral and moderately deep sea species.

     The dispersion of the species of the numerous cryptogamous plants was doubtless

rapid in relation to that of the animals, for their spores could be wafted to a great

distance by wind, and they do not appear to have had much to struggle against.
With the Coniferaa it was different, and the examination of the methods in which

fir trees spread in favourable localities at the present time is very suggestive of
exceeding slowness of dispersion. Nevertheless, the cones of the Coniferse were
carried here and there by water during the Carboniferous age.

     To add to the notion of the long duration of the age it must be remembered
that a succession of identical floras occurred nearly on the same areas, involving
repetitions of growth and of migration.

     The growing of the vegetation of each swamp and lowland tract, its accumu-
lation and covering up with sand, shales, and gravel, occupied much time, and the
last process involved the destruction of considerable breadths of plant life. The

formation of under-clay or warp, if the similar occurrences of the present day be

taken as examples, occupied much time, and then a lapse occurred, whilst the
nearest flora supplied a new vegetation to the virgin soil.

     In some instances the recurrence of vegetation was evidently the result of
spreading from no great distance ; but in others so great a depth of sediment sepa-
rates the consecutive deposits of coal, and the great subsidence which took place is
so evident, that the migration must have been from a considerable distance, and
must have occupied commensurate time. In endeavouring to appreciate this lapse
of time, it must be remembered that, even on the small surface of the United
Kingdom, there was land on some parts during the whole of the Carboniferous
Age, notwithstanding the diversity of the deposits and the frequent occurrence of
marine conditions.

      It would appear that prior to those movements of the earth's crust which ter-
 328 report-- 1879.

 urinated the physical geography of the Devonian Age, three elevated tracts of land
 crossed the kingdom from west to east, and that there were mountainous regions
 running northwards and north-westwards, including North Wales, Western Ire-

 land, and much of the North Atlantic.

      The southern high land barrier passed somewhere in the direction of the Bristol
 Channel, and then to the east and slightly to the south, having a somewhat definite
 continuation with the Ardennes. The central harrier, or high land, passed from
 Shropshire eastwards by Leicester, and then to the coast; and the northern
 was formed by hills in the present Lake district, extending eastwards. On the
 south of the southern high land, the marine Devonian accumulated in a coral sea,
 and to the north of it and between it and the central barrier the Old Eed lakes
 obtained their water supply and sediment from the AVelsh hills of the period.
 North of the central barrier interrupted lakes and land occurred and also to the
 north of the northern barrier. The dry land and the barriers and hills were formed by
 sub-rocks of Silurian and Cambrian age.

      There is no evidence to indicate that the southern barrier was of great height at
 the end of the Devonian period, but there is some which points out that the first
 physical change which initiated a new aspect of nature--the Carboniferous--was
 a general subsidence of the region. The coral reefs sank below the bathymetrical
 zone of the composite forms, and the sea breached the barrier. The southern Old
 Eed lake began to have its waters impregnated with salt, and its great ganoid fish
 were replaced by the cestraciont sharks of the age. These left their remains in
 the bone bed at the base of the lower limestone shales, which are the earliest of the
 Carboniferous series there. The irruption of the sea appears to have taken place to
 the north of the central barrier also, and the subsidence was great there, a limestone
 with some sandy strata forming gradually. In the north and north-east, in the
 present district of the Tweed, deposits collected in shallow water, and vege-
 tation grew which formed the coals at the base of the great Scour limestone.

      On the same and on slightly higher horizons are the coals of Fallow Field,

 Tindall Fell, and Heskett. These are the earliest evidences of the Carboniferous
 vegetation, and it was doubtless in full vigour whilst marine conditions existed to

 the south.

       Probably the high lands constituting the barriers were not covered during the
 subsidence, which permitted the accumulation of the marine deposits of the Car-
 boniferous limestone age. For close to the coal-fields near the central barrier,
 and which rest on upper Silurian rock, borings here found the remains of Car-
 boniferous plants on the palaeozoic rock without the intervention of any sediments.

     Now the depth of the deposit of limestone about this central barrier is great,

 and the question arises how was it produced in the immediate proximity of land
 which was not covered by sea, and which does not appear to have sunken con-
temporaneously with the sea floor close by ? Sinking along definite lines bounded by

 faults, is the only means by which this can be explained ; and this suggestion, which
 was a favourite topic with Phillips, is all the more probable, when it is remem-
 bered that the area of accumulation to the north of the barrier was one of vast
 subsidence during the consecutive ages of the grits and coal measures, whilst there
was land still further north. If the stability of one and the instability of the
other are not conceded, the original height of the barriers must have been stupendous
and beyond example, so far as the size of their bases is concerned.

     There are many examples of what I resolved to call in a presidential address

before the Geological Society areas of comparative instability and which relate

apparently to radial upheaval subsidence along long lines of country where move-

ment has been rare. An instance on the grandest scale is seen in the history of the

Himalayas in relation to the peninsula to their south and south-west. For whilst
this last area was land during a vast age, that of the Himalayas was repeatedly a
marine tract, and suffered subsidences and elevations.

     Still further north and beyond the northern barrier, in the Scottish area,

Carboniferous plants lived a little later, and after a subsidence which permitted the
lower Calciferous series to accumulate. The lowest coals of the basin of the Clyde
are of this age, and the accompanjing clay, ironstone, and the fresh water limestones
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  329

 and gigantic fish of Burdie House are all indications of terrestrial conditions.

 All these evidences of Carboniferous vegetation occur in the geological horizon of
 the Carboniferous limestone and Yoredale series.

      Never entirely free from sandy impurities the Carboniferous Limestones north
 of the central barrier gradually became covered with a thick arenaceous series
 containing here and there marine fossils and traces of coal plants. Those on.
 the Yoredale strata consist mainly of the sediments of a somewhat distant
 north-westerly land, the plants of which were carried to sea by rivers and depo-
 sited here and there on the sea floor. It would appear from the evidence collected
 by the Geological Survey that, after a very considerable thickness of these rocks
 had collected, either a filling up of the shallow sea or a slight upheaval of the floor
 occurred, for denudation of their surface happened, considerable depressions and
ridges being produced on it. On those spaces and ridges, and indeed on the whole
surface of the Yoredale rocks, collected strata which are popularly called the millstone
grits, so well seen west of Sheffield. All the depths of this great land wreckage,
 consisting of silicious and felspathic sandstones' and shales, accumulated on a sink-

ing area, some near land and the rest in deeper places. And here and there coal

seams are found intercalated, being evidences of the existence of contemporaneous

vegetation. Some of them are workable, and others are only valuable as evidences
of the existence of the vegetation of the age ; many are placed on a hard silicious
or ganister bed, but some have an underlying fire-clay. They are very usually
covered with deposits ^containing goniatites and aviculopecten, which doubtless

are the remains of marine organisms.

     Admitting, therefore, that some of this millstone grit coal may be the result of

the drifting and sinking of the vegetation from off lands rather remotely situated,
it is still evident, from the existence of the under-clays elsewhere, that some of the
grits, by silting up, or by slight upheaval, above sea level, formed the subsoil of

swampy ground on which vegetation grew. This approach of the millstone grit
sea floor to above sea level was decided enough in the region of the great coal-field

-- --around us, for a conglomeratic rock the rough rock occupies a somewhat defi-

nite horizon on the top of the series.

      This rough rock collected in shallow water, and it is important to the geolo-
gical surveyor, for it formed the base on which the coal measures proper rest
and it is suggestive to the physical geologist that a general and wide, but not great,
upheaval took place which removed the ocean of the day further off, and which
determined a total change in the direction of sediment-depositing currents.

     Hitherto the greatest thickness of the sediments of the millstone grit age had
been towards the north-west, and the direction of the currents had been from
north-west to south-east, but subsequently, as has been suggested from very strong
evidence by Sorby, the depositing currents of the next age had no very definite
direction. But the Carboniferous land of this part of Europe was not yet remote

from the sea. Much of it was on the borders of estuaries, and the aspect of nature
was probably that of wide flats of grit covered usually by terrestrial vegetation and

occasionally overwhelmed by sea. In fact, both practically and theoretically there is

much difficulty in separating the millstone grits from the lower coal measures. The

lower measures contain some thick and widely-spread sandstones, and the important
coal seams, in some instances rest on a hard ganister bed, and in others on a fire-

clay. And to add to the similarity of the deposits of the upper grits and lower coal

measures, marine fossils, such as species of goniatites, aviculopecten, and posido-
nomya, are intercalated above the coals. But the evidences of marine invasion
ceased as the deposits accumulated, and more perfect terrestrial conditions arose. The
Elland flag-stones, for instance, such prominent features to the west of this town
and in the neighbourhood of Halifax, are fresh-water deposits, and are undoubtedly
accumulated in an under-clay indicative of terrestrial conditions.

     In the region north of the northern barrier successive coal seams and impure
limestones and fire-clays occurred during the age of the depositions of the English
grits, and then a thick fossiliferous sandstone was followed by the upper coals of
Mid-Lothian.

     All the minor upheavals and upsiltings of this long age were subordinate to a

progressive general subsidence, in which the central and northern barriers were
slightly implicated, and this extraordinary crust movement was to continue during
the accumulation of over 3,000 feet of coal measures and other deposits, all subaerial
in their method of formation, or having collected in shallow water or swampy ground.
These products of denudation and of organism succeeded each other time after time

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

great gravels, shales, and sands were intercalated, and even traces of some of
the rivers of the age are to be found breaching the seams. The more the subject,

commonplace as it may be thought, is considered, the more astonishing does it

become, for"the regularity of the subsidence and its amount must have kept pace
with the thickness of the accumulating deposits. That there were many long

intervals of quietude in the earth's crust may be gleaned, not only from the thick-
ness of many coal seams, but also from the subaerial denudation which occurred.

For instance, high up in the eries in this district, is a mass of red sandstone which
covers the denuded middle measures beneath; and this red rock of Rotherharn,
the result of coal measure denudation and removal, accumulated during the early
days of the upper coal measures, for it is lower in the geological series than some
members of the uppermost coal measures.

      Before the close of the age, marine conditions occurred in the rock, and a
limestone with goniatites was formed ; but still coal seam formation proceeded
until a totally different series of crust movements commenced in this country.

     The flexures which were produced at the close of the Carboniferous age had

--their long axes east and west ; they suffered denudation and on the worn edges of their

 strata rest the ' used-up Carboniferous ' the lower Permian. Elsewhere, resting
apparently and often really conformably on the Carboniferous strata, the Permians
accumulated until great north and south curvatures occurred and produced the
Pennine chain.

      The denudation of the anticlinal or upward curves of the north and south
flexures progressed, and the coal measures, once continuous across England, were
worn off along the back-bone of the country and from off the east and west ridges
also. Vast as was the destruction and removal, there was still more compensa-
tion in nature, for faulting occurred on a large scale, and the measures were in
many places sunken down below the level of possible subaerial denudation.
It is to the pre and post Permian crust movements in producing basins and in
uptilting the formerly horizontal seams, and to the subsequent faulting, that we owe
 the preservation and the possibility of reaching and working much of the coal of

 this country.

      It appears that the position of this town refers quite as much to some remark-
 able faults, and the results of the past Permian uptilting, as to the presence of the
river Don. Two important lines of fault run almost parallel, the one traversing

 the centre of Sheffield, and the other being to the north of the outcrop of the
 Silkstone coal. They pass, nevertheless, in a north-easterly direction, and the

 country between them is much broken. Moreover, by a combination of the

 results of uptilt and faulting, the strike of important coal seams has been so altered
 that they encircle the town on the south, west, and north. The mineral products
 have thus been brought within the reach of those by whose industry this town has
 increased in size and population.

     With regard to the lithology of some of the great series just mentioned, it may

 be suggested that the condition under which the beautiful limestones of the
 Avon, and the dark, shaly, muddy, calcareous deposits of the corresponding
 age accumulated in Scotland, were very different. The stone in the southern
 example is many-coloured, and is nearly an organic deposit, whilst the shaly strata
 of the northern series have crowds of calcareous fossils in them. Remove the shaly
 substance, however, and consider and compare the fossils of both localities, and no

 satisfactory distinction can be drawn between the depths at which they may have

 accumulated.

      Both deposits contain crinoids, polyzoa, brachiopoda, and simple and compound
 hydro-corals. The same occur in the limestones to the north of the central barrier,
 which are intermediate in the arenaceous condition between those just mentioned.
 It is admitted that the mineral condition of the original deposits has altered, and
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  331

it is possible that much impurity may have heeu removed by percolating car-

bonated waters from the purest of the limestones. And, indeed, unless this is
credited, it is impossible to compare some of these old marine sediments with any

bow forming on the floor of the sea. All the known calcareous sea floor deposits

contain a very considerable percentage of silica and other matters, and if the
Carboniferous limestones were ever in the condition of modern deep-sea ooze, in
order that they should have looked like the chalk they must have lost, in some
manner or other, more than 35 per cent, of impurities. So far as I can understand,

much of the Carboniferous limestone may have accumulated at no very great depth

and on banks within the scour of currents, and their prevalence would account for

the comparative absence of sandy sediments in some situations. No traces of Atoll

formation exist.

     With regard to one or two late discoveries relating to the organic remains of
the Carboniferous limestones, it is necessary to refer you to Moseley's important work
amongst the Tabulata. These must now be removed from the true stony corals,

and some will be relegated to the Hydrozoa, and others to the Aleyonaria. It is
a fact of great interest that Sorby should have noticed that whilst the modern
true corals are built up of carbonate of lime in the form of arragonite, the great

tabulated forms of old are composed of calcite.
     Quite lately Mr. Busk has been investigating the large polyzoa of the genus

Heteropora, and I saw, under his manipulation, that this recent and Crag group,

with strong palaeozoic affinities, is so constructed that the branching tubular or-
ganisms of the oldest rocks with perforations in their walls and tabulae must be

included amongst species of genera closely allied to it.

    A host of ill-defined tubular forms, such as the Stenoportc, will thus find a final

zoological resting-place.

     The arenaceous series of the Carboniferous formation in England are not less

wonderful than the Calcareous. They thin out very rapidly from 10,000 feet in
the Burnley district to 100 close to the central barrier in Leicestershire, and it
would appear that the sea drift was from the present region of the North Atlantic,
along the shores of the swampy coal-plant growing land.

     The arenaceous deposits to the south of the central barrier have the same general
relation 'as those to the north, and the grits of the Welsh and Bristol coal-fields are
silicious, and were in all probability derived from the Silurian and Old Red rocks

--to their north-west. The culm measures of Somersetshire and Devonshire those
--thick deposits with impure thin coals with limestones towards the bases are of the

age of the upper parts of the Carboniferous limestones and of .the grits of the central
area. The evidences in this age of the denudation of granite and other silicious
lands, and of more or less distant diffusion of the sediment, extend far and wide
from the United Kingdom, a belt of similar rocks being found in south-western
and central Europe. It is, moreover, very probable that the upper Vindhyau rocks
ofHindostan, those fine sandstones and grits which have yielded the building-stones
to the great Gangetic cities, are of the same relative age (or slightly older) as

the strata of which so many Yorkshire towns are mainly built.
     Whence came the thousands of feet of the sands and shales of the coal

measures ? is as yet a question which cannot be answered. It appears that very
widely distributed deposits of the same kind are comparatively rare amongst them,
and that most of the organic deposits, as well as the inorganic sedimentary, do not
extend over great breadths, but are more or less lenticular in shape, or thin out
or become changed in their lithology. This fact and Sorby's suggestion that the
currents which deposited the strata had not any definite course rather tend to the

belief in the former presence of a vast delta during that ancient aspect of nature.

It is certain that some of the vegetation which subsequently became coal, and many

feet of the roof above, were not always formed with great slowness, for stumps and
trunks of trees have been found standing where they grew, with their roots in
their under-clay and their stems wrapped round with coal, and the shale and gravel
above. Moreover, in some places, a series of these interesting relics exists, one set
being placed above the others.

    With regard to the coal itself, varying as it does in its physical peculiarities,
                                        --'

332 report--1879.

all that has an under-clay grew as vegetation on land. It is at present rather diffi-
cult to believe that where a coal seam is found upon a hard silicious bed without a
vestige of clay or of old soil, its plants were rooted there. But the stigmarian
roots are not unfrequent in the ganister, and at the present time a peculiar vege-
tation is growing on the grits to the west of this town with a very small amount of
humus intervening. Some coal seams, especially the cannels, would appear, how-
ever, not to have been produced by plants which grew on the rocks beneath, and
they are the result of vegetation drifting and becoming water-logged.

     In reflecting upon the history of those Carboniferous deposits in relation to the
subsequent great changes in the physical geography of the earth, the idea that
geological histories repeat themselves does not obtain that importance with which

it is credited in relation to human events. It is true that there were important

 Triassic, Oolitic, Wealden, Neocomian, and Tertiary lands whose vegetation has
been metamorphosed into a kind of coal. But the wonderful depth and the
extraordinary vertical repetition of organic and inorganic deposits, of the Car-
boniferous formation, and the remarkable crust movements which enabled them to
accumulate, are without subsequent examples.

      In conclusion, I must remind you that the volumes of the ' Geological Record
give the literature of the Carboniferous formation year by year, and that lately a
magnificent contribution to the subject has appeared in the memoirs of the
Geological Survey of England and Wales in the form of a great volume on the
geologyof the Yorkshire coal fields, by Professor Green, one of our Vice-Presidents,

Aand Mr. Russell. very concise and excellent geology of the West Riding has also

recently been published bv Mr. Davis, who is amongst us to-day, and Mr. Bauer-
mann has contributed a capital article on coal to the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica.'

2. Notice of the occurrence of a Fish allied to the Goccosteus in a bed of

       Devonian Limestone near Chudleigh. By John Edward Lee, F.G.S.,

        F.8.A.

      In this paper the author mentions the discovery of a fish, allied to c< iccosteus, in

 the Devonian Limestone of Lower Dunscombe, near Chudleigh, and endeavours to
 show that this fish occurs in the middle or upper part of the Devonian Limestone,

just as it is found chiefly in the upper beds of the Old Red Sandstone. He also

points out that, from being associated with goniatites, clyrnenia, and crinoidal
 remains, it cannot have been a fresh-water fish.

3. Notice of Fossils found in a bed of Devonian Rocks at Saltern Cove, in
       Torbay, and in a quarry of the Old Red Sandstone, near Caerleon, in

       Monmouthshire. By John Edward Lee, F.G.S., F.S.A.

      In this notice the author states that the fossils found at Saltern are precisely
similar to those found at Biidesheim, in the Eifel, which are commonly considered
as Upper Devonian, and he therefore believes that, as the fossils are identical, this

small exposure at Saltern may be considered as Upper Devonian. He exhibits a

 small series of fossils froru both places, to show their identity.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  333

    The latter part of the paper describes a quarry of the Old Red Sandstone in
Monmouthshire, containing apparently an abundance of comminuted vegetable
remains, and also several specimens of pteraspis, one of which he believes to be

new.

          4. On the Nomenclature of the Plates of the Crinoidal Calyx.
                           By P. Herbert Carpenter, M.A.

     According to the present system of nomenclature there are two distinct sets
of plates in the calyx of the Crinoids, to which the name bascds is given. In
Platycrinus, and in all those forms in which there are only two sets of plates in
the calyx, the upper set were called radials by Miiller, while he termed the lower
set, resting on the upper stem segment, the basals. This was perfectly correct, for
their position is interradial, and they correspond in every respect to the basals of
Pentacrinus, the calyx of which genus was taken by Miiller as a type on which
he based his analyses of the calyx in all the other Crinoids.

     In Cyathocrinus, however, there are two rows of plates below the radials, and
the plates in the lowest of these were called basals by Miiller because they rest on
the upper stem-joint. Nevertheless, they are not homologous with the basals of
Pentacrinus and Platycrinus, because they are radial in position. But intervening
between them and the radials is a second set of plates (the so called parabasals or
subradials), which alternate with both series, and are therefore interradial. I
regard these plates as the true basals, while the lower (radial) set are homologous
with the under basals of JEncrinus, which were discovered by Beyrich. They are
absent in the Apiocrinidae, except perhaps in A. Murchisonianus, in all the recent
species of Pentacrinus and in most of the fossil species, but they occur in P.iriareus
and in P. subangidaris, where they have been wrongly described as the basals.
This name, however, really belongs to the next series of plates, the so called para-
basals, or subradials, which are inter-radial like the basals of P. caputmedusae, and
pierced like them by bifurcating canals, so that there is no doubt as to the homology
of the two series.

     The American palaeontologists have sometimes followed Beyrich and some-
times followed Miiller in their system of nomenclature. For example, Heterocrinus
has two rows of plates below the radials which are variously called (1) subradials
and (2) basals, or (1) basals and (2) sub-basals. The relative positions of these
two rows are always the same, the upper (subradials or basals) being interradial,

and the lower (basals, or sub-basals), being radial. As the former (interradial)

series represents an important element in Echinoderm morphology, being homo-
logous with the (likewise interradial) genital plates of the urchins and star-fishes,
and is also of great morphological importance in the Crinoids themselves, it is
very desirable that it should always bear the same name ; and also that this name,
basals, should not be used for plates which are neither interradial in their position

nor constant in their occurrence. Similarly-named parts are usually supposed to

be homologous ; but if we give the same name to plates which are radial in one
species and interradial in another, we disregard the principles of homology

altogether, and introduce unnecessary confusion into the study of echinoderm
morphology.

     Beyrich has already remarked on this and has led the way towards a more
rational and scientific nomenclature, by introducing the name ' under-basals ' for

the radially situated plates which occur beneath the true basals of Encrinus.
      If it be objected that these under basals, resting as they do upon the upper

stem-joint, form the true base of the calyx, let us retain the name basals for this
radial series, and call the upper (interradial) series the sub-radials, as is generally
done at present. This, however, would necessitate our discarding the name basals
altogether for such forms as Pentacrinus caputmediisae, &c, and, as it was first
used for the lower row of plates in the calyx of this species, such a step would
be inconvenient. The fact remains that the lowest part or base of the calyx is
formed in some Crinoids by interradial, and hi others (the minority) by radial

plates ; and the precise nomenclature we employ is not of much consequence. The

important point is that homologous parts should be similarly named, and that

parts which are not homologous should not receive the same name as if they were

so. In the latter case, Echinoderm morphology, and especially that of the Crinoids,
Webecomes greatly confused.
                                            cannot then say that the basals of the Orinoids

are homologous with the genital plates of the urchins and starfishes. One set of

plates so-named does answer to this description, but the other set does not, for it

is altogether unrepresented in the other Echinodernis.

                         5. On the Goal Fields and Coal Production of India.
                   By V. Ball, M.A., F.G.8., of the Geological Survey of India.

    When exhibiting the new geological map of India to this Section at the last

meeting of the Association in Dublin, the author gave a brief sketch of the geology

of India. On the present occasion he deals with the economic resources of one of

the principal formations.

     The coal-bearing rocks of Peninsular India are all included within the limits of
the great series of plant-bearing rocks to which the term Gondwana has been
applied, and they are further limited to two groups of rocks which occur in the

lower portion of that series.

    By some authorities the age of these Gondwana rocks is supposed to be equiva-

lent to that of the European formations which range between and include the

Lower Oolite and the base of the Trias (Buntsandstein). By others the lower

measures, including the coal, are believed to be palasozoic. The author proceeded to

give an outline of the recent discussions on this subject, referring particularly to

Mr. W. T. Blandford's judicial summary of the evidence in the lately issued ' Manual

of the Geology of India.'

     The distribution of the coal-bearing areas was then pointed out on a series of
maps which were exhibited, and the number of distinct coal-fields was stated to
amount to about thirty. Some details were then given regarding these fields, of
which five only are worked at present, namely, Banigunj, Kurhurbali, and Dalton-
gunj in Bengal, and Mopani and Warora in the Central Provinces.

     The total area of the Indian coal-fields is estimated by Mr. Hughes at upwards

of 30,000 square miles. Three countries only contain larger areas, viz. United States
500,000, China 400,000, Australia 240,000.

     The amount of coal raised in India varies a good deal from year to year with
the supply of sea-borne coal in the market ; this latter depends very much on the
amount of tonnage available. Wars, famines, and other extraneous influences

arising from time to time, bring a greater or less number of steamers and ships to
the Indian ports, and these, in default of other cargo, often load up witli coal.

     During the last twenty years coal from Australia has been imported into India

somewhat fitfully, and the supply from that source has now nearly dwindled

to nothing.

In quality the Indian coals are inferior to the average of English and Austra-

lian               but they are capable of  accomplishing good work  in locomotives, and for this
                ;

purpose they are largely employed on the main lines of railway in India. And

were it not for the long and expensive land carriage from the fields in Bengal and

the Central Provinces to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies there can be little
doubt that they would be employed to the exclusion of all foreign sea-borne coal.

Partly from this reason, and partly also from the impurity of the coals, they are
not largely used in steamers, but even in this respect their employment is steadily
increasing. Some of the steam companies rely chiefly upon them, and the swift
opium steamers which run between Calcutta and China use Indian coal mixed in

equal proportions with English.

The author proceeded to give further details as to the quality of the coal,

--stating that the anthracite varieties were rare, the general character being bitu-

minous and the structure laminated bright and dull layers alternating.

In Bengal the mines are worked by a number of different companies, some of
                                                         ;

                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.               335

which conduct their operations with method and skill, and are financially in a very
prosperous condition, others work in a more or less slovenly manner. In the
Central Provinces one of the mines is worked by Government, hut has not as yet
repaid the outlay uuon it.

     In round figures it may be stated that at present 1,000,000 tons of coal are
consumed in British India per annum in locomotives and factories, the quantity

employed in the form of coke for domestic purposes being inconsiderable ; and
that of this 1,000,000 tons, about one-half is raised from Indian mines, the other
coming from England, France, and Australia.

6. On Geological Episodes. By J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.

     Geological nomenclature was first founded on the theory of universal deposits -
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    t

then the idea of lateral changes was introduced with the necessary misuse of litho-

logically descriptive names ; ultimately all deposits were seen to have their boundaries.

Beds deposited in distinct areas can thus be proved only homotaxial, and these

are by no means necessarily synchronous. The object of this paper is to show that

Aa somewhat similar principle ought to govern all our geological classification.

single area is defined to be one over which we can trace one or more related for-

mations consecutively, and which formations contain identical characteristic fossils.

Deposits in single areas may be compared as to time and divided into life zones \

but these in different areas are homotaxial only. In each single area the outlines

and characters of the several deposits must first be determined and denoted ac-

cordingly.

In studying any group of rocks in a single area it is seen that some members

have a much wider range than others. Such differences in range are accompanied

by marked differences in character and point to differences in the circumstances of

deposit. The wide-spread formation indicates uniform changes of level over the

--area and a mixture of deposits such circumstances may be called normal. But

mere local changes may bring more restricted areas into peculiar physical condi-
tions. Such local changes may be called ' geological episodes,' and they will result in

the formation of deposits of marked character easily distinguishable from the normal.

The first point is to determine the characters by which an episodal deposit may

be differentiated from a normal one. The supreme test is that derived from its
definition, i.e., its local development ; but if it be very small, it may be insignificant
if relatively very large, the distinction may be of no consequence. As a rule argil-

laceous rocks are normal, and arenaceous and calcareous episodal ; but this is by no

means universal. When the normal formation of a period is determined, the

episodes are marked by their differing mineral nature. The two kinds of deposits

may also be determined by the nature of their fossils, after we have first dis-

covered what kinds of fossils are usually episodal. For this purpose those fossils

which are found in all kinds of rocks, and therefore appear to have been indifferent

as to their physical surroundings, may be called invariant, and those found only
under particular conditions, and which change their locality as these conditions

change, covariant. Invariants only are suited for zonal classification ; covariants
Aare characteristics of episodes.
                                   table is drawn up showing the classes, families,

and genera which may be covariant, according to the imperfect observations of the

-- --past. The chief covariants are a few Foraminifera the sponges a large number

of Hydrozoa and Actinozoa, some Crinoids, the Blastoids, a few Lamellibranchs,

and at least half the Gasteropod families.

     The main proposition is that similar, but distinct episodes, in a normal series of
strata are neither necessarily nor probably of the same aye. The true method of

feological classification is therefore to arrange only the normal deposits in a series

y their stratigraphy and their invariant fossils, while the episodes are put in their

place as such.

    These doctrines applied to British strata yield the following results : No episodes
are recognised in Cambrian or Pre-Cambrian rocks. In the Lower Silurian, the Dur-

ness limestone, the Llandeilo flags, the Bala limestone,and the Caradoc sandstone, and.
--336
report 1879.

the May Hill and Llandovery beds are characterised as such. Hence the term ' Cara-

doc ' is inapplicable as a name for the normal portion of the series. The ' Colonies ' of
Barrande maybe episodes recurrent on the same area. In the Upper Silurian, the Wen-
lock and Aymestry limestone, the Denbigh grits, and Tilestones are episodes. The
Carboniferous series present us with the Coomhola grits, Burdie House limestone,
Millstone, and Pennant grits, while the Mountain limestone is merely a gradually
changing normal deposit. The episodes of the Permian are the fossiliferous lime-
stone and underlying marl slate. The absence of the Muschelkalk from England
is not regarded as due to its being an episode, but to our deposits as a whole being

formed in a distinct area, the true episodes of the period being the Hallstadt,
St. Oassian, and Dachstein beds. The Lias is remarkable for its great freedom
from episodes, which accounts for the success of its zonal classification, the only
exceptions being the Sutton series, and some of the Middle Lias rock beds. The

lower Oolites, on the contrary, are almost entirely episodal, none of the beds having

a wide range. The Yorkshire deposits were formed in a distinct area, and may

cover the period of the Great Oolite as well as the Inferior Oolite, the deposits sup-
posed to connect them with the latter being episodes. The rocks above the Corn-

brash formed one connected series, as recognised by all German writers and some
French, in which the Kelloway rock, the Corallian, and the Portland rocks are well-
marked episodes in this country. It is therefore suggested that the term ' Middle
Oolites ' should be abolished from the classification of British strata, and the whole
be known as Upper Oolites. The various episodes in this series on the Continent and
in England will never be truly located until their real character is seen, and it has
been by the study of these rocks that the doctrine of episodes has been suggested.

   --In the cretaceous series the Wealden, the Tealby ' series, and parts of the

Lower Greensand are episodal, the ironsands being the nearest approach to a normal
formation. The Upper Greensands are also episodes ; but the Chalk, though calca-

reous, is normal.

     The Lower Tertiaries, like the Lower Oolites, scarcely present any normal
deposits, the London Clay being, though argillaceous, episodal in character.

     In the result, the series of sedimentary rocks should be represented not by so
many parallel lines, but in many cases by lenticular masses, whose age is denoted

--by their position according to a table which presents their true character. It is
-- --urged, therefore, that the names proposed or else some better be used to dis-

tinguish the different kinds of strata and fossils, in order to give definition and.
importance to truths which must have long been floating in the minds of geologists.

         7. On the Keuper Beds between Retford and Gainsborough.
                                By F. M. Burton, F.G.S.

      After describing the general position of the beds in relation to the Triassic
system, and remarking on the absence of the Upper Mottled Sandstone, as well
as the ' Muschelkalk,' in this part of England, the author described the Various
strata of the district, as shown on the line between Retford and Gainsborough, and

pointed out the want of any division in the beds of the Lower Keuper Sandstone,
as iu other localities, ajid the absence of any boundary line between this series and
the ' red marls ' above. From the base of the Lower Keuper Sandstone, which
rests directly on the ' pebble beds ' at Retford, to the Keuper marls at Gains-
borough, beds of light red clays, veins and blocks of gypsmn and thin lines of
ripple-marked sandstone occur throughout, and it is only when the highest beds of
the Keuper marls are reached that anj' kind of stratification is discernible ; bands
of red, blue, and grey earths occurring just before the rocks dip under the Rhsetic

beds at Lea.

     The author remarked also on the singular changes in the composition of the
gypsum as the higher beds are reached. In the Lower Keupers at Retford, up

to the ' red marls' at Gainsborough, this mineral is invariably fibrous or satiny in
character ; in the higher beds, however, it changes, at first, to rubbly patches, and,
afterwards, to large granular or saccharoid blocks.
                                            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                    337

    On the subject of life, the author was only able to record, from the beds in

question, doubtful impressions of a shell, strongly resembling Pullastra arenicola
of the Rhsetics, and annelid burrows; but he had hopes, after more minute

research, that further remains would be discovered in some of the more highly
developed beds of the series, which would throw fresh light on their structure, and
tend to establish their marine or estuarine origin.

    From the fact of the same line of dip existing between the ' pebble beds ' and
the Lower Keuper Sandstone, notwithstanding the absence of the intervening
Upper Mottled Sandstone and ' Muschelkalk,' the author inferred that the beds in

question were deposited at a period of great and long-continued tranquillity, an
inference which was borne out, he considered, in this part of England at least, by
the position and contents, as well as the general configuration and line of dip, not
only of the Rhsetic beds above, but of the several Liassic, Oolitic, and Cretaceous
strata beyond, and on through the Tertiary deposits to the present time.

8. On a Northerly Extension of the Bhcetic Beds at Gainsborough.
                         By F. M. Burton, F.G 8.

At the meeting of the British Association at Nottingham in 1866, the author

announced the discovery of beds of the Rhsetic age at Gainsborough, a full account

of which will be found in the ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for

1867.* These beds occur to the south of Gainsborough, on the Great Northern line

between Doncaster and Lincoln, and were discovered through the lowering of the

gradients of that line in 1866. The author has since found them in a cutting of the

Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway at Blyton, about five miles to the

north oi Gainsborough, where they must have been exposed since the making of

that line in the year 1848, though hitherto they have remained unrecorded.

Though much defaced by vegetation and the action of the weather, they appear to

be of the same thickness as those at Lea, to the south of the town, and doubtless

are of the same character and composition. The Keuper escarpment, in which

these beds are situate, continues northward through Lincolnshire, east of the river

Trent, to the south bank of the Humber, and extends on the other side into York-

shire                      and  though, at  present,  these  beds  have  escaped  detection, the  author  had  no
                        ;

doubt that, wherever the true junction of the Keuper marls and Lower Lias is

laid bare, there beds of the Rhfetic series will be found.

Wirksworth, about the year 1820, accidentally come upon in the workings of a
lead mine. The finding in it of the remains of elephants, an almost perfect skele-
ton of the rhinoceros, and other remains of the same animal, established the
fact of the existence of great extinct animals in that part of the world in olden
days. In 1875 Mr. Mello found in the caves of Oresswell Grags bones of animals
and remains of man's handiwork. The latter were of the highest interest, and
led to an important chapter in the history of ancient man upon the earth. Last
year his and the author's explorations were fitly ended by the working out of an en-

tirely new cave down ' Mother Grundy's Parlour.' Among other remains discovered

in the caves of Oresswell, Professor Dawkins named the hyena, the bison, the reindeer,
the lion, the hippopotamus, and the bear. Besides these traces of the lower animals,
there were in the lower strata rude and rough implements of quartzite, together
with fragments of charcoal, proving that man was living in the district in those
days. In the upper were more highly finished implements of flint, bone, and
antler. The most important contribution, however, which had been offered to
the history of man in this country was the discovery of a sketch of the horse
engraved on a small fragment of bone. The subject of that engraving brought

the cave-men. into relation with those in Switzerland and France, for instance,
where similar works of art, of a by no means low order, had been met with.
Comparing the remains of implements, the rougher and the more highly finished

specimens, they had evidence of the development of man in culture. In 1876
the author and Mr. Rooke Pennington explored a cave known as Windy Knoll,
near Oastleton, and came across a ' swallow ' hole or chimney, containing vast

quantities of the remains of the bison, the grizzly bear, and of some wolves and

foxes. They also met with large numbers of the reindeer. He was able to make
out an interesting point relating to the time of the year when some of these

animals visited that part of the country ; it being pretty clear the bison were there
in the summer, and possibly in late spring ; and the reindeer in whiter. The last
cavern that had been explored was discovered at Matlock Bath, in 1879, and the
remains of animals found were of the same sort as those met with in Oresswell
Ora^s. The next most important thing they would like to have settled was - the
age of those caverns, but that he looked upon as an impossibility. There was
nothing to show that they existed before or during the Glacial period, and all the

--attempts which had been made to fix a date outside the written record in the
--pages of the historian he looked upon as mischievous, because they put before

the minds of people who did not know, a definiteness with regard to geological

events which those events did not possess.

             4. Discovery of a Bone Cave near Cappagh, Co. Waterford.

       By R. J. Ussher and Professor A. Leith Adams, M.A., F.B.S.

     The above cave is in a limestone knoll that rises above a flat containing gravel.
The sides of this flat are bounded by similar knolls and cliffs of limestone. The
cave, which is tunnel-shaped, was, when discovered, nearly filled to its roof with
stratified deposits. The ujyper stratum consisted of dark brown earth, closely
packed, containing stones, both angular and worn, the latter chiefly sandstone.
The numerous bones found in this stratum were yellow and recent-looking, and were,
when not small, usually broken. They represented man, pig, horse, red deer, ox,
goat or sheep, dog or wolf, fox, cat, marten, hare, rabbit, and birds. Charcoal
occurred frequently. In the top stratum were also found, near the cave's mouth, a
polished symmetrical celt of greenish stone, and near it a large flattened bead of a
reddish transparent substance. At about fourteen feet inside the entrance was found
a cut bone, of the size of a small gimlet-handle, with a hole drilled through it trans-
versely, also the broken shaft of some carved implement with one barb or catch
remaining ; and at various points stones suited to the hand with ground surfaces, or
with their edges chipped as if by use. In one rock crevice was found the shin-bone
of some ruminant formed into a chisel, and in another a bone knife handle that
had held an iron blade, and was ornamented with concentric circles on its four

sides. Both the latter articles may have got into the crevices where they were
found from the top stratum. The second stratum was clearly defined from the
first, was of a grey colour, very distinct, and contained much carbonate of lime that
in places formed white seams in it. Much charcoal occurred in this stratum, and
in part of the cave formed a faint black seam reposing on one of the white a'bove
mentioned                                      while underneath this more

stratum, but deep in that below it. The bones in this second stratum were <?ene-
rally blackened and had whitish dendritic markings. They represented man ox

and metatarsal bones were split lengthways, often into narrow strips. One meta-
tarsal was not only cleft in two through both extremities, but strips of bone which

we found had been severed from it. Some of the Irish elk's bones appear to have
been gnawed by some carnivorse. Fragments of the antlers were also found
Along with a lot of the elk's remains (including the split metatarsal) was found a

extremities chipped, some on both edges, as if by human use, and others that were
ground down. Two fragments of coarse, hand-made pottery, blackened by fire on
the concave side, were obtained either from the first or the second stratum Under
the second stratum was crystalline stalagmite, forming in the inner part of the cave a
solid floor from 2| to 3£ feet in depth, but in the outer part of the cave it had been
broken up into blocks, which were enveloped in a pale sandy earth underlying the
two upper strata. This sandy earth contained charcoal in several places and bones

ot bear, pig, deer, dog or wolf, and hare. The ursine remains were of very laro-e

individuals, equal to Ursus speleeus in size. On removing a floor of stalagmite that
had not been broken up we found numerous bones of a large bear embedded in it,
as well as the creature's mandible with the teeth, also teeth of deer ; while embed-
ded in the stalagmite and under it we got an astragal of Irish elk and a metacarpus
ot deer, short and stout, with the deep postern furrow of reindeer. The lowest
stratum that reposed on the floor of the cave consisted of a coarse brown sand
mixed with gravel composed of fragments and pebbles of purplish, greenish, and
yellow sandstone. This was

5. On some remarkable Pebbles in the Boulder-clay of Cheshire and
            Lancashire. By Charles Ricketts, M.D., F.G.8.

Erratic pebbles, ice-marked and otherwise eroded, occur abundantly in the
Boulder-clay of Cheshire and Lancashire. There are others not so exceedingly
infrequent which, with or without eroded surfaces, bear indications of weathering
but in such peculiar forms that it cannot have occurred under conditions existing
in the British Isles at the present time. Some blocks of granite, volcanic rock
and sandstone are weathered all over, except at a necklike portion where they have
been broken off as at a joint. Others of granite and trap are completely disinte-
grated, sometimes even throughout the whole mass, but each individual <ranule
remains in its original position. Whilst other trappean blocks, generally partially
striated, have portions of the surface roughened and honeycombed, the disintegrated
material remaining attached in the form of a light

instances the whole surface is eroded, causing organisms to project in relief: more

frequently a considerable area is affected whilst the remainder continues ice-

scratched and intact ; often hollows or channels have been formed, the other portions

retaining the ice-marked surface. In some instances of impure limestone the car-

bonate of lime has been dissolved away in parts, leaving behind the insoluble sand

Aor mud.  few blocks of carboniferous limestone not only bear marks of glacial

erosion, but are covered with borings fonned by marine animals ; one example is

likewise chemically eroded in channels.

Even some hard quartzites have not escaped weathering, as indicated by con-

cealed joints and by channels hollowed on their surface.

Single fragments of glaciated pebbles of Silurian grits and slates are often found

detached ; a very few have the separate pieces lying at a short distance from each

otter: but in many, though quite separate, they are exactly in apposition, the

pebble itself being broken into two or many parts.

    From the examination of these different examples of glaciated and weathered
pebbles, it may be inferred that they had formed portions of moraines on land, and,

as a consequence of being there exposed repeatedly to successions of frost and thaw,

have become thus weathered and split into fragments ; those blocks of limestone

which have been perforated by marine organisms bear evidence to their deposition,

for a period, in a moraine accumulation beneath the sea. Subsequent to this reces-

sion an increase of snow-fall has caused an extension of the glaciers, which in its

progress carried forward the accumulation into the sea, either directly, or by joining

a main glacier from which the bergs have been broken off that conveyed away these

boulders. As these erratics are common in the Boulder-clay at different horizons,

it follows that there must repeatedly during a prolonged period have been a

succession of instances of an advance and retreat of glaciers similar to what is

recorded as taking place in Greenland. 1

    When examining moraine accumulations, pebbles of carboniferous limestone

were obtained which were glaciated, weathered, and fractured, in a similar manner

to some from the Boulder-clay ; also similar fractured pebbles of Silurian grit and
of Longmynd rock have been met with under the same conditions.

The existence of these pebbles both in moraines and also in the Boulder-clay

--illustrates what had been deduced from previous investigations in the Valley of the

Mersey that in Britain, during what is called the Glacial Period, ' the glaciers did

not progress from an immense accumulation in the north, but were formed by the

snow-fall in the respective valleys ; being of such an extent only as might reason-
ably be considered due to the amount of deposition on their water-slopes.' 2

6. On the Volcanic Products of the Deep Sea of the Central Pacific, with
    Reference to the ' Challenger ' Expedition. By the Abbe A. Renard and

     T. Murray.

     The mineralogical and penological researches on the sea-bottom of the Pacific
area extending from the Sandwich Islands to the 30th degree of S. latitude, and

having the Low Archipelago in its approximate centre, show that volcanic matter

plays an important part there. It i3 present in the form of lapilli and of ashes
spread in great abundance in the ' red clay.' These lapilli nearly all belong to the
basaltic type, passing from the felspathic basalts to allied rocks in which the
vitreous base assumes greater and greater development until it almost completely
displaces the crystalline constituents of basalt. The fragments then become true
glassy rocks of the basic series, in which are still found generally crystals of
peridote, and numberless crystallites which are sometimes grouped in opaque
granules or arranged regularly around the niicrolites of peridote. The forms of

 these volcanic fragments, which are often coated with manganese, their association
 with volcanic ash, and their lithological constitution, shows them not to he derived

--from submarine flows of lava. They must rather be regarded as incoherent pro-

 ducts lapilli, the accumulations of which form in the Pacific a series of submarine

 tuffs.

      One of the most remarkable facts elicited by the soundings in the Pacific is the
 large share taken in these sedimentary deposits by palagonites, quite identical in
 lithological characters with those of Sicily, Iceland, and the Galapagos Islands.
 One may, in fact, call them glasses of the basic series, playing the most important
 part among the sediments of the Pacific, and consisting either of sideromelane or
 decomposed into a red resinoid substance. The small lapilli, of 2 or 3 millimetres
in diameter, are cemented by zeolites, the crystalline forms of which are those of
christianite. It is enough to indicate the presence of the easily alterable basic
 glasses in order to show the source of the clayey matter with which they are
 associated, since it is known that wherever rocks of this type occur there also

decomposition into clay is observable.

     Among the minerals present in the volcanic ash are rhombic tabular crystals of

plagioclase, augite, magnetite, with very little sanidine or hornblende. It is also
remarkable to notice that in these deep-sea deposits quartz-grains are practically
absent, in striking contrast to the coast deposits. It is not, however, this fact
which is most worthy the attention of the Section, since it is not so unexpected as
the formation of zeolites in the free state. The latter phenomenon takes place in
the zone in question, where fibrous radiated spherules are found in the mud, 0'5mm,
in diameter, and possessing the crystallographic character of christianite. Besides
these zeolotitic globules there are other crystals of the same kind in the form of

small prisms, not more than -026mm. in length, and occurring in such prodigious
mimbers that they form about a third of the red clay. Orystallographically these
microlites must be referred to those forming the zeolotitic spherules. The authors
regard them as belonging to one species. The formation of these zeolites and of
the red clay in which they are developed is easily understood if one bears in mind
the lithological nature of the above-described basic tuffs and of their decomposition-

products.

        7. On Ammonites and Aptychi. By Charles Moore, F.G.S.

The author remarked that ammonites and aptychi are always found associated to-

gether in beds of secondary age, the latter organism never being met with beyond

the range in time of that shell. The Aptycus is a peculiar triangular-looking body,

usually bilobed, oftenest found loose in  beds  containing  ammonites                                              but  now and
                                                                                                                ;

then in the outer chamber which that animal occupied during life. In structure

it appears to be partly calcareous and partly corneous or horny.

    Probably no organism has given rise to so much speculation or to more diverse
views as to its zoological position. As far back as 1811 it was described as a bivalve
shell and named Trigonellites by Parkinson, since which time it has been raised to

the genera Munsteria and Aptychus, or considered by other authors as the plates of

fishes, valves of cirripedes, internal bony plates of Teudopsis, the gizzards of ammo-

nites, or a parasitic body attached thereto, and at last the general view arrived at
and still entertained is that they are the opercula of ammonites.

     The great variety of opinion thus entertained has arisen from the ammonite
having become extinct, its only living analogue being the nautilus, and even of this
genus only two or three examples with the animal have ever been obtained, one of
which was dissected and described by Professor Owen, the aptychus in the ammonite
being supposed to represent and to occupy the position of the fleshy hood in that

shell.

     In a paper published some years ago the author expressed a doubt as to the
aptychus being an operculum, one reason being that it was not of sufficient size to
cover the mouths of the shells in which they happened to be found, though for other

reasons he had no doubt they were allied. He had now obtained new facts, which

he would first give, and if he afterwards suggested any heterodox notion his justifi-
--342 report 1879.

cation might be found in the views propounded by the many learned geologists who

had preceded him.

The variety of forms which the aptychi assume appears to indicate almost a

generic modification in the forms of the animals occupying the shells to which they

Abelong. In the earliest known British ammonite (the . planorhis) it is in one lobe

only, with coarse concentric lines of growth, finer longitudinal strife being visible

by aid of the lens. In this species an inner layer is always black, as if stained by

the pigment of cuttle fish, a circumstance seen also with some others from the upper

has. The author considered this might be due to the presence of animal matter to

which the lobes were originally united. Although so many ammonites were known

in the lower lias, he was only acquainted with the above species from this formation.

In the upper lias they were oftenest found in connection with ammonites in a bed

of about a foot in thickness, which he had called the Saurian and Fish bed, and in

the clays which surround it. From this bed he had obtained microscopic ammo-

nites, in which the aptychus might be seen far back in the outer chamber. They

were found also in another remarkable way. Larger ammonites were deposited in

the upper portion of this bed, but the shell itself has disappeared, leaving usually

only the mould where it lay. It has not been washed out, but dissolved away,

probably by carbonic acid. Strangely enough, in many examples the aptychus

which was in the interior of the shell has not been affected by this action, and the

siphuncular tube also has been left passing round its whorls where once were its

many chambers. The fact that the aptychus belongs to the ammonite is shown by

its presence in such minute specimens, by there never being more than one example,

Aand by a special form being united to each species of ammonite.   remarkable

point respecting the siphuncular tube is that it is not the mere tube as usually seen in

other ammonites and nautili, but has an envelope of concentric layers surrounding it,

increasing considerably its usual bulk. On examining the moulds of Ammonites ser-

pentinus the author stated that he was surprised to find that their surfaces were covered

by hundreds of thousands of minute scattered eggs, some apparently hatched, whilst

other larger ovate bodies were possibly an advanced or metamorphosed form of the

same animal. Amidst these scattered eggs there were also strings of similar eggs,

though at times somewhat compressed and varying in size, lines of them lying to-

gether. In one instance the siphuncular tube passes over the aptychus, but they

had not been noticed actually in connection. The question arose to the author,

' What have the aptychi and the tube to do with these eggs ? Can either or both

be an ovarian sac ? '

Minute examinations of different forms of aptychi were then made, when it was

found that in every instance they were almost entirely cellular, and the author was

able to extract from them lines of cell-tubes, differing in scarcely any respect from

the egg packets lying amidst the scattered eggs on the Ammonites serpentinus of the

upper lias. Aptychus lsevis of the Kimmeridge clay had yielded him great numbers

of globular bodies which, though converted into iron pyrites, were undistinguishable

from the eggs of the upper lias. In smaller numbers they were also found in

Aptychus lamellosus. Both tubes and clusters of eggs were also obtained from the

curiously formed Aptychus Didmji, whose curved and bold lines of growth gave a

twisted form to the tubes. Microscopic sections of Aptychus Didayi and A. Icevis

showed what appeared to be eggs within their cellular tubes. The thinness of the

structure of the upper lias species might seem almost to preclude this tubular cha-

racter, but on examining unworn specimens it may be seen that the laminse fold

over like Venetian blinds, and that their edges are fringed with tubes, coming to the

surface, and which pass down obliquely through them. When the corneous layer

which covers the concave side of the aptychus lobes is removed, myriads of minute

cells are visible ; these, as they pass through the body to the convex surface,

bifurcate and enlarge.

     The layer referred to is as thin as tissue paper ; the author had been able to
remove and preserve an example of this layer which, under the microscope, was a

beautiful object; comparing small tilings with great it looked like the gnarled sur-

face of a walnut-wood table, and showed the structure with openings in the centre

.of concentric circles passing round the tubes immediately below.

     In his examination of the character of Ammonites planorbis and its aptychus,

he had obtained curious and interesting results. He had found animal matter in

the interior of the whorls of the shell, probably the equivalent of the siphuncular

membrane as seen in the upper lias specimens. This contains thousands of rounded

egg-like bodies in its substance.

     All these facts were scarcely consistent with the idea that the aptychus was

simply an operculum. He hoped to obtain further evidence before asserting posi-

-- --tively that possibly with the siphuncular tube it is an ovarian sac, but the facts

he had already worked out he thinks tend to that conclusion.

     The fossil fish remains so named were found in association with Ganoid and
Elasmobranch fishes of the genera Megalichthys, Ehizodopsis, Ooelacanthus, and

Gyracanthus, Ctenacanthus, and Pleuracanthus and several others, in a bed of

cannel or stone coal, a few miles SE. of Halifax. This peculiar Ichthyodorulite

Uis nearly inches long, and | inch broad at the base. From the base the diameter

diminishes" rapidly, and at i an inch from the apex it is only -15 of an inch. It
remains about the same to the apex and ends in a blunt point. The upper part

is smooth and covered with hard ganoine. The lower part is grooved longitudinally,
increasing by bifurcation towards the basal end. Extending from the base, there
is a mass of bony matter, joined to the spine ; this is produced into two or three

short denticles, it then becomes thinner, but again expands into a mass which may
very well have served as the base of a second spine, if one was present. The only
fossil spine bearing any resemblance to it is Byssacanthus of Agassiz. It is, how-

ever, only a superficial resemblance, and this one cannot be arranged under that

genus. It also exhibits great similarity to the spines of Ostracion cornutus, the

Trunk-fish, one of the Siluroid Teleosteans. Prof. Huxley has advanced several

reasons for considering the Old Red species, Ooceosteus, Pterichthys, &c. as nearly

related to the modern Siluroids. It appears probable that the present specimen

may be a representative of the Teleosteans during the coal period. It may be

premature, considering the fragmentary nature of the specimen, to express such

an opinion, but the spine and its attachments are so different to all other fossil
fish remains which have been found in this country that I venture to suggest that

such may be the case, and that further discoveries may place its relationship
beyond doubt. I suggest the name Ostracocanthus dilatatus, as expressing its

resemblance to that of Ostracion and indicating its wide and dilated base.

In support of this opinion the following facts were cited : The Yorkshire coal-basin
was admittedly pre-Perniian, for north of Nottingham the magnesian limestone
everywhere overlaps the coal measures ; but the axis of this basin is parallel with
and was evidently determined by the same series of movements that upraised the
Penine chain. The Permians disappear on the west in approaching the Penine
chain ; in this direction also the marl slates attenuate, and the marl slates and
magnesian limestone become more sedimentary, as if approaching a margin.
Mountain limestone pebbles occur in Permian breccias on one or both sides of the

Penine axis. Many fragments of carboniferous rocks occur in Lower Bunter Sand-

stone (breccias) on the borders of Notts and Derbyshire ; but the author finds no

fragments of Permian rocks in these breccias. No outliers of Permian rocks are

found at any distance west of the magnesian limestone escarpment between
Nottingham and Northumberland. The character and succession of the Permians
on the two sides of the Penine chain are very dissimilar.

3. On the Deposit of Carbonate of Lime at Hierapolis, in Anatolia, and the
  Efflorescence of the Limestone at Les Baux, in Provence. By Dr. Phen^,

    F.G.8., F.8.A.

     The author brought this subject forward as part of a duty which he considered
ought to be recognised by travellers, of giving examples of matters of an exceptional
character coming under their notice, the more, so when, as in the present case, the

particulars might be turned to purposes of utility. He had selected these two

distant sites of calcareous deposit, not alone from their picturesque beauty and
effect, but because they presented, he believed, the two most widely differing
conditions of a somewhat similar material probably to be found. In the former
case, the deposit of lime was so rapid that a large extent of country was covered
with it. Its forms were eccentric and yet so beautiful that there was hardly auy

style of ornament the simulation of which would not be found in it. The Roman

city, which took the place of a former Grecian one, was half submerged beneath
 a sea of rock of intense hardness, which, blocking up streets, temples, and vast

 arches, after reaching to a certain height, viz., the level of its source, ran over the

natural aqueducts which it formed as it went, and began new ones lower down,

 which it again and again, as it reached the level of its source, repeated. He had

 counted six or eight of these natural walls nearly 50 feet in height, which, if they

 have been formed in consecutive order, give many hundred feet of deposit since

 the Bonian occupation, perhaps within about 1,500 years. Part of the deposit
 was perfectly white, the other part quite black, giving the most singular
 appearance, as it looked like a snow drift lying in the intensely hot sun of Asia
 Minor, or a cataract of snow falling over black rocks, or a frozen cascade, which
 could only be illustrated in drawing by giving a representation in black and white,
 while the other parts of the landscape were in their usual natural colours. The

 Turks called it Pambuk Kalessi, or castle of cotton, from its whiteness. The

  destruction of this city by being hermetically sealed in stone, contrasts strangely
 with that of Eski-Hissar or Laodicea, on the opposite range of hills, which has
 had its stone edifices reduced by earthquake almost to a level. The hardness
 of this deposit, and the rapidity of its formation, contrasted strangely with
 the stone at Les Baux, which, though by no means soft to cut, had from its
  natural cavities suggested the idea to the founders of the city of excavating their

 houses in the sides of the rocks, quite as much as they built them outwards. This

rock, ·with little or no warning-, disintegrates and discharges itself in efflorescence
in the air, producing an effect as destructive to the city built there as in the
former case, with quite as picturesque an effect, though from an exactly opposite

cause. So much was being done now in ascertaining the component parts of stone

for the purpose of hardening, as in the recent experiments on the Houses of
Parliament, Cleopatra's Needle, and other well-known works, that it occurred to
him that an analysis of these two rocks of similar component parts, but with
varying conditions, would be well worth the attention of the chemist and the

practical constructor.

            2. On some Broad Features of Underground Temperature.
                          By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.

r ' The temperature at the surface of the ground is not sensibly influenced by the
flow of heat upwards from below, but is determined by astronomical and atmo-

spheric conditions.

     The rate of increase in travelling downwards from the surface may conveniently

be called the temperature-gradient, and averages about one degree Fahrenheit for
fifty or sixty feet. This is about five times as steep as the temperature-gradient in
the air.

    If we draw isothermal surfaces for mean annual temperature in the ground,

their form beneath mountains and valleys will be flatter than that of the surface
above them. This is true even of the uppermost, and the flattening increases as

we pass to lower ones, until at a considerable depth they become sensibly horizontal

planes.

     The temperature-gradient is consequently steepest beneath gorges, and least

steep beneath ridges.
     In a place where the surface of the ground and the isothermal surfaces beneath

it are horizontal, the flow of heat will be vertical, and the same quantity of heat
will flow across all sections which lie in the same vertical. In this case the flow
^across a horizontal area of unit size will be equal to the product of the temperature-

gradient by the conductivity, if we employ the latter term in an extended sense,_ so
as to make it include convection by the percolation of water, as well as conduction

proper. It follows that, in comparing different strata lying in the same vertical,
the gradient will vary in the inverse ratio of the conductivity. It seems probable
that the same law of inverse proportion between gradient and conductivity holds

much facility for equalisation of temperature by currents between the colder water

above and the warmer water below, that they furnish no useful results. Even in

bores of small diameter the same disturbing cause exists, and always makes the

observed less than the true gradient.

Observations in mines will be vitiated by the presence of pyrites, which

generates heat by its slow combustion, and are also liable to be vitiated by strong

         3. On the Botanical Affinities of the Carboniferous Sigillarice.
   By W. C. Williamson, F.B.S., Professor of Botany in Owens College.

     The affinities of the Sigillarise are still in dispute. The English palteo-botanists,
apparently without exception, regard them as representing the highest modifications

of the Lycopodiacese. The French palaeontologists, and to some extent the
American ones, elevate them to the Gynmospermous group. The question is of
importance, both geologically and in reference to the problem of Evolution.

     The only plants associated with the Sigillarise in the Carboniferous forests, that
exhibit any possible affinities with them, are the Lepidodendra on the one hand,
and the Gymnospermous Dadoxylons and Cordaites on the other. Adopting the

processes by which we ascertain the affinities of any newly discovered plant, we

obtain results which appear to the author sufficiently conclusive. The old
idea that Sigillarise must have been large branchless stems must be abandoned.
Various examples, such as Lepidodendron Selaginoides, which the French palaeon-

tologists claim to be Sigillarian, branch like other Lepidodendra hence, whilst of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

some forms the branches are yet unidentified, this branchless state is most probably
not a characteristic condition. Then the external leaf-scars of Sigillarise exhibit

nothing distinctive. Whilst in some types we have the vertical flutings of the

stem and the linearly disposed leaf-scars of the Syringodendra, typical examples,

such as Sigillaria de-gam and spinulosa, along with many others of Brongniart's

species, exhibit the diagonal arrangement of the leaf-scars characteristic of the
unquestioned Lepidodendra. Then no one ventures to doubt the absolute identity

of the cortical tissues in the two types of Lepidodendra and Sigillarise. It is
only when we reach the vascular axis that we find the supposed distinctions
upon which the French botanists rely. These distinctions rest wholly upon
the fact that, according to them, the Lepidodendra have a vascular axis in
which the scalariform vessels are not arranged in any radial order, nor increased in
bulk by any exogenous mode of growth, in the Sigillarise, whilst the central
part of the vascular area is occupied by a cylinder in all respects identical with
that of the Lepidodendra, it is surrounded by an outer zone in which the vascular
wedges are radially disposed, are separated by medullary rays, and have grown

exogenously through the operation of a cambium-layer.
      Whilst the author recognises the existence of these differences between the

Lepidodendron Harcourtii on the one hand, and the so-called Sigillarue, elegans and

spinulosa,^ on the other, he denies that such differences are even generic, much less'

ordinal, since in several cases they can be shown to be due solely to age. Three states

of Lepidodendron Selaginoides demonstrate this. In the one extreme form we

have the central non-exogenous vascular axis, giving off foliar bundles, but unens

closed by any exogenous zone. In the extreme opposite condition we find the

foliar vascular bundles apparently given off from the exterior of an exogenous zone
of the supposed Sigillarian type. In reality, these foliar bundles pass from the
inner cylinder through the outer one, but only appear conspicuously in transverse

sections at the exterior of this latter exogenous cylinder.
    But the author's cabinet contains intermediate examples, in which the stems
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  347

exhibit the transition from the younger or non-exogenous to the more advanced or
exogenous type. The cambium-layer has not developed throughout the entire cir-
cumference of the stem simultaneously, but has begun at one point, at the periphery
of the non-exogenous cylinder, from which point it has extended slowly right and
left, so as gradually to have crept round this inner vascular axis. In the specimens
referred to, this exogenous cylinder is incomplete, exhibiting a crescentic form, the

crescent being thickest at the centre, where the cambium-layer began to form, and

gradually becoming thinner as we approach the extremities of its two lateral

horns. This crescent, in different specimens, only embraces from one-third to two-

thirds of the circumference of the non-exogenous axis ; hence we have the anoma-

lous condition of a plant one side of which is a Sigillaria and the other a
Lepidodendron. Unless new features can be found other than what is often
designated the Diploxyloid condition of the vascular axis, whereby to distinguish
Sigillarise from Lepidodendra, the above-named distinction must obviously be
abandoned as having no'generic value.

    When a Lepidodendron was about to dichotomise, the vascular cylinder, as seen

in transverse sections, splits into two horseshoe-shaped halves. The author ex-
hibited specimens showing exactly the same conditions in a Sigillarian example.
The invariable dichotomisation is in itself a Lycopodiaceous feature.

     But one more remarkable fact is now demonstrated, which appears even yet
more conclusive. M. Van Tieghem has carefully shown that the idtiniate roots of
the Lycopodiacese and of the Ophioglossse have a structure which does not reappear

in any other portion of the vegetable kingdom. In the Cycadeae and Conifers, as
well as in the other vascular cryptogams, the centre of each root is occupied by a
cellular procambium enclosed within a pericambium or special cellular sheath.

From this sheath, at points located at measured distances and in varying numbers,

several, but never less than two, bundles of vessels are developed. The first
formed vessels are of small size ; but the more newly added ones increase in size as
each bundle develops centripetally, until their converging lines meet in the centre
of the procambium. But at the free ends of the peripheral portions of the roots,

in the case of the Lycopodiums, and throughout their entire length in the

Selaginellae, only one such procambial bundle makes its appearance. When per-

--fected this bundle exhibits a triangular form in the transverse section the apex of

the triangle, which always remains adherent to the pericambium, being occupied by
the small and first formed vessels, whilst its broad base, composed of larger vessels,

projects into the centre of the pericambium. These conditions reappear in the
most exact manner in the rootlets of the Stigmaria Jicoides, which all paleon-

tologists who know anything about the matter now admit to be the roots of
Sigillaria, as well as of Lepidodendron. This latter fact appears to the author, when
combined with the numerous other features which the plants have in common, and

with the absence of all real differences beyond such as are due to age, to be conclusive
of at least the ordinal unity of the Lepidodendra and the Sigillarise, and of the
Oryptogamic character of both.

                                By J. H. Collins, F.G.S.

    The author had examined during some years the stratified rocks of West Cornwall

(marked as Devonian on the Government maps). 1 He discussed the determinations

of fossils, especially the fish remains of Lantivet Bay and other districts, and con-
 tended that they partook more of the character of Upper Silurian than of Devonian,
 and showed that the stratigraphic evidence supported this conclusion.

     He then showed that these rocks rested upon Lower Silurian rocks, which, how-
ever, covered a very much more extensive area than was shown on the official

maps.

    He also stated that still older rocks, of at present indeterminate age, came up

from beneath the Lower Silurians at several points on the coast, and especially on
the north, between Newquay and Perranporth, and suggested that the mica-schists
·of the Lizard were probably of the same age as these last-mentioned beds.

     In conclusion, he drew attention to the vast periods of time indicated by the
successive changes in direction of the folds in the strata, and to the vast amount of

metamorphism to which all the rocks had been subjected. He also suggested that
the rarity of fossils in many of the older beds might be due to the existence of a

highly-minerahsed condition of the waters through which the sediments fell, and
which would cause those sediments to be charged with mineral matter. The sub-
sequent segregation of these substances into later-formed fissures would account for
the abundance and richness of the Cornish mineral lodes.

  6. The Surface Bocks of Syria (suggested by the Quarries at Baalbek).

              By James Perkt, B.E., County Surveyor, Boscommon.

    The country of Syria, where there are vast areas of irregular bare limestone rock,
with alternations of heat and rains, and where the radiation into a clear sky at

night is considerable, gives evidence of the action of a geological agent not taken

much account of by persons who five in and visit countries where the hard rocks

are mostly covered with a considerable thickness of soil, gravel, or clay.
     I visited in the neighbourhood of Beyrout some quarries of a peculiar kind of

sandstone. Beyrout is situated on a limestone coast, but to the south of the town
there is a shifting field of sand which extends itself in varying directions as the
prevailing winds vary, and it at the present time threatens to bury a considerable
portion of the town, gradually advancing over a few additional houses each year.
The sandstone in question is formed by a mixture of particles of limestone from the
coast and the sand I have spoken of, which drifts and consolidates layer by layer
into a series of low hillocks ; these are one connected mass, and the mass is in-
creasing in an evident manner under existing circumstances, although it is cut into
caves and passages by quarrying the stone for building purposes. The stone is un-
equal in composition and appearance ; in some places there is more carbonate of
lime than in others ; in parts the fantastical appearances of drifted snow are shown
in miniature ; and in many places the stone looks like rigid sponge. The mass is
made solid by the action of rain water which dissolves the particles of carbonate of
calcium, and, on being slightly elevated in temperature, re-deposits the carbonate
of lime so as to cement together the particles of sand. It is this function of lime-
stone in solution, affected by change of temperature distinct from mere evaporation
(a cause usually supposed to effect more than I think it is capable of effecting), to
which I wish to direct attention.

     I have been at least a mile inside a stalactitic cavern whose floor was a river or
lake, the atmosphere was continuously saturated, and if there be evaporation it is
very slight indeed, where the stalactites were of huge proportions. The idea that
these stalactites are formed when water which has filtered through hundreds of
feet of limestone reaches an atmosphere slightly higher in temperature than the

rocks, appears to me the correct one, although the rotten incrustations on the
intrados of masonry bridges may be accounted for principally by evaporation.

     I have repeatedly come to the assistance of housekeepers in limestone districts,
by recommending a little hydrochloric acid to remove the deposit of limestone in
glass bottles where water is kept for drinking purposes, and this is clearly a case of

the kind of deposition in question.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                       349

Persons quarrying in Syria will find the good compact stone on the surface, and

the explanation is the dissolving and depositing action I have described. This

state of" things is persistent all over the country, and in places I found a satisfactory

explanation of a matter which had long puzzled rae, viz., the formation of marble.

When a bed of mud dries it shrinks and cracks ; if the first set of cracks is filled up

with mud of some different colour, of cohesion equal to or greater than that of the

--principal body of mud you may imagine a second system of cracks filled with a
--slightly different colour, and so on you will have such an appearance on
Nowmaking a section parallel to the surface as is shown in the diagram.*
                                                                          it

is easy to see that if the process of solution and deposition set up by the action of

rain water and sunshine tends to cover the country with a solid cake of crystalline

limestone, expansion and contraction at the surface continually forms cracks which

descend more or less deeply into the mass. According to this, from a plane sur-

face there should proceed an irregularly columnar structure. This is observed in

pieces of veined marble to some extent, but since the surface is not a plane surface

but a changing surface, the columns intersect. Marbles of the kind I am describing

are actually in course of formation at the surface of the ground. It is, however,

quite plain that many marbles may have been subjected to heat metamorphic action

after the veining has been produced.

     It will be seen that all over the surface of a limestone country where the

proper conditions exist, there may be formed a universal cake of limestone varying

in thickness from 1 to 10 or 12 feet, and in some instances being 20 feet or more.

Such a formation will produce large blocks of stone, and it is from such a formation

the enormous blocks 14 x 14 x 64 at Baalbek have been quarried.

7. On certain Geological Facts observed in Natal and the Border Countries,
     during Nineteen Years' Residence. By the Rev. George Blencowe.

     The basal rocks of the coast are shale, with superincumbent sandstone, which has
apparently received its present configuration from subsidence, as the strata dip at
an inclination corresponding with the surface, and are cross-fractured. In this
sandstone district a square mile of granite protrudes, with a few large loose blocks
on one side and mounds of decomposed granite in the neighbourhood.

     The sandstone is succeeded in the middle belt of Natal by deep beds of shale,

in thick rusty strata, having in its higher portion blocks of sharp-angled trap
scattered on the tops of the hills.

     The northern portion of Natal is a white sandstone capped with trap, which

in a high plateau of about fifty miles in length is undisturbed, but in the remaining
portion has been scooped out by an abrading force, which has left ridges and
isolated hills, corresponding in structure with the plateau, and like it with unbroken
horizontal strata.

    At the south-eastern extremity of this plateau there is a district, in and on

the edge of Zululand, in which are evidences of violent volcanic action at a
period intermediate between the deposit of the sandstone and the varied shale on
which it rests. The two most conspicuous evidences of such action are an extinct

mud volcano and the turning up beyond the perpendicular of a thick bed of vitrified

shale.

     In these newer sandstones coal abounds at various heights, and over a distance of
several hundred miles. The water supply of this district is peculiar, coming from
the surface of the basaltic trap, and not from the sandstone which underlies it.

     The distinguishing peculiarity of this part of Africa is the presence of isolated
hills of sandstone and trap on a high plateau, from which they rise 2,000 feet ; from
their correspondence of structure they have evidently at one time been united.
The difficulty in accounting for their original construction and their present condi-

tion is the absence of all evidence of volcanic action in their neighbourhood and

of debris, the result of abrasion.
      In the higher region petrified timber abounds, but no coal is found ; while in the

lower coal is abundant. The valley of the Tugela, which has been cut through the
sandstone and trap to more than 2,000 feet in many places, reveals a depth of 1 500
feet of sandstone in diminishing strata, and occasionally shows basaltic trap at

apparently long intervals of deposition.

       The following Reports and Papers were read :

     3. On the replacement of Siliceous Skeletons by Carbonate of Lime.
                           By W. J. Sollas, M.A., F.G.S.

      The author gave an account of certain calcareous fossil remains which exhibit,
 both in gross and minute structure, a close resemblance to certain existing siliceous
sponges, and which differ widely from any known form of calcareous sponge. The
 natural inference appeared to be that the calcareous fossils were once siliceous
 sponges, the siliceous parts of which had undergone replacement by carbonate of
 lime. The alternative view that the fossils were originally calcareous, and that they
represent an extinct group of Calcispongia, was discussed and shown to present far

greater difficulties to the zoologist than the inferred mineral replacement offered to
the chemist. Siliceous sponge spicules were stated to be remarkably soluble,
 yielding readily to the attacks of minute boring algas, and undergoing solution in
 sea water soon after the death of the sponge which possessed them.

      The Radiolaria of the Carboniferous limestone were likewise regarded as having
once possessed a siliceous composition, which they had since exchanged for a

calcareous one.

       4. On Carboniferous Polyzoa and Palceocorynm. By G. R. Vine.

     In this paper the author drew attention to the inadequate study that had been
given to the Carboniferous Polyzoa. During the last few years vast masses of
shales, containing polyzoal and other remains, have been brought to light, but none
that he was acquainted with excelled in richness the Hairmyres debris. Here the
specimens were well preserved, and the characters of the several species almost

perfect.

     The author considered that it was too early yet to draw up a classification that
would be satisfactory to all naturalists. Attempts had been made to do this, but
many details had to be furnished that could only be furnished after close study.
Besides the Fenestetta, other genera were alluded to in theraper, such as Ceriopora
Hhabdomeson, Hyphasinapora, Glauconome, and Diastopvra, but these are being
studied analytically, and further details of their structure will be brought forward

in a future report.

     The Palmocorynce were next alluded to, and the author said that he had
identified all the species and forms of Palceocorijnce that had been figured by Dr.
Duncan in his various papers. But the conclusion the author had arrived at was,
that these so-called organisms were neither Hydroid, as was supposed by Dr. Dun-

--can, nor foraminiferal, as was suggested by Dr. Allman all the forms were refer-

able to species of Fenestella and Polypora. Although this opinion was given with
some confidence, the author was not prepared to say at present that the whole of
Dr. Duncan's views were illusive. There can be no doubt but that the forms P.

scotica were really infertile processes; but P. radiata had presented so many

peculiar details to the author, that until he had satisfied himself as to the nature

and purpose of this structure in the Polyzoary of the Polyzoa, he was not prepared
to substantiate that Dr. Duncan had given an erroneous judgment. Although P.

radiata may turn out to be after all a portion of Fenestella, and not a parasite. 1

5. On the Classification of the British Pre-Cambrian Bocks.
                   By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.O.8.

The author divides the Pre-Oambrian rocks into four groups, under the follow-

ing names,  in  ascending order :  1,  Leioisian                                     2,  Dimetian ;  3,  Arvonian                                        and  4,
                                                                                  ;                                                                   ;

Pebidian.

1. The Leioisian, so named by Sir R. Murchison to indicate the crystalline

rocks of the Hebrides and North-Western Highlands of Scotland, is retained

for the oldest group at present recognised in Britain, and largely developed in

the Hebrides. It is found also in parts of the Malvern chain, the north-west of
Ireland, and possibly also in Anglesey. The prevailing rocks in this group are
massive gneisses, in which hornblende and red felspar are the chief ingredients, and

quartz, chlorite, and mica but sparingly present. They are usually of a dusky red,

grey, or dark colour. Sometimes almost a pure [hornblende rock is found. The

strike in these beds is usually E. and W., or some point between that and N.W.

and S.E.

     2. The Dimetian. This group is largely developed in Wales, as at St. David's,
Caernarvon, Rhos Hirwain, and Anglesey. It has been found by Dr. Callaway

in Shropshire, and I have recently seen it in the Malvern chain, especially in

the Worcester Beacon. I noticed it also last year in large development at Ben
Fyn, Loch Maree, and near Gairloch in Ross-shire; as well as at several other
points in the North-Western Highlands of Scotland. The prevailing rocks in this

group are granitoid and quartzose gneisses, with pinkish, flesh-coloured, or white

felspar; and with limestones, micaceous, and, occasionally, chloritic and hornblendic

bauds. Brecciated beds also occur, in which bits of the older Lewisian ouieiss are

sometimes found. The strike is generally N.W. and S.E., or from this to N. and

S. It evidently overlies the Lewisian unconformably in the areas where both have
hitherto been found associated, and its highly quartzose character and lighter
colour generally is in marked contrast to most of the members of that group.

    3. The Arvonian. At the last meeting of the British Association I mentioned

for the first time the discovery, or rather the separation, of this group. It is largely

developed in Pembrokeshire and Caernarvonshire. It occurs also in Anglesey and

Shropshire, and I have recently found it at the base of the Harlech group in the

heart of the Harlech mountains. I have seen masses of it also from the Orkneys,

and it probably occurs both in the Western Islands and in the Grampians of Scot-

land. It is the great Halleflinta group of the Swedish geologists, and the Petro-

silex group (Hunt) found so largely developed in North America. It is chiefly
made up of quartzo-felspathic rocks, sometimes porphyritic, frequently brecciated
and of compact quartzose rocks or halleflintas, which on microscopical' examination

duced and fully discussed.--G. R. V.

Nhave frequently the appearance of incipient gneiss. The strike is usually ahout

and S., and it overlies the Dirnetian unconformably.

4. The Pebidian. This being the newest group in the Pre-Cambrian rocks, is

the least altered in character, and most nearly approaches in strike to the overlying-

unaltered or Cambrian rocks. It resembles that group in many of its rocks, and on

that account was for a time supposed to be identical with it, only that it had

undergone local alteration. Now we know it underlies the latter unconform-

ably, and that the apparent similarity in character is to be attributed to the fact

that most of the Cambrian rocks were derived from the denudation of this group.

That it was also in a high state of alteration before the Cambrian rocks were de-

posited upon it is evident from the fact that an abundance of pebbles and masses

of it occur in the conglomerates at the base of the Cambrian. It consists for the

most part of chloritic, felspathic, talcose and micaceous schistose rocks ; alternating

with massive and slaty greenstone bands, dolomitic limestone, serpentine, lava-flows,

porcellanites, breccias, and conglomerates. It is traversed also frequently by dykes

of granite, dolerite, &c. It is a group of enormous thickness, and is largely dis-

tributed over Great Britain. It occurs in many parts of Wales, in Shropshire, and

in Charnwood Forest. I found it also last year in the North-West of Scotland, and

have seen specimens of it, collected by Mr. James Thomson and others, from

Islay' and others of the Western Islands. Dr. Hunt recognised it also along the

Crinan Canal, and in the vicinity of Lough Foyle in Ireland. It is probably re-

presented in America by the Huronian group. The prevailing strike is N.N.E. to

S.S W., or from this to N.E. and S.W. The conglomerates at its base are largely

made up of  masses derived from the Arvonian                                                                                                                                    and  it  is  undoubtedly at most  of
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

     of Geology in the University of Durham College of Physical Science,

      Neivcastle- on- Tyne.

     The word ' Culm,' locally denoting an impure, ' smutty ' kind of coal in the
West of England, is now applied by geologists to the series of beds containing
this coal in Somersetshire and Devonshire. The horizon of these series is generally
admitted to be that of the Millstone Grit, with, perhaps, the uppermost portion of
the Upper Carboniferous Limestone series (vide Murchison, Renevier, &c).

     The German geologists, soon after the recognition of the Carboniferous age of
the greater part of their so-called ' Jungere Grauwacke ' in 1838, adopted for it the
term Culm (spelt JTulni), chiefly, it would appear, on the strength of the charac-
teristic fossil Posidmiomya Becheri which is common to these slaty rocks and to
the Culm beds of Devon. Under this name of Kulni are now grouped a vast mass
of carboniferous slaty beds, which strike across Europe from Eastern Silesia to the
westernmost point of Portugal, and include most of the puzzling deposits scattered
over Southern and Central France. These were formerly classed as belonging to
the vague ' Terrain anthraxifere,' and as representing in age the entire Lower Car-
boniferous series, of which they must be regarded merely as a great altered shaly

or non-calcareous facies.

       The President delivered the following Address :

In responding to the honour which the authorities of the British Association have

conferred in nominating me to fill this chair, I have deemed it hest not to occupy
your very valuable time with any matter of detail at which I may happen to have
worked, but rather to offer to you a few remarks on questions which seem to me

to have a general biological interest.

    Last year my esteemed friend, Professor Flower, called your attention to the

--great name of Linn^tjs. I propose this year to refer to Linnaeus' illustrious

contemporary, Buffon not, however, in the character of a rival of Linnasus.

--Each was a man of genius, each did good work in his own way work still

bringing forth fruit. It must be admitted, however, that they were men of

a very different stamp, and if it is necessary to express a relative judgment with
respect to them, I should myself feel inclined to say that Button's mind had the
greater aptitude for sagacious speculation, with an inferior power of acquiring and
arranging a knowledge of facts of structure.

      Various circumstances have concurred to favour our recollection of the merits
of the great Swede, and to obscure those of the French naturalist. The well-
earned fame of Linnaeus is kept ever fresh in our memories by the necessarily

frequent references to him in matters of nomenclature. On the other hand, not
only are Button's claims on our esteem in no similar way brought before us, but
those very speculative opinions of his, which are a merit in our eyes, have gained
him disfavour with our immediate predecessors, whose opinions and sentiments we
more or less inherit.

    No one, however, can dispute Button's title to our grateful respect on account

of the very powerful effect his writings had in stimulating men's love of nature,
an effect which I think is not sufficiently appreciated.

      It is fitting that I should call attention to his (once generally recognised) claims

in this respect; since my own love of natural history is probably due to the
circumstance that his great work was always accessible to me in my childhood,

and was one of the earliest books with the pictures of which I was familiar.
     Button was indeed Linnasus's contemporary, for the same year (1707) saw the

births of both. In 1733 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences,
and six years later was appointed superintendent of the Jardin du Roi, 1 which

     1 The Jardin du Roi was first instituted by Louis XIII. in 1628, and definitively

-- --established in 1635. It cannot be affirmed that Buffon enriched the incipient museum
   the Cabinet du Roi so much as might have been expected ; although the skeletons
which served for Daubenton's descriptions were, at least in many instances, preserved.
It is to Geoffroy St.-Hilaire that the magnificent museum of the Jardin des Plantes,
which now exists, is most indebted.

was the occasion of that work to which he is indebted for Lis fame, and to perfect
which he displayed so much zeal in collecting specimens and in obtaining informa-

tion respecting the various kinds of animals with which he became acquainted.
His Hist aire Naturelle yenerale et particulib-e began to appear in 1749, and in
1767 was published the fifteenth volume, which closed his history of mammals.
Herein are contained^ those numerous anatomical illustrations (due, with their

accompanying descriptions, to Daubenton) which have been again and again copied

down to the present time. Next came nine volumes on birds, then his history of

minerals, and, finally, seven supplementary volumes, the last of which appeared

in 1789, the year after his death. His life was thus prolonged ten years beyond

that of his illustrious contemporary, Linnaeus.

     Buffon can claim no merit as a classifier. With the exception of the Apes of
the old and new worlds (which respectively fill the fourteenth and fifteenth

volumes of his work), the beasts treated of are hardly arranged on any system,
beyond that of beginning with the best known and most familiar--a system

necessarily applicable to but a few forms.

     But Buffon deliberately rejected the Linnasan classification--a grave error,

certainly, yet one not altogether without excuse. Indeed, some of the objections
he brought against that classification have considerable force. Such were his

objections to the association of the hippopotamus, the shrew-mouse, and the horse

in one order, and of the monkey and the manis in another. 1 What indeed could

be more preposterous than the separation of the bat, Noctilio leporinus, from the
other bats, and its association with the rodents, on the ground of its having (as

--supposed) only two incisor teeth above and two below ? an anomaly of arrange-

ment of which you were reminded last year. It scarcely seems possible for the
pedantry of classification to go further than this. Yet, perhaps, the association

in one group of the walrus, the elephant, the ant-eater, the sloth, and the manatee,
was hardly less unphilosophical. Moreover, zoologists should not forget, in
blaming Buffon for his want of appreciation of the classification of Linnaeus, that
one great portion of that classification--the classification of plants--has been super-

seded by us.^ Had he lived to witness the publication of Jussieu's Genera Plan-

tarum? it might have given him a. truer insight into biological classification,
and have led him to endeavour to improve on Linnaeus' system instead of only

criticising it.

     But it is Buffon's speculative views which have most interest for us. Those
views exercised a very wide-spread influence in their day, though the time was not
ripe for them. Indeed, it is far from improbable that writers whose speculations
have been made public at a more propitious season, owe much to their comparatively

forgotten predecessor.

Amongst Buffon's various speculations we might glance at his Theorie de la terre

(put forth in the very first volume of his work), and at his Bpoques de la Nature,
Wewhich fills the fifth volume of his supplement.
                                                       might consider his speculations

concerning the formation of mountain and valley by water, and the evidence that

there was present to the ear of his imagination :

                   ' The sound of streams, which, swift or slow,
                    Tear down JSolian hills and sow
                    The dust of continents to be.'

That  he  saw, in  thought, the    projection of the planets from  the  sun's mass                                          the
                                                                                                                         ;

primitive fluidity of the earth, and the secular refrigeration of the sun. Such

considerations, however, are foreign to this Section. I will therefore select two
which are of biological interest.

    In the first place I may refer to Buffon's speculations concerning animal

variation. In this matter Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire has affirmed that Buffon

stands to the doctrine of animal variability in a position analogous to that in which

Linnseus stands to the doctrine of the fixity of species.

356 eepoet-- 1879.

    Buffon, in his chapter on the animals of the Old and New World, remarks, 1 * It
is not impossible that the whole 2 of the New World's animals are derived from the

same source as those of the old, whence they have descended.' . . . . ' Nature is

in a state of perpetual flux.' In his chapter on the Degeneration of Animals 3 he

sums up saying, ' After comparing all the animals, and arranging them each in

their own group, we shall find that the two hundred kinds described here may be
reduced to a small number of original forms, whence it may be all the rest have

issued.'

As to the modes and causes of the origin of new forms, he entertained four

connected opinions

(1) He attributed much modifying efficacy to migrations

(2) Also to the direct action of external conditions  ;

(3)       He believed largely in the origin of new forms by degradation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

(4) He regarded each animal as the manifestation of an individuating force,,

lying, as it were, at the root of the changes manifested by it.

The view that migration (with isolation) is a necessary antecedent to the origin

of new species is one which has been advocated by a modern naturalist, Moritz

Wagner; 4 who does not hesitate to affirm 5 that the formation of a really new

species ' will only succeed when a few individuals, having crossed the barriers of

their station, are able to separate themselves for a long time from the old stock.'
     In support of his view the author brings forward a multitude of interesting

facts, one of the most significant of which appears to me to be the following. It

concerns Beetles of Tropical America of the genus Tetracha. In Venezuela (as also

in the western part of Central America) , he tells us, rivers flow partly through
savannahs, where they have undermined the light tufaceous soil, forming deep beds
with high precipitous banks. According to Professor Wagner, individual beetles
from the highlands have thus been isolated, and in no longer time than has been
required by the rivers to undermine the loose soil of the savannah, have given rise

to a distinct species markedly different in form and colour. It is to similar causes

--migration and complete isolation that he traces the formation of distinct races of

men : a formation he deems no longer possible, while the wide diffusion of mankind
renders more and more difficult the evolution of new species of animals of any kind.

  --Instances which appear to support this view will readily suggest themselves to-

the naturalist instances, that is, of forms which are both pecidiar in structure and
remote and isolated as to their habitat. 6 Thus for example, even in the group which
structurally most resembles us, we have the Orang confined to very limited tracts
in Borneo and Sumatra, and the Gorilla to a small portion of Western Africa.
The Proboscis Monkey is found nowhere but in Borneo, while the singular ape
named 'Roxellana' (from its wonderfully 'tip-tilted' nose) is confined to the
lofty and isolated mountains of Moupin in Thibet. The very peculiar black ape
(Cynopithecus) is limited to Celebes and Batchian, while the Baboon, which has
the baboon character of muzzle most developed, was found at the extreme south of
the African continent.

    2 He thought, that the American Jaguars, Ocelots, &c, and even the Peccary,
were positive degradations of Old World forms. He thought that the Llama, the

American Apes, Agoutis, and Ant-eaters might be examples of such forms ; but the
Opossum, Sloths and Tapirs he took to be original species. (See vol. xiv.

    6 Isolation, it ought to be remembered, may take place as the result not only of

changes in inorganic nature (such as the formation of islands, and the excavation of
river beds), but also by the presence of enemies in intermediate tracts, by the cir-
cumstance that the food of the species is found only in certain restricted localities,
and by whatever other causes determine the extinction of a species in a given place.

    Again, if we take the group of Lemur-like animals (Lemuroidea) as having

--had their home and starting-point in or near their present head-quarters Mada-
--gascar then some of the most aberrant forms are those which must have migrated

farthest. The character which is perhaps the most peculiar of any which the group

presents, is the elongation of two of the ankle-bones, as we find it in the Mada-

gascar genus Cheirogaleus. But this character is more exaggerated in migrants to

-- --Africa the Galagos and most so of all in the more isolated emigrant, the Tarsier,

now found in Celebes and Borneo.

The sub-family of slow-lemurs (Nycticebinee) would, on this view, seem to

have migrated in opposite directions, as we find the slender slow-lemur {Loris) in

Madras,  Malabar, and  Ceylon                               the typical slow-lemur (Nyctieebus) in  South  China,
                                                         ;

Borneo and Java ; the Potto (Perodicticus) in Sierra Leone, and the Angwantibo

(Arctocebus) in Old Calabar. Of these, it is the African forms which have the

index-finger most atrophied--a tendency to its atrophy existing in the whole sub-

family.

It would, of course, be very easy to multiply instances of the kind ; but it would

be also easy to cite a number of cases which appear to conflict with the view in ques-

tion. Thus familiar to us as it is, few animals are more peculiar in structure than
the common mole, which gives no present evidence of isolated origin ; and the most
aberrant of all bats, the Vampire (Desmodu$),ia rather widely distributed in South

America. Again,' with regard to the Lemur group, the most absolutely exceptional

is the Aye-Aye (Cheiromys), which, on the hypothesis supposed, has remained per-

sistently at the head-quarters of the group, i.e. in Madagascar.

    Even, however, if no exception existed to the co-existence now of singularity
of form and isolation and remoteness of situation, we could not safely draw any

decided conclusion from such facts, because fossil remains show us that forms

which have now a very limited distribution, were either widely spread in ear-
lier times, or existed in regions very remote from those they now inhabit.

Thus, in Eocene times there existed in Europe true opossums (now confined

to America), Tapirs, and a form like the African Potto before mentioned. In

Miocene times we had in Europe long-armed apes (creatures now found only in

Eastern Asia), with the now exclusively African Secretary Bird and Cape Ant-

--Eater (Orycteropus). In the same period the Orang or a nearly allied form

seems to have ranged over India. What are more emphatically old-world forms

than the camel, horse and elephant, with the typical porcupine ? Yet all these

existed in America in Pliocene times. Did we know the Tapir in only one of the
two widely-separated stations in which it dwells to-day, we might well deem its
evolution to be due to migration and isolation. But we know from palaeontology

that it existed in Europe from the Eocene to the Pliocene period.
     Such facts as these do not, of course, disprove the doctrine that migration and

isolation are necessary antecedent conditions to specific genesis, but they show
how much caution must be used in drawing the conclusion that they are necessary,
from the distribution of animals much less likely to be found fossil than mammals are.

     But an argument in favour of the views of Buffon and of Wagner may be
obtained from our own species, which exhibits some singular coincidences between
peculiarity of form and isolation. Among such instances may be mentioned the
Tasmanians, the Andaman Islanders, and the Ainos or Aborigines of Japan. One

--of the most striking examples is that of the Eskimo a people presenting many

peculiarities, some of which exaggerate the characters of the highest races of man-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    _

kind. Thus, the pelvis differs from the European pelvis in an opposite direction to

that by which the Negro pelvis differs from the European, and the same is the case
with the proportions of the limbs, while the skulls of the Eskimo have the largest

and narrowest nasal aperture of all races, being in this respect the very opposite to

the Australians. The Eskimo have migrated eastwards, not reaching the south of
Greenland till the fourteenth century, and the race characters are most marked in
the most easterly tribes. These facts were brought forward by Professor Flower in
his Hunterian lectures for the present year,1 when he said that the characters of

     1 The lecturer also said : ' The large size of the brain of all the hyperborean races,
Lapps as well as Eskimo, seems not necessarily to be connected with intellectual
                                                                   ;

  this peculiar race ' must be attributed to those gradual modifications produced by-
  causes at present little understood, by which most of the striking variations met

 --with in the human species have been brought about modifications more strongly

  expressed the more completely isolated the race has become, and the farther

 removed from its original centre of distribution.' I think, then, that though we
 have not data for conclusively answering the question as to how far migration
  (together with isolation) may be necessary for specific genesis, it is certain that it

  is of very great efficacy and importance, and that credit is justly due to Buffon for

  his early appreciation of its importance.

       The next question to which I woidd advert is that concerning ttte direct
 ACTION UPON ORGANISMS, OF THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS WHICH SURROUND THEM.

       Buffon's belief was x that changes of specific form were brought about by change
  of temperature and climatic change generally, as well as by change of food.

    --The curious effects of stimulating food on colour as of cayenne pepper with
 --canaries, and hemp-seed with parrots are notorious. The direct action of the

 environment on organisms has, I think, been of late somewhat undervalued.
 Amongst evidences in favour of its importance, I would refer to some of Mr. Alfred

 Wallace's observations. 2 He tells us that in the small island of Amboina, the

 butterflies (twelve species, of nine different genera) are larger than those of any
 of the more considerable islands about it, and that this is an effect plainly due to
 some local influence. In Celebes, a whole series of butterflies are not only of a
 larger size, but have the same peculiar form of wing. The Duke of York's island
 seems, he tells us, to have a tendency to make birds and insects white or at least
 pale, and the Philippines, to develop metallic colours, while the Moluccas and

 New Guinea seem to favour blackness and redness in parrots and pigeons. Species

 of butterflies which in India are provided with a tail to the wing, begin to lose that

 appendage in the islands, and retain no trace of it on the borders of the Pacific.
 The ^Eneas group of Papilios never have tails in the equatorial region of the

 Amazon Valley, but gradually acquire tails, in many cases, as they range towards the

 northern and southern tropics. Mr. Gould says that birds are more highly coloured

--under a clear atmosphere than in islands or on coasts a condition which also seems

 to affect insects, while it is notorious that many shore plants have fleshy leaves.

 I need but refer to the English oysters mentioned by Costa, which, when trans-

 ported to the Mediterranean, grew rapidly like the true Mediterranean oyster, and
 to the twenty different kinds of American trees, said by Meehan to differ in the
 same, manner from their nearest European allies, as well as to the dogs, cats, and
 rabbits which have been proved to undergo modifications directly induced by-

 climatic change.

     It appeara then that much may be said in favour of that direct effect of sur-

 rounding circumstances on Organisms in which Buffon believed.

     Lastly, I would refer to Buffon's belief that new species have arisen by degra-

 dation. This again is an opinion which, after a period of disfavour, or at least of
neglect, has been of late revived, and has acquired considerable influence. I

may here refer to Anton Dohrn, who has recently advocated the very widely spread

and effective action of degradation as a cause of specific change. It will, I think,
be generally admitted that such exceptional Copepod crustaceans as Tracheliastes

and Lerneocera are due to degradation, and the probability seems to me very strong
that the Bhizocephala, at least many cirripeds, and the certoid worms, are also
degraded organisms. Very interesting would it be to know whether existing
Ascidians are also examples of degradation, as not a few zoologists now suppose

but most interesting of all is that parasite of cuttle fishes, Dicyema, the structure

of which has been recently investigated by Professor Edward Van Beneden, and
made the type of a new primary division of animals. Should this small worm-like
organism hereafter turn out to be a degraded form, it will show what an extreme

development, but may have some other explanation not at present apparent.' I

-- --would suggest that in this case as in the large brains of Cetaceans it may be due

to the need in their climate of generating much heat to sustain the necessary tem-

perature of the body.

degree of retrograde metamorphosis may occasionally be brought about. I think
then that we have considerable ground for suspecting that degradation has acted
much and widely in the field of Biology, and if so, Buffbn is fairly entitled to a

certain amount of esteem on account of the views he entertained with regard to it

in so early a day and in so undeveloped a condition of zoological science. For it

must not be forgotten that migration, the influence of external conditions, and

degradation, are connected points : parts of one view. Degradation is most con-

spicuous under violent changes of condition (such as parasitism), while migration

only acts by bringing organisms under new conditions.

    These reflections lead me to urge upon such of my hearers as may have any

unusual facilities for experimental investigation, a course of inquiry which seems

to be very desirable.

    What is needed in order to solve as far as possible the question of specific

genesis, is a knowledge of the laws of variation, which must, I think, be deemed the

true cause and origin of species.

   We may, I think, accept as true two propositions

    (1) Animals may change in various ways, and amongst them, by degradation.

     (2) Changes in the environment with isolation, induce and favour changes in

form.

I would urge then that inquiries should be pursued in two directions simul-

taneously.

(A) There might be undertaken one set of inquiries to investigate the effects

on different species of the same variations of environment.

     (B) Other inquiries might be undertaken with a view to ascertaining the effects

of different changes of environment on one and the same species. By series of

experiments contrived with these ends in view, and carried on with various

selected animals and plants which reproduce with rapidity, we may possibly be able

to determine what to attribute to external influences (shown by such influences

having the same effects on all), and what to the peculiar nature and innate powers

--and tendencies of different organisms shown by the diverging reactions of the

latter under the same changes in their environment.

     I next desire to direct your attention to another matter treated of by Buffon
I mean the resemblances and differences which exist between the mind

OF MAN AND THE HIGHER PSYCHICAL FACULTIES OF ANTMALS.

This question is eminently a question of our own day, and one which I feel

cannot but excite interest in this Section.

     But its accurate investigation is attended with special difficulties, and amongst
them are two temptations, which are apt to beset the inquirer

     (1) The first of these arises from the wide-spread love for the marvellous
of whatsoever kind, and the tendency to inverted anthropomorphism.

(2) The other is the temptation to strain or ignore facts to serve a favourite

theory.

As to the former of these dangers, I may perhaps be permitted to quote some

remarks made by Mr. Chambers, approvingly cited by Professor Bain : ' There are

two subjects where the love of the marvellous has especially retarded the progress
--of correct knowledge the manners of foreign countries, and the instincts of the
....brute creation
                    It is extremely difficult to obtain true observations ' as

to the latter ' from the disposition to make them subjects of marvel and astonish-

ment.' . . . . ' It is nearly as impossible to acquire a knowledge of animals

from anecdotes as it would be to obtain a knowledge of human nature from the

narratives of parental fondness and friendly partiality.' This I believe to be most

true, and that here the danger of mistaking inference for observation is exception-

ally great. The inquirer ought not to accept as facts marvellous tales without

criticism and a careful endeavour to ascertain whether the alleged facts are facts

and not unconscious fictions.

    As to the second danger, the lamented George Henry Lewes, whom no one can

suspect of any hostility to Evolution in its most extreme form, remarks (in his

posthumous work * just published) that the researches of various eminent writers

 on animal psychology have been ' biassed by a secret desire to establish the identity
 of animal and human nature,' and certainly no one can deny that those who do
 assert that identity are necessarily exposed to the temptation referred to. Of course
 persons who desire to disprove this identity are exposed to the opposite temptation
 but it cannot be maintained that there is evidence of Buffon having been influenced

 by any such desire.
     The obvious differences between the highest powers of man and animals have

 led the common sense of mankind to consider them to be of radically distinct kinds,
 and the question which naturalists now profess to investigate is whether this is so

 or not.

     But we may doubt, whether many who enter upon this inquiry do not enter
upon it with their minds already made up that no such radical difference can by any
 possibility exist. To admit it, they think, would be tantamount to admitting some

 non-natural origin of man, to accepting as a fact something not harmonising with

our views as to nature generally, leading to we know not what results. To

admit it, would be to deny the principle of continuity. There cannot, therefore,

be any essential difference between man and brute, and their mental powers must

be the same in kind. This, I think, is no unfair representation of the state of
mind in which this question is very likely to be entered upon at the present time.

Surely, however, if we profess to investigate a question, we ought in honesty to

believe that there is a question to investigate, or else leave the matter to others

and if evidence should seem to show that ' intellect' cannot be analysed into sense,

but is an ultimate, it ought to be accepted, at the least provisionally, as such, even

at the cost of having to regard its origin as at present inexplicable. Can we explain
the origin of ' motion ' ? But what rational man thinks of denying it on that
account ? Let us not reject anything, then, which may be evident, on account of

certain supposed speculative consequences.
     But that no such consequences as those referred to need follow from the ad-

mission of the radical distinctness of human reason, seems evident from the views
of Aristotle. He certainly was free from theological prejudices or predispositions,

and yet to his clear intellect the difference between the merely sentient and the
rational natures was an evident difference, and the facts which are open to our

observation are the same as those which presented themselves to his.
     To enter on this inquiry with any fair prospect of success, it is not only

necessary to guard against such temptations as these, but it is also necessary to be
provided with a certain amount of knowledge of a special kind ; namely, with a

clear knowledge of what our own intellectual powers are. I conceive that, great

as is the danger of exaggeration and false inference as to the faculties of animals,

the danger of misapprehending and underrating our own powers is far greater.
     Buffon held very decided views as to the distinctness of the mind of man

from the so-called minds of animals. But an ingenious and gifted writer, 1 who

has recently done good service in supporting Buffon's claims to greater considera-
tion than he commonly receives, has, nevertheless, done him what I believe to be
strange injustice in attributing to his great work an ironical character, and this in

spite of Buffon's own protest 2 against irony in such a work as his. I cannot venture

to take up your time with controversy on this subject ; but, apart from Buffon's

protest against ' Equivoque,' it is incredible to me that he should have carried on a

--sustained irony through so voluminous a work thus making its whole teaching

absolutely mendacious. One remark of Buffon's, which has been strangely misin-

terpreted by this writer, I shall have occasion to notice directly ; but I think it may

suffice to clear Buffon's character from the aspersion of his admiring assailant, to

point out that in the table of contents in the final volume of his ' History of

Mammals 3 (which table gives the pith and gist of his several treatises), he

distinctly affirms the distinctions maintained in the body of his work.
     The following were Buffon's views. In his ' Discourse on the Nature of

Animals,' 4 he says, ' Far from denying feelings to animals, I concede to them

 everything, except thought and reflection' .... 'they have sensations, hut no

 faculty of comparing them one with another, that is to say, they have not the

 power which produces ideas.' He is full of scorn * for that gratuitous admiration

 for the moral and intellectual faculties of bees, which Sir John Lubbock's excel-
 lent observations and experiments have shown to be indeed gratuitous. Speaking
 of the ape, most man-like (and so man-like) as to brain, he says 2 'II ne pense
 pas : y a-t-il une preuve plus 6vidente que la matiere seide, quoique parfaitement
 organise'e, ne peut produire ni la pensee, ni la parole qui en est le signe, a nioins
 qu'elle ne soit animee par un principe superieur ? 3 Buffon has been accused of
 vacillation with respect to his doctrines concerning animal variation, but no one
 has accused him of vacillation with respect to his views concerning reason and

 instinct.

     I come now to the passage which I said has been so strangely misunderstood.

 It is that in which he expresses his conviction that ' animals have no knowledge of
 the past, no idea of time, and consequently no memory.' But to quote this
 passage without explanation is gravely to misrepresent the illustrious French
naturalist. Buffon was far from ignoring, indeed he distinctly enumerates the
various obtrusive phenomena which often lead the vulgar to attribute, without
qualification, both knowledge and memory to brutes. But, in fact, he distinguishes
between 4 memory and memory. His words are : ' Si l'on a donn^ quelque
attention a, ce que je viens de dire, on aura deja senti que je distingue deux
especes de memoire infiniment differentes l'une de l'autre par leur cause, et qui
peuvent cependant se ressembler en quelque sorte par leurs effets; la premiere
est la trace de nos idees, et la seconde, que j'appellerais volontiers reminiscence 5
plutot que memoire, n'est que le renouvellement de nos sensations,' and he declares^6
true memory to consist in the recurrence of ideas as distinguished from revived

sensuous imaginations.

     This distinction is one which it is easy to perceive. That we have automatic
memory, such as animals have, is obvious ; but the presence of intellectual memory
(or memory proper) may be made evident by the act of searching our minds (so to
speak) for something which we know we have fully remembered before, and thus
intellectually remember to have known, though we cannot now bring it before our

imagination.

    As with memory, so with other of our mental powers, we may, I think, distinguish

between a higher and a lower faculty of each ; between our higher, self-conscious,

--reflective mental acts the acts of our intellectual faculty-- and those of our merely

sensitive power. This distinction (to which I have elsewhere 7 called attention) I
believe to he one of the most fundamental of all the distinctions of biology, and
to be one the apprehension of which is a necessary preliminary to a successful

investigation of animal psychology. It is, of course, impossible for us thoroughly

to comprehend the minds of dogs or birds, because we cannot enter into the actual
experience of such animals, but by understanding the distinction between our own
higher and lower faculties,8 we may, I think, more or less approximate to such

a comprehension.

     3 Mr. Butler cites objections brought forward in a certain passage (from pp.

30 & 31, vol. xiv.), as if they were Buffon's own. But they are the objections of an

imagined opponent whose views Buffon himself combats. It is worthy of note that

Buffon long anticipated our contemporaries with respect to man's place in nature

in so far as concerns his mere anatomy. For he did not hesitate to affirm that

the Orang differs less from us structurally than it differs from some other apes.

    It may, I believe, be affirmed that no animal but man bas yet been sbown to

exhibit true concerted action, or to express by external signs distinct intellectual

--conceptions processes of whicb all men are normally capable. But just as some

plants simulate the sense-perception, voluntary motions and instincts of animals,
without there being a real identity between the activities thus superficially similar,

so there may well be in animals actions simulating the intellectual apprehensions,
ratiocinations, and volitions of man without there being any necessary identity

between the activities so superficially alike. More than this, it is certain a p?-iori
that there must be such resemblance, since our organisation is similar to that of
animals, and since sensations are at least indispensable antecedents to the exercise
of our intellectual activity.

     I have no wish to ignore the marvellous powers of animals or the resemblance

of their actions to those of man. No one can reasonably deny that many of them
bave feelings, emotions and sense-perceptions similar to our own ; that they exercise

voluntary motion and perform actions grouped in complex ways for definite ends
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that they to a certain extent learn by experience, and can combine perceptions and
reminiscences so as to draw practical inferences, directly apprehending objects

standing in different relations one to another, so that, in a sense, they may be said

to apprehend relations. They will show hesitation, ending apparently, after a con-
flict of desires, with what looks like choice or volition, and such animals as the dog
will not only exhibit the most marvellous fidelity and affection, but will also mani-
fest evident signs of shame, which may seem the outcome and indication of incipient
moral perceptions. It is no great wonder, then, that so many persons, little given
to patient and careful introspection, should fail to perceive any radical distinctions
between a nature thus gifted, and the intellectual nature of man.

    But, unless I am greatly mistaken, the question can never be answered by our
observations of animals, unless we bear in mind the distinctions between our own

higher and lower faculties.

    Now I cannot here even attempt to put before you what I believe to be the

true view of our own intellectual processes. Still I may, perhaps, be permitted to
make one or two passing observations.

     Everybody knows bis own vivid feelings (or sensations), and those faint revivals
of feelings, simple or complex, distinct or confused, whicb are imaginations and

emotions ; but the same cannot be said as to thought. Careful introspection

will, however, I think, convince anyone that a ' thought ' is a thing widely different

--from an ' imagination ' or revival of a cluster of faint feelings. The simplest element

of thought seems to me to be a ' judgment,' with an intuition of reality concerning

some 'fact,' regarded as a fact real or ideal. Moreover, this judgment is not

itself a modified imagination, because the imaginations whicb may give occasion

to it persist unmodified in the mind side by side with the judgment they have called
up. Let us take, as examples, the judgments ' That tbing is good to eat,' and
' Nothing can be and not be at the same time and in the same sense.' As to th&
former, we vaguely imagine ' things good to eat,' but they exist beside the judgment,
not in it. They can be recalled, compared, and seen to co-exist. So with the other
judgment, the mind is occupied with certain abstract ideas though the imagination
has certain vague ' images ' answering respectively to ' a thing being ' and ' a thing
not being,' and to ' At the same time ' and ' in the same sense ; ' but the images
do not constitute the judgment itself any more than human ' swimming ' is made
up of ' limbs and fluid,' though without such necessary elements no such swimming

could take place.

     This distinction is also shown by the fact that one and the same idea may be
suggested to, and maintained in the mind by the help of the most incongruous
images, and very different ideas by the very same image. This we may see to be

the case with sucb ideas as ' number,' ' motion,' ' identity,' &c.

effects wrought on them in the past. But to call such action as that by which a tree as
it grows preserves the traces of scars inflicted on it years before, 'memory, 'is a gross

--abuse of language a use of the word as unreasonable as would be the employment

of the word ' sculptor ' to denote a quarryman, or ' sculpture ' to indicate the
fractures made in rocks by the action of water and frost.
                                --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. OF ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 363

    But the distinctness of ' thought ' from ' imagination ' may perhaps be made
clearer by the drawing out fully what we really do when we make some simple

judgment, as, e.g., that ' a negro is black.' Here, in the first place, we directly

and explicitly affirm that there is a conformity between the external thing, ' a

--negro,' and the external quality, ' blackness ' the negro possessing that quality.

We affirm secondarily and implicitly a conformity between the two external entities

and the two corresponding internal concepts. And thirdly, and lastly, we also

implicitly affirm the existence of a conformity between the subjective judgment

and the objective existence.

All that it seems to me evident that sentience can do, is to associate feelings and

images of sensible phenomena, variously related, in complex aggregations ; but not

to apprehend sensations as ' facts ' at all, still less as internal facts, which are the

signs of external facts. It may be conceived as marking successions, likenesses

and unlikenesses of phenomena, but not as recognising such phenomena as true.

Animals, as I have fully admitted, apprehend things in different relations, but no

one that I know of has brought any evidence that they apprehend them as related,
Aor their relations as relations.
                                                              dog may feel shame, or possibly (though I do not

think probably) a migrating bird may feel agony at the imagination of an abandoned

brood                           but these feeliDgs have nothing in  common        with an  ethical judgment,  such
                             ;

as that of an Australian, who, having held out his leg for the punishment of

spearing, judges that he is wounded more than his common law warrants.

Animals, it is notorious, act in ways in which they would not act had

they reason; while, as far as I have observed or read, all they do is

explicable by the association of sensations, imaginations, and emotions, such

Weas take place in our own lower faculties.                                       cannot, of course, prove a

negative, but we have no right to assume the existence of that for which there is

no evidence, without which all the facts can be explained, and which if it did

exist would make a multitude of observed facts impossible. Apes (like dogs and

cats) warm themselves with pleasure at deserted fires, yet, though they see wood

burning and other wood lying by, though they have arms and hands as we have

and the same sensient faculties, they have never, so far as I know, been recorded

to have added fuel to maintain their comfort. Swallows will continue to build on

a house which they see has begun to be pulled down, and no animal can be
shown to have made use of antecedent experience to intentionally improve upon

the past.

     If, on the other hand, animals were capable of deliberately acting in concert,
the effects would soon make themselves known to us so forcibly as to prevent

the possibility of mistake.

Mr. Lewes has not hesitated to affirm 1 that 'between animal and human

intelligence there is a gap which can only be bridged over by an addition from

without,' and he also says : - ' The animal world is a continuum of smells, sights,,

touches, tastes, pains, and pleasures : it has no objects, no laws, no distinguishable

abstractions, such as self and not self.'                                    'If we see a bud, after we have

learned that it is a bud, there is always a glance forward at the flower and back-

ward at the seed                           but what animal sees a bud at all except as a -visible sign

of some other sensation F ' As a friend of mine, Professor Clarke,3 has put it : 'In

ourselves sensations presently set the intellect to work ; but to suppose that they do

Aso in the dog is to beg the question that the dog has an intellect,                             cat to bestir

itself to obtain its scraps after dinner, need not entertain any belief that the clat-

tering of the plates when they are washed is usually accompanied by the

presence of food for it, and that to secure its share it must make certain move-

ments                           for quite  independently  of  such  belief,  and  by  virtue of  mere association,
                             ;

the simple objective conjunction of the previous sounds, movements, and consequent

sensations of taste, would suffice to set up the same movements on the present

occasion.' Let certain sensations and movements become associated, and then the
former need not be noted : they only need to exist for the association to produce its-

Wheneffects, and simulate apprehension, deliberation, inference, and volition. '

the circumstances of any present case differ from those of any past experience,

but imperfectly resemble those of many past experiences, parts of these, and

consequent actions, are irregularly suggested by the laws of resemblance, until

some action is hit' on which relieves pain or gives pleasure. For instance

let a dog be lost by his mistress in a field in which he has never been before. The

presence of the group of sensations which we know to indicate his mistress is
associated with pleasure, and its absence with pain. By past experience an asso-

ciation has been formed between this feeling of pain and such movements of the

head as tend to recover some part of that group, its recovery being again associated

with movements which, de facto, diminish the distance between the dog and his

mistress. The dog, therefore, pricks up his ears, raises his head and looks round.

His mistress is nowhere to be seen ; but at the corner of the field there is visible a

gate at the end of a lane which resembles a lane in which she has been used to

Awalk.  phantasm (or image) of that other lane, and of his mistress walking

there, presents itself  to the  imagination  of  the  dog                   he  runs  to  the present lane,
                                                                         ;

but on getting into it she is not there. From the lane, however, he can see a tree at

the other side of which she was wont to sit ; the same process is repeated, but she is

not to be found. Having arrived at the tree he thence finds his way home.' By the

--action of such feelings, imaginations, and associations which we know to be veree
--causes I believe all the apparently intelligent actions of animals may be explained

without the need of calling in the help of a power, the existence of which is in-

consistent with the mass, as a whole, of the phenomena they exhibit.

But if there is a radically distinct intellectual power or force in man, is such a

distinction of kind so isolated a fact as many suppose? May there not exist

between the forces which living beings exhibit other differences of kind ?

Each living being consists of an aggregation of parts and functional activities

which are evidently knit together into a unity. Each is somehow the seat or

theatre of some unifying power or condition which synthesises their varied activities,

and is a pkinciple of individuation. This seems certainly to have been the

opinion of Buffon, and it is to this opinion that I referred in speaking of the fourth

cause to which he attributed the changes in organic forms. And to me it seems

Wethat we must admit the existence of such a living principle.                            may analyse the

activities of any animal or plant, and by consideration of them separately find

resemblances between them and mere physical forces. But the synthesis of such

forces as we find in a living creature is certainly nowhere to be met with in the

inorganic world.

To deny this would be to deny the plainest evidence of our senses. To assert

that each living body is made up of minute independent organisms, each with its
own 'principle of individuation,' and without subordination or co-ordination, is

but to multiply difficulties, while such a doctrine conflicts with the evidence of our

--own perceptions, which lead each of us to regard himself as one whole a true

unity in multiplicity.                           .

The existence in each creature of a peculiar, co-ordinating, polar force, seems to

be specially pointed to by the phenomena of serial and bilateral symmetry, by the

symmetrical character of certain diseases, by the phenomena of monstrous growths,

and by the symmetrical beauty of such organisms as the Radiolarian Rhizopods.

    It also seems to me to be made evident, by the various activities of each animal,

which are, as a fact, grouped in one in mutual interaction-- an organism having

been described by Kant as a creature, the various parts of which are reciprocally

ends and means.

But consciously or unconsciously, general conceptions of the kind exist in the

minds of all biologists, and influence them in various ways, and their consider-

vinced I shall not be wasting your time in endeavouring to remove a wide-spread

misconception.

The ' Vitalism ' which is so reasonably objected to, is that which supposes the

existence in each living creature of some separate entity inhabiting the body
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. OF ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 365

--an extra-organic force within the living creature, and acting by and through

it, but numerically distinct from it. But the view which I venture to put before

you as that which is to my judgment a reasonable one, is that of a peculiar

form of force which is intra-organie, so that it and the visible living body are one

thing, as the impress on stamped wax and the wax itself are one, though we can

ideally distinguish between the two. It is, in fact, a mode of regarding living

creatures with prime reference to their activities rather than to their material

composition, and every creature can of course be regarded either statically or

dynamically. It is to regard any given animal or plant, not as a piece of complex

matter played upon by physical forces, which are transformed by what they

traverse, but rather as a peculiar immanent principle ' or form of force (whensoever

and howsoever arising), which for a time manifests itself by the activities of a certain

mass of complex material, with which it is so entirely one that it may be said to con-
stitute and be such animal or plant much rather than the lump of matter which we
can see and handle can be said to constitute such animal or plant. On this view a

so-called ' dead bird ' is no bird at all, save by abuse of language, nor is a ' corpse '

--really a ' dead man ' such terms being as self-contradictory as would be the

expression ' a dead living creature.'

Thus the real essence, the substantial constituent, of every living thing is

something which escapes our senses, though its existence and nature reveal them-

selves to the intellect.

For of course our senses can detect nothing in an animal or plant beyond the

qualities of its material component parts. But neither is the function of an organ
to be detected save in and by the actions of such organ, and yet we do not deny it

its function or consider that function to be a mere blending and mixture of the pro-

perties of the tissues which compose it. Similarly it would seem to be unreasonable to

deny the existence of a living principle of individuation because we can neither see nor

feel it, but only infer it. This power or polar force, which is immanent in each

living body, or rather which is that body living, is of course unimaginable by us,

since we cannot by imagination transcend experience, and since we have no experi-

ence of this force, save as a body living and acting in definite ways.

It may be objected that its existence cannot be verified. But what is verifica-

Wetion ?  often hear of ' verification by sensation,' and yet even in such verifica-

tion the ultimate appeal is not really to the senses, but to the intellect, which may

doubt and which criticises and judges the actions and suggestions of the senses and

imagination. Though no knowledge is possible for us which is not genetically

traceable to sensation, yet the ground of all our developed knowledge is not sensa-

tional, but intellectual, and its final justification depends, and must depend, not on

' feelings,' but on ' thoughts.' I must apologise to such an audience as that I have

the honour of addressing for expressing truths which, to some of my hearers, may
appear obvious. I would gladly suppress them as superfluous did not my own
experience convince me that they are not superfluous. To proceed : ' Certainty '

does not exist at all in feelings any more than doubt. Both belong to thought
only. ' Feelings ' are but the materials of certainty, and though we can be perfectly

certain about our feelings, that certainty belongs to thought and to thought only.

' Thought,' therefore, is our absolute criterion. It is by self-conscious thought only

     1 The word ' principle ' has been used to denote that activity which, together
with material substance, constitutes a riving creature, because that word calls up a
less sensuous, and therefore less misleading, phantasm than any other. The old term
^vxh, or soul, has in modern times come to be associated with the idea of a substance
numerically distinct from the living body, and capable of surviving the destruction
of the latter. But as structure and function ever vary together (as do the con-

vexities and concavities of a curved line), so ' the principle of individuation ' or
soul of an animal or plant and its material organisation must necessarily arise,
vary, and be destroyed simultaneously, unless some special character, as in the case

of man, may lead us to consider it exceptional in nature. Even in man, however,

there seems no adequate reason for believing in the existence of any principle of
individuation, save that which exerts its energy in all his functions, the humblest as
well as the most exalted.

that we know we have any feelings at all. Without thought, indeed, we might

feel, hut we could not know that we felt or know ourselves as feeling. If then

we have rational grounds for the acceptance of such a purely intellectual concep-

tion as that of an immanent principle as the essence of each living creature, the

Wepoverty of our powers of imagination should he no bar to its acceptance.  are
--continually employing terms and conceptions such, e.g., as ' being,' ' substance,'
--' cause,' &c. which are intelligible to the intellect (since they can be discussed),

though they transcend the powers of the imagination to picture.

It seems to me that the spirit which would deny such realities is the same spirit

which would deny our real knowledge of an external world at all, and represent any

material object as ' a state of consciousness,' and at the very same time represent ' a

--state ofconsciousness,' as the accompaniment of a peculiar state of a material object
   the body. 1 This mode of representation may be shortly, but not unjustly, described

as a process of intellectual ' thimble-rigging,' by which the unwary spectator is apt to

--be cheated out of his most valuable mental possession his rational certainty.

The same spirit asserts that our psychical powers never themselves enter into the

circuit of physical causation, and yet few things would seem more certain to a plain

man than that (supposing him to have received a message saying his house is on

fire) it is his knowledge of what has been communicated which sets him in motion.

To deny this is to deny the evident teaching of our consciousness. It is to deny

what is necessarily the more certain in favour of what is less so. If I do not know

this I know nothing, and discussion is useless. As a distinguished writer has said :
' That we are conscious, and that our actions are determined by sensations, emotions,

and ideas, are facts which may or may not be explained by reference to material

conditions, but which no material explanation can render more certain.' The advo-

Howcate of ' Natural Selection ' may also be asked,  did knowledge ever come to be,

if it is in no way useful, if it is utterly without action, and is but a superfluous

accompaniment of physical changes which would go on as well without it ?

As we may be confident that thought not only is but also acts, as well as that

there are things which are not psychical, but which are physical ; so I would urge

that the conception of living things, which I venture to put before you, is one

which may be rationally entertained.

Assuming for the moment and for argument's sake that it may be accepted,

what light does our knowledge of ourselves throw upon the intimate life-processes

Weof lower organisms ?        know that with us a multitude of actions, which are at

first performed with consciousness, come to be performed unconsciously ; we know
that we experience sensations a without perceiving them ; we know also that

countless organic activities take place in us under the influence and control of the

nervous system, which either never rise into consciousness at all, or only do so

under abnormal conditions. Yet we cannot but think that those activities are

of the same generic nature, whether we feel, perceive, or attend to them or

not. The principle of individuation in ourselves, then, evidently acts with intel-

ligence in some actions, with sentience in many actions, but constantly in an

unperceived and unfelt manner. Yet we have seen it undeniably intervene in the

chain of physical causation.

1 Those who deny that we have a real power of perceiving objects, refute them-

selves when they speak of 'purely physical changes,' or of anything 'physical' of

which feelings are but the ' accompaniment ' or ' subjects.' For according to them

'matter 'is but a term for certain 'states of consciousness,' while they represent each

state of consciousness as a function of matter. According to this, let a represent a

' state of consciousness, and b a physical state.' Then a sensation and its physical

accompaniment may be represented by the symbol a + b. But a physical state is

itself but a state of consciousness with its objective correlate, and is, therefore,

Wea + o.  thus get an equation infinitely more erroneous than b = a + b, because

the b of the a + b is itself ever again and again a + b.

2 As when having gazed vacantly through a window we revert to the pages of a

manuscript we may be writing and see there the spectra of the window bars we had

before unconsciously seen. Here the effect on the organism must have been similar

--to what it would have been had we attended to it i.e. it was an unfelt sensation.
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. OF ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 367

     An animal is an organism all the actions of which are necessarily determined

 by the adjustments of its various organs, and hy its environment. But even its

 sensations cannot be regarded as mere accompaniments of its activities, but as
 guides and directing agencies intervening in the circle of its actions, and as facts,

 in the chain of physical causation. The sight of a stick may change the course of

--actions which a dog would otherwise have pursued that is, the feeling of the

 moment, together with the faint recurrence of various past feelings and emotions

 therewith associated which the sight of the stick calls up, may cause such change.

 Besides its feelings, the general and the organic movements of the doo- are like

 our own, governed by a multitude of organic influences which are not° felt, but
 which operate through the nervous system, and so must be taken as parallel with
 those which are felt, i.e. as unfelt, nervous psychoses. The animal then, like

--each of us, is a creature of activities partly physical, partly psychical, the latter

 both the felt and the unfelt being directive and controlling.

     As we descend to the lowest animals, the evidence as to sentience fades. Yet

from the resemblances of the lowest animals and plants, and from the similarity of

the vegetative functions in all living creatures, we may, I think, analogically conclude

that activities also take place in plants which are parallel with, and analogous to

the unfelt psychoses of animals. As Asa Gray has said with respect to their

movements: 'Although these are incited by physical agents (just as analogous
kinds of movements are in animals), and cannot be the result of anything "like

volition, yet nearly all of them are inexplicable on mechanical principles. Some of
them at least are spontaneous motions of the plant or organism itself, due to some
inherent power which is merely put in action by light, attraction, or other external

influences.'

    I have already adverted to insectivorous plants, such as Dioncea. In such
Anplants we have susceptibilities strangely like those of animals.
                                                                                                                                                     impression

is made, and appropriate resulting actions ensue. Moreover, these actions

do not take place without the occurrence of electrical changes similar to
those which occur in muscular contraction. Hardly less noteworthy are the
curious methods by which the roots of some plants seek moisture as if by instinct
or thoseby which the tendrils of certain climbers seek and find appropriate support'
and having found it, cling to it by a pseudo-voluntary clasping, or, finally, those
by  which the
               little  ' Mother-of-a-thousand                                                                                                        explores surfaces for appropriate  hollows

in which to deposit her progeny.

      Nevertheless, nothing in the shape of vegetable nervous or muscular tissue has
been detected, and as structure and function necessarily vary together, it is impossible
to attribute sensations, sense-perceptions, instincts, or voluntary motions to plants
though the principle of individuation in each acts as in the unfelt psychoses of
animals and harmonises its various life processes.

     The conception then which commended itself to the clear and certainly
unbiassed. Greek intellect of more than 2,000 years ago, that there are three

orders of internal organic forces, or principles of individuation, namely, the rational

the animal, and the vegetal, 1 appears to me to be justified by the light of the
science of our own day.

    1 Difficult as it confessedly is to draw the dividing line between animals and
plants, such difficulty is not inconsistent with the existence of a really profound
difference between the two groups. That there should be a radical distinction of
nature between two organisms, which distinction our senses, nevertheless more or
less, fail to distinguish, is a fact which on any view must be admitted, since animals
of very different natures may be indistinguishable by us in the germ, and in the earlier
stages of their development. The truth of this is practically supported by the late Mr
Lewes, who says (as to the difference between the protoplasms from
and plants respectively arise) : ' That critical differences must exist is                                                                           which animals'

--368 report 1879.

I come now to the hearing of these remarks on the science of Biology generally.

Animals and plants may, as I have hefore said, he regarded either statically, hy

anatomy, or dynamically, hy physiology.

Physiology, as usually understood, regards the properties of the ultimate mor-

phological components of organisms, the powers of the various aggregations of

such components, i.e. of the various ' tissues ' and the functions of the different

special aggregations and arrangements of tissues which constitute ' organs.'

  --But as each living creature is a highly complex unity both a unity of body
--and also a unity of force, or a synthesis of activities it seems to me that we require

a distinct kind of physiology to be devoted to the investigation of such syntheses

of activities as exist in each kind of living creature. I mean to say that just as

we have a physiology devoted to the several activities of the several organs, which
activities are the functions of those organs, so we need a physiology specially

directed to the physiology of the living body considered as one whole, that is,

to the power which is the function, so to speak, of that whole, and of which the

whole body, in its totality, is the organ.

In a word, we need a physiology of the individual. This science, however,

needs a distinct appellation. I think an adequate one is not far to seek.

    Such a line ef inquiry may be followed up, whatever view be accepted

as to the nature of those forces or activities which living creatures exhibit.

But if we recognise, as I myself think our reason calls on us to recognise, the

existence in each living being of such a ' principle of individuation ' as I have advo-

cated the recognition of, then an inquiry into the total activity of any living

being, considered as one whole, is tantamount to an inquiry into the nature of

--its principle of individuation. Such an inquiry becomes ' Psychology ' in the widest

and in the original signification of that term it is the Psychology of Aristotle.

Mr. Herbert Spencer has already made a great step towards reverting to this

orioinal use of the term, for he has made his ' Pyschology ' conterminous with the

animal kingdom, having made it a history of the psychoses of animals. Bat the
Aactivities of plants must not be ignored.
                                                      science which should include the

impressionability and reactions of a Rhizopod, and exclude the far more striking

impressionability and reactions of Venus's Fly-trap, and of other insectivorous

plants, the recognised number of which is greatly on the increase, must be a very
partial and incomplete science. If Psychology is to be extended (as I think Mr.
Spencer is most rational in extending it) to the whole animal kingdom, it must
be made to include the vegetable kingdom also. Psychology, thus understood, will
be conterminous with the whole of Biology, and will embrace one aspect of organic
dynamics, while physiology will embrace the other.

     Physiology will be devoted (as it is now) to the study of the activities of

tissues, of organs and of functions, per se, such, e.g., as the function of nutrition,

as exhibited in all organism from the lowest plants to man, the functions of
respiration, reproduction, irritability, sensation, locomotion, &c, similarly con-

sidered, as manifested in the whole series of organic forms in which such powers

may show themselves.

     Psychology will be devoted (according to its original conception) to the study
of the activities of each living creature considered as one whole--to the form, modes,

and conditions of nutrition and reproduction as they may coexist in any one plant ; to
these as they may coexist with sensibility and motility in any kind of animal, and

finally to the coexistence of all these with rationality as in man, and to the inter-

actions and conditions of action, of all these as existing in him, and here the science

absent from animals. Such facts imply differences in elementary composition;
and this result is further enforced by the fact that when the two seem to resemble,
they are still different. The plant protoplasms form various cells, but never form a
                                      fibres, but                    elastic tissue                                                          tubes, but

never  a   nerve  tube ;  vessels,    but  never   a  vessel  with   muscular coatings                                                                                                         solid

" skeletons," but always from an organic substance {cellulose'), not from phosphates

identical ; we can only point throughout the two kingdoms to a great similarity
accompanying a radical diversity.'--(The Physical Basis of Mind, p. 129.)

which corresponds to the most narrow and restricted sense of the word, psycho-

logy, i.e. the subjective psychology of introspection, will find its place.

Psychology in the widest sense of the term, in its oldest and in what I believe

will be its ultimate meaning, must necessarily be, as to its details, a science of the

future. For just as physiology requires as a necessary, antecedent condition, a know-

--ledge of anatomy since we must know that organs exist before we investigate what
--they do so psychology requires as a necessary, antecedent condition, an already ad-

vanced physiology. It requires it because we must be acquainted with the various

functions, before we can study their synthesis and interactions.

When, however, this study has advanced, one most important result of that

advance will be a knowledge, more or less complete, of the innate powers cf

organisms, and therefore of their laws of variation. By the acquisition of such
knowledge we shall be placed in a position whence we may advance, with some

--prospects of success, to investigate the problem of the ' Origin of Species ' the

biological problem of our century.

    This reflection leads me back once more to my starting point, the merits of the

great French naturalist of the last century, whose views as to variation, and as to

animal psychosis, have enabled me to bring before you the questions on which I have

presumed to enter. Buflbn's claims on our esteem have, I think, been too much for-

mygotten, and I rejoice in this opportunity of paying  debt of gratitude to him by

recalling them to recollection. As to the questions which his words have suggested

to me and upon which I have thus most imperfectly touched, the considerations I have

ventured to offer may or may not commend themselves to your approval ; but, at
least, that they are the result of not a few years of study and reflection, and I am

persuaded they have consequences directly or indirectly affecting the whole field of

biological inquiry, which belief has alone induced me to make so large a call upon

your patience and your indulgent kindness.

                   By Sir John Lubbock, Bart., V.P.B.8., M.P.

     Sir John called the attention of the Section to the occurrence in England of
Leptodora hyalina, a very interesting crustacean first found in deep lakes abroad,
and more recently in a reservoir near Birmingham. It was forwarded to him by
Mr. Bolton. Like many marine organisations it was as transparent as glass. This
rendered the creature less conspicuous to its foes. Like other animals of the same
group it laid two kinds of eggs. The young produced from these two kinds of eggs
were said to differ from one another, but this he had had no opportunity of verify-

ing. He then entered into a description of the little animal, and by means of

sketches illustrated the peculiar functions of the different organs, pointing out the
difference of the organs in male and female.

The following Papers were read :

                              1. On Fruits and Seeds.
    By Sir John Lubbock, Bart., V.P.R.S., M.P., D.C.L., LL.D.

Sir John commenced by calling attention to the difference presented by seeds,

some being large, some small, some covered with hooks, some provided with hairs,

some smooth, some sticky, &c, and after observing that there were reasons for all

these peculiarities, proceeded to attempt to explain some of the more striking. In
the first place, he said, many seeds required protection from birds and insects.

Hence the shells or husks of the beech, Spanish chestnut, horse chestnut, walnut,

&c. In some cases, as in the common Herb Robert, the calyx or outer envelope of

the flower opens when the flower expands, closes over the seeds when the flower

fades, and opens again when the seeds are ripe. In other cases the flower-stalk

changes its position. Thus, in the Dandelion, it is upright when the flower is

expanded, lies close to the ground after the flower has faded, and rises again when

the seeds are ripe. In the Cyclamen, again, the flower-stalk curls itself up into a

spiral after the flower has faded,

    He then called attention to the modes of dispersion, by means of which seeds

secure a sort of natural rotation of crops, and are also in other cases enabled to

rectify their frontiers. Some plants actually throw their seeds. Thus, in the

common Cardamine, the outer membrane of the pod becomes very tense, and when

ripe, at the least touch it gives way at the base, and curling up with a spring,

throws the seeds three or four feet. The common geraniums and A-iolets also throw

their seeds, and so do some of the cucumbers ; but in these cases the mechanism is dif-

ferent. He then described the curious l elaters ' of the equisetums, and other means of
dispersion possessed by seaweeds and other low organised plants. Among the higher
plants the seeds are in many cases transported by the wind. Sometimes, indeed,

the whole plant is thus blown about, as in the case of the celebrated Rose of

Jericho, an annual, inhabiting the sandy plains of Palestine, Syria, and Arabia,

which, when dry, curls itself up into a ball, and is thus blown over the surface of
the ground till it comes to a damp place, when it uncurls, the pods open and shed

their seed.

    Many seeds are provided with a wing which catches the wind and thus aids in

dispersion. Such seeds occur, especially on trees, such as the pine, fir, ash, maple,

sycamore, hornbeam, and many exotic species. In these cases the seeds are large,
but many herbs have small seeds, provided with foliaceous expansions serving the

same purpose. These are sometimes so thin as to be transparent, and in Thysano-
carpus elegans the membrane is even perforated by a series of holes. In other

cases the seeds are provided with hairs, which catch the wind, sometimes forming

exquisite fairy parachutes. Such, for instance, are the dandelion, &c; but it is

curious that very different parts of the plant are modified into these hairs. Thus

in the dandelion and valerian it is the calyx ; in the bulrush, the perianth, in the

willow herb,  the  crown  of the  seed                    in cotton grass,  the base.  In the true cotton
                                                       ;

the whole seed is covered with hairs. Thus, then, although the result is the same,

the mode of arriving at it is very different.

He then proceeded to the cases in which the dispersion of seeds is effected

by the agency of animals. In many cases the seed is surrounded by a sweet,

fleshy pulp, which is eaten, while the true seeds, being surrounded by a tough
    --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 371

shell, remain undigested. Such fruits are generally brightly coloured, such as
the strawberry, peach, apple, currant, &c; the colours, like those of flowers,
serving to attract animals. In other cases the action of animals is involuntary.

These may be divided into two classes, those in which the seeds adhere to animals
by hooks, and those in which this is effected by sticky glands. Various cases of

both were cited, and specimens shown, especially the South African Harpagophyton,
a plant whose seeds are provided with terrible hooks, more than an inch long.
These seeds are said sometimes even to destroy lions ; they roll about over the
sandy plain, and if one attaches itself to the skin the wretched animal tries to tear
it off, and getting it into its mouth, perishes miserably. Sticky seeds- are also thus

transported.

     The next point is that seeds'should find themselves in a spot suitable for growth.
Most seeds, we know, germinate on the ground : the mistletoe, however, is parasitic
on trees, and its seeds are imbedded in a viscid substance, so that if dropped by a
bird on a bough it adheres to it, and is in no danger of being blown or washed off.

An allied species described by Sir J. Hooker, which lives on the beeches of Tierra
del Fuego, has four long feathery, flexible appendages. By means of them it is

blown from tree to tree, and as soon as the seed touches a twig the appendages
twine round it and thus anchor the seed.

     In some case3 plants bury their own seed. This, for instance, is the case with
our subterranean clover, and the ground-nut of the West Indies. In both cases the

seed-stalk elongates, curves downwards, and forces the seed into the ground. In
other instances the seed buries itself, as in some grasses and the Crane's Bills {Ero-
dium). The seed of Stipa, for instance, is pointed, and clothed with short, re-
versed hairs. It terminates in a spiral appendage, covered with similar hairs. Now,
if one of these seeds is laid on the ground, it remains quiet as long as it is dry, but

as soon as it is damp the hairs on the seed commence to move outwards, g-radually
raising the seed into an upright position, with its point downwards. The spiral
appendage then begins to unwind, and if its hairs come in contact with any ob-
stacle, such as a leaf, twig, &c, as is most probable, the seed is then forced into
the ground. Sir John, in conclusion, called attention to mimicking seeds. The

pods of Scorpiurus, for instance, a plant allied to the vetch, do not open, but they

look so exactly like worms that birds are probably induced to peck at them and

thus free the seeds.

2. On the Insects tvhich Injure Boohs. By Professor Westwood, M.A.

Referring to an address delivered by Dr. Hagen, of Harvard College, Mass.,

U.S., on July 2, 1870, before the American Library Association on the same sub-

ject, Professor Westwood passed in review the life-history of the different species

of insects which have been found to destroy books and printed papers, several of
which were not noticed by Dr. Hagen in his address.

The caterpillars of the moth Aglossa pinguinalis, and also of a species of

Depressaria, often injure books by spinning their webs between the volumes,

Agnawing small portions of the paper with which to form their cocoons.  small

mite {Cheyletus eniditus) is also found occasionally in books kept in damp situa-

tions, where it gnaws the paper.

   A very minute beetle (Sypothenemus eruditus, Westw.) forms its tinv burrows

within the binding of books, of which a small portion, with specimens of the

beetles, was exhibited.

The small silvery insect (Lepisma saccharina) found in closets and cupboards

where provisions are kept, also feeds on paper, of which a curious example was

exhibited in a framed and glazed print, of which the plain portion was eaten,

whilst the parts covered by the printing-ink were untouched. The Professor had

been assured that the same fact had been observed in India, where some of the
Government records had been injured in the same manner. This habit of the
Lepismse had not been previously recorded.

The white ants (Termitidce) are a constant source of annoyance in hot and

warm climates, eatiug all kinds of objects of vegetable origin, of which several

instances were recorded by Dr. Hagen, including tbe destruction of a stock of

Bibles and prayer-books, and the professor exhibited a small Bible which had been

greatly gnawed by these insects. Cockroaches {Blatta orientalis) are also equally

destructive to books when they fall in their way, of which some sad instances were

recorded by Dr. Hagen.

But it is the Death-watches (Anohium pertinax and striatum) which do the

greatest injury, gnawing and burrowing not only in and through the bindings, but

also entirely through the volume, and instances have been recorded where not

fewer than twenty-seven folio volumes placed together on a book-shelf had been so

cleanly drilled through by the larva of this beetle that a string might be run

through the hole made by it and the volumes raised by the string.

Various remedies for the destruction of these insects were mentioned, and

especial notice was directed to a ' Report of the Commission appointed to inquire

into the causes of the decay of wood carvings (by tbe Anobia), and the means of

preventing and remedying the effects of such decay,' issued by the Science and Art

Department of the Committee of Council on Education at South Kensington in

1864, in which Report the Professor gave an account of the life-history of the

Anobia.

Reference was also made to a previous Parliamentary Report on the National

Gallery, with the observations thereon by the late Dr. Waagen, especially with

reference to the state of Sebastian del Piombo's picture of the Raising of Lazarus,

which had been attacked by the Anobia. The Arabic MSS. in the Cambridge

Library, brought from Cairo by Burckhardt, and various Oriental MSS. in the

Bodleian Library, had been much injured by these insects.

The remedies against the attacks of the Anobiuni upon objects of carved wood

must necessarily be of a different character from those used against the book-worms,

which are the larvte of the Anobia. In the former case, saturation with chloride

of mercury dissolved in methylated spirits of wine or other analogous fluid had

been found to be efficient, but with respect to books it was necessary to have re-

course to vaporisation, and experiments were recorded in which objects attacked

by the Anobia had been placed in a large glass-case made as air-tight as possible,

and small saucers with pieces of sponge saturated with carbolic acid were placed

at the bottom of the case, and on the recommendation of the Professor it had been

found successful to place the infected volumes in the Bodleian Library in a closed

Abox with a quantity of benzine in a saucer at the bottom.  strong infusion of

colocynth and quassia, chloroform, spirits of turpentine, expressed juice of green

walnuts, and pyroligneous acid have also been employed successfully. Fumigation on

a large scale may also be adopted by having a room made as air-tight as possible,

burning brimstone in it, or filling the room with fumes of prussic acid or benzine.

Lastly, Dr. Hagen suggested that by placing an infected volume under the bell-

glass of an air-pump and extracting the air, the larvse would be found to be killed

after an hour's exhaustion.

     4. On Budding in the Syllidian Annelids, chiefly with reference to a
branched form procured by H.M.S. ' Challenger.' By W. C. McIntosh.

Propagation by budding is a prevalent feature amongst the Ccelenterata, the

organisms assuming in many cases a dendritic appearance, so that the name of sea

trees given to them by our fishermen is by no means inappropriate to their external
Acontour.
           similar condition is seen in many of the Polyzoa, and in the creeping

stolons of Clavelina and Perophora. In the sub-kingdom Vermes, again, naturalists

have long been familiar with a mode that has been called propagation by division

or Fissiparous development. Thus 0. F. Miiller describes two kinds of budding in

the freshwater Nats proboscidea,&nd gives an account of the same process in Nereis pro-

lifera (the Autolytus prolifera of modern authors). Amongst others, De Quatrefages

and Frey and Leuckart in the same species, Milne Edwards in Myrianida, Sars and

Huxley in Filigrana, 0. Schmidt in Nais, Microstoma, and Filigrana, Max Schultze,

R. Leuckart, and Tauber in the former species, Alex. Agassiz in Autolytus cornutus,

Schmarda in Catenula, and Lankester in Chcetogaster, show how widely this mode

of development has been recognised. The feature that mainly concerns us at

present in regard to these descriptions is the fact that a new animal is produced, in

a Hue with the old, by various modifications of budding. In no instance is there

any approach to a branched condition by lateral offshoots from either parent-stock

or bud. As an example of one of the best-known marine forms the account of

Autolytus cornutus by Alex. Agassiz may be cited. This species exhibits a kind of

alternation of generation, the parent-stock (which is a sexual) giving rise posteriorly

to male and female buds, which differ much in appearance from each other. The

latter produce ova, which by and by develop, in the peculiar body sac, into a swarm

of parent-stocks with which the cycle commenced.

The discovery of a species (Syllis ramosa) of the same family (Syllida) which

forms an intricate series of branches by lateral budding of the parent-stock, by Sir

'Wyville Thomson in a Hexactinellid sponge from Zebu, is one of the remarkable

additions to our knowledge made by the voyage of H.M.S. ' Challenger.'

The Syllidian 1 is located for the most part in the basal canals of the sponge,

above the ' wisp.' In this region masses of the annelid about a quarter of an inch

in diameter occur, and a multitude of branches pass into the smaller canals adjoin-

ing. Two of such masses are especially conspicuous. The intricate manner in

which the branches are arranged makes it a very difficult matter to dissect them

out, especially when the friability of the annelid and the sharp spicules of the

sponge are taken into account. Even after removal from the sponge it is a laborious

operation to unravel them without frequent rupture.

     The masses and their numerous branches, as well as the isolated portions, con-

sist of a Syllis-like annelid of the thickness of common sewing-thread. No head

can be observed either in the parent-stock amongst the masses or in the canals-

elsewhere, so that they must either be very few, only occasionally developed, or by

some means have been swept off, as it is hard to believe that they are entirely

absent. The latter, however, must be the condition in some of the examples (un--

less we are to suppose that all are connected with a single head), which, therefore,
would appear to derive nourishment at the open end, yet in many the aperture

rapidly develops a bud which nearly closes it. If* in life there are many examples

with such open ends, then the whole series branching from them presents an analo-

gous condition to that of very elementary animals, the food being swept in with

the sea-water to traverse the moniliform nutritive canal throughout the organism.

The body of the animal stretches, from any of the broken ends, of a nearly

uniform diameter for a considerable distance, the numerous narrow segments being

distinctly marked, and each furnished laterally with well-formed feet. The latter

have dorsally a long and ofteu gracefully curved cirrus, composed of a variable

number of segments, since injury and reparation constantly occur; moreover the

cirri are alternately long and short. The longer cirri have about twenty-six seg-

ments, and all the organs are gently tapered from base to apex. Beneath and-

confluent with the base of the cirrus is the somewhat conical setigerous region,

which has a few simple bristles, with a stout and slightly curved shaft, the dilated

distal portion having the simple terminal process apparently anchylosed to it.

AThis modification of the bristle is peculiar.    single stout spine supports the

setigerous region, and, as usual, its point passes to the upper border. The ventral

cirrus is broad and short, its tip being within the vertical line of the former division.

  --The body of the annelid appears to have a furor for budding laterally, termin-

ally, and wherever a broken surface occurs. The young buds remain slender till

they have reached a considerable length, and into each a diverticulum of the ali-

mentary canal of the parent enters. These buds, on attaining a certain size, by

1 See forthcoming Proceedings of the Linnaan Society, ' Zoology,'
374 report-- 1879.

and by give off other buds, so that the whole has a remarkably branched condition.
The tail of the bud (i.e. its distal point) is early formed, and soon becomes fur-
nished with two long cirri. Indeed, it would seem that in such a case the tail
and the anus were more useful than the head, the eyes, and the finished buccal
and pharyngeal apparatus.

     The number of buds seems to be indefinite, the data at present being insufficient

to enable me to fix a limit. Some of the larger fragments show nine or ten buds,

yet they are evidently far from being complete. The absence of a head leaves
great uncertainty on the latter point, and, if it existed at all, it could only have
been in the siliceous stem of the sponge, which had been torn off.

    Two female buds were found. One of these was still attached by its pedicle of

four segments to the parent-stock. These intermediate segments somewhat resem-
bled those of ordinary buds, only they were more slender. All had rudimentary
lateral cirri and setigerous processes. The diverticulum of the alimentary canal
proceeded from the main trunk in the ordinary way, passed through the anterior
segments of the bud, and became lost in the opacity caused by the ova. The head
of the bud is bilobate, and furnished dorsally with a large reddish-brown eye on
each side, and a still larger pair, of similar shape (somewhat circular) and colour, on
the ventral surface. These eyes, while useful for both dorsal and ventral vision,
approach so near the margins that they are also available for lateral sight. The head
terminates laterally in two short cirri and a setigerous process furnished with a spine.

     The body of the female bud is somewhat fusiform, gradually increasing in

diameter till full breadth is attained, and, after a nearly cylindrical region, dimi-

nishing towards the tail, though to a less degree than anteriorly. The entire body,
from the middle of the second segment backwards, as well as the bases of the feet,
is filled with ova, which in each case shows germinal vesicle and spot. The
anterior segments are provided with bristles of the same type as the parent-stock,
only the terminal appendage is more differentiated. None of the long simple
bristles are apparent in this fragmentary example.

      Exactly opposite the point from which the pedicle of the foregoing bud sprang
 is another small bud, consisting of upwards of a dozen segments. Moreover, in the
 same specimen a pair of young buds occur opposite each other. In these cases the
 segment of the intestine of the parent-stock, from which the diverticulum proceeds,
 is shorter than the rest. It would seem that the bud arises opposite a foot, and
 there is no evidence that a bud ever arises between two (successive) feet. The

 shortening of the intestinal segment may be due to the appropriation of the sub-
 stance of both it and the body-wall in the production of the new bud.

    A free female bud, again, occurred in one of the basal canals of the sponge. It

  closely agrees with the description of the foregoing specimen, except in the larger
  garnet-tinted eyes, and the presence of beautiful tufts of long simple bristles in each
  foot. Its length is about 9 mm., and its breadth, including the latter, is rather

  more than 2 mm. There are twenty-nine segments ; but the condition of the tail

  is open to doubt. Dorsally each segment has a slender and distinctly-jointed cirrus.
  Beneath the foregoing is a dense tuft of long translucent simple bristles, with broad

  flattened tips, after the fashion of the straight Roman swords, but marked at the

  tip by two peculiar longitudinal processes, and sometimes the end assumes a fim-
  briated appearance. The setigerous region beneath is short and conical, having
  superiorly the spine and inferiorly the bristles, which differ from those of the parent-
  stock, in showing a more evident differentiation at the junction of the terminal
  process. Ventrally is a tongue-shaped cirrus, which nearly reaches the tip of the
  setigerous region. The entire body is filled with ova, which likewise occupy the
   feet, almost to their tips ; the first segment and the extremity of the tail (which is
  apparently in process of regeneration) alone being devoid of them. Some of the
   feet, indeed, aasume a bulk four or five times larger than the others, from distention
   with ova. The latter, apparently, have embryos internally.

       Amongst the tangled masses in the channels of the sponge was a fragment of
   the posterior end of a form which differed from either of the foregoing. The feet,
   which are well-marked and long, have dorsally a slightly convex margin ; ventrally
  the outline is also somewhat convex at the base, but curves upward toward the
                                                                                                           --

Atip. short cirrus of four or five segments extends from the extremity of the

dorsal margin, while beneath it is a dense tuft of long straight sword-shaped trans-
Alucent bristles, similar to those described in the female bud.

the middle of the bristle-bundle, shows that part of the foot to which the tip of the

slender supporting spine proceeds. This slender spine diverges upward from the

side of the stronger inferior one, the arrangement of the parts indicating that the

Aforegoing tuft of simple bristles is of less morphological value than the others.

somewhat lanceolate process occurs at the ventral margin of the foot, and apparently

corresponds to the setigerous division. It is supported by the stronger spine, and

bears two or three bristles, with simple terminal processes, similar to those in the

parent-stock. No ventral cirrus is present. The body contains a large number of

granules, and also masses of what appear to have been fully-formed spermatozoa.

Whether this is the male of the above form or another is, of course, an open ques-

tion but the bristles certainly correspond.

their localities. After treating on the work of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union,

'2. On the Embryology of Gymnadina conopsea. By H. Marshall Ward.

The ovule arises on the placenta as a mass of cells consisting of an axial row,

surrounded by an epidermal layer of cells one deep : the terminal cell of the axial

row, just beneath the epidermal layer, enlarges and cuts off two cells at its apex

as described by Strasburgher ; these cap-cells and the epidermal cells become flat-

tened and finally destroyed as the cell which remains enlarges and becomes the

embryo sac. The existence of the remains of the cap-cells as refractive masses

above the embryo sac is cited as evidence against Vesque's view as to the origin

of the embryo sac by the fusion of two or more superposed cells. The protoplasm

in the embryo sac then divides into two masses, one passing to each end of the

sac              they there undergo further division into fours.                                                                     Of the four nucleated masses
              ;
376 RETORT-- 1879.

in the anterior part, one becomes the egg-cell, attached to two others, which have
elongated as the ' Gehiilfinnen ' or ' Synergidfe ' of Strasburgher, and become
packed into the top of the sac ; the fourth remains suspended in the protoplasm of
the sac, and is said by Strasburgher to fuse with one of the similarly produced
masses below, the product becoming the nucleus of the embryo sac. The three
remaining nuclei are the ' antipodal cells ' of authors. The writer confirms these
views, except that the actual blending of the two nuclei has not been seen : in
Ranunculus, Anthericurn, and other plants, however, the evidence is sufficient to
render this view most likely, since two nuclei in all stages of approach occur, as
well as sacs with one large central nucleus.

     The fertilised ovum divides by a horizontal wall into two similar cells ; the

upper one becomes the suspensor, and divided by cross-walls only ; the lower is cut
by walls in alternating planes at right angles to one another into a few-celled simple
embryo, showing no differentiations into tissues, or into cotyledons, stem, root, &c.
Short reference was made to the proposed homologies for these structures in the
embryo sac, and especially to the reasons against accepting the older views as to
the correspondence between the synergidae and the canal-cells of the archegonium.

     Confirmatory results have also been obtained in Butomus, Ranunculus, Alisma,
Anthericurn, and others. The views of Vesque do not appear to be supported by

these researches ; and those of Warming appear to involve considerable difficulties

as to the meaning of the embryo sac nucleus.

         3. On the Homologies of the Cephalopoda. By J. F. Blake.

     The flexure of the intestine in Cephalopoda and Pteropoda is ' pedal,' and that
of other Odontophora, ' cephalic ; ' and the body of a cephalopod must be placed
with the mantle cavity horizontal for comparison with a gastropod. The arms are
not homologous with the foot, but form an ' antivelum.' The labial and tentacular
processes, and not the individual tentacles of a Nautilus are shown to be homo-
logous to the arms of an Octopod. The hood is associated with the aptychus of the
Ammonite, the shell of an Argonaut, and the neckplates of a Sepia. The Ascoceras
is cited to show the relations of the Sepia-bone to the Nautilus shell.

             4. On Cyclops. By Marcus M. Hartog, M.A., B.Sc.

     The nervous-cord of Cyclops is essentially Copepodan in type, it is not distinctly
ddated into special ganglia containing cells evenly distributed up to the third thoracic
segment, which is here continued by a fibrous commissure to a ganglion in the next
segment. Beyond this are no cellular elements in the cord, which bifurcates in the
second abdominal segment, and the branches terminate in the furca. The sensory
and motor nerves appear to be wholly distinct, the latter coming off at a higher or

deeper level. All the sensory nerve-fibres pass through a bipolar ganglion cell near
their distal termination. Minute rounded spaces in the hypoderm, especially one at
the base of the last thoracic limb, and a pair on either side of the upper face of the
front of the head, appear to be auditory organs (containing one or more minute,
irregular, highly-refractive corpuscles in the male). Respiration in Cyclops is

entirely anal.

     The author points out the importance of rnaMng an examination of the animal
in many genera of the Helicidre, and thus obtaining better characters for specific
distinction than are often presented by the shell alone. The organ first discovered
and described by Lister in 1G94 is treated of, and the views of later naturalists
filluded to. Many different forms of the Spermatophore found in Helices from
Eastern Asia are shown, and the position of the organ in the generative system
of Helicarivn magnified from Burmah is described.

     The above will sufficiently illustrate the effects of the frosts in two severe

winters.

     It is worthy of remark that instead of the cold killing the slugs and various

pests of plants, they were never known so numerous. Many hardy plants, in pots,
were killed, such as Ivy, Pteris aquilina, &c, when they escaped if plunged in the

ground.

        1. On the Cagots. By D. Hack Tuke, M.D., F.P.O.P.

1. The Cagots are not the descendants of the Goths ; they are not a distinct

race, but a despised class among the people of the country in which they live.

2. They are not more subject to goitre or to cretinism than the inhabitants in

their vicinity                                                    in short, cagotism and cretinism are in no way allied.

3. The present representatives of the Cagots are now recognised by tradition,

and not by their features, and are not distinguished by any peculiar mental or

physical disorder, except when residing in an unhealthy locality.

4. Although nothing like leprosy or leucoderrna has for long affected the Cagots,

and no one on the spot regards them in this light, there is evidence to show that

they were originally either lepers labouring under a particular variety of leprosy, or

were affected  with                                               leucoderrna                                              the  form  of the  affection  accounting for their being

regarded as in some respects different from ordinary lepers, though shunned in the

same way.

5. Many were no doubt falsely suspected of leprosy in consequence of some

slight skin affection. Others again, in later centuries, were members of families

in whom the disease had died out.

2. Evidence of the Existence of Palceolithic Man during the Glacial Period
    in EastAnglia. By Sydney B. J. Skertchly, F.G.S., E.M. Geological

      Survey.

     The object of this paper is chiefly to record the sections in which the author
has discovered palasolithic implements beneath the chalky boulder clay in East

Anglia.

     The beds which yield the implements are a series of loams, clays, and sands, to
which the author has given the name of Brandon Beds. They occur at the top of

the Middle Glacial Series of Messrs. S. V. Wood, jun., and F. W. Harmer, and

underlie the Chalky Boulder Clay or Upper Glacial of the above-named authors.
    They have yielded paleolithic implements in many places, but only those will

be described in which the Chalky Boulder Clay overlies the Brandon Beds at the

present time.

     Mildenhall--l$ea,r Mildenhall, on the River Lark, in Suffolk, two sections have
yielded implements. They are at Warren Hill and Mildenhall Brickyard.

     The section at Warren Hill is as follows :

                                                                                                                                                         It.

This spot has yielded great numbers of flakes and many implements. It was
originally described by Professor Prestwich, but the boulder clay has only recently

been exposed above the tool-bearing loams.

Brandon Beds at this place. Some well-worked implements have been obtained,
one of which was dug out by the author.

   --Brandon. Near Brandon the same beds are being dug beneath boulder clay,

and have yielded very good implements.
     The peculiarities of the implements are pointed out, and the mode of distin-

guishing them from specimens from the gravels is indicated.
     The author in this paper merely desires to emphasize the fact that from several

sections he has himself dug out palaeolithic implements from below tough, undis-

turbed chalky boulder clay.

             3. On a Neiu Estimate of the Date of the Neolithic Age.
        By Sydney B. J. Skertchly, F.G.S., H.M. Geological Survey.

     M. Morlot estimated from the rate at which the cone of Tiniere was forming,
that from 5,000 to 7,000 years ago Switzerland was in its Neolithic age and M.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

Gillierson ascribes a like date to that period from a calculation of the rate of silting
up of a portion of the Lake of Bienne.

     The author points out that a similar result is obtained from physical evidence

in the Fenland. This district occupies an area of 1,300 square miles around the
great bay of the Wash. The surface of the inland portions consists of peat, and
that of the seaward parts of marine silt. This silt is still in process of deposition,

and the land is consequently gaining upon the sea. From the time of the Roman

occupation, at least, banks have been successively erected to reclaim the newly
formed ground and as the dates of these banks are known, very accurate estimates

                                                                                   ;

can be formed of the rate at which the deposition is going on in different parts.

The maximum rate is 59 feet per annum ; and 4 miles of new land has been

formed since the oldest banks were erected. These banks are generally ascribed to

the Romans : but they are probably British. In this estimate they will be taken
as Roman, in order that the age may not be over-estimated, and the maximum rate
of deposition will also be used as giving the minimum of time.

     The geological evidence shows that as the silting went on, and the area became
converted into land, peat grew and gradually spread over the newly formed ground.
But in process of time the climate became unfitted for the growth of peat, which
gradually lost its vigour, and finally ceased to form. Hence a wide stretch of silt
land borders the Wash, upon the surface of which no peat has ever formed. The
peat died upon its eastward march ; the silt still travels on.

     The nearest approach of the peat to the banks along the line of most rapid accu-
mulation is 12 miles distant therefrom. The age of this, the newest peat in the

Fenland, can be thus determined. Between the ' Roman ' banks and the sea lie

four miles of silt, which has taken 1 ,700 years to accumulate. Between these
banks and the sea lie 12 miles of silt, which at the same rate of formation would

take 5,100 years to accumulate. Adding 5,100 to 1,700 years, we have 6,800
years as the least possible age of the newest peat. This peat has yielded many
Neolithic implements. Hence we may assume that 7,000 years will take us back
--

into the Neolithic age. The coincidence of this estimate with the two Swiss ones

above mentioned is remarkable.
     These results do not, however, give us the date of the introduction of the Neo-

liths into Europe, for neither in the Swiss nor English localities are we sure that
the Neolithic relics belong to the early part of the Neolithic age. The author,
indeed, has recently obtained evidence of Neolithic handiwork in Fenland peat of
far greater age than that described, the peat bed underlying silt more than 7,000
years old. He is inclined to think that the Neolithic Age in England began at

least 10,000 years ago, and perhaps 20,000 years ; but that it does not approach
the close of the Glacial epoch, seems to be shown by the fact that the older Fen-

land beds (themselves post-glacial) do not contain human relics.

           A4. Classification of the Physical Conditions of Life.

                                By C. Roberts, F.B.C.S.

     It is only by examining the physical condition of a large number of individuals
by anthropometry that the actual state of health of a nation can be determined. The
present paper indicates the direction in which investigation may be made by
classifying the conditions of life which modify the development of the human
body. The most important of the agencies are race, climate, nurture, occupation,

and disease. An elaborate table accompanied the paper.

5. On the Yarra and the Languages of Australia in connection ivith those of
    the Mozambique and Portuguese Africa. By Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.I.

     In this paper Mr. Clarke showed that the Yarra dialect of Melbourne, and many
others of North, East, South, and West Australia are to be identified with the
Mozambique languages on the east coast of Africa, the Muntu, Kirimau, Marawi,
&c, with those of the other Bantu or Kaffre languages of Portuguese South Africa.
This was accompanied by a large table of words. Further, he showed that those
Mozambique roots which are not represented in the Yarra, See., are represented in

the Echuca and other Australian languages, thus completing the chain of identity.

Mr. Clarke pointed out that Dr. Caldwell had recognised the grammatical resem-

blances between Australian and the Dravidian of India, and Dr. W. H. Bleek

between Australian and Bantu. They had not been able to follow up these resem-

blances or to account for them. He stated, in the facts in another paper, that these
languages belonged to a common group, but had undergone different processes of
development. He supported the view of Mr. Brough Smith that Australia had

been under the influence of a white race in ancient epochs. Apart from the evi-
dence of language, grammar, and mythology, he dwelt on the curious fact that the
names of the languages of Australia are negatives, one of these negatives, Kabi,

being common throughout the world. He also referred to the geographical doc-

trine of the Four Worlds, as taught in the School of Pergamus, in proof that Aus-
tralasia had in earlier epochs been known to the ancients.

     The Chairman delivered the following Address :

    In surveying modern scientific opinion, the student is often reminded of a doctrine
proclaimed in the ancient hymns of the Zend-Avesta, that of Zrvdna akarana, or
' endless time.' Our modern schemes of astronomy, geology, biology are all
382 bepoet--1879.

framed on the assumption of past time immense in length. In fact, one reason why

the latter sciences grew so slowly till almost our own day, was their being shackled

by the bonds of a short chronology, allowing no room for the long successive
periods through which it is now clear that the earth with its plants and animals

passed into their present state. Even the Science of Man, though concerned with

the later forms of being, belonging to times which geologists treat as almost

modern, has nevertheless to deal with periods of time extending far back beyond

the range of history and chronology.

Looking back 4,000 to 5,000 years, what is the appearance of mankind as dis-

closed to us by the Egyptian monuments and inscriptions ? Several of the best-

marked races of man were already in existence, including the brown Egyptian

himself, the dark-white Semitic man of Assyria or Palestine, the Central African

of two varieties, which travellers still find as distinct as ever, namely, the black or

Negro proper, and the copper-coloured negroid, like the Bongo or Nyam-nyam of

our own time. Indeed, the evidence accessible as to ancient races of man goes to

prove that the causes which brought about their differences in types of skull, hair,

skin, and constitution, did their chief work in times before history began. Since

then the races which had become adapted to their geographical regions may have,

on the whole, undergone little change while remaining there, but some alterations

are traced as due to migration into new climates. Even these are difficult to follow,

masked as they are by the more striking changes produced by intermarriage of

Nowraces.  the view that the races of man are to be accounted for as varied

descendants of one original stock is zoologically probable from the close resemblance

of all men in body and mind, and the freedom with which races intercross. If it

was so, then the fact of the different races already existing early in the historical

period compels the naturalist to look to a prse-historic period for their development

to have taken place in. And considering how strongly differenced are the Negro
and the Syrian, and how slowly such changes of complexion and feature take place

within historical experience, this prse-historic period was probably of vast length.

The evidence from the languages of the world points in the same direction. In

times of ancient history we already meet with families of languages, such as the

Aryan and the Semitic, and as later history goes on many other families of lan-

guage come into view, such as the Bantu or Kafir of Africa, the Dravidian of South

India, the Malayo-Polynesian, the Algonquiu of North America, and other families.

But what we do not find is the parent language of any of these families, the original

language which all the other members are dialects of, so that this parent tongue

should stand towards the rest in the relation which Latin holds to its descendants,

Italian and French. It is, however, possible to work back by the method of philo-

logical comparison, so as to sketch the outlines of that early Aryan tongue which

must have existed to produce Sanskrit and Persian, Greek and Latin, German,

Russian, and Welsh, or the outlines of that early Semitic tongue which must have

existed to produce Assyrian, Phoenician, Hebrew, and Arabic. Though such theo-

retical reconstructions of parent languages from their descendants may only show a

vague and shadowy likeness to the reality, they give some idea of it. And what

concerns us here is that theoretical early Aryan and Semitic, or other such recon-

structed languages, do not bring our minds appreciably nearer to really primitive

forms of speech. However far we get back, the signs of development from still

earlier stages are there. The roots have mostly settled into forms which no longer

show the reasons why they were originally chosen, while the inflexions only in part

preserve traces of their original senses, and the whole structure is such as only a long-

lost past can account for. To illustrate this important point, let us remember the

system of grammatical gender in Greek or German, how irrationally a classification

by sex is applied to sexless objects and thoughts, while even the use of a neuter

gender fails to set the confusion straight, and sometimes even twists it with a

new perversity of its own. Many a German and Frenchman wishes he could

follow the example of our English forefathers who, long ago, threw overboard

the whole worthless cargo of grammatical gender. But looking at gender in the

ancient grammars, it must be remembered that human custom is hardly ever

wilfully absurd, its unreasonableness usually arising from loss or confusion of old

sense. Thus it can hardly be doubted that the misused grammatical gender
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  383

in Hebrew or Greek is the remains of an older and reasonable phenomenon of
language ; but if so, this must have belonged to a period earlier than we can assign

to the theoretical parent language of either. Lastly, the development of civilisa-

tion requires a long period of pros-historic time. Experience and history show that
civilisation grew up gradually, while every age preserves recognisable traces of the

--ages which went before. The woodman's axe of to-day still retains much of the

form of its ancestor the stone celt in its wooden handle ; the mathematician's tables
keep up in their decimal notation a record of the early ages when man's ten fingers
first taught him to count ; the very letters with which I wrote these lines may be
followed back to the figures of birds and beasts and other objects drawn by the
ancient Egyptians, at first as mere picture writing to denote the things represented.
Yet, when we learn from the monuments what ancient Egyptian life was like

towards 5,000 years ago, it appears that civilisation had already come on so far
that there was an elaborate system of government, an educated literary priesthood,

a nation skilled in agriculture, architecture, and metal work. These ancient Egyp-
tians, far from being near the beginning of civilisation, had, as the late Baron Bunsen
held, already reached its halfway house. This eminent Egyptologist's moderate
estimate of man's age on the earth at about 20,000 years has the merit of having
been made on historical grounds alone, independently of geological evidence, for the

proofs of the existence of man in the quaternary or mammoth period had not yet

gained acceptance.

    My purpose in briefly stating here the evidence of man's antiquity derived from

race, language, and culture is to insist that these arguments stand on their own

ground. It is true that the geological argument from the implements in the drift-

gravels and bone-caves, by leading to a general belief that man is extremely ancient
on the earth, has now made it easier to anthropologists to maintain a rationally
satisfactory theory of the race-types and mental development of mankind. But we
should by no means give up this vantage ground, though the ladder we climbed
by should break down. Even if it could be proved that the flint implements of

Abbeville or Torquay were really not so ancient as the pyramids of Egypt, this
would not prevent us from still assuming, for other and sufficient reasons, a period

of human life on earth extending many thousand years farther back.

     It is an advantage of this state of the evidence that it to some extent gets rid
of the ' sensational ' element in the problem of fossil man, which it leaves as
merely an interesting inquiry into the earliest known relics of savage tribes.

Geological criticism has not yet absolutely settled either way the claims of the
Abbe" Bourgeois' flints from Thenay to be of Miocene date, or of Mr. Skertchly's
from Brandon to be Glacial. The accepted point is that the men who made the

ordinary flint implements of the drift lived in the quaternary period characterised

by the presence of the mammoth in our part of Europe. More than one geologist,

however, has lately maintained that this quaternary period was not of extreme
antiquity. The problem is at what distance from the present time the drift-gravels

on the valley slopes can have been deposited by water action up to one hundred feet
or so above the present flood-levels. It does not seem the prevailing view among
geologists that rivers on the same small scale as those at present occupying mere
ditches in the wide valley-floors could have left these deposits on the hill" sides at a
time when they had not yet scooped out the valleys to within fifty or a hundred
feet of their present depth. Indeed, such means are insufficient out of all propor-

tion to the results, as a mere look down from the hill-tops into such valleys is

enough to show. Geologists connect the deposit of the high drift-gravels with the
subsidence and elevation of the land, and the powerful action of ice and water at
the close of the Glacial age ; and the term ' Pluvial period ' is often used to charac-
terise this time of heavy rainfall and huge rivers. It was then that the rude stone

implements of palaeolithic man were imbedded in the drift-gravels with the
remains of the mammoth and fossil rhinoceros, and we have to ask what events

have taken place in these regions since P The earth's surface has been altered to
bring the land and water to their present levels, the huge animals became extinct,
the country was inhabited by the tribes whose relics belong to the neolithic or
polished-stone age, and afterwards the metal-using Keltic nations possessed the
land, their arrival being fixed as previous to 400 B.C., the king of the Gauls then

--being called by the Romans by the name Brennus, which is simply the Keltic

word for ' kin 0, ' in modern Welsh brenin. To take in this succession of events
geologists and archaeologists generally hold that a long period is required. Yet
there are some few who find room for them all in a comparatively short period.
I will mention Principal Dawson, of Montreal, well known as a geologist in this

Association, and who has shown his conviction of the soundness of his views by

adressing them to the general public in a little volume entitled ' The Story of the
Earth and Man.' Having examined the gravels of St.-Acheul, on the Somme,

where M. Boucher de Perthes found his celebrated drift implements, it appeared

to Dr. Dawson that, taking into account the probabilities of a different level of
the land, a wooded condition of the country and greater rainfall, and a glacial

filling up of the Somme valley with clay and stones subsequently cut out by

running water, the gravels could scarcely be older than the Abbeville peat, and
the age of this peat he estimates as perhaps less than four thousand years. Within

this period Dr. Dawson includes a comparatively rapid subsidence of the land,

with a partial re-elevation, which left large areas of the lower grounds beneath
the sea. This he describes as the geological deluge which separates the post-glacial

period from the modern, and the earlier from the later prehistoric period of the

archaeologists.

    My reason for going here into these computations of Dr. Dawson's is that the

date about 2200 B.C., to which he thus assigns these great geological convulsions,
is actually within historic times. In Egypt successive dynasties had been reigning

for ages, and the pyramids had long been built ; while in Babylonia the old
Chaldrean kings had been raising the temples whose ruins still remain. That is to

say, we are asked to receive, as matter of geology, that stupendous geological

changes were going on not far from the Mediterranean, including a final plunge of

I know not how much of the earth's surface beneath the waters, and yet national

life on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates went on unbroken and apparently

undisturbed through it all. To us in this Section it is instructive to see how the
free use of paroxysms and cataclysms makes it possible to shorten up geological
time. Accustomed as we are to geology demanding periods of time which often
seem to history exorbitant, the tables are now turned, and we are presented with

the unusual spectacle of chronology protesting against geology for encroaching on

the historical period.

     In connection with the question of quaternary man, it is worth while to notice
that the use of the terms ' primaeval ' or ' primitive ' man, with reference to the

savages of the mammoth period, seems sometimes to lead to unsound inferences.

There appears no particular reason to think that the relics from the drift-beds or

hone-caves represent man as he first appeared on the earth. The contents of the

caves especially bear witness to a state of savage art, in some respects fairly high,

and which may possibly have somewhat fallen off from an ancestral state in a more

favourable climate. Indeed, the savage condition generally, though rudeand more

or less representing early stages of culture, never looks absolutely primitive, just
as no savage language ever has the appearance of being a primitive language.

What the appearance and state of our really primaeval ancestors may have been

seems too speculative a question, until there shall be more signs of agreement

between the anthropologists, who work back by comparison of actual races of man
toward a hypothetical common stock, and the zoologists, who approach the problem

through the species adjoining the human. There is, however, a point relating to
the problem to which attention is due. Naturalists not unreasonably claim to find

the geographical centre of man in the tropical regions of the old world inhabited

by his nearest zoological allies, the anthropomorphous apes, and there is at any
rate force enough in such a view to make careful quest of human remains worth
while in those districts, from Africa across to the Eastern Archipelago. Under the
care of Mr. John Evans a fund has been raised for excavations in the caves of
Borneo by Mr. Everett, and though the search has as yet had no striking result,
money is well spent in carrying on such investigations in likely equatorial forest
regions. It would be a pity that for want of enterprise a chance, however slight,

should be missed of settling a question so vital to anthropology.

    While the problem of primitive man thus remains obscure, a somewhat more
       TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.                   385

distinct opinion may be formed on the problem of primitive civilised man. When
it is asked what races of mankind first attained to civilisation, it may be answered

that the earliest nations known to have had the art of writing, the great mark of

civilisation as distinguished from barbarism, were the Egyptians and Babylonians,

who in the remotest ages of history appear as nations advanced to the civilised'

stage in arts and social organisation. The question is, Under what races to class

them ? What the ancient Egyptians were like is well lenown from the monuments,
which show how closely much of the present fellah population, as little changed in

features as in climate and life, represent their ancestors of the times of the

Pharaohs. Their reddish-brown skin, and features tending toward the negroid, have

led Hartmann, the latest anthropologist who has carefully studied them, to adopt

the classification of them as belonging to the African rather than the Asiatic

peoples, and specially to insist on their connection with the Berber type, a view

which_ seems to have been held by Blumenbach. The contrast of the brown

Egyptians with the dark-white Syro-Arabians on their frontiers is strongly

marked, and the portraits on the monuments show how distinctly the Egyptian
knew himself to be of different race from the Semite. Yet there was mixture

between the two races, and what is most remarkable, there is a deep-seated

Semitic element in the Egyptian language, only to be accounted for by some

extremely ancient and intimate connection. On the whole, the Egyptians may

be a mixed race, mainly of African origin, perhaps from the southern Somali-land,

whence the Egyptian tradition was that the gods came, while their African type
may have since been modified by Asiatic admixture. Next, as to the early rela-

tions of Babylonia and Media, a different problem presents itself. The languages

of these nations, the so-called Akkadian and the early Medic, were certainly not

of the same family with either the Assyrian or the Persian which afterwards

prevailed in their districts. Their connection with the Tatar or Turanian family

of languages, asserted twenty years ago by Oppert, has since been further main-

tained by Lenormant and Sayce, and seems, if not conclusively settled, at any rate
to have much evidence for it, not depending merely on similarity of words, such

as the term for ' god,' Akkadian dingira, being like the Tatar tengri, but also on

similarity of pronouns and grammatical structure by post-positions. Now language,

though not a conclusive argument as to race, always proves more or less as to con-

nection. The comparison of the Akkadian language to that of the Tatar family is

at any rate prima facie evidence that the nations who founded the ancient civilisa-
tion of Babylonia, who invented the cuneiform writing, and who carried on the

astronomical observations which made the name of Chaldean famous for all time,
may have been not dark-white peoples like the Assyrians who came after them, but

perhaps belonged to the yellow race of Central Asia, of whom the Chinese are the
branch now most distinguished in civilisation. M. Lenormant has tried to identify

among the Assyrian bas-reliefs certain figures of men whose round skulls, high

cheek-bones, and low-bridged noses present a Mongoloid type contrasting with that
Weof the Assyrians.
                     cannot, I think, take this as proved, but at any rate in

these figures the features are not those of the aquiline Semitic type. The bronze

statuette of the Ckaldasan king called Gudea, which I have examined with Mr.

Pinches at the British Museum, is also, with its straight nose and long thin beard,

as un-Assyrian as may be. The anthropological point towards which all this
Wetends is one of great interest.
                                   of the white race are so used to the position

of leaders in civilisation, that it does not come easy to us to think we may not

have been its original founders. Yet the white race, whether the dark-whites, such

as Phoenicians or Hebrews, Greeks or Romans, or the fair-whites, such as Scandi-

navians and Teutons, appear in history as followers and disciples of the Egyptians

and Babylonians who taught the world writing, mathematics, philosophy. These

Egyptians and Babylonians, so far as present evidence reaches, seem rather to have

belonged to the races of brown and yellow skin than to the white race.

It may be objected that this reasoning is in several places imperfect, but it is

the use of a departmental address not only to lay down proved doctrines, but to

state problems tentatively as they lie open to further inquiry. This will justify

my calling attention to a line of argument which, imcertain as it at present is, mav

perhaps lead to an interesting result. So ancient was civilisation among both

Egyptians and Chaldseans, that the contest as to their priority in such matters as

magical science was going on hotly in the classic ages of Greece and Rome. Looking

at the literature and science, the arts and politics, of Memphis and of Ur of the

Chaldees, both raised to such height of culture near 5,000 years ago, we ask, were

these civilisations not connected, did not one borrow from the other ? There is

at present a clue which, though it may lead to nothing, is still worth trial. The

hint of it lies in a remark by Dr. Birch as to one of the earliest of Egyptian monu-

ments, the pyramid of Kochome, near Sakkara, actually dating from the first dynasty,

no doubt beyond 3000 B.C., and which is built in steps like the seven-storied Baby-

onian temples. Two other Egyptian pyramids, those of Abu-sir, are also built in
steps. Now whether there is any connection between the building of these pyra-

mids and the Babylonian towers, does not depend on their being built in stages, but

in the number of these stages being seven. As to the Babylonian towers, there is

no doubt, for though Birs-Nimrud is now a ruinous heap, the classical descriptions

of such temples, and the cuneiform inscriptions, put it beyond question that they

had seven stages, dedicated to the seven planets. As to the Egyptian pyramids,

the archaeologists Segato and Masi positively state of one step-pyramid of Abu-sir,

that it had seven decreasing stages, while, on the other hand, Vyse's reconstruction

of the step-pyramid of Sakkara shows there only six. Considering the ruinous

state of all three step-pyramids, it will require careful measurement to settle whether

they originally had seven stages or not. If they had, the correspondence cannot be

set down to accident, but must be taken to prove a connection between Ckaldsea

and Egypt as to the worship of the seven planets, which will be among the most

ancient links connecting the civilisations of the world. I hope by thus calling

attention to the question, to induce some competent architect visiting Egypt to

place the matter beyond doubt, one way or the other.

While speaking of the high antiquity of civilisation in Egypt, the fact calls for

remark, that the use of iron as well as bronze in that country seems to go back

as far as historical record reaches. Brugsch writes in his 'Egypt under the

Pharaohs,' that Egypt throws scorn on the archaeologists' assumed successive

periods of stone, bronze, and iron. The eminent historian neglects, however, to

mention facts which give a different complexion to the early Egyptian use of

metals, namely, that chipped flints, apparently belonging to a prehistoric Stone

Age, are picked up plentifully in Egypt, while the sharp stones or stone knives

used by the embalmers seem also to indicate an earlier time when these were the

cutting instruments in ordinary use. Thus there are signs that the Metal Age in

Egypt, as elsewhere in the world, was preceded by a Stone Age, and if so, the high

antiquity of the use of metal only throws back to a still higher antiquity the use of

stone. The ancient iron-working in Egypt is, however, the chief of a group of facts
which are now affecting the opinions of anthropologists on the question whether

the Bronze Age everywhere preceded the Iron Age. In regions where, as in Africa,

iron ore occurs in such a state that it can after mere heating in the fire be forged

into implements, the invention of iron-working would be more readily made than

that of the composite metal bronze, which perhaps indicates a previous use of copper,

afterwards improved on by an alloy of tin. Professor Rolleston,in a recent address

on the Iron, Bronze, and Stone Ages, insists with reason that soft iron may have

been first in the hands of many tribes, and may have been superseded by bronze as

Wea preferable material for tools and weapons.  moderns, used to fine and cheap

steel, hardly do justice to the excellence of bronze, or gun-metal as we should now
call it, in comparison with any material but steel. I well remember my own surprise
at seeing in the Naples Museum that the surgeons of Herculaneuni and Pompeii used

instruments of bronze. It is when hard steel comes in, that weapons both of bronze

and wrought iron have to yield, as when the long soft iron broad-swords of the
Gauls bent at the first blow against the pikes of Flaminius' soldiers. On the whole,

Professor Virchow's remarks in the Transactions of the Berlin Anthropological

Society for 1876, on the question whether it may be desirable to recognise instead

of three only two ages, a Stone Age and a Metal Age, seem to put the matter on
a fair footing. Iron may have been known as early as bronze or even earlier, but

nevertheless there have been periods in the life of nations when bronze, not iron,
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.           387

has been the metal in use. Thus there is nothing to interfere with the facts rest-

ing on archaeological evidence, that in such districts as Scandinavia or Switzerland

Wea Stone Age was at some ancient time followed by a Bronze Age, and this again
by an Iron Age.  may notice that the latter change is what has happened in

America within a few centuries, where the Mexicans and Peruvians, found by the

Spaniards living in the Bronze Age, were moved on into the Iron Age. But the

question is whether we are to accept as a general principle in history the doctrine

expounded in the poem of Lucretius, that men first used boughs and stones, that

then the use of bronze became known, and lastly iron was discovered. As the

evidence stands now, the priority of the Stone Age to the Metal Age is more

firmly established than ever, but the origin of both bronze and iron is lost in
antiquity, and we have no certain proof which came first.

     Passing to another topic of our science, it is satisfactory to see with what

activity the comparative study of laws and customs, to which Sir Henry Maine
gave a new starting-point in England, is now pursued. The remarkable inquiry

minto the very foundations of society in the structure of the family, set afoot by

Bachofen his ' Miitterrecht,' and M'Lennan in his ' Primitive Marriage,' is now
bringing in every year new material. Mr. L. H. Morgan, who, as an adopted

Iroquois, became long ago familiar with the marriage-laws and ideas of kinship of
uncultured races, so unlike those of the civilised world, has lately made, in his
* Ancient Society,' a bold attempt to solve the whole difficult problem of the develop-
ment of social life. I will not attempt here any criticism of the views of these and

Myother writers on a problem where the last word has certainly not been said.

object in touching the subject is to mention the curious evidence that can still be
given by rude races as to their former social ties, in traditions which will be forgotten

in another generation of civilised life, but may still be traced by missionaries and
others who know what to seek for. Thus, such inquiry in Polynesia discloses

remarkable traces of a prevalent marriage-tie which was at once polygamous and
polyandrous, as where a family of brothers were married jointly to a family of
sisters; and I have just noticed in a recent volume on 'Native Tribes of South

Australia,' a mention of a similar state of things occurring there. As to the
general study of customs, the work done for years past by such anthropologists as

Professor Bastian, of Berlin, is producing substantial progress. Among recent

works I will mention Dr. Karl Andree's ' Ethnologische Paralleled and Mr. J. A.

Farrer's ' Primitive Manners.' In the comparison of customs and inventions,

however, the main difficulty still remains to be overcome, how to decide certainly

whether they have sprung up independently alike in different lands through like-

ness in the human mind, or whether they have travelled from a common source. To
show how difficult this often is, I may mention the latest case I have happened to meet
with. The Orang Dongo, a mountain people in the Malay region, have a custom of
inheritance that when a man dies the relatives each take a share of the property,

and the deceased inherits one share for himself, which is burnt or buried for his

ghost's use, or eaten at the funeral feast. This may strike many of my hearers as

quaint enough and unlikely to recur elsewhere ; but Mr. Charles Elton, who has
special knowledge of our ancient legal customs, has pointed out to me that it was
actually old Kentish law, thus laid down in Law-French:-- 'Ensement seient les

chateus de gauylekendeys parties en treis apres le exequies e les dettes rendues si il

y est issue mulier en vye, issi que la mort eyt la une partie, e les fitz e les filles

muliers lautre partie e la femme la tierce partie.'--' In like sort let the chattels of

gavelkind persons be divided into three after the funeral and payment of debts if
there be lawful issue living, so that the deceased have one part, and the lawful sons
and daughters the other part, and the wife the third part.' The Church had indeed

taken possession, for pious uses, of the dead man's share of his own property ; but

there is good Scandinavian evidence that the original custom before Christian
times was for it to be put in his burial-mound. Thus the rite of the rude Malay
tribe corresponds with that of ancient Europe, and the question which the evidence
does not yet enable us to answer, is whether the custom was twice invented, or

whether it spread east and west from a common source, perhaps in the Aryan

district of Asia.

It remains for me to notice the present state of Comparative Mythology, a most
                                                 cc 2
--388 eepoet 1879.

interesting, but also most provoking part of Anthropology. More than twenty years

ago a famous essay, by Professor Max Miiller, made widely known in England bow
far the myths in the classical dictionary and the story-books of our own lands

might find their explanation in poetic nature-metaphors of sun and sky, cloud and

storm, such as are preserved in the ancient Aryan hymns of the Veda. Of

--course it had been always known that the old gods and heroes were in some part

personifications of nature that Helios and Okeanos, though they walked and

talked and begat sons and daughters, were only the Sun and Sea in poetic guise.

But the identifications of the new school went farther. The myth of Endymion
became the simple nature-story of the setting Sun meeting Selene the Moon ; and

I well remember how, at the Eoyal Institution, the aged scholar, Bishop Thirlwall,
grasped the stick he leant on, as if to make sure of the ground under his feet, when

he heard it propounded that Erinys, the dread avenger of murder, was a personifica-

tion of the Dawn discovering the deeds of darkness. Though the study of mythology

has grown apace in these later years, and many of its explanations will stand the

test of future criticism, I am bound to say that mythologists, always an erratic

race, have of late been making wilder work than ever with both myth and real

history, finding mythic suns and skies in the kings and heroes of old tradition, with

dawns for love-tales, storms for wars, and sunsets for deaths, often with as much

real cogency as if some rnythologist a thousand years hence should explain the

tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots as a nature-myth of a beauteous Dawn rising

in splendour, prisoned in a dark cloud-island, and done to death in blood-red sunset.

Learned treatises have of late, by such rash guessings, shaken public confidence in

the more sober reasonings on which comparative mythology is foimded, so that it is

well to insist that there are cases where the derivation of myths from poetic

metaphors is really proved beyond doubt. Such an instance is the Hindu legend

of King Bali, whose austerities have alarmed the gods themselves, when Vamana,

a Brahmanic Tom Thumb, begs of him as much land as he can measure in three

steps ; but when the boon is granted, the tiny dwarf expands gigantic into Vishnu

himself, and striding with one step across the earth, with another across the air,

and a third across the sky, drives the king down into the infernal regions, where he

still reigns. There are various versions of the story, of which one may be read in
Southey ; but in the ancient Vedic hymns its origin may be found when it was

not as yet a story at all, only a poetic metaphor of Vishnu, the Sun, whose often-

mentioned act is his crossing the airy regions in his three strides. ' Vishnu tra-

versed (the earth), thrice he put down his foot ; it was crushed under his dusty step.

Three steps hence made Vishnu, unharmed preserver, upholding sacred things.'
    Both in the savage and civilised world there are many myths which may be

plainly traced to such poetic fancies before they have yet stiffened into circumstan-

tial tales ; and it is in following out these, rather than in recklessly guessing myth-

origins for every tradition, that the sound work of the rnythologist lies. The scholar

must not treat such nature-poetry like prose, spoiling its light texture with too heavy

a grasp. In the volume published by our new Folk-Lore Society, which has begun

its work so well, Mr. Lang gi res an instance of the sportive nature-metaphor which

still lingers among popular story-tellers. It is Breton, and belongs to that wide-

spread tale of which one version is naturalised iu England as ' Dick "Whittington

--and his Oat.' The story runs thus : The elder brother has the cat, while the next

brother, who has a cock left him, fortunately finds his way to a land where (there

being no cocks) the king has every night to send chariots and horses to bring the

dawn                           so that here the  fortunate  owner of  Chanticleer has brought him to a good
                            ;

market. Thus we see that the Breton peasant of our day has not even yet lost

the mythic sense with which his remote Aryan ancestors could behold the chariots

and horses of the dawn. But myth, though largely based on such half-playful

metaphor, runs through all the intermediate stages which separate poetic fancy

from crude philosophy embodied in stories seriously devised as explanations of real

facts. No doubt many legends of the ancient world, though not really history, are

myths which have arisen by reasoning on actual events, as definite as that which,

some four years ago, was terrifying the peasant mind in North Germany, and

especially in Posen. The report had spread far and wide that all Catholic children

with black hair and blue eyes were to be sent out of the country, some said to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHKOPOLOGY.  389

Russia, while others declared that it was the King of Prussia who had heen playing

cards with the Sidtau of Turkey, and had staked and lost 40,000 fair-haired, blue-

eyed children ; and there were Moors travelling about in covered carts to collect
them · and the schoolmasters were helping, for they were to have five dollars for
every child they handed over. For a time the popular excitement was quite serious :
the parents kept the children away from school and hid them, and when they
appeared in the streets of the markei>town the little ones clung to them vi ith

terrified looks. Dr. Schwartz, the well-known mythologist, took the pains to traee

the rumour to its sources. One thing was quite plain, that its prime cause was
that grave and learned body, the Anthropological Society of Berlin, who, without a

thought of the commotion they were stirring up, had, in order to class the popula-
tion as to race, induced the authorities to have a census made throughout the local

schools to ascertain the colour of the children's skin, hair, and eyes. Had it been
only the boys, to the Government inspection of whom for military conscription the
German peasants are only too well accustomed, nothing would have been thought of
it ; but why shoidd the officials want to know about the little girls' hair and eyes ?

The whole group of stories which suddenly sprang up were myths created to
answer this question ; and even the details which became embodied with them
could all be traced to their sources, such as the memories of German princes selling

regiments of their people to pay their debts, the late political negotiations between
Germany and Russia, &c. The fact that a caravan of Moors had been travelling
about as a show accounted for the covered carts with which they were to fetch the
children ; while the schoolmasters were naturally implicated, as having drawn up

the census. One schoolmaster, who evidently knew his people, assured the terrified
parents that it was only the children with blue hair and green eyes that were
-wanted--an explanation which sent them home quite comforted. After all, there
is no reason why we shoidd not come in time to a thorough understanding of
mytholoo-y. The human mind is much what it used to be, and the principles of

myth-making may still be learnt from the peasants of Europe.
     AVhen within the memory of some here present, the Science of Man was just

coming into notice, it seemed as though the study of races, customs, traditions,
were a limited though interesting task, which might after a few years come so near

the end of its materials as no longer to have much new to offer. Its real course
has been far otherwise. Twenty years ago it was no difficult task to follow it step
by step · but now even the yearly list of new anthropological literature is enough

to form a pamphlet, and each capital of Europe has its Anthropological Society in

Ml work. So far from any look of finality in anthropological investigations, each

new line of argument but "opens the way to others behind, while these lines tend

 as plainly as in the sciences of stricter weight and measure, toward the meeting

ground of all sciences in the unity of nature.

2. On Flint Implements from the Valley of the Bann. By W. J. Knowles.

     The author has obtained within the last three or four years, from the banks of
the river Bann, a series of flint weapons or tools which differ considerably in type
from the ordinary flint implements of the North of Ireland. They have been
 obtained from a deposit of diatomaceous earth used for brickmaking near the town
 of Portglenone, and are of two types. That which is most numerous appears to
 have been made by splitting nodules into halves or quarters and then forming these
 into rude pointed implements by a process of coarse chipping. This kind numbers
 upwards of 50, and they all agree in having a cutting point, and thick base for

holding in the hand. They are, as a rule, long, narrow, and of a cylindrical form,
rather than broad and flat, but some of the latter kind occur. Some of the largest
are 7 or 8 inches long, and from 2 to 3 inches broad at the base, and there is one
very fine implement of the flat land, resembling the triangular Palaeolithic imple-
ments, which is 6 inches long, nearly 4 inches broad at the base and 1£ inch,
thick. Dr. Evans, in ' Stone Implements and Ornaments of Great Britain,' mentions
that he has found implements of Palaeolithic form on the shores of Lough Neagh,
near Toome. The author has also found similar implements at that place ; but as
Tooine is only a little farther up the Bann, and the diatoniaceous earth is found
there, he believes they have been obtained from that deposit by denudation.

    The second set of objects may be described as large triangular flakes with a
central rib down the back and having the base wrought into a tang. In the

Catalogue of the Royal Irish Academy, this form of implement is represented in
Fig. 3, the tang being looked on as the first step in the process of development into
arrow and spear heads ; but the author is of opinion that instead of showing a step
towards greater perfection these were perfect implements of their kind, and also
manufactured specially for use about rivers.

    There is no means of determining the age of these objects, except some sort of es-
timate is formed from the fact of their being found in a deposit underlying the peat.
If they are of Neolithic age, they are very interesting from being confined chiefly to
a river valley and not being obtained where other Neolithic implements are found
in abundance. This fact would, according to the author, suggest a reason for the
large triangular flints of Palaeolithic age being chiefly confined to the old river
gravels, while the implements of the same age from the caves are so different. The
implements of the pointed kind in all cases might not be for general use, but chiefly

for the river valleys. They may probably have formed weapons for attacking the
larger animals when they came down to drink, but the theory that they were used
for breaking holes in ice is also a very likely one. The author believes that the
tanged flakes were used mounted, probably for spearing fish, as suggested by Dr..
Evans in ' Archaeologia,' vol. xli. p. 401.

3. Notes on the Polynesian Race. By C. Staniland Wake.

The object of the paper was to show that the statements of recent writers that

the Polynesian Islanders are a scantily bearded race, and that they are not acquainted,

with the bow and arrow, are erroneous. The evidence of travellers was cited'

showing that the beard is fully developed with the natives of Penrhyn Island, the

Gambier Islands, the Hervey Islands, the Society Islands, Savage Island, New

Zealand, the Marquesas Islands, and the Sandwich Islands. It was shown also

that the natives of some of the Ellice group of islands, which were populated

from Samoa, wear the beard, and that the Tongans who visit Fiji cultivate consider-

able beards, in imitation of the Fijians, from which we may infer that the beardless

character of the Samoans, who appear to be the parent stock of the Eastern Pacific

islanders, is not owing to a natural defect.

    As to the bow and arrow, it was shown that this weapon was formerly used

by the Society Islanders, the Sandwich Islanders, and the Friendly Islanders, and

that it was not unknown to the natives of Savage Island, the Ellice Islands, the

Hervey Islands, and New Zealand. Its inefficiency as a weapon of war had, how-

ever, led to its abandonment, except in certain sports which were restricted to the

chiefs. That it had not been derived by the Polynesians from the Papuans is

proved by the word for ' bow,' paiutJi, being the same in the Polynesian and

Malayan languages, but different in that of Fiji.

    As the bow was not known to the New Caledonians and Tasmanians, probably

the Papuans were not  acquainted with it at the  date of  their  earliest  migrations
                                                                                                                        ;

and as the Polynesians used it only in their sports, it must have lost its warlike

character before they left their early home in the Indian Archipelago.

In conclusion, the paper proposed the use of the term Kanaka as a name for

the Polynesian race, instead of Mahori, a name recently introduced by Mr. Ranken

justifying the proposal by reference to the meaning and derivation of the term

kanaka or tangata, which denotes ' man ' and ' mankind ' in all the Polynesian
dialects, and by the fact, that the Pacific Islanders are already known in the East

as Kanaks.

    4. On the Relations of the Indo-Chinese and Inter-Oceanic Races and
                        Languages. By A. H. Keane, M.A.I.

      Recent ethnological research in Further India and Malaysia could not fail to

affect the views hitherto entertained on the affinities of the peoples occupying this
area. The discovery of a non-Mongolian fair type in Lido-China, connected in

physique with the Western Asiatic type conventionally known as ' Caucasian,' and
speaking polysyllabic untoned languages, introduces a distinctly new factor into

the problem. An attempt is here made to show that this factor offers the true

solution of the intricate questions connected with the mutual relations of all the
Indo-Chinese and Inter-Oceanic peoples. The conclusions I have arrived at are

briefly these :

    I. Two ethnical types, the fair and the yellow, have occupied Indo-China from

the remotest times. The yellow, or Mongoloid, is represented by the Burmese,
Khassias, Shans, Siamese, Laos, Annamese, mostly semi-civilised and settled, and
all exclusively speaking monosyllabic toned languages. The fair, or Caucasian,

varying from white to different shades of brown, is represented by the semi-civilised

and settled Cambojans or Khmers, Khmer-doms or ' Primitive Khniers,' Chams and
Kuys, and by the unsettled hill-tribes collectively known as Mois, Khas, Penongs,
or Lolos, all speaking closely related polysyllabic untoned languages. The his-
torical continuity of the fair type is shown by reference to the bas-reliefs of Ongkor-

Vaht.
     II. Malaysia and Western Polynesia were originally occupied by two dark

--autochthonous types, for the present to be held as distinct the Papuans mainly

in the East, the Negritos mainly in the West. The Negritos are still represented

--by disjecta membra Aetas in the Philippines, Samangs in Malacca, ' Mincopies ' in

the Andaman Islands, Kalangs in Java, Karons in New Guinea, possibly by others

in Borneo and Formosa. But elsewhere they have everywhere been rather sup-

planted than absorbed by the intruding fair and yellow races from Indo-China.

--The Papuans are still represented by compact masses Nufors, Arfaks, Kiotapus,

Koiaris, Waigiu, Aru, &c, in and about New Guinea; elsewhere they have rather

been fused with than supplanted by the fair and yellow races, the fusion resulting

in the so-called ' Alfuros ' of Oeram, Timor, Jilolo, Mysol, and other islands west of

New Guinea, and in the Melanesians of the Admiralty, New Hebrides, Solomon,
Fiji, Loyalty, New Caledonia, and other islands east of New Guinea.

    HI. Western Malaysia is now almost exclusively occupied by the fair and

yellow stocks from Indo-China, everywhere intermingled in diverse proportions, but

the fair, as the earliest arrivals, everywhere forming the substratum. Where the

yellow prevails, the outcome are the typical Malays of Malacca, Java, parts of .

Sumatra, Bali, Lombok, Coasts of Borneo, &c. Where the fair prevails, the out-

--come are the so-called ' Indonesians,' or ' Pre-Malays ' Battaks, Passumahs,

Atyehs, Lampungs of Sumatra, Dyaks and Kayans of Borneo, the natives of
Celebes, Nias, Pom, &c. Thus the Malay is not an organic, but essentially a
mixed type, oscillating between the fair and yellow, and at the extremes impercep-

tibly merging in both.
     IV. But though the Malay is ethnically a mixed type, its speech is unmixed in

structure, and fundamentally related to the Cambojan and other languages spoken
by the fair races of Further India. This relationship is established on a sound
philological basis, and the morphology of all these tongues is shown to be iden-
tical. The Indo-Pacific (so-called ' Malayo-Polynesian ') linguistic family is thus
extended so as to embrace the polysyllabic untoned languages of Indo-China, as
the source whence all the Oceanic branches derive. The total absence of the
monosyllabic toned languages of the yellow races from the Oceanic area is accounted
for, this remarkable fact affording the key to the order in which the prehistoric
migrations took place from the mainland to the Archipelago.
                                       --

392 repoet-- 1879.

     V. The large brown race in almost exclusive possession of Eastern Polynesia
(Samoans, Tahitians, Maoris, Hawaiians, Tonga and Marquesas islanders), is
affiliated, not to the typical Malays, but to that element in Malaysia which diverges
most from the Mongoloid and approaches nearest to the Caucasian type. The
migration of the fair race from the Archipelago eastwards is shown to have taken
place at an extremely remote epoch, before or simultaneously with the arrival of
the yellow races from Further India, consequently before the evolution of the Malay
type proper. Hence there are no true Malayan ethnical elements and no Mongol
blood in Eastern Polynesia. The direct connection of the Eastern Polynesians
with the Indonesians of Malaysia is further confirmed on linguistic, physical, and

ethical grounds.
     Conclusion. Excluding the dark races there are in the Indo-Chinese and Inter-

--Oceanic area two fundamentally distinct racial types only the yellow or Mongo-

lian, and the fair or Caucasian ; and corresponding to them two fundamentally

--distinct forms of speech only the Monosyllabic spoken vario tono, and the Poly-

syllabic spoken recto tono. All the rest is the outcome of incessant secular inter-
minglings.

        5. On a Classification of Languages on the Basis of Ethnology.
                                  By Dr. Gustav Oppert.

     All languages display either a concrete or an abstract tendency, and it is on this
distinction that the author's classification is primarily based. Both the concrete
and the abstract divisions are subdivided, each into two classes. The divisions of
the concrete class are termed heterologous and homologous; while those of the abstract
class are called digeneous and trigeneous. Further subdivisions are suggested. The
author's views are developed in a work on Comparative Philology, recently published
in Madras.

The following Papers and Pieport were read :

1. On the Manners and Customs of the People of Urua. Central Africa.
                         By Commander Cameron, B.N.

The author remarked that the king of this people, Cassango, claimed divine

honours                                   that it was  supposed by the  people                                         that  on  the  death of one  king  his
                                       ;

spirit entered the body of                             his successor                                                   and that on the death of the monarch his
                                                                                                                    ;

wives, with the exception of one, who remained to be the pythoness of his suc-

cessor, were buried alive with him, with savage rites. The course of a river is

diverted to furnish a ready grave. Here the terrible sacrifice is made, and then

the waters, sent back into their original course, flow over the dreadful tomb. It

seems that the religion of these people centres round an idol which is said to be

located in an immense jungle. Such is the reverence, or rather awe, in which the

people hold this god that they fear to pronounce its name. None but the king may

sacrifice to it, excepting the sovereign's sister, who is given to the idol as a wife.

Priests, of course, guard the grove of this oracle ; and smaller oracles, of which the

people do not stand in so much awe, are consulted on matters of every day life.

The ventriloquial powers of the wizards who carry those idols are exercised "when
Athe answers are given.
                                                       clearly defined caste prevails amongst the people. One
chief may not sit down in the presence of another of superior grade. Each class

Awears a distinctive apron. Mutilation is common as a punishment.                                                                                   story was

told of one wife of the king offering to undergo the penalty of having her ears cut

off if she might have a slave. The king took her at her word. The mutilation
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  393

was done without giving much apparent pain or vexation to the lady. The flow of

blood is staunched" by an application of boiling porridge. Their notions of pro-

priety are peculiar, and will not allow them to cook at another person's fire, or
to drink while another is looking on. Tattooing is an elaborate work of art in this
curious country ; and one of the punishments a husband may inflict on an insubor-

dinate wife is to cut, say out of her arm, a portion of the pattern tattooed there.

The lady is then obliged to stay at home. Attention was called to the skill of
this rude people in communicating long messages to distant places by the beat of

the drum. They employ, in fact, a kind of telegraphic system.
     In Urua, weddings generally lasted three or four days. The author was present

at one, and had an opportunity of witnessing the festivities. All the people in the

village were assembled. Some men blowing pipes and beating drums stood in the

centre of a great circle of people who danced around them, groaning and howling
and making a great noise. This was kept up day and night. Suddenly at the end

of the third day the bride came out of a hut dressed in all the finery the village

could muster. She wore a small apron made of a piece of linen which had been

given to the chief, and was adorned with feathers, beads, and shells. She was

carried on the shoulders of a very stout woman, and supported by a woman on

each side. She was brought into the middle of the dancing people and jumped up
Aand down on the shoulders of the woman.
                                          number of beads and shells were

given to her, which she scattered about indiscriminately, and the people scrambled
for them, as they were considered to possess some virtue as charms. The jumping
up and down of the bride was carried on so energetically that the skin was com-

pletely worn off the shoulders of the woman who carried her. Then the husband, a

great fellow, came in, picked up his bride, put her under his arm, and walked off

with her.

The resemblance between the African names Zambesi and Chambesi, and that

of a river called the Tambezi, suggested to the author the speculation that there

might be some connection between the language of that part of Africa and the

Malayan tongue. He could find no root for these words in the African languages.

The Malays had been in Madagascar, and this led him to the supposition that they

might have gone further west.

2. On the Native Races of the Head-Waters of the Zambesi.
                    By Major De Sekpa Pinto.

The author gave an account of the people of Bihe and some tribes on the west

side of the Zambesi River. The Bihe people are slightly cannibal, but never eat

each other except on great occasions. On fete days a limited number of people are

sacrificed and their flesh eaten, mixed with beef. The inhabitants of the Bihe"

Adistrict are not the original residents of that country.  hundred years ago it

was a deserted country. The son of the King of Humbe came north with a great

many followers to this country on a hunting excursion. An encampment was

formed. The prince one day met a princess of the north in his travels, and resolved

to marry her. She came to his camp, bringing with her a train of maidens. The

 irincess of the north, who was a daughter of the King of Andulo, coidd not long
Iie in her new country without having a following of her father's subjects who

were attached to her. In like manner the King of Humbe's subjects emigrated to

the north to live with the son of their king. Mixed marriages resulted, and the

race of Bihe" people were established under the native name of Muhumbes. This

was only 100 years ago. They have rude .manufactures in iron and fabrics. They

were able to supply the traveller with 15,000 rude bullets. He further described two
races who both live near the river Cuchibi, one a black race called the Ambuellas,

and the other the Mucassequeres, a white race. These races contrasted strongly

not only in their colour, but in then- form and feature. The most impressive

characteristic of the Mucassequeres is their extreme ugliness. Of the Ambuellas,

on the other hand, the author speaks in terms of admiration. Their eyes do not

retreat like those of the Mucassequeres, but are perfectly well set ; their noses are

finely shaped ; they have small mouths, and thin lips. The whole contour of the
face is well designed. The author spoke of another race, a little further south,
who, in the cultivation of their lands, were so far advanced as to avail themselves

of irrigation.

                  3. On the Native Races of Gaboon and Ogowe.
                       By the Comte Savokgnan De Beazza.

     This was a verbal communication in French, on the races which the author had

visited. He explained that the practice of cannibalism had been greatly exagge-
rated in descriptions of these peoples. He threw discredit on Du Chaillu's stories

of human flesh being exposed for sale in the villages, and of the dead from disease
being sold for food. They only partook of the flesh of their enemies killed in war,
and it was part of their religious belief that to e'at the heart of a brave would
increase their own valour. These maligned tribes were capable of the most gene-
rous sentiments, and in the case of the author, not only did they show no desire to
eat him, but they had shown him a devotion to which he owed his life. One day,
when his escort failed him and he himself fell sick, he was befriended by a Fan

chief, who, to procure him succour, put himself in the power of a tribe with whom
he was at enmity. He went to the hostile tribe to seek help for the sick explorer
whom he had left in the bush. The astonished hostile tribe were incredulous, and

feared an ambush. The Fan chief, determined to stick by his European friend,
offered himself as a hostage until the escort should return, and, by reason of some
delay in their return, was near forfeiting the life he had thus put in peril. The

-- --author also gave an account of a pigmy race the Akas who are not attached to

any place, but are a wandering people.

      The following Papers were read :

1. On the Forms and Geographical Distribution of Ancient Stone Implements
        in India. By V. Ball, M.A., of the Geological Survey of India.

     In continuation of some remarks made on this subject at the last meeting of
the Association iu Dublin, 1 the author gave an account of the results at which he
 had since arrived from an examination of all the available data. These are, that
the three classes into which the stone implements may be grouped occupy inde-
pendent geographical tracts, which overlap one another towards the centre of the

 peninsula.

      The geographical tracts, &c, characterised by the prevalence of one or other of
 the particular forms, when laid down on a map, show a remarkable coincidence
 with the limits of the areas of distribution of the non-Aryan races belonging to the
 several families whose waves of migration have contributed to form the lower

 strata of the population.

      Thus the manufacturers of the polished celts are probably identical with the
 Kolarian races who entered India from the north-east and Burmah.

     On the other hand the manufacturers of the flakes and cores of flint, chert, &c,
 appear to have entered the peninsula from the uorth-west, and may have belonged
 to the Dravidian family.

--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHKOPOLOGY.  395

     The identity of the manufacturers of the chipped quartzite implements which
are found in Southern India is less clear, but suggestions regarding it were also
offered by the author.

     The paper was illustrated by diagrams, showing the'principal forms of the stone
implements which have hitherto been found in India, by a map showing the areas
of distribution, and by some specimens.

2. On the Discovery of certain Pockets of Chipped Flints beneath the Peat on
  the Yorkshire Moors, near Halifax. By James W. Davis, F.S.A., F.G.S.

     The hilly country to the north and west of Halifax forms a part of the great
Penine Anticlinal, which extends from the borders of Westmoreland southwards to
Derbyshire. It is composed entirely of millstone grit rocks, except small exposures
of Yoredale shales at Todmorden and Diggle. Thick massive beds of sandstone
crown all the hill-tops, forming extensive plateaus with a regular dip towards the
south-east. This plateau is broken through by the river Calder and its tributaries,,
exposing still greater thicknesses of shale beneath the several sandstones. The
plateaus of grit rock are almost universally covered with heather and peat, the
latter averaging from six to twelve feet in thickness. On these moorlands, north of
Halifax, quarrying operations are carried on, and in the district about Warley Moor
and Fly-flats, 1,200 to 1,300 feet above the sea level, discoveries have been made of
numerous fragments of flint, evidently chipped from larger cores. They are found
beneath the peat, near the surface of the rock. There is no locality nearer than the
chalk wolds of East Yorkshire where the parent flints can be obtained in situ, and
this leads to the inference that they were carried to their present situation for the
purpose of manufacturing flint implements, and that this must have taken place a
long time ago, from the great accumulation of peat above them.

    3. On an elaborately finished Celt found on the Moors near Marsden.
                        By James W. Davis, F.S.A., F.G.S.

     Several years since a smoothly-polished axe-head was found on the hills about

a mile north-west of Marsden, whilst boring for an extension of quarrying operations.
It was found beneath a considerable thickness of peat on the surface of the rock.

The implement is flint, 5 inches long, 2£ inches broad at the cutting end, and 1} inches
thick about the centre, converging to a sharp edge at each end. The cutting edge
is considerably fractured by use.

   4. On some curious Leathern and Wooden Objects from Tullyrearjh Bog,
                       County Antrim. By W. J. Knowles.

     The author lately obtained from a workman some curious objects made of
leather. One is the greater part of the hide of some animal very roughly tanned,
out of which so many pieces have been cut of a diamond or oblong shape that what
remains looks like a wide-meshed net. It was found surrounding a wooden vessel,
made from a single piece of wood, and the thought has occurred to the author that
it may have been used for surrounding heavy objects that required to be carried. It
would be more suitable for that purpose, owing to its greater pliability, than a com-
plete piece of hide. The other leathern object was a lid for another wooden vessel,
also made from a single piece of wood. This vessel is still perfect, and measures

1 foot 4 inches in height, and is in diameter 1 foot 2 inches at top, and 1 foot

4 inches at bottom. The other vessel is broken up, but both contained, when
found, what the workman described as a creamy substance, which flowed away
when the vessels were taken out.
396 eepokt-- 1879.

     All these objects were found together during the time of cutting peat for fuel,
about two months ago, and about 12 feet from the surface. They appeared to have
been placed in a hole that had been excavated on the surface and then covered for
protection, but being forgotten or lost, they remained where they were, it is believed,
until 12 feet of peat accumulated over them.

          5. On Savage and Civilised Warfare. By J. A. Faeree.

     There is a superficial difference between savage and civilised warfare in their
tactics, weapons, and usages ; a civilised army does not actually worship a war-
god, does not mutilate its dead foes, nor sacrifice nor torture its prisoners, and it

generally spares the lives of women and children. Yet there is no such difference
as to make the expression ' civilised warfare ' other than the most flagrant con-

tradiction in terms. Warfare can no more be civilised than a circle can be a square.
Indeed, warfare is all the worse which claims to be civilised. The author traces
the effect of military necessities on the political and religious development of savage
races, and points out the links which connect modern warfare with barbarism.
Lastly, he discusses the question whether mankind will ever be sufficiently advanced
in civilisation to shake off the pursuit and lust of war.

                6. On the Origin of Fetishism. By Andrew Lang.
    Opposing Professor Max Muller's views, which regard Fetishism as a corruption

of a higher religion, the author seeks to prove that it is a primitive form of belief
in the supernatural, and represents one of the earliest factors in the development
of religion. The paper will be published in ' Mind.'

7. On certain Inventions illustrating the Working of the Human Mind, and
      on the Importance of the Selection of Types. By A. Ttloe, F.G.S.

     Desire to economise mental and mechanical labour is one of the great sources

of the invention of new thoughts. Nothing tends to save labour so much as using
a type instead of a number of individual cases. The mind is burdened with masses
of detail, and the system of types must be carried out for the arrangement of
materials for thought. One of the most important aids to progress of every kind
has been the art of choosing types. The invention of the Arabic numerals was a
striking example of a perfect type-system. Examples are given in which the same

kind of invention is applied to mental and to mechanical objects.

                                        8. On the Discovery of Animal Mounds in the Pyrenees.
                                                       By Dr. Phene, F.S.A., F.G.S.

The present discovery was very greatly due to the description given by Sir

Vincent Eyre, in the ' Athenaeum ' (July 24, 1869) of a remarkable custom of

burning living serpents at a particular spot in the Pyrenees. The author had long

intended to make a more complete exploration of these mountains than former
Mmvisits had enabled
                                        to do, and in this case he determined to investigate all the

districts around this spot of immolation. In doing so, he found in certain direc-

tions indications which always accompany these mounds. The churches abounded

in features expressive of the subversion of a pagan faith of which the serpent or

dragon had evidently been the representative, and with these were found built into

the walls examples of pagan Roman occupation, as votive altars, &c, &c. Follow-

ing the track where these were most expressive, he had come upon mounds as

distinct in form to an animal appearance as that presented by any of the American

mounds                                  they were altogether artificial,  and  shaped  into  an appearance of animal
                                     ;

outline so real as to seem like life. In the parts forming the heads, the chamber

had been appropriated, in one case by an arched chamber of Roman work, in
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  397

another by a descent of several feet into the body of a small church. On the spine
of the least molested one had been a tumulus in which, the cure of the church

informed him, had been found several of the most primitive incinerary urns, con-
taining- bones, Celtic articles, and above these, objects of the Gallo-Romano

description, and again above these, later or Christian Roman works. One of the

most interesting of the latter had been laid aside, and the cure sought it out for

--Dr. Phene amongst some debris ; it was the stem of an ancient cross, and on it

were sculptured serpents not in the usual position of subjection to a superior
power, but evidently as being in a condition of supremacy ; but as there were also
several dead ones represented, it might be that the sculpture figured the condition
of the real serpents before and after the ceremony of burning. Everything in the
district was emblematic of the serpent or dragon, and the mounds were distinctly

of such a form. On the mountains overlooking these mounds were a number of
stone circles, like those so well known in Britain. The description of these and
further details he reserved to meet a request, made by the representatives of the
American Congress at Brussels, to read a paper on the mounds of Europe. In this
last discovery he had the advantage of having some members of the British
Archaeological Association present with him, who also identified the exact resem-
blance of the mounds with life-like animal forms.

9. Evidence of Early Historic Events and Pre-historic Customs by perpetua-
   tion of design in art and manufactures in later, and even in present, times.

   By Dr. PhenS, F.8.A., F.G.S.

     The author admitted, in the outset, the difficulty of the subject, which he
thought had not yet been opened. The sources of information were few, and the
researches were consequently not to be pursued continuously, but caught up in

other investigations as they occurred. He thought a large amount of matter was

dormant in the hands of other inquirers, which, when a distinct channel was given
to it, would arise in discussion and be found of great interest. As the further we
go back in time the more difficult it is to identify causes or to determine events, he
proposed to give such evidence as he had collected inversely, and beginning at the
present to work gradually into the past, as by investigating familiar and existing
examples, the more remote might, when brought forward, appear less confused by

the mists of time.

    He selected first the works of ordinary artizans, and took as an example the
carpenter and joiner of the present day. He pointed out that in Western Europe

all their ordinary work was made in a rectangular maimer ; ordinary doors and
windows, for instance, were shown not only to be so formed, but designs and
sections alike always produced that which the artizan never contemplated as a part

--of his work, but which he unthinkingly perpetuated from his forefathers, viz., the

emblem of the faith of Europe the Cross. It would not do to say this was the
residt of the simplest mode of construction, because in Asia, and even in Eastern
Europe, it was argued with the same persistency that a curve was not only the
most beautiful, but the easiest and simplest form of construction. Of course, the
force of habit is great, and the artizan working continually in curved work finds it
much easier than one only accustomed to the square. But the work in India,
whether in plain solid work, such as had been taken as an example for Europe, or
the delicate metal work, was always curved or interlaced ; and the old religion of
India was that of the serpent. In Persia the circular was always contending with
the curved and the undulating design, and the contending religions there were the
sun and serpent. In Turkey the designs, as for instance of the dome of a mosque,
were formed of a series of crescents by omitting the intermediate ones of which
separate crescents existed, which appeared hardly capable of producing the design.
Every Turkish article, even to the oar and scimitar, was formed of more than one
crescent, and the Christian sword was as great a contrast as the French window.
Gothic and Byzantine work had been introduced among the artizans of Europe,
but it had failed to grow upon the soil, and was clearly exotic. The author gave
evidence that these arts were introduced by the Templars, the most cultivated
                                                              --;

men of their day, hut notoriously given to the old Pagan faiths, and who met with

symbols of the old faith of their Pagan forefather? in their contact with Orientals.

He considered there was abundant evidence from their design to attribute all inter-

laced work, and the sculptured stones of Britain and Ireland, to the influence and
designs of the Templars. They all perpetuated, directly or indirectly, the form of

--the serpent. The author then examined the art of pre-Christian Rome not in
--Rome itself, but in the countries where such art was significant of matters con-

nected with them in Gaul, Britain, the Campania, and others. In special countries,

and even in particular districts of those countries, the grand object of Pagan Roman

sculpture was the serpent or dragon. For example, the works of this class in

Provence were abundant, but though more and better preserved Roman remains

Tvere to be found of the same date in Languedoc, as at Nimes, there was no indica-
tion of the serpent. Other emblems, used as standards by Gauls and Teutons were

profusely shown in some of the early Roman sculptures in Provence, but they were

--nowhere perpetuated, showing that the great emblem the greatest of their stan-
--dards and, no doubt, therefore their chief deity was the dragon. It was even

adopted by the Popes in their dealings with Gaul, and in one notable instance they

-- --used only two emblems the eagle of pagan Rome and the dragon of Gaul and

gave equal honour and position to both, as a compliment to the people of both
countries, showing that these emblems of nationality were retained irrespective of

the new faith. He had referred so much to the serpent or dragon simply because

it was the most prominent object. The whole district he was treating of was

dragonesque. He had lately officiated himself at a great dragon ceremony, in

which the clergy of the district took the chief part. In this case, cakes in the
form of the dragon were distributed ; when the ceremony is abolished the form of
these cakes will not be understood ; all the ordinary loaves of the district were
formed like sections of a creeping thing like a caterpillar. Nothing of the sort
existed in the adjoining districts. The dragon was only appeased by the death of
children. These things strongly pointed to immolation to a serpent deity. There

were many other examples he could from want of time only enumerate. The
 schoolboy notches on a stick the number of runs at cricket ; in doing so he per-
petuates the old custom of the Exchequer. The baker of Brittany still notches a
 stick for the number of loaves he sells you, instead of making a bill. The milk and

 other tallies in England were till recently kept in the same way. This was, no
doubt, a very old custom amongst the Gauls, and he (Dr. Phen^) discovered in the
 former temple of Triptolemus, near Eleusis, two disused columns, the flutings of
 which, though rude and very ancient, gave the number of days of the week and
 month, in fact, formed a lunar calendar. Our schoolboys and Breton bakers of
 to-day had no idea they were perpetuating these ancient customs.

      The disc found on the forehead of Dr. Schliemann's cow's head, or Hera, had
 been perpetuated by Greek sculptors, apparently without the meaning, and had
 subsequently been represented merely by the concentric form the hair of a cow or
 bull takes on the forehead ; the exhumation of this antique showed it to have a
 special meaning. In the Persian mace he (Dr. Phent?) produced, the cow's horns
 were gilt, showing, though the meaning had been lost, that the horns were those
 of the moon. This agreed also with the horns of Schliemann's Hera. In a bronze
 head of Isis he (Dr. Phend) had lately found, the crescent was between the cow's
 horns, and this was evidently the original emblem from which the Mahommedans
 of to-day derived their crescent and star ; instead of giving a double crescent, as
 the horns and crescent if perpetuated would have done, they introduced the star

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

 but your Mahommedan, although scrupulous in praying at sunrise and sunset,
 would repudiate the idea that he worshipped Astarte or Isis, and does not know
 that he uses the special symbol of those deities. The success of Mohammed was,

 no doubt, greatly attributable to this emblem, as all these scattered worshippers,

 finding their own deity debased, gathered round his standard. This emblem was,

 as he pointed out last year, found in Ireland, on a cow's head, of which he gave an

  illustration.

                             TUESDAY, AUGUST 26.

     The following Papers were read :

     1. Tlie Profile of the Anient Greeks. By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

    Two theories have been propounded to account for the remarkable facial lines in

early Greek sculpture, one deriving them from Hellenic models, the other assuming
them to have been more or less ideal : and it is this latter view, in the absence of
any trace of the feature in modern Greece (except, perhaps in some of the islands),
joined with the fact that the ancient Greek crania are without the lines in

question, that is now most commonly accepted.

     The peculiarity in question consists in the absence of any nasal point, or, in
other words, in the continuity of the lines of the brow and nasal bone, and in the
close proximity of the mouth and nostril ; in addition to which the upper lip is
often curved, and the chin more or less massive.

    Now if any superior race in point of culture, and possessing these features, could be

shown to have had intercourse with the Greeks, when in a low state of civilisation
it would appear probable that the peculiarity was copied by them, rather than that
it represented any abstract ideal of beauty, or some divine attribute unconnected

with any living model.

    When then we find examples of the feature in early monumental frescoes, and

some of the more ancient crania from Egypt, in the portraits of Sidonians from the
tombs of the Pharaohs, and in the remarkable busts on the covers of the Phoenician
sarcophagi in the gallery of the Louvre at Paris, and the one from Sidon in the
British Museum, as well as in the terra cotta statuettes from Camirus, Panormus,
Tortosa, Calvi, Carthage, and other depots and towns established by the Phoeni-

cians, it seems probable that the early Greeks, who received their gods from the
Phoenicians, gave them the features of this remarkable race. With varieties for age

and sex, the images of the great gods in Greece all display the same facial lines.
Unfortunately there are no skulls of a sufficiently early date in Phoenicia to com-

plete the identification.

            2. On the Geological Evidence as to the Antiquity of Man.
                 By Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, M.A., F.B.8.

-- The evidence which Geology has to offer as to the antiquity of man is as follows
   In the Eocene age there were only families and orders of living mammalia, and

no living genera or species. It is, therefore, hopeless to look for man at this time
in the earth's history. In the succeeding or Meiocene age living genera of mam-

mals appear, but still no living species of mammalia.

     If the flints found at Thenay, and supposed to prove the existence of Meiocene

man, be artificial, and be derived from a Meiocene stratum, there is, to my mind,
an insuperable difficidty in holding them to be the handiwork of man ; seeing that
no living species of quadruped was then alive, it is to me perfectly incredible that

man, the most highly specialised of all, shoidd have been living at that time. The
flints shown to me in Paris by Professor Gandry appear to be artificial, while those
in the Museum of St. Germains appear to be partly artificial and partly natural,
some of the former, from their condition, having been obviously picked up on the'

surface of the ground. It is less difficult to believe theni to be the work of the
large extinct anthropoid apes then living in France, than to view them as the work

of man. The cuts on the Meiocene fossil bones discovered in several other

localities in France may have been produced by other agencies than the hand of

man.
     Nor in the succeeding Pleiocene age is the evidence more convincing. The

human skull found in a railway cutting at Olmo, in Northern Italy, and supposed
to be of Pleiocene age, was associated with an implement, according to Mr. John
Evans, of Neolithic age. Some of the cut fossil bones discovered in various parts

of Lombardy, and considered by Professor Capellini to be Pleiocene, are un-
doubtedly produced by a cutting implement before they became mineralised, a

point on which the examination of the specimens leaves me no reason for doubt.

I do not, however, feel satisfied that the bones became mineralised in the Pleiocene

age, and the fact that only one species of quadruped now alive then dwelt in Italy,
renders it highly improbable that man was living at this time. This zoological
difficulty seems to me insuperable.

     The only other case winch demands notice is that which is taken to establish
the fact that man was living in the Interglacial age, in Switzerland. The speci-
mens supposed to offer ground for this hypothesis consist of a few pointed sticks in
Professor Riitimeyer's collection at Basle, of the shape and size of a rather thin
cigar, crossed by a series of fibres running at right angles. They appear to me,
after a careful examination, to present no mark of the hand of man, and to be
merely the resinous knots which have dropped out of a rotten pine-trunk, and survived
the destruction of the rest of the tree. As the evidence stands at present there is
no proof, on the Continent or in this country, of man having lived in this part of
the world before the middle stage of the Pleistocene age, when most of the living
mammalia were then alive, and when mammoths, rhinoceroses, bisons, horses, and
Irish elks, lions, hysenas, and bears haunted the neighbourhood of London, and

were swept down by the floods of the Thames as far as Erith and Crayford.

3. On the Survival of the Neolithic Period at Brandon, Suffolk.
 By Sydney B. J. Skertchly, F.G.S., H.M. Geological Survey.

     This paper embodies the results of the author's researches into the origin of the

gun-flint trade, still carried on at Brandon, in Suffolk. From Palaeolithic times to

the present day this locality has been renowned for the excellent quality of its flint,

and during the Neolithic period flint was regularly mined for, just as it is at present.

A careful study of the methods of mining, modes of working flint, of the tools used,

and the implements made by the Neolithic and modern people reveals so many
singular coincidences that the conclusion is drawn that the working of flint must

have been carried on uninterruptedly in the vicinity of Brandon since Neolithic times.

This opinion is further strengthened by the absence of the similarities in question
from those gun-flint centres which are known to be of modern origin. The peculiar

phraseology of the Brandon flint-knappers is also pointed out, and the suggestion

made that some of these words may possibly prove to be of pre-Aryan stock.

     The points of similarity between the ancient and modern arts are briefly as

--follows :
    1. Mining. At Brandon flint is still mined for in a very primitive manner

In the neighbourhood the remains of extensive Neolithic flint mines, known as

Grime's Graves, are still extant, and a plan of one of these is like a bad drawing of

a modern pit. There are also numerous old pits, whose age is unknown, but is

certainly newer than Neolithic times, and they are sufficient in number to bridge

over the interval between Neolithic and historic times. Moreover, those pits which

are known to have been independently started about the time of the introduction of

flint-locks, are, in other places, worked upon modern, and not ancient plans.
--A2. Mining Tools.
                     very singular one-sided pick is used by the Brandon flint-
        --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.            401

diggers, which seems to be derived from the deer-horn picks used by the Neolithic
flint-diggers at Grime's Graves, of ·which a great number have been found.

   --3. Making Hammer. The flaking hammer used by the Brandon flint-knappers,

which is known as the English Hammer, seems also to have been derived from the
Neolithic hammer. The peculiarities of these tools are pointed out.

   --4. Implements. The strike-a-lights now made at Brandon are in many cases

precisely similar to Neolithic specimens. The gun-flints have clearly been de-
veloped from strike-a-lights. The manufacture of strike-a-lights was the connect-
ing link between the Neolithic tool trade and the gun-flint trade ; and as strike-a-
lights have nearly succumbed to lucifer matches, so have their offspring, the gun-
flints, nearly become extinct before the percussion caps.

     4. On the Stone Age in Japan. By Professor John Milne, F.G.S.

     The author describes, from personal examination, many of the archaeological

remains of Japan. Kitchen-middens are abundant. Lists of the shells and the
bones which they contain are given, and the character of the associated pottery is
minutely described. The middens are ascribed to the Ainos, and it is noticed
that the ornamentation on the pottery resembles that still used by the Ainos of
to-day. The stone implements found in Japan include axes, arrow-heads, and

scrapers. Many of these occur in the middens. The axes are formed generally of

a areenish stone, which appears to be a decomposed trachytic porphyry or andesite.
It is pointed out that the Ainos used stone implements up to a comparatively
modern date. Tumuli occur in many parts of Japan, and in some cases are asso-
ciated with traditions. Of the many caves in Japan some are artificial, and their
exploration promises a rich harvest to the cave-hunter. The paper also contains
references to recent geological changes in Japan.

5. On a collection of Organic Remains from the Kitchen-middens ofHissarlilc.
                      By Staff-Surgeon Edward L. Moss, B.N.

The author remarked that whatever opinions may be held as to the site, or

even as to the actual existence, of heroic Troy, there could be no question about

the extreme interest attached to the Walled Acropolis, unearthed by;Dr. Schliemann.
It occupied the very spot at that stepping-off place between Asia and Europe where

tradition had placed the ancient stronghold.

Dr. Schliemann had most liberally given him permission to collect some of the

bones which were exposed in every yard of the excavations, but the accumulations

were so extensive and of so many successive ages, that he had found it necessary to
restrict himself to those immediately overlying the old wall. They consisted of
charred and broken bones of deer, goat, sheep, ox, and boar, often marked by

--sharp cutting instruments, sometimes, as in an instance of a tibia of deer exhibited,

converted into implements worn astragali were common, and may have been used
in the well-known children's game. He had seen no human bones except those of

an unborn infant of about six months, enclosed in a pot with a quantity of, perhaps,

unidentifiable calcined bones.

Bones of dog and of a small carnivora, like a weasel, were, no doubt, acci-

dentally mixed up with the vestiges of the prehistoric feasts. Birds were repre-
sented in the collection by the tibia of a teal, and the leg and wing bones of a

wader.

The very abundant molluscous remains consisted almost entirely of the edible

genera now used everywhere on the shores of the Hellespont and ^Egean, namely,

Acockle, oyster, mussel, limpet, whelk, pecten, solen, petunculus.  trochus and a

bored columbella may have been used for ornament.

Most of the bones of pig were of young animals, in which the epiphyses had not

become attached. The antlers of red deer often had the tip of the brow-line sawn

off. They were generally cast antlers, or, at all events, knocked ofl near the cast-

ing time. Amongst vegetable remains tlie siliceous casts of large reeds, used to line
the plaster of houses, should be noticed. Masses of carbonised wood were not
uncommon, and carbonised peas or lentils were occasionally found in the domestic

vessels.

      All these remains occurred amongst quantities of rude potsherds,1 amongst

-- --which spinning whorls were conspicuous debris of stone and brick walls the

latter sometimes vitrefied as if they had formed the side or floor of a furnace. Dr.
Schliemann's half of the worked gold and bronze, found in the same layer, has
been generously deposited in South Kensington. The other half was the perquisite
of the Turkish Government.

                    6. On High Africa as the Centre of a White Race.

                               By Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.I.

     The object of this paper was to support a division proposed by the author
between the Aryans and the other white races of early historical epoch. Treating
the Akkad-Babylonians, Lydiaus, Canaanites, Etruscans, as the ancient types of
the non-Aryan white races, he proposed as modern representatives the Georgians,
Circassians, Armenians, Koords, Persians, Afghans, Greeks of Scioxa. The migra-
tions and historical incidents of the non-Aryan whites were, he said, to be accounted

for by a migration from Africa, and a habitat in High Africa. He showed that the

languages of the great states of Africa belong to a like class with the Akkad,

Lydian, Phrygian, Thracian, Etruscan, Georgian, &c. He referred also to the

community of mythological origins. The traditions of Abyssinia treated it as a
paradise, and the cradle of the world. To the white race he gave the name of
Turano-African ; and assigned to it the foundation of Egypt, of the great empires of

Asia, and the kingdoms of Southern Europe and Northern Africa, He attributed

to it not only a knowledge of North and South America and Australia, but also
the occupation of those regions, the evidences of which are found in their languages,
mythology, and monuments.

                7. On the Turcomans between the Caspian and Merv.
                            By Professor Aeminics Vambery.

     The Turcoman tribes inhabiting the western portion of the great Turanian
desert, though split up into hostile divisions, have never lost their purity of race
and language, and are Turks par excellence. They have avoided intermixture, and

retain the genuine Turkish physical type, not exhibiting the peculiarities of those

Turks who live in the noi-th-east of Central Asia and form a transition to the
Mongol race. The purest Turcoman type is found in the Tekehs (particularly the

Tchaudors and Imolis), whilst the Goklans, a fraction of the Yomuts, and the

Eusaris are the most degenerate. The Salars or Salors, a tribe now living to the
south-east of Mery, are the first mentioned in history, and next to them, the Guz

or Gozz, formerly living near the present Andkhoi.
     According to modern philology, the Turcomans are nearest to the old Selju-

kians and the Osmanlis of to-day, the affinity being striking both as regards
grammar and vocabulary : for instance, an Anatolian peasant can converse with

greater ease with a Yomut or Goklan Turcoman than with an Aza-rbajani Turk,
his near neighbour. It is supposed that the migrating Seljukians who founded

the first Turkish principalities in Asia Minor were a brother tribe of the Turcomans

who remained in their ancient seat, with gradual encroachments in its immediate

neighbourhood.

     The general characteristic of the Turcoman tribes is a surpassing love for a
wandering life, resulting in the avoidance of any change (except in two isolated
cases), owing to the influence of political revolutions or Buddhistic or Islamite
culture, which have affected the Kazaks and other Turkish tribes. Thus they
show a laxity in the observations of the Mohammedan tenets, and exhibit many

     1 Flint chips. (Flints are still used by the local housewife to grain her corn.)

remnants of the Shaman faith. Although superficially decidedly more savage
than the tribes to the north and north-east, many of the fine qualities of the un-
sophisticated primitive life of the Turkish race are retained by them.

     As to their number, it is believed that the figure of 1 ,000,000 is more likely to
be increased than diminished by any statistics possible. The Tekehs are now the
most numerous, and next to them the combined Yomuts of Khiva and on the
Gcirgan. Those of the ancient tribes who from their position first came in contact
with the political movement from Turan to Iran, were the first to diminish ; and
the Tekehs, heretofore sheltered by Persian anarchy, will now probably share the
same fate under the Russian supremacy. They have always been fierce soldiers

and dauntless adventurers.

     Nothing can                                        exceed the sterility and nakedness of the  Turcoman     steppes (Kara
                                                         Kizil-kuni, &c), which serve only as a    temporary    abode to the
Kum, Ust-yust,

Ivazaks, but are often used from necessity as a home by the Turcomans The
Yomuts in the south of Khiva have adopted a half settled life, tilling the soil and
attending much to irrigation. They would do so still more, if not too severely taxed
by the Khans of Khiva. Similar but weightier exactions have prevented the
Tekehs and other tribes from settling on the Atreck, and in similar localities suitable

for agriculture, and have given rise to devastating inroads by the Persians, repaid
by foraging and plundering expeditions called Alaman. 'But as the Kazaks,

formerly man-stealers and robbers, now permit unmolested intercourse to a certain
extent, there is no reason why the Turcomans, if properly met, should not also
abandon their cruel and plundering habits, especially as they still retain a rigid

observance of their plighted word. They also show family love, respect femafes,

practise hospitality, and have an ineradicable love of independence.

     In considering the question of the difficulty of the roads from the Caspian to
Merv, Professor Vambery is of opinion that the Turcomans will not be so easy for

the Russians to deal with as the Kazaks and Karchalpaks, though it required more
than a century before these were brought under subjection. The Tekehs, whose
country is now desired, are not only the most numerous but the most warlike of

the tribes                                              and unless  Russia  has  made  up  her  mind for a war  of extermination,
                                                     ;

Athe expenses of the present and any future campaign will be entirely thrown away!
    peaceful solution of the question, whereby the Turcomans would have their

independence secured as against Russia and Persia, would appear more satisfactory
and feasible than the use of force.

             By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc, fyc.

    A memoir was read by the author in 1877 before the Physical Section of the

Association ' On some new Optical Illusions,' some of which did not appear to accord
with any explanation hitherto offered. The illusions in question are those of the

subjective motion observed in apparent existence after the eye has for some time
been fixed upon a moving object, and which are executed, apparently in an opposite
direction. The most striking of these illusions are those produced by slight move-
ments given to certain patterns of lines and circles drawn in black upon a white
ground, and described in the author's memoir. The oldest illusions of apparent

motion are those recorded by R. Addams and by Brewster. While pointing out

that persistence of the retinal images failed to account for the production of these
illusions, the author abstained from advancing any completed theory until experi-

mental evidence was more complete.

       Quite recently Dr. Javal, Director of the Ophthalmological Laboratory of the

Sorbonne, has advanced an explanation of a different nature. He refers the pro-

duction of the subjective sensation of motion to small muscular movements uncon-
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHTSIOLOGT. 405

sciously executed by the eyeballs attempting to follow the real movements, and

continuing their unconscious slipping alterwards, so causing apparent motion in

objects that are really stationary. The theory of Dr. Javal, however, appears to

be untenable in the presence of two facts of capital importance : first, that the

illusion of apparent motion is confined to objects occupying that portion of the

visual field occupied before by the moving body ; secondly, that if two or more

simultaneous motions occur in different directions, in different parts of the visual field,

each produces its own illusive motion in a complementary direction, and all these

different motions appear to be going on at the same time. Thus, if a turning

spiral pattern be steadily regarded for some minutes, the gaze being directed at

the centre, the sense of rotation being such, that from all directions there appears

to be a movement of convergence to the centre, on turning the gaze to some other

object, that object appears to be enlarging and approaching.

The muscular- slipping theory is therefore out of the question, since the muscles

of the eye cannot slip in all directions at once : and if they slipped in any one

direction, this would affect objects over all the visual field, not over one region

only.

The theory which the author has, however, to propound is virtually a new law

of retinal activity. It is as follows : the retina ceases to perceive as a motion a Heady

motion of images that jjass for some time over a particular region ; and to a portion of
the. retina so affected, a body not in motion appears to be moving in a complementary

sense. It is a law analogous to that of the subjective complementary colours seen

after looking at a coloured body. It is analogous to other laws of nerve perception,

where we lose consciousness of steady phenomena, and become conscious only of

Achanges. Thus a steady sound of one pitch and intensity ceases to be heard.
Asteady light of one colour, as gas-light, ceases to be noticed as yellow.
                                                                            steady
--taste as that of garlic pervading every kind of food in some countries, ceases to

be perceived until it is perceived by its absence. The same is true of our percep-

tions of change of temperature. All these laws are probably only different aspects

of a much more general law of nervous perception. It is quite consonant with

these laws, that when any portion of the retina is affected by an image of objects

moving steadily in any direction over it that portion of the retina gradually loses

consciousness of the motion, and perceives it only as if at rest. When, however,

an object really at rest is looked at, to that portion of the retina thus affected the

fixed object appears in motion, but in an opposite direction. To the law expressing

this fact the author proposes to give the name of the Law of Subjective Comple-

mentary Motion.

   4. On the Comparative Osteology of the Arm. By Dr. T. P. Durand.

     The author, after referring to Martin's theory of the torsion of the humerus,
states his belief that in tracing the variations of the forelimb from the amphibia

upwards, two groups of animals may be distinguished. In one, including · the

Cetacea and Aves, the torsion is outwards ; in the other, including the Ernydae,
most other reptiles, and all terrestrial mammals, the torsion is inwards. The
exceptional forms of humerus observed in Monotremata, the Sirenia, Proboscidea,

and Pinnepedia are then treated at length. Due weight is given to the action of

muscles as a modifying agent in the form of the humerus.

                       MOXDAY, AUGUST 25.

The Chairman delivered the following Address :

    The Association to which we belong seeks to advance Natural Science, that it

to say, accurate knowledge of the material world, hy the following means :

    1st.--By bringing together men who are engaged in the various fields of science

indicated hy our several Sections, by promoting friendship between them, by giving
opportunity for discussion on points of difference, by encouraging obscure but

genuine labourers with the applause of the leaders whom they have learnt to

venerate, and by fostering that feeling of respect for other branches of science, that
knowledge of and interest in their progress, which chiefly marks the liberality of

scientific study.

  --Secondly. The Association provides funds, which, though small in amount, are

great in worth,  from  the mode of their distribution                                                                                                                and serve in  a  limited degree
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

as an encouragement, though not an endowment, of research. One proof of the

value of this method of subsidising unremunerative work by small grants distri-

buted by the master workmen themselves is given by the fact that the sum of 4,000/.

annually contributed by the Government of the United Kingdom for the endow-

ment of research is distributed on the same plan by a Committee of the Royal

Society.

The Third and most important aim of our Association is, ' to obtain a more general

attention to the objects and methods of Science, and the removal of any disad-
vantages of a public kind which impede its progress.' It is for this reason that the

Association travels from one to another of the great centres of population and intel-

lectual activity of the kingdom. Local scientific societies and local museums are
generated and regenerated in its path, local industries are for a time raised to a

higher level than that of money-getting, and every artisan mav learn how his own

craft depends upon knowledge'ot the facts of nature, and how* he forms part of the

great system of applied science which is subduing the earth and all its powers to
Wethe use of man.
                       wish to make science popular, not by deceiving idlers into the

belief that any thorough knowledge can be easy, 'but by exciting interest in its

objects and appreciation of its methods. In the popular evening lectures you will

hear those who are best qualified to speak upon their several subjects, not preach-

ing with the dry austerity of a pedant, but bringing their own enthusiasm to kindle
a contagious fire in those who hear them.

     Endeavouring to aid in these objects, I shall in this introductory address offer

you some considerations upon the bearing of Biology in general, and Anatomy and
Physiology in particular, upon national well-being and public interests.

     Biology is the science of the structure, the functions, the distribution, and the

succession in time of all living .beings. If the proper study of mankind be man,
he has learnt late in the inquiry ''that he can only understand himself by recognising
that he is but one of a vast chain of organic creation ; that intelligible human
anatomy must be based upon comparative anatomy; that human physiology can

only be approached as a branch of general physiology, and that even the humblest

mould or seaweed may furnish help to explain the most important problems of
human existence.

    The branch of Physiology which is concerned with man, not as an individual,
but a family, the branch which we now call Anthropology, is obviously re-

lated to practical Politics, and it was not without reason that the late illustrious

pathologist Rokitansky began a speech in the Upper House of the Austrian

Parliament on the Autonomyof the Bohemian nation with the words, ' The question
really is whether the doctrine of Darwin be true or no.'

     In another department, that of Psychology, the physiology of the nervous
system has already thrown more light upon the mysterious phenomena of con-

sciousness than was gained by the acutest minds of all ages without the help of
anatomical methods.

     All the improvements of modern Agriculture and stock-breeding rest upon more
or less perfectly understood scientific principles, and the more perfectly the residts
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 407

Lave been first worked out in the laboratory the more safe and the more lucrative

will be their application in the field. 1

     Still more important is the relation of Physiology to the national Health. The
commonplaces of hj'giene which are now, one may be thankful to say, taught, if

not practised, in almost every schoolroom and factory in England, are the direct

results of the abstruse researches of Boyle and Priestley, of Lavoisier and Pasteur

Ages of experience did not teach mankind the value of fresh air or the innocence

of clean water. Indeed, I have myself heard astonishment expressed by a German

professor at the peculiar immunity with which English skins will bear the daily

and unstinted application of soap and water.

If the art of keeping a community in health is but the application of plain physio-

logical laws, it is no less true that the art of restoring the health, curative, as

distinct from preventive Medicine, rests upon the same basis. In former days the

physician was one who recognised what he called the disease of his patient, who

referred to his books of precedents as a lawyer to his statutes, and who prescribed

Wea proper remedy to cast out the disease.    now know that dis-ease is, as the

name implies, a purely subjective conception. The disease of a host is the health

of the parasite, and we cure a human sufferer by poisoning the animals or plants

which interfere with his comfort. The same changes which in the old man are

the natural steps of decay, the absence of which after a certain age would be truly

pathological, are the cause of acute disease in the young. Pathology has no laws

distinct from those of Physiology.

    When these now obvious considerations are thoroughly understood, it clearly

follows that all ' systems of medicine ' are in their very nature condemned. All
that the art of Medicine can do is to apply a knowledge of natural laws, of me-

chanics and of hydrostatics, of botany and zoology, of chemistry and electricity, of

the behaviour of living cells and organs when subjected to the influence of heat and

of cold, of acids and alkalis, of alcohols and ethers, of narcotics and stimulants, so as to

modify certain deviations from ordinary structure and function which are productive

of pain, or discomfort, or death. It is, therefore, plain that rational medicine, or

keeping right and setting right the human body must rest upon a knowledge of its

structure and its actions, just as a steam-engine or a watch cannot be mended upon
general principles, but only by one who is familiar with their construction and

--working, and who can detect the source of their irregularity.

    An objector may say : ' Admitting that medicine is an art, it is a purely em-
pirical art. You cannot detect the origin of many of the maladies which you are

yet able to cure your best remedies have not been obtained by scientific experi-
                                                                                        ;

ment, but by chance observation and accumulated experience ; and if you doctors
would give more time to practical therapeutics, that is, to finding out what is good

for the several aches and pains we complain of, you would spend your time better

than in abstruse researches into microscopic anatomy or the properties of a dead

frog's muscle.'

The answer to the objection is an appeal to fact. For centuries, so called

observation and experience left medicine in the condition it occupied at the end of

the 17th century. The progress of therapeutics is to be marked, not by the labours

of 'practical men,' (who, by the way, are of all the most theoretical, only that

their theories are wrong), but by the, at first sight, unconnected studies of Des-
cartes and Newton, of Ilooke and Grew, of Lavoisier and Davy and Volta, of

Marshall Hall and Johannes Midler.

The history of science proves that unconnected, unsystematic, inaccurate obser-

vations are worth nothing. For untold ages men have had ample opportunities of

studying the indications of the weather, and have felt the utmost desire to obtain

a knowledge of what they portend. Yet it may fairly be said that nothing had
been done to the purpose, until combined and systematic observations were made

in this country and America. The fact is, that popular notions do not rest upon

experience or observation. They rest, with scarcely an exception, upon metaphysical

theories. In dealing with uneducated persons, both of the lower and higher ranks,

     1 I need only refer to the fruitful labours of Mr. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert in this

direction.
--408 REPORT 1879.

physicians find abundance of theories as to the nature and the origin of disease,
and of suggestions as to its cure. The only thing which would he of value is what

we can scarcely ever get, an accurate observation of what they see and feel. Every

fallacy of popular medicine, every solemn medical imposture, is the ghost of some
long defunct doctrine of the schools. Therefore, it is that common experience is
almost absolutely useless in all practical arts which, without exception, depend for
their progress upon the advance of science, that is, upon methodical, continuous
and scrupulously accurate observations and experiments.

     Many important advances in the practice of medicine have been gained by

direct and intentional experiments instituted with a therapeutical object. Such
was the Hunterian operation for aneurism, the process of skin-grafting, and subperios-
teal operations, such was the administration of chloroform and the introduction of
nitrite of amyl, chloral hydrate, and carbolic acid. Such direct experiments still
go on, and among them deserve mention for the skill and the untiring patience
with which they were carried out, those investigations upon the action of various
drugs upon the secretion of bile for which we are indebted to Professor Rutherford
and his coadjutors. Even apparently accidental discoveries were not made acci-
dentally. Hundreds of country surgeons must have been familiar with the cow-
pox, and have seen examples of the immunity it conferred from the more terrible

variola, but he who discovered vaccination was no falsely called practical man. He

was a man of science, the friend of Hunter and of Cavendish, an anatomist and
natural philosopher. The fruits of Jenner's discovery are spread over the whole
earth. This humble village doctor has saved more lives than the most glorious
conqueror destroyed, but his name is little honoured, and the only monument to his
memory has been banished from association with vulgar kings and skilful homi-
cides to an obscure corner of the great city, where his only homage is the health
and beauty of the children who play around his statue.

     But after all, it is not so much by direct and immediate contributions to the

art of healing that Physiology has vindicated her ancient title of the Institutes of
medicine, numerous and important as these contributions have been. It is still
more by the scientific spirit which has transformed the empty learning so justly

ridiculed by Moliere and Le Sage into the practical efficiency of modern surgery.
Let me give an instance of what I mean. The notion of measuring the temperature
of the body is simple enough, and the rough observation that in inflammation the
temperature is raised had led to the various terms by which it was denoted in
ancient medicine, and to numberless theories now happily forgotten. But although
the thermometer was well known, and had been applied by many scientific
physicians, notably by Be Haen, by Br. John Davy, and by Sir Benjamin Brodie,
yet the practical value of the clinical thermometer which now every practitioner
carries in his pocket was not understood until the other day. Those only who had
been trained in accurate physical and physiological investigations, who had learned
the worse than uselessness of ' rough observation,' were able to see the enormous
importance of clinical thermometry. This most practical of modern improvements
in medicine would never have been dreamt of by ' practical men': we owe it to the
scientific training of German laboratories.

      If Physiology is of such great national importance, if the necessity of experi-

mental research is so vital to the common national wealth, to agriculture and

commerce, to health and well-being, ought not its well-ascertained results to be

taught in our common schools, and its prosecution directly encouraged by the

State ?
     There is no question of the great importance of children being taught the rudi-

mentary laws of health, the bodily evils of dirt and sloth and vice, the excellence of

temperance, the danger of the first inroads of disease. Such teaching now broad-
cast in many excellent manuals as ' The Personal Care of Health,' by the late Dr.

Parkes, and Dr. Bridges" Catechism of Health' is no doubt extremely valuable,
and happily is daily mere and more diffused. But when beyond the direct utility

of such knowledge, we attempt to make it an intellectual discipline, there are, I
conceive, difficulties which will always prevent even elementary physiology from

forming an important part of general education. First, there is the practical
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 409

difficulty of the necessary dissections, next the impossibility of making physiology

demonstrative, and thirdly, the abstruseness of the subject. It is impossible to
have even an elementary knowledge of the laws of living beings without a very
considerable familiarity with those of physics and of chemistry, and even in medical
schools it requires all our efforts to prevent it degenerating into a mere dogmatic

statement of results, or a laboured repetition of hearsay statements. As an intel-

lectual discipline, for facility of demonstration, for the simplicity of the objects,
their beauty and interest, their associations with the green lanes and broad moors
of England, with the poetry of Gymbeline and Lycidas, with fairy tales and local

--folk-lore Botany is to my mind the branch of natural science which is above all

others to be chosen where one only can be taught. Next in importance I would
place Elementary Physics, the knowledge of the simplest laws of masses at rest
and in motion, of heat and light. Its great recommendations are its precision, its

constant and useful illustrations in daily life, the interest it gives to the handicrafts
and manufactures in which so large a number of English boys and girls are busied,
and the necessity of such knowledge as the first step in acquiring all other natural

sciences.

     First, then, I would that every Sheffield girl should love flowers with the deep
and abiding affection of familiar knowledge, and that every Sheffield lad should

know every common plant in your beautiful woods and find his purest pleasure on
the heights of Bell Hag and the broad expanse of Stanage Edge. And next I would
that your workmen and workboys should know so much of mechanics that they
may take an intelligent pride in your vast factories, and that in some of them may
be awakened the genius to which we trust to repeat in future generations the

national services of Arkwright, and AVatt, and Stevenson.

With regard to the endowment of research in Biology, I must confess that I

should be sorry to see it undertaken by government funds. That such investigations

are of public interest, that they are difficult and expensive, and that at present they

languish for want of adequate support, is all true. But this country is not so poor,

nor our countrymen so wanting in public spirit, that we need appeal to the national

purse to supply every ascertained want. Great as is the national importance of

science, the nation is more important still ; and even if that were the alternative, I

would rather that we should indefinitely be dependent on Germany for our know-

ledge than give up the local energy, the unofficial zeal which has made England

what she is. Far better for the strength and the civilization of the nation that a

thousand pounds were raised every year for the endowment of unremunerative

researches in this wealthy town of Sheffield, than that ten thousand were paid you

by a paternal monarch or an enlightened department.

But surely there is no need for us to go to Parliament for such sums as we

require. In the first place, scientific men themselves show a good example of not

asking before they give. There is the modest sum whicli we raise in this Association,

there are the funds for helping research of the Royal Society, the Chemical Society,

the British Medical Association, the Iron and Steel Institute, the Whitworth Scholar-

ships. Next we have the resources of our Universities, which have scarcely begun

to apply themselves to the task. I need do no more than allude to the Cavendish

Laboratory, or to the Physiological School, at Cambridge, where a simple College

tutor, of rare ability, and of still more rare sympathy and energy, has, in ten years,

achieved results which we need not shrink from comparing with those of the great

continental laboratories. The magnificent Museum of Anatomy, maintained by the

College of Surgeons almost entirely out of their own funds, is another instance of

private  care  for  science  to which we find no  parallel  abroad                                    and  the  Zoological
                                                                                                   ;

Society wisely spends a large part of its income in prosecuting Comparative Anatomy,

and publishing its beautifully illustrated Memoirs.

But beside the efforts of scientific bodies and the wealth of our national Uni-

versities, we may surely look to the public spirit of ancient companies and corpora-

tions to do something for the cause of science. In the middle ages our country
was covered with parish churches by private munificence : in the sixteenth cen-

tury most of our public and grammar schools were endowed ; in later times our

great religious and charitable societies were founded. May we not hope that,
--410

before the close of the present century, the discriminating knowledge which alone
prevents gifts of money from heing a curse instead of a blessing to a community,

may lead to the establishment of libraries, and museums, and laboratories by

universities and towns, which shall bear comparison, I will not say with those of

Paris, or Leipzic, or Bonn, but with the poorer but scarcely less distinguished

schools of Heidelburg and Gottingen, of Wurzberg and of Utrecht?
    Here and there we have institutions already under Government control and

patronage. Let them be maintained as efficiently and liberally as possible. The
British Museum and its Library, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the Royal

Gardens at Kew (happily preserved for the present from the short-sighted eagerness

of those who would destroy their scientific value), these are great national insti-
tutions of which we are justly proud. Successive Governments will have enough

to do to maintain their efficiency and to guard them from incompetent interference.

Whatever may be thought of the duty of the State directly to encourage the

pursuit of Animal and Vegetable Physiology, one would have supposed that at least

what diplomatists call a benevolent neutrality would be shown to a pursuit so

laborious and costly, which demands trained workmen and the devotion of a life-

time, which is so important for the national wealth and health, and which, by

reason, by experience, and by testimony, we know to be the only guarantee for

Whyadvance in the various branches of the healing art.  is it then that institutions

which owe nothing to government assistance, and men who spend their time and

talents in self-denying and unremunerative service for the public good, are not

suffered to pursue their beneficent work in peace? You know that certain persons
who profess to be shocked by the methods of physiological research have suc-

ceeded in placing this branch of science under as great disabilities as that sense
of humour would allow which so often redeems British ignorance from its most
mischievous results.

    The method that has given rise to so much excitement is the performance of
experiments upon living animals. Now, if this were injurious to the greatest good
of the greatest number of the community, or if freedom to perform these experi

ments interfered with tha freedom of other persons to abstain from them, or if such

experiments were forbidden by any religious or moral authority, by the Ten Com-
mandments or by Mr. Matthew Arnold, of course they must be given up ; but
equally, of course, the science of Physiology must also come to a stop, and the

farmer, the cattle-breeder, and the physician must be content with such knowledge
or such ignorance as he at present possesses. I know it has been asserted that the

science of the functions of living organs is quite independent of experiment upon

living organs. But this is said by the same persons who have denied that the
art of setting right the functions of the body when they go wrong has anything to
do with the knowledge of what those functions are.

     If you could be persuaded that Chemistry can make progress without retorts and
balances, that a geologist's hammer is a useless incumbrance, or that engineers can
build bridges just as well by the rule of thumb as by the knowledge gained in a
workshop, then you might believe that Physiology also is independent of experi-

ment.

      It is absurd to object to the difficulties of the research or even the contradictory

results sometimes obtained. The functions of a muscle or a gland are more com-
plicated than those of water or gas, and their investigation needs greater skill, more
caution, and more frequent repetition. Imperfect experiments can lead to nothing
but error ; criticism from other physiologists, or from scientific men experienced in

other branches of research, is not wanting and is always valuable. But vague
assertion that further progress is impossible by the very means which have led to

--all our present knowledge, coming from those ' who are not of our school ' or any

school, is undeserving of serious notice.

    The real contention of course is a moral one, that we ought to relinquish the

advantage of all experiments which are accompanied with pain to the creature

experimented on. The botanist may serve his plants as he pleases, and even the
animal physiologist may cut, or starve, or poison all sentient organisms which
happen not to possess a backbone, and he may try experiments with all backboned
                                                                   --

animals, including- himself and his friends, so long- as they do not hurt, hut that

must be the limit. On the most extreme humanitarian views no objection can be
made to experiments upon animals in a state of insensibility to pain, and as these

constitute, happily, the vast majority of physiological experiments, the question is
narrowed to comparatively restricted limits. Is it wrong- to inflict painful experi-
ments upon animals for the sake of Science ? In the absence of any authority to

appeal to, we can but judge of the matter by analogy. Now it has been the prac-

tice of all mankind, and is still allowed by the common consent both of law and
feeling-, that we should destroy by more or less painful means, that we should

enslave and force to work, and mutilate by painful operations, and hunt to death,
and wound, and lacerate, and torture the brute creation for the following objects :

for our own self-preservation, as when we offer a reward for the killing of
tigers and snakes in India ; for our comfort, as when we poison or otherwise

destroy internal parasites, and vermin, and rats, and rabbits. Our safety, our
food, our convenience, our wealth, or our amusement : all these objects have been
and are regarded by the great mass of mankind, and are held by the laws of
every civilised country to be sufficiently important to justify the infliction
of pain or death upon animals in whatever numbers may be necessary. The only
restriction which Christian morality or in certain cases recent legislation imposes
upon such practices is, that no more pain shall be inflicted than is necessary for the
object in view. Killing or hurting domestic animals when moved by passion or
by the horrible delight which some depraved natures feel in the act of inflicting
pain was until lately the only recognised transgression against the law of England.
I trust I need not say that it is only under such restrictions that physiologists desire
to work. 1 Anyone who would inflict a single pang beyond what is necessary for a
scientific object, or would by carelessness fail to take due care of the animals he
has to deal with, would be justly amenable to public reprobation. And, remember
it is within these limits that the whole controversy lies, for after a long and patient
examination of all that could he said by our accusers, the Royal Commission which
was nominated for the purpose unanimously reported that in this country at least
scientific experiments upon animals are free from abuse.

    What is deliberately asserted is that within the restrictions which all humane

persons impose upon themselves, it is lawful to inflict pain or death upon animals
for profit or for sport, for money or for pastime : that property and sport are in
England sacred things; but that the practices which they justify are unjustifiable

when pursued with the object of increasing human knowledge or of relieving human

suffering.

     Of those persons who answer that they consider vivisection for the sake of sport

to be almost as detestable as vivisection for the sake of duty, I would only ask
first that they should deal impartially with both offences ; and secondly, that since
in the one case their opinions are opposed to the practice of genteel society, and

in the other to the convictions of all who are qualified to judge, they should

at least contemplate the possibility of being mistaken. Putting the question of

field sports altogether aside, you know perfectly well that in every village in

England an extremely painful mutilation is constantly performed upon domestic
animals in no registered laboratory, under no anaesthetics, and with no object but

the convenience and profit of the owner. You remember how when an epidemic
threatened the destruction of valuable property, every booby peer now eager to stop,

so far as in him lies, the advance of knowledge, was no less eager to have carried
out at the public expense any slaughter and any experiments, painful or other-
wise, which would save his pocket.

    But you will say : all this seems reasonable enough ; but if so, how do you
account for the prejudice against you, what has induced so many amiable and

otherwise sane persons to join in the outcry against Physiology ?

   --First, I answer, it is due to the most frequent cause of folly Ignorance. Many

     1 They are, in fact, the very limits that were put on record by this Association
long before the agitation against Physiology began. See Pveport for 1871, p. 144.

persons supposed to be educated are so destitute of the most ordinary conceptions
of natural science that they do not understand the necessity for experiments. So
little do they appreciate tbe difference between formal knowledge and real know-

ledge, that a distinguished statesman once assured me that he would as soon have
his leg set by a man who had gained what he called his knowledge from books, as by
one who had ' walked the hospitals.' Next, there is the vulgar dislike of whatever
is not obviously and immediately useful. When knowledge for its own sake is in

question, those of the baser sort are always ready to cry with equal igncance of

literature and of science, Cut bono f
      In another class of persons, less ignorant and less stupid than these two, oppo-

sition to physiological experiments appears to spring from what may fairly be

stigmatised as Sentiment, that is to say, excitable, rather than deep feeling, uncon-
trolled by reason, People first gratify their fancy by calling cats and dogs our
fellow creatures, which, in one sense, undoubtedly they are, and then, by the
familiar fallacy of an ambiguous middle term, argue that it is cruel to put our
fellow creatures to pain ; or, as some would add, to reduce them to slavery, or to

use them in any way for our own, rather than their good. Such persons compel

their fellow creatures to drag them through the streets, they eat their fellow crea-
tures when sufficiently vivisected to be palatable, and they find philosophical
excuses for those who kill their fellow creatures for fun. But they are properly
shocked when their fellow creatures are hurt or killed for the benefit of mankind.
Such persons have been accused of feminine weakness ; but I must say that I have

never found an intelligent woman who could not see the rights of the case when
fairly explained to her, whereas I have met a few men who on this, as in other

matters, consistently refuse to give up to argument the notions which were formed

by prejudice.
     This sentiment is, I admit, the degradation of j ust feeling. To many unafiectedly

compassionate hearts there is a peculiar pang in thinking of suffering which is

deliberately inflicted, with only the justification of duty, instead of the excuse of

ignorance or passion. They see in the helplessness of the dumb animals an appeal

for pity, almost like that of childhood, and are justly indignant with the selfish
cruelty so often exercised upon them. All honour to the efforts which have

banished so many cruel sports from England ; all honour to the Society which seeks
 to prevent cruelty to animals. If it can point to any additional means by which
the sufferings of animals in the cause of Science can be diminished, we shall be
anxious to adopt tliem. If it can point to any abuse in one of our laboratories, we
 will hasten to correct it. This Society has honourably declared that they know of

 none. That physiologists have been heedless, or even callous, in their ex-

 periments upon animals in past times, when men were strangely insensible even to
human suffering, or in countries where a healthy result of Christian civilisation
 has not yet been seen in habitual gentleness to animals, I need not deny. Such

 cases have been eagerly sought and sometimes most unfairly judged. Only
 lately a learned body felt itself not strong enough to retain the admittedly in-

 valuable services of an eminent foreigner who had once admitted that when

 absorbed in scientific and beneficent researches he lost sight of any pain that might
 be inflicted. 1 Is not this the very excuse which is held valid in the case of sport?

 Doubtless we ought to be ever mindful of every branch of duty, but such occasional
 forgetfulness does not show hardness of heart. It is an excusable weakness for a

 student of medicine to shudder or to faint at the sight of blood, but he learns that
 this merely physical sensibility becomes selfish and mischievous if indulged : he is
 taught to suppress all such exhibition of emotion, and to let it stimulate without
 interfering with his efforts to relieve. But no one surely would think the hysterical

 vouth more truly humane than the surgeon whose compassion is shown in the very
 firmness with which he inflicts a temporary pain for an ultimate good.

      1 Fortunately, Dr. Klein, whose researches in microscopic anatomy and pathology
 are so well known and appreciated, knows that he retains the confidence and respect
 of his scientific brethren, and we hope that his honourable connection with the largest
 school of medicine in London will strengthen other and closer ties in binding him
  to England.

     I have hitherto rested the wbole argument upon the lawfulness of inflicting

pain and death upon the lower animals for the sake of science and humanity, but

as a matter of fact I may again assure those who, while assenting to the justice of
the plea, yet shrink from what it may involve, that the great majority of experi-

ments upon animals are rendered painless, and that the remainder are mostly those
experiments which are most immediately and directly subservient to medical art,

and which happily are generally productive rather of discomfort than of pain.

Let me give you an example of such a vivisection, far more painful than the

immense majority of those of the laboratory. Suppose a country surgeon were

sent for late at night to some case of urgent peril ; knowing that his ride is for life

or death, and unsparing of himself or his horse, he rides him to the utmost limits

of  endurance, and beyond                                                                                                                                    who would  not  applaud the  action ?  Those only who
                                                                                                                                                          :

appear deliberately to believe that our life is worth less than that of many sparrows,

those legislators only who look forward to the time when wars will cease, not

because of human slaughter, of devastated homes, of all the horrors which the

world has endured for centuries, but because of the cruelties to which the horses

in the artillery are subjected. We, who are familiar with human suffering and

sorrow, which our knowledge is all too feeble to prevent, best understand how

in testing some new remedy on a less precious fellow-creature than a man, one who

is truly humane may be tempted to forget the comparatively trivial suffering of a

rabbit or a frog.

    But some enthusiastic opponent will say, ' I cannot pretend to doubt that these

experiments are in every sense of the word useful, but we ought not to purchase

the benefit they confer by inflicting pain upon innocent creatures. I would sign a

petition to-morrow to put down all field sports by law, I would allow no opera-

tion upon domestic animals, and I will abstain from all animal food until I am

certain that I can eat creatures which have been killed without suffering pain. But

if I were lying at the point of death, and you brought an animal to my bedside and

assured me that by putting it to pain my life could be saved, I would refuse to pur-
Wechase it on such cruel terms.'
                                                                                                                                                             may hope that the excellent person who made this

heroic profession would in the hour of trial be better advised, but if not we may

surely reply, ' Bight reverend sir, you are the best judge of the value of your own
life, and if you think proper to sacrifice it to the comfort of a guinea-pig we must
submit to the loss with such resignation as we can muster ; but when you say that
in obedience to this silly whim you will let your dearest friend suffer, allow the

sacrifice of the most important life, and forbid those studies which have already

rescued multitudes from deformity and misery and death, then those of us who
have to do with the real responsibilities of life, and on whom presses the awful

sense of impotence to which our defective science too often leaves us, answer that

we too have duties to fulfil, and to the best of our power we mean conscientiously

to fulfil them.

    There is, I fear, another reason which animates much of the opposition to

physiological experiments. It is nothing else than aversion from the methods and

the results of science. It may be that an excuse for this dislike has been furnished
by the pretence of false science, and the arrogance of much even which is true.
But surely, no reasonable creature, from such trivial irritation, can deliberately

wish to check the progress of accurate knowledge by observation and experiment.
There are, indeed, some who, fearing (as I think prudently) that, while a little
knowledge inclineth men to Atheism, greater knowledge turneth them round again
to religion, and desiring to subject the human mind to a bondage as hard and more

degrading than that of mediaeval Borne, would gladly call off interest from the
unremunerative labours which are prompted only by the thirst for knowledge and

faith in the possibility of learning more and more of the divine order of the world,

to pursuits which bring obvious and material utility. There are those again, who,

fearing (as I think foolishly) that increasing knowledge of this Divine order will

lower our admiration of its beauty, or that the better a man understands the laws of
God the more likely he is to break them, have an unfeigned dislike for natural

science in general, and for Biology in particular. They repeat over again the error
of which the Dominican friars with far greater excuse were guilty when they im-

--prisoned Galileo. If any such are here, may I venture to tell them in quietness

and in confidence is your strength: the vast fabric of Christian morals is in no

dano-er of being overturned by the discovery of a new chemical method in the la-
boratory, or of a hitherto undescribed animalcule. If noisy attacks are made in the
injured name of science, you have only to wait, and you -will see these attacks
repelled by the true leaders of science themselves, or, at the worst, by the next
generation. But if, leaving your secure fortress of defence, you come clown with

your rhetoric and your sentiments, your petitio prineipH, your ignoratio elenchi, and
all your familiar fallacies and trope°, thinking that with such weapons you can meet

on their own ground meu who have spent their lives in the study of science, then
no wonder if you suffer grievous defeat. Happy for you if you learn, like another

discomfited pilgrim, to betake yourselves to another 'weapon.'

    But I imagine that some of my audience are saying: ' This defence would have

been necessary before the Royal Commission made their report ; but when that was

made, and affirmed the necessity of physiological experiments, and the groundless-

ness of accusations of cruelty against physiologists, when an Act was passed which
licenses physiological laboratories, under the very restrictions which you had already
imposed upon yourselves, may we not regard the controversy as closed, and the

result as satisfactory ? '

     I answer that I have taken up your time with this defence of physiological

experiments partly because I would fain help, however feebly, in the enlightenment

of the public conscience, but also because the result of recent legislation is not

satisfactory.

AScience does not work readily in fetters.  system of licenses and certificates,

numerous and complicated, obtained with trouble and delay, and revocable at the

will of a Minister who may, by the accidents of party, be at any time amenable to

anti-scientific influences, such a system adds serious difficulties to those already in

the way of experiments.

     Suppose, as au illustration, that certain persons opposed on various grounds to
learning, and especially hostile to Greek, had attacked the study of Plato. They

would point out the danger of modern ladies becoming as well read in his writings
as was Lady Jane Grey. They would show that the laxity of modern manners
was coincident with the popularity of the Symposium, and that the notorious

increase of infanticide was the result of the teaching of the JRepublic. Associations
for the total suppression of Plato would be formed, with hired advocates, and
anonymous letters, and ' leaflets,' spreading a knowledge of his most objectionable

passages. Scholars would be threatened with eternal punishment, and school-
masters with the withdrawal of their pupils. Then a Royal Commission would

be appointed-- a great Latin scholar, a Whig and a Tory statesman (who, having

taken a B. Sc. degree at Oxford, would be impartially ignorant of Greek), the most

intelligent despiser of Plato who could be found, the master of a grammar
schoofon the modern side, and (perhaps the most efficient of all) a lawyer, who

knew nothing about Greek but hated cant. This Commission would take evidence

that the Platonic writings were not all immoral, that they had been quoted with

approval by Fathers of the Church, that they were of great importance to litera-
ture and philosophy, and even to the elucidation of the Sacred Writings. It would

also be proved that* the Platonic Dialogues were far less immoral than multitudes of
other widely circulated books, and even than a French novel which one of the
Royal Commissioners happened to be reading, and, lastly, that the morals of Greek

scholars, and of clergymen who had read Plato at college, were not obviously
degraded below those of other people. On the other hand, witnesses would depose

that a knowledge of Plato was of no consequence to a student of philosophy ; that if it

were, the text was in so corrupt a condition that no two scholars agreed as to a single

chapter ; and that, after all, philosophy was of no practical use, least of all to clergy-
men. Others woidd affirm that though they had never read a line of him, they knew
that his style was as vicious as his sentiments ; and perhaps some cross-grained
scholar might be found who, having once edited a Greek play, would declare that
all studies in Greek literature ought to be restricted to the tragedians, and that for
his part he had never opened any other authors and had never felt the want of

them.

    At last the Commission would report that there was no question of the value

of the works of Plato, that it would be mischievous and impracticable to prohibit

their study, aud that there was no evidence that schoolmasters habitually chose

the least edifying passages as lessons for boys. Then what is called a compromise
would be made. It would be enacted that Plato might be read, but only in colleges

annually licensed for that purpose; that everyone wishing to read must have a

general certificate signed by certain professors,\ind setting forth his object, also to

be renewed   every                                                        year                              and  that                                                 special  certificates  might  be severally obtained
                                                                                                         ;

for reading certain excepted dialogues, for copying from them, for publishing them,

or, in rare cases, for translating them.

    However reasonably such a system might be administered, who can doubt that
the result would be a diminution of the number of scholars, and a check to the

progress of learning ?

Now this is what legislation has done for physiological experiments. The Act

Honourable gentlemen who had been taught from childhood to vivisect for un-

scientific purposes were eager to hurry off to their own merry vivisections, for

might be expected. Some shrink from seeing their names figure in disreputable

newspapers, and receiving more or less savagely abusive anonymous letters. Others
have no laboratories, and find difficulty in licensing their houses. Others are refused

the certificates they require.

In one case two thoroughly qualified men were anxious to carry out an important

investigation on the treatment of snake-bites. They procured venomous snakes

from a distance, and applied for the special certificates necessarv. Considerable

delay ensued                                                              various  objections                                                                         were  raised, and set at rest ;                                                                                       and  at  last  all the

certificates were obtained ; but meantime the snakes had died.

I must apologise for having detained you so long. The whole history of this

controversy is melancholy but instructive.

    To those of my audience who wish well to Science, I hope that I may have

made more clear the grounds on which vivisection is necessary and right, and thus ful-

filled one of the chief objects of the Association--' to obtain the° removal of any

disadvantage of a public kind which impedes the progress of science.'

To those working physiologists who have honoured me by their presence I would

express the assurance that they have the confidence and the gratitude of the medical

profession, witnesses at once competent and impartial, who know the difficulties
and the value of such labours
                                                                                                                                                                   ;  and as to present  discouragements, looking back to

the obstacles which so long retarded the progress of our kindred science, Anatomy,

    When, in the earliest years of the Royal Society, Sir Christopher Wren and
Dr. Lower made those experiments on transfusion of blood which have at last proved
so beneficent, there were not wanting shallow witlings who scoffed at their re-

searches. It was of them that Cowley wrote with a just, indignation

                 1. Experiments on Septic Organisms in Living Tissues.

                      By Staff-Sargeon Edward L. Moss, B.N.

     In 1874 some attempts to preserve meat in a state tit for dietetic purposes, and
apparently some suggestion from the eminent German, Surgeon Bilroth, induced
Professor Tiegel to undertake a series of experiments with tlie intention of deciding
whether septic organisms exist in the living tissues.

     With this object Dr. Teigel sealed up various parts of the bodies of newly-slain
rabbits by dropping them into melted paraffin at a temperature assumed to be high

enough to destroy any infection they might receive in transit from the animal's

body to the dish of paraffin. He found that, in most instances, the unheated

centre of his lumps of flesh became in a few days putrid and swarming with

bacteria. 1

     This result was so striking that his experiments were repeated by Dr. Burdon
Sanderson,2 with the oidy difference that the red kernel of uncooked tissue dlivays

contained bacteria, whereas Teigel's results were not so uniform, as may be seen

by his reply to Professor Klebs in a number of Virchow's ' Archives ' following the
paper summing up his experiments.

     On the other hand, Messrs. Cliiene and Cossar Ewart reached a very different

conclusion after a course of similar experiments, in which, however, they laid
special stress on the use of an additional precaution in the shape of antiseptic
spray. 3 But the action of a bactericide cannot be limited to defence only, and
their experiments woidd have been more convincing if the pieces of meat had not
been exposed to an agent capable of penetrating the flesh and killing or arresting

the growth of any bacteria it may have contained. If, however, meat sealed in

air pure and simple will remain unputrefied, it is fair to conclude that the frag-
ments so remaining are free from the special organisms that cause putrefaction.

     In the winter of 1875, 1 sealed up a piece of musk-ox meat in clean Arctic air,
and it remained perfectly fresh until the glass tube containing it was accidentally
broken thirteen months afterward. In this case any sources of putrefaction which

may have existed in the flesh were possibly destroyed by the low temperature to
which it had been exposed. On looking up what had been written on the subject

I found the accounts of the experiments just referred to, and it appeared worth

while to try whether flesh woidd keep equally well if removed warm from the body

of a recently killed animal and simply sealed in an atmosphere whose freedom from
life could be guaranteed.

     Availing myself of the facilities afforded by the laboratory of the Royal Dublin
Society, I led a pipe from the nozzle of a well-weighted blacksmith's bellows,
through a tube of hard glass six feet long well packed with platinum foil, and
heated to redness in a Hoffmann combustion furnace. I thus obtained a stream of
air at the rate of 70 cubic feet an hour at a temperature which quickly singed
cotton-wool, and varied during the operation between 380° and 420° Fahr., as was

--shown by a thermometer let into the outflowing end of the tube a brass pipe, first

thoroughly cleansed by heating to redness, was surrounded by a freezing mixture
and served to cool the current to a temperature between 70° and 80°.

     In the air thus obtained I removed pieces of flesh from the dorsal muscles of a

-- --decapitated rabbit using a scorched knife and forceps and sealed them in glass

tubes cleaned by heating to redness, and through which a current of the sterilised
air was kept flowing until the fragments were put in. In order to close the tubes,
the wider end of each was first stopped with well-baked cotton wool, the narrower
end then fused off from the branch-pipe conveying the current, and, finally, the
space of tube between the stopper of cotton wool and the flesh was fused, drawn
out, and closed.

     Three tubes containing muscle, and one with brain, were thus hermetically

sealed, ancTtwo others, each containing muscles, were (being found rather too short)
left closed with cotton-wool only, which, for security sake, was afterwards covered

with a cap of resin and wax cement.

The tubes were filled and sealed on September 2, 1878, and left in a tempera-

ture averaging 60° Fahr. On the 9th, tubes Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, containing muscle,

showed minute hairs of mycelium projecting in one or two places from the flesh.

In Nos. 1, 2, and 3 the mycelium never fruited, but disappeared with an increase

                                                                                                              which was one of those stopped with
wool only--it fruited into a yellow-headed mucor and then disappeared in a

softening d<§bris of evidently putrid flesh. I opened the tube, its contents were

foetid and held myriads of active bacteria, large and small.

The brain remained quite unchanged for ten days, and then suddenly softened

and broke down, thus leaving but one of my six specimens intact. On my return
home, a few days ago, I found this one altogether unchanged, and I embrace this

opportunity of exhibiting it, a piece of muscle which appeared to have neither held

or received infection.

      Although Nos. 1, 2, and 3 developed mycelium and extruded a quantity of

 slightly glairy fluid almost equal in bulk to the flesh, it is remarkable that they did

 not become putrid. I opened one of them three days ago ; it had an odour like

boiled rabbit and catchup, and was most decidedly not offensive. It, like the
others, was speckled over with white aggregations, which I at first thought were
fungoid, but on examination found to be bunches of acicular crystals entirely
organia They are insoluble in alcohol or ether, like creatin, but only slightly

soluble in warm water. They dissolve in sulphuric acid without blackening. I

had not enough of them to examine further. I could not find any bacteria in the
fluid, and it was decidedly free from any in an active condition.

     The apparatus not being portable, circumstances rendered it impossible for me

to continue experiments on flesh ; but 1 endeavoured to follow up the subject of

septic organisms in living tissues by observations on blood removed from human
veins, by a method which appears to exclude possibility of infection, and at the
same time allows the blood to be examined at different intervals, so that germs, if
any exist in it, may be cultivated and studied with convenience.

     The apparatus consists of a series of small glass bidbs connected by capillary

tubes, so that one bulb and its contents can be separated from the rest by fusing
and drawing out the connecting tube in the flame of a blowpipe.

     The tubes and bulbs are bent on each other, so that the whole series can be
readily baked in a water or paraffin bath. One end of the series is left open,
packed with baked wool, and connected with an aspirator. The other is drawn to a
fine point and sealed. Then the sealed point is enclosed and secured in a short

piece of stout indiarubber connection-pipe, which, in its turn, is fastened over the

collar of a fine hypodermic needle, protected ready for use in a calcined glass

sheath.

 When connected, the    whole                                                                             arrangement  is  baked  repeatedly in  a water-bath

_

at intervals of four hours. (Mr. Dallinger's septic organism required 5£ hours for

its life cycle. Oossar Ewart's bacillus anthracis produced spores in 24 hours.)

The apparatus is then ready for use. The mode of procedure is as follows :--The

sheath is removed from the needle, and the latter is plunged into any suitable vein

--the radial is a convenient one. The sealed point inside the rubber connection

tube is broken, and blood flows gently through the series of bulbs drawn on by the

aspirator acting through the cotton plug. When sufficient has entered, the flame

of a blow-pipe severs the capillary tube next the needle, and instantly afterwards

the similar tube next the wool plug.

    The apparatus is easily used. I have repeatedly obtained blood from my own
arm without assistance. No inconvenience follows the puncture of the vein if the

needle is kept steady and a little care exercised to prevent extravasation.

    By adopting this method I have constantly, after the lapse of 48 or more
hours, found organisms in the blood of intermittent fever which I was altogether

unable to find in the fresh blood. They consist of bacterine pairs or single indi-
viduals in active locomotion, sometimes stationary in zooglea groups, and occasion-

method in blood a month sealed.

     I have as yet not had sufficient opportunities of experimenting with blood

absolutely free from possibility of malarial infection to speak with certainty about

the  development of  organisms  in  healthy blood                                                        but so far  as  my experience goes

the appearance after a few days of bacterial bodies with more than Brownian

motion, which most decidedly do not exist in fresh blood, is the rule rather than

the exception.
     I have not, however, found any samples of blood subject to a definite sponta-

neous putrescence. The only change apparent is that the serum, at first of a faint
greenish tinge and opaline, becomes more transparent and acquires a crimson

colour.

                          By L. C. Wooldridge, B.Sc. Land.

   A new method of preparing stroma by means of dilute sulphuric acid was de-

scribed, the advantages of which were, that it gave a stroma retaining perfectly
the shape of the original corpuscle, and that it was a very expeditious method.

     The Stroma itself consists of

      1. Globulin.

    2. An albumin, probably alkali albumin.
    An3. albuminoid body, containing phosphorus ; soluble in dilute soda, insoluble

in dilute acid, and insoluble by digestion with artificial gastric.

   A4. crystalline body, extracted by ether, which is not fat or cholesterin, nor

does it contain any phosphorus ; its other properties have not yet been investigated.
     The research was mostly carried out under the supervision of Prof. Drechsel, in

Prof. Ludwig's Laboratory, at Leipzig.

 4. The Nervous System of Comatula. By P. Herbert Carpenter, M.A.

     Although there is a close histological resemblance between the ambulacral
nerves of the starfishes and Crinoids, there is one important point of difference
between them. The ambulacral nerves of the starfishes, at any rate of the Ophiurids,
send off branches to the muscular bundles which connect successive joints of the
rays, and effect the movements of the animal. The swimming movements of
Comatula are far more active than the movements of any starfish, and are also
performed with a singidar regularity, while they are effected by the combined
contraction of several hundred pairs of muscles ; but no branches are traceable
from the ambulacral nerves on to these muscles, such as are known in the Ophiurids.

     Dr. Carpenter's experiments at Naples have shown that these muscles are under
the influence of a governing centre which not only regulates their contractions,
but co-ordinates these contractions in the most remarkable manner ; and that this
centre is situated in the fibrillar envelope of the chambered organ, while the axial
cords of the rays and arms are the channels by which the influence of the centre is
communicated to the muscles.

      This experimental evidence as to the nervous nature of the axial cords is further

supported by the results of anatomical investigation. Sections show that these
axial cords give off branches regularly in the centre of each segment of the arms
and pinnules ; and that while some of them ramify upon the ends of the muscular
bundles, others are traceable into the small marginal leaflets bordering the ambu-
lacral grooves, where they break up very minutely and become lost. It has also
been discovered that in many tropical Comatula, which have an excentric mouth,
   --RANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 419

more or fewer, sometimes even more than half of the arms, which come off from
the aboral side of the disc, have no ambulacral nerve at all, although the dorsal
axial cord gives off its two pairs of branches in the usual way. In one large
species from the Philippines, with nearly 200 arms, this condition is not limited to
the aboral arms only, but occurs on some of the arms on each radius, while the
others have the usual groove and subjacent ambulacral nerve.

      These facts are strongly indicative of the nervous nature of the axial cords,

although Olaus and Gegenbaur in their recently published text-books make no
mention of this view at all, and describe the nervous system of Comatula as essen-
tially similar to that of the starfishes. It would seem, however, that while the

ambulacral nerve of the Ophiurids supplies the muscles as well as the tentacles,

these functions are more differentiated in the far more active Crinoids. The axial
cords of this group appear to be the principal motor nerves as far as the skeleton

is concerned, while the ambulacral nerves supply the tentacles only, possibly having
some influence on the slow creeping movements which the isolated disc has been

observed to perform. Why should we deny the nervous nature of the axial

cords, simply because our doing so would clash with our preconceived notions as
to what the Crinoids ought to be, in order to agree with the views on Echinoderm
morphology which were adopted without a sufficient knowledge of the anatomy
of this most interesting group ?

        5. On a Visual Phenomenon and its Explanation.
                       By William Ackkotd, F.LG.

Visual phenomena are of general interest, and have been noticed by Brewster,

Herschel, and others. The following is the visual phenomenon in question: a

globule of water is made to impinge on the cornea, whilst the gaze is unwinkingly

fixed on a distaut light. Directly after the impact the light appears to be sur-

rounded by a luminous ring, which gradually contracts in diameter. Explana-

Ation:  minute ripple is produced on the surface of the cornea. The crested

wave-ring and the refracting media of the eye produce two hollow cones of light

within the vitreous humour, one with a circular portion of the crystalline lens as

base, and the other with the retina as base. As the ripple increases in diameter,

the first cone increases in size, and its prolongation (the second cone) diminishes,

and its base (in other words, the visible luminous ring), becomes less and less,

until it merges into the lamp-light itself.

President of the Section-- Clements R. Markham, Esq., C.B., F R S., F.L.S.r

                                                     Sec. RG.S., F.S.A.

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 1879.

      The President delivered the following Address :

                                                    Part I.

     I propose to open the proceedings of this Section by attempting to place in a
clear light the objects and aims of geographers, and the position which their science
holds relatively with reference to the other sciences, and positively as a distinct
body of knowledge with defined limits.

     Geography is a knowledge of the earth as it is, and of the changes which have
taken place on its surface during historical times. These changes explain to us the

laws according to which similar changes are now taking place around us. The
subject may be considered from various points of view ; but my present endeavour

will be to introduce to you, through the remarks I propose to make, the papers
that will come before you to-day and at our subsequent meetings. I shall tiy to
do this by explaining the practical uses of geographical knowledge, and its import-

ance to usi p a1 most every occupation in which we may be engaged.
     Our firs I work as geographers is to measure all parts of earth and sea, to

ascertain the relative positions of all places upon the surface of the globe, and to
delineate the varied features of that surface. This great work has been proceeding
from the first dawn of civilisation, and it will probably be centuries longer before
it is completed. Geographers and explorers, surveyors and geodesists, of each

generation, work their allotted time, gradually increasing the stock of human
knowledge, by enabling other sciences and other branches of inquiry to make

parallel advances. For they are all dependent on the accurate measurement and

mapping of the earth. Locality is the one basis upon which all human knowledge
must rest. Arts, sciences, administration, commerce, depend upon accurate geo-
graphical knowledge ; and as that knowledge becomes more extensive and more
 exact, so will every other human pursuit gain increasing light and truthfulness.

    We are still very far indeed from an accurate scientific geographical knowledge

of even the most civilised countries, while by far the largest portion of the earth's
surface is inadequately surveyed, and a smaller, though far from inconsiderable,
part is unsurveyed or entirely unknown. In the division of labour, the geodesist
produces the accurate large-scale maps which are necessary in thickly populated
countries, the topographical surveyor furnishes less exact maps of more thinly
peopled and less civilised regions, while the trained explorer forces his way into
the unknown parts of the earth.

     From the labours of these three classes of workers we, in this generation, and
our descendants for many generations to come, must be content to derive our
 knowledge ; but in the fullness of time the whole earth will be measured and
 delineated as Hallamshire is now. It is to the furthering of this great work that

 the geographers of each age devote their energies, and its advancement will
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                421

increase in rapidity, because, as men become better instructed, there will be more

geographers.

     The construction of large scale maps on rigorously accurate principles has as
yet made inconsiderable progress. It is only in the countries of Europe, in India,
and some of our colonies, and in the United States that it has been commenced.
But it is very far from being completed anywhere, and the people of Sheffield have
had this fact brought home to them within the last year ; for the Memoir on the

Yorkshire Coal Field, published by the Geological Survey in 1878, was obliged to

stop short with the limits of the county, an artificial and inconvenient line which

leaves the southern portion of the field undescribed, entirely because the six-inch
survey had not yet been extended over Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. This

circumstance strikes us in two ways. It reminds us that geographical work is far
from being completed even in the most populous and civilised parts of our own
country ; and it also brings the fact home to us that the progress of other sciences
is dependent upon the advance of geography.

     Where the trigonometrical surveys have not been commenced, we have only
those maps which are based on positions fixed by astronomical observations, on
cross-bearings and chained distances, and which I call (to distinguish them from

the results of trigonometrical surveys) the topographical maps. One of the oldest
and most interesting of these maps is the famous atlas of the Chinese Empire
constructed^ the Jesuits between 1708 and 1718. But we are also dependent on
such maps for our geographical knowledge of all Asia except India and Palestine,

of the Eastern Archipelago, of all Africa and South America, and of the greater
part of North America.

 Accurate     maps  are  the basis of  all  inquiry conducted  on  scientific principles.

_

Without them a geological survey is impossible; nor can botany, zoology, or

ethnology be viewed in their broader aspects, unless considerations of locality,

altitude, and latitude are kept in view. Not only as the basis of scientific inquiry,

but also for the comprehension of history, for operations of war, for administrative

purposes, and for the illustration of statistics, the uses of accurate maps are almost
infinite. M. Quetelet, in one of his well-known letters, declared that such graphic

illustration often afforded immediate conviction of a point which the most subtle
mind would find it difficult to perceive without such aid. Maps both generalise
and allow of abstraction. They enable inquirers at once to detect and often to

rectify errors, which, if undetected, would affect results and throw calculations into
confusion. As an example of the use of maps for administrative purposes, the

series constructed by Mr. Edward A. Prinsep in India is worthy of notice. They
showed the agricultural tribes of a special district arranged according to occupancy

of land, political and fiscal divisions, physical features and zones of fertility, produc-
tive power as influenced by rain or aided by irrigation, different kinds of soils, acres
under different kinds of produce, and lines of traffic. Another most instructive

series displays the State irrigation canals acting on improvable waste lands, the
depth of wells, the rainfall and zones of drought, and the parts of the country

already irrigated. As another noteworthy instance of the use of maps for statistical
illustration, I may mention the interesting ' Carte agricole de la France,' by M.
Delesse, which not only shows the extent of arable, meadow, and vine lands, and
of woods, but the relative value of land by shades and contour lines of equal
revenue. The idea has been adopted by Mr. Ralph Richardson in his map of Mid-
Lothian showing the annual rentals by colours ; and of course the colours also

indicate the positions of barren mountains, of fertile valleys, and of centres of

population. Such maps ought to be far more extensively used than is now the
case, for in no other way can economic and industrial facts be so lucidly and

clearly, as well as so rapidly, impressed on an inquirer's mind.
     The third division in which geographical delineation is classed is that comprised

in the labour of pioneer-exploring and discovery. This branch of our subject ex-
cites the most interest, because the heroic devotion and gallantry of our travellers
is a source of just pride to the nation; and because their perils and hardships,
their adventures and discoveries surround them with a halo of romance. Yet
these romantic associations are not confined to the pioneers of geography. Though
--422

less known, they equally belong to the more scientific geodesist. In the whole
range of exploring narrative there is nothing more calculated to excite admiration,,
nothing more touching, than the devotion of Colonel Lamhton, the first superinten-

dent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, the old man who was absorbed
in his great work for half a fife-time, who wasted away from exposure and hard-
ship, but who, to the last brightened up to renewed animation and vigour when
the great theodolite was before him, and who died at his post in a wild part of
Central India. This was sixty years ago, but quite recently the equally heroic
death of Captain Basevi was recorded. At 17,000 feet above the sea, in a tempera-

ture below zero, and protected only by a light tent, this martyr to science was en-
gaged in the delicate operation of swinging the seconds pendulum. One morning,
when gallantly striving to rise from a bed of suffering and to recommence work,
he died. Nor do these names stand alone. Assuredly, the more scientific sur-
veyors run equal risks, and deserve equal recognition with their exploring brethren.
Still the interest justly attaching to new discoveries naturally commands most
popular applause, and the importance of opening up an unknown country cannot

well be exaggerated.

      In this glorious field there are still harvests to be reaped through the bravery
and endurance of future travellers. In spite of all that has recently been done in

Africa, there is a vast unknown tract to be discovered. In Asia, in New Guinea,

in Sumatra and Borneo, in South America, wide regions also remain unexplored.
Above all, the greatest problem of this age awaits solution in the far north, and

will call forth the best scientific ability, and all the highest qualities of our naval

explorers.

     Every year, new regions are brought within our knowledge, and we are able to
welcome the adventurers home, and to add them to the list of geographical worthies.
But, with regard to many explorers, there can be no doubt that much more valu-
able information might be obtained than is now the case. Men, with various
avocations, traverse unexplored or little known countries, who, from want of
previous training, are unable to lay down their routes or to observe with scientific

accuracy and intelligence. There are naval and military officers, missionaries, con-

'sular agents, colonial officials and planters, engineers, telegraphers, collectors, and

sportsmen or persons merely travelling for pleasure, many of whom are led, by

business or curiosity, to penetrate into regions of which little is known. It is
most important that there should exist, in this country, the ready means of furnish-
ing the necessary training to such explorers, and the subject has recently received

 serious consideration froni the Council of the Royal Geographical Society.
      It has been resolved that a course of instruction shall be sxipplied by the

Society to all who are about to visit unknown or little known countries, and who
desire such training. As a preliminary measure, the present arrangement is to

 give such instruction as will enable the pupil to fix positions by astronomical ob-
servations, and to lay down his route ; but this is only a beginning, and it is to be
 hoped that, in due time, such a course of instruction will be provided as will enable
an intelligent traveller to observe with scientific accuracy, and to bring home really

 valuable results in various branches of inquiry. It is very desirable that this reso-

 lution of the Geographical Society should be widely known, and I trust that the
 local members of this Section will co-operate so far as to bear in mind that this
aid is offered by the Geographical Society, when the intention of any native of
 Hallamshire to visit a distant region comes to their notice. Incalculable good

may be done to the cause of geography by a system which will have the effect of

 making every traveller a scientific and intelligent observer.
      The surveying and mapping of the ocean is only second in importance to that

 of the land ; and this work also divides itself into three sections, namely, the
 coasts surveyed, the coasts partially surveyed, and the unsurveyed coasts. Hydro-
 graphy will not be completed until all the coasts in the world are included in the
 first section, which is now very far indeed from being the case. Yet this is not
 merely a question of science, of the study of the physical geography of the sea,
 interesting as this branch of our subject has become. Upon the accuracy and

 completeness of charts hangs the safety of thousands of lives, and the prosperity
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                       423

of commerce in all parts of the world. When it is remembered how much

depends upon the work of marine surveys, it must he a subject of astonishment
that so many hundreds of miles of coast line frequented by our shipping remain
unsurveyed ; and that even, in some cases, when the surveys have been executed
and charts published by foreign governments, they are not accessible in an English

form. In the interests of humanity and of the well-being of our trade, the

efforts of geographers in urging the completion of marine surveys ought to

be cordially seconded by Chambers of Commerce, and by all those whose material

interests are concerned in the provision of accurate charts of all coasts visited by

our shipping.

Hitherto I have invited your attention to the basis of geography, to the

measurement of the surface of land and sea, and of their heights and depths ; to
the mapping of the world, and to the innumerable uses of maps and charts. But

this only forms the skeleton of our science, which is endued with flesh and blood,

with life and motion, by those who study the causes and nature of the changes

that have taken place and are  now  taking  place  upon  the  earth                             by comparative
                                                                                             ;

and physical geographers, by those who study and classify natural phenomena,

and demonstrate their connection with each other and tbeir places in the great

scheme of nature.
     Geography and geology are, from one point of view, sister sciences. The

former treats of the earth as it now is and of changes which have occurred within

historical times. The latter deals with the condition of the earth and the changes
on its surface which went on during the cycles of ages before the dawn of history.

The two sciences are quite distinct, while they aid each other. No geological

survey can be undertaken without the previous completion of geographical maps, and

the geologist is enabled to comprehend the condition of the earth in remote ages

by studying the phenomena of physical geography. On the other hand, the

geographer acquires a correct understanding of the present state of the earth's
surface by considering the records of those marvellous changes which can be

gathered from history and from the narratives of travellers and observers in all

ages. Without their services, geography would lose half its interest.
     Comparative geography (the study of the changes which have taken place on

the earth's surface within historical times) is, therefore, a most important branch of

our science ; and it enlists the historian and the topographer in our service. It is
a branch of geography which has not hitherto received the amount of attention

it deserves.

     The importance of the study of history and of early narratives for the elucida-
tion of points in physical geography will appear from the consideration of a few
instances. Take for example the great and fertile basin of the river Ganges in

India. The Sanscrit historian finds reason for the belief that in 3000 B.C. the only
habitable part of the alluvial plain of India was the water-parting or ridge between
the Sutlej and the Jumna. The rest was a great estuary or arm of the sea. It
has only been fit for man's occupation within the historical period, and hundreds of
square miles of the delta have become habitable since the days of Lord Olive.
The wonderful history of these changes can be traced by the student, who thus

enables the geographer to explain the phenomena which he observes. Mr. Blan-

ford, in his charming work on physical geography for the use of Indian schools,

supposes a native of the country to be standing on the bank of the river
that flows by his village, watching the turbid flood swirling past. The chur
opposite, which the river left dry when its waters fell at the close of the last rainy

season, and which, till lately, was covered by a rich green crop of indigo, is now
more than half cut away, and buried beneath the water. Masses, many times

larger than the house he lives in, from time to time detach themselves, and are

swallowed up by the deep muddy stream. If the Hindu ponders over what he sees
he will perhaps be led to make inquiries, and old people will probably tell him that
half a century ago the river itself was a moderate sized khall, and that the old
channel, seven or eight miles oft", now little more than a string of pools, was at
that time a great river. These facts and their causes will open to him an in-
teresting chapter in physical geography ; which is made more complete and more
                                                                                  ;

interesting by the ancient records of his people. But geography is an applied

science. This body of facts and their causes is not a subject for mere speculative

study only. It is of practical utility ; for the knowledge of the way in which

Nature has worked in past ages discloses her present and future operations,

and enables the enlightened administrator and engineer to work in harmony

with them.

Again, to pass to another part of the world. The student of history reads of

the great sea fight which King Edward III. fought with the French off Sluys

how, in those days, the merchant vessels came up to the walls of that flourishing
seaport by every tide ; and how a century later a Portuguese fleet conveyed Isabella
from Lisbon, and an English fleet brought Margaret of York from the Thames, to
marry successive Dukes of Burgundy at the port of Sluys. In our own time if a

modern traveller drives twelve miles out of Bruges across the Dutch frontier he

will find a small agricultural town surrounded by corn fields and meadows, and

clumps of trees, whence the sea is not in sight from the top of the town-hall steeple.

AThis is Sluys.  physical geographer will seek out the causes which have brought

about this surprising change. They are most interesting, and most conducive to

an intelligent comprehension of his science, and he will find them recorded in

history. Thus the historian and the geographer work hand in hand, each aiding

and furthering the researches of the other.

WeOnce more.     turn to the great Baie du Mont Saint Michel, between

Normandy and Brittany. In Roman authors we read of the vast forest called

' Setiacum nemus,' in the centre of which an isolated rock arose, surmounted by a

temple of Jupiter, once a college of Druidesses. Now the same rock, with its

glorious pile dedicated to St. Michael, is surrounded by the sea at high tides. The

story of this transformation is even more striking than that of Sluys ; and its

adequate narration justly earned for M. Manet the gold medal of the French

Geographical Society in 1828.

Once again let us turn for a moment to the Mediterranean shores of Spain, and

the mountains of Murcia. Those rocky heights, whose peaks stand out against

the deep blue sky, hardly support a blade of vegetation. The algarobas and olives

at their bases are artificially supplied with soil. It is scarcely credible that these

are the same mountains which, according to the forest book of King Alfonso el

Sabio, were once clothed to their summits with pines and other forest trees ; while

soft clouds and mist hung over a rounded shaggy outline of wood, where now

the naked rocks make a hard line against the burnished sky. But Arab and Spanish

chroniclers alike record the facts, and geographical science explains the cause.

There is scarcely a district in the whole range of the civilised world where

some equally interesting geographical story has not been recorded, and where the

same valuable lessons may not be taught. This is comparative geography.
     The peasant of Bengal sees the mould falling into his turbid river, and learns

the first lesson of a course which teaches him the history of the formation of the

mighty basin of the Ganges. So should we, in England, to use the words of

Professor Huxley, ' seek the meanings of the phenomena offered by the brook which

runs through our village, or of the gravel pit whence our roads are mended.'
Their meaning is equally significant, equally instructive, and it is thus that we

should all begin to learn geography.

Here, in this valley of the Don, as elsewhere throughout England and the wide

world, the lessons of geography are open for you to learn. I intend, with the

permission of the Section, to conclude this address by referring to the physical

geography of the basin of the river Don, not presuming to teach the natives those

natural features which they must needs know far better than I, but endeavouring

to point out how each feature has its lesson to teach, which bears on questions
relating to distant lands, and how a man may become a sound practical geographer
without going more than twenty miles from his own door. In this way I would

urge all my countrymen whose destiny is not to travel far afield, by studying the

geography of their own native district, to acquire a comprehensive grounding which

will fit them to discuss more general geographical questions relating to broader

problems and more distant regions.

                                        THE VALLEY OP THE DON.

     In discussing the geography of the valley of the Don, the river basin in which

Sheffield is situated, I am anxious again to assure the local members of this Section

Mythat I do not presume to give lessons to them respecting their own country.

objects are rather to point out the ready means of acquiring geographical knowledge

at their own doors, and to explain the connection between geography and other
sciences, especially geology, by making use of the illustrations furnished by a

special region.

     I shall endeavour to show you, although geography requires the aid of other

--sciences of geology in explaining the physical phenomena on the earth's surface

of ethnology, in treating of the effects of climate and other physical conditions on

the races of men ; of botany and zoology in studying the distribution of plants
and animals; of meteorology ; and of history in telling us of the changes that have

--been progressing in former ages that nevertheless our science forms a distinct

body of knowledge, with its own objects, and its own methods of research.
     The river basin of the Don, the region of which Sheffield is the capital,

occupies an area of 600 square miles, and is about 40 miles in length by 15 to 20
miles wide. It extends from the central water-parting of England eastward to the

tidal waters of the Ouse; and from the sea level to the highest peaks on the

water-parting there is a rise of nearly 2,000 feet. At the first glance over this
region we see at once how diversified are the physical features it presents, from
craggy heights round the sources of the Don to the levels of Hatfield Chase and
Tborne Waste. This diversity assists an inhabitant to study, round his own home,
many of the geographical problems which he reads or hears of in connection with

distant regions, where nature has worked on a grander or more extended scale.

Instead of confining himself to the study of books, he may go to the book of nature

which is open before him, and to which he will return with ever-increasing delight
and interest. For almost every geographical point that he meets with in the
course of study will be found illustrated in the physical features of his native
river-basin ; and if the chances of life lead to his becoming a traveller in distant

lands, he can have had no better training than a study of the valley of the Don

affords.

   A range of mountains containing the sources of the Don extends for some

twenty miles, and forms the western rim of the river basin. To the north is
Ramsden Clough, where the Don and Calder take their rise, and near here the Holme
Moss attains a height of 1,860 feet. The country ia diversified by high hills of
                       --

moorland and deep valleys, through which the Don makes its way until it reaches
Penistone, when it takes a sharp turn to the south, and flows along the eastern
skirts of the hills, receiving several tributaries. First, the Little Don rises on
Langsett and Harden Moors, and falls into the parent stream at Deep Car. Next
comes the Ewden Beck flowing down a moorland dell, and joining the Don
opposite to the woods of Wliarncliffe. The Locksley rises in a desolate and

--mountainous waste on the borders of Derbyshire, and is at first a torrent the

Dale Dyke, dashing over a rocky bed amidst beautiful and romantic scenery, so

well described by Mr. Davis : ' Lower down there are scattered hamlets, sylvan
nooks of rare loveliness, villages nestled under the shelter of the hills, shaded by
overhanging woods. At the village of Locksley the scenery becomes very beautiful.
The river runs through a narrow gorge, with precipitous crags on either side, and,

at Malin Bridge it opens on a plain where the Locksley and Rivelin unite, and falls
into the Don.' Lastly, the Sheaf and Porter brooks, flowing through vales
which were once very beautiful, unite in this town of Sheffield, and also send their
waters to swell the Don. Ebenezer Elliott, the poet of this district, had the true
spirit of a geographer when, with a light but accurate touch, he swiftly strikes
note after note of his homely lyre, at each touch calling up a clear memory in the
mind of his fellow-townsmen :

                     Say, shall we wander where, through warriors' graves,
                       The infant Yew den, mountain cradled, trills
                      Her Doric notes ? Or where the Locksley raves
                        Of broil and battle, and the rocks and caves
                      Dream yet of ancient days ? Or where the sky

                        Darkens o'er Rivelin, the clear and cold,
                         That throws his blue length, like a snake, from high ?
                        Or where deep azure brightens into gold,
                      O'er Sheaf, that mourns in Eden ? Or where, roll'd

                     On tawny sands, through regions passion wild
                     And groves of love, in jealous beauty dark,

                         Complains the Porter, Nature's thwarted child,
                        Born in the waste, like headlong Wyming.

      These tributaries drain the wild moorlands, while the river which receives
them flows from north to south, from Penistone to Sheffield, down a deep glen
along the foot of the western hills, and confined on the east by the steep forest-
clad escarpment of Wharnclifie, with a background of higher fells.

     At Sheffield the Don entirely alters its course, turning to the north-east, and

flowing through a country diversified by high hills and deep valleys, but still far
less rugged and lofty than the western hills, which are drained by the torrent-like

affluents. Here the Don receives the Rother from the south ; and some miles fur-
ther on, the Deame, with a course entirely within this lower and less rugged

country, enters from the northern side.
      Readers of ' Ivanhoe ' will remember that this is ' the pleasant district of merry

England, watered by the river Don, where extended in ancient times a large forest,
covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between Sheffield

and the pleasant town of Doncaster.' At Locksley, in the mountain glen above

Sheffield, was the birthplace of bold Robin Hood, all this region was the sceno of
his exploits, and away to the east, in the same river-basin of the Don, is Robin
 Hood's well, and Barnesdale--scene of the encounter described in the ballad of

' Guy of Gisborne.' As the Don, in this part of its course, approaches the old
castle of Conisborough, it enters upon a fertile stretch of meadow land. Sir Wal-

ter Scott, in ' Ivanhoe,' says that ' there are few more beautiful or striking scenes
 in England than are presented by the vicinity of this ancient fortress ; where the
soft and gentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre in which cultivation is
 richly blended with woodland.'

      After leaving Conisborough a change takes place in the scenery. There is a
 plateau, some four or five miles in width, and extending north and south across
 the river-basin, terminating on the west with a clearly defined escarpment.
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                          427

Through this plateau hoth the Don and its tributary the Went, flowing in a

parallel course to the north, have to force their way. The rivers flow through nar-

row valleys of fertile pasture bordered by undulating wooded banks, and the

western escarpment, in the Went valley, is bold and picturesque. Leaving this

region at Hexthorpe, the Don enters a level plain which, beyond Doncaster, is in

places overlaid with peat, and there are wide stretches of marsh-lands called carrs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

a vast level extending to the Humber.

Such are the general features of the Don river-basin, which would strike the

least observant traveller. But the physical geographer investigates and explains

the occurrence of these features. He inquires why the western hills are the

loftiest and most craggy ; why the Don changes its course and flows in a deep
trough along their skirts ; why the adjoining country, though still hilly, is softer
in outline. He examines into the reason of the existence of a belt of plateau land

through which the Don and Went have to pass in scarped ravines ; and into the

causes which have led to the formation of the vast levels extending from Don-

caster to the Humber. In these researches, our science receives aid from geology,

which tells us the nature of the various rocks and the influence they have on the vary-

Weing features of the earth's surface as we now see it.  do not concern ourselves with

the way in which the rocks were originally formed, with lists of fossils with long

Latinized names, or with the condition of the earth's surface in the remote ages when

Wethose fossils were living creatures.  are only interested to know the nature

and texture of the rocks as they now exist, the order of their deposition, and

their economic uses. This information teaches us the causes which have produced

the varied configuration of the surface as we now see it.

Geology tells us the story of the formation of the Penine range of mountains

where the Don and its tributaries have their sources. The disturbances which the

beds of rock have undergone have had the effect of crumpling them up into a

number of troughs and arches. As each arch was raised up, the denudation took

slice after slice off its crest, so that along the saddle of each anticlinal line the

lower beds were laid bare, and now appear on the surface. The Pennine anti-

clinal, of which the hills containing the sources of the Don form a part, is a broad

arch extending north and south from Scotland to Derbyshire. Along the central

line of this arch, in the part whence flow the Don sources, the hard massive sand-

stones of the millstone-grit come out and, on account of their hardness, stand up

in a chain of rugged and lofty hills and moorland plateaux. It is the hardness of

the rock in the millstone-grit formation which produces the strongly featured

country of this part of the Penine range, and, by offering greater resistance to

denudation, maintains the superior height of these hills over all the country on

both sides.

Where the Don makes its great southerly bend from Penistone to Sheffield the

surface formation has changed, its course is then over the lower coal measures and

skirting the edge of the millstone-grit. In this fact, no doubt, is to be found the

reason of the direction taken by the river. The country where the lower coal

measures form the surface shows a repetition of the features of the millstone-

grit region, but somewhat less marked, and with less elevation.

On leaving Sheffield, the Don changes its course and enters the country of the

middle coal measures, where the bold features which characterise the lower coal

measures and the millstone-grit are missing. Here again there are indications of

the causes which decided the direction of the river bed. There are two faults

ranging in a north-east direction from Sheffield, along either side of the valley of

the Don, towards Oonisborough, and between these faults the rocks are much con-

torted. The southerly Don fault passes S.W. to N.E. through Sheffield, along the

south-east margin of the Don valley to near Aldwark, and runs on by Thrybergh

and Hooton Roberts to Cadeby. The thick beds of sandstone which alternate

with the coal in this formation often form bold escarpments, such as the ridge

which adds so much to the beauty of Wentworth Park.

   We can next account for the picturesque ravines through which the Don and

Went find their way before reaching the levels. For here is the more recent

Permian formation of magnesian limestone which extends in a narrow belt, four or
428 report-- 1879.

five miles in width, right across Yorkshire from the North Riding to Nottingham-

shire. Wherever the rivers force their way across this limestone, we find picturesque
scenery. Outside the Don valley we have Jackdaw Crags, near Thorparch, rising

over the river Wharfe and Anston Rocks to the south, within the Trent drainage

system. On the south-east bank of the Don also there is a bold escarpment ; and
the Went is, on either hand, bounded by precipices of limestone, where it cuts its
way through the Permian formation.

     Eastward of the magnesian limestone, which forms a distinct escarpment across

the river-basin from north to south, is the Trias formation, consisting of the deep
red Bunter Sandstone on which the town of Doncaster is built. But the Trias

only occurs in patches, and is generally overlaid by the muddy deposits from the
Humber, on which are the wide expanses of level peat moss, ranging from 1 to

20 feet in thickness. In cutting through this peat, cones of Scotch firs have
been plentifully found, and in the lower layers there are stumps of trees firmly

rooted into the sand, proving that a forest once grew there.

It will have been seen how the geology of the Don basin helps us to understand

its physical features. The different formations decide the position of the water-

Aparting, the direction of the drainage, and even the character of the scenery.'

knowledge is often desirable, not only of the surface rock, but also of the formation

which underlies it. When, for example, the magnesian limestone rests on a hard

sandstone, its escarpment often rises to more importance than when its foundations

are on a softer rock.

The distribution of plants, which is another and a very interesting branch of

inquiry in the study of physical geography, is decided chiefly by climate and alti-

tude above the sea, but it also depends a good deal upon the soils and the forma-

tions from which they come, and here again geology is useful to the geographer.

On the millstone-grit mountains we find high Alpine plants, but not in such

abundance as in other parts of the Penine range to the north, when it reaches a

higher altitude, and where  the mountain  limestone comes     to the  surface                              and we
                                                                                                        ;

are told that the characteristic of this formation is many individuals but few

species. _ The ivy-leaved campanula is found by the moorland rills, pennywort

grows wild at Bradfield, and the hills contain a rare fern (Asplenium lanceolatum)

discovered by Dr. Gatty, the locality of which is wisely kept a secret from ruthless
collectors. But the oak is the prevalent and self-sown tree on this gritstone soil,
and is_ indigenous in the beautiful woods of Wharncliffe. Elliot sings of the

' Rivelin Oak,' and Evelyn, in his ' Sylva,' records the gig-antic size of some of the

trees in Sheffield Park.

     In the valley of the Dearne, and generally over the coal measures, theflora is
not rich. The alternations of shales and clay hold the rainfall above them, instead
of allowing it to filter quickly away, and cause a wet and stifl' soil. In the

Permian formation, on the other hand, there are many uncommon limestone-

Aloving plants, and the levels beyond Doncaster abound in marsh plants.

         cursory study of the floras in these several formations, guided by the labours

of botanists, will enable the geographer to appreciate the causes which influence
the distribution of plants, and the various effects of soils, altitude above the sea,
moisture and temperature. In extending his view, he would compare the flora of

the Don river-basin with those of neighbouring basins, and thus obtain a know-

ledge of the_ comparative flora of a wider region, and of the influences which regu-

late its distribution. There cannot be any better training for the study of botanical
geography on a broader and more general scale.

     Meteorology is also an important element in the study of physical geography,
not only as determining climate, and its · influence on plant distribution, but as

affecting the hydrography of a region, and the amount and rapidity of denudation.

Its study should not be confined to mere registration, the barren results of which
have too often been demonstrated. It is very seldom that reliable observations

range over a sufficiently long time to give useful results even in countries where

there is a trigonometrical survey (the height of civilisation), and scarcely ever in

less advanced districts. In Mr. Harrison's interesting history of the flood of 1864,
I notice a record of the rainfall in the Dale Dyke valley, varying from 46 inches
                                                                     ;

                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                  429

in 1859 to 38 in 1861; and at Barnsley, within the Don valley, there was an

extraordinary difference between the annual rainfalls of two succeeding years,
namely, 42 inches in 1872, and 16 in 1873. The latter example shows the
necessity for a series of observations extending over many years. The geographer,

in his meteorological researches, should not of course neglect registration. On the

contrary, he should be habitually exact on this point ; but he should be careful, at
the same time, to collect all kinds of information respecting normal and abnormal

seasons, and all other particulars which might serve both to supplement and to

check his observations.

In all these branches of the subject the comparative elements should be kept
Wein view.
            must look back as far as the records of history will allow us, to

learn the causes of the present state of the surface of our district, from its past

condition at various historical epochs. It is here that the historian and the topo-
grapher come to our aid. Time is a powerful and active agent in these changes

but the most interesting and instructive side of the subject is the examination of

the effects of human agency in the changes on the earth's surface.

    From this point of view the histoiy of a mountain range frequently offers a

most valuable subject for study. Mountains usually supply within themselves a
natural regulator which checks the rapid flow of the rain water in surface drainage.

The absence of such a regulator causes disastrous floods. The regulator acts as a
sponge, and is supplied either in the form of a large area of forest, of swamps or
peat bogs, of a system of lakes, or of artificial reservoirs. Where there are no
forests, nature usually supplies their place with swampy moors.

The surface of the wild moors where the springs of the Don and its tributaries

take their rise is covered with heath and ferns, and in winter, after heavy rains,

Athe ground is spongy, and persons have been lost and buried in it.  knowledge

of these moors explains the route taken by William the Conqueror in February

1070, in his winter march from York to Chester. The horses of the knights were

swallowed up by the treacherous swamps, and swept away by the torrents;

and the record of Ordericus Vitalis gives a vivid picture of a march across the

Penine chain in mid-winter 800 years ago. In this condition it long remained,

and even now the unchanging hills are little altered. But at the same time that

cultivation encroached on the moorland sponge, the necessities of great centres of

population have called for the construction of large artificial reservoirs, which also

serve the purpose of regulating the flow of surface drainage.

     There is the artificial lake of Dunford bridge near the main source of the Don.
The reservoir at Barker Pool, in use since 1434, appears to have been the first

artificial attempt to store water for use in Sheffield, and afterwards a chain of
dams in the valley on Crooks Moor met the demand. In 1864 the Dale Dyke or
Bradfield Reservoir was completed, covering an area of 78 acres ; and on the
11th of March it burst through the dam, making a breach 100 yards long and 70

deep. This appalling catastrophe, so admirably described by Mr. Harrison, shows

the irresistible power of floods in motion which, in other countries, are the work

of nature unaided by the labours of man. The cataclysms of the Indus, for
example, in 1841, and of the Sutlej, in 1819, were caused, not by faulty con-

struction of an engineer's dam, but by the rending away of the shoulder of a
mountain which had fallen into the river-beds. But the effects were similar.

The lesson of the desolating flood of 1864 was profited by in Sheffield, and the

work of storing water proceeded. In 1869 the Agden Dam was completed. The
Strines Reservoir was finished in 1872, the Dale Dyke in 1874, and the Dam

Flask in 1875, the united area forming, I understand, 300 acres of water.
    The necessity for the storage of water, owing to the destruction of forests, and

for irrigation purposes, is often a subject of discussion with reference to other

mountain ranges, and to disastrous floods in other countries ; and the native of

Sheffield may acquire a practical knowledge of many sides of an important problem

by an observant exploration of the hills and moorlands within a few miles of his

own home.

The effects of human agency on the aspects of nature are also very strikingly

displayed in the country between Sheffield and Doncaster, and northwards towards

NowBarnsley and Pontefract.  this region is alive with busy collieries, iron works
--and quarry workings is covered with cultivation and intersected by canals and

railways. Within historical times it was a vast forest, with patches of cultivation
at long intervals, and dominated by the mighty barons, the Furnivals and Warrens,

in the feudal castles of Sheffield and Conisborough. There are still patches of the

primaeval forests, or at least tracts which have never been under cultivation. The parks

of Wentworth and Wortley and Thrybergh have probably never known the plough,

and in the smaller area of Aldwark there have been Clarels, Fitzwilliams, and

Foljambes for at least six centuries. One would expect to find plants, the survivors

of an old forest or marsh flora, in these patches, which are unknown or uncommon
Weelsewhere ; and this appears to be the case.
                                                    are told, for instance, that at

Aldwark the rare Stdlaria glauca grows, and that the Carex elongata has been

found there, though not recently. It is probable that many points of geographical
interest would be deduced by an intelligent observer who makes a careful comparison

of the descriptions of the country in past times with its actual condition.

But the most remarkable effects of man's agency are to be observed in the levels

upon which the Don enters after leaving the town of Doncaster.

The vast expanse of levels comprised in Hatfield Chase, Thorne Waste, and

Goole Moors covers several square miles. Hatfield Chase alone has an area of

70,000 acres, and was a wild country consisting of forest and moor, intersected by

watercourses and dotted with large pools and swamps. The waters of the Don
spread over this expanse, the overflow finding its way to the Trent at Adlingfleet.

The Idle, now part of the Trent system, also emptied its waters into the great

levels. There were large meres or lakes yielding much fish and frequented by all

kinds of water-fowl, and boats were the means of communication between Thorne

and Hatfield. There were a few islands rising above the level, such as Lindholme,

in Hatfield Turf Moor, which could only be reached in seasons of extreme drought.

The Earls Warren of Conisborough Castle had a timber-house at Hatfield, whither

they went to hunt the deer in a well-stocked park. Here the second son of

Edward HI., named William of Hatfield, was born, and Henry, the eldest son

of Richard Duke of York, in 1441. William of Worcester also mentions another

event relating to the Duke of York and the Duchess Cicely as happening at Hatfield,

which I need not further particularise. The births of these Plantagenets at

Hatfield are only interesting to the geographer because they indicate the nature of

the surrounding country, which would afford attractions to that sport-loving race :

a wild district abounding in game.

One of these royal hunts took place in 1609, when Henry, Prince of Wales,

embarked at Tudworth, accompanied by a hundred boats. Deer, to the number of

five hundred, were frighted out of the woods and closes, and all took to the water,

being driven into Thorne Mere, where the fattest were killed.

This was  the last  royal  hunt  in  the  Hatfield  swamps                                   for in  1626 the famous
                                                                                          ;

undertaking was inaugurated which has effected so marvellous a change in this

part of the Don basin. In that year Cornelius Vermuyden, of Tholen in Zealand,

with the aid of Dutch capital and Dutch labour, undertook to drain the levels.

The south channel of the Don, by which it discharged its waters into the Trent,

was to be stopped, and all the waters were forced into the north channel to flow

into the Aire. The river Idle, which spread its waters over the level, was to be

stopped also, and earned by a new channel into the Trent ; and deep drains were

to be cut to the Trent from the great ponds and swamps round Thorne and Hatfield.

The Dutch labourers, who understood the work thoroughly, made rapid progress

but there was one great mistake in the original design. It was soon found that

the north channel could not carry off all the Don water to the Aire, and there was
great loss from floodings of the adjacent lands. It then became necessary to make
the existing straight cut from the Don to the Ouse at Goole, which is known as the

Dutch river, and this added so largely to the cost that it prevented the undertaking

from being commercially successful to the first adventurers. Many Dutch famflies,

however, settled on the reclaimed lands ; and one of their descendants, Abraham

de la Pryrne, wrote a history of the undertaking.

The change has been wonderful, and it now seems almost incredible that boats

·were once the means of communication between Thome and Hatfield. The

fertility of the banks of the Ouse has also been marvellously increased by the
system of warping which was introduced early in the last century. Mr. Ralph

Greyke, of Rawcliffe, warped 429 acres, and received the gold medal of the

Society of Arts in 1825 for his interesting paper on the subject. Warp is a fine

light-brown sediment held in suspension in the river. It is soft and silky to the

touch and contains numerous glistening scales of mica. The land to be warped is
surrounded by a substantial bank. The water is then admitted, and kept there by

closing the flood-gates until the second return of the tide, when it is allowed to
flow off. The same process is repeated at the next tide, mud being deposited.
Thus either a new soil is created or a thin and poor soil improved, there being 12
to 16 inches deposited in one season, and even more. Indeed, as many as 10 to 15
acres have been known to be covered with 2 to 3 feet of warp during one spring

of ten to twelve tides. An expert warp-farmer can, by careful attention to the

currents, even temper his soil as he pleases. For the heaviest particles are first

deposited, which are those of sand. Then a mixture of sand and fine mud, the

most valuable soil. Lastly the pure mud subsides, which is rich but tenacious.

The great point is to get the second and mixed deposit over the whole surface, and

this is done by keeping the water in constant motion, for the last deposit only takes

place in still water. Mr. Caird mentions that fifty years ago Armyn pastures, near

Goole, were mostly under water, a breeding-place for wild ducks, and the rest

Nowyielded a few cranberries.          400 acres are under crops.

We thus see the important influence that human agency has had in determining

the character of the earth's surface, and of what consequence a study of the

history of that agency must always be to the comparative geographer. Away in

the western hills large artificial lakes have altered the face of the wild moorlands.

In the region between Sheffield and Doncaster the forest haunts of Robin Hood

have disappeared before the collieries and ironworks, the cultivators and quarriers

of modern times. In the levels high cultivation and warp-farms occupy the sites
of wide lakes and swamps and dreary wastes, while the courses of the rivers have

been altered. Kindred changes have taken place or are in progress in other parts

of the world, often upon a much larger scale ; so that a study of the efl'ects of
human agency in the valley of the Don is an admirable training for a more

extended examination of the facts of comparative geography.

Our science also occupies itself with the economic statistics of the earth, with

the circulation of trade and the products of various regions. Geographers note,
for example, the uses of rocks and soils, and the mineral resources of a district. In

the millstone-grit range of hills it belongs to geography to record that the lowest

grit or kinderscout furnishes blocks for engine beds, for foundations, and reservoir

works, but that there are difficulties in making use of it owing to the wild and

Weinaccessible character of a great part of the country in which it is found.

should also note the positions and yield of the collieries, the statistics of the iron

trade, the agricultural statistics, and the commercial routes, as well as the distribu-

tion of population. Many of these vital interests of the region are capable of

cartographic illustration.

    This region round Sheffield is fortunate in its writers, who have made the road
easy for future students. Your very poets, Ebenezer Elliott and James Mont-
gomery, were endowed by nature with geographical instincts. Few districts have

had such topographers as Hunter and Eastwood, Holland and Gatty, or so able an
antiquary as Mr. Stacye. The authors of the ' Geology of the Yorkshire Coal Field'

have furnished you with a detailed history of your rocks ; and in their admirable

work on the physical geography and botanical topography of West Yorkshire, Mr.

James W. Davis and Dr. Lees have rendered you an inestimable service. From

their work I have derived many of the ideas and a great deal of the information

which have been submitted to you in this paper ; and I must pay my tribute of

admiration to the excellence of their design, and to the ability and learning1 that

they have brought to bear on its execution. It is much to be desired that their

example should be copied by other workers, and that books on the same plan

should be prepared for the rest of England. But a combination of equal energy,

learning, and literary skill is not easily to be found.

    I have now endeavoured, to the best of my ability, by using illustrations from

the river-basin in which this town is situated, to bring to the notice of the Section
Mya complete view of the objects and methods of the science of geography.
                                                                           aim

has been to show that geographical researches may be made within the range of a

few miles of your own homes, and that there can be no better training for a

geographer than the study of the various branches of inquiry which are comprised

in our science, within his own river-basin. If I should succeed in arousing an interest

in the subject, in the minds of only a few of the natives of Hallamshire, my object

will be attained ; for it is by the formation of such small centres of workers that a

whole mass is leavened, and it is thus that steady advances in the varied pursuits

and objects which are included in human progress are secured.

                    1. The Trade Routes from Bengal to Tibet.

By Lieut.-Col. T. H. Lewin, late Deputy Commissioner of Barjiling.

In the absence of statistics of the actual trade which the author had not had

time to obtain from India, a general view only could be given of the nature and

extent of the present exports and imports between India and Tibet. The chief

wealth of Tibet lies in her flocks and herds ; and were the passes open and the

roads improved, large quantities of cows, sheep and goats, wool, cheese, and butter

would find their way to our territory. At present the export of live stock is

limited to the carrying capacity of the animals themselves. The Tibetan traders

drive in before them sufficient sheep, goats, or yak to supply them with food on

the road, and to carry the goods and merchandise which theybring with them.

No trade in live stock is carried on, save that a few ponies come in  for sale and of
                                                                                                         ;

late years even these have decreased in numbers and increased in price. Other

--articles brought to India by Tibetan traders, are coarse woollen blankets and

carpets, sheep's wool (to northern and central Himalayan districts), yaks' tails,

musk, borax, and rhubarb. The country abounds in minerals, which are not

worked, except gold in a rude fashion. The gold-fields extend along the base of

the southern watershed of the Brahmaputra, and the gold-diggers come chiefly

from the country round Shigatze. But the most important of all the exports from

Tibet is brick-tea, obtained from Sze-chuen, from a coarse-tasted leaf, which the

inhabitants, however, prefer to the finer teas grown in our own plantations of

Assam and the Himalayan valleys. Tea is one of the principal sources of revenue

to the Lhasa Government, and the trade is guarded with jealousy from foreign com-

petition. The imports into Tibet are far more important at present than the exports :

chief among them are English broadcloths and woollens.  The great lack of fuel
                                                                           _

and the cold dry air of these high mountains render warm clothing an absolute ne-

cessity of life, thus the cold-weather clothing of a Tibetan is almost like a vast

moving bed, and our English broadcloths are highly prized. The Tibetans are

somewhat superstitious as to the colours to be worn. They will not wear blue or

black, and only persons of rank wear velvet ; their favourite colours are_ scarlet,

purple, a liver-brown, and a snuff-coloured yellow. Turkey-red cloths, prints and

flowered calicoes are in good demand. Imitations of Indian handkerchiefs and

Cashmere shawls are very popular among the lower classes ; chintzes do not seem

to be worn. Cottons are not used, save for linings, and also as coverings for sacred
Ompictures. Cheap silk handkerchiefs, especially if the sacred sentence
                                                                         mani

paduni houm were woven into the fabric. There is a good demand for indigo and

opium. Quicksilver, vermilion, and red and white lead are also imported in con-
                                                                                    ;

siderable quantities, for gilding the roofs of religious houses. Wall shades, chande-

liers, tumblers, wine-glasses, small mirrors, and lanterns find a ready sale. Eno-lish

cutlery, knives and scissors are much prized, and if our manufacturers would con-
descend to work upon native models a much larger sale would be commanded.

After passing in review the various trade-routes from India to Tibet, via Assam,

Bhutan, Darjiling, and Nepaul, and giving a brief historical sketch of our commer-

cial and political relations with Tibet, Nepaul, and Bhutan, the author summed up

by saying that he thought the arguments in favour of a trade route from Darjiling

to China vid Tibet were very strong. Lhasa is less than a month's journey for an

unladen man from our frontier ; once there, the old established trade-routes between

Tibet and China are open to us, leading by well-known roads to the great river-

basins of the Hoang Ho and the Yang-Tsze. The great province of Sze-chuen,

with its 30 millions of inhabitants, would be opened up, and its silk, tea, rhubarb,

musk, jade, amber, and cinnabar obtainable in exchange for British manufactures.

The inhabitants of Tibet are a peaceful, well-educated and commercially well-dis-

Aposed race. The routes through Burmah have been tried and have failed.

better route to China may perhaps be found through Assam, but only when railway

communication shall be extended up the valley of the Brahmaputra. In future

this will be the best road, but for the next 50 years the central route vid Darjiling

will no doubt be the best. The Tibetans are Buddhists, and the creed of Buddhism

is based on the equality and brotherhood of mankind. It will not be religious

intolerance which bars the way to Lhasa ; the real obstacles to be contended with

are and will be commercial interests. It is the interest of the Lamas or governing

classes to exclude us, for, at present, they hold a practical monopoly of the trade,

and profit largely both from the duties on important goods, and by the sale of

permits to the traders ; and it is also the interest of the traders to keep us out

for competition would be ruinous to their present high rate of profits. The real

cause of Chinese opposition to us in Tibet lies in their fear that we shall oust

them from their commercial and political pre-eminencs in the country. In conclu-

sion, the author urged the necessity of our insisting on the carrying out of the

Aprivileges with regard to Tibet granted to us by the Chefoo Convention.  clause

in this treaty sanctions our intercourse with the country, and authorises our send-

ing a mission thither. This mission should be sent, and we should direct our efforts

to establishing permanent trading agents or consuls at Shigatze and Lhasa, or trad-

ing-posts on the frontier at Chumbi and Phakri, similar to that possessed by the

Russians at Kiachta.

2. The Upper Course of the Brahmaputra River. By C. E. D. Black.

    The river Sanpu forms a unique and important feature in the geography of

UTibet, for the two provinces of and Tsang occupy its basin from the Mariam-la

pass eastward. Until last year the lower course of the Sanpu was a matter of

complete uncertainty. Klaproth had contended that its waters discharged them-

selves into the Irrawaddy (a theory which had been recently revived and ably

argued by a geographer in India), while two years ago Colonel Godwin-Austen

suggested that the Subansiri might be the lower course of the Sanpu. Although

the question cannot be looked upon as settled beyond all possibility of doubt, a

recent exploration of its lower course has left very little room for theory in the

matter.

The Sanpu rises in "Western Tibet in 82° E. longitude and 30° 35' N. latitude

at a height of upwards of 15,000 feet above sea-level. It thence flows eastward

over a series of elevated undulating plains, where are found sheep, goats, and yaks.

On the south lie gigantic glaciers, clothing the slopes of the central Himalaya.
From thence its course lies pretty uniformly eastward, while it is joined both on the

right and left by some seven or eight tributaries of varying importance, those from

the south appearing to proceed from glaciers, while those from the north by the

clearness of their waters would seem to have a different origin. The principal

towns lying in the basin of the Sanpu are Jang-lache, Shigatze, and Lhasa. These

are connected with themselves and with Gartok in the extreme north-west by a
remarkable road 800 miles long, which follows in a general direction the course of

the main river to the junction of the Lhasa river. This road is dotted at intervals

by brick-built post-houses for travellers and for the special official messengers who
cover the entire distance in an average period of 23 days. The Sanpu is spanned
by a few bridges, but these are nearly all unsafe, and the usual method of crossing
is by clumsy ferry-boats, which are minutely described by Mr. Bogle, Warren

Hastings's envoy.

The furthest point to which the Sanpu had been traced was Chetang, a village

the position of which had been fixed by Pundit Nain Siugh. In 1877 a native

Nsurveyor,  g, was despatched by General J. T. Walker, Surveyor-General

of India, to follow and map out the course of the Sanpu eastward of this point,

and as far as possible. Crossing to the northern bank of the river, he followed it

eastwards for about 30 miles, and then had to diverge to the north-east and back

again towards the south-east for a distance of 50 miles, while the river itself

wended its way through impenetrable mountains for about 20 miles. Up to Gyatsa-

Jong, the point where he struck the Sanpu again, the river flows pretty much as

reported by Nain Singh, but beyond that point it proves to flow first due eastward

for about 50 miles and then north-east for about 80 miles. It reaches its most
northern point near the intersection of the meridian of 94° with the parallel of 30°

about 12 miles to the north-east of a place which the explorer calls Chamkar, and

which apparently may be identified with D'Anville's Tchamca. After attaining

its most northern point, the river turns due south-east, reaching Gya-la-Singdong

in 15 miles. From this point the explorer was unable to follow it. Thence, how-

ever, he saw that it flowed on for a great distance, passing through a considerable

opening in the mountain ranges, to the west of a high peak called Jung-la.

Beyond this opening the river was said to pass through a country inhabited by

savages into a land ruled by the British. The distance between Gya-la-Singdong

and the highest point hitherto fixed on the Dihong would thus be only about 100

miles. The height of Gya-la-Singdong was found to be 8000 feet, showing that

the river had fallen about 3500 feet in 200 miles, and leaving a descent of 7000

feet for the distance of 160 miles to its junction with other Himalayan rivers.

This exploration gives an interesting explanation of the large bulk of the

Subansiri, as within the large bend of the Sanpu room is left for a northern feeder

of that river. The recent measurement of the discharges of the Assam rivers

by Lieutenant Harman 1 also testify to the probability of the Dihong being the only

possible lower course of the Sanpu.

Corroborative information of this theory is also supplied by the Abbe' Desgodins's

researches as communicated to the French Geographical Society, as he had been

informed that some days' journey east of Lhasa the river turns southward with a

long bend and traversing the Hia-yul district flows into the Lhopa country under

the name Dehon.

The combined information thus afforded appears to argue irresistibly in favour

of the identity of the Sanpu and Dihong.

                       3. The Dutch Expedition to Central Sumatra.

   By Professor P. J. Yeth, President of the Dutch Geographical Society.

    Although we possess in Marsden's ' History of Sumatra ' the best and most ex-
haustive general work on that island, still it is antiquated, and the knowledge of
the country in his time was even less complete than it is now. The war in Achen

since 1873 has increased our acquaintance with the northern province, and in

Central and Southern Sumatra many explorers have recently been at work,
especially on the west coast. But an extensive area from the central mountain
range towards the east coast yet remains comparatively unknown, and has been
taken in hand by the Dutch Geographical Society, which determined to investigate
the Jambi district (about equivalent to the Congo in African exploration). The

Sultanate of Jambi, comprised in the river basin of tbe Batang-Hari, is coterminous

on the west with the Padang Highlands and Beucoolen, along the water-parting

of the island                                                  it is bounded  on  the  south by Palembang, on the  north by districts

dependent on the Sultan of Liugga, and on the east by the sea. It is watered by

a tine navigable river, the Batang-Hari, with several important tributaries, and

comprises districts rich in natural products and peopled by industrious inhabitants.

Sultan Taha, having been driven inland by the Dutch in 1858, and his uncle Ahmed

set up in his place, is naturally opposed to Europeans and averse to exploration.

The Dutch Geographical Society, however, sent out an expedition, divided into

two parties, one from the west to explore the sources of the Batang-Hari and its

affluents ; the other under Lieutenant Schoun Santvoort to go up the river in a

steam-launch from the east coast, with the intention of meeting the tirst party.

At the end of March 1877, Schoun Santvoort made an unaccompanied successful

preliminary journey from Padang, crossing the mountains and descending the river

to Jambi in a boat ; he then went to Batavia for the launch and returned to Jambi

on June 7, but died on November 23, before ascending the river, of the lower part
of which he had made an accurate survey. Lieutenant Cornelissen, who succeeded

him in command, after two attempts to ascend the river in which he was foiled by

native opposition, returned to Jambi, where he remained until last March, collecting

information.

The western party, under Mr. Van Hasselt, accompanied by a son of the author

of the paper, commenced with a survey of the southern division of the Padang

Highlands. Excursions were made for ascertaining the navigability of the affluents

of the Batang-Hari, collecting specimens, photographing, and ascending peaks,

including Mount Tailing and Mount Karinchi (11,820 ft., never before ascended).

The precise course and navigability of the main river was ascertained for a con-

siderable distance, and a considerable bend towards the north discovered ; this

is of great importance, as it brings the river nearer than was expected to the

valuable coalfields of the valley of the river Ombilin, for which an east coast out-

let is required in the direction of Singapore and Batavia. The name Ombilin is

given to the upper course of the Indragini, which falls into the sea north of the

Batang-Hari, but is not supposed to be so large or so navigable. In January 1878

the party returned to Padang, intending to start for the interior from Palembang

on the south. Accordingly, Van Hasselt and Veth went up the river Musa and its
affluent the Eawas by boat to Muara Rupit, whence they marched to Surulanguni,

the residence of the chief officer in Rawas, the northern district of Palembang.

Pending negotiations with Payung Putik, the only friendly chief, an endeavour to

penetrate the district of Batang Asei in Jambi was not successfid. The district of

Lebang was, however, visited, and the explorers advanced through it to Rejang,

returning to Surulangum in June 1878, through Sindang. Photographs and

ethnological and zoological collections were secured during this part of the journey.

The friendly chief having declared his readiness to admit the party, Van Hasselt

and Veth crossed the frontier and reached the Limim, a feeder of the Tambesi, the

main southern tributary of the Batang-Hari. They got as far as Temiang on the

Limun, which is about thirty miles distant from the farthest point reached by

Cornelissen in his ascent from the east coast, but were then compelled to retreat

by a muster in force, finally reaching Surulangum on July 9, all exploration from
Palembang being abandoned. Van Hasselt then joined Cornelissen at Jambi,

returning overland to Padang, and Veth crossed the entire Palembang Residency

on foot, reaching Jambi in September. Both have now returned to Holland, with
many valuable observations and collections. The most important result of this

expedition is the gain in knowledge of the great extent and capabilities of the

Batang-Hari, which is found to be about 210 miles in length in a straight line,
and over 490 miles following its windings, being in fact larger than the Musi or-

Palembang, hitherto considered the only large river in Sumatra. It is practicable

for small prahus, used in transport of merchandise, for 480 miles ; and the steam-
launch drawing 3 J- ft. coidd navigate it for 370 miles, both these distances far
exceeding the navigable portion of the Musi. Its tributaries are also navigable

for boats, and one of them at least for the launch. The population of its district
as a whole is scanty, yet there are numerous villages close to each other ; cattle

abound in the highlands, and coffee is largely cultivated in Karinchi. The im-
portance of the river as a highway for the eastern parts of the West Coast Govern-
ment and the inland districts of Jambi and Karinchi does not therefore merely
depend upon its fitness for transport of coal from the Omhilin valley.

4. Discovery of the Sources of the Chico in Southern Patagonia.

                          By Don Ramon Llsta.

After a summary of the chief physical characteristics of Patagonia and its

people, and a brief mention of the chief authorities referring to tbat country, this

paper described the explorations of Don Ramon Lista, who in 1878 was sent b)r

the Buenos Ayres Government and the Sociedad Cientifica Argentina to investigate

Southern Patagonia for scientific purposes. Having landed at Punta Arenas in

the Straits of Magellan in March, after a careful examination of the mines there

he set out in mid-August on his northward journey. After passing the Santa Cruz

valley, the exploration of the course of the Chico commenced, being the important

part of the undertaking. At the end of September the confluence of the Shebuen

and Chico was reached, and the valley of the latter followed past the curious
isolated basaltic rock Mawaish, to the confluence of a new river on the north side,
named Belgrano by the traveller. On the 19th, a lake was discovered four miles

long and two broad, fed by several streams. The valleys at the foot of the

Cordillera were thickly clothed with fragrant, evergreen, antarctic beeches of very
large size and great age, only found on the skirts of the Andes. Above these trees,

at the extreme point reached, Sefior Lista planted the flag of the Argentine

Confederation. Having examined the two northern sources of the Chico, the

southern one was also explored, and on October 30 the party returned eastward,

reaching an encampment of friendly Tehuelches in the Shehuen Valley on

November 6. These Indians are divided into two great tribes, one inhabiting

northern Patagonia, between the Chubut and Limay, and the other wandering

between the Chubut and the Straits of Magellan. These main divisions contain

many smaller clans, under about ten chiefs. The large average stature of the

Patagonians is in the main confirmed, the tallest man measured being 6 ft. 4 in.

They are indolent and addicted to gambling, but very hospitable and kind, and

Awith the chase as their only occupation.  collection of words now in use made

by Seiior Lista was found to agree very closely with those given by Pigafetta

in 1520.

Geographers are indebted not only to Lista for his explorations of the Chico,

but to his predecessor Moreno for his examination of the Santa Cruz and discovery

of two lakes. Lista has also brought home many objects of zoological and ethno-

logical interest.

  3. On Present Italian Geographical Explorations. By Gr. Dalla Vedova,

      Professor of Geography at the University of Borne, Secretary of the
      Italian Geographical Society.

     After referring to the national difficulties in the way of Italian geographical
enterprise, the writer enumerated the following modern voyages of exploration by

his countrymen :

     1. That of Renzo Manzoni, of Milan, who has twice journeyed from Aden to
Sanah in Yemen. Being prevented by native opposition from penetrating further into
the interior both at Sanah and Berbera, he has started for Hadramaut, to make

zoological collections.

    2. That of Carlo Piaggia, of Lucca, who in March 1879 started from Khartum
on his way to the Tumut River, and camped near Famaka for the rainy season,
ne has probably now left that place, as an invitation has been sent to him by the
Milan African Society to command a new expedition.

     3. That of the first Milanese Expedition for Commercial Exploration, sent out

by a society founded in 1878, with the object of opening up trade in Abyssinia and
the Red Sea, under the leadership of Dr. Pellegrino Matteucci, who has entered

Tig-re and set out for Debra-Tabor to be personally introduced to the chief, Jo-
hannes Kassa, after a stay in Adowa. His plan is to reach Shoa and the Galla

country.

     4. The Italian Expedition to Equatorial Africa. This originated in a subscrip-
tion promoted three years ago by the Italian Geographical Society, and resulted
in the departure in March 1876 of the Marquis Antinori, Engineer Giovanni
Chiarini, and Lieutenant Sebastiauo Martini-Bernardi, with the object of pene-

trating to Shoa from Zeila, then turning southwards, crossing the Galla country to

the Great Lakes, and returning to Zanzibar. At Ilarar, on the way to Shoa,

Martini was sent back to Europe for fresh supplies, in consequence of theft ; he
reached Italy and set out again in March 1877 with Captain Cenhi and reached
Shoa in the following September, finding Antinori to have lost his right hand by a
gun accident. Instead of resuming the proposed journey, Martini was once more
obliged to go back to Italy, on a mission from King Menilek, who made this a con-
dition of his support. This accomplished, he once more started from Italy, in March
last, reached Zeila, where he was met by a special caravan sent to bring him to

Shoa, and started for the interior in Jury with Count Antonelli and Signor Giu-

lietti, Antinori returning home. Meanwhile Chiarini and Cenhi started in May

1878 for Kaffa, and were last heard from under date of July 20, 1878, at Demekash

in the Guragwe country. Details of the route from Zeila to Shoa and of the phy-

sical and other conditions of the country and its inhabitants ; a political history of

Shoa, and economical and ethnological accounts of its people and of the Gallas;

astronomical determinations of positions plans and route-maps, &c, have already

the valley of the River Mantek, and is already for the greater part brought under

cultivation.

Besides these four expeditions by Italians, it is to be noted that Lieutenant

Giacomo Bove has charge of the hydrographic operations and surveys of Professor
Nordenskj old's N.E. Arctic Expedition, of which he is a member.

       The following Papers were read :

1. Journey across Africa from Benguela to Natal. By Major Serpa Pinto.

      Starting from Benguela, on the Atlantic coast, Major Pinto proceeded first to
Bihe, a native settlement in the interior, crossing different territories subjectto the
King of Portugal, and rectifying the positions of rivers, mountains, and villages,
of which the chief, subject to Portuguese authority, are Quillengues and Caconda.
In May, 1878, in obedience to the instructions of the Portuguese Government, by

whom he was sent to Africa, he left Bihe, accompanied by good native guides, his

principal object being to investigate the hydrographical system of the country
to the east-south-east of that place, as far as the Zambesi. This country, forming
the southern limit of the Benguelan highlands, stands 5,000 feet above the level
of the sea, and possesses great advantages in its salubrity and commercial and
agricultural capabilities. It is, in fact, of all tropical Africa the territory most
suitable for European colonisation.

438 repobt-- 1879.

     Owing to circumstances alien to the wishes of his Government, this journey
was performed with scarcely any resources, the party living on the product of the
chase with occasional help from friendly natives. The traveller was well supplied
with scientific instruments, having two sextants, an artificial horizon, a telescope,
several compasses, three hypsometers, a small aneroid, and thermometers. His
meteorological observations, however, were not quite continuous for the whole

period, on account of interruptions by serious illness. He brought home a great

number of chronometrical longitudes, which cannot contain important errors, as his
chronometers were continually regulated and were compared with the result of the
eclipses of the first satellite of Jupiter. In May, 1878, he had the chance of observ-
ing the transit of Mercury across the sun, and such an observation afforded a

strictly correct longitude.

    Before reaching Bihe the traveller was surprised to meet the Cubango (Kubango)
river taking its rise to the west and not to the east of that place, as all existing
maps had led him to believe. This large river receives on the east a great affluent,
the Cuito (Kwito), which unites its waters with the Cubango at a place called
Darico. Within the wide fork formed by the two rivers, the Cuanza (Kwanza, or
Quanza) takes its source with some smaller affluents.

     Here was remarked a peculiar feature in the physical geography of this part of
Africa, viz., the dovetailing of the sources of rivers which in the rest of their
courses run in opposite directions. Close to the source of the Cuito rise three
other rivers ; two of which flow into the Atlantic by the Cuanza (of which they
are tributaries), and one into the Indian Ocean through the Zambesi. The same
feature is noticeable even beyond Lake Beinba, the Congo and the Zambesi, as well as
their affluents having their sources and mingling their streams near the 12th
parallel of south latitude. East of the river Cuito, in latitude 13° S. and longitude

19° E., the Cuando (or Kwando, named Chobe by Livingstone, who saw it near

its junction with the Zambesi) takes its rise. This is a large, navigable river,
watering a great extent of inhabited and fertile country. The Cuando receives
several great affluents, as navigable as itself.

     In this region, covered by forests and where the elephant still abounds, the
traveller found the Mucassequeres, peculiar from their yellowish-white colour.
They are nomadic and perfectly savage, spending their time continually wandering
in the region between the Cuando and the Cubango. There exists likewise another

nomad tribe, the Mussambas, who are black, and wander about to the south,
making their raids as far as the country of the Sulatebele. These people are, how-
ever, quite distinct from the Massaruas or Bushmen of the Kalahari desert.

     The country between Bihe and the Zambesi is inhabited by three distinct races
the Kimbandes, the Luchares, and the Ambuellas. Another race is beginning now
to settle there ; and there is a considerable emigration of Quibocos ( Kibokwes)
coming from the north for the purpose of establishing themselves on the banks of
the Cubango and the Cuando, in their search of more fertile lands. Major Pinto
met large caravans of emigrants, and made a stay in their new settlements.

     All the above-mentioned country is splendid, and very fertile ; inhabited by
people of a docile character, susceptible of development, and strikingly fond of
dress, a disposition which points to a great prospective market for the consumption
of European manufactures.

     These tribes are governed absolutely by independent rulers, and constitute
confederations although belonging to different races. The missionary has never
reached them, nor had any European been seen among them till the arrival of
Major Pinto, who met with a cordial reception.

     Travelling eastward, the Liambai (the name given to part of the Zambesi above
the Falls) is the first river met with beyond the Cuando. As regards that part of
this great river which he examined, Major Pinto found these settlements of races
of a very different kind, and of very different customs, from those observed by

Livingstone.

    He fancies that the Liambai, where it describes its great curve to the westward,

lies more to the west than Livingstone supposed. Between the 16th parallel of
latitude and the Victoria Falls, a distance of 220 geographical miles, the river has-
seventy-two cataracts and rapids.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  439

    At the time Livingstone first visited this part of Africa, it had recently been
conquered by Chibitano (or Sebituane), who induced the native tribes to confede-
rate, thus constituting a powerful empire. Six years afterwards, during- the Zam-
besi Expedition, when he visited Seskeke, Livingstone foretold the extinction

of the Makololos, which has since taken place.

    Whilst on the Zambesi, Major Pinto met with Machuana, who had been Living-

stone's companion on his journey to Loanda, and who, being at that time a slave

belonging to King Sekeletu, is now an important individual in his capacity of a

Luina.

     On the west the Zambesi does not receive between the Liba (Leeba) and the
Ouando any other affluents, except the Lungo-e-ungo, and the Nhengo. The latter
is formed by the junction of three rivers: the Ninda, the Loati, and the Luangu-
inga. From the confluence of the Cuando as far as Victoria Falls, it receives only

one small stream close to the cataract. South of the Zambesi and the Cuando, the
land-surface of the country, which from Bihe had declined some 1,200 feet, began
slightly to rise again, and exhibited a rich vegetation. But as far as population is
concerned, this part of the country is a desert ; and only two settlements were met

with, constituting two small villages, Luchuma and Daka, the latter being situated
on a different spot from the village bearing the same name, and formerly existing

there.

     The policy adopted by the Matabeli does not permit of the settling of any tribe
on the southern border of the Zambesi. This powerful Zulu tribe look upon that

great river as their natural frontier of defence against their enemies the Luinas, and
even they themselves do not settle in that country, in consequence of the bad fevers
prevailing all along the river banks-. The soil, however, is fertile ; but the country
can never expect a prosperous future, not only in consequence of its climate, but
because of the difficulty of access to it from any point on the African coast. Here
Major Pinto met Dr. Benjamin Bradshaw, an English zoologist, and Jose Anchietta,

a Portuguese explorer, resident in Africa for eleven years, who holds an official

position under the Portuguese Government, and is employed making scientific

collections for the Zoological Museum in Lisbon. He also met with a French

missionary, M. Coillard, with his wife, a Scotch lady, and their niece, in whose
company he made his journey across from the Zambesi to the Bamangwato country,
and visited the famous Makarikari, the enormous basin into which run and are
evaporated the waters of many different rivers coming from opposite points of
African soil. There ends the Botletle, which is nothing else than the Cubango
after having made its passage through Lake Ngami. On arriving at Shoshong, the
chief town of the Bamangwato, he found its position very different from that which
it occupies on maps, as regards longitude.

      His journey from Shoshong to Pretoria was full of incident; and no less in-
teresting was that from Pretoria to Natal, during which he had as companion
Lieutenant Barker, of the 5th West York.

     Major Pinto has only given one new name during his whole journey, viz.

Baines's Desert, as he terms the country crossed between the Botletle and the

Zambesi; desiring to render honour to Thomas Baines, one of those who have

worked most laboriously in the interior of Southern Africa.
     Some small zoological collections were made ; but the traveller's attention wa s

specially given to the different races, customs, and habits which he had the oppor-

tunity of observing during the course of his journey.

           2. The Basin of the Ogowe. Bij M. Savorgnan de Beazza.

    The largest area in Africa now unexplored is to the north of the equator from
the Congo to Lake Chad, and from the Ogow6, on the western side to the country
of the Nyam-Nyam, visited by Dr. Schweinfurth. From the western coast this
unknown region has been entered by the French Expedition under M. Savorgnan de
Brazza and Dr. Ballay, which left Bordeaux in August, 1875, to explore the whole
course of the river Ogowe, reaching the Gaboon on October 20. They succeeded in
hiring canoes, and commenced the ascent of the river in the following year, making
440 KEroRT-- 1879.

their first halt at a village called Lope. From this station Brazza set out to explore

the country of the Fans, a very difficult and hazardous journey. Thence the ex-
pedition advanced to Douru6, on the upper part of the Ogowti, where its course is
from south-east to north-west. Doume" is about 50 miles south of the equator.
After a serious illness Brazza was obliged to return to the coast, but he rejoined his
party at Doume" in April, 1877, and reached the Poubara Falls in 1° 45' S. Here
the Ogowe, flowing from the south, becomes an insignificant stream, and it was not
considered necessary to follow its course any farther.

    But here the most important part of M. Brazza's work commenced. He re-

solved, in spite of the sufferings he and his party had already gone through, and
the diminished stock of provisions, to leave the basin of the Ogow6, and penetrate
farther eastward into the unknown interior. The region they had to traverse was

devastated by famine, and they suffered much from hunger and thirst. After
crossing the water-parting, they followed the course of a stream which brought them

to a great and previously undiscovered river flowing eastward called the Alima. It
was 150 yards in width, and there can be very little doubt that the Alima is a
tributary of the Congo. The inhabitants proved to be hostile, a people devoted to
war and pillage, and the explorers were attacked from all the villages they passed,
and chased by canoes. Leaving the river, they took a northerly course, and crossed
several streams flowing to the east, like the Alima. After having crossed the large
river Licona, on the equator, and penetrated to a place called Okanga, some 30 miles
farther north, M. de Brazza found it necessary to retrace his steps on August 11,

1*76, arriving at the Gaboon on November 30. He described the region between

the rivers Ogowe" and Alima as 50 miles across, consisting of hills of moderate height,
with many easy passes.

5. The Euphrates Valley Railway. By Commander V. L. Cameron, B.N.

6. On Broposed Inch-Mediterranean Baihuays, ivith an Account of a Journey
        by Land from Bagdad to Bushire. By Wilfrid Scawen Blunt.

      After discussing the routes which have been proposed for a railway to Bagdad,
 viz. by Palmyra, the Euphrates Valley, and the Tigris (all of which are considered
 more or less impracticable), and also alluding to a possibly feasible line, adhering
 pretty closely to the existing caravan road which passes through Orfa, Mardin,
 Nisibin, Mosul, and Kerkuk, approaching Bagdad eventually from the north, the

 author described his own experiences (in company with his wife, Lady Anne

 Blunt) of the last 500 miles of the proposed route.
      Starting from Bagdad on March 19, Mr. Blunt landed on a peninsula of the Tigris

 called El Wudian. There are very few settlements on the left bank of the river,
 partly on account of danger from the Persian frontier, but principally from the in-
 different nature of the soil, which contains a good deal of saltpetre and is in parts

 unhealthily swampy. On the third day the party left in search of a camp of Beni
 Laam Bedouins, said to be five days' journey off in a nearly easterly direction.

      Their road lay across a very barren plain, varied only by occasional swamps,

 and now and then a patch of spotted thistle, on which their camels fed vora-
 ciously. The Hamrin hills are not more than fifteen miles from the river at its

 nearest point, and run in a perfectly straight line north-west by soiith-east. There
 is no cultivation at all away from the river bank, and but a few Bedouins were
 met, living in groups of only three or four tents together, on account of the
 scantiness of the pasture. They seldom had camels (for it is a poor camel country),
 but sheep or goats, and a few half-starved cows.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  441

      On the fifth day Mr. Blunt came to the camp situated on the bank of the Tibb,
 a river about fifty yards wide, and at the ford from three to four feet deep. The
 Tibb rises beyond the Hamrin hills, which it cuts through, and after flowing for
 about fifty miles across the plain, joins the Tigris at Amara. They were now close

 under these hills, and found the soil good and carrying a rich crop of grass.

      Here the servants and camel men refused to accompany the party further,

 as they were afraid to venture across the frontier, which has a very bad reputation
 as the haunt of robbers and outlaws. Only the cavass remained, and they were
 forced to load and drive the camels themselves.

      About thirty miles from the Tibb, the party came to a very similar river, the
 Dueri, which they had some difficulty in crossing. It was much swollen by the
 melting snows, and the horses had to swim. It was not too deep, however, for the
 camels, and like the Tibb had a good gravelly bottom. Another thirty miles
 brought them to the Kerkha, a much more formidable river, having a great
 volume of water three hundred yards across and running at the rate of about six
 miles an hour. Here they found a Persian prince living in exile with a Kurdish

 tribe, and put themselves under his protection.
      The country passed over between the Tibb and the Kerkha is a low roDing

 down, the last ripple in fact of the Hamrin hills, bare of trees and bushes,
 but covered for the most part with excellent sheep pasture. There is, however, an

 interval of about ten miles immediately east of the Dueri, where desert gravel is
 found with the usual desert vegetation. The river banks are thickly wooded with
 tamarisk and arghal jungle, and are said to contain numerous lions of the Persian
breed (not the maneless lion of the Euphrates). The whole of this strip, sixty

 miles across, is uninhabited, although the pasture is excellent and the country well

 watered.

      They crossed the Kerkha on a raft, and found cultivation and soon after villages
on the opposite side. The Kerkha is indeed the boundary here of Persia. The
 party passed within sight of the ruins of Susa, and the same evening arrived at

 Dizful.

       Dizful is a large town, the capital of the province of Luristan. It contains
perhaps 20,000 inhabitants, and is the centre of a considerable trade. It is the
 market of all the pastoral tribes of the Bactiari mountains, and stands in a really
rich agricultural district. Between it and Sinister they passed several villages and

a fair amount of cultivation. Sinister is a town of about the same size as Dizful,
and both stand upon large rivers resembling the Kerkha, and crossed by ancient
stone bridges of twenty and twenty-two arches. These three rivers, uniting lower
down, form the Karun, the third of the rivers of Eden.

     Once past Shuster the road became deserted. On the whole seventy miles
between it and Ramuz they found not a single village, and only three Bedouin
encampments. The nomads here again are Arabs, but so poor and so ruthlessly

oppressed by the Persian government, that their flocks are unable to pasture a
hundredth part of the good grass land, which is abundant and well watered. The
soil, a rich red earth, would produce excellent crops and at little cost in labour,

for the rainfall here at the edge of the hills may be depended on. The Persian

government, however, is systematically destroying agricultural wealth in Arabistan,
which, though belonging to Persia, is treated like an enemy's country and is rapidly
becoming depopulated. Beyond Ramuz, Mr. Blunt travelled through miles of

standing corn, self-sown now for several years, though the deserted villages seemed

hardly yet in decay. Gardens with vines and fruit trees still surrounded the
houses, but there was nobody to gather the fruit.

     Bebahan is a considerable place, equal perhaps to Shuster, and though a decay-
ing town, is still the centre of no little wealth. It stands in a fertile district, and
the inhabitants being Persians have been less ruthlessly treated. Bebahan lies,
however, out of the direct route to Bushire, a"nd is surrounded by an intricate line
of hills, so that a railway could not easily pass that way. It stands about a thou-
sand feet above the sea. The descent towards the coast is by a series of precipitous
clifls, and after passing two more rivers the level plain which skirts the coast is
reached. Mr. Blunt struck the Persian Gulf at the little town of Dilam.

    From the time Shuster was left, the party had run considerable risk from the
--442 report 1879.

unsettled state of the country, the few villages that remained were at war with
each other, and it was almost impossible to induce any one to serve as guide or
accompany as servant. On the coast, however, all was comparatively civilised. The
inhabitants of the little towns along the Gulf, though given to piracy by sea, are
peaceable on shore, and there are no Bedouins to make travelling unsafe. The
country indeed is very barren, a uniform plain of saltpetrous clay intersected by
tidal creeks and salt morasses. There is but one low range of hills, and these
would offer no serious obstacle to a railway.

    Mr. Blunt's party had now been travelling for many days and nights almost
without rest, and were nearly exhausted from heat and flies. When at last, on

April 28, worn out and almost in rags, they alighted at the English Residency at
Bushire, the sepoys at the gate refused them entrance. They could not understand
that they were British subjects or honest people of any sort.

     They had travelled five hundred miles, crossed nine considerable rivers, passed
through three large towns and about a dozen villages. About fifty miles of the
route had been through well-cultivated districts, and fifty more through intermit-
tent cultivation ; the rest may be fairly described as an uninhabited waste.

 7. The Physical Aspects of Zululand and Natal. By Beauchamp Tower.

     The water-parting of this part of South Africa is formed by the Drakensberg, a
range of mountains which runs parallel with and about 150 miles from the coast of
the Indian Ocean. The descent from the Drakensberg to the sea is over an irregular
surface of mountain and valley, the mountains gradually diminishing to low undu-
lating hills near the sea. But between the 27th and 28th parallels of south
latitude a range branches out nearly at right angles with the Drakensberg, which
is 7000 to 8000 feet high, and again between 29 and 30 S. there is another
range between two branches of which stands the capital of Natal. There is thus
an area bounded on three sides by mountain ranges, and on the fourth by the sea

which includes the northern part of Natal, nearly all Zululand, and the SE. cor-
ner of the Transvaal.

     This area is one mass of alternate mountains and valleys ; many of the hills
having a peculiar table-topped form. They are of granite capped by huge slabs
of sandstone, which seem the remnant of a broadly spread pavement formerly
continuous with the central table land. One of the finest specimens of these
table mountains is the Inhlazatye, which rises on the north bank of the White
Univolosi to a height of about 6000 feet. The principal river is the Tugela, which
drains the greater part of the area. The only others of any size are the Univoti,

on the Natal side, and the Umlatoosi and Univolosi in Zululand. After describ-
ing the rivers, Mr. Tower dwelt upon the beauty of the scenery, and gave some
details respecting the climate, the vegetation, and the character and habits of the

people.

 --1. Afghan War The Jellalabad Region. By William Simpson, Special

                          Artist of ' The Illustrated London News'

      Having been attached to the Peshawur Field Force under General Sir Samuel
 Browne, the author accompanied it from the Khyber as far as C4unduniuck. The
 troops were quartered for over three months at Jellalabad, and during that time he
 had opportunities for making himself acquainted with the region. The tendency
 of his explorations, beyond his own proper sphere as an artist, was rather archaeo-
 logical than geographical. Still, the ancient remains of a country belong un-
 doubtedly to its geography, and have in all cases to be considered as a portion of
 our knowledge of any locality under consideration ; and no account of the Jellalabad
 Valley would be complete without some notice of the Buddhist remains to be
 found there. Mr. Simpson was aware previously of the existence of these remains,

but what astonished him was the vast quantity of them still to be seen. On all
 sides are extensive mounds and heaps, that being the condition in most cases of
 these remains. Here and there structures may be found, which, although in
ruins, yet bear on them some traces of architecture. At Hada, about five miles

 south of Jellalabad, are some elevated ridges, extending to a considerable distance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

 these are in the present day a mass of undulating heaps, marking the site of a city
 of monasteries and shrines, which was celebrated in the Buddhist period. This is
 about the only one of these Buddhist groups which has retained its ancient

 name: it was called Hi-lo, or Hidda, by Fah Hian. Here, we know from

 the Chinese Pilgrims, was exhibited in a most costly shrine the skull-bone
 of Buddha; and not far from this was a cave with a miraculous shadow

 of Buddha, a spot which the Buddhist devotees all visited. At the

 western end of the valley, on the south of the road to Kabool, there

--are some low hills of conglomerate ; here for a number of miles are caves,

 mounds, and topes the remains of what have been Buddhist monasteries. The
 western end of the Jellalabad Valley is terminated by the Siah Koh, or ' Black
 Mountain ' range, and along the base of this rocky mass, towards Duranta, is
another extensive collection of similar ruins. Here some of the topes are not so
 dilapidated, and their architectural features can still be traced. Crossing the
Kabool Eiver we find, on the left bank, about a mile or so from Duranta, another
very large group of mounds, topes, and caves. This group extends for about three
miles. On the same side of the river are the districts of Besoot and Kamah.
Although not so familiar with them, still, in an expedition which the author accom-
panied against the Momonds, he noted the existence of Buddhist remains on the
lower ridges of the hills; as a rale, elevated ground seems generally to have been
selected for these religious establishments, and they all commanded good views of

the valley. At Mirza Kheyl, which is in the Kamah district, and close on the

eastern end of the valley, is a mass of white rock covered with remains. Near this
is an island in the river called Girdao, with the ruins of an extensive monastery.
This list of the larger groups is far from being exhaustive, on account of numerous
remains of lesser importance scattered about.

     One point is apparently clear, that in the Buddhist period the population of the
Jellalabad Valley must have been much more numerous than at present, and that the
area of cultivation must have been also more extensive. The topes were large and
elaborate architectural structures, and the author believes the same might be said
of the monasteries, for the explorations produced sculptures and plaster figures in
great quantities, which had been all painted with bright colours, and in many cases
thickly gilt. The wealth necessary to construct such a mass of buildings, as well

as the maintenance of them, and the large population of monks who lived in these

places, must have been great. The scanty number of people in the region at this
day would be quite insufficient to support them. The Buddhist ascetic priests-
                    ;

--444 report 1879.

must have been, judging by the remains, two or three times greater than the

present population. Kamah is well cultivated, but on the Jellalabad side there is

only a narrow strip along the bank of the Kabool and Surkhab rivers under culti-

vation ; the remainder of the valley is covered with sand and boulders. At Girdi

Kas, where the river flows out of the valley at the eastern end, are the remains of
an aqueduct and an old road. The last is known as the Badshah-i-Rah, or the
' Imperial Road,' and it was supposed from its name to have been made by one of
the Emperors of India. Our engineers made repairs on this road, and from the
officers engaged on this work Mr. Simpson received the information that portions
of ' Buddhist masonry ' are still to be seen on it, showing it is older than the Bad-

shahs who ruled in Delhi, and that regularly constructed ways were made in the
more civilised period of Buddhism, a kind of public work which the Afghan has
long ceased to trouble himself about. While the engineers were at work at this

spot, they also discovered an old aqueduct constructed along with the road, with a
considerable tunnel through one of the hills by which the water was led to the

Chardeh Plain, on the east of the Jellalabad Valley, and which is now a desert of

stones, and so dangerous from heat that no native of the country, they were told,
would venture to pass over it in June or July in the daytime. The aqueduct dis-
covered by the officers is a pretty clear evidence that this wilderness- of boulders
was at some former period under cultivation. In this case archaeology is of some
value as throwing light on the past, and the contrast is not favourable to the con-

dition of the country in its present condition. Further valuable light drawn from
the same source was afforded by Major Cavagnari (now Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon
Cavagnari), supplying the author with a working party to make excavations at the
Ahin Posh Tope, about a mile south from Jellalabad. The principal object was

to explore the architectural details of the remains, but while thus engaged, the
author penetrated, by means of a tunnel, cut for about 45 feet through solid
masonry, to the central cell of the shrine, and found along with what were most
probably the ashes of some Buddhist saint of high repute, twenty gold coins, each

about the size of a sovereign. Seventeen of these were Bactrian, or Indo-Scythian
and three were Roman. One belonged to Domitian, another to Trajan, and the

third to ' Sabina Augusta,' the wife of Hadrian. Evidence of a road has already

been given, and these coins prove that at a past date a commerce went along that
road ; and it must have been a commerce of considerable importance which brought

coins all the way from ancient Rome in its track.

   We know that in the Buddhist period the capital city of the Jellalabad region

was called Nagarahara. When Mr. Simpson started for the Afghan War, Colonel

Yule called his attention to this, as a point of importance, and that the fixing of its
site would be of some value. This task the author thinks he has accomplished.
About four miles to the west of Jellalabad there is an isolated rock which stands
up out of the plain. It is covered with the debris of former structures, amidst
which a little careful examination soon discovers remains of ' Buddhist masonry.'
This rock, the natives say, was the Bala Hissar of an old. Kaffir city. The word
' Kaffir ' means, in the mouth of a Mahomedan, an ' infidel,' and they apply the word
to everything pre-Mahomedan ; hence all the old Buddhist remains they tell you are
'Kaffir log Ke.' There are long mounds to be seen in different places around,
apparently the vestiges of the old walls, and the quantity of stones scattered about

has led the people to call the place Wuttapoor, or the ' City of Stones.' It is also
called Begram, which some authorities have rendered ' Chief City.' Our surveyors,

in the new map made during the campaign, give one place here, for there are a
number of villages within the space of the old city, as ' Nagarat,' which is no

--doubt a contraction of Nagarahara Fah Hian, the Buddhist Pilgrim, uses the word

' Nagrak ' (Beal's Trans., p. 40). Close to the old rock the author made a very
partial exploration of a large tope, and the name of it as given by the villagers
was Nagara Goondi, the last word here meaning a ' knoll ' or ' mound,' and which
is used in relation to all topes when they have been reduced to a simple heap.
This name would therefore mean the ' Nagara Tope,' and in these words Mr. Simp-
son thinks we have the remains of the old name, and they form a very strong
evidence, when added to what is already given, that this is the site of the old
Buddhist city of Nagarahara. Its position would have been a strong one. It was
                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.               445.

protected on the north by the Kabool river, and on the west by the Surkhab, and
there is another smaller stream on the east, which may have been the boundary
on that side. On the opposite bank of the river is the Pheel Khana group of
topes and caves, which would overlook the city, and form a picturesque suburb in

that direction ; on the west there would be the Duranta monasteries on the lower
skirts of the Siah Koh, also overlooking the city and forming another pleasant

suburb for the Buddhist devotees of the city to stroll to and worship at the various
shrines. The Char Bagh group is a little more distant on the south, but still near

enough to be looked upon as a part of the capital city. The city, when in its days
of splendour, was not only a fine one, securely situated, and surrounded with impo-

sing architectural temples and monastical buildings full of statues and pictures,

resplendent with gold and every bright colour, but it was a good strategical situa-
tion, commanding at once the entrance to Lughman, the Kunar Valley, and the

hijjh road to Kabool.

--2. Afghan War. The Kuram Valley. By Captain Gerald Martin.

Captain Gerald Martin (writing from the Peiwar Kotal) reported on the survey

operations conducted by officers of the Indian Survey Department attached to the

' Kuram Column                                                                     of the Afghanistan expeditionary force.  Captain Woodthorpe,
                                                                                '

Captain Martin, and Lieutenant Manners Smith were the surveyors, and the area com-

prised the whole of the Kuram Valley and the district of Khost to the south,

representing an addition to our geographical knowledge of 4,500 square miles!

Captain Martin gave a short summary of the movements of the troops, includino-

the battle on the Peiwar Pass, the march to Shutor-gardan, the action in the

Mangior defile, and the advance into Khost. The surveyors accompanied all the

more important reconnaissances.

     The report then described the sources and the course of the river Kuram with
its numerous tributaries, as well as the Shamil and other rivers in Khost. The
account of the rivers was followed by an enumeration and description of all the
principal routes up the Kuram Valley, and of those branching from it to Khost or

across the Safaid-Koh range to Jellalabad. The towns, or rather chief villages,

were then enumerated and described, and some information was given respecting
the climate of the Kuram Valley. Captain Martin next gave a general description

of the country, dwelling on the beauty of the scenery at several points, and specially

on the magnificent views of the Safaid-Koh and other mountain ranges. Several
peaks and important passes in the Safaid-Koh range were visited by the surveyors,
and Captain Martin gave an interesting account of journeys to the Lakerai and'
Shutor-gardan Passes, and of an ascent of the Sikeram peak, the loftiest in the

Safaid-Koh range, and 15,600 feet above the sea. He also explained the great

value of the heliograph in field signalling, and for triangulation. During this expe-
dition communication was kept up by means of a 3-inch heliograph, at a "distance of
34 miles.

     The paper concluded with a very interesting account of the botany of the
Kuram Valley and of its forest-clad slopes (which was furnished by Dr. Aitchison)
and with a detailed account of the Hill tribes.

      --3. Afghan War. Country between Kandahar and Oirishlc.

                           By Captain B. Beavan, F.B.0.8.

     Captain P. Beavan, F.R.G.S. (writing from Kandahar), describes the country
between Kandahar and Girishk, which was traversed by the division under the

command of Major-General Biddulph in January and February, 1879. Girishk
on the right bank of the river Halmand, is of great importance as a military position'

because it lies at the extremity of the vast mountain masses that break up the whole'

country between the Halmand and the Arghastan into a troubled sea of rock.

Skirting the route to the south lies the great sandy desert, equally impassable for
troops. Thus the tract from Girishk to Kandahar forms practically the sole mili-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

tary passage between India on the one hand, and Persia or Turkistan on the other.
It is for armies what the Suez Canal is for ships.

      The narrow strip of plain which this route traverses forms the interval between
the desert and the hilly country. The desert rolls up in undulating sand hills from
the far south. It is bounded by the rivers Arghandab and Dori, the thin lines of
running water seeming as if they had some magic influence in restraining the over-
flow of the sand. To the north are the mountains, bare and rugged, not a sign of
verdure anywhere about them, not an indication of moisture. The great peculiarity

of the country is that only the upper portions of the hills are exposed above ground.
The whole country, including the lateral valleys, appears to have been filled up at a
date subsequent to the elevation of the hills with a deposit of rubble, waterworn

boulders and pebbles, with hardly sufficient soil to hold them together. The

elevation of this part of the country is over 3,000 feet above the sea. This deposit,
though apparently level, in reality slopes considerably upwards from the rivers to
the base of the hills, while the valleys have a slope in the direction of their length.

Captain Beavan then explained how this formation aided the peculiar system of
irrigation by means of karez or underground aqueducts, which is constantly made

use of in this part of Afghanistan.

     At the junction of the two rivers Halmand and Arghandab, and from this point
along the banks of the Halmand to a considerable distance above Girishk, are scat-

tered the remains of numerous forts and entrenchments, showing the importance
that has always attached to this part of the Halmand river. Girishk itself is
simply a fort, commanding the Herat road. There is no town near it, but the
whole of the Halmand valley is full of small, scattered villages, with gardens, trees,
and fields. To the north-west from Girishk, by the Herat road, the country is
mountainous, and again towards the north-east, but in a northerly direction it
appears quite open and level as far as the eye can see. The only exception is that,
on very clear mornings after rain, a few snowy peaks are visible, just showing their
tops above the horizon. Captain Beavan found the old position of Girishk fairly
correct, and he ascertained the heights of the camping grounds along the route from

Kandahar to Girishk by aneroid and boiling point. He concluded his paper with

some valuable suggestions on the subject of the formula for barometric heights.

              --4. Afghan War. The Pishin Valley.

                    By Lieutenant St. George C. Gore, B.E.

     Lieutenant St. George C. Gore (writing from Gulistan,in Pishin) described the

Pishin Valley, which is now to be annexed by the British Government. Its

extreme length is about 48 miles, and its average width, including the hill ranges
on either side, from 25 to 30 miles. Its two sides are formed by the parallel ranges
of the Khwaja-Amran on the west, and the Mashalak-Ajiram (or Ghazarband
range) on the east ; the southern end being shut across by spurs of hilly ground
which separate Pishin from Shorawak. The upper end of the Pishin valley is shut
in by the high plateau of Toba on the north, and the ridges running between the

Kand and Takatu mountains on the east.
     The valley of Pishin is a perfectly open, nearly flat alluvial plain, with a very

barren aspect owing to the absence of trees, except fruit trees in a few gardens.
     Lieutenant Gore described the Khwaja-Amran mountains bounding the Pishin

valley on the west, which are but a spur of the Suliman range, the water-parting
being continuous and well marked from the Kand Peak along the southern edge of

the Toba plateau and thence down the Khwaja-Amran range. He also gave full

details respecting the river Lora, which waters the Pishin valley, and its affluents
the irrigation system by means of karez ; the passes over the mountain ranges ; and

the inhabitants of the valley.

--5. Afghan War. Shoraivak Valley and Tola Plateau.

                 By Major Campbell, B.E.

Major Campbell described the Shorawak valley and the Toba plateau in

Afghanistan. The Shorawak valley had never been visited by Europeans before

the recent campaign. It is a narrow strip of flat country lying between the desert

on the west and north-west, and a range generally known as the Sarlat Hills to

the east. Its total length is about 40 miles, with a width of 10 miles at the

northern end                                                      and it is 3,250 feet  above the  sea.  The head of the valley, to the
                                                               ;

north, is closed in by the southern spurs of the Khwaja-Amran range of mountains,

which nearly join the north-western spurs of the Sarlat Hills, only leaving a gap

of about a mile through which the Lora river runs into the valley.

The desert, which stretches away westward as far as the Persian frontier, rolls up

in the form of sand hills to the edge of the cultivated land of the valley. The Lora

river, which waters the valley, runs nearly dry in summer, and its water is always

brackish, whence the name of the valley from the Persian words Shot- (brackish),
and Abak (scarcity of water). The valley is thickly populated, and crops of wheat

and barley are raised. _ Major Campbell suggested that Shorawak was once a lake,
which was^ gradually silted up by deposits from the Lora, and this seems to account

for most of the phenomena. The river, after flowing through the valley, is swal-

lowed up in the sand of the desert.

The Toba table-land is at the north-eastern extremity of the Khwaja-Amran

range of mountains. It was visited by Major Campbell last May. The crest of
the Khwaja-Amran bifurcates at a short distance north-east of the Khojak Pass, one

line running nearly due east, and the other about north-north-east. Between these
two crests there is an elevated mountain mass extending eastward until it merges

in the general confused mountain system in that direction. This table-land° is
divided into two portions, called Toba and Tabin ; the former on the southern and

eastern edge, the latter on the western side. They are separated by a narrow line

of hills, running about north-east by east. The general elevation is over 7,000 feet.
Major Campbell gave an interesting account of this plateau and of its inhabitants.

It will probably form an excellent hill sanatorium for the troops stationed in the

Pishin Valley. The climate of the plateau in summer is very pleasant.

       6. Neio Routes to Candahar. By Captain T. H. Holdich, B.E.

    In weighing the capabilities of the various passes now known to exist in the

mountain barrier of Western and North-Western India, with the important
political and strategical object of selecting the best main route to Candahar, the
author commenced by stating his objections to those in use at present. Admitting

that Karachi may prove the best base for communication with our frontier posts as

they stand at present at Quetta and Pishin, he considered that the direct Son
Miani route,_connecting the coast with Biela, Khelat, and Quetta, though passing
through a friendly country, would be too great a burden to maintain, as it traverses
a wild, unproductive, and most unpromising region. The Jacobabad-Bholan route
on the western side of the Indus is also open to the periodical danger of inundation
by that river (resulting last year in the isolation of Jacobabad itself from Sukkur
by thirty-eight miles of water), and to the restriction of its use to cold weather,
owing to the painful and disastrous effects of crossing the Kachi desert in the hot

season.

     The journeys, however, of the native explorers, instructed by Colonel Browne,
through the previously unknown district lying between the Quetta-Pishin line and
the Sulimani range, have resulted in the accumulation of material sufficient to
warrant the march of a column under General Biddulph from Candahar eastwards
towards Dera Ghazi Khan, which has been selected as the base on the Indian side
on account of its proximity to Mooltan on the Indus Valley Bailway, and its
avoiding a desert passage to the hills. The object of this march was to investigate
the various practicable caravan and other routes said to exist between the Pishin
--448 report 1879.

Valley and Dera Ghazi. Starting from Kushdil Khan, at the eastern end of the
Pishin Valley, this expedition reached Bolozai, in the Surkhab valley, by crossing
the Suranari Pass, and here were discovered two great rivers, the Zhob and Bhori,
radiating eastwards through open valleys, and affording the finest openings for a route
to India. The Zhob, which trended too much northwards, was not followed, but
apparently would strike the frontier ranges at the Gulere (or Gomul) Pass.. The
Bhori Valley was reached from Bolozai by following the bed of the Surkhab river by
Yusuf Kutch to the Ushtara Pass (a wide and convenient one), the sandstone hills
culminating at Mashkwar in grand and vividly coloured scenery, contrasting
strongly with the usually tame aspect of the Candahar region. Thence, from
Ohimjan through the Bhori Valley to Anumbar, the road recalled the Lombardy
plains. Part of the expedition turned southwards at Katz, via Smalan and Baghao,
with the intent of exploring the Thall and Chotiali route ; but the main party kept
the straight road, following the river to Anumbar, and reached the Chimalang

Valley by the Treek Kuram Pass, whence they struck south among winding
precipitous ranges to Baladaka, eventually arriving by the Han Pass and Hasni

Kot to the valley of Lugari Barkan.
     This valley is open to the Kaho Pass by Vitakari, and reaches the Derajat plain

about forty miles south of Dera Ghazi. All this road is capable of easily carrying

a railway, and as it now is will exist for ever ; it could be shortened by not
striking south at the Treek Kuram Pass, but keeping eastward and south-eastward
on the Karwaddi route via Rakni to the Port Monro or Sakki Sarwar Passes,
opening opposite Dera Ghazi. The party that followed the Thall and Chotiali

route also reached the Lugari Barkan Valley, but no good direct route could be
found between Thall and Vitakari, which is a desirable position at the head of the

Chachar Pass.
     The chief addition to our knowledge from this expedition is that the hitherto

unknown region between the Pishin Valley and the Sulimani Range is found to be
open, rich, and fertile, with nothing in its physical characters preventing travel

across it in almost any direction.

--7. Afghan War. Surveys round Kandahar. By Major Rogers, B.JE.

Captain Malcolm Rogers, R.E. (writing from Kandahar), gave an account of

the recent survey operations in Baluchistan and Southern Afghanistan. During

the march to Kandahar the work was restricted to a route survey of the immediate

line of march ; and the careful survey made during the former Afghan war by

Lieutenant Durand, R.E., was found to be very correct. Captain Rogers, however,

connected his work near Quetta with points on the Khwaja-Amran range of moun-

tains, and thence fixed points on the great plain stretching from the mountains to

Kandahar. He climbed the highest hill of the range, whence its name is derived,

which is 8,960 feet above the sea.

Between the Khwaja-Amran mountains and Kandahar there is a vast plain,

with numerous detached hills and ranges, mostly of limestone. There is little

water, and the general appearance is treeless and barren. To the westward this

plain is bounded by a vast desert of rolling sand-hills. The river Dori is the only

perennial stream in this plain.

Captain Rogers accompanied General Stewart when he advanced from Kandahar

to Kalat-i-Ghilzai, and carried on a route survey ; but the division followed on the

track of the army of 1839, and there was not much to add to former work. The
troops advanced up the valley of the Tanak, the river being rapid and muddy in
January, and having cut for itself a deep winding channel. There were many

villages on both banks. During the stay of the army at the fort of Kalat-i-Ghilzai,

the surrounding country was mapped. "When the troops returned to Kandahar,

arrangements were made for small columns to march back by the valleys of the

Arghastan and Arghandab. Thus 50 miles of the courses of these two rivers above

AKandahar were surveyed.         trigonometrical survey of the country for 12 miles

round Kandahar was also executed ; and an expedition was sent into the Khakrez

valley, about 30 miles north of Kandahar. It drains into the river Arghandab,
from which it is separated by a range of low hills. The longitude of Kandahar was
fixed by electric telegraph.

       8. On the Orography of the North-Western Frontier of India.
                                 By Trelawny Saunders.

     The paper divides the mountains into groups, to each of which distinct limits are
assigned. The several parts of certain groups are then discussed, for the purpose
of assigning definite limits to the nomenclature of each part. The parallelism of
the ranges with the axis and base of the mass is next enlarged upon, with a view

to expose the fallacious assumption of the prevalence of formidable spurs obstruct-
ing lateral communication. Various examples of prolonged lateral communications
in the mountains on the north-western frontier of India are cited. In conclusion
the southern part of the high land extending along the Arabian Sea and the Per-
sian Gulf from the plain of the Indus to the plain of Mesopotamia is referred to,
especially with reference to the proper line of the future railway to India.

     The low land along this coast is particularly objected to for a railway, on

Aaccount of its deadly climate and an atmosphere reeking with intensely hot vapour.

   chain of elevated valleys running parallel to the coast is traced by way of Shiraz

and Kej as a preferable railway route.

9. Imperial Survey of India. By J. 0. N. James, Esq., Deputy-

                       Superintendent of the Surveys of India.

     The object of Mr. James's paper was to sketch out, in a concise manner, the
nature of the work in progress and already performed by the Indian Survey Depart-
ment, and to point out its practical utility. The Imperial Survey of India, up to a

late period, consisted of three distinct branches, namely, the Trigonometrical Topo-
graphical, and Revenue Surveys. The Trigonometrical Survey, besides its'purely

scientific work, furnishes the great basis by principal triangulation for the orio-in
and extension of detail surveys executed by the Topographical and Revenue
Branches. Already the whole of India is covered with principal triangulation
which, for scientific accuracy, is unsurpassed by any similar undertaking in the
world. To the Topographical Branch is assigned the labour of executing geo-
graphical surveys of native States and hilly or forest tracts in British territory usually
on a scale of one inch to the mile. Mr. James described the methods adopted in the
execution of these topographical surveys, and pointed out the vast amount of geo-
graphical information which is collected by the surveyors. During the administra-
tion of Sir Henry Thuillier, late Surveyor-General of India (1861 to 1877), an area
of not less than 290,000 square miles was surveyed and mapped, including the
wildest and least known tracts of India. This enormous area, more than double
the size of Great Britain and Ireland, was surveyed in sixteen years at an average

cost ot 21. the square mile.

The Revenue Survey operations are chiefly confined to open and well cultivated

districts in British territory. They furnish complete and accurate records of the
area and boundaries of every village and district. They show the extent of waste
and cultivated land, the nature of the soil, and the principal features of the country
on a scale of four inches to the mile. From these original surveys excellent maps
of complete districts are completed on various scales, for general administrative
purposes. In some special districts the system of cadastral field surveys has been
introduced. During Sir Henry Thuilliers superintendence (from 1847 to 1877) an
area of 40-3 000 square miles was completed on the village survey system on a scale
ot four inches to the mile, and 12,281 square miles by cadastral measurement
on a scale of 16 and 32 inches to the mile ; making an aggregate of 505,574 square
miles, considerably more than double the area of France. The Revenue Surveys
comprise a great portion of Bengal and Assam, all Oudh, part of the North-West
          Provinces and Bombay, nearly all the Punjab, and all Sind.

    This work has not been accomplished without the sacrifice of many valuable
lives, and the necessity of facing dangers and hardships of no common kind. The
zeal and devotion of the Indian surveyors are beyond all praise ; and their work

has been and continues to be most valuable. It must, however, be clearly under-
stood that a considerable portion of what has been accomplished by the Topogra-
phical Branch of the Department is nothing more than a first survey, rapidly
executed, for geographical and general administrative purposes. Hereafter more
rigorously accurate and complete surveys will be needed. Meanwhile there is not

a single official in India who does not possess maps of the portion of the country
included in his jurisdiction, which are suited to every present requirement. The
maps issued by the Surveyor-General's Department are also utilised by engineers
in the construction of public works, by the foresters for conservancy purposes, by
mining companies, planters, holders of estates, and by every branch of the civil

and military services for purposes too numerous to detail.

10. Three Months in Cyprus. By Samuel Brown, M.I.G.JS.

Having had charge of certain preliminary surveys undertaken with a view to

the improvement of the harbour, inland communications, and sanitary condition of

Cyprus, as well as the development of its material resources, the author, during
three months of constant travelling and camp life last winter and spring, had. oppor-
tunities enjoyed by few Englishmen since the occupation in July 1878, of making

himself acquainted with the place and people.

After describing first impressions on approaching the southern coast, the bare

treeless desert-like aspect of the hills behind Larnaca, the road thence to Nicosia

and from Nicosia across the great Mesavoria plain to Famagosta, as they appeared

late in the year before the rainy season had set in, the author confesses to the dis-

appointment he shared with other visitors after reading the couleur de rose descrip-

tions during the early days of the occupation. First impressions were, however,

greatly modified by subsequent experience. About Christmas heavy rain fell, and

in a few days the aspect of the country changed. The great corn-growing plains

became green, and the moorlands and pastures afforded herbage for large flocks of

sheep and goats, while the ground was thickly studded with wild flowers, chiefly

narcissus, anemones, cyclamen, and two species of lily. And although the eastern

part of the island, including the districts of Larnaca, Nicosia, and Famagosta (i.e.

those parts best known to visitors) is painfully destitute of trees and shrubs, this

does not hold good of other parts. The park-like beauty of portions of the Litnasol

coast district, the secluded and exquisitely beautiful valleys of Kythrea and Lefka,

rival on a small scale for rich sub-tropical vegetation anything that is met with in

countries bordering the Mediterranean. The winter climate of the south-west coast

is warm and balmy, and probably is hardly surpassed by that of any fashionable

health resort. In artistic beauty, too, the fantastic form of the northern range, and

the grander masses of Troados with its romantic valleys, may well compare with

the scenery of any neighbouring island.

The fruit-producing capacity of Cyprus is almost unlimited, but needs for its

development irrigation, better cultivation, and roads for the conveyance of produce

Ato market.  great extension of vine culture is anticipated. Last year the

Limasol district alone produced 1,622,500 gallons of wine, against 618,000 during

the preceding year, being an increase of 270 per cent. This wonderful advance is

accounted for chiefly by the removal of certain vexatious conditions attached to the

making of wine, due to the ingenuity of the Turkish tax farmer.

     The population, estimated approximately at 200,000, consists probably of about
three-fourths Greek Christians and one-fourth Mohammedans. No census has yet

been made. Both Turks and Greeks are indolent, unambitious, self-willed, and

obstinate ; but peaceable, domestic, and fairly honest. Life and property are pro-

bably not safer in any part of Her Majesty's dominions than in Cyprus. Education

of all classes, clergy and laity, is of the lowest standard. Good elementary secular

education should be provided by the State.

In speaking of antiquities, special attention is called to the fine remains of
--

western mediaeval architecture in the churches of Nicosia and Faniagosta. These
merit a special memoir by a competent archaeologist. The fortifications of Fama-

gosta are probably one of the finest and best preserved examples of the military
Aengineering of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
                                                        colossal vase of compact

limestone, 11' 6" diameter, nearly 8 feet in height, -with sides 10 inches thick, is

seen on the summit of the hill which formed the citadel of the Phoenician city of

Amathus. There is a similar vase in the Louvre, also from Cyprus. The author

carefully examined vestiges of an ancient canal, which formerly served to connect

the salt lake south of Limasol with the sea.

The climate of Cyprus is next described, more especially with regard to the

fevers prevalent in some districts. The malarious fever is attributed chiefly to

emanations from marshes, which are, however, of limited area. To improve the

climate, especially about Famagosta, the marshes should be drained, and the river
Pidias embanked in the lower part of its course, and thus prevented from spreading

over and converting the plain into a swamp. The necessary works may be carried
out at moderate cost, and should prove remunerative by bringing land, now worse

than useless, into cultivation.

Agriculture is, with few exceptions, in a very backward and unsatisfactory

condition. Attempts at cultivation are only made in the case of the test lands, and

these produce but one corn crop every two or three years. The rainfall is often
insufficient, and the period at which rain falls, and the quantity, vary within wide
limits. During the past ten years there have been but five fairly good harvests.
Much of the water needed for the crops is carried off rapidly by torrents to the
sea. The remedy for these evils is to store water in tanks, after the Indian native

system, and distribute it over the land by canals as nepded. This supply of water

for n*rigation from tanks should be supplemented by artesian wells and an extension
of the method which has prevailed in Cyprus from an early age, of collecting water
from a series of shallow wells. Water is met with at moderate depths over the

greater part of the island. Irrigation, wherever employed (as it now is in many

districts on a small scale), is attended with the happiest results. The irrigated

lands produce a succession of abundant crops, and their value is at least five times

that of land of similar quality not irrigated.

     In conclusion, the author calls attention to the fact that no map exists of the
island with even an approximation to accuracy, and recommends, first, the com-

pletion of the trigonometrical survey which was commenced, but has been suspended;

secondly, a geological survey ; and thirdly, systematic meteorological observations,
the existing data as to rainfall being of the most meagre description.

                               TUESDAY, AUGUST 26.

     The following Papers were read :

   1. Hydrography, past and present. By Lieutenant G. Temple, R.N.

                                             See Reports, p. 229.

        2. Arctic Research. By Commander L. A. Beaumont, R.N.

     The author holds that the future of Arctic work must depend upon the
persevering efforts and reasonable arguments of those who advocate it ; and that
the revival of interest in Arctic exploration will commence amongst those who are
sure to be more influenced by valuable and substantial results as an object, than by

the prospect of a brilliant but profitless achievement.
     In spite of the unfortunate controversies which followed the return of the late
                                                                   go2

Arctic Expedition, the discovery of the unknown will never be permanently
abandoned, and the Arctic Regions, in common with the rest of the world, will
surely be discovered and explored. As regards the alleged risks and dangers, the
author asks why they should exercise a deterrent effect any more than the perils
and dangers of African or Australian travel. There will always be men ready to
o-o and in due time there will be sufficient support forthcoming to provide the

means. But it is desirable to utilize the experience of the present generation,
rather than wait until all experience must be obtained anew.

     On the east coast of Greenland and beyond Robeson Strait there is heavy ice
similar to that met with by MacOlure and Oollinson, and afterwards by Meahan

and McOlintock, along the coast of North America and adjacent islands, and when-

ever it occurs ship navigation entirely ceases, while the difficulty of sledge travelling

is immensely increased. It would seem that in all future work this sort of ice must
be reckoned upon ; and that no ship will ever get much beyond 82° north. In sledge
travelling it is indispensable that land should be near, and that the ice should he

fast, and there are few known points where these conditions can be obtained.
     Nevertheless, Commander Beaumont contended that there was nothing dis-

couraging in this ; nor need the work be confined to the highest latitudes, for where
scientific research and a practical school for future explorers are the objects, much

important work can be done in all parts of the unknown region. He anticipated a

 rich harvest of valuable results from the work of the present year. The Swedish

Expedition is already a great success, and those who know Captain Markham feel

 certain that his present cruise will bear good fruit.

      The author then addressed himself to the question of which route affords the

 best promise of geographical discovery, observing that geographical discovery will

 always embrace much that is valuable in many other branches of science. Franz

 Joseph Land seems, at first sight, to fulfil the conditions required to ensure success.
 Here the land extends far to the north, and if any part of the shore could be
 reached by a ship, a sledging party might certainly attain to the 86th parallel.
 But the disadvantages of the route are, that it is uncertain whether a vessel could

 reach the land, while there is no alternative after starting but to succeed or fail.
 If the main object is not gained, no lesser useful work can be done. The next

 route, in Commander Beaumont's opinion, now that the North-east passage has been
 achieved, is the exploration of the land about Cape Britannia, proceeding by way

--of Smith Sound : that is the discovery of the northern side of Greenland. He

 prefers this route to an attempt along the eastern side, because a higher latitude can
 be reached by Smith Sound ; and believes that a vessel might winter on the eastern
 shore of Robeson Strait, and advance depots to Repulse Harbour in the autumn.

 Commander Beaumont, who has seen Cape Britannia, the most northern known
 point of Greenland, believes that to stand on its highest peak would alone throw
 much light on Greenland geography. He then submitted calculations, derived from
 his own experience, of the time that it would take for a sledge party to reach

 Cape Britannia, and of the nature of the ice ; and offered several valuable sugges-
 tions for improved appliances in travelling over soft and deep snow.

      Commander Beaumont confidently predicts important geographical discoveries,
 and other useful scientific results for an Arctic Expedition despatched up Smith
 Sound with Cape Britannia and coasts beyond as its principal goal.

3. On the Interior of Greenland : the principal points of Geographical

     Interest connected with it, and the recent Expeditions for its Exploration.

    By Dr. H. Rink.

      This paper contains a sketch of the presumed physical conditions of the interior

of Greenland, as the best and largest existing illustration of the glacial epoch of

geologists which has had so much effect upon the surface of modern northern

Europe, and the only region where true icebergs can be observed in course of forma-

tion. Of this interior very little is actually known, the point reached by the expe-

dition mentioned in the present paper being the farthest hitherto attained. Even

of  the coast some 600 miles still remain  unknown                                                 but,  supposing it not to extend
                                                                                                ;
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  453

further northwards than is at present supposed, the whole coast line is 3,400 miles,
and its area 512,000 square miles, wholly covered with ice, except, perhaps, where

some barren highland may penetrate the glacial surface, and constantly engaged in

the formation of material for icebergs, which probably take one hundred years to
travel from the presumed central water-parting to the heads of the fjords where
they fall into the sea, but only at certain points. In one of these ice-fjords the
portion of glacier annually pushed in, and representing the annual surplus from an
extensive area, has been calculated to constitute a cubical body 900 feet high, two
miles long, and two miles broad.

     The investigation of the interior of this country, of especial interest to geo-
graphers as one in which the whole system of river drainage is represented by a
continuous sheet of ice, has since 1875 been taken in hand to some small extent by
the Danish Government, which has in 1876-78 annually voted 550^. for scientific
work there, mainly with the object of completing the coast-maps in connection
with the geological survey. In the course of these operations explorations were

extended over the border of the inland ice. In 1876 the geologist Steenstrup, with

Lieutenant Holm and Mr. Kornerup, travelled over the Julianshaab district,
between 60° and 61° N. lat. ; in 1877 the investigations were continued by him

and Lieutenant Jensen between 61° and 63° N. lat. ; and in 1878 the expedition
was divided, Jensen, Kornerup, and Mr. Groth exploring the coast between 62° 30'

and 64° 30' N. lat., and Steenstrup, who has not since been heard from, turning to

the more northern regions between 70° and 72° N.
      Lieutenant Jensen's party, in July 1878, crossed the inland ice in 62° 30' N., in

the endeavour to penetrate as far as possible into the interior. The object was to
reach certain iceless mountain-tops, called Nunataks, emerging in the distance from
the surface of the glacier, and which more than a century ago had been ascended
by a Danish trader. These were reached after a march of more than forty miles in a
straight line across the ice. On the lower of these Nunataks the roughness of the
surface of the ice was very great, being traversed by yawning chasms divided by steep
and slippery elevations, and cut by watercourses disappearing as cascades into the

crevasses. The party consisted of four, one of whom was a Greenlander, drawing
three small sledges, and generally tied together by a rope. After many perilous

adventures they reached the foot of the hills, the view from the summit of which

was obscured for a week by snow-storms and mist. On the weather clearing, a
successful ascent was made, the elevation being found to be 5,000 feet. The ice
waste of the interior was found to rise very slightly inwards, without visible inter-
ruption. In the present year Jensen, Kornerup, and Lieutenant Hammer have been

sent on a coast survey between 67° and 68° 30' N. lat., of which very little is known.

4. Indian Marine Surveys. By Clements R. S. Markham, C.B., F.B.S.,

                                             President of the Section.

    The Indian Navy created a splendid staff of surveyors, and many admirable
marine surveys were executed by them before the abolition of that useful service
in 1862. But from that time, during a period of twelve years, all marine surveys
on the coasts of India were absolutely stopped. Meanwhile trade increased, more
especially the coasting trade, and new ports were opened to facilitate the export of
coffee and other products. While the Government utterly neglected the duty of
making the approach to Indian coasts and harbours tolerably safe, the urgent need
for correct guides to navigation became each year more and more apparent.

     These facts were earnestly represented to the authorities both at home and in
India in 1871 and succeeding years, and at length the creation of a Marine Survey
Department was sanctioned, and Commander A. D. Taylor (late of the Indian
Navy) was appointed Superintendent. The work was commenced in October, 1875,
but no suitable vessels have yet been supplied, and the work has hitherto been done
by boat parties.

      Captain Taylor makes annual inspection tours, by which means he has discovered
many serious errors in existing charts, and has contributed largely to our knowledge
--454
                       eeport 1879.

of what is needed at the various ports around the coasts of India. Lieutenant

Jarrad, R.N., conducts the actual surveys ; and the construction of charts, the pub-

lication of notes to mariners, wreck returns, and lighthouse lists are entrusted to
AMr. Oarrington, the Chief Civil Assistant.
                                             new steamer, called the Investigator,

is now being built at Bombay, specially fitted for scientific surveying, and will be

Aready in 1880.  naturalist forms one of the staff of the Department ; and when

the new steamer is ready, and fitted with apparatus for deep sea sounding and

dredging, systematic scientific investigations will be undertaken. Useful results

have been produced by the Department in a wonderfully short time. From the

spring of 1875, when Mr. Carrington got his branch into working order, to 1879,

as many as eighty charts have been produced, or more than one each month, from
which 11,400 copies have been photo-zincographed. Upwards of 15,000 charts

have been corrected for new lights and buoys, and 20,000 copies of notices to
Amariners have been distributed.
                                  very great improvement has also been made in

Athe report of wrecks and casualties.  chart depot has been established at Calcutta,

where some 20,000 charts are shelved and numbered, and considerable sales are

now being effected. This is an immense benefit to the merchant shipping in Indian
ports, and the Department has also been able to supply H.M.'s ships when charts

were urgently needed.

The continued prosperity and efficiency of this useful Department is of the

utmost consequence to the shipping and manufacturing interests of nearly all the

maritime nations in the world, as well as to the people of  India                         and it  is  no  less
                                                                                       ;

important to geographers who are supplied with accurate hydrographic informa-

tion, and are thus enabled to obtain a sound knowledge of the physical geography

of the Indian coasts.

5. The Exploration of the American Isthmus and the Interoceanic Canal of

     Panama. By Lucien N. B. Wtse, Lieut.- Commr., French Navy.

     After some general observations upon the long recognised necessity of a connec-
tion of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Central America, and a discussion
of the various aspects of the subject, the author pointed out, among other con-

nected erroneous conclusions, a frequent error of opinion as to the practicability of

a canal in places where the sources of two rivers on opposite water-partings nearly
touch each other, and gave an account from personal experience of the natural diffi-
culties in the way of the explorer in this region. The badness of the climate,
however, except in marshy places on the coast, such as Greytown, he believes to
have been grossly exaggerated, Panama being considered by him to be the most
healthy of inter-tropical towns. There, the waters descend rapidly from great
heights ; the width of the Isthmus not exceeding 37 miles, and the water-parting
being only 10 miles distant. In Nicaragua, however, the physical contour is very
different, the elevation of the lake being so slight that the San Juan flowing from it
has only a fall of 107 feet in 124 miles, the least rise causing a flood, with marshes

extending for 74 miles. On leaving the hill region, the river breaks up into a count-

less net-work of streams, forming an immense marsh of hundreds of square miles,
with proportionately bad climatic conditions. Darien, hitherto considered most un-
healthy, has been found by the American expeditions to be nothing of the kind,,
subject to simple medical precautions. From a hygienic point of view, therefore,,
Nicaragua is the worst of the three great divisions of routes ; and, though all are
productive in wood suited for hydraulic purposes, Darien is the most so.

    As to the supply of labour, the population is scanty and indolent throughout,
though more numerous at Panama. The Indian will not bear regular work ; he is
timid, and will give way to the spread of civilisation. The chief supply must be

from Asia, but negroes will be useful in cutting roads, at which they are very

expert ; and they may be bought for purposes of liberation at a cheap rate by law
of the Spanish Antilles and Brazil, their freedom being made the ultimate reward

of their labour.

     Of the routes proposed, that of Tehuantepec is the first from the north. Capt.
Shufeldt, of the U.S. Navy, after examining the river Coatzacoalcos, found it at a
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  455

distance of 120 miles from the great oceans to be small and shallow, necessitating
144 miles of canal and 140 locks. It has no port on the Pacific, and not a good
one on the Atlantic side.

     The Honduras route is no better, from the extent of its mountainous tract and
the distance (93 miles) between the two oceans.

     In Nicaragua the mountains disappear, and the lake is only 36 feet above sea
level, but a canal would require projecting jetties at each end, especially on the
Atlantic side. The badness of the climatic conditions has been above mentioned,

and dredging to keep down the deposits of mud and sand would require to be

unceasingly carried on.

     Of the Darien routes, that by the Atrato is very attractive. Large steamers
can ascend it for 1 56 miles, and it has a wide delta, the most favourable com-
mencement for a canal being at the mouth of the Uraba. Obstacles to its naviga-
tion require, however, to be removed. The Tuyra has a less volume of water, but
its mouth is very suited for a great international harbour, the climate being healthy
and anchorage good. Extensive surveys of these routes have been made, that by
Commander Selfridge being the most conspicuous. The Isthmus is narrowest here
between the Atlantic and the navigable waters of the Bayano, being only 30 miles
wide, but the mountains are narrow and very precipitous. Selfridge 's proposed
canal follows the Atrato and Napipi, passes the Cordillera by a tunnel, and ends in
the bay of Cupica ; it obtained the second place at the recent Congress. The
lecturer's own Darien expedition of 1876-77 was severely tried by the death of
Captain Bixio, the Engineer Brooks, and Musso. Engineering explorations were,
however, continued on the Cue and Caquiri rivers; the plateau of Cana was ex-
plored as far as Tiati, where an important discovery of a low valley was made.
The work was connected with that of the Americans, and a canal planned, which,
starting from the bay of San Miguel, was projected to fall into the Atrato. Three
hundred and sixty miles of forest and river bank were levelled during this survey.

An alternative route was to follow the Tuyra to below the island of Piriaque, join

the Chucunaque, utilise the Tupica valley, and passing to the south-east of the
Peak of Gandi, reach the Atlantic by the valleys of Tola and the Acanti. In the
following year the Bayano was explored, and the line from San Miguel to Acanti
determined. The line by Gandi has great advantages ; its tunnel is long, but the

rock is not hard, and the space is short between the Pacific and the confluence of
the Chucunaque and Tuyra. The total cost would not greatly exceed 375,000/.

     The Panama route, selected almost unanimously at the recent International
Congress at Paris, with M. Lesseps as President, is the only one on which a level

uncovered canal is possible. It requires a cutting of 262 feet in height, therefore
a tunnel is more economical. This would be from 5| to 9i miles long, i.e., not
longer than the St. Gothard. Volcanoes are extinct or dormant on this line, and
no earthquakes are felt.

     The route is from Panama to the Bay of Colon by way of the valleys of Chagres

and the Rio Grande, and practically follows a road which has been in use since
1532. The elevations of the rail already existing are not great, but the sinuosities
are frequent and curves sharp, and the rock to be penetrated in tunnelling is hard.
But this route has the advantage of being short, on one level, and near a railway,
with consequent facilities of transport ; of not requiring delicate works rendering

constant repair necessary ; and of possessing on the Atlantic side a perfect port in

the Bay of Limon, and on the Pacific one not requiring important works, and
with a generally calm sea. The tunnel required is short, and can even be dispensed
with if absolutely necessary ; if made, there is a possibility of multiplying wells
for its perforation. Although not geographically connected with this project, it
may be observed that a convention has been agreed upon between the lecturer and
the railroad company, permitting and aiding the proposed canal. The cost of

this plan is estimated at 32,500,000/.

                  6. On Geographical Studies and Works in Italy.
                             By Professor G. Dalla Vedova.

   --In Italy, the aids to Geographical knowledge may be thus divided :

      State Undertakings. The general topographical survey of the kingdom,
commenced at the end of 1861, under the general staff of the Italian army, and
subsequently carried on by a special office, the Royal Military Topographical Insti-

tute at Florence. In 1873, the ex-kingdom of the Two Sicilies was completely

triangulated, with other partially geodetic works elsewhere ; and since that time
the general triangulation of Italy has been undertaken, commencing with Piedmont,

with other topographical works to be utilised in the preparation of a map of Italy
on the scale of 1 : 100-000, though frequently themselves on a much larger scale.

In the present year, 1st and 2nd class surveys are being executed in Piedmont,
Lombardy, from Leghorn to Oivita Vecchia, in Sardinia, and elsewhere, and are
expected to be completed in three years. Operations have also been conducted in
aid of the determination of the European level. The Institute also published in

1878 a complete map in photolithography of the province of Naples and Sicily, 174

sheets, scale 1 : 50-000, with elevation in contour lines of 10-metre intervals.

Work has also been executed towards the publication of a large map of Italy in

photogravure, bv Ayet's process, to be completed in 277 sheets, scale 1 : 100-000.
Twelve sheets of this have been completed in proof.

     As to Hydrographic Surveys, under the Minister of Marine, the whole Adriatic

coast is completed, with extension in 1877 to Calabria and Sicily, and in 1878

to North Sardinia. Sixteen sheets (with many others provisionally) have been

published of a coast map, scale 1 : 100-000.

     The Minister of Public Works has in hand the river hydrography, high roads,

and railways, on which memoirs are published in the ' Hydrographic Bulletin.' He

presented a general account to the Paris Exposition.

     The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, apart from economical statistics,
undertakes Meteorology, having a council and thirty-two observatories in his de-
partment, and also a geological committee (with Commissioner Felice Giordano as
president). The ' Italian Statistical Annual,' under this minister, edited by Com-
missioner Luigi Bodio, contains condensed results of official information on internal
geography and statistics.

      In all the schools, geography forms part of the curriculum, though in unequal
degrees. It is relatively larger in the elementary, very limited in the lower, and

                                               ^

entirely insufficient in the higher classical schools. There are special teachers in
only seven of the twenty-three State and private University Institutions, viz., at

Bologna, Florence, Naples, Padua, Pavia, Rome, and Turin, and in all these the
time and course of instruction devoted to geography are inadequate.

     As to State aid in explorations by foreigners, although never organising such

expeditions, Italy has always been ready to contribute substantial and moral sup-
port for the advantage of science or the benefit of her subjects.

     Private Institutions.--Chief of these is the Italian Geographical Society,
founded at Florence in 1867 by Commander Cristoforo Negri, who continued

President until 1871, when the Society was transferred to Rome. He was suc-
ceeded by Commander Cesare Correnti, who held office until January last, when
Don Onorato Caetani, Prince of Teano, was elected. The Society now has over

1,400 Fellows, and publishes an 'Annual Bulletin ' of 800 pages, with twelve maps,
of which 15 vols, had appeared in 1878. It has also published a volume of
'Memoirs' (1878), one of 'Biographical and Bibliographical Studies on Italian
Geography,' and another on the ' Physical and Political Geography of Italy ' (1875).
It has promoted or subsidised various expeditions to the Bogos country, Abyssinia,

New Guinea, Morocco, &c. It delivers lectures, gold medals (the last two to

D'Albertis and Savorgnan di Brazza), and two pecuniary awards, endowed by the
present King and Commissioner Canevaro.

     The Turin Geographical Club, founded some years before the Society by Pro-
fessor C. Peroglio, and of which Signor Guido Cora is now President, has issued
some few publications, but is not of any considerable size.

    The Italian Alpine Club, with its centre at Turin, presided over by Comman-
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                                                                                                        457

der Q. Sella, is now extended all over the kingdom by local sections, chiefly

owing to the exertions of Mr. R. E. Budden. It publishes a Bulletin.

The section for Commercial Geography of the Geographical Society, originated

by Count Telfener, has not as yet found any definite object.

The Milanese Society for African Commercial Exploration, founded in 1878,

with Commander Negri as honorary, and Commander C. Erba as acting Presi-

dent, has already started an expedition under Dr. Matteucci, and has invited

Piaggia to undertake another, for pearl explorations on the Gualima.

Of Geographical periodicals, Italy has ' L'Esploratore ' (Milan), ' Cosmos,' edited

by Guido Cora at Turin, the ' Geological Bulletin.' ' Consular Bulletin,' and the

' Giro del Mondo ' (Milan). Of other publications, the account by Professor Giglioli

of the ' Voyage of the Magenta,' and the first volume of the account of the ' Travels

on the Blue Nile,' by the Missionary Beltrame, are specialised.

In Cartography, the chief  progress  has  been  made      in scholastic maps                                                                                      a large

a globe and set of wall-maps of considerable excellence.

7. Italian Explorers in New Guinea. By Professor Giglioli.

Much scientific work in New Guinea has been done by Italian explorers, while

a very great deal still remains to be done, the high chain of mountains running

through the length of this great island being yet quite unknown. Professor Giglioli,

of Florence, in this paper, gave some account of the labours of Italians in this field

of research. The first Italian who ever visited New Guinea was the Count Carlo

Vidua di Conzano, in 1830, who went to Triton Bay in a Dutch vessel. In 1869-70

Colonel G. di Lenna, a distinguished military officer, and G. Emilio Cerruti reached

the south-west coast of Papua, but were treacherously attacked by the natives on

Athe north side of MacCluer Bay.  survey was made by them of Galewo Straits.

Dr. Odoardo Beccari and L. M. D'Albertis, in 1872, reached an island in Galewo

Straits, whence they made excursions to the mainland of New Guinea. They after-

wards explored the Arfak mountains, the home of the birds of paradise; but

D'Albertis was attacked with fever and obliged to retire to Sydney. Meanwhile

Beccari visited the Aru and Kei Islands. In New Guinea the travellers made very

important botanical and zoological collections, including a new bird of paradise. In

1875 Dr. Beccari started on his second visit to New Guinea, with generous aid from

the town and provincial councils of Genoa. Hiring a schooner at Amboyna, he landed

at Dorei-Hain, ascended Mount Morait to a height of 3,500 feet, and obtained a

view of the largest river in the northern peninsula of New Guinea. He afterwards

reached its banks, and found that it flowed from the Arfak mountains to the north-

west coast. Beccari then explored the whole curve of the wide Geelvink Bay, and

visited the islands in it. He also again visited the Arfak mountains, attaining a

height of 7,000 feet, and ascertained that the highest peaks reached 9,500 feet.

He returned with immense natural history collections. Signor Albertis, after a
long stay in Australia, set out on a second expedition to New Guinea in 1875,

intending to visit the south coast, and to penetrate into the interior by one of the

large rivers. He was accompanied by a young Genoese, named Tommasinelli. They

reached Yule Island, whence they made several excursions ; but afterwards endured
much from sickness and want of food, and Tommasinelli was obliged to return

home. After again visiting Australia, D'Albertis joined the English missionaries,

Macfarlane and Stone, to make an expedition up the unknown Fly river. That

river was ascended for 150 miles. Returning to Sydney, he met with liberal support,

and was provided with a steam launch. In this small craft he re-entered the Fly

river in May 1876, and ascended it for about 500 miles, planting his flag nearly in
the centre of New Guinea. In 1877 he once more entered the Fly liver, but the
natives had become hostile, and after encountering great dangers he reached Mount

Ernest Island in Torres Straits, on January 1, 1878, having been deserted by all

his crew, except the English engineer and a boy. He made veiy large botanical,

zoological, and ethnological collections, which are of great value. The Italian

explorers in New Guinea have brought home about 5,000 specimens of plants,

nearly 100,000 of animals, of which 10,000 birds and 80,000 insects have been

deposited by Beccari and D'Albertis in the museums of Genoa and Florence.

The following Papers and Report were read

1. The Scientific Societies in relation to the Advancement of Science in

      the United Kingdom. By Professor Leone Levi, F.S.A., F.S.S.,

       F.R.G.S., Doctor of Economic Science, and of Lincoln's Inn, Barrister-

        at-Law.

At the meeting of the British Association at Norwich in 1868, 1 bad the honour

of laying before this Section a paper on the progress of learned societies, illustrative
of the advancement of science in the United Kingdom. The importance of the

subject, and the renewed effort to rear a building in the metropolis for several

scientific societies, now but insufficiently accommodated, have induced me to submit

to this Section another communication on the number and resources of such

scientific societies at this moment, and therewith on the improved condition of

science.

     The relation of our learned societies to scientific progress is close and intimate.

Men of science are not now, as they once were, secluded from human society;

they live in our crowded cities ; they frequent our centres of manufacture and

commerce                                                   they cluster together ;  they unite for scientific  researches ;  they pursue
                                                        ;

their studies in the open day. No air of mystery, no jealousy or secrecy, surrounds

their movements. The discoveries they make find a ready vent at our scientific

Asocieties.                                                communication at the Royal Society constitutes an era in physical

science. It was at the Society of Antiquaries that Dr. Schliemann laid bare the

wonders of Homeric Troy ; it was at the Royal Geographical Society that Livingstone
related his discoveries in Africa, and Captain Sir George Nares his adventures in

the Arctic exploration ; it was at the Institute of Civil Engineers that Mr. Bidder

expounded                                                  the  system  of  mental  calculation,  in which  he  was  so  distinguished
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and it was at the Society of Arts that Professor Bell explained his discovery of

the telephone, and Mr. Priestley endeavoured to popularise the principles of the

electric light. Happy moments that Newton and Faraday, and the host of past

and present workers on the golden soil of science and philosophy, were and are able

to spend in the rooms of our scientific societies ! Read their transactions for any
one year, and see how brimfull they are of precious seeds of human advancement

   We have reason to be thankful for the advancement of science. If by science

we mean a clear and certain knowledge of anything- founded on self-evident prin-

ciples or demonstration, little progress, I fear, can be expected, because necessary

or mathematical truths are limited in number, and because we live under conditions

that we can but seldom have any clear or certain notice of things capable of

producing absolute conviction. But if we use the word ' science ' for a formed

system of any branch of knowledge, for knowledge generalised, systematised, and

verified, comprehending the doctrine, reason, and theory of the thing, with or

without any immediate application of it to any use or office of life, then we may

Wesay science is making immenee progress.  certainly know more than ever we

did of the physical property of things, and their operations. Many things which

were formerly known but vaguely and loosely are now known more fully and com-

pletely. Much of what was, at best, a guess or a supposition, is now founded on

experimental knowledge. There has been both a large accumulation of facts and

Wea clear discerning of their relation one to another.   have fathomed Nature

more closely, discovered more of her powers, and utilised more of her forces. What

problems in mathematics and algebra have been solved, and how happily have their

--principles been applied to the science of life to mechanics, navigation, and astro-

nomy ! What advance in medical science, especially in hygiene, pathology, and
surgery ! What advancement in scientific instruments, as revealed in our late
exhibition at South Kensington ! What revolutions in our knowledge of geology,
mineralogy, and biology ! And how much have the philosophical sciences, espe-

cially of politics and social economy, become extended and methodised ! Science

has truly made, and is making, constant progress, and we have abundant proof of

it in the multiplication of our scientific societies, in the greater reverence paid to

science, and in the greater activities of its votaries.

     In the seventeenth century there were only two scientific societies in the United

--Kingdom the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. In olden time the

Universities were the sole centres and propagators of science. The eighteenth

century saw the establishment of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Eoyal Irish

Academy, the Linnasan Society, the Koyal Institution, and the Society of Arts.

But the nineteenth century has been very prolific in the formation of scientific

societies. As each science expanded, its cultivators became more numerous, and

they soon saw the advantage of uniting in their labours, publishing their trans-

actions, and forming themselves into groups and distinct societies. At this present

moment London, the metropolis of science, possesses upwards of forty to fifty

scientific societies, and the calendar for the season exhibits an amount of activity

quite unknown in former periods. And it is the more remarkable in this age,

often described as wholly given to the ignoble occupation of money-making, that all

the labour thus performed by men of science in England, Scotland, and Ireland,

year by year, is the spontaneous offering of time and learning of men, in most cases

far from affluent, to the great cause of human and scientific progress.

First and foremost among our scientific societies are the three Royal Societies, one

in England, one in Scotland, and one in Ireland. Though the primary objects of the

Royal Society of London are the promotion of mathematical and physical science, it

has for a considerable time achieved the distinction of having among its members some

of the most distinguished men from all branches of science. The Royal Society differs

from the French Institute and other foreign academies principally in the fact that it

is not divided, like them, into sections, and its members are not paid by the State.

--The Institute of France, in its five divisions the Acad^mie Francaise, Acad^mie

des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, des Sciences, des Beaux Arts, and Sciences

--Morales et Politiques has 226 members, 36 free academicians, 32 foreign members,

and 236 foreign correspondents. The Royal Prussian Academy of Science, in its

-- --two divisions the Physico-Mathematical and Philosophic-Historical has 44

ordinary members, 16 foreign members, 11 honorary members, and 175 correspond-

ing members. Other Royal Academies have fewer members. The Imperial

Academy of Science of St. Petersburg is composed of 15 professors, besides the

president and directors. The Royal Academy of Science of Turin consists of 40

members resident in Turin, 20 non-resident, and 20 foreign members. The Royal

Society of London has now 549 members. Since the passing of the law, in 1847,

restricting the yearly elections to 15 members, the number of Fellows has gradu-
ally become smaller. The Royal Society of Edinburgh has now 428 members,
and the Royal Irish Academy 328 members, making altogether 1,805 members.

     In comparison with the return given in 1868, the number of members of the
three leading Societies was as follows, showing a decrease of 4 per cent.:

Statistical Society is certainly not only to bring together those facts which are
calculated to illustrate the condition and prospects of society, but to show how, by

the scientific collocation and classification of facts, the student may draw results

and lessons of the highest importance, especially to the economist and politician.
The Statistical Society numbers now 746 members ; there is also an active Statistical
Society in Manchester, with 178 members, making in all 024 members. 1 Altogether
the Societies for the propagation of physical and mathematical sciences exhibit the

bers ; besides the Society of Naval Architects and Telegraph Engineers. More
allied to art than to science is the Royal Institute of British Architects, for the
.advancement of civil architecture, which has now 820 fellows and associates.
There is the Society of Arts, ever active, promoting inventions, discoveries, and
other matters connected with the arts, manufactures, and commerce, having
also an Indian section, an African section, and a Chemical section for the discus-
sion of subjects connected with practical chemistry and its application to the arts
and manufactures. The society has now 3,686 members. The Pharmaceutical
Society, for the purpose of advancing chemistry and pharmacy, has 4,536 members
and associates ; the Institute of Actuaries, for the extension and improvement of
the data and methods of the science which has its origin in the application of the
Doctrine of Probabilities to the affairs of life, and from which the practice of life
insurance and the valuation of reversionary interests, deferred annuities, &c, derive
their principles of operation. The Institute has now 362 fellows and associates.

And of the same character are the Clinical Society, with 336 members; the

Obstetrical Society, with 738 members ; the Pathological Society, with 601
members ; and the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, with 666 members.

and conflicting hypotheses, and thus promote the real advancement of true science.

This Society, now in the thirteenth year of its existence, counts 744 members.

The numerical progress of the scientific societies during the last forty years

has heen by no means uniform. In some cases a law is in force for the very purpose

of restricting the membership. Thus the Royal Society, which in 1846 had 841

fellows in 1878 had only 549 fellows. The Society of Antiquaries, under a similar

law, had 867 fellows in 1831, and in 1878 only 600. Other societies, however,

have no limit to their membership, and are capable of great expansion. The
dano-er, indeed, is that in the eagerness to increase their number due care may

not°be taken to elect only persons sufficiently conversant with the different

sciences. There has always existed considerable difference in the character of

several of our scientific societies. In some cases they consist exclusively of men

of science ; in others they comprise many simply interested in the progress of

certain sciences ; in others, again, they are purely composed of professional men.

The Society of Arts, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Botanic Society,

and the like, are mixed societies, the scientific element being represented in them

in more or less proportion. The Institute of Civil Engineers, the Pharmaceutical

Society, are composed of professional men. In the interest of the advancement

of science, it is undesirable to close the door of entrance too tightly to these

societies, and thus lose the means which a large membership places at their dis-

posal for increasing usefulness.  I venture to suggest that fellowship in such
                                                                                                            _

societies, and the honour of using their initials, should always be reserved

for men of science ; but that an unlimited number be admitted as members or

associates.

     Taken at four intervals of ten years, the number of members of the principal

societies was as follows :

     Assuming that these societies fairly represent the number of persons in the
United Kingdom conversant with and interested in the respective branches of
science, the following proportion of each to one million of the population is

interesting :

of their communications ; others publish thern in full, together with the discussion
which ensued after the papers were read. For non-resident and busy members
the full and early publication of memoirs is of the utmost importance.

     It is not to be desired that our scientific societies should be subsidised by the
State, but the claim of science to State assistance has been fully recognised, and we

may well demand that whatever amount is so devoted be fairly distributed among

all the branches of science. In the case of house accommodation it is difficult to

see on what ground many of our best and most useful societies are excluded from

the boon of free rental. When recently, on the recommendation of the Royal

Commission on Scientific Instruction; the State resolved to vote 4,0001. annually
to aid research, the societies whose presidents were to be taken in consultation
were named as the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh and the Royal Irish
Academy, the Royal Astronomical, the Mathematical, Chemical, Linnsean, Zoolo-
gical, Geological, and Physical Societies, the Institutes of Civil Engineers and
Mechanical Engineers, the General Council of Medical Education, the Royal Colleges
of Physicians and Surgeons, and the British Association. Several important
societies were thereby not recognised.

     The amount voted by the State yearly for education, science, and art appears
large, and constitutes a somewhat greater percentage on the total national expen-
diture than in former years, as may be seen from the following figures :

British Museum, 110,949/., for the South Kensington Museum, for scientific research,

and for schools of science cannot he classified with any precision. It is easy to see,
however, that Government aid is principally given to physical and natural science,

leaving a wide range of scientific exploration altogether unassisted.

Great have been the achievements of science in modern times, and England

owes to its cultivators a profound debt of gratitude. Our manufactures and in-

dustry, our productive power and means of locomotion, all depend for their develop-
ment on the advance of science, and our scientific societies have a high economic
value. The Eoyal and Mathematical Societies are labouring to evolve the prin-

ciples of those sciences which govern the phenomena of the material universe and

the practical problems of the Law of Probabilities. The Statistical Society subjects

the real worth of economic doctrine to the close test of numbers, the great corrective

of experience, using the inductive rather than the deductive method in its researches

for the guidance of the philosopher and statesman. The Royal Astronomical Society is

expanding our knowledge of the meteorology and magnetism of the universe, as

well as of the laws which govern the motion of the heavenly bodies, to the immense

benefit of navigation. The Chemical Society is analysing matter, finding out new

elements, and enriching the world with the knowledge of their capabilities. The Geo-

logical Society maps out for us the very strata of the earth. The Royal Geographical

                          3. Apprenticeship Schools in France.

           By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc, 8fc.

The system of apprenticeship, as it has existed in England and on the Con-

tinent, is falling into decay from social causes, which render the education of the
apprentice at the hands of his master impracticable. The question of apprentice-

--Howship is one of the knotty points of technical education, and involves the following
problem :  to give to artizan children (in the skilled industries) that technical

training and scientific knowledge which their occupation demands, without detain-
ing them so long at their schooling as to give them a distaste for manual labour.

     Four distinct solutions of this problem are possible :

1st. Send the children to work in the factory or workshop before their primary

education is completed, making it obligatory all through their apprenticeship that
they shall have every day a certain number of hours' schooling in a school in the

workshop, or attached to it.

2nd. Keep the children at school as long as their education is unfinished, but

set up a xcorhshop in the school, where they shall pass a certain amount of time

every day, so as to gain at least an aptitude for manual labour.

     3rd. Organize a school and a workshop side by side, and co-ordinate the hours
given to study with an equal number of hours devoted to systematic manual labour.

     4th. Send the children half the day to the existing schools, and the other half
to work half-time in the workshop or factory.

Illustrations of all these systems are to be found in Paris.

     Of the first type there are no fewer than 237 in France, of which the schools of

M. Lemaire and of MM. Ohaix (in Paris) may be taken as excellent examples.

     Of the second type of apprenticeship school is the Ecole Oommunale d'Ap-
prentis, in the Rue Tournefort, Paris. This is an ordinary elementary school,

having workshops attached to it, and used for about three hours a day by the lads.
     The third type,^ which is par excellence the apprenticeship school, is well

illustrated by the Ecole Municipale d'Apprentis of the Boulevard de La Villette,

Paris, and by the Ecoles d'Horologerie of Besancon and of Cluses. Statistical

tables were given of the attendance at these schools, of the education given, of the

--capital and current expenditure per pupil, and of the results attained.
     Fourth type. Half-time schools are rare, and not very important in their

results.

The author conceives that there is room for schools of all these different types

to exist side by side in all large manufacturing centres, though schools of the first
and third types are probably best suited to the conditions of British industry.

     The author claims to have established, by facts drawn from the experience of

the French schools,

1st. That the systematic instruction of apprentices in the skilled industries is

possible.

2nd. That it can be effected in several different ways.

     3rd. That apprenticeship schools of one or other type afford a most satisfactory

and economically sound way of attaining this result.
    4th. That this New Apprenticeship solves the knotty problem of technical

education which arose out of the decay of the Old Apprenticeship.

      4. On Credit as an Asset of a State. By Hyde Clarke, V.P.S.S.

     The purpose of the author was to show, in illustration of his previous paper,

'' On the Loans of Sovereign States,' that independently of all material natural
resources and of capital, a State may possess credit, which will supply capital, and

is to be reckoned as an asset. Taking a colony as an example, he pointed out that the
natural resources, land, pasturage, harbours, water-power, rivers, forests, mines,
     --

470  REPORT 1879.

were, without the application of capital and labour, of simply nominal value. All
the resources of such a State are applied to production, and transport is a condition
without which production can merely supply local food, without producing ex-

changeable commodities. With the development of the means of transport by
railways, new communities are no longer in a position to be self-sufficing in com-

munications, and are dependent on the supply of external capital for rails, machinery,
and works. These must be furnished by credit, and where credit cannot be ob-
tained the country must remain undeveloped. This resource of credit has been

unduly neglected in many States of the American Union, and in those of Central
and South America. To ascertain the statistical value of this credit, he took the
amount expended by the State, by municipalities, and by companies on public works,
supplementing this by a further sum where the credit was unexhausted. Thus, Mr.

Clarke estimated the minimum credit of Canada at 50,000,000/., of New SouthWales

at 30,000,000/., of Victoria at 30,000,000/., of South Australia at 15,000,000/., of
Queensland at 20,000,000/., of Tasmania at 5,000,000/., of Natal at 4,000,000/.

At zero, he estimated Bolivia, Costa Bica, Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Hayti, Hon-
duras, Mexico, Persia, Peru, San Domingo, Venezuela. The cultivation and main-

tenance of credit he urged as an essential provision in the administration of a

State, and as an immense resource. He contrasted England, the United States,

Germany, and France, with Russia and China.

        1. On the Decay m the Export Trade of tjie United Kingdom.

                                  By S. Bourne, F.S.S.

     The question whether the diminution in the value of the exports of British and
Irish produce and manufacture, which has undoubtedly taken_ place in recent years,
is solely one of price and not in quantity, has given rise to considerable discussion.
The Prime Minister, in his place in Parliament, has, on the authority of a

--report from the head of the Statistical Department of the Board of Trade in
--which the trade of 1877 was compared with that of 1873 taken comfort from

the thought that had the prices of 1873 been realised in the valuation of 1877,
the two years would only have differed by a million of money instead of the
apparent difference of forty-five millions, and most of the leadiug political
economists have adopted the same view for other years. Yet there is reason to

--doubt whether the decay has not been to a great extent in volume as well as

value in quantity as well as price.

     There is no difficulty in determining to which cause this is owing in the case of

any single article of which we possess records, of both quantity and value ; but

where some have increased and others decreased it is only by analysing the
returns, assigning to each item its relative proportion, and combining the results,
that it can be ascertained to which or in what degree the preponderance of either
cause is on the whole to be awarded. Tables are compiled for the seven principal
articles of export, viz. : Cotton, jute, linen and woollen manufactures, coal, copper,

--and iron, contrasting the several periods 1877 with 1873, 1878 with 1872, and
--the first six months of 1879 with 1872 bringing out the followins; results.

     These figures, however, fail to represent the true state of the case. In 1872-3
the price of coals was unduly inflated, and so of all articles in the manufacture of
which coal is largely consumed. The valuations, therefore, for these earlier years

require to be brought down to the average prices of previous and subsequent years.

Again, a large portion of the value of the exports is to be found in the cost of the
foreign materials of which they are composed, and the variations in the prices of
these for the respective years needs to be estimated and allowed for. Dealing thus
with coal, iron, and cotton, the above figures are thus reduced in every particular
save that of loss in quantity, and will stand thus :

The average price of wheat in the years 1863, 1864, and 1865 was 4s. 2d. below

the average of 1878, whilst that of barley was 10s. per quarter lower in these years

than in 1878, and for the said years 1863, 1864, and 1865 oats were 3s. Id. per

quarter below the year 1878.  Meat  averaged  about  three  farthings  per  lb more            in

1865 than in 1868, and Id. more in 1878 than in 1868. As no nation can allow

its population to perish of hunger, or to suffer the terrible evils of and following

upon scarcity and famine, it is an evident necessity to attend to these statistics.

From September 1, 1878, to the last week in July 1879, viz., ten months,

the import of cereal produce was 102,747,256 cwts., of the declared value of

41,256,3562. Our exports were 2,286,869 cwts. in the ten months.

The tenant farmers of the United Kingdom are about 1,000,000, employing a

capital of or about 400,000,000/. sterling. "With security on judicious outlay it

might be increased to five or six hundred millions, when they might farm at a

profit instead of a loss, as we are continually told many are doing at present.

Peru was formerly the foremost as regards agricultural statistics, to its great

advantage, and now our own magnificent Australian Colonies are pre-eminent for

their elaborate and minute agricultural statistics. In all probability had a good

-- --system of that sort been established in India at a former period, the entire cost of

the two famines 17,000,0002. sterling might have been saved.

The importance of the subject of this paper is recognised by the mercantile

and shipping interests as well as by that powerful engine and interest the press,

and it was observed by the chairman at the meeting of the Royal Agricultural So-

ciety in December, 1877, that the earlier publication of our agricultural statistics

was due to the papers read thereon before the British Association ; and on May 22,

1879, at the meeting of the same Society, a prominent member advocated the ob-

taining, at any cost, by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, statistics of the

agricultural produce of every clime and country in the known world, as essential to

the interests of manufactures, commerce, shipping, and agriculture.

The fear of advance in rent, from these returns, is becoming less as knowledge

advances.

     Long and equitable leases, i.e., security of tenure, will materially assist the
onward improvement in agriculture, which, with compensation for all unexhausted
improvements, will attract and bring more men of skill, capital, and enterprise into
agriculture, and we shall then cease to hear the farmer calling for Parliamentary
assistance, to which we must add that the game should be under the control of the
tenant. With those equitable adjustments, the farmer need not fear foreign or colo-
nial competition or prices. Moreover, as we have seen greater depression many

times before, so when the other great industries revive agriculture will also

improve.

3. The ' German ' Speech and Lip Reading System of Teaching the Deaf.
                                 By David Buxton, Ph.D.

The number of those who are deprived of hearing, though relatively small, is

larger than is commonly supposed, and quite large enough to form a very important

item in that world of humanity with which science, and philanthropy taught and

directed by science, have to deal.. In the various populations of the world the

deaf are probably not less in number than a million of souls ; the distribution of

this number is very unequal, no doubt, and varies not only in different countries

but in different districts of the same country, as in our own for example, some

counties in England showing twice and even three times as many deaf persons to

the general population as are to be found in other counties not far distant. In

the whole of Great Britain and Ireland at the census of 1871, the number of per-

sons returned as ' deaf and dumb ' was 19,237, being a proportion to the whole

population of one in 1644, the local differences ranging from one in 1972 for

England and Wales, to one in 975 for Ireland. In April 1881 the next enumera-

tion of the people will take place. Many striking facts of recent occurrence have

led thoughtful observers to the conclusion that our deaf population will then

exhibit a considerable increase ; that it will reach as high a figure as 30,000.

The ' German ' system of teaching the deaf is the only one which invokes science

and applies science in its operations. That England does stand far in the rear of

most other countries in respect of the teaching of her deaf children is as true as

it is humiliating. She does not teach so many and she does not teach so well.

The number of deaf children of the school age is always reckoned as sixteen per

cent, of the whole deaf population. This on the census of 1871 would give us nearly

3200 as the number who should have been at school ; the best calculation I was
able to make showed that the actual number was under 2000. In July 1877 (ac-

cording to the 'Organ,' a periodical devoted to the special subject), the institutions

and schools for the ' deaf and dumb ' in Germany numbered forty-nine, and contained

2932 pupils, under the instruction of 288 teachers, giving an average of 10T8

pupils to each teacher. The increase in the number of institutions within the

previous two years had been nine, of pupils 682, of teachers 118. Probably,

no other country can show equal progress during the same period. In 1872,

the Swiss schools contained 344 deaf pupils, under the instruction of thirty-

seven teachers : an average of nine to a teacher. What is the case in the institu-

Ations of Great Britain ?  table compiled in 1877 gives 2340 pupils and a total of

171 instructors, including pupil teachers and deaf persons promoted out of the school

to take the charge of classes. The number of these latter is thirty-three, and the

number of female teachers, including fifteen nuns engaged at St. Mary's, Dublin,

sixty-eight. This gives an average of fourteen to one teacher, the German average

being 10T8, and the Swiss only nine per teacher. Thus, on the mere ground of

numbers, we compare very unfavourably, but when we reflect upon the materials of

which the teaching staff in England is so largely composed, it is no wonder that

the subject is one which, in the minds of all who are interested in the welfare of
the deaf, has for a long time created the deepest anxiety. Few of those who are

engaged in teaching have entered upon the work with any special qualifications for

it, none have been trained to it, and a very large proportion tire of it before they
have acquired sufficient experience to make their teaching of any value. The

superiority of the ' German ' system nobody questions. Its bitterest opponents do

not deny that ; they only say, in effect, that the other is good enough for its pur-

pose, that it is cheaper, and that in some cases where the time and capacity of the

learner are limited, the ' German ' method is inapplicable. But is this great country

content to be put off with an inferior system in the matter of education to that

which poorer countries are determined to have and willing to pay for ? Germany

is poor, especially Prussia proper. Switzerland is not rich, nor is Italy, nor Hol-

land, in comparison with ourselves. Yet all these countries afford to support

almost universally the ' German ' system, which it has been alleged is so expensive
as compared with the French. But is it a fact that the ' German ' system requires
----

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.          475

a larger staff of teachers than the other system ? The best French teachers will
not tell you so. Probably under any system eleven pupils are as many as any one
teacher should be expected to attend to. But even if the better system is somewhat

more expensive to work, surely, even in a commercial sense, it is worth the money.

         1. Elementary Natural Science in the Board Schools of London.

  By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S., Member of the London School Board.

     In elementary schools a knowledge of the facts of nature is generally given in
two very different ways. In the Infant department there usually linger some
remnants of that instruction by object lessons which was considered a valuable
part of education before the Revised Code of 1861. In the higher standards of the

Boys' and Girls' departments certain sciences may he taught as ' specific subjects,'

and receive encouragement by a Government grant.
     The London School Board has all along desired that this knowledge of nature

should not be confined to the least and the moat advanced scholars, but should be ex-
tended throughout the whole course of a child's school life. It covers the walls of
its schools with natural history pictures, and other diagrams, it gives a preference
to teachers holding science certificates, it publishes fidl instructions to the teachers in
regard to object lessons, and it provides a box of simple apparatus, and loan collec-

tions illustrative of various manufactures, animal physiology, and mechanics. On
May 7 it unanimously passed a resolution that, ' In the opinion of this Board it

would be expedient to include the elements of natural science amongst the recog-
nised subjects of class examination, under Article 19, c. 1, of the Education Code,'
and on June 27 a deputation of the Board presented a memorial to that effect to
the Lord President of the Council.

     At the present time, out of 1074 male and 1790 female teachers, 888 males and
442 females hold advanced science certificates, varying in number from 1 to 2-3, as

will be seen in the following table :

for the profitable pursuit of advanced studies in one direction or another. Directly

a pupil arrives at that point at which he may demonstrate his adaptability for

special lines of training he should have the opportunity of availing himself of the

best instruction he can get in that particular direction. This can be best earned

out by providing centres at ·which the special training may be carried on under

better conditions than is possible in separate schools. In every town of even

moderate size there should be a special school to which might be drafted those

pupils of either sex who demonstrate in their early career an adaptability for

advanced training.   For  every  special  subject  there  should  be  special  teachers of

                    _

approved qualifications, training, and skill; one teacher might take a group of

subjects. There should be scholarships or exhibitions enabSng naturally gifted

pupils to pursue their studies longer than would be possible without such helps,

and the course of instruction should in each case be directed in view of a con-

sideration of the position in life which the pupil is hereafter likely to fill. Branches

of science more immediately bearing upon the industries of the district should be

brought prominently forward, so as to provide for the training of young people who

may hereafter be intelligent artisans, foremen, and managers. There need be no

fear of educating young people beyond what is suitable for their station in life.

The clever pupil should not be taken away from the elementary school at too early

an age, so as to afford discouragement to his teacher there, and, on the other hand,

he should be well grounded in all the essential subjects, so that he may pursue with

the greatest benefit the special course. The expense of the scheme proposed

would be less than might at first be imagined. Grants for special subjects, as

already provided for in the new code, and the grants in aid of science and art

teaching administered by the South Kensington authorities, should be available

they woidd produce more satisfactory results than those which are at present too

commonly obtained. There should be also evening classes for the further advance-

ment of students after they have entered upon their business career.

3. Some Account of the System of Instruction in Elementary Science intro-

    duced by the Liverpool School Board into their Schools. By Edwaed M.

     Hance, LL.B., Clerk to the Liverpool School Board.

    Almost as soon as the Liverpool School Board had any schools of their own to
manage, they were painfully struck with what appeared to them the mechanical,

monotonous, and utterly uninteresting character of the instruction then generally
imparted in elementary schools. They felt that the incessant and almost entirely

unrelieved grind at reading, writing, and arithmetic, in which the attainment of
mechanical accuracy appeared to be the ultimate aim, did very little, if anything,

to develop the intelligence of the children, and was calculated to defeat its own

object by generating in a great majority of cases a distaste for intellectual attain-
ments. They were impressed therefore with the necessity of providing a some-
what more varied curriculum, and especially with the importance of introducing
some subject calculated to awaken the observing faculties of the children. In the

choice of subjects they were by no means free, for though in theory they may
perhaps be at liberty to introduce subjects not specified in the New Code of the

Education Department, they are practically almost unable to do so, since teachers
under a system of payment by results are naturally anxious to devote their main

energies to subjects that will ' pay ' in the Government examination. At this point

the board obtained the valuable advice of Professor Huxley, (Jolonel Donnelly, and
one or two other gentlemen of eminence in the world of science. The result was,
at their suggestion the board selected 'Mechanics' for boys, and 'Domestic
Economy ' for girls, as the subjects most suitable for their purpose, the definition

of these subjects given in the New Code being of such a nature as to allow of the

instruction being considerably expanded, in the one case in the direction of
elementary physics, and in the other in that of elementary chemistry, physics, and
physiology. In reference to the system of instruction, it was decided to absolutely
abandon the use of textbooks, and to rely entirely upon oral instruction, illustrated

by, or rather explaining, a series of experiments performed by the science instructor.
It then became necessary to determine whether the children should receive

instruction at their own schools or at certain fixed centres ; the latter method
would have greatly economised the time of the instructor and have diminished the
number of lessons required, while it would have allowed of somewhat more delicate

apparatus being used. In view, however,of the requirements of the Education Depart-
ment, that the ' attendances ' upon which a large share of the Government grant
depends, shall each be of two hours' continuous instruction, and of the importance
of having one or more of the teachers present at the demonstration, in order that

they may subsequently go over with the children the subject of each lecture, it was
decided to have the instruction given in each school separately. The system
followed was this. The science instructor prepared for each week a lesson in
mechanics for the boys of each of the two groups into which the schools of the
Board are divided, and in domestic economy for the girls of one of these

groups, that is, three lessons per week, of which each lesson necessitated a
different set of apparatus. The lessons to one group would be given during the
earlier, those of the other during the later days of the week. The requisite
apparatus was transported from school to school in a small hand-cart by a boy

specially employed for the purpose. By this means the instructor was enabled to

give four lessons each day, or twenty in the course of the week. In each school
the children in the three upper Standards (IV., V., and VT.) were during the first
year grouped together into one class for the purpose of this instruction, but after

the following examination by the Government inspector, when the children were
all moved a standard higher, and those who had previously formed Standard III.
entered on Standard IV., a second class became necessary. This increased the
number of lessons required in each week, and it became necessary to appoint an
assistant to the original science instructor, and now after the expiration of a second

year, and the formation of a third class in each school, a second assistant has been

--required ; but, in the instruction of the later stages when the children have been

--already well grounded in the subject a larger share is left to the ordinary

teachers of the school, so that the actual demonstrations given by the science in-

structor or his assistants in each school are as follows. Boys, Stage I., one lesson

per week ; boys, Stage II., one per fortnight ; boys, Stage III., one per month.

Girls, Stage I., one lesson per fortnight ; Stage II., one per fortnight; Stage III.,

one per month. Although a large proportion of the demonstrations are now given

by the assistants, each lesson is still prepared by the science instructor, and is

actually delivered by him in one school in the presence of the assistant, who is
afterwards to give that lesson in other schools. The number of children now

under instruction is about 2700, and will shortly be 3,000. The cost to the
board has been about \00l. for the stock of apparatus, and about 470/. a year for
salaries to the instructor and his assistants. This amount is diminished by one

half the grant earned from Government, the other half being for each school paid

in equal proportions to the science instructor and the head teacher. The experi-

ment has so far been very successful, the demonstrations are extremely popular
with the children, and have made a perceptible increase in their intelligence,
especially among the elder children, and even more markedly among the girls

than the boys.

            4. Reformatory Punishment. By F. T. Mott, F.B.Q.S.

     The reformation of the criminal is the only basis of social punishment which is

--consistent with the highest morality. Upon this principle the following system of

punishment is suggested, viz.: 1. That the criminal, when convicted, should be
removed from those influences under which the crime has been committed, and
treated as a weak and selfish child. 2. That he should be detained for no definite
period, but until he has given evidence that he is not likely to commit crime again.

3. That prison discipline should consist in teaching every one to labour for the
benefit of the others, the principal test of reformation being the willingness to
sacrifice ease and comfort continuously for the good of others. 4. That Courts
                                                 --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                479

should be established, with the best guarantees obtainable for impartiality and
practical wisdom, to determine when each criminal is fit for freedom.

     The first result of this system would be to clear the country of habitual
criminals, and to fill the jails ; but in a few years crime would be much diminished,

and the moral tone of the people greatly elevated.

5. On the Feasibility and Importance of Extending to Scotland the proposed

    Criminal Code for England and Ireland. By W. Neilson Hancock,

     LL.D., M.B.I.A.

The criminal code first proposed for England only, after inquiry, was proposed to

Abe extended to Ireland also.  delay has occurred in passing it, which afforded

an opportunity of including Scotland also. The system of public prosecution so

long prevailing in Scotland, and partially adopted in Ireland, had been partially

adopted in England. The complete system in Scotland led to some great

economies and simplification of procedure, in dispensing with the double pre-

liminary inquiry before coroners and magistrates and the double attendance of

witnesses before grand juries and petit juries, the Scotch dispensing altogether

with inquests and with grand juries, except in cases of treason. If grand juries

were preserved for the two classes of cases of private prosecution and treason

and offences against public authority, the double attendance of witnesses might

be obviated in the vast majority of cases, and grand juries woidd not be necessary

in Scotland to a greater extent than at present. The English Metropolitan police

report shows numbers of cases abandoned from cost and trouble of prosecution.

The system of inquests might also be limited to a few cases to be conducted more

on the plan of Board of Trade inquiries as to ships, and railway inquiries as to

accidents, and a few other special cases, so the Scotch would not have to adopt

inquests. The Statistical European Congress held at St. Petersburg in 1870,

Arecommended uniform criminal tables for all Europe.  criminal code is the

first step towards uniform statistics for England, Scotland, and Ireland. The

value of statistical comparison is shown by some results of the first complete

comparison of Scotch, English, and Irish crime. In the same population the

English figure for crimes against property with violence was 1,014, the Scotch

3,175, and the Irish 458. The Scotch figure for assaults and breaches of the peace

98,145, the English 22,000, and the Irish 38,351. The first excess was accounted

for by the peculiarity of the Scotch Poor Law which prohibited guardians from

relieving the able-bodied, however great their distress might be. The second by

the weakness of the Scotch in police, only 5,034, as compared with 12,546 for

Ireland, and 6,670 for England in the same popidation. The paper also suggested

the importance of reducing the law as to offences disposed of summarily to a code.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1879.

The President delivered the following Address :

I cannot commence my address to the present meeting of this Section without

myreferring to the very brilliant essay delivered last year at Dublin by  predeces-

sor, Dr. Ingram, and which has justly attained an European fame and circulation.

It was at once a vindication of the claim of Sociology to a high place in the pro-

ceedings of this Association, and a protest against the somewhat narrow limits and

methods which political economists have for some time past imposed on themselves.

With most of his arguments and statements I cordially- concur. So far from

agreeing that this is a time when we should ahandon sociological inquiry as beyond

the limits of true science, I venture to think there never was a time when it was

more desirable that these subjects should be treated in a scientific manner.

I do not purpose, however, on the present occasion to follow Dr. Tngram further

in his philosophical disquisition on the proper limits of economic inquiry, but I

shall endeavour to deal with one of the many questions which are unquestionably

open to us.

There can scarcely be a more interesting economic question at the present time

Howthan the state of agriculture and the causes of its present depression.    deeply

important is it that we should be able to trace the causes of that depression, to
analyse how far they are of a climatic and temporary character, and how far they

are due to the competition of foreign produce ; to what extent also the low prices

are due  to  the  alteration  in  value  of  gold                         and, having ascertained this, to discuss
                                                                       ;

how far we may expect these causes or any of them to continue or to diminish in

their effect, and to estimate their ultimate effect upon rents, on wages, and on the

profits of farmers, and indirectly upon other interests of the community.

Pending the investigations of the Royal Commission recently appointed to con-

sider the subject, it may seem almost an act of temerity to venture upon it ; but

the Report of the Commission will probably not be forthcoming for two years ; in

the meantime events will not wait for it, and it is desirable that every light should

be thrown upon the subject by independent criticism and observation. I feel also

that I owe no apology for so doing, for although the community in which we

meet is essentially a manufacturing one, yet it will be admitted that the depression

of a great interest like that of agriculture has a serious import and effect upon every

other interest in the country, and is probably at this moment one of the causes of

the stagnation which is so much complained of in the manufacturing world.

It must be admitted most freely that the agricultural interest, or at least a

large part of it, has suffered severely during the last few years from a combination

of bad harvests and low prices. These phenomena are especially to be noted since

the year 1873 ; of the six years including and following that year, four have

been years of exceptionally bad harvests, giving results of from 20 to 25 per cent,

below the average ; and for the whole period the average production of cereals has

been 13 per cent, below the average. In the memory of living men there has been

no such concurrence of bad seasons.

Bad harvests, however, in previous years were generally followed by higher

prices, which recouped the producers to a great extent for the deficient quantity

but bad harvests during the last six years have not only not been followed by

higher prices, but in the case of wheat at least, prices have fallen still lower, and

the consequence has been most serious to those who rely mainly on this cereal.

But when, in addition to the low price of wheat, we take into account the reduced

acreage of corn cultivation, the reduced number of cattle owned in the country,

notwithstanding the greatly increased price of meat, and the rise of wages of agri-

cultural labourers which occurred in 1872, we can easily realise the great losses of
those farmers who rely mainly upon corn for their returns, and who cultivate the

heavy and inferior lands of this country.

     The produce of wheat is so important a part of the agricultural industry of so

large a proportion of the country, that it may be taken as to a great extent an index

of the position of agriculture ; its abundance and price are also of not less interest to

the bulk of the population of this country, who rely upon it mainly for their food.

It is worth while, therefore, to pay special attention to this product. The position
of the producer with respect to it may best be estimated by multiplying the known

average produce per acre in each year by the average price obtained for it in the

twelve months succeeding the harvest.

I have before me a table constructed on this basis, showing the average product

in money per acre of wheat for each year since 1849. It shows that for the first

four of these years following shortly after the repeal of the Corn Laws the pro-

duction of wheat must have been anything but profitable to farmers ; the harvests
were somewhat above the average, but the prices were very low, averaging only 41s.

per quarter, and the result in money to the farmer for an average acre of produce
                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                              481

was only 71. 9s. ; after that year prices again rose, and for the next twenty years

the average product per acre in money was 91. 13s., or 21. 4s. per acre above that of

the four years succeeding 1848. During these twenty years it is to be observed

that the price of wheat as a general rule varied inversely as the quantity produced,

in other words, a very good harvest was succeeded by lower prices than the average,

a bad harvest was followed by higher prices, and the farmer was compensated in
a great degree by a higher price for the deficiency of the harvest ; thus in 1863 the

best harvest of the period, the production was 41 per cent, in excess of the average,

and the price fell to 40s. lid. per quarter, the result to the farmer being 10/. 0s. 6d.

per acre ; and in 1867 the harvest wa9 the worst of the period, 26 per cent, below the

average, but the price rose to 68s. 4d. per quarter, giving a result to the farmer of

8/. 17s. per acre.

  In 1873                                   we observe  a  marked  change in  this  relation  between quantity  and

_

price, and it is obvious that some causes must have operated from that time to

depress prices to a very marked degree. Unfortunately for the producers, the six

years which followed 1873 have been years of very serious deficiency of pro-

duction                                 as  ah-eady shown the harvests have been 13 per cent, below the average.
                                     ;

In lieu, however, of rising in proportion to this deficiency, the price of wheat

has fallen somewhat lower than on the average of previous years. It has been

49s. Id. per quarter, as compared with 55s. 5f/., the average of the previous six

years of good harvests ; the result, therefore, in product per acre has been an

average for the six years of only 71. 9s., or exactly the average of the four years

1849-52, while the average of the last four years has been even lower, namely,

71. 4s. 5d. per acre, or 21. 8s. Qd. per acre below the average of the twenty years

from 1853 to 1872. It is obvious from these figures that the reduced product per

acre is due, not merely to the deficient quantity, but also to a fall of prices ; and
so far from the prices having risen in inverse proportion to the bad harvests, there

has been a distinct tendency to fall in spite of the bad harvests.

    From these figures it is easy to estimate how great has been the deficiency

to the producers of wheat upon their average crops of the last six years. The

present extent of wheat production in the United Kingdom is about 3,300,000

acres, and compared with the average of the previous twenty-four years, including

the bad years succeeding 1849, the last six show a reduction of gross product of

about 21. per acre, equal to an annual reduced gross return of 6,600,000/. For the

six years, then, the reduced return to the producers of this cereal has been

39,600,000/. It is quite clear, then, that the position of those farmers who rely
upon wheat for their main profit, and who have suffered most from the wet seasons

of the last few years, has been very serious, and the prospect of another bad

harvest must be most discouraging to them.

Before, however, we examine the causes of this, and speculate as to the future,

let us look at the question from the point of view of the consumers. To the public
who are consumers the failure of the harvest is a matter of as much regret as to

the producers. It is the interest of all that the product should be plentiful. It

cannot, however, be said to be equally the interest of all that the price of wheat

should be high, or even that it should rise in proportion to the deficiency of

harvest. If the increased price were paid wholly to the producers of this country,

the money would at least remain here and be circulated again among the community;

but as the greater part of the wheat consumed now comes from abroad, a rise in

value not only raises the price to the home producer but also to the foreign pro-

ducer, and the increased price paid to the consumer is so much loss to the country

as a whole. For many years past the proportion of importations to the home pro-

duction of wheat has been increasing. Thirty years ago we imported little more

than one-fourth of our total consumption, during the last six years we have imported

considerably more than the half our total wants. Comparing the last six years

with the previous six years, it will be observed that the proportions of home
growth and foreign imports have been reversed ; in the first period we produced

12,000,000 quarters and imported 10,000,000 ; in the second period we produced

10,000,000 and imported 13,000,000 quarters.

The following table will show at a glance how rapid has been the growth of

1879.                                                              Ii

impossible must be the attempt to revert to any expedient for artificially raising

the price of wheat in the interest of the home producers. Any arguments there
may have been 30 years ago in favour of such a course, are multiplied tenfold at
the present time, when the proportion of imports to home produce is so greatly

altered.

     Let me now revert again to the table showing the gross product in money per

acre of wheat. I have already pointed out that in the year 1873 there evidently
came into operation causes which exercised a very powerful influence on the price

of wheat, and which prevented its rise at a time when deficient harvests would

have led us to expect a very considerable rise. I do not think it is difficult to trace

and determine one and the main of these causes. It appears to me to be very

intimately connected with that which is the main cause of the commercial depres-

Wesion of the last few years.  know that between the years 1869-1872 there was

an extraordinary inflation of trade in America, due mainly to the enormous exten-

sion of railways in the Western States ; this was in a great measure stimulated by
reckless and unwise concessions of Congress, which gave away millions of acres of
land to the companies who obtained concessions for their lines, and by reckless and

unwise lending by capitalists and investors in this country and Germany. In four

years not less than 17,000 miles of new railways were constructed. The installa-
tion of these new lines, and the consequent speculation, led to an enormous and un-

natural development of the iron and coal industries in America, and to immense

importations of iron rails from England ; it also stimulated prices generally, and was
a main cause of the inflation of that period.

     The immediate result of this vast extension of the railway system in the
Western States was to bring to market a great amount of corn already being

grown in those districts, and which had hitherto been beyond the range of the

English markets, and the effect of this doubtless began to be felt on the price of
wheat in England about the year 1873.

     Its next effect was to produce a reaction and collapse without parallel to any
which we have experienced in the last 30 years. The collapse was mainly felt

in the American States. In 1873 no less than 7,000 miles of railway became bank-
rupt and were sold up by their creditors. The iron manufactures which had been

called into existence were involved in the collapse nearly one half of those in the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

States stopped work. The importation of iron from England fell to zero. The

loss of capital engaged in these new railways and ironworks told in a hundred ways

upon the commercial prosperity of the States, and indirectly, though by no means to

the same extent, upon our own. Thousands of labourers were thrown out of work

in the manufacturing districts of America. Their imports fell off by 40,000,000/.

a year, or 32 per cent. There is no better illustration of the distress caused
in America than the almost total cessation of emigration to it from this coimtry.
The intending emigrants soon learned that they had nothing to gain by transferring

themselves across the Atlantic. There was greater difficulty in finding work in

New York, Philadelphia, and even Chicago, than at Liverpool or in Ireland. In

each of the years 1872 and 1873 the emigrants had numbered 230,000, in 1876

and 1877 there was an excess of returning emigrants.

    What followed must have affected, even more powerfully, the prices of agri-

cultural produce in this country. The great surplus of unemployed labour has
during the last five years been transferred from the manufacturing districts and

great towns in the Atlantic States to the new districts opened out by the railway

extension of the previous years. The cultivation, therefore, of corn in these newly
opened-out fields has increased at a ratio never before experienced. The new railways,

constructed before there was population or trade to supply them, stimulated this
new settlement by lowering their traffic rates to a minimum ; the commercial de-

pression operated upon the steam-carrying trade across the Atlantic in the same
manner, and greatly lowered freights ; coincident with this movement there has
been a succession of abundant harvests in America, while this country was suffer-
ing from such deficient harvests.

     So great a movement in the direction of increased cultivation of the surface of
the earth has probably never been yet experienced in so short a period, nor has

                               n2

there ever been so rapid and great a reduction of the cost of transit, both by land
and sea.

Weprice in bad seasons.
                                                    can scarcely as yet estimate its effect upon the price

in average seasons or when harvests are above the average in this country. The

bad harvests here have been balanced by exceptionally good harvests in the States

we have yet to learn what may be the result upon prices here of indifferent

Aharvests in America.                       diminished production of one bushel to the acre in this

· coimtry results in a loss of less than half a million of quarters ; a reduction to

the same amount in the United States will produce an aggregate loss of three and a

Ahalf million quarters, or one-third of her exporting power.                   general bad harvest,

therefore, may even now materially interfere with her exports. In 1859, and again

in 1865 and 1866, the exports from America were reduced to very small amounts

by bad harvests, after having been exceptionally large, and there may be similar

variations in the future. It is probable also that the effect of the recent bad

seasons and low prices will be to reduce still further the acreage of wheat cultiva-

tion in this country. In future, therefore, we must look for an ever-increasing
requirement from abroad for our wheat consumption. An average harvest in this

country will produce not more than eleven million quarters, leaving twelve millions

Afor imports.                harvest 20 per cent, above the average will still necessitate the

importation of ten millions. It is quite possible, and indeed probable, that a bad

harvest in the States, coincident with a good harvest here, may raise the price of

wheat so as to give a large profit to the farmer. There are many questions also

affecting the future production in America and the future balance remaining for

exportation which have to be considered. The increase of population there is

rapid                        new districts  become  quickly peopled ;  States  which a few  years  ago were
                          ;

large exporters are now producing no more than suflicent for their own consump-

tion; others are become importers, and every year the centre line of wheat

Aproduction is being carried farther to the westward.                          general revival of trade

will probably increase the traffic rates of the Western railways and the Atlantic

freights. These and many other causes may in future tend to raise the average

price of wheat and other agricultural produce in the States.

If I were to venture a prediction on so difficult and obscure a question, I would

incline to the opinion that wheat has during the past year reached its lowest point

that we have felt the maximum of the effect of the recent great extension of com

production in the Far West ; that with the revival of trade, the increase of popu-

lation both here and in the States, and the tendency to reduced cultivation

of wheat in this country, there will be a rise in the price of wheat ; and that,

coupled with better harvests in this country, or, at least, a return to average harvests,

we may find the product to the farmer in money such that the difference as com-

pared with the past is capable of adjustment by a comparatively slight reduction

of rent and wages.

The business of farmers, especially in this country, where it is separated from

the ownership of land, and is connected with the land only by contracts of

short date, is one which cannot be carried on without such a rate of profit as

will induce capital to embark in it. It is certain, therefore, that such an adjust-

ment of profits, rents, and wages must be made as to enable the business to be

carried on, and it is probable that this adjustment will be made before the Royal

Commission recently appointed can conclude its labours.

    It may be worth while to point out that the competition of the Far West has

told upon other lands much nearer to it than our own country. The farming inte-
rest of the New England States, and even of some of the other Atlantic States,

has been much affected by it during the last few years. The value of land in these

States, remote from the larger towns, has been much reduced, and large numbers

of farmers from New England have been induced to leave their homes and settle

in the new opened-out district in the West. Their place has been taken in part by

Irishmen and in part by Frenchmen from Canada, who are content to farm in a

more humble maimer, and who can get a living by laborious and minute attention

which their predecessors disdained to give to the land. At the same time a great

change has come over the manufacturing industry of New England. It is not
many years ago that its factories were mainly supplied by the sons and daughters

of the New England farmers of the true Anglo-Saxon descent. This class has

now  all hut disappeared                                                                       the factory workers  are now Irishmen  or  Frenchmen, and
                                                                                            ;

form a true manufacturing population. The true New Englander is rarely found there,

except in a position of trust as overlooker or manager. The change which has

taken place, and the depreciation in the value of land, has not affected the total

value of property in New England. The low price of food has been a great benefit

to the manufacturing industry, and the aggregate wealth of these States never
was greater than at the present time.

If the competition of the great corn-fields of the Far West has thus told upon

States so near at hand, it is to be expected that some of its effects would be

felt in this country. Although the position of the farming interest for the twenty

years preceding 1873 was satisfactory and fairly prosperous, yet it was certainly
not progressive. The cultivation of wheat has gradually diminished, and the
breeding and feeding of cattle has been substituted for it ; the dependence of this
country upon foreign produce for its food has every year become greater ; the num-

ber of persons employed in agriculture has remained stationary, and their propor-

tion to the rest of the population has been continually diminished. The whole

increase of population during the last forty years has been absorbed in other-

pursuits than agriculture. In 1831, 28 per cent, of the population of England and

Wales was occupied in the business of agriculture ; the proportion is now less

than one-tenth                                                                       and great as still  is  the  importance of the agricultural interest as
                                                                                  ;

compared with any other, its relative importance to the whole manufacturing and

commercial interests of this country is greatly changed. That, notwithstanding

this, the wealth of the country has increased by enormous leaps and bounds in the

interval is indisputable, and especially was this the case in the few years preceding
1873. That we have been able to provide for a population increasing by about three

millions in every ten years, without any increase of territory, and with a some-

what reduced agricultural industry, that we have been able to turn the tide of

pauperism, and to reduce it considerably as compared with the past, is a most

striking fact, and strong testimony to the soundness of our general system. It may

be that the enormous agricultural development in America will drive us further on

the same road                                                                        but that it will permanently injure  the  economic condition of this
                                                                              ;

country as a whole is not to be believed.

If, then, I am right in my explanation of the agricultural depression, it may be

connected not remotely with the depression which has weighed so heavily upon com-

merce and manufactures also during the last five years. Both are probably due in

the main to causes operating over a great area and over a long period, and are indica-

tions of the flow of the great tide of population and cultivation advancing

over the great plains of America. The collapse of credit in 1873, and the conse-

quent discredit and depression, has been much more felt on the other side of the

Atlantic than on this. The imports to the States fell off enormously ; the

investment there of foreign capital wholly ceased. In this country we have felt

severely the temporary loss of our largest customer for our exports ·                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 but our other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

customers in every part of the world have made up for the bulk of our exports,

though not for their value.

I am confident, however, it will be found, on making a comparison between this

country and others, that we have passed through the period of depression with

--infinitely less suffering to the bulk of the people, and with less real loss of capital,

than in any other part of the world excepting perhaps France, which has been saved
by the extraordinary thrift of her working population ; and that free imports and
consequent low prices have saved the labouring classes from what would otherwise

have been a period of far greater distress to them. Already there are symptoms of

revival in that quarter from whence the principal cause of the depression issued.

All accounts from America testify to the improved condition of trade, to the fact

that the immense extension of agriculture is producing its natural effect in reviving a

demand for manufacturing products, which her own workshops will soon be unable to
supply. With reviving trade and renewed confidence in America, the investment

     1 Our exports to the United States fell from an average of 36 millions for the
three years ending 1873, to 16 millions for the last three years.
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  487

of capital will again flow towards it, and we may again confidently expect a renewal

of our export trade. It is impossible the people of the United States can long con-

tinue to supply the world with food and take nothing in return for it. On the other

hand, all past experience shows that in spite of high duties and protection rates, a

great import trade may exist, and may find the means of overcoming all the impedi-
ments of hostile tariffs. Within the last few weeks we have heard of an order for

20,000 tons of rails, to be manufactured in this town, and to be delivered at New

York, where the duty payable will be more than the cost price at Sheffield. The
trade returns of the last few months likewise show that in every item enumerated
there is a great increase of exports to America. As the United States, therefore,
have been the main cause of the past depression, so they may in the future be the
main cause of a reaction ; and the reaction which will tell first in trade and manu-

factures will certainly later reach the agricultural interest.

      It appears to me, then, that it would be a most useless waste of time and energy to
expend efforts in trying to reverse the commercial system established by Sir Robert
Peel in 1846, or in making inquiries with a view to a return to exploded fallacies
and obsolete systems ; but it is a time, when attention having been so much directed

to the condition of agriculture, we may with great advantage inquire whether the

conditions under which it is carried on in this country are such as to attract and
encourage to the utmost the application of capital and labour to the land ; whether
a system of tenure which seems calculated to forbid the combination of ownership
and occupation, to prevent security for improvements effected by the occupier, and

to accumulate land in the hands of persons who are frequently unable to afford

capital for its improvement, is the best suited for the development of agricultural

industry. Although changes in such a system may not be fraught with imme-
diate remedies for present depression, and may not affect the price of produce, yet
they may tend ultimately to place the cultivators in a better position to meet the

varying conditions of the future ; which in agriculture, as in other trades, must be
expected to present alternate periods of prosperity and loss.

The density of the population in general in the borough is only 15T per acre.

But a large part of the area is wild moorland, never built on, while some parts are

The marriage rate is also high. In 1875 it was 22 per 1000 living, while the rate

for all England was only 16-8. In 1877 it had fallen to 17-9 per 1000, the rate

for all England being 15-8. Last year the death-rate was 24-8 per 1000, or -4

.above the rate in the twenty largest towns, if London be included, during the nine

years 1870-78. But there has been a considerable improvement in the mortality

of late years. In fact, Birmingham is the only town of equal size which has had

as low a death-rate during the past nine years, if London be excluded. Zymotic

and local diseases are the most fatal in Sheffield. Hitherto no hospital has existed

in the town for the treatment of infective fevers, but the Sanitary Authority is

building one which will, when finished, be one of the most complete in the

kingdom.

which is deserving of the greatest attention. The table exhibiting the average

age at death during 1862-71, and -embracing 10,000 deaths, reveals many remark-

able facts. There is some reason to believe that the mortality among grinders is

not so excessive as it was, though it is still very high. According to the table it

was in 1862-71 44 years ; from the tables for 1878 it was 47-3.
     The following table contains the particulars of the number of deaths, and the

average age at death among various classes of workmen in Sheffield during the

Ayear 1878, and also the numbers dying at certain groups of ages.  few years ago

it was currently believed that a grinder aged above fifty was a curiosity in

Sheffield. But we see from the table that thirty-eight died over fifty years of age

in 1878, or 45 -2 per 100 of the total number of deaths.

in Sheffield, the average age at death was only 34, the same as among rollers,

though the former are enlisted in the prime of life, are well fed, housed, and

clothed, and have easy work, while the latter live under very trying conditions.

During the past five years 2004 persons have been buried in Sheffield without any

certificate from a properly qualified medical man as to the cause of death. This

is done, no doubt, in accordance with law, but it is undoubtedly a law which calls

loudly for amendment. Another great defect in our sanitary legislation is the

Anwant of a registration of disease.  epidemic has often made considerable pro-

gress in the town before the Sanitary Authority becomes aware of its existence,
the first intimation of which may be the return of the death of some victim. The
great and laudable energy displayed in getting children into school nowadays

renders it imperative that the master should be aware where the infective diseases

exist, and the brothers and sisters of children suffering from such disease should be

rigidly excluded from school until there is proper certification that they can return

without danger to themselves or others. It is a cruel and unjustifiable thing to

compel children to come to school, and, as at present, take no precaution to see

that their life or health is not the penalty. Indeed, the schooling arrangement

should be in other respects also supervised by proper medical authorities, seeing

that a School Board has such power for good or evil over the physical health of a

large part of the population in the tender years of growth. The lighting, venti-

lation, and warming of the schoolroom, the construction of the seats, the colouring

of the walls, the age for schooling, and the hours of attendance, are all alike

subjects on which every School Board should have the advice of skilled and ex-

perienced medical men. The hygiene of the sight of school children is in itself an
all-important subject not to be lightly considered. The common employment of

rough opaque glass for schoolroom windows, by which much light, so necessary

for life, is excluded, and any accommodation of the eyes for distant vision during

school hours is prevented, cannot be too earnestly deprecated. By means of

gymnastic exercise much might be done to promote the bodily vigour of the

children. It should be impressed on every child that the most important know-

ledge it can acquire is how to maintain the body in health and vigour. This is a

necessary condition for the acquisition of a sound education and for the full en-

joyment of life. It is to be hoped that the time is near at hand when hygiene
will be a compulsory subject in every school, and that at least as much time will
be devoted to the study of the living body, and how to maintain it in health, as is

given to the study of dead languages and of inert matter. Sickness is the fruitful

parent of poverty and crime. The miseries it entails are worse than war or

famine; its victims are infinitely more numerous. But there is reason for antici-

pating that the great increase in the value of fife, and the steady decrease in mor-

tality which has been witnessed even withiu a comparatively short time, will be

more marked still in the future, as our knowledge and scientific methods of re-

search become perfected.

2. On the Savings of the People as evidenced by the Returns of the Trustees'
and Post Office Savings Banks. By Professor Leone Levi, F.B.G.S., 8rc, 8rc.

    myIn last report to Mr. Bass, M.P., on the earnings of the labouring classes,

including labourers and artisans, their total amount in 1878 was estimated at about

422,000,000/., of which 350,000,000/. was in cash, and 72,000,000/. in board, lodging,
clothing, and other perquisites. The wages were somewhat higher in 1878 than in
1866, when I made a similar estimate, though considerably lower than in 1872 and
1873. Yet the total amount of earnings was not greater, as the stagnation in
trade reduced the number of labourers and the number of days they were actually
earning wages. The difference in wages to the working men of the United Kingdom
between prosperous and bad times was upwards of 50,000,000/. per annum; and it

is interesting to ascertain how far our labouring classes have as yet learned to set
aside something for a rainy day. In the three years from 1871 to 1873, when

 wages rose at least twenty per cent., and in some cases forty and fifty per cent., the

labouring: classes received in hard cash some 70,000,000/. per year, or a total of

210,000,000/. more than the normal amount. The cost of living, however, increased

during those three years ; a rise of wages was not all gain to the working man,

for the cost of production increased, and higher prices had to be paid for food,

rent, and every enjoyment. That rise was estimated at ten per cent. ; therefore

105,000,000/., were required for the increased cost of living in the three years.

Allowing five per cent, more for a legitimate increase of the comforts of life in

times of prosperity, or 42,500,000/. in the three years, or in all 147,500,000/., there

still remained 63,000,000/. which should have been saved and stand now to the

credit of the labouring classes in some form or other. Since 1872 wages had

suffered a considerable fall, yet even now in many occupations the wages were

liberal, and, with the lower prices of many articles of consumption, there might

be room for saving something if only a sense of economy and proper management

prevailed in the households of the working population ; for at least the half of the

last eight years, wages were most liberal, and afforded ample room for saving a

handsome amount. What trace of these savings did they find stored in the Savings

--Banks ? The account of the savings in 1870 and 1878 stood as follows : In 1870

Trustees' Savings Banks 37,958,000/., Post Office Savings Banks 15,099,000/.--total

52,987,000/. ; in 1878, Trustees' Savings Banks, 44,293,000/., Post Office Savings

Banks, 30,412,000/.--total 74,705,000/. Thus the Savings Banks in 1878 possessed

21,700,000/. more than in 1870. Deducting 14,000,000/. for interest, there remained

7,500,000/. saved in this form out of all the extra wages in the eight years. It cannot

be  said  that what was saved in 1873 had been since  lost  and withdrawn                                                                for the

had existed for centuries at Ghent. In an equal population for those in asylums
and lunatic wards in workhouses, the English figure was 8,636, the Scotch 9,438,
and the Irish 11,616. The English boarding-out figure was 1,620, and the Scotch
2,097. Under the power of sending paupers to private asylums 609 were provided
for in England. In Ireland there were no paupers boarded-out or sent to private
asylums. The adoption of the Scotch law in Ireland would provide for 2,097
boarded-out, the adoption of the English law for 609 in private asylums, or 2,706
in all. Of the Irish 3,000 neglected lunatics 2706 would thus be provided for : it
followed that the non-assimilation of the laws was almost the sole cause of the
3,000 neglected lunatics in Ireland being in the state they were in. As to the

protection of the property of lunatics, the Scotch Law Commissioners and Scotch

Lunacy Commissioners had for years suggested that the County Court judges
should have the jurisdiction of appointing care-takers of lunatics' property when
of small value. In 1865, the English County Court judges had got this jurisdiction
in the case of minors ; in 1877, the Irish County Court judges had got it for
minors also. In the past session a Bill was brought in by Mr. Ramsey, Mr. Baxter,
Sir Graham Montgomery, and Mr. Dalrymple to give the Scotch County Court
judges similar jurisdiction as to lunatics. Lord O'Hagan brought in a similar Bill
for Ireland, but no Bill was brought in for England. The Scotch and Irish Bills
have been printed but not passed. If there was a uniform code as to the whole

three kingdoms of the law as to lunatics, this delay in legislation need not have
occurred ; and such assimilation as this and other branches of law is one of the

most effective means of diminishing the block of business in Parliament.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.

                 Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

          President of the Section--J. Eobinson, Pres. Inst. Mech. Eng.

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 1879.

       The President delivered the following Address:

On the Development of the Use of Steel during the last Forty Years,

                  considered in its Mechanical and Economic Aspects.

    Much has been written by poets and others of a succession of the Ages of the

--human race in comparing their degradation with the various kinds of metal, con-

sidered metaphorically thus we have the golden age, the silver age, the age of

brass, and the age of iron.

     Our own time may very appropriately and literally be described as a branch of
the latter age, and be named the age of steel.

     In the metropolis of the steel manufacture it would seem fitting that the Me-

chanical Section of this great scientific association should direct its attention to

this wonderful metal, the uses of which are daily becoming more numerous and

important.

    But it may be said, on the other hand, that as the use of this material is per-

petually growing more common, so are discussions as to its manufacture, composition,
and characteristics, becoming almost wearisome from their frequency.

     Notwithstanding an appearance of truth in this objection to our occupying more
time in referring to the subject, I would venture to entertain the hope that a treat-

ment of the question in its mechanical and economic aspects may prove not unin-

teresting to this meeting.

    At the time when railway extension was becoming general, about forty years

ago, the use of steel in this country was confined mainly to tools for mechanical
purposes, including files and other articles, springs for vehicles, weapons of various
sorts, and implements for agricultural and domestic uses ; and it is proposed to
measure the scientific and mechanical energy brought to bear upon the manufacture
and improvement of this metal, by the increase in the number of purposes to which
it is applied, and the diminished price at which it can be obtained, as compared
with the price at the time of its introduction for constructive works. There are,
however, several important exceptions to this method of appreciation to which
reference will hereafter be made.

   We will take, then, the simplest form in the preceding list, viz., tool steel, the

frice of which for ordinary purposes varied from 50s. to 56s. per cwt. at the period
  have named ; and we shall find that the development of the manufacture of steel

in general has but little affected this particular material, which is still produced in
much the same fashion, i.e., by the use of carefully selected Swedish iron, carburised
by exposure in ovens to the heat of burning charcoal, and then recast from crucibles
and hammered down to the required size. The result of a somewhat stationary
condition of manufacture has been the maintenance of prices at the same, or about
the same, level up to the present time.

   A superior quality of tool steel has been produced by the adoption of a process
--496
rei>ort 1879.

 invented by Mr. R. Mushet, in which titanium is introduced in the manufacture,,
 and which dates hack to the year 1838-39. This steel is of great endurance when
 applied to the working of steel and iron of considerable hardness, and its higher
 price of 140s. per cwt. is quite justified by the excellent results obtained from its
 use, and other steels of similar fine quality are produced by several manufacturers,

who make specialities of them.
      Some twenty-seven or twenty-eight years ago, Krupp, of Essen, gave an enor-

mous impulse to the application of steel, by his method of producing much larger

masses of crucible steel than had previously been possible. He at that time accom-

 plished the casting of an ingot of ' crucible ' steel of 50 cwt., a weight then con-
 sidered incredible, and this was followed up by the production of weldless cast
 steel tyres in 1852, which led to the very rapid development in the use of his steel
for railway tyres, cranked axles for locomotive and other engines, straight axles,
 and shafts, and parts of machines in general.

      It is most interesting to consider the prices of such of these objects as have up
 to this time maintained similar forms, with the object of ascertaining by the selling
 price the progress in the scientific and mechanical appliances used for the production

 of the materials just referred to.

     At the time of their coming into use, about twenty-five years ago, the price of
cast steel tyres was 120s. per cwt. ; it is now from 18s. to 25s. per cwt. The price
of forged steel cranked axles was, when first introduced, 151. per cwt. ; it is now

 from G5s. to 70s. per cwt.

     The price of straight axles and shafts was from 40s. to 50s. per cwt. ; it is now

from 19s. Qd. to 23s. per cwt.

    Now to what do we owe this enormous reduction of price and consequent more

frequent and more economic application ? The answer must be that, follow-
ing the initiation of Krupp, our English engineers and men of science set them-
selves to work to discover and apply new processes for the production and manufac-
ture of this most wonderful metal ; and I venture to say that in the whole history
of metallurgy, from the time of Tubal Cain downwards, there has been no such
progress in invention and manufacture as has been realised by the aid of such men as
Mushet, Krupp, Bessemer, Siemens, Whitworth, Martin, Bell, Bauschinger, Styffe,.
and many others within the period comprised in this retrospect ; and our national
predilections will perhaps lead us to the opinion that our own country may fairly

appropriate a large share of merit for the results achieved.

     Another of the uses of steel to which attention may be given is that of the

production of cannon of large size.
     Efforts had been made by some of our enterprising workers in metal to produce

large guns of solid wrought iron ; but the processes of heating and hammering
were attended with so much difficulty that the attempt was given up. Here again
Krupp stepped in, and succeeded, thirty-two years ago, in manufacturing cannon of
cast steel, which unhappily have become ordinary commodities with those nation-

alities who could afford such expensive weapons. Since that time Krupp has
produced about 2,000 guns, the heaviest being, when finished, 72 tons (16 inch).

     Sir William Armstrong and Sir Joseph Whitworth soon came into the field
with o-uns of their own invention. The former, by adopting the system of iron
coils applied externally to a central cylinder ; and the latter, by shrinking cylindrical
hoops on to a central cylinder made of cast steel.

      In the adaptation of the steel manufacture of the cast or crucible steel period
to the production of every object demanded by the march of engineering and
mechanical science, I need not mention the names of individuals and firms in this

town who have shown themselves equal to the task ; but I will venture to say that
their success has been such as to raise the town of Sheffield to the very pinnacle of

fame as producing steel of any, even the highest, quality demanded in the markets

of the world.

    I must now turn to a name honoured everywhere for the benefits and renown
he has brought to his country by his inventions and appliances, developed during

the last twenty-four or twenty-five years, in the manufacture of a steel which can
be cheaply produced and readily adapted to the requirements of the purchaser. I

--am sure the audience will in their minds anticipate the record of the name of

Bessemer a name which -will be handed down to posterity in connection with the

manufacture of steel as long as that manufacture exists.

     Another name which will most deservedly figure in the history of the develop-
ment of the steel manufacture is one, like that of Bessemer, which has been known

--not only in that development, but in connection with many other discoveries in

physical science I mean that of Siemens, who, like his compeer, has not only

invented processes, but has personally carried them out into practical application.

An expression let fall by the latter as President of the Iron and Steel Institute at

its meeting last year in Paris, exhibits very strikingly the absence of any other

feeling on the part of these two great men save that of the most friendly rivalry.

     Speaking of a comparison between the results of steel manufactured by the
Bessemer blowing process and the Siemens-Martin open-hearth process, Dr. Siemens

said, ' He did not see how the result could be the same. It might be better in the

Bessemer process than in the open-hearth for aught he knew, but it could not be
the same ;' and it seems to augur well for the advancement of science in our day
that so little of a contrary spirit is exhibited in the discussions which ensue from
time to time upon any improved process either chemical or mechanical, having for

its object the production of a better material and at a lower first cost. The name of
Robert Mushet may very properly be introduced here as one of our early inventors

of the improved processes for the manufacture of steel, and it is gratifying to find

that other countries besides England have learnt to appreciate the results obtained

by him during so many years of scientific and experimental research.

It is needless that I should do more in an assembly like that before me than

refer in the simplest terms to the differences in the processes of manufacture con-
nected with these names.

     In that of Bessemer, pig-iron of a selected quality is charged into what is
technically called a ' Converter,' a large iron vessel lined with refractory material,
into which air can be blown at considerable velocity by suitable blowing machinery.

This goes on until the iron is thoroughly exposed to the decarbonising influence of

the blast, and the impurities contained in the metal are driven off. When this

happens the blowing ceases, and a certain proportion of Spiegel eisen or of ferro-

nianganese is added to the charge so as to give the required amount of carbon.

Blowing recommences, this time only to effect complete mixture of the materials,

and then the casting of the ingots takes place of a quality corresponding to the
A --metal selected for the mixtures.
                                                                                                                   mild steel or, as it has been called, a pure

iron--is the resultant, and it is capable of being worked, welded, and hammered

very much as iu the case of the purest wrought irons ; but it possesses generally

a much higher tensile resistance and a greater ductility.

     In the Siemens-Martin or open-hearth process, a similar charge of pig-iron of

--the desired quality--probably haematite pig is put into the bed of a reverberatory

furnace of the regenerative system, and the necessary oxidation is produced by
adding to the molten mass iron ores, or oxides of iron in proportions ascertained by

experience, after which re-carbonisation is obtained by the addition of ferro-rnan-
ganese or Spiegel eisen as in the Bessemer process.

     These processes have been the great factors in that reduction in the cost price,
and therefore in the extension of the use of such objects as steel tyres, axles, shafts,
rails, &c, to which I have already referred, and which is so striking an instance of

the results which our men of science can accomplish by their physical and experi-

mental researches into the means of supplying the wants of our work-a-day

world.

I will now draw attention to another product of the steel manufacture which

is of immense importance, and which could not have been obtained for ordinary

--purposes but for the facilities of manufacture arising out of the inventions I have

just alluded to I mean that of steel castings, i.e., castings obtained from the

crucible, precisely in the form in which they are to be used in the construction of

machinery, just as is the case in ordinary cast iron run from the cupola furnace.

This production of castings for engineering purposes is gaining an enormous and

rapid development                                                                                        and when  it is considered  thati n this metal we obtain castings

of a strength at least three to four times that of the strongest iron castings, the

importance of this experimental discovery can scarcely be over-rated.

Nor must I pass over the application of these processes to the production of

boiler plates, bridge girder plates, and ship plates, in which, as a result of the

greater tensile resistance of such plates (reaching for ordinary uses a figure of about

twenty-eight to thirty-four tons to the square inch), the engineer is not only enabled

--to lighten°his structure, but to expect from it greater durability an expectation

not diminished by its greater capability of resisting corrosion, especially where

care is taken to exclude manganese from the mixture of the metals employed.

For specific purposes, and where price is not so much an element of consideration

as great tensile or percussive resistance, a more costly mode of manufacture has been

adopted by Sir Joseph Whitworth, whose attention was probably drawn to the

necessity for obtaining  sueh  a  metal, during  the construction of cannon  and tor-
                                                                     _

pedoes, but which has now been extended to objects of a very varied character.

The method of manufacture, which has been in use upwards of ten years, is by

casting ingots under very heavy hydraulic pressures, from very carefully selected

materials, the result being the production of a metal of enormous tensile resistance,

reaching in some instances the high figure of 100 tons per square inch, while at

the same time the bubbles and air vesicles which sometimes appear in metal pro-

duced in the ordinary methods are entirely or almost entirely got rid of, and the

consequent striations and imperfections of internal structure and external surface

disappear.

     It is hoped that ere long we shall be able to procure in this way cylindrical
boiler plates rolled solid from the ingot, much after the fashion in which weldless
steel tyres are now obtained, and that the weakening of these plates by the existing
necessity for forming horizontal riveted joints may thus be avoided.

     It is desirable before closing this, I fear, already somewhat long address, to call

attention to the most recent development of the steel manufacture as exhibited in

the processes of Messrs. Snellus, &Gilchrist, Thomas, by which iron containing a

considerable proportion of say T44 per cent, of phosphorus, may, in the course of

its manufacture into either Bessemer or Siemens-Martin steel, have this deleterious

matter entirely removed, or reduced to an inconsiderable proportion.

     The method of carrying out this operation was exceedingly well described at
the recent meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute in London, and it was shown
that where such irons were melted in vessels lined with a slag having twenty per
cent, of silica and thirty per cent, of lime and magnesia, the phosphorus was
gradually and effectually absorbed by this lining, and a steel of good quality, com-

paratively free from phosphorus and silica, was produced.
     The result to the community will naturally be that, as henceforth a much more

extended area of our iron fields both at home and abroad will become available for

the production of steel, the use of that metal will be still further extended and its
price reduced mainly by means of the methodical researches of our scientific me-
tallurgists, and entirely independently of those accidental combinations which have

in less scientific days led to the adoption of new and improved methods in the
production of metals required by the progress of mechanical and economic science.

     Since writing the above address two other matters have been brought before

me which may, I think, be interesting to this meeting.

     One is the specification for the steel to be used in the construction of the great
railway bridge over the Forth, the plates for the main girders and braces of which
are to be of ' mild steel,' giving a tensile resistance of 26 tons per square inch of
section ; while for the rivets, not only is the same tensile resistance to be given,
but the minimum of elasticity is to be 16 tons to the square inch, and the

elongation before breaking not less than 25 per cent.

     The bars and rods, which are to be made from ' high-class steel,' are to have a
tensile resistance of 40 tons per square inch, and a minimum of elasticity of 20

tons, while the elongation is to be 12£ per cent, before breaking.
     It will be seen from these figures that not only will the structure itself be

enormously lighter than if materials such as have been hitherto employed for such

purposes had been adopted, but that a considerable increase of durability is
anticipated from the chemical and molecular constitution of the metals selected.

     The other matter is the fact that a very large order for steel rails for America

--has been taken by a house of the highest eminence in this country at the price of

41. per ton delivered at the works a price which is almost astounding to those

who have lived long enough to remember the high price at which anjr quality of
steel coidd be produced in former years, and when a knife with real steel blades
was a prize valued because not always attained in the days of our childhood.

    It seems to me that these two facts amply illustrate the position taken up at

the beginning of this address, as indicating the scientific energy and mechanical

--enterprise brought to bear upon the production of steel in the one case by the

lessening of its cost, and in the other by a most important extension of its

application.

      The author, in this paper, drew attention to the fact that the temperature of
the water-supply of a town, as furnished by public waterworks, was totally inde-
pendent of the temperature of the water at its source of supply, and that invariably
the temperature of water was the temperature of the ground at any season of the
year at the depth at which the distributing mains were laid. The average tem-
peratures throughout the year, whatever the source or mode of supply, varied very
little, but there was great difference in the range of temperature, and that while
the temperature in the chalk wells at Croydon gave an average monthly range,
based upon daily observations, of 064°, the same water, when supplied direct from
the mains, gave an average monthly range of 21 - 14°, or when stored in a cistern a
range of 28'05° ; while water supplied from the Thames in Westminster gave an
average monthly range of 24"69°, but the average yearly difference of temperature
between the chalk water supplied at Croydon and the Thames water supplied in
Westminster was only 0'67°.

complete cessation of percolation in April. There is no such uniformity in the
wettest periods of equal duration, and in consequence percolation does not recom-
mence till the close of the longer wettest periods of thirty, sixty, and ninety days.
Mr. Evans's soil gauge frequently leaves off recording percolation a month earlier,
and hegins to record it again a month later, than Mr. Greaves's. Mr. Evans's
gauge is filled with a mixture of gravel, loam, and mould, and Mr. Greaves's of

      Characters of the Soil. The calibre of the constituent grains of the soil, and

the percentage of grains of various calibres in the natural admixture, should be

known for every soil on which percolation experiments are or have been carried
out. In a collection of grains of given calibre spheres will occupy more space than
any other shape, or the absorbent capacity is least when the grains are spherical.
The space occupied by any number of spheres, from one upwards, which exactly

lie in a cubic foot, is ·5236 cubic feet as long as the arrangement is cubical, the

retentive power increasing with the fineness of the grains. The natural arrange-
ment is, however, pyramidal, in which one sphere rests in the hollow between four.
As more spheres will thus go into a cubic foot the space occupied is somewhat
greater than - 5236, and the absorbent capacity somewhat less than -4764. The
absorbent capacity (pyramidal") decreases with the diminishing calibre of the grains.

     The determination of the percolative capacity at saturation point has a practical
bearing, as it is probable that the soil is capable of passing twice as much per

minute as the average percolation from rainfall in a day. Also, because irrigation
sewage works exist on gravel and other soils in which there are wells. The perco-
lative capacity under pressure bears on the yield of wells sunk in sands, &c, near

--to and remote from large bodies of water upon the surface.
     Temperature of Percolatio7i. The temperature of percolation has not been
observed. Changes of temperature in the soil must act upon the contained mois-
ture in the same way as they do in the air above, thereby tending to cause evapora-
tion or to produce percolation. In an abstract of more than 100,000 observations
upon the temperature of the soil made in the Gardens of the Royal Botanic
Society, London, 1871-1876, Mr. G. J. Seymour, F.R.S., shows that the heat wave
commences in March, and spreads downward till the whole 4 feet of observation

is warmer than the air in September and October ; the effect of the preceding cold
was disappearing at 4 feet by the end of August. In November the cold wave
commences and moves down till the whole 4 feet is colder than the air by the end
of February, when the heat wave begins again. This corresponds with the
division of Ebermayer on March 1 as regards the commencement of the heat wave
at the surface and the disappearance of the preceding heat wave at 4 feet ; and on
September 1 as regards the disappearance of the preceding cold wave at 4 feet,
but not as regards the surface, the heat wave lasting till the end of October. These
heat divisions correspond with the ' least rain ' periods of Glaisher which occur in
February and March, the last two months of the cold wave, and with the 'heaviest
rain ' periods which end with the heat wave at 3 inches in October ; with the
cessation of percolation in March (when the heat wave begins) and its recommence-
ment in November (when the cold wave begins).

     In reference to future observations on percolation, therefore, it is suggested

that :--

1. Artificial admixtures should be avoided.

2. The calibre of the constituent grains, and the percentage of grains of each

gauge in the natural admixture, should be experimentally ascertained.

3. The absolute capacity should be measured.

4. The retentive power should be proved.

5. The percolative capacity at saturation point, and as far as possible at less

degrees of humidity, should be measured.

6. The percolative capacities under pressure greater than that of saturation

should be proved.

--7. Percolators should contain thermometers.

There should be a set of three cylinders A, the saturated cylinder, filled with

saturated soil, closed top and bottom, and provided with a thermometer.

    B a common Dalton gauge, provided with thermometer.

    C the dry cylinder, filled with dry soil, closed top and bottom, and provided with

a thermometer.

The thermometers should be arranged back to back in the centre of each percolator

at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4 feet, and one at 3 inches and at the surface close to

them. Presumably the thermometers in the Dalton gauge would agree with those

in the dry gauge when the soil was dry, and with those in the saturated gauge
Wewhen the soil was saturated, as their difference would be noted.
                                                                       should then

have something more than wet-and-dry bulb thermometers in the soil and the

machinery for connecting observations on rainfall, temperature, and percolation, and

ibr comparing different series of observations at present wanting.

                      o. On Leon Francq's Fireless Locomotive.
                          By Mons. Charles Bergeron, C.E.

     Thejireless locomotive, described by Mons. Charles Bergeron, is an American
invention. It has been much improved by Mons. Leon Francq, civil engineer in

Paris, who studied the question of mechanical traction by means of steam engines
502 report-- 1879.

 without fire, that is to say, by means of hot water heated to a high temperature-
 by the injection of the steam into a body of water.

     He made a very successful application of his system on the line of tramways^

 between Rueil and Marly le Roi, near Paris, which is in a working order since'
 the month of July of the last year, and never failed nor gave any reason of
 complaint from the public.

      The principal object, namely, the suppression of the furnace of the locomotive, is
 obtained by the utilisation of the calorific capacity of water, by giving it a quantity
 of heat sufficient for the production of the steam necessary for the working of
 each machine during a good length of time. The means adopted consists in
 causing to pass into a volume of water contained in a closed reservoir placed
 on the locomotive, a current of steam at high pressure produced in a generator
 fixed at the departure station, and which - gives up its heat iu the ratio of its
 mixture with the water.

      The locomotive consists of a large cylindrical reservoir, surmounted by a
 dome in which the steam is accumulated, and supported by a frame to which
 are fixed all the mechanical movements similar to those of an ordinary loco-

 motive.

      The reservoir holds more than 700 gallons, about two tons of water, which,,

 introduced into the apparatus, should be heated to a very high temperature before

 the locomotive is put in motion. By the aid of a fixed generator, it is capable of
 producing steam at a pressure which may attain sixteen atmospheres (224 pounds

 per square inch), at a temperature of 203° Centigrade.

      The steam comes from the generator into the reservoir by a pipe forming
 a branch with another horizontal pipe placed near the bottom of the reservoir
 along all its length, closed at its two extremities, but pierced on its upper surface-
 with two lines of small holes.

      The steam rushing from the generator escapes through all the holes of that
 tube and brings the water of the reservoir to the desired conditions of temperature
 and pressure.

      The distribution of steam to the cylinders of the locomotive is not different'
 from similar machines except in its mode of working. The escaped steam is not
 used to increase the draught, as there is no fire; it forms no clouds of steam
 issuing from the chimney, and produces no noise in escaping.

      The escape is made into an air condenser, formed by a close cylinder traversed
 by more than 600 metallic tubes which are open at both ends, so that the ah may
 pass freely through them from end to end and keep them cool. The steam
 after its working is condensed into that cylinder, and the water falls into a,

 small tank placed under the foot-board of the driver.
      The principal apparatus of the tireless engine invented by Mons, Francq is the

 expansive regulator (detendeur), by which the steam is carried to the cylinders of
 the locomotive regularly and at the same pressure.

     That pressure may vary from three to eight atmospheres, according to the

 amount of resistance of the cars running on the tramways.
      The spring of a balance, similar to those used for safety valves on boilers, is

 applied for opening more or less the valve of admission of the steam into the
 exhaust regulator, and it acts so well that while the locomotive is in work the
 valve of admission oscillates in almost precise correspondence with the pulsations
even of the motive pistons.

      The traffic on Reuil and Marly Railway having been carried on by small
locomotives of the ordinary type previous to being worked by tireless engines,
affords an opportunity of making an exact comparison between them. In regard
to consumption of fuel, the account shows an important advantage in favour of
the tireless engine. The boiler of a locomotive is much more expensive on account
of its brass tubes in construction and in maintenance.

     The books of the company prove that the ordinary locomotive costs 41 francs
39 cents, and the tireless engine only 22 francs 77 cents, nearly the half, for a run

of 102 kilometres every day.

     The tubes in the boiler of the ordinary locomotive last six or seven years, and

the toiler requires expensive repairs frequently ; the reservoir of a fireless engine

will last thirty years, and will require hardly any repair.

    The tireless locomotive possesses all the elements of safety that can he required

in an engine intended to run in the streets of towns and along country roads.
     Explosion is impossible ; there is no firebox to be damaged ; no hot cinders can

be thrown into the fields. There is no firelight to alarm--no steam escaping from
valves, no whistle, nothing to frighten the most timid animal, as in ordinary
engines. There is no smoke ; neither the passengers nor the travellers on the road
can be annoyed by the sulphurous fumes of burning coke, or smothered with coal

smoke. There is no soot to blacken the linen and clothes of passengers, nor to
soil the carriages inside or out. There is no flame rising from the smoke pipe, or
hot cinders or ashes to burn passengers' clothes. There is no disagreeable smell of
burning coal or oil, and the traction is more easy and more pleasant than even that

of horses.

     Fireless locomotives have worked the traffic on the Eueil and Marly Kailway,

two tons of water when they start from Marly, where is the feeding boiler always

in fire. The steam in the reservoir is at a pressure of fifteen atmospheres at the

departure, and only four atmospheres, at the return, after a run there and back of

fifteen kilometres, nearly ten miles. The weight of steam drawn from the

reservoir for working the engine is only 200 kilogrammes (^ of its first volume).

It requires about twenty minutes to replace those 200 kilogrammes by the same

weight of steam drawn from the feeding boiler.

    When the pressure in the reservoir of the locomotive is the same as in the fixed
boiler, the engine is fit for working, and may wait several hours without a sensible

loss in the pressure of its steam.

    The engine can run with four or five tramway cars. The number of passengers

varies from 60 to 250 per train.
     These fireless locomotives have worked the traffic of the Eueil and Marly Rail-

way for more than one year. They run regularly at half-hour intervals from 6 a.m.

to 12 at night. The service has given general satisfaction to the passengers, to the
inhabitants along the line, and to the railway company. It may be concluded
therefore that the fireless locomotive of Mons. Francq is not only an elegant and
simple engine, but it possesses incontestable advantages in point of economy, and

probably will solve the important problem of a mechanical power applied to the

working of short lines of railway along roads and of tramways in towns.

scarcely a large town in the United Kingdom where this light has not been

publicly tried, in the illumination either of out-of-door spaces or streets, or of the

interior of public buildings or industrial works of various kinds. Since last year

many improvements have taken place, both in the machines for the generation of

the electric current, and also in the burners for utilising it. The actual require-

ments of practice, and especially the improved gas illumination in London and in

Paris, showed that electric lights of a more moderate illuminating power were

needed than were those afforded by the single-light machines of Siemens and of

Gramme. To the subdivision of the electric current for the production of an

increased number of light-centres of moderate illuminating power, and to a more

economical forni of burner, especially in the form of a ' candle ' instead of the more

delicate and expensive ' regulator,' has the attention of electricians been especially

directed.

In the type of * Gramme ' machine used so far with the Jablochkoff candles

both in France and in this country, two separate machines have been required ; an

' excitor                                        to generate the current, to be passed on to the  ' light '  machine for  sub-
                                              '

division into several distinct circuits. In the new form, though these two parts

are still separate, they compose but one machine ; which by a suitable arrangement

of the circuits may be made to support, with an expenditure of the same amount

of motive power, either the same number of lights as formerly, or, at will, the
number may be increased while luminosity of each is diminished, till the total
number of the light-centres is double that of the older machines ; while the aggre-

gate of the illuminating power remains about the same throughout. Thus, within

the writer's personal experience, a machine of the new type, which contained the

same amount of copper and iron as the old four-light machines, and absorbing

about the same amount of motive power, viz. 4| horse-power (net), could be made

to produce either four lights of nearly 600 candles each, or ten lights of about 240
Acandles.
                                                 larger machine of similar construction could, it was understood, feed,

either eight of the large, or twenty of the small lights, with an absorption of

rather under 10 horse-power. With the large lights, and the older type of machine

in use on the Thames Embankment, twenty lights require a net expenditure of

nearly 20 horse-power.

With the Lontin machine an improvement in the same direction has taken

place ; the six-light machine of last year now producing twenty-four lights, each

of illuminating power somewhat similar to the small-sized lights just referred to.

In the De Meritens machine a somewhat increased productive power is the result of

a considerable simplification, and consequent economy, in the form of the steel

magnets employed.

   A new form of generator has entered the lists in the Thermo-electric pile of

M. Sudre, erroneously called by some the Clamond, from a former pile of this

name. The ' Sudre ' pile is a cylindrical hot-air furnace placed vertically, having
on its outside two sets of small flues, formed in cast-iron chambers ; and outside of
these a series of electric chains hang vertically, and are composed of small cubes

of an alloy of zinc and antimony, connected with each other by strips of tin, while

exterior to the cubes, and radiating from them, are placed vertically, like the leaves

of an open book, thin sheets of copper. The hot air from the top of the furnace is

forced downwards through one set of chambers, and up again through the outer

set, heating in its passage the zinc cubes which are placed against the flue, a strip

of asbestos only intervening ; while the copper plates act as the distributors of the

heat so acquired ; the difference of temperature between the heated back of the

Azinc cubes and the outer edge of the copper plates being about 3 to 1.                                      double

pile of this construction, containing 3,000 zinc cubes or elements in each half, in

use in Paris for some months back, has a total electro-motive force of 218 volts,
which is equivalent to 120 Bunsen cells, and has a total resistance of 31 ohms.

This pile works two Serrin lamps very steadily and noiselessly, each giving a fair

Hmoderate-sized light. The fuel consumed with the pile is coke ; about hours

and 30 lbs. of coke being required to raise it to the required temperature, after

which 20 lbs. is the hourly consumption.

In electric burners, Messrs. Siemens have lately brought out a 'pendulum'

lamp, which differs very materially from their previous forms of regulator and
from others of the same class, by dispensing with a large amount of the clockwork.

In it the separation and approach of the carbons necessary for lighting is effected
by the in-and-out movement of a plunger within a solenoid ; the motions of the

plunger being communicated by means of a hinged frame to the upper carbon

Whenholder.  the motion of the plunger is not sufficient for the feed of the

carbons, the holder-rod, which has a rack on one face in its lower portion, becomes

detached from the frame, and continues its descent by gravity. The rate of

descent is, however, rendered regular by a pendulum fixed on the same shaft as the

toothed wheel fitting into the rack ; thus the descent of each tooth of the carbon-

holder rack corresponds to a beat of the pendidum.

Mr. 0. Heinricks has introduced a ' regulator,' which presents many points of
Adifference from the other lamps distinguished by that name.
                                                                  small case com-

pactly encloses the entire of the controlling apparatus, which acts upon a shaft

beneath, but entirely outside of it ; upon this shaft are placed the holders of the

two semi-circular carbons, which fall by gravity as required to a point immediately

beneath. By this arrangement the light is left free and unrestricted for projection

away from the lamp ; while the circular form of the carbon pencils permits of a
much greater duration of uninterrupted illumination than would be the case with
straight carbon-pencils, within the same space. The controlling mechanism

includes two distinct magnets and armatures ; one for the feed, the other for the

separation of the carbons. By an ingenious arrangement the alternate action of

these two magnets is made to control the approach of the carbons, which becomes
a step-by-step movement, instead of an unchecked continuous one. To this last are

ascribed, by some, many of the interruptions in the light, as well as the subsequent

hissings which are found to occur with the ordinary forms of ' regulator.'

Much attention has of late been directed to the more economical form of burner

termed ' candle,' from the two carbon-rods being placed side by side, and both
being consumed at the same rate. The only type in use twelve months ago was

the Jablochkoff candle. In its original form it possessed the disadvantages of

having the carbons rigidly fixed, so preventing any self-adaptation to the variations

of the strength of the electric current, and without any power of relighting itself

if once extinguished. This last property has since been acquired by the intro-

duction of some zinc filings into the insulating substance : an improvement which

does not appear, however, to be much made use of.

The De Meritens candle dispenses altogether with the insulating substance, and

its inconvenience of manufacture ; one, or even two, insulated carbon-rods taking

its place, and causing induced currents in them during the passage of the current
Afrom one outside main carbon to the other.
                                             form of ' candle ' known as the

Wilde, but first devised by Rapieff, is superior to the preceding ones in simplicity,

efficiency, and economy. In it the carbons are placed in two separate holders, one

fixed and the other responding to the movements of the armature of a magnet,

through which the current passes. The Jamin candle, about the merits of which

much has been said of late, has the two carbons fixed, without any insulating sub-

stance between them. The wire from one of the carbon holders, instead of passing

directly away, is before doing so wound vertically round the candle in the plane of

the two carbons, and at a distance of  about f inch from each of  them                         about  five
                                                                                            ;

turns are taken, each insulated from the other, and all formed into a single coil.

Heinricks has a candle with two pairs of semi-circular carbons, at right angles to

each other, and with an electro-magnet above controlling them.

To these improvements in the electrical apparatus themselves must be added

those in the delicate automatic governing gear of the engine-motors, both steam

and gas, in order to insure that extreme regularity of motion which is requisite

for electric illumination. Of these, in steam engines, among the most successful

are those of Ransomes, Sims, and Head, of Duvergier (of Lyons), of Robey, &c.

While in gas engines, the most extensively used, so far, is the ' Otto ' of Crossley

Brothers ; though L. Simon and Son, and also Clerk, have each more recently

introduced engines which present ingenious and novel features.

3. On the Changes of Volume in Iron when passing from the Liquid to the
   Solid State, and an Instrument for observing the same. By T. Wrightson,

   Memb. Inst. C.E., F.G.S.

     That there are some considerable changes in the density of iron in passing from
the solid to the liquid state, is best illustrated by observing the behaviour of a piece
of cold iron when thrown into a ladle of molten iron. After being thrown in, it rises
to the surface, and as it becomes heated continues rising out of the metal until a
considerable portion of its bulk is raised above the molten surface. It then
appears for a time to remain without further change of volume until it reaches the
melting point, when it rapidly subsides into the general mass.

     These phenomena appeared to the writer to be well worthy of examination ; the
more so because much has been written upon the apparent anomaly that, although
iron when cast in a mould contracts in all its lineal dimensions about one per cent.,
and should therefore, when cold, have a specific gravity higher than that of liquid
metal, it nevertheless floats on the surface when thrown into the molten iron.

      All kinds of ingenious explanations have been hazarded to account for this, but

no one appears to have taken the precaution to ascertain whether the anomaly was

real or only apparent.
      In order to exhibit the changes of specific gravity during the passage of the iron

from the solid to the liquid state, it occurred to the writer to submerge a ball of

cold iron in a vessel of molten iron to a certain depth, and to connect this ball
by means of a rod of refractory material to a spring balance ; any expansion or con-
traction of the ball woidd cause a greater or lesser displacement of the liquid iron,,
and the variation of buoyancy produced by this could be read off in ounces on the

index of the spring balance.

A spring balance, with a circular dial plate, was accordingly suspended on a
Awooden framing immediately above a large vessel of molten iron.
                                                                  rigid rod

weighing two or three pounds was fastened to the moving slide of the balance, and

to the end of this rod was attached the cast iron ball to be experimented upon.

Before fixing the ball, the position of the index of the balance was marked in pencil

on a sheet of paper, surrounding but not covering the circular face of the dial. The

ball then being attached, another pencil mark, farther round the dial, indicated the

whole weight of the ball and rod, and one indication subtracted from the other re-

presented the actual weight of the ball.

    Now if the specific gravity of the cold ball were exactly the same as that of the

hot metal, there would be no tendency when the ball was lowered into the metal

either to sink or swim, and in that case the pointer would travel back exactly to
the mark, showing the weight of the rod alone. If the ball were of higher spe-
cific gravity there would be a sinking effect which would prevent the pointer

arriving at this mark, the space it fell short representing this sinking effect. As the
ball expanded in volume it would displace more liquid metal, producing an upward

notation equal to the difference between the weight of the ball and the weight of
the fluid displaced, and which, so long as the ball continues of the same weight and

is not allowed to rise to the surface, can be read off in ounces on the dial plate

while the operation proceeds.

    By carrying out this plan the author obtained an exact register of the succes-

sive alterations in volume taking place in the ball, though hidden from sight below

the surface of the metal.

     Immediately the ball was immersed and held two inches below the surface,
an assistant called out intervals of seconds, while the writer marked on the paper
round the dial plate the corresponding positions as the movement of the pointer
took place. After obtaining indications of various sizes of ball, the results were
laid down graphically.

    In the diagrams thus obtained we have a complete record of the changes in

volume and specific gravity from the cold solid to the commencement of the molten

state.

    An examination of the results obtained shows that in all cases there is

a sinking effect when the ball is first submerged ; in a few seconds this disappears
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  507

and gives way to a floating effect. From this it appears evident that cold cast
iron sinks when first put in a bath of molten iron, and that therefore its specific

gravity is higher than that of the liquid metal, and that its rapid expansion dis-
placing the liquid metal, and causing it so quickly to come to the surface, has led
to the widespread but erroneous belief in the anomaly described. This has been
proved by the writer in a more direct way, by making a number of spheres of cast
iron, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 inches in diameter. These when cold were lowered (not
thrown) into the molten iron by means of a bent iron fork, the ball resting freely
on the two prongs of the same.

     In every case the ball went down with the fork, rested under the metal for a
few seconds, and then rose to the surface, the experiments being confirmatory of

the results obtained with the apparatus already described.
     The diagrams also show that the line showing change of volume continues to

rise in a somewhat irregular curve until it reaches its maximum above the line

of equilibrium. The further increase of heat then appears to have little effect in

changing the volume of the ball, as the line of volume remains in its maximum
position until melting commences, when the ball rapidly subsides.

    The table accompanying this shows the maximum variations of sinking or float-

ing effect in percentages of the actual weight of the balls, also the actual floating

or sinking effect in ounces avoirdupois.

The experiments were made on the Brighton Railway, with the assistance of

Mr. George Westinghouse, with a special four-wheeled Tan constructed for the

purpose                                        it was  attached  to an engine, and  was  run at various  speeds,  during
                                           _;

which time various forces were measured by self-recording dynamometers. The

principle of these dynamometers is that the force to he measured acts on a piston

fitting in a cylinder full of water, and the pressure of the water is measured by a

Richards indicator connected by a pipe to the cylinder ; thus, as the drum of the

indicator revolves, diagrams are obtained, giving the force acting on the piston.

The advantages of this method are obvious, because the indicator can be placed at

any convenient point, and the inertia of the water tends to make the pencil keep a

Aposition corresponding to the mean force.                                          detailed description of the construc-

tion of the dynamometers was given to the Section last year, and on this occasion

the results arrived at alone will be stated.

     In most of the experiments the tyres were of steel, and the brake-blocks of cast

iron. Some experiments were made with wrought iron blocks, but the results were

not uniform or satisfactory.

It will suffice here to give the general results arrived at.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  509

      It is convenient in looking at the question of railway-brakes to consider first,

what is the operation of a brake ?

   A train, through the adhesion of the wheels of the locomotive acting on the

rails, slowly accumulates energy, and for each ton of weight in the train the
accumulated energy is equal to 120 foot-tons at 60 miles per hour, 53 foot-tons at
40 miles per hour, and 30 foot-tons at 20 miles per hour. Thus, for a train of
fifteen vehicles, weighing 200 tons, the energy at 60 miles per hour is equal to

24,000 tons falling a distance of one foot.

    After a train has attained the desired speed, the reasons for stopping it may be

of two kinds : (1) at prearranged places for convenience ; and (2) for the pre-

vention of accidents or for mitigating the consequences if accidents are unavoidable.

     To stop a train for the first reason requires but a limited amount of force, which
may be applied in any crude manner.

     For the prevention of accidents, however, there is required :
     a. The instantaneous application of the greatest possible amount of retarding

force.

    b. The continuous action of this force until the momentum of the train is

destroyed.

                                                                                                                        iSSec.

     The retarding force used in practice is that due to the friction resulting from
the forcible application of pieces of metals or wood (brake-blocks) to the tyres of
the wheels ; this friction impedes the rotation of the wheels, and tends, through the
adhesion of the wheels to the rails, to destroy the energy stored in the train. The
retarding force is therefore limited to the resistance obtainable between the wheels
and rails.

     It was at first customary to attach to a train, for purposes of retardation, a
certain number of vehicles with extra weight, to which the brakes were applied
but since the question of retardation has become better understood, brakes have
been applied to every vehicle, the means of applying these brakes being placed in
the hands of both the engine-driver and the guard. The reason for this is that the

maximum amount of retarding force can be obtained only by applying brake-blocks

to every wheel in the train, each block being pressed with sufficient force to pro-
duce a resistance to the rotation of the wheel just equal to the greatest possible
friction between the wheel and the rail. This greatest possible friction occurs

when the adhesion of the wheel to the rail is just about to be overcome by the
superior effort of the brake-blocks, which effort, if further increased, immediately
begins to stop the rotating movement of the wheel, and thus causes it to slide
--510 EEPORT 1879.

upon the rail. The experiments were made with the object of measuring the force

thus brought into action.

     The first result of the experiment was to show conclusively that the retarding
effect of a wheel sliding upon a rail is much less than when braked with such a
force as would just allow it to continue to revolve.

     The annexed copies of two sets of diagrams (No. 1 and No. 2) taken during
the experiments, show, more clearly than can be explained, the difference in the
retarding force, before the wheels begin to slide upon the rails, and after. These

vertical height of f or/, according to scale b, multiplied by 60, gives the retarda-
tion in pounds. It will be seen that the stop was made in half the time with the
wheels braked but not skidded of that required when the wheels were skidded.

    The accompanying diagram 3 shows in another way the comparative retarding
effect of the brakes when acting on the revolving wheels, and when applied with

sufficient force to skid the wheels.

    An experiment was made by keeping the van at a uniform speed on a rising

gradient of 1 in 264--the strain on the draw-bar being also measured during the

experiment. In this case the strain on the draw-bar diminished in the same ratio

as the friction.

     From this it is evident that the retardation which arises when the wheel is
sliding on the rail is far less than the retardation produced by the effect of the
brake-blocks when applied to the wheels so as to allow the wheels to continue

revolving;.

      In order to understand this it is necessary to consider the general action of

railway brakes. When a train is moving at a given velocity the adhesion of the

wheels on the rails causes them to revolve ; every point on the surface of the tyre
moves round at the same rate as that at which the train itself is moving forward
but every such point in relation to the forward movement of the train comes suc-

cessively to rest at the moment when it comes in contact with the rail. Now when

the brake is applied with a slight pressure only, the wheel continues to move round
at the same rate as that at which the train is moving, but it moves with more
difficulty, and this increased difficulty in moving is shown either by an increase
in the tractive force required to keep up the forward motion, or, in cases where the
accelerating force is not kept up, by the tendency of the moving mass to come to
rest in a shorter time than would otherwise be the case. But if the pressure

with which the brake is applied be increased, a point is reached when the friction
between the brake-block and the wheel first approaches, then equals, and finally

exceeds, the adhesion of the wheel on the rail. When this happens, the wheel

first begins to revolve more slowly, and then ceases to revolve and slides along the
rail, or, as it is usually termed, is skidded. The retardation is then no longer due to
the friction between the brake-block and the tyre of the wheel ; but the vehicle is
transformed for the time from a vehicle on wheels into a sledge, and the retarda-
tion is due to the excess of resistance which is produced by making the vehicle
slide along the rails over that produced by making the vehicle move forward on
wheels revolving freely.

    The reason why the retardation caused by the brake-blocks applied to revolving

wheels exceeds that caused by the skidded wheels became obvious from the fact
next discovered, viz., that the coefficient of friction between the brake-blocks and

the wheels varied inversely according to the speed of the train, a higher propor-
tionate percentage of brake-block pressure being required to obtain a given amount

of friction at high speeds, and a lower pressure at lower speeds.

      This is illustrated by the diagrams 4, 5. In these diagrams p represents pres-
sure, f friction, and s speed, measured on the respective scales at the side, to be
corrected by the multiple before mentioned. It will be observed that the ratio of

although this irregularity may not be distinctly visible to the naked eye. These

surfaces, if examined under a sufficiently strong microscope, would be found to be
somewhat as represented in the accompanying diagram, No. 9.

     If the upper body be moved in the direction of the arrow, s, by a force, p, the
point, a, of the upper surface would mount the incline, formed by the corresponding

portion of the lower body, until

it reached its summit at a'; from
this moment it would begin to

descend the next incline, from a*

to 6 ; provided the force, p, acting
in the direction of the arrow, s,

would leave it time to do so. The
incline from b to c would have to
be mounted next, causing a cer-
tain amount of resistance during
the time the body traversed the
distance d c. But if we increase

the speed in the direction of the

dart s, so that the body will re-

quire less time to traverse a' d than
to fall through d b, in such case a' would not arrive at b, but at some other point,

VV, and then only the portion of the incline c would have to be mounted, pre-

senting a smaller amoimt of resistance than in the former case. This illustrates
what occurs.

     The fact that the coefficient of friction diminishes with speed sufficiently ex-

plains why a skidded wheel affords less resistance than one which still rotates,

because the resistance occasioned by the rotating wheel is only limited by the
adhesion of the wheel on the rail, and this, as already shown, is the same as static
friction, since the point of the wheel is stationary as regards the forward movement
of the train at the moment it touches the rail ; whilst when the wheel is skidded
and slides, the friction is that due to the speed at which the wheel moves on the
rail, and is therefore less than the other.

     Some special experiments were made with blocks of small area. The brake-
blocks generally used in these experiments were 12 inches long, by 3 inches wide,
giving a surface of 36 square inches ; the small brake-blocks were made so as to
afford a surface of pressure against the wheel of only one-third of this amount, or 12
 square inches, thus making the pressure per square inch three times as great as
before. The diminution of surface was obtained by casting projections upon the
face of the block. The author is not prepared to say that any greater coefficient
of friction was obtained by the extra pressure per square inch, although in one of

 the experiments, at a velocity of sixty miles an hour, the rotation of the wheels
 was arrested by these blocks, whilst this effect had not been produced at that speed
in other experiments. The experiments on this form of block were stopped because

 the blocks were entirely worn down in the course of about twelve experiments.
      Mr. Rennie showed * that high pressures per square inch produced a greater co-

 efficient of friction between surfaces either moving very slowly or nearly at rest
 but it must be borne in mind that the author's experiments were made with high
 velocities, whereby a serious element of disturbance is introduced, viz., the grinding
 away of the surface ; and it is, therefore, probable that the increase in the co-
 efficient of friction due to increased pressure, may have been neutralised by the
 lubricating effect of the fine particles ground off the surfaces.

       While no certain opinion can be expressed as to the relation which the co-

 efficient of friction bears to pressure, so far as these experiments are concerned, it

 is quite clear that in proportion as the pressure is increased or diminished, so will

 the actual friction obtained be increased or diminished. When the friction which

 exists between the brake-blocks and the wheel reaches a certain point, the wheel

 ceases to rotate, and becomes fixed. This point is reached when the frictional

resistance of the blocks exceeds the adhesion between the wheel and the rail if the

speed is kept up ; or, if the speed is slackening, when it exceeds the adhesion

between the wheel and the rail, plus the effort required to retard the rotation of
the wheel equally with the retardation of the train ; and the excess of resistance

then acts as an unbalanced force, tending to destroy the momentum of the wheel.
     Usually there are in a train a certain number of vehicles braked and a certain

number unbraked. If the brakes acted on all the wheels, then the rotating momen-
tum of the wheels does not add to the distance in stopping a train, because that
momentum can be acted upon by the brakes directly, without in any way affecting
the adhesion of the wheels to the rails. It simply requires an additional amount of

brake-block pressure.

    With the unbraked portion of a train the rotating momentum of the wheels is
an addition to the momentum due to the weight of the train (including therein the

actual weight of the wheels), which cannot be utilised for retardation; and it
is therefore important that there should be brakes on every wheel of a train.

    As it is the adhesion which governs the retardation which the brake-blocks can

exert upon wheels, it is manifest that the pressure brought to act on the brake-

blocks should never give an amount of friction which exceeds the adhesion. At a

high speed, however, the pressure required to produce a degree of friction equal to

the adhesion is much greater than what is required at a low speed.
     The following table gives approximately the proportion which the pressure to

be applied to the brake-blocks should bear to the weight upon the braked wheels,
with coefficients of adhesion between wheel and rail, varying from - 30 to "15 of
the weight on the wheels

sequently, the retarding effect of the brakes would be greatly increased, were means
devised for placing sand under every wheel to which a brake is applied, during the

progress of a stop.

     The effect in stopping a train is greatest when the friction between the brake-
blocks and the wheels amounts to a quantity just short of the resistance caused by

the adhesion, because as soon as the brake-block friction exceeds the adhesion, the
wheel becomes fixed and begins to slide. In order, however, to secure the best
results in stopping, it is obviously necessary that the brake-block pressure should be
regulated to give a friction about equal to the adhesion of the wheels at every
stage during the progress of a stop.

     There is no reason why, in the progress of mechanical science, these conditions
should not be regulated by a self-acting arrangement.

    As the adhesion varies it is necessary to consider what amount of adhesion for

purposes of retardation can be safely calculated upon.

     The following table shows the distances required to stop a train on a level line
from a speed of fifty miles per hour, with a retarding force of from 5 to 30 per
cent, of the total weight of the train :

sumed in overcoming the momentum of the braked wheels, and the extra distance

run by the train in consequence of the momentum of the unbraked wheels.

From the experiments it was found that the best results were obtained in cases

where the pressure applied at first was from about If to twice the weight on the

wheels, and where the reduction of the pressure was effected with sufficient

rapidity towards the end of the stop to prevent the friction increasing at a sufficient

rate to skid the wheels.

The necessity for the instantaneous application of the maximum brake-block

pressure throughout the train is evident from the fact that, at a speed which is

frequently obtained, namely, sixty miles per hour, a train passes over 88 feet each

second                             therefore  the  loss of  two  or  three  seconds  in  applying  the brakes means
                                ;

often the difference between safety and danger, and the rapidity of a stop largely
depends upon the rapidity with which all the brake-blocks can be brought to act

against the wheels of a train.

This points to the advantage of being able to move the brake-blocks with great

rapidity from their position of inaction to that of contact with the wheels ; because

it is essential to provide that the brake-blocks, when out of use, shall be removed

to a distance from the wheels sufficient to prevent the possibility of their dragging

against the wheels, and thus retard the progress of the train. The question of the
rapidity with which brakes can be applied in practice is thus one of much

importance.

     Some experiments were made in October 1878, upon the North Eastern
Railway, on a train fitted with the vacuum brake, and one fitted with the Westing-
house brake, to ascertain the time which was required after moving the brake-

handle to set the brakes with various degrees of force in different parts of the train.
The following table shows the result arrived at :

France showed that the pressure commenced to be brought on in one second at the

farthest carriage, and was fully one in two and a half seconds from the time of first

moving the brake lever.

The importance of simultaneous action of the brakes in every part of a train

arises from the fact that the train is not a rigid mass, but is made up of separate

vehicles connected by means of spring draw-bars and buffers. The length of the

train can thus be modified to a certain extent by the degree of compression of

these springs. In a recent experiment on the North-Eastern Railway the train

consisted of twenty-four carriages, and the whole extent to which the buffers could

Abe compressed amounted to 35 feet.                                 train travelling at sixty miles an hour

moves at 88 feet in a second. If the brakes act on the front part of the train

before they affect the hind part the speed of the front carriages may be diminished

by 10 to 15 feet in a second, whilst the hind part moves on with undiminished

speed ; thus the hind part may press against the front part with a force of from 10

to 15 foot-tons for every ton weight of the hind vehicles. The buffer springs

would be compressed by this force and remain so till the brakes acted equally on

all the wheels, when a reaction of the buffer springs would take place ; this reaction

creates the violent jerks often felt with continuous brakes, and occasionally results

in fractures of couplings and draw-bars. In a perfect brake the application would

be instantaneous, and simultaneous on all the wheels of a train.

     It is beyond the scope of this paper to enter fully into the merits of different

kinds of brakes, but it may be convenient to sum up what seem to be the require-

ments of a perfect brake.

1. It should be fitted to act upon each wheel of the engine, tender, and every

other vehicle in a train of any length. The brake-blocks, when out of action,

must be kept a certain distance away from the wheels, in order to prevent any

liability to drag against the wheels; and this distance, after being once adjusted,

gradually increases by the wear of the blocks, and often exceeds three-quarters of

an inch                                while the springing of  the  brake-gear under great  strain also adds to the
                                    ;

extent of movement required in the brake force before the blocks are fully applied.

Hence the brake-gear should be so adjusted as to be capable of moving the brake-

blocks instantaneously through a space of one inch.

    2. However brought into action, it should be capable of exerting upon the

blocks of each pair of wheels, within two seconds, a force of twice, or at the very

least one-and-three-quarter times, the load on those wheels.
     3. The brake-block pressure acting on each wheel should be regulated so that

the friction between the brake-block and the wheel may always be limited so as

not to exceed the adhesion between the wheel and the rail ; by which means it will

produce the maximum effect at each moment of its application.

     4. The brake-block pressure should be capable of being applied by engine-driver

or by guards.

    5. The engine, tender, and vehicles should each carry its own store of brake-

power, which should be independent of the brake-power on any other vehicle.
     6. The brake-block pressure should be automatically applied to every vehicle

by the separation of the train into two or more parts, and it should also be applied
by the act of the wheels of any carriage leaving the rails.

     7. The brake-block pressure should be automatically applied by such failure of

the connections or appliances as would render it afterwards incapable of application

until the failure had been remedied.

8. The brake-block pressure should be capable of application with any degree

of force up to the maximum, and it should be capable of continued action on

inclines, or of repeated applications at short intervals at junctions and stations.

In addition to these requirements, the questions of cost, durability, convenience

in operation, and other essential points, will of course come under consideration.
     The experiments which have been here described were made on trains travelling

under conditions which were necessarily continually varying, both in respect of the

condition of the rails and other matters ; and they therefore contained many
elements beyond the reach of calculation. It is hoped that some opportunity may

arise, ere long, for resuming experiments on friction at high velocities under
520 report-- 1879.

conditions from which these elements of disturbance may be eliminated. Meanwhile

it is evident that a continuous brake, capable of being applied simultaneously to

every wheel of a train under the conditions which have been enumerated in this
memorandum, is a much more practical and scientific method of bringing a train to

rest than the old plan of concentrating the brake-power in two or three heavy

brake vans placed in different parts of the train, and leaving the rest of the wheels

without brakes.

The advantage which thus evidently ensues from utilising the adhesion of every

wheel of a train for the purpose of stopping a train suggests the further con-

sideration as to whether it would not be a more scientific arrangement, as well as
more economical in regard to the permanent way of railways, to utilise the adhesion

of every wheel of a train for causing the train to move forward, instead of

depending for the moving force upon the adhesion of one heavy vehicle alone, viz.,

the locomotive. Experiments connected with the action of brakes on railway

trains  require very delicate                                                               apparatus                                                 the  credit of the  design of the  apparatus

        6. Gowper's Writing Telegraph. By E. A. Cowper, O.E.

The inventor described the details of the construction of his writing telegraph,

and the mode in which a pen at a distant station was made to write freely, as the

operator at the sending station wrote with a pencil at the sending instrument. He

explained the necessity that existed for causing the two currents of electricity that

conveyed the power to the distant station to increase or decrease steadily and

gradually, without any sudden large increase or decrease of resistance being

opposed to  such currents                                                                   the construction of the                                                 necessary  resistances  being
                                                                                         ;

practically that of one very long thin German silver wire, having 32 thin metal

plates soldered to it, at the proper intervals (varying greatly), such plates being

all brought very close together, with insulating sheets of paraffined paper

between them, so that a contact rod in connection with a battery, with a small

knob or projection on it, could slide over the tops of the plates, and make contact

with  each  one  in  succession                                                             making                                                    contact with  one before it  left another, so
                                                                     ;

that the small resistance due to the length of wire between two plates was all

that was added each time that the projection passed from one plate to another.

Then two such contact rods, jointed to the pencil of the operator, and placed at

right angles to one another, worked over the tops of two separate sets of contact

plates, each set affecting one line wire, so as to give (so to speak) latitude and

longitude of the pencil of the operator at all times.

The quick action or perfect response of the needles at the receiving instrument,

which directly controlled the writing pen, was obtained by using exceedingly thin

soft iron plates, both for the needles and for the magnets which affect the needles,

so as on the one hand to have the least possible amount of momentum and vis

inertia in the needles, and the least possible residuary magnetism in the magnets.

The needles were slightly curved in their section to stiffen them, their thickness

being only j±- inch, and were mounted on polished hard steel bearings, in the

manner adopted for the balance wheels of watches when jewelled, and were thus

exceedingly free and lively, as a very small amount of friction or weight in this

part of the instrument would be fatal to good writing. The power of the needles

was insured by fixed flat coils that surrounded them, brought into action by a local

battery, whilst the two fine wires were coiled around the fixed magnets that

affected the needles, and attracted them more or less, as the strength of the

currents varied. Then the needles being at right angles to each other pulled the

pen in the two directions, vertically and horizontally, and also pulled against two

light springs, so that the pen took exactly the varying positions due to the varying
strength of the currents, which again depended upon the position of the pencil of

the operator.

     The paper on which the operator wrote, and the paper on which the pen wrote
at the opposite end of the line, both moved along by clockwork, so as to write a
long continuous message or telegram.

The following Papers were read :

1. On the Proposed Canal Across the Isthmus of Panama.
              By Captain Bedford Pim, B.N., M.P.

The author said the whole world agreed that the accomplishment of inter-

oceanic canalisation of the Isthmus of Central America was only a question

of time. No one disputes the possibility of making such a canal, and it was

generally acknowledged that it might be made a paying concern. The congress

on inter-oceanic canalisation did not deal practically with the subject, and the

enthusiasm, which was so important an element in the greatness of the French

people, blinded those who took part in the congress to the magnitude and

the difficulties of the task, and to the fact that the work already done by M. Les-

seps bore about the same relation to the proposed Panama Canal that a small

tunnel on the northern of France would to that of the Mont Cenis. The physical

geography of the Bay of Panama was never taken into consideration, and he was

bound to say that the vote in favour of a canal parallel to the Panama Railway was

due rather to a personal feeling than to any capability possessed by the route selected.

In fact it was rumoured that the process known by our cousins across the Atlantic

as ' lobbying ' was by no means neglected on this occasion ; it was not therefore

surprising that the American representatives expressed their feelings in terms of

the strongest, and, not content with that, made anything but a favourable report
to their own Government. It was not alone the physical difficulty of the under-

taking, or even its cost, to which attention should be given. The choice of a

--route depended upon far more important considerations than those the terminal
Aports or harbours for instance.
                                  still more important feature was the physical

geography of the sea in the neighbourhood of the ports, for if sailing ships would

be able freely to enter and depart, the success of the undertaking was secured. At

least half of England's 21,000 sailing ships would use the canal, but if nature

placed an irresistible barrier to the approach of those ships a deep shadow would

be cast upon the future outlook of the undertaking. Commodore Maury had said

' that if nature, by one of her convidsions, should rend the Continent of America

in twain, and make a channel across the Isthmus of Panama or Darien as deep,

as wide, and as free as the Straits of Dover, it would never become a commercial

thoroughfare for sailing vessels,' and he endorsed that opinion, for of all parts of

the world the calms in the Bay of Panama were the most vexatious and endur-

ing. It therefore became the duty of a Central American canal projector to

avoid that locality, and, relying upon Commodore Maury, the route from the At-

lantic by way of the magnificent Nicaragua lakes to the harbour of Realejo seemed

that which was adapted for the required purpose, for it would be quite impossible

to exaggerate the money value of having a fair start and approach by means of

the little monsoons which blow on that coast. The great difficulty to be over-
come in the construction of a canal across Nicaragua was the making and main-

taining the harbour of Greytown on its Atlantic terminus, as a strong norther was
522 eeport-- 1879.

sufficient to close it, while a high river -would re-open an entrance. He thought

the cost of the enterprise would paralyse the enterprise, and he would suggest an

alternative route parallel to the river San Juan, with a canal of very different

dimensions, and cost to, that at present contemplated. Starting from Monkey

Point, now called Pirn's Bay, forty miles north of Greytown, he would cut a canal

from the inner part of that hay down to the Rama river, a distance of some nine
miles. The Rama river itself carried deep water some twenty miles into the in-

terior, and the remaining seventy miles to the lake of Nicaragua would traverse

land offering no particular difficulty. From San Miguelito on Lake Nicaragua hy

way of Tipitapa to the northern shores of Lake Nicaragua there was nothing

which an engineer would consider a difficulty, and the remainder of the canal to

Port Realego could scarcely he said to afford any field for engineering skill. In

Athat scheme a deep water canal was not even contemplated.  depth of eight

feet would he amply sufficient, the vessels heing transported on pontoons, such as

had heen successfully used in the Victoria Dock for some years; whilst the

canal could always he deepened, if desirahle, out of profits. Such a plan would

considerably reduce the cost, while other advantages would he gained, such as

cleaning the ship's bottom while on the pontoon, which would effect a saving to

owners almost if not quite sufficient to pay the canal dues. The canal would not

cost more than ten millions. If England and America would join hands and each

guarantee 1^ per cent, on that amount, there would be a joint guarantee of 3 per

cent., an inducement sufficient for English investors alone to take up the sum in less

than a week. What was 1^ per cent, on ten millions ? 150,0002. a year ; a sum

annually wasted on any vote of the navy estimates exceeding one million. And

Awhat did we get for our money ?  consolidation of the friendly feeling between

this country and the United States far more lasting and binding than could be

effected by any treaty between the two nations merely guaranteeing the neutrality

of the route. The representative of the American Government at the Paris con-

gress left no room for doubt as to the line of canal preferred by his Government,

and clearly and unmistakably pointed to Nicaragua as the best. He (Captain Pirn)

trusted the Government of this country would not for the sake of saving the

contribution of 150,000/. for a few years find themselves ultimately compelled to

purchase an interest in the new highway at any price which might then be de-
manded. He most earnestly hoped that the day would not be far distant when
we should see the completion of this great work of inter-oceanic canalisation

across Central America. He believed such an undertaking would give a beneficial

stimulus to the commerce of the United Kingdom, nay of the whole world, and

consequently could not fail to he a great and common boon to mankind.

             2. Cowper's Hot Blast Stoves. By E. A. Cowpee, C.E.

    Mr. Cowper described the improvements introduced in recent years for heating the
blast for blowing blast furnaces by a more perfect application of the regenerative sys-
tem, by which the waste gases from the top of the blast furnace, when in a state of
perfect combustion in the hot blast stove (during the time of heating it) were dis-
tributed in a more perfect manner than heretofore, so that the hot products of com-
bustion were caused to heat the whole area of the regenerator in an equal manner, the
result being a large increase in the power of the stove, as well as a saving of time

in the heating. By the improved combustion of the gases, a higher degree of

temperature was produced in practice and a higher temperature of blast was

realised, whilst the products of combustion finally left the stove at a lower

temperature, so that economy of gas followed as a consequence. Upwards of 110
stoves were now at work in England, France, Switzerland, and America, giving
perfect satisfaction and realising an economy in fuel of 20 to 30 per cent., whilst
20 per cent, more iron was made from the same plant, of furnace, blowing engine,
and boilers.

3. On the details of an [Experiment made to Ascertain the Causes of the

      difference between the Quantity of Seat in Fuel, and the Quantity which

     is Utilised in the Work done by a Steam Engine. By Emeeson

     Bainbridge, Assoc. H.C.E.

    The engines of H.M.S. Briton have been represented as types of the most econo-
mically worked steam engines of modern times, and the percentage of heat used
in doing work in the case of these engines, as recorded by Mr. Bramwell, was

ll'l per cent. ; that is, the indicated power of the engines showed a utilisation of
11T per cent, of the units of heat contained in the fuel used, this being equivalent

to a consumption of 1*8 lbs. of coal per horse-power per hour. If this figure

represent the highest result obtained, it will be readily understood how much

lower the actual average of utilised power in steam engines constructed and worked
in the usual way will be. The difference between 11 per cent, as the proportion of

heat utilised which has been proved to be possible, and 5 per cent, which may

be, at the most, the average actual percentage utilised in the working of steam
engines, suggests a wide field for inquiry and improvement. But a more difficult

subject for examination is presented by the difference between such 11 per cent,
and the actual heat-power contained by fuel, which is, of course, represented by
the figure 100, and whilst a large proportion of the great loss represented by the

non-utilisation of such a difference can never be overcome, the importance of the
inquiry is evidenced by the fact that every one per cent, gained, means, over the
consumption of this country alone, a saving of several millions of tons of coal per
annum.

The result above referred to shows the percentage utilised as proved by the

indicating of the cylinders of engines, but does not give the percentage repre-

sented by the work done. In the case which the writer now records he has

endeavoured to work out the details of the distribution of the heat of fuel in

various stages, commencing at its combustion under a boiler, and ending at the actual

useful work done by the engine, worked out to units of heat.

Of the total annual output of coal in this country the quantity actually used

in the production of steam amounts to about 50 millions of tons, or about 37

per cent, of the whole output, and it is with this appropriation of fuel this paper

has specially to deal.

 The       experiment above referred to was made with the Winding engine and

_

boilers of a small Colliery, such plant being nearly thirty years old, and situated

about two miles from Sheffield. This pit is 458 feet deep, and the Coals &c.

are raised by a direct-acting Winding engine, to which steam is supplied from

two boilers.

     During the time of observations, which extended from July 28 to August 2, in
all 184 - 5 hours, the following observations were carefully taken :

     1. The quality of coal used was the same throughout, and was carefully

weighed.

     2. The amount of ash and clinker produced was observed.
     3. The quantity of water passed into the boiler was ascertained by a tested

water-meter.

     4. The total number of the revolutions of the engine during the whole period
was taken by a counter, the work done by the engine being in each case recorded.

     5. Observations were taken of the temperature of the feed water.
     6. Observations were taken of the temperature of the outside air.

     7. Observations were taken of the temperature of the gases escaping to the

            _

chimney.

8. Observations were taken of the temperature of the outside of the boiler

covering.

     9. Observations were also taken of the temperature of the covering on the out-
side of the cylinders and steam pipes.

which was recorded by an anemometer.

     Although the experiments extended in all 184-5 hours, the time occupied by
the engine in actual work did not exceed nine hours per day.

    The most interesting results of the experiments may be briefly enumerated as-

follows :

     1. Only 20 per cent, of the fuel used was utilised in the evaporation of water,
and no less than 37 per cent, of the heat in such fuel is not accounted for.

     2. Only 3 per cent, of the heat expended in evaporating water is utilised in
actual useful work done, and thus of the 15 per cent, which was available for
work, £tk (3 per cent.) was actually utilised in the cylinder of the engine.

     3. Instead of 11-1 per cent, of heat employed being utilised, as found by indi-
cations from an engine of the best type, the utilised heat in the case referred to
only amounts to -69 per cent., or T\th of the result obtained in a first-class engine.

     4. The fact that at least 41 per cent, of the total heat is found to have gone up
the chimney, when if the coal had been properly consumed, probably not more
than 20 per cent, would have been lost in this direction, illustrates the manner in
which a great loss may take place when the ingress of air and the mode of fixing

the boiler are not properly looked to.

     5. The power exerted in moving the dead useless load upon the engine re-
presents 40 per cent, of the total power, as shown by the indicator diagrams.

     It is to be feared that the results of the working of the engine and boilers in
question are typical of the conditions under which a large number of engines in
this country are worked; and although the remarkable waste shown by the

series of experiments recorded cannot but suggest the idea of badly arranged plant,

the author ventures to submit that the tests are of value in pointing out the

importance of such tests being made more frequently, and the extra worth they
have when they extend over so long a period (including working and idle time)
as 184-5 hours. Had an experiment been made only for a few hours, there is no
doubt that a much better result would have been obtained, and this has been proved
by the author in this case. In making experiments of this description, the very
best form of instruments is required ; and if such instruments were in the
hands of a careful observer for carrying out a series of tests on a more com-
plete scale than the anthor has been able to arrange, he would not fail to
render good service to engineering knowledge.

     The author, however, thinks it right to add that in another arrangement of
plant at the Nunnery Colliery, which is to be visited by the members on the
29th instant, very different results from those recorded have been arrived at
in tests made with well-arranged boilers, and he ventures, by way of comparison,

to refer to these tests.

in working cost must of course be first considered, and in the adoption of all such

means of promoting economy as have been referred to it may be confidently as-

serted that the saving in working cost which will be effected by the economy of
fuel resulting from the adoption of such appliances as have been mentioned, will
as a rule wipe off the extra first cost incurred by such appliances in a very short
period, since the saving effected will probably vary from 50 to 150 per cent, per
annum on the first cost.

                        A POPULAR COMMENTARY.

The Student 's Edition of the Speaker s

      Commentary on the Holy Bible.

           Abridged and Edited by JOHN M. FULLER, M.A.

                              Vicar of Bexley, formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

                    To be completed in 6 Volumes. Vol. I. Crown Svo. Js. 6J.

    The Speaker's Commentary on the Bible has secured for itself a recognized place as the
foremost work of its class available for English readers. Numerous testimonies to the merits
of this work, and to the fact that it meets a real want in religious literature, have been
received from various countries and different schools of thought. America and Germany,
Churchmen and Nonconformists, clergymen and laymen, have alike found in its pages wise
and liberal views upon points of confessedly disputed interpretation, and a storehouse of
scholarship and research upon questions philosophical, archaeological, and historical.

    The object of the present Abridgment is to give information sufficient to enable any reader
to understand the Holy Scriptures, "to acquaint him with the conclusions of learned investiga-
tions, and to supply him with satisfactory answers to current misinterpretations.

     · · Lady Anne Blunt is entitled by descent to be an authoress, since she is the grand-daughter
of Lord Byron. Having previously explored the Sahara south of the Atlas range, she spent
last winter with her husband among the wandering Arabs of the Syrian desert. Admitted by

their hosts to the privileges, not only of hospitality but of sworn brotherhood, the travellers
lived with them in their tents, moved with their encampments, and were even spectators of
some of their feuds and strifes. Although the chief tribes were in arms, and \\ ar was raging
in the desert at the time, the English visitors were honoured as friends and admitted to all the
privacies of tent life." Athoncum.

History of Egypt under the Pharaohs.

    The History of Egypt now offered to the English reader is distinct from the long train of
able and interesting works which, in opening to the last and the present generations the life
and story of the Old Egyptians, as by a new revelation, have at the same time thrown a clear
and vivid light on many portions of Holy Scripture.

     It embodies the Herculean task of weaving the testimony of the Egyptian records, whether
inscribed on the monuments or written on the countless rolls of papyrus, into a consecutive
history, derived solely from these ancient and authentic sources, and free from all the
colouring of external traditions.

   A Scientific Expedition may be said to have two histories. The one treats of the special

objects of the Expedition, the other of the personal adventures of those concerned in it. It is
only the former which finds permanent record in the transactions of Scientific Societies ; the
latter too often remains unwritten.

     This little work must be regarded as one side of the history of one step, and derives its
interest from its truthfulness as a record of an attempt to solve a great problem, viz., the
Distance 0/ the Earth from the Sun.

    Though this work is admitted to take rank with White's "Selborne" and Walton's
"Angler," no attempt has hitherto been made to illustrate the scenes, anecdotes, and fern
natures so graphically described by Mr. St. John. This want--to which attention has often

been called--it is the object of the present edition to supply. Great pains have been taken in
illustrating this edition, accurately to enter into the spirit, and, where possible, to depict the
actual scene of the events described in the text.

scholars and travellers, officials and merchants, succeeded each other, and passed away all too
rapidly, he remained a permanent living force, a mediator between the natives and the
governing class, an interpreter of the various Asiatic races, creeds, and longings, to their
alien but benevolent rulers. From Central India to Central Africa, and from Cabul to
Comorin, there are thousands who call John Wilson blessed." Authors Preface.

The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria.

A New Edition.                 By GEORGE DENNIS.

"Since the publication of the former edition of this work in 1848, many important

discoveries  have  been  made  in  Etruria                                         and  the  interest  in  such  discoveries  has  so  greatly

increased that museums have been established in not a few provincial towns, and private

collections have become numerous. I have had the gratification of learning that the former

edition of this work, apart from literary and antiquarian considerations, has received the

approval of not a few who have used it as a guide, on account of the conscientious accuracy

of its descriptions. I trust that the present issue will maintain its reputation in this respect,

for to ensure correctness has been my primary endeavour." Author's Preface.
