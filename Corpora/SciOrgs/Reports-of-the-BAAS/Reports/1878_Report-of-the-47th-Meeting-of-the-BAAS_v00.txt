   An Organizing Committee may also hold such preliminary Meetings as the

                          Constitution of the Sectional Committees*.

   On the first day of the Annual Meeting, the President, Vice-Presidents,
and Secretaries of each Section having been appointed by the General Com-

mittee, these Officers, and those previous Presidents and Vice-Presidents of

the Section who may desire to attend, are to meet, at 2 p.m., in their Com-

mittee Rooms, and enlarge the Sectional Committees by selecting individuals
from among the Members (not Associates) present at the Meeting whose as-
sistance they may particularly desire. The Sectional Committees thus con-
stituted shall have power to add to their number from day to day.

   The List thus formed is to be entered daily in the Sectional Minute-Book,
and a copy forwarded without delay to the Printer, who is charged with
publishing the same before 8 a.m. on the next day, in the Journal of the

Sectional Proceedings.

                             Business of the Sectional Committees.

   Committee Meetings are to be held on the Wednesday at 2 p.m., on the
following Thursday, Priday, Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, from 10 to
11 a.m., punctually, for the objects stated in the Rules of the Association,
and specified below.

 --The business is to be conducted in the following manner :

1. The President shall call on the Secretary to read the Minutes of tho

 -- previous Meetiug of the Committee.

2. No Paper shall bo read until it has been formally accepted by tho Com-

 -- mittee of the Section, and entered on the Minutes accordingly.

3. Papers which have been reported on unfavourably by the Organizing
            Committees shall not be brought before the Sectional Committees f.

    At the first meeting, one of the Secretaries will read the Minutes of last
year's proceedings, as recorded in the Minute-Book, and the Synopsis of
Recommendations adopted at the last Meeting of the Association and printed

in the last volume of the Transactions. He will next proceed to read the

Report of the Organizing Committee %. The List of Communications to be
read on Thursday shall be then arranged, and the general distribution of

Sections before the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore become necessary, in order

to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing justice to the several Communications,

that each Author should prepare an Abstract of his Memoir, of a length suitable for in-

sertion in the published Transactions of the Association, and that he should send it, toge-

ther with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or before      ,  addressed

thus-- " General Secretaries, British Association^ Albemarle Street, London, W. For

Section  .." If it should be inconvenient to the Author that his Paper should be read

on any particular days, he is requested to send information thereof to the Secretaries in a

separate note.

Secretaries are to correct, on a copy of the Journal, the list of papers which
have been read on that day, to add to it a list of those appointed to be read
on the next day, and to send this copy of the Journal as early in the day as
possible to the Printers, who are charged with printing the same before 8 a.m.
next morning in the Journal. It is necessary that one of the Secretaries of
each Section should call at the Printing Office and revise the proof each

evening.

   Minutes of the proceedings of every Committee are to be entered daily in
the Minute-P»ook, which should be confirmed at the next meeting of tho
Committee

   Lists of the Reports and Memoirs read in the Sections are to be entered
in the Minute-Book daily, which, with all Memoirs and Copies or Abstracts
of Memoirs furnished by Authors, are to be forwarded, at the close of the Sec-
tional Meetings, to the Assistant General Secretaiy.

   The Vice-Presidents and Secretaries of Sections become ex officio temporary
Members of the General Committee (vide p. xix), and will receive, on ap-
plication to the Treasurer in the Reception Room, Tickets entitling them to

attend its Meetings.

   The Committees will take into consideration any suggestions which may

be offered by their Members for the advancement of Science. They are
specially requested to roview the recommendations adopted at preceding
Meetings, as published in the volumes of the Association and the communi-
cations made to the Sections at this Meeting, for the purposes of selecting
definite points of research to which individual or combined exertion may be
usefully directed, and branches of knowledge on the state and progress of
which Reports arc wanted : to name individuals or Committees for the exe-
cution of such Reports or researches ; and to state whether, and to what de-
gree, these objects may be usefully advanced by the appropriation of tho
funds of the Association, by application to Government, Philosophical Insti-

tutions, or Local Authorities.
    In case of appointment of Committees for special objects of Science, it is

expedient that all Members of the Committee should be named, and one of

them appointed to act as Secretary, for insuring attention to business.

   Committees have power to add to their number persons whose assistance
they may require.

   The recommendations adopted by the Committees of Sections are to be
registered in the Forms furnished to their Secretaries, and one Copy of each

is to be forwarded, without delay, to the Assistant General Secretary for pre-
sentation to the Committee of Recommendations. Unless this be done, the

--Recommendations cannot receive the sanction of the Association.
   N.B. Recommendations which may originate in any one of the Sections

must first be sanctioned by the Committee of that Section before they can bo
referred to the Committee of Recommendations or confirmed by the General
Committee.

unless they be renowed in the original or a modified form by the General

Committee.

   No Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of the

British Association without special permission from the General Committee
to do so ; and no money so raised shall be expended except in accordance

with the rules of the Association.

   In each Committee, the Member first named is the only person entitled to
call on the Treasurer, Professor A. W. Williamson, University College, London,

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                           xllX

Report of the Council for the Fear 1876-77, presented to the General
       Committee at Plymouth on Wednesday, August 15th, 1877.

   The Council have received Eeports during the past year from the General
Treasurer, and his Account for the year will be laid before the General Com-

mittee this day.

   The following Eesolution was referred by the General Committee at
Glasgow to the Council for consideration, and for action, if it should seem

desirable :

" That the Council be requested to consider and take steps, if they think

   it desirable, to urge upon Her Majesty's Government the advisability
   of forming a Museum of Scientific Instruments and Chemical Products,
   as suggested in the Memorial presented in June last to the Lord
   President of Her Majesty's Council."

   The Council having considered this Eesolution, came to the conclusion that

while they believe that a Permanent Museum of Scientific Instruments might

be of great value, it is their opinion that the objects of the Memorial referred
to in the Eesolution submitted to the Council are, as a whole, neither so
clearly defined, nor so free from valid objections, as to justify the Council of
the British Association in supporting the proposals of the Memorial in its

present form.

   The attention of the Council having been drawn to the character of some
of the Sectional Proceedings at late Meetings of the Association, a Committee
was appointed to consider and report to the Council on the possibility of
excluding unscientific or otherwise unsuitable papers and discussions from

the Sectional Proceedings of the Association.

   The Committee recommended that papers which have been reported on
unfavourably by the Organizing Committees shall not be brought before the
Sectional Committees, and that, in the rules for conducting the business of

the Sectional Committees, the following rules should be inserted, viz. :

1. The President shall call on the Secretary to read the minutes of the
   previous Meeting of the Committee.

2. No paper shall be read until it has been formally accepted by the

   Committee of the Section, and entered on the minutes accordingly.

The Council propose that this alteration of rules shall be carried into effect.

The Committee in their Eeport further considered that some of the

subjects brought before Section F could not be considered scientific in the

ordinary sense of that word, and that the question of the discontinuance of

Section F deserved the serious consideration of the Council.

The Council have requested the Committee to report more fully the reasons

which had induced them to come to this conclusion, but the Committee have

not yet mado a further report.                                d

    1877.
--1 UEroRT 1877.

   The Council regret to state that Mr. Griffith has informed them that he is
desirous of -withdrawing from the office of Assistant General Secretary, -which
he has held for nearly sixteen years.

   The Council having carefully considered the steps expedient to be taken in
consequence of Mr. Griffith's proposed withdrawal, have resolved to select
Mr. J. E. H. Gordon, B.A., of Caius College, Cambridge, for nomination as
Assistant Secretary after the Dublin Meeting in 1878. The Council propose
that Mr. Gordon be requested to attend the present Meeting, and to assist

generally during the ensuing year.

    To cover his expenses during this preliminary period, the Council re-
commend that a grant of £100 be made to him.

   The following Foreign Men of Science, who had attended the Glasgow

Meeting, have been elected Corresponding Members :

Professor Cremona.                    Dr. Lasaulx.
Professor Eccker.                     Professor P. D. Silva.

Professor Von Quintus Icilius.        Dr. "W. J. Janssen.

Dr. G. Jung.

   The Council have been informed that invitations for the Meeting in 1870,
or following years, will be presented from Swansea and Nottingham, and
from York for the year 1881, being the fiftieth anniversary of the British
Association, the first meeting of which was held in that city.

   The following are the names of Members of Council for the past year who,

in accordance with the regulations, are not eligible for re-election this year,

viz. :

                         PRESIDENT.

After the long interval of sis and thirty years the British Association for
the Advancement of Science holds its annual meeting, the forty-seventh

since its foundation, in this beautiful and interesting locality ; and, it so

happens that, on this occasion as on the former, it passes from Glasgow to

WePlymouth.  are delighted to be assembled here, and are even surprised

that the Association has been able so long to resist the power of attraction

by which it has been gravitating towards this place. "While we are prepared

to be charmed with the surpassing beauty of its scenery, and know the

deep interest of its prehistoric vestiges, its historic memories, and its artistic

associations, we have been -frequently reminded of its scientific vigilance

by the records of its active work ; and we are now ready and anxious to
witness all we can behold of its energy and success in the application of

scientific discovery to the practical arts. Should we, as might be expected

in a place hitherto so famous in its relation's to our naval and military

history, find most prominent that* relating to the mechanism of war, we

shall still hope that the attainment of greater perfection in the engines of

destruction may only be the means of rendering peace more permanent and

secure.

It is a source of regret to myself, and may be, I fear, a cause of detriment

to this Meeting, that the choice of a President should have fallen upon
one whose constant occupation with special branches of science has fitted
him very inadequately for the distinguished position to which he has been

called. I can only derive comfort from knowing that, wherever it may
bo necessary, there are many others present most able to supply what may

be wanting on my part ; and I must therefore at once bespeak their assistance

and your indulgence.

I have selected for the subject of the remarks which I am about to offer

a biological topic, namely, the " Development of the Forms of Animal

Life," with which my studies have been occupied, and which has important

bearings on some of the more interesting biological questions now agitating

mythe scientific world. But before proceeding with the discussion of

myspecial subject, it is  desire to call your attention shortly to the remark-

able change in the manner of viewing biological questions which has taken

--place in this country during the last half-century a change so great,

indeed, that it can scarcely be fully appreciated except by those who, like

myself, have lived through the period of its occurrence.

In the three earlier decades of this century it was the common belief, in

this country at least, shared by men of science as well as by the larger body

of persons who had given no special attention to the subject, that the various

forms of plants and animals recognized by naturalists in their systematic

arrangements of genera and species were permanently fixed and unalterable,

that they were not subject to greater changes than might occur as occasional

variations, and that such was the tendency to the maintenance of uniformity
in their specific characters that, when varieties did arise, there was a

natural disposition to return, in the course of succeeding generations, to
the fixed form and nature supposed to belong to the parental stock ; and it

was also a necessary part of this view of the permanency of species that each
was considered to have been originally produced from an individual having
the exact form which its descendants ever afterwards retained. To this
scientific dogma was further added the quasi-religious view that in the exercise

of infinite wisdom and goodness, the Creator, when He called the successive

species of plants and animals into existence, conferred upon each precisely the
organization and the properties adapting it best for the kind of life for
which it was designed in the general scheme of creation. This was the older
doctrine of "Direct Creation," of "Final Causes," and of " Teleological

Eelation of Structure and Function ; " and those only who have known the
firm hold which such views formerly had over the public mind can under-

stand the almost unqualified approbation with which the reasoning on these
questions in writings like the ' Bridgewater Treatises ' (not to mention older
books on Natural Theology) were received in their time, as well as the very
opposite feelings excited by every work which seemed to present a different

view of the plan of creation.

   On the Continent of Europe, it is true, some bold speculators, such as

Goethe, Ofcen, Lamarck, and Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, had, in the end of the last
and commencement of this century, broached the doctrine that there is in living
beings a continuous series of gradations as well as a consistent and general
plan of organization, and that the creation, therefore, or origin of the

IxX REPORT 1877.

different forms of plants and animals must have been the result of a gradual
process of development or of derivation one from another, the whole standing
connected together in certain causal relations. But in Britain such views,
though known and not altogether repulsive to a few, obtained little favour, and,
by some strange process of reasoning, were looked upon by the great majority
as little short of impious questionings of the supreme power of the Almighty.

  How --different is the position of matters in this respect in our day ! when

the cautious naturalist receives and adopts with the greatest reserve the
statement of fixed and permanent specific characters as belonging to the
different forms of organized beings, and is fully persuaded of the constant
tendency to variation which all species show even in the present condition
of the earth, and of the still greater liability to change which must have

--existed in the earlier periods of its formation when the belief prevails that,

so far from being the direct product of distinct acts of creation, the various
forms of plants and animals have been gradually evolved in a slow gradation

--of increasing complexity and when it is recognized by a largo majority of

naturalists that the explanation of this wonderful relation of connexion
between previously existing and later forms is to be found in the constant
tendency to variation during development and growth, and the perpetuation
of such variations by hereditary transmission through successive generations
in the long but incalculable lapse of the earth's natural mutations. These,
together with the adaptation^ structure and function to external conditions
 securing the survival of the fittest, are, as you must all be aware, in their

essential features the views now known as Darwinism, first simultaneously
brought forward by Wallace and Darwin in 1858, and which, after being
 more fully elaborated in the works of the latter and ably supported by the

 former, secured, in the incredibly short space of ten or twelve years, the
 general approval of a large portion of the scientific world. Opinion has, in

 fact, now undergone such a change that there are few works on Natural

 History, whether of a special or more general character, in which the rela-
 tion the scientific facts bear to the newer doctrines is not carefully indicated
 that, with the general public also, the words " Evolution " and " Develop-
 ment" have ceased to excite the feelings, amounting almost to horror, which

they at first produced in the minds of those to whom they were equally

 unfamiliar and suspicious ; and that, even in popular literature, illustra-
 tions are not unfrequently drawn in such terms of Darwinian theory as
 " struggle for existence," "natural selection," " survival of the fittest," and

 the like.

     It cannot be doubted that in this country, and partly on the Continent, the

 influence of authority had much to do with the persistence of the older

 teleological views ; and, as has been well remarked by Haeckel, one of the
 ablest and keenest supporters of the modern doctrine, the combined influ-

ence more especially of the opinions held by three of the greatest natu-

ralists and biologists who have ever lived, Linnoeus, Haller, and Cuvior
(men unsurpassed in the learning of their time, and the authors of im-

portant discoveries in a wide range of biological science), was decidedly
adverse to the free current of speculative thought upon the more general

doctrines of biology. And if it were warrantable to attribute so great a
change of opinion as that to which I have adverted as occurring in my own

time to the influence of any single intellect, it must be admitted that it is
justly due to the vast range and accuracy of his knowledge of scientific facts,
the quick appreciation of their mutual interdependence, and, above all, the
unexampled clearness and candour in statement of Charles Darwin.

   Eut while we readily acknowledge the large share which Darwin has had
in guiding scientific thought into the newer tracks of biological doctrine, we

shall also be disposod to allow that the slow aud difficult process of emanci-
jiation from the thraldom of dogmatic opinion in regard to a system of
creation, and the adoption of large and independent views more consistent
with observation, reason, philosophy, and religion, has only been possible
under the effect of the general progress of scientific knowledge and the
acquisition of sounder methods of applying its principles to the explanation
of natural phenomena.

    I have already referred to Goethe, Oken, Lamarck, and Geoffroy St.-Hilairc

as among the most prominent of the earlier pioneers in the modem or reformed

conceptions of biological laws. But were it desirable to mark the progress
of opinion by quoting other authors and labourers whose contributions have
mainly supplied the materials out of which the new fabric has been con-

structed, I should have to produce a long catalogue of distinguished names,

among which would be found those of Lyell and Owen, as earliest shaping
the doctrines and guiding opinion in this country, Johannes Miiller and
Yon Baer, as taking the places of Haller and Cuvier on the Continent, and

a host of other faithful workers in Biology belonging to the earlier part

of this century, such as G. Treviranus, J. F. Meckel, Carus, and many
more*. To Huxley more especially and Herbert Spencer the greatest influ-

ence on British thought in the same direction is to be ascribed.

    Let us hope that in these times, when it has been found necessary to modify
the older teleological views to so great an extent, although there may still
be much that is unknown, and wide differences of opinion in regard to the
nature and sequence of natural phenomena and the mode of their interprota-

   * It would also be unjust to omit to mention here one of the earliest attempts to bring
British opinion into a new channel, by the remarkable work entitled ' Vestiges of Creation,'
wbich appeared in 1844, nor to conceal from ourselves the unmerited ridicule and obloquy

attempted to be thrown upon the author, not perhaps so much on account of tbo many

inaccuracies unavoidable in the- endeavour at that time to overtake so large a field, as
directed against the dangerous tendencies supposed to lurk in its reasoning.
lxxii  --REPORT 1877.

tion, all naturalists will now concur in one important principle, viz. that

as truthful observation and candid judgment must alone be our guides in the
interpretation of Nature, that theory of Creation is best deserving of our
adoption which is most consistent with the whole body of facts carefully
observed and compared.

   To attempt to trace, within the limits to which my remarks must be con-

fined, the influence which the progress of knowledge has exercised upon the
scientific and general conception of biological doctrines would be impossible,
for the modification of opinion on these subjects has proceeded not less
from the rapid advance which our age has witnessed in the progress of
general science, especially of physics and chemistry, than from that in the
department of biology itself.

    Thus, to go no further than the most general laws of nature, the whole
doctrine of the conservation and transmutation of force in Physics, so ably
expounded to this Association by Mr. Justice Grove, the theory of com-
pound radicals and substitution, with the discovery of organic synthesis, in
Chemistry, and the more recent advance in speculation with regard to the

molecular constitution and properties of matter, with which we must asso-

ciate the names of our last President and of Clerk Maxwell, in completely
changing the aspect of physical and chemical sciences within the last thirty-

five years, have paved the way for views of the constitution and action of

organized bodies very different from those which could be formed at the time

of the first Meeting of the Association in this place. And if, confining our-
selves to the department of Biology, we note the discovery by microscopical

observation of the minuter elementary forms of organization, more especially
as flowing from the comprehensive views of organized structure promulgated
by Schleiden and Schwann nearly forty years ago, the later discovery and
investigation of living protoplasmic substances, the accumulated evidence of
progressive and continuous types of animal and vegetable forms in the suc-
cession of superimposed strata composing the crust of the earth, the recent

discoveries as to the conditions of life at great depths in the ocean, the vast

body of knowledge brought together by the labours of anatomists and phy-
siologists as to the structure and functions of almost every plant and animal,
and (still more, perhaps, than any other single branch of biological inquiry)

if we note the rapid and immense progress which has been made during the
last fifty years in the study of the entirely modern science of the develop-
ment of individual living beings, we shall be able to form some conception

of the enormous extension in our time of the basis of observation and fact

from which biological phenomena may now be surveyed, and from which just
views may be deduced as to their mutual relations and general nature.

It is now familiarly known that almost all (if not, indeed, all) the plants
address.  lxxiii

  and animals existing on the earth's surface derive their origin from parents
  or previously existing heings vrhose form and nature they closely reproduce

 in their life's history. By far the greater number spring from germs in tho
 form of visible and known spores, seeds, or eggs ; a few may be traced to

 other germs, or to vestiges of the parental body, the exact nature of which

 may be doubtful ; and some, including even a certain number of those also
 produced from known germs, are either constantly or occasionally multiplied

 by budding, or by a process of cleavage or direct and visible division of tho
 parent body.

    The germ constituting the basis of new formation, whether it be of un-
 known nature or in the form of spore, seed, or ovum, is of the simplest kind of
 organization, and the process by which a new plant or animal is produced is

 necessarily one of gradual change and of advance from a simpler to a more
 complex form and structure : it is one of " evolution " or, more appropriately
named, of " development." But before proceeding to discuss the subject of de-
velopment in beings of which the germs are known, it is right to advert to the
preliminary and often debated question, which naturally presents itself, viz.:

Do all living or organized beings, without exception, spring from germs, or
from any kind of organized matter that has belonged to parents? or may
there not be some, especially among the simpler forms (with regard, indeed,

to which alone there has of late been any question), which are produced by the

direct combination of their component elements, in the way of the so-called

spontaneous or equivocal generation, heterogenesis or abiogenesis ?

    The importance of the right solution of this problem is not confined
merely to the discovery of the mode of origin of the lowly organisms which
have been the more immediate object of investigation by naturalists in recent
times, but is one of much wider significance, seeing that, if it shall be satis-

factorily proved or even rendered probable that in the course of cosmical
development all the various kinds of plants and animals have been gradually
produced by evolution out of preexisting simpler forms, and thus the whole

series of organized beiugs in nature is shown to be one of hereditary con-
nexion and derivation, then it would follow that the history of the origin of
the simplest organisms may be the key to that of the first commencement of
life upon the earth's surface, and an indication of the relation in which
the whole succeeding progenies stand to their parental stocks.

   From the very lucid and masterly view of this subject given by Prof. Hux-

ley in his Address to the Association at Liverpool, so recently as in IS 70,

in which the conclusion he formed was mainly based on the exhaustive
and admirable researches of Pasteur, I might have dispensed with making
further reference to it now, but for the very confident statements since made

by the supporters of the doctrine of Abiogenesis, among whom Dr. Bastian

stands most prominent in this country, and for the circumstance that the

life-history of many of the lower organisms was still imperfectly known.
lxxiv  --report 1877.

   During tho last seven or eight years, however, renewed investigations hy
most competent inquirers have followed one another in quick succession, from

a review of which we cannot but arrive at a conclusion adverse to the theory

of Hetorogenesis, namely, that no development of organisms, even of the
most simple kind, in fermenting or putrefying solutions, has been satisfac-

torily observed to occur when the conditions of the experiments were such

as entirely to exclude tho possibility of their being descended from germs,
or equivalent formative particles, belonging to preexisting bodies of a similar

kind. I can do no more here than name the authors of the most conclusive

experiments on this subject, nearly in the order of their publication, as those

of Mr. "W. N. Hartley in 1872, Messrs. Pode and Ray Lankester in 1873, Dr.
Burdon Sanderson in that and tho following years, Dr. W. Roberts in 1874,

Professor Lister in 1875, and most recontly of Professor Tyndall, Professor
Cohn, and of Messrs. Dallingor and Drysdale *.

   But, admitting that the evidence from direct experiment is such as entirely

to shut us out from entertaining the view that spontaneous generation

occurs in the present condition of the earth, we are not relieved from the
difficulty of explaining how living organisms or their germs first made
their appearance, nor are we debarred from attempting to form hypo-
theses as to how this may have taken place. First, upon the theory of
Evolution, which, strictly carried out, supposes the more complex organisms

to be derived from the more simple, it might be held that the conditions

affecting the combination of the primary elements of matter into organic

forms may at one time have been different from those which now prevail, and
that, under those different conditions, abiogenesis may have been possible,
and may have operated to lay the foundations of organic life in the simpler

--forms in which it at first appeared a state of things, however, which can

only be vaguely surmised, and in regard to which no exact information can
be obtained. Or, secondly, evading the difficulty of strict cosmical evolution,

we might suppose that vital conditions may have been coeval with the first

existence of physical and chemical properties in the rest of natural bodies.
But this hypothesis would be exposed to the objection that, according to the
cosmical view generally held by physicists, the whole materials composing
the earth have originally been subjected to incandescent heat. Nor is the
difficulty abolished, but only removed to a more remote period, by the suppo-
sition of the transport of germs from another planet or their introduction
by means of meteorites or meteoric dust ; for, besides the objection arising
from the circumstance that these bodies must have been subjected to a very

high temperature, we should still have every thing to learn as to the manner

in which the germs originated in the far distant regions of space from which

they have been conveyed.
   The incompleteness of the geological record leaves us in the dark as to the

time at which the first dawnings of life appeared in the lower strata of the
earth's surface. The most recent researches tend to carry the origin of life

back to a much earlier period than was at one time believed, and (if the

famous Eozoon be admitted as evidence) even into that of the Laurentian
strata. But if doubts should still prevail with regard to the presence of
definite organized forms in the older sedimentary strata, the occurrence in
them of carbon in the form of graphite in large quantities makes the previous

existence of living organisms at least possible, and it may bo that the com-

plete metamorphosis which these rocks have undergone has entirely removed

all definite traces of organization.

   Nor have we the means from geological data of determining whether the
beings of the vegetable or of the animal kingdom first made their appearance.
If we adopt the view which has for some time been entertained by physio-

logists that animals are entirely dependent, directly or indirectly, on plants
for the material which constitutes their living substance, and that plants, as
constructive agents, alone have the power to bring together the elements of
lifeless matter, from such states as carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, into
the condition of the living solid, the inference would be inevitable, at least
for the great majority of the animal creation, that they must have been
preceded by plants. But palaeontology is as yet silent on this interesting

question ; and, if we consider the remarkable approach which is made in
structure and properties between the lowest and simplest members of the two
kingdoms of organic nature, so that at last all distinction between them

seems entirely to vanish, and a set of organisms is found partaking equally
of animal and vegetable characters, or, rather, exhibiting properties which

are common to them both, wo shall hesitate to postulate confidently for the

primitive antecedence of vegetable life, although, perhaps, in later epochs the

preexistence of vegetables may be looked upon as necessary to the life of

more developed animal organisms.
lxxvi                              --REPORT 1877.

   But while we thus speculate on the first appearance of organized bodies in
nature, we ought to keep in mind that we are equally ignorant of the mode
of origin of the inorganic elements and their compounds ; and we may
therefore be excused if we suspend all theory and conjecture until we shall

be guided to more reliable hypotheses through the plain track of observation

and experiment.

   The practical applications of the increased knowledge of the origin of
minute animal and vegetable organisms are so numerous that it would

occupy a much longer time than is at my disposal to give any detailed account

of them ; but they are of such immense importance in their commercial,
social, and sanitary relations that they ought never to be lost sight of.

   It is now proved beyond doubt that the origin of putrefaction and fermen-

tation is dependent on the presence in the substances which are the seat of

change in these processes, or in the surrounding air, of the gerrns of minute
organisms of an animal or vegetable nature, and that the maintenance of the

chemical changes in which these processes mainly consist is coincident with
and casually (if not essentially) dependent upon the growth and multiplica-

tion of these organisms.

   Professor Lister had the merit of being the first to apply the germ theory

of putrefaction  to  explain  the  formation  of  putrid  matters  in the living body
                                                                                                                                                ;

and he has founded on this theory the now well-known antiseptic treatment

of wounds, the importance of which it would be difficult to overestimate.

The success or failure of plans for the preservation of meat and other

articles of food without question depends on the possibility of the complete

exclusion of the germs which are the cause of putrefaction and fermenta-

tion ; and the management of such plans must therefore be founded on the
most accurate knowledge of these organisms, and the circumstances influenc-

ing the persistence of their vitality and the vigour of their growth.

The theory of Biogenesis has also lately been the guide in the investigation

of the causes of various forms of disease, both in the lower animals and in

man, with the result of showing that in many of them the infective substance

consists, in all probability, of germs of minute animal or vegetable organisms.

There is very great probability, indeed, that all the Zymotic diseases (by

which we understand the various forms of fevers) have their origin in germs.

As has been well remarked by Baxter in an able paper on " The Action of

Disinfectants," the analogies of action of contagiaare similar to those of septic

organisms, not to processes simply of oxidation or deoxidation. These orga-

nisms, studied in suitable fluids, multiply indefinitely when introduced in all

but infinitesimal proportions. Thus they are, as near as we can perceive, the

very essence of contagia*.

   * For the most interesting information on this subject, I cannot do better than refer to
the very able Papers by Dr. Burdon Sanderson in the ' Eeports of the Medical Officer
of the Privy Council,' 1873, 1874, and 1875.
ADDKESS.  lxwii

   Leaving, however, these and many other general questions regarding the
origin of the lowest forms of animal and vegetable life, let us now turn
our attention to the mode of development of a new heing in those possessing
more obvious and known germs. The general nature of the formative pro-

cess, in all instances where fertilized germs are produced, will be best un-
derstood by a short sketch of the phenomena ascertained to occur in different

kinds of plants.

   In the higher or Phanerogamic plants it is generally well known that tho

combination of two parts of the flower is necessary to the production of a seed
containing the embryo or young plant. Beginning with the discovery of the
pollen-tubes by Amici in 1823, the careful and minute investigations of a long
liue of illustrious vegetable physiologists have broiight to light the details of

the process by which fertilization is effected, and have shown, in fact, how the
minute tube developed from the inner membrane of the pollen-granule, as

soon as it falls upon the stigmatic tissue of the seed-bearing plant, insinuates
itself by a rapid process of development between the cells of the style, and
reaches at last the ovide, in the interior of which is the embryo-sac ; how,

having passed into the micropyle or orifice of the ovule, it makes its way
to the embryo-sac ; how a minute portion of the fertilizing substance of

the fovilla transudes from the pollen-tube into the cavity of the embryo-sac,
in which by this time a certain portion of the protoplasm has become differ-

--entiated into the germinal vesicle thereby stimulating it to further growth

and development, the earliest phenomena of which manifest themselves by
the formation of an investing cell-wall, and by the occurrence of cell-division
which results in the formation of the embryo or plantule of the seed.

    Thus it appears that the essential part of the process of production in Pha-
nerogamic plants is the formation in the parent plant of cells of two different
kinds, which by themselves have little or no independent power of further
growth, but which, by their union, give rise to a product in which the power
of development is raised to the highest degree.

   By further researches it is now known that the same law prevails in all tho
remaining members of the vegetable kingdom, with the exception only of tho

very simplest forms *.
    In viewing the reproductive process in the series of Cryptogamic plants,

two facts at once strike us as remarkable in the modifications which are

--observed to accompany the formation of a productive germ, viz. : first, that

the difference between the two productive elements becomes more prominent,
or as it were more higbly specialized, in the Cryptogamic than in the Pha-
nerogamic plants ; and second, that in the simpler and lower forms this differ-
ence gradually disappears till it is lost in complete uniformity of the pro-

 ductive elements.

     * It will be observed that I leave entirely out of view the whole subject of the multipli-
 cation of plants by budding or simple division.
lxxviii                       --repokt 1877.

Thus in the whole tribe of the Ferns and Vascular Cryptogams, in the

higher Algas and Fungi, in the Characeae and in the Mosses, the differentia-

tion of the productive elements is carried to a very high degree ; for whilo

that belonging to the embryo or germ presents the structure of a simple cell

which remains at rest, or in a comparatively passive state, and, absorbing

into itself the substance of the other, becomes the seat of subsequent

development, the other, corresponding to the pollen of the staminiferous

phanerogam, is usually separated from the place of its formation, and, having

undergone a peculiar modification of structure by which it acquires active

moving cilia, it changes place and is directed towards the germinal structure,

and, coming in contact with its elementary cell, is more or less absorbed or

lost in the fertilizing process. The protoplasm of the germinal cell thus

acted on and fertilized then proceeds to undergo the changes of development

by which the foundation is laid for the new plant.

In the Algte and Fungi, however, there are gradations of the differentiation

of the two reproductive elements which are of the greatest interest in lead-

ing to a comprehension of the general nature of the formative process. For

in the lower and simpler forms of these plants, such as the Desmidiea?, Heso-

carpese, and other Conjugatoe, we find that there is no distinction in structure

or form to be perceived between the two cells which unite in what is termed

conjugation ; and a complete fusion or intermixture of the two masses of

protoplasm residts in the production of a single, usually spherical, mass holding

the place of an embryo. And that there is an absence of specialization be-

tween the two uniting cells is clearly shown, in both Desmidium and Meso-

carpus, by the fact that the embryo or zygospore is formed in the mass

resulting from the union of the protruded portions of the two cells ; while
in more ordinary cases, as in Spirogyra, where the embryo is formed in

one of the two cells, it seems to be indifferent in which of them it is

formed.

From this, which may be regarded as the most elementary type of new

production by the union of two cells, the transition is not a great one to

Wethe development of a progeny without any such union.  might conjecture,

then, that the capacity for separate or individual existence extends in the

lowest organisms to the whole or to each structural element of their organi-

zation, while as we rise in the scale of vegetable life (and the same view

might apply to the animal kingdom) this capacity is more and more divided

between the two productive elements, or, at least, is only called into full

action by their combination.

The germinal element of plants thus consists of a simple primordial cell,

varying in different kinds, but in all of them probably containing the essential

substance protoplasm ; and the most immediate result or effect of fertilization
is the multiplication by repeated fissiparous division of the previously existing

cells. The new individual resulting from this cellular growth usually remains
ADDRESS.                                          lxxix

within the parent body, without, however, direct union or continuity of tissue,

till the embryo has attained some advancement, as in the well-known case of

tho seeds of a phanerogam ; but there are many varieties in the mode of its

disposition among the lower plants.

  A remarkablo exception to the more direct relation of the process of ferti-

lization to the formation of the new individual or embryo occurs in some

plants, simulating in some respects that kind of variation in animal reproduc-

Ation which has been named alternate generation.  well-known instance of

this is observed in the Vascular Cryptogams. The prothallium of the Ferns,

for example, results from the development of so-called spores or unicellular

biids, which are familiar as being formed in small capsules on the lower leaf-

surface ; and in this prothallium, when it has reached a certain stage of vege-

tation, there are formed the archegonia, containing the oospheres or germ-

cells, which are fertilized by the moving ciliated particles developed in the
cells of the antheridia, the process resulting in the production of a new

spore-bearing frond or fern-plant.

Recent researches have also called attention to the remarkable arrange-

ments in many Phanerogamic plants for the prevention of fertilization of the

pistils by pollen from the same flower, or even from the same plant. In the

latter case this is effected by the separation of stamens and pistils in different
flowers. In the former case, where both organs occur in the same flower,
the adaptations, whether of a mechanical or of a physiological character, by

which self-fertilization is prevented, as ascertained by numerous recent inves-

tigations (among which those of Darwin are most conspicuous), are of the

most varied and often the most complicated kind.

   Let us now turn to the consideration of the Development of Animals
and let me say in the outset that it will be necessary for me to confine my

remarks chiefly to the higher or vertebrated animals, and to certain parts

--only of the history of their development more particularly the structure and

formation of the ovum or egg, some of its earlier developmental changes, and
the relation of these to the formation of the new animal.

   I cannot enter upon the consideration of this topic without adverting to
the very recent acquisition of some of the most important facts upon which
this branch of knowledge is founded ; and I feel it to be peculiarly appropriate,
in the year of his death, to refer to a Biologist whose labours contributed
more powerfully than those of any other person to give to animal embryology

the character of a systematic branch of science, and to whom we owe some

--most important original discoveries I mean Karl Ernest von Baer of

Konigsberg, St. Petersburg, and Dorpat.

   Of observers who, previous to Yon Baer, were mainly instrumental in
preparing the way for the creation of a more exact modern science of embry-

ology only two can be mentioned, viz. Caspar Frederick Wolff of St. Peters-
lxxx  --REPORT 1877.

 burg, well known as the author of a work entitled ' Theoria Generationis,'

 published in 1759, by which the epigenesis or actual formation of organs

 in a new being was first demonstrated, and Christian Pander, 'who, by his
 researches made at Yviirzburg, explained, in a work published in 1817, the

 principal changes by which the embryo arises and is formed.

    Von Baer was born in the Eussian province of Esthonia on the 29 th of

 February, 1792. After having been fifteen years Professor in the Prussian
 University of Konigsberg, he was called to St. Petersburg, and having some
 years later been appointed to a newly established professorship of Compara-

tive Anatomy and Physiology, he remained in that city for nearly thirty years
as the most zealous and able promoter of scientific education and research,
stimulating and guiding all around him by his unexampled activity, compre-
hensive and original views, sound judgment, and cordial cooperation. In
1868, at the age of 76, he retired to Dorpat, from the University of which
he had received his degree in 1814, and continued still to occupy himself with
Avorking and writing in his favourite subjects, as well as interesting himself

in every thing connected with educational and scientific progress, to very
near the time of his death, which occurred on the 28th of November, 1876,
in his 85th year.

   Although Yon Baer's researches, according to the light in which we may
now view them, contributed in no small degree to the introduction of the

newer views of the morphological relations of organic structure which have
culminated in the Theory of Descent, yet he was unwilling to adopt the views
of Darwin ; and one of his latest writings, completed in the last year of his
life, was in vigorous opposition to that doctrine.

    It would have been most interesting and instructive to trace the history of

the progress of discovery in Embryology from the period of Von Baer down

to the present time ; but such a history would not be suitable to the purpose
of this address ; and I can only venture here, in addition to Rathke, the
colleague of Baer in Konigsberg, to select two names out of the long list of

--distinguished workers in this field during the last forty years, viz. : Theodor F.

W. von Bischoff, of Giessen and Munich, to whom we owe the greatest progress

in the knowledge of the development of Mammals, by his several memoirs,
appearing from 1842 to 1854; and Robert Bemak, of Berlin, whose researches
on the development of Birds and Batrachia, appearing from 1850 to 1855,
gave greatly increased exactness and extension to the general study of deve-

lopment.

   The germinal element from which, when fertilized, the new animal is

--derived is contained within the animal ovum or egg a compact and definite

mass of organic matter, in which, notwithstanding great apparent variations,

there is maintained throughout all the members of the animal kingdom,

excepting the Protozoa, which are destitute of true ova, a greater uniformity

in some respects than belongs to the germinal product of plants.
                           ADDRESS.                                                                                                                                                                                           lxxxi

   Usually more or less spherical in form, the animal ovum presents the
essential characters of a " complete cell," in the signification given by Schwann
to that term. The germinal substance is enclosed by an external vesicular
membrane or cell-wall. Within this coveriug the cell-substance (generally

named yolk or vitellus, from the analogy of the fowl's egg) consists, to a greater
or less extent, of a mass of protoplasm ; and imbedded in this mass, in a deter-

minate situation, there is found a smaller internal vesicular body, the germi-
nal vesicle or nucleus, and within that the somewhat variable macula or

nucleolus.

   Now the first thing which strikes us as remarkable connected with the

ovum is the very great variation in its size as compared with the entire animal
to which it belongs, while in all of them the same simple or elementary struc-
ture is maintained. The ovum of mammals, for example (discovered by Von

Baer in 1827) is a comparatively small body, of the average diameter of

about y^g- of an inch, and consequently scarcely weighing more than a

minute fraction of a grain, perhaps not more than the                                                                                                                                                             1  ^ part.  And
                                                                                                                                                                                                               1

further, in two animals differing so widely in size as the elephant and the

mouse, the weights of which may stand towards each other in the proportion

of 150,000 to 1, there is scarcely any difference in the size of the mature

ovum.

   On the other hand, if we compare this small ovum of the mammal with
the yolk of the egg in the common fowl, the part to which it most nearly
corresponds, it may be estimated that the latter body would contain above
three millions of the smaller ova of a mammal.

The attribute of size, however, in natural objects ceases to excite feelings

of wonder or surprise as our knowledge of them increases, whether that be

Weby familiar observation or by more scientific research.                                                                                                                                                         need not, at all

events, on account of the apparent minuteness of the ovum of the mammifer

or of any other animal, have any doubts as to the presence of a sufficient amount

of germinal substance for explaining in the most materialistic fashion the

transmission of the organic and other properties and resemblances between the

parent and offspring. For we are led to believe, by those who have recently

given their attention to the size of molecules composing both living and dead

matter, that in such a body as this minute ovum of the mammal there may
be as many as five thousand billions of molecules ; and even if we restrict

ourselves to the smaller germinal vesicle, and, indeed, to the smallest germinal

particle which might be made visible by the highest microscopic enlargement,

there are still sufficient molecules for all the requirements of the most exact-

ing material biologist *.

    * According to a calculation made bj Mr. Sorby, the number of molecules in the ger-
minal vesicle of the mammalian ovum is such that if one molecule were to be lost in every
second of time, the whole would not be exhausted in seventeen years. See Address to the
Microscopic Society, in Journ. of Microscop. Science, vol. xv. p. 225, and ' Nature,' vol.
xiii. p. 332. See also Darwin on "Pangenesis," in his work on 'Variations,' &c. (18C8),
Ixxxii  --report 1877.

   This great disparity of size, however, is connected with an important
difference in the disposition of the yolk-substance, according to -which

--ova may he distinguished as of two kinds the large- and the small-yolkcd

ova, between which there are also many intermediate gradations. The

larger-yolked ova belong to the whole tribe of birds, scaly reptiles, osseous
and cartilaginous fishes, and the Cephalopods among, the Invertebrates ; and
are distinguished by the strictly germinal part or protoplasm being collected

into a small disk, known familiarly as the cicatricida of the fowl's egg, and

to be seen as a whitish spot on that side of the yolk which naturally floats
uppermost, while the rest of the yolk, of a deeper yellow colour, contains
a large quantity of vitelline granules or globules of a different chemical
nature from the protoplasm.

   The phenomena of embryonic development are, in the first instance at
least, confined to the germinal disk, and the rest of the yolk serves in a
secondary or more remote manner to furnish materials for nourishment of
the embryo and its accessory parts. Thus we distinguish the germinal from
the nutritive or food-yolk, or, as the younger Yan Beneden has named them,
the protoplasm and the deutoplasm.

    In the smaller ovum of the mammal, on the other hand, it seems as if the

whole, or nearly the whole, of the yolk were protoplasmic or germinal.

There may be some admixture of yolk-granules ; but there is not the
marked separation or limitation of the protoplasmic substance which is so

 distinct in birds, and the earliest changes of development extend to the
 whole component substance of the yolk, or, in other words, the yolk is entirely
 germinal. Hence some have given the names of merohlastic and holollastic
 (meaning partially and entirely germinal) to these two contrasting forms of ova.

 There are many of the invertebrate animals of which the ova present the

 same entirely germinal arrangement as in those of mammals, and the Am-

pMo.vus may be included in the same group.

     The Amphibia stand in some measure between the two extremes-- the
 purely protoplasmic or germinal part occupying one side, and the nutritive or
 vitelline the other. But among the Invertebrates the gradations are often
 such as to make it difficult to determine under which group the ova should

 be placed.

     The genesis or formation of the ovum itself, if it be considered with refe-

  rence to its first origin, carries us back to a very early period of the develop-
 ment of the parent in which it is produced ; and it is one of the most
 interesting problems to determine what is the source of the cells in the parent
  from which the reproductive elements originally spring. All that I can ven-

  ture to say at present in regard to this point is, that the primordial ova or

germs appear in the parental body, while still embryonic, at a very early period
of its development, and clearly derivo their origin from a deeply-seated part
of the formative cells which are undergoing transformation into the primitive
organs ; but the exact seat of the origin of the two kinds of reproductive
cells is still a matter of doubt.

   When the ovum attains its full maturity in the ovary, the scat of its
formation within the parent, it is separated from that organ, and when fer-

tilized proceeds to undergo embryonic development, differing in this respect
from the germinal product of the higher plants, in which the embryo is deve-
loped in the place of formation of the seed.

   The period of maturation of the ovum is marked in the greater number
of animals by a series of phenomena which have generally been interpreted

as the extrusion or absorption of the germinal vesicle ; and various observers
have actually traced the steps of the process by which that vesicle appears
to leave the yolk and is lost to sight, or has passed into the space between
the yolk and its membrane in tho shape of the peculiar hyaline bodies named
the polar or directing globules. But recent researches, afterwards to be
referred to, tend to show that some part at least of the substance of the ger-

minal vesicle remains to form, when combined with the fertilizing element,
the newly endowed basis of future development.

   Among the earliest changes to which the perfect animal ovum is subject,

I have first to refer to the segmentation of the germ, a series of phenomena
the observation of which has been productive of most important results in
leading to a comprehension of the intimate nature of the formative process,
and which is of the deepest interest both in a morphological and histo-
logical point of view. This process, which was first distinctly observed by

Prevost and Dumas more than fifty years ago, and is now known to occur in

all animal ova, consists essentially in the cleavage or splitting up of the
protoplasmic substance of the yolk, by which it becomes rapidly subdivided
into smaller and more numerous elements, so as at last to give rise to the
production of an organized stratum of cells out of which, by subsequent
changes, the embryo is formed.

   The process of yolk-segmentation may at once be distinguished as of two

kinds, according as it affects in the small-yolked ova the whole mass of the
yolk simultaneously, or in the large-yolked ova is limited to only one part of
it. The cleavage process, in fact, affects the germinal and not the food-yolk

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

so that to take the two most contrasting instances of the bird and mammal,
to which I have before referred, it appears that while the mammal's ovum

undergoes entire segmentation, this process is confined to the substance of the
cicatricula or germinal disk of the bird's egg. This process is essentially one

of cell-division, but it is also in some measure ono of cell-formation. The
best idea of its nature will be obtained from a short description of the total
segmentation occurring in the mammal's ovum.
lxxxiv  --REPORT 1877.

   When, as before mentioned, the germinal vesicle has been in part ex-
truded or lost to sight, the -whole yolk-substance of the ovum forms a nearly-

uniform mass of finely granular protoplasm, enclosed within the external
cell-membrane. Within a few hours later a clear nucleus has arisen in this
mass. To this more definite form of organization assumed by the germinal
substance of the future animal, which is about to be the subject of the seg-

menting process, the name of the first segment-sphere may be given.
   By the process of cleavage which now begins, this first segment-sphere

and its nucleus undergo division into two nucleated spheres of smaller size,
the whole substance of the yolk, in a holoblastic ovum, such as that of the
mammal, being involved in the segmenting process.

   The second stage of division follows after the lapse of a few hours, and
results in the formation of four nucleated segment-spheres ; and the process

of division being repeated in a certain definite order, there result in the

succeeding stages (that is, the third, fourth, fifth, and up to the tenth) the
numbers of 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, and 96 nucleated yolk-spheres, germ-

spheres, or formative cells.

   In the rabbit's ovum the tenth stage is reached in less than three days ;
and as during that time the size of the whole ovum has undergone very little
increase, it follows that the spheres of each succeeding set, as they become
more numerous, have diminished greatly in size. These segment-spheres
are all destitute of external membrane, but are distinctly nucleated ; and their
protoplasmic substance is more or less granular, presenting the usual histo-

logical characters of growing cells.

   By the time that segmentation has reached the seventh or eighth stage,
when 32 or 48 spheres have been formed, the ovum has assumed the

appearance of a mulberry, in which the oi;ter smaller spheres, closely massed
together, project slightly and uniformly over the whole surface ; while the
interior of the ball is filled with cells of a somewhat larger size and a more
opaque granular aspect, also resulting from the process of segmentation.

    Already, however, the mutual compression of the spheres or cells on the
surface, by their crowding together, has led to the flattening of their adjacent

sides ; and by the time the tenth stage is reached, when the whole number
of the cells is about 96, the more advanced superficial cells, having ranged

themselves closely together, form a nucleated cellular layer or covering of
the yolk, enclosing within them the larger and more opaque cells, derived
like the first from the segmenting process. In a more advanced stage, the

deeper cells now referred to having taken the form of an internal layer, there

results at last the bilaminar blastoderm or embryonic germinal membrane.
    The process of partial segmentation, such as occurs in the bird's egg,

though perhaps fundamentally the same as that of the mammal previously

described, stands in a different relation to the parts of the whole yolk or
egg, and consequently differs in its general phenomena. The segmentation
       ADDRESS.                                                           l.XXKV

is mainly restricted in the meroblastic ova of birds to the germinal disk or
cicatricula, and does not immediately involve any part of the larger re-
mainder of the yolk. This takes place during the time of the descent of

the yolk through the oviduct, when the yolk is receiving the covering of the

--white or albumen, the membrane, and the shell, previous to being laid

process -which, in the common domestic fowl, usually occupies less than
twenty-four hours. Corresponding essentially to the more complete segmen-
tation of the mammal's ovum, the process leads to the same result in the

production of two layers of nucleated formative cells in the original seat of

--a protoplasmic disk a bilamiuar blastoderm resulting as in the mammal's

ovum, though in a somewhat different relation to the yolk.
    I will not fatigue you with a description of the details of these phenomena,

interesting as they may be, but only mention generally that they consist in the

formation of deep fissures with rounded edges running from the surface into the
substance of the germ-disk. The first of these fissures crosses the disk in
a determinate direction, dividing it into two nearly equal semicircular parts.
In the next stage another fissure, crossing the first nearly at right angles,
produces four angular segments. Then come four intervening radial fissures
which subdivide the four segments into eight ; and next afterwards the central
angles of these eight radial segments are cut off from their peripheral portions

by a different fissure, which may be compared to one of the parallels of latitude

on the globe near the pole where the radial or longitude fissures converge.

And so thereafter, by the succession and alternation of radial and circular

clefts (which, however, as they extend outwards, come soon to lose their
regularity), the whole germinal disk is divided into the two layers of nucleated
cells, constituting the blastoderma or germinal membrane of Pander and
subsequent embryologists *. If a laid egg be subjected to the heat of

incubation for eight or ten hours, the cicatricula, now converted into this

segmented blastoderm, is found to be considerably expanded by a rapid

multiplication of its constituent cells ; and in as many more hours, by further
changes in its substance, the first lineaments of the chick begin to make their
appearance. Similar changes affect the blastoderm of the mammal ; and thus
it appears that the result of segmentation, in the bird as well as in the mammal

and other animals, is the production of an organized laminar substratum,

which is the seat of the subsequent embryonic development.

   I must still request your attention to some details connected with the
process of segmentation, which bear upon the question of the origin of the

* The more exact nature of the process of segmentation was first made known by the

inli resting researches of Bagge in 1841, and more especially of Kolliker in 1843. The phe-

nomena of complete segmentation were first fully described in the mammal's ovum in

Bischoff's description of the development of the Babbit, 1842, and followed out in his

succeeding memoirs on the Dog, Guineapig, and Eoedeer. The phenomena of partial

segmentation were first made known, in their more exact form, by Kolliker's researches

on the development of the Cephalopoda, published in 1844. In birds the process was

first described by Bergmann in 1846, and more fully by Coste in 1848.

new cells, and on which recent research has thrown a new and unexpected

light.

   With respect to the nature of the first segment-sphere of the ovum and

the source of its nucleus, as well as of the other segment-spheres or cells
which follow each other in the successive steps of germ-suhdivision, it appears
probable, from the researches of several independent observers, and more

especially of Edward Tan Beneden and Oscar Hertwig, that in the course of

the extrusion of the germinal vesicle a small portion of it remains behind

in the form of a minute mass of hyaline substance, to which Yan Beneden
has given the name of pronucleus, and that, as the residt of the fertilizing

process, there is formed a second similar hyaline globule or pronucleus,
situated near the surface, which gradually travels towards the centre and
unites with the first pronucleus, and that these two pronuclei, being fused
together, form the true nucleus of the first segment-sphere. According to

this view the original germinal vesicle, when it disappears or is lost to sight,
as described by so many embryologists, is not dissipated, but only undergoes
changes leading to the formation of the new and more highly endowed nucleus

of the first embryonic or segmental sphere. It further appears that the sub-
division of each segmenting mass is preceded by a change and division of
the nucleus, and that this division of the nucleus is accompanied by the pe-
culiar phenomenon of a double conical or spindle-shaped radial lineation of the
protoplasm, which, if we were inclined to speculate as to its nature, seems
almost as if it marked out the lines of molecular force acting in the organizing
process. These lines, however, it will be understood, if visible with the
microscope, even of the highest magnifying-power yet attained, belong to

much larger particles than those of the supposed molecules of the physicist
but, considered in connexion with what we know of the movements which
frequently precede the act of division of the yolk-spheres, we seem in this
phenomenon to have made some near approach to the observation of the
direction in which the molecular forces operating in organization may be

 supposed to act*.

   With respect to the nature of the blastoderm, the organized cellular stratum
resulting from segmentation, and its relation to the previous condition of

of such deep interest that I am tempted to add here a short abstract of their more im-

portant results from a very clear account given of them by Dr. John Priestley, of

Owens College, Manchester, in the ' Journal of Microscopical Science ' for April 1876.

The researches now referred to are those of Auerbach, Butschli, Strasburger, Hertwig-,

and Edw. Van Beneden                                                                                                         and  the following  may be  stated  as  the  points  in  which  they

the ovum on the one hand, and the future embryo on the other, there is pre-
sented to us, by modern research, the interesting view that the blastoderm

--consists, after completion of the segmenting process, of two layers of cells an

outer or upper (usually composed of smaller, clearer, and more compact
nucleated cells), named ectoderm or ejpiblast, and an inner or lower (consisting
of cells which are somewhat larger, more opaque and granular, but also
nucleated), named endoderm or hypoblast.

    In the meroblastic ova, such as those of birds, the bilaminar blastoderm
is discoid and circumscribed as it lies on the yolk-surface, and only comes
to envelop the whole of the food-yolk in the progress of later development ;
while in the holoblastic ova, and more especially in mammals, the blastoderm
from the first extends over the whole surface of the yolk, and thus forms an

entire covering of the yolk known as the " vesicular blastoderm," the space

within being occupied by fluid.
   Huxley long ago presented the interesting view that these two layers are

essentially the same, in their morphological relations and histological structure,
as the double wall of the body in the simplest forms of animals above the
Protozoa. Haeckel has more recently followed out this view, supporting it by
his researches in the Calcareous Sponges, and has founded upon it his well-

known Gastrcea theory. According to this view all animals take their origin

from a form of Gastrula, or simple stomach-like cavity. In the lower tribes,

as in the instance of the common freshwater polype or Hydra, they proceed no

further than the Gaatrula stage, unless by mere enlargement and slight differ-

into two, and each half moves towards the pole of the spindle on its own side, there being
radiated lines of protoplasm between the poles and the equatorial disk.

   The disk segments are the new nuclei, and the subsequent division of the cell takes

place in the intermediate space.

   Although these observers still differ in opinion upon some of the details of this process,
and especially as to the fate of the germinal vesicle, all of them seem to agree that there
are two pronuclei or distinct hyaline parts of the yolk-protoplasm, a superficial and a
deep one, engaged in the formation of the new nucleus ; and both Hertwig and Van Bene-

den are of opinion that the two'proceed from different productive elements.

  The radiated structure of the nuclei had been previously recognized by Fol and Hem-

ming, and further observed by Oellacher.

entiation of the two primitive layers of cells representing the persistent

ectoderm and endoderm *.

If, pursuing this idea, we take a survey of the whole animal kingdom

in its long gradation of increasing complexity of form and structure from the

simplest animal up to man himself, we find that all the various modifications

of organic structure which present themselves are found, in the history of the

individual or ontological development of the different members of the series,

to spring originally from two cellular laminae, ectoderm and endoderm, the

component elements of which may again he traced back to the first segment-

sphere and primitive protoplasmic elements of the ovum.

Time does not admit of my conducting you through the chain of observa-

tion and reasoning by which Haeckel seeks to convince us of the universal

applicability of his theory ; but I cannot avoid calling your attention to the

extremely interesting relation which has been shown to exist between the

primary phases of development of the ovum and the foundation of the blasto-

derm in very different groups of animals, more especially by the researches

of Haeckel himself, of Kowalevsky, Edward Yan Beneden, and others, and

which has received most efficient support from the investigations and writings

of E. Ray Lankester in our own country ; so that now we may indulge

the well-grounded expectation that, notwithstanding the many and great

difficulties which doubtless still present themselves in reconciling various

forms with the general principle of the theory, wo are at least in the track

which may lead to a consistent view of the relations subsisting between the

ontogenetic, or individual, and the phylogenetic, or race history of the for-

mation of animals and of man.

In all animals, then, above the Protozoa, the ovum presents, in some form

or other, the bilamiuar structure of ectoderm and endoderm at a certain

stage of its development, this structure resulting from a process of segmen-

tation  or                                  cell-cleavage                                                       and  there  are  three  principal modes  in  which the

double condition of the layers is brought about. In one of these it is by

inward folding or invagination of a part of the single layer of cells immediately

resulting from the process of segmentation that the doubling of the layers is

produced                                    in the second, perhaps resolvable into the first, it may be described
                                         ;

rather as a process of enclosure of one set of cells within another ; while in
the third the segmented cells, arranged as a single layer round a central

cavity of the ovum, divide themselves later into two layers. But the dis-

tinction of ectodermic and endodermic layers of cells is maintained, whether

it be primitive and manifested from a very early period, or acquired later by

a secondary process of differentiation. Thus in many Invertebrates, as also

the views alluded to above are fully exposed in a series of most interesting memoirs, viz.

iu Ampliioxus among the Vertebrates, a distinct invagination occurs, ·while
in Mammals, as recently shown by Yan Beneden's most interesting observa-
tions in the rabbit's ovum, and probably also iu some invertebrates, the cells
of the ectoderm gradually spread over those of the endoderm during the pro-
gress of segmentation, and thus the endodermic comes to be enclosed by the

ectodermic layer of cells.

   From tho very uovel and unexpected observations of Yan Benedcn it further

appears that from the earliest period in tho process of segmentation in the

mammal's ovum it is possible to perceive a distinction of two kinds of seg-
ment-spheres or cells, and that when this process is traced back to its first

stage it is found that the whole of the cells belonging to the ectoderm are the
progeny of, or result from the division of the upper of the two first formed
segments, and that the whole of the endodermic cells are the descendants of
the lower of the two first segmented cells. This, however, is not an isolated
fact belonging only to mammalian development, but one which very nearly
repeats a process ascertained to occur in a considerable number of the lower
animals, and it seems to promise the means of greatly advancing the compre-
hension of the whole process of blastodermic formation. Thus ectoderm and
endoderm, which are in fact the primordial rudiments of the future animal
and vegetative systems of the embryo, are traced back as distinct from each
other to the first stage of segmentation of the germ.

   Accepting these facts as ascertained, they may be regarded as of the deepest

significance in the phylogenetic history of animals ; for they appear to open
up the prospect of our being able to trace transitions between the earliest
embryonic forms occurring in the most different kinds of ova, as between the
discoid or meroblastic and the vesicular or holoblastic, through the inter-

mediate series which may be termed amphiblastic ova*.

    In the lowest animals, the two layers already mentioned, viz. ectoderm

and endoderm, are the only ones known to constitute the basis of develop-
mental organization ; but as we rise in the scale of animals we find a new

feature appearing in their structure, which is repeated also in the history of
the formation of the blastoderm in the higher animals up to man. This
consists in the formation of an intermediate layer or layers constituting the
mesoderm, with which, in by far the greater number, is connected the forma-
tion of some of the most important bodily structures, such as the osseous,
muscular, and vascular systems.

    I will not stop to discuss the very difficult question of the first origin of the

mesoderm, upon which embryologists are not yet entirely agreed, but will

    * I ought here to refer to the elaborate memoirs of Professor Semper on the morpho-
 logical relatione of the Vertebrate and Invertebrate animals, contained in the ' Arbeiten
 aus dem Zoolog.-zootom. Institut in Wurzburg,' 1875 and 1876, in which the conclusions
 arrived at do not coincide with the views above stated.
XC REPORT 1877.

only remark that a view originally taken of this subject by the acute Von

--Baer appears more and more to gain ground ; and it is this that the meso-

derm, arising as a secondary structure, that is, later than the two primary
layers of ectoderm and endoderm (corresponding to the serous and mucous
layers of F'ander), is probably connected with or derived from both of these
primitive layers, a view which it will afterwards appear is equally important
ontogenetically and phylogenetically.

   But whatever may be the first origin of the mesoblast, we know that in

the Vertebrata this layer, separating from between the other two, and

acquiring rapidly by its cell-multiplication larger proportions and much

greater complexity than belongs to either ectoderm or endoderm, speedily
undergoes further subdivision and differentiation in connexion with tho
appearance of the embryonic organs which arise from it, and in this respect
contrasts greatly with the simplicity of structure which remains in the
developed parts of the ectodermic and endodermic layers. Thus, while
the ectoderm supplies the formative materials for the external covering or
epidermis, together with the rudiments of the central nervous organs and
principal sense-organs, and the endoderm by itself only gives rise to the
epithelial lining of the alimentary canal and the cellular part of the glands
connected with it, the mesoblast is the source of far more numerous and
complex parts, viz. the whole of the true skin or corium, the vertebral
column and osseous system, the external voluntary muscles and connective
tissue, the muscular walls of tho alimentary canal, the heart and blood-

vessels, the kidneys, and the reproductive organs, thus forming much the

greatest bulk of the body in the higher animals.
   There is, however, a peculiarity in the mode of the earliest development

of the mesoblast which is of great importance in connexion with the general

history of the disposition of parts in the animal body, to which I must now

refer. This consists in the division of the mesoblast in all but its central
part into two laininpe, an outer or upper and an inner or lower, and the separa-
tion of these by an interval or cavity which corresponds to the space existing
between the outer wall of our bodies and the deeper viscera, and which, from
the point of view of the vertebrate animals is called the pleuro-peritoneal

cavity, but, viewed in the more extended series of animals down to the Annu-
loida, may receive the more general appellation of pleuro-splanchnic or

parieto-visceral cavity, or, shortly, the coelom. Thus, from an early period
in the vertebrate embryo, and in a considerable number of tho invertebrate,
a division of the mesoderm takes place into the somatopleural or outer

--lamina and the splanchnopleural or inner lamina tho outer being the seat

of formation of the dermal, muscular, and osseous systems (the volunto-

motory of llemak), and the inner of the muscular wTall of the alimentary

canal, as well as of the contractile substance of the heart and tho vascular
system generally.

   It is interesting to find that there is a correspondence between the
later division of the mesoderm of the higher animals derived from the two
primitive blastodermic laminae and the original absence of mesodermic
structure in the lowest animals, followed by tho gradual appearance,
first of one layer (the external muscular in the higher Coelenterata), and
soon afterwards by the two divisions or laminae with the intermediate

ccelom.

   In this account of what may be termed the organized foundation of the
new being, I have entered into some detail, because I felt that our conception

of any relation subsisting between the ontogenetic history of animals and
their phylogenetic evolution can only be formed from the careful study
of the earliest phenomena of embryonic organization. Notwithstanding the

many difficulties which unquestionably still block the way, I am inclined
to think that thero is great probability in the view of a common bilaminar

origin for the embryo of all animals above the Protozoa, and that the

Vertebrate equally with the Invertebrate animals may be shown to possess,

in the first stages of their blastodermic or embryonic formation, tho two

primitive layers of ectoderm and endoderm*.

   To attempt, however, to pursue the history of the development of animals
in detail would be equivalent to inflicting upon you a complete system of
human and comparative anatomy. But I cannot leave the subject abruptly
without an endeavour to point out in the briefest possible manner the bearing
of some of the leading facts in embryology upon the general relation of onto-

geny and phylogeny.

  We are here brought into the contemplation of those remarkable changes,

all capable of being observed and demonstrated, by which the complex

organization of the body of man and animals is gradually built up out of the

elementary materials furnished by the blastodermic layers-- a process which
has been looked upon by all thoso who have engaged in its study with the
greatest interest and admiration. By comparing these phenomena as observed
in individuals belonging to different classes and orders of animals, it is
found that not only are they not different, but, on the contrary, that
they present features of the most remarkable resemblance and conformity,

and we are led to the conclusion that there is a general plan of development

proved to extend to the members of considerable groups, and possibly capable

of being traced from one group to another ; this being in fact equivalent to the
statement that there is a similar type of structure pervading the animals

of each group, and a probability of a common type being ascertained
to belong to them all. The main question, therefore, to be answered is
whether there is or is not a general correspondence between the phenomena
of development and the gradation of type in animal structure upon which

anatomists and zoologists are agreed ; and my object will now be to bring

rapidly before you one or two of the most marked illustrations of the
correspondence, drawn from the early history of development in the higher

animals.

   As one of the examples of the earlier phenomena of development I may

refer to the change which is perceptible as early as the 18th or 20th hour

of incubation in the chick, and which is reproduced in the course of develop-

ment of every member of the Yertebrate subkingdom. It consists in the

formation of cross clefts on each side of the primitive neural cavity, which

divide off from each other a number of segments of this wall in the length

of the axis of the embryo.  At first there are only one or two such clefts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but they rapidly increase in a backward direction in the body of the embryo,

and as development proceeds they extend into the tail itself. These

--are the protovertebrce of cmbryologists not corresponding, as might at

first be supposed, with the true or actual vertebra) which are formed later,

but representing in an interesting manner transverse vertebral segments

of the body, and containing within each the elements of the several

structures belonging to the body-wall afterwards to be developed, in-

cluding the true cartilaginous or osseous vertebral arches and the muscular

plates.

   This change, however, belongs to the mesodermic lamina, and occurs
in an elongated thick portion of it, which makes its appearance on each
side of the primitive neural canal between the epiblast and the hypoblast.
The transverse cleavage is ascertained to commence near what afterwards
forms the first cervical vertebra, but does not extend into the base of the

cranium. And it is most interesting to note in this cleavage the formation

at so early a period of the succession of metameres or series of similar parts,
which forms a main cb aracteristic of vertebral organization.

   As intimately connected with the formation of tho vertebral column, the
appearance of the chorda dorsalis or notochord presents many points of

peculiar interest in embryological inquiries.

   The notochord is a continuous median column or thread of cellular struc-

ture running nearly the whole length of the rudimentary body of the

embryo, and lying immediately below the cerebro-spinal canal. It occupies,

in fact, the centre of the future bodies of the vertebras. It exists as a pri-

mordial structure in the embryo of all Vertebrates, including man himself and
extending down to the Amphioxus, and, according to the remarkable discovery
ADDRESS.  *CU1

of Kowalevsky in 18G6, it is to to. found among the Invertebrates in the

larva of the Asoidia*.

   In Amphioxus and the Cyclostomatous Fishes the notochord, growing with
the rest of the body into a highly developed form, acts as a substitute for the
pillar of the bodies of the vertebrae, no vertebral bodies being developed ; but
in Cartilaginous and Osseous Fishes various gradations of cartilaginous and
osseous structures come to surround the notochord and give rise to the simpler
forms of vertebral bodies, which undergo more and more distinct development
in the higher vertebrates. In all instances the substance forming the vertebral
bodies is deposited on the surface of or outside the notochord and its sheath,
so that this body remains for a time as a vestigial structure within the

vertebral bodies of the higher animals.

   The observations of Kowalevsky with respect to the existence of a notochord
in the Ascidia, which have been confirmed by Kupfer and others, have pro-
duced a change little short of revolutionary in embryological and zoological

views, leading as they do to the support of the hypothesis that the Ascidian

is an earlier stage in the phylogenetic history of the mammal and other

Vertebrates. The analogy between the Amphioxus and Ascidian larva is
certainly most curious and striking as regards the relation of the notochord
to other parts ; and it is not difficult to conceive such a change in the form
and position of the organs in their passage from the embryonic to the adult
state as is not inconsistent with the supposition that the Yertebrates and
the Ascidia may have had a common ancestral form. Kowalevsky's discovery
opens up at least an entirely new path of inquiry ; and necessitates the modi-
fication of our views as to the entire separation of the Yertebrates from the
other groups of animals, if we do not at once adopt the hypothesis that
through the Ascidian and other forms the origin of the Yertebrates may bo

traced downwards in the series to the lower grades of animal organization.
   The notochord extends a short way forward into the cranial basis ; and an

interesting question here presents itself, beginning with the speculations of
Goethe and Oken, and still forming a subject of discussion, whether the series

of cranial or cephalic bones is comparable to that of the vertebra. On the
whole it appears to me that it is consistent with the most recent views of tho

development and anatomy of the head to hold the opinion that it is composed
of parts which are to some extent homologous with vertebral metameres f.

    The history of the formation of the vertebral column presents an interesting
 example of the correspondence in the development of the individual and the
race, in that all the stages which have been referred to as occurring in the
 gradual evolution of the vertebral column in the series of Yertebrates are

repeated in the successive stages of the embryonic development of the higher
members of the series.

    There is perhaps no part of the history of development in the Vertebrates
which illustrates in a more striking manner the similarity of plan which runs

through the whole of them than that connected with what I may loosely call

the region of the face and neck, including the apparatus of the jaws and gills.

The embryonic parts I now refer to consist of a series of symmetrical pairs of
plates which are developed at an early period below the cranium, and may

therefore, in stricter embryological terms, be styled the subcranial plates.
    Without attempting to follow oirt the remarkable changes which occur in

the development of the nose and mouth in connexion with the anterior set of
these plates (which, from being placed before the mouth, are sometimes
named preoral), I may here refer shortly to the history of the plates situated
behind the mouth, which were discovered by Rathke in 1826, and formed
the subject of an elaborate investigation by Eeichert in 1837.

   These plates consist of a series of symmetrical bars, four in number in
mammals and birds, placed immediately behind the mouth, separated by
clefts passing through the wall of the throat, and each traversed by a division

--of the great artery from the heart thus constituting the type of a branchial

apparatus, which in fishes and amphibia becomes converted into the well-known

gills of these animals ; whilst in reptiles, birds, and mammals they undergo

various changes leading to the formation of very different parts, which could
not be recognized as having any relation to gill-structure, but for the obser-
vation of their earlier embryonic condition. The history of this part of deve-
lopment also possesses great interest on account of the extraordinary degree

of general resemblance which it gives to the embryos of man and the most

different animals at a certain stage of advancement (so great, indeed, that it
requires a practised eye to distinguish between them though belonging to
different orders of mammals, and even between some of them and the embryos
of birds or reptiles), as well as in connexion with the transformations of the
first pair of branchial apertures, which lead to the formation of the passage
from the throat to the ear in the higher Vertebrata. There is equal interest
attached to the history of the development of the first pair of arches which
include the basis of formation of the lower jaw with the so-called cartilaye of
Meckel, and which, while furnishing the bone which suspends the lower jaw in

reptiles and birds, is converted in mammals into the hammer-bone of the ear.
   The other arches undergo transformations which are hardly less marvel-

lous, and the whole series of changes is such as never fails to impress the
embryological inquirer with a forcible idea of the persistence of type and
the inexhaustible variety of changes to which simple and fundamental parts

may be subject in the process of their development.

    It is also of deep significance, in connexion with the foregoing phenomena,

further multiplication of these metamoros or repeated parts in the Amphioxus ;
and it is interesting to note that in the Ascidia tho arrangement of the gills is
exactly similar to that of the Amphioxus.

   The study of the comparative anatomy of the heart and its mode of for-
mation in the embryo furnishes another striking illustration of the relation
between ontogenetic and phylogenetic development in the Vertebrates, and is
not without its applications to some of the invertebrate groups of animals.

    I need only recall to your recollection the completely doublo state of this
organ in warm-blooded animals, by which a regular alternation of the

--systemic and pulmonary circulations is secured, the series of gradations

through the class of Eeptiles by which we arrive at tho undivided ventricle

of the Amphibian, and the further transition in the latter animals by which
we come at last to the singlo heart of Fishes j and state that in the embryo
of the higher animals the changes by which the double heart is ultimately
developed out of an extremely simple tubular shape, into which it is at first
moulded from the primitive formative cells, are, in the inverse order, entirely

analogous to those which T have just now indicated as traceable in the

descending series of vertebrate animals ; so that at first the embryonic heart

of man and other warm-blooded animals is nothing more than a rhythmically
contractile vascular tube. By the inflection of this tube, the constriction of

its wall at certain parts, and the dilatation at others, the three chambers are
 formed which represent the single auricle, the single ventricle, and the aortic

bulb of the fish. By later changes a septum is formed to divide the auricles,

 becoming completed in all the air-breathing animals, but remaining incom-
 plete in the higher animals so long as the conditions of fcetal life prevent the
 return of arterialized blood to the left auricle. The growth of another septum
 within the ventricular portion gradually divides that cavity into two ven-
 tricles, repeating somewhat in its progress the variations observed in different
 reptiles, and attaining its complete state in the crocodile and warm-blooded

 animals.

     I must not attempt to pursue this interesting subject further; but I cannot
 avoid making reference to the instructive view presented by the embryo-
 logical study of the nature of the malformations to which the heart is sub-

 ject, which, as in many other instances, are due to the persistence of

 transitory conditions which belong to different stages of progress in the
 development of the embryo. Nor can I do more than allude to the interest-
 ing series of changes by which the aortic bulb, remaining single in fishes and
 serving as the channel through which the whole stream of blood leaving the
 heart is passed into the gills, becomes divided in the higher animals into the
 roots of the two great vessels, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, and the
xcvi               --REPORT 1877.

remarkable transformations of the vascular arches which proceed from the

aortic bulb along the several branchial arches, and which, in the gills of fishes

and aquatic Amphibia, undergo that minute subdivision which belongs to the

vascular distribution of gills, but which in the higher non-branchiated animals

are the subject of very different and various changes, in the partial obliteration

of some and the enlargement of others, by which the permanent vessels are

produced.

   These changes and transformations have for many years been a subject of

much interest to comparative anatomists, and will continue to be so, not only

from their presenting to us one of the most remarkable examples of confor-

mity in the plan of development and the type of permanent or completed

organization in the whole series of vertebrated animals, but also because of

the manifest dependence of the phenomena of their development upon ex-

ternal influences and atmospheric conditions affecting the respiration, nutri-

tion, and modes of life of the animal.

Nor is the correspondence to which I now refer entirely limited to the

Vertebrata. For here, again, through the Amphioxus and the Ascidia, we

come to see how an affinity may be traced between organs of circulation and

respiration which at first appear to belong to very different types. The

heart of vertebrates is, as is well known, essentially a concentrated form of

vascular development in the ventral aspect of the body, while the heart of

the invertebrate, whether in the more concentrated form existing in the

Articulata and Mollusca or in a more subdivided shape prevalent in the

Annelida, is most  frequently dorsal                                                               yet the main  aorta of the Vertebrates
                                                                                                ;

is also dorsal; and it is not impossible, through the intermediate form of

Amphioxus, to understand how the relation between the Vertebrate and the

Invertebrate type of the blood-vascular system may be maintained.

   But I am warned by the lapse of time that I must not attempt to pursue

these illustrations further. In the statement which I have made of some of

--the more remarkable phenomena of organic production too long, I fear, for
--your endurance, but much too brief to do justice to the subject it has been

my object mainly to show that they are all more or less closely related toge-

ther by a chain of similarity of a very marked and unmistakable character
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                j

that in their simplest forms they are indeed, in so far as our powers of obser-

vation enable us to know them, identical ; that in the lower grades of animal

and vegetable life they are so similar as to pass by insensible gradations into
each other ; and that in the higher forms, while they diverge most widely in
some of their aspects in the bodies belonging to the two great kingdoms of
organic nature, and in the larger groups distinguishable within each of them,
yet it is still possible, from the fundamental similarity of the phenomena, to

trace in the transitional forms of all their varieties one great general plan of

organization.

     Iii its simplest and earliest form that plan comprises a minute mass t f

the common nitrogenous hydrocarbon compound to which the name of

protoplasm has been given, exhibiting the vital properties of assimilation,
reproduction, and irritability. The second stage in this plan is the nucleated

Weand enclosed condition of the protoplasmic mass in the organized cell.

next recognize the differentiation of two productive elements, and their com-
bination for the formation of a more highly endowed organizing element in
the embryonic germ-sphere or cell ; and the fourth stage of advance in the
complexity of the organizing phenomena is in the multiplication of the fer-
tilized embryo-cell and its conversion into continuous organized strata, by
further histological changes in which the morphological foundations of the
future embryo or new being are laid.

   I need not now recur to the further series of complications in the formative

process by which the bilaminar blastoderm is developed and becomes trila-
minar or quadrilaminar, but only recall to your recollection that while these
several states of the primordial condition of the incipient animal pass insen-
sibly into each other, there is a pervading similarity in the nature of the his-
tological changes by which they are reached, and that in the production of the
endless variations of form assumed by the organs and systems of different
animals in the course of their development, the process of cell-production,
multiplication, and differentiation remains identical. The more obvious
morphological changes are of so similar a character throughout the whole,

and' so nearly allied in the different larger groups, that we cannot but
regard them as placed in some very close and intimate relation to the

inherent properties of the organic substance which is their seat, and the
over-present influence of the vital conditions in which alone these properties

manifest themselves.

   The formative or organizing property therefore resides in the living sul>
stance of every organized cell and in each of its component molecules, and is
a necessary part of the physical and chemical constitution of the organizing
elements in the conditions of life ; and it scarcely needs to be said that these

conditions may be as varied as the countless numbers of the molecules which

compose the smallest particles of their substance. But, setting aside all

speculation of a merely pangenetic kind, it appears to me that no one could

have engaged in the study of embryological development for any time without
becoming convinced that the phenomena which have been ascertained as to
the first origin and formation of textures and organs in any individual animal
arc of so uniform a character as to indicate forcibly a law of connexion
and continuity between them ; nor will his study of the phenomena of
development in different animals have gone far before he is equally strongly
convinced of the similarity of plan in the development of the larger groups,
and, to some extent, of the whole. I consider it impossible therefore for any

one to bo a faithful student of embryology, in the present state of science,
xcviii  --report 1877.

·without at the same time hecoming an evolutionist. There may still be mam-
difficulties, some inconsistencies, and much to learn, and there may remain
beyond much which we shall never know ; but I cannot conceive any doctrine
professing to bring the phenomena of embryonic development within a general

law which is not, like the theory of Darwin, consistent with their fundamental
identity, their endless variability, their subjugation to varying external in-
fluences and conditions, and with the possibility of tho transmission of the
vital conditions and properties, with all their variations, from individual to
individual, and, in the long lapse of ages, from race to race.

    I regard it, therefore, as no exaggerated representation of the present state
of our knowledge to say that the ontogenetic development of the individual

in the higher animals repeats in its more general character, and in many
of its specific phenomena, the phylogenetic development of the race. If we

admit the progressive nature of the changes of development, their simi-

larity in different groups, and their common characters in all animals, nay,
even in some respects in both plants and animals, we can scarcely refuse

to recognize the possibility of continuous derivation in the history of their

origin ; and however far we may be, by reason of the imperfection of our

knowledge of Palasontology, Comparative Anatomy, and Embryology, from
realizing the precise nature of tho chain of connexion by which the actual
descent has taken place, still there can be little doubt remaining in the minds
of any unprejudiced student of embryology that it is only by the employment
of such an hypothesis as that of Evolution that further investigation in these
several departments will be promoted, so as to bring us to a fuller compre-
hension of the most general law which regulates the adaptation of structure

to function in the Universe.

       [Plate L]

The Committee in their Twelfth Report, read at Glasgow last year*, brought
up the history of their researches to the end of August 1S76. They have
now the pleasure of continuing that history to the end of July 1877.
During the intervening eleven months the work has been continued without
interruption, on the same method and under the same daily superintendence
as heretofore. The ·workmen named in the Twelfth Report, George Smerdon
(foreman) and William Matthews, are still employed on the exploration,

and coutinuc to give unqualified satisfaction.

   On the 2nd November, 1870, Mr. Busk, a member of the Committee,

visited the Cavern, accompanied by one of the Superintendents, -when he
inspected that portion of the work which was then in progress, as well as the

principal parts where the exploration has been completed.

   The researches continue to attract large numbers of visitors, most of whom

are admitted by the authorized guide, who, under well-defined and strictly
observed regulations, conducts them through such branches of the Cavern
as are of general and popular interest, but not to those in which the work is
in actual progress or has not been begun.

  --In addition to the foregoing, the following visitors Ixave been accompanied

by one of the Superintendents: The Revs. T. G. Bonncy, A. N. Mackray,

The Bears Den.--The Chamber termed " The Bear's Den " by the Bev.

J. MacEnery measures about 67 feet in length, from north to south nearly,
from 8 to 38 feet in width, and from 8 to 15 feet in height, the last dimen-

sion being measured, as everywhere else in the Cavern, from the bottom of

the excavation. The limestone roof is extremely rugged, fretted, and water-

worn. The "Lake"* opens out of the north-eastern corner of the Den,

and nearly opposite, in the western wall, is the eastern mouth of the " Great

Oven" t. On the same side as, and immediately south of, the latter opening

is a vast boss of stalagmite, which the (Superintendents of the work have

preserved intact.

This boss is crowded with inscriptions, most of which are, unfortunately,

difficult to decipher, partly because they cross one another, and also becauso

they are much scratched, apparently by the nailed shoes of visitors. The

--following, however, have been distinctly made out :

1. " William Pctre, 1571."

2. « A. T., 1662."
3. " I. Bertie, 1706 " (in a rude segment of a circle, of which the chord is

8'5 inches, and the height 5 - 5 inches).

4. " I. B., 1706 " (in a rectangular figure, 2 x 1"5 inches).

5. " A. Chard, 1817."

6 " B. D., 1822."

7. < : W. Crew."

8. " S. Crocker."

9. " F. Davy." (In lotters 6 inches high, produced apparently with a series

Yof blows with a pointed hammer. The last letter is by inference only.
-- VIts place is occupied by a triangle placed thus
                                                     , formed by the complete

removal of a thin lamina of the stalagmite. This removal was probably
accidental, and caused with the unintentional effect of the blows of the hammer

in the attempt to form the Y.)

10. " Anton Hay."
11. " Dauid More " (in engrossed letters).

12. " John Skinner."
13. " F. D." (within a heart-shaped figure, measuring 5-5 inches from the

indent to the point opposite, and 5 inches in greatest breadth).

14. " W. B."

15. " W. E."

There is also a date belonging to the second decade of the 17th century,

but to what precise year cannot bo determined, as the right or units numeral
is not decipherable. All that can be made out is 161 [?].

No. 1 is of considerable interest on two accounts :
First. The date, 1571, is, so far as is at present known, the earliest in the

Cavern, and the only one belonging to tho 16th century.

   Second. Its genuineness can scarcely be doubted, as it is known that there

were at the period in question two natives of South Devon named William

Petre-- Sir "William Petro, the statesman, -who obtained the manor of Brent,
near Totnes, at the dissolution of Buckfast Abbey, about 1553 ; and William
Petro, his nephew.

  --Mr. It. Dymond, F.S.A., of Exeter, writing to the Superintendents on the

question, says : " Sir Wm. Petre, the statesman, does not appear to have

maintained much connexion with Devonshire after attaining manhood ; and
as the date of the inscription in Kent's Cavern (1571) was that of the year

preceding his interment in Essex, it would seem unlikely that it referred to

him.

   " On the other hand, there is much that points to the conclusion that it was
the work of William Petre, his nephew, who owned Hays in St. Thomas, a
suburb of Exeter, but who was described as of Tor Newton, and was buried

at Tor Brian, near Totnes, in 1614. His mother was a ltidgway of Tor-
mohun, the parish in which the Cavern is situate ; and his wife was a
South cote of Bovey Tracy, South Devon. Thomas Bidgway, the then owner
of the land which contains Kent's Hole, was the trustee of his marriage

settlement in 1585. He probably held frequent intercourse with these con-

nexions, and was familiar with the objects of interest on their property.
His monumental inscription (see Prince's ' Worthies of Devon,' p. 633) docs
not state his ago, but he died in 1614. His marriage settlement was

apparently a postnuptial one; and he was probably young in 1571, when
the youthful freak of carving the name in stalagmite was perpetrated.

   " May we not fairly conclude that he was identical with the ' William
Petre ' of the Cavern?--B. D., 20th May, 1877."

   It may not be out of place to add here that Mr. J. T. "White, whilst
preparing his ' History of Torquay,' discovered a lease dated December 22nd,

1659, and appertaining to " closes, melds, or pieces of ground" forming part
of the property in which the Cavern is situate, in which occur the words
" one close caUed Kent's Hole ; " thus showing that in the middle of the 17th

century the Cavern was so well known as to have given a name to a portion

of an estate leased to a " husbandman," and rendering it eminently probable

that the inscription of 1571, and all those of subsequent date, may be taken

as genuine.

   As Mr. MacEnery broke ground in every part of the Bear's Den, the con-
dition in which he found it can only be learned from the description which
he has left, and which may be given in the following very condensed form :
" The floor of the Boar's Den was studded with conical mounds of stalagmite,

supporting corresponding pendants from the roof. Fallen masses of limestone

were strewed about, and some of them wore incorporated in the crust. An

irregular sheet of stalagmite, about a foot thick, overspread the floor, and
was based on a shallow bed of indurated rubble, containing tubes of stalactite
 collected in heaps in particular places, a great abundance of album grcecum,

an unusual proportion of Bears' teeth, and an iron blade much corroded,

 Points of stalagmitic cones were observed to protrude upwards into the
 rubbly bed, and 'were found to rise from a lower sheet of stalagmite. Tho
 cones of this lower sheet were precisely under those of the upper, denoting
 that they were successively deposited from the same tubes above ; but the
 lowermost set exceeded by double the thickness of tho uppermost, and the
 depth of the stalagmitic sheet was in the same proportion. The lower sheet
 extended over the entire area of the den ; but the superincumbent bed of
 rubble, and its overlying thin sheet of stalagmite, disappeared gradually or
 ' thinned out ' towards the sides. The removal of these partial beds displayed
 the entire surface of the lower sheet, which exhibited a most singular

                                                                                    b2

appearance. Over the whole area it was cracked into large slabs, resembling

flags in a pavement. The upper sheet was not in the least fractured. The

average thickness of the cracked sheet was about two feet. It possessed the

hardness of rock, and, but for its division into insulated flags, it would have

been almost impossible to pierce it. Powder made no impression on it.

" The first flag we turned over displayed a curious spectacle. Skulls and

bones of Bear, crowded together, adhered to its under surface. Flag after

flag disclosed the same phenomenon ; but in one place numerous skeletons

lay heaped on  each  other                               the entire vertebral column and its various other
                                                      ;

bones, even to the phalanges and claws, were discovered lying in their natural

relation in a state of preservation as if belonging to the same individual.

The remains of Bear prevailed here to the exclusion of all other animals.

Some of the teeth were of the most dazzling enamel, and the bones of their

natural fresh colour. Others, on the contrary, were of a darkish brown

even the enamel was of a greenish tinge. Owiug to the induration of their

earthy envelope, or their incrustation by stalagmite, few were extracted

entire. Two skulls were buried in the stalagmite as in a mould, and were

brought away in that state. In no case were the remains broken or gnawed

by the jaws of Carnivores. The long bones were generally found entire,

and when observed broken it was only mechanically from pressure. The

bones were highly mineralized, heavy, brittle, easy of fracture, and when

struck rang like metallic substances." (See ' Trans. Devon Assoc' vol. iii.

(1869) pp. 233-10, 272-4, and 307-16.)

   " The annexed section," says Mr. MacEnery, " will indicate the relative
arrangement or position of the alternating strata of stalagmite and loam "

(ibid. p. 311). It must not be supposed, however, that the section makes

any thing like an approach to accuracy of scale or proportions (Plate I.).

The portions of the Stalagmitic Floor which Mr. MacEnery had faded to

break up, chiefly adjacent to the walls and other confines of the Bear's Don,

were sufficient to furnish the Committee with two good examples of tho

remarkably cracked condition of which he speaks. One of these was in the

north-east corner, where a crack about half an inch wide extended from

wall to wall, dividing the Bear's Den from the " Lake" area, passing quite

through the stalagmite, which was nowhere less than 2 feet thick, but

Avitkout " faulting " it in the slightest degree, or, so far as could bo observed,

in any way affecting the underlying deposits. Mr. MacEnery, however,

states, though somewhat obscurely, that iu some instances a derangement

had taken place in the materials covered by the broken stalagmite (ibid.

p. 301)). The second existing crack varies from '25 inch to 2-5 inches wide,

and passes completely through the boss of stalagmite already mentioned, but

without faulting it. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that there is no

unoccupied space between the base of this boss and the deposit beneath it.

The two arc in direct and undisturbed contact. No such cracks appear to

be mentioned by Mr. MacEnery as occurring elsewhere, nor have the Com-

mittee met with any thing of the kind in any other branch of the Cavern.

Tho ground broken by Mr. MacEnery extended to a depth of from 8 to

20 inches over almost the entire area of the Bear's Den. As was his wont,

he left the excavate! materials almost where he found them, and, as in all

previous cases of the kind, there were amongst them a large number of

specimens which had been overlooked or neglected. These, Carefully

collected by the Committee, were kept apart from the relics they found in

the deposits below his diggings, and, when the exploration of the Den was

completed) such was their number and volume that a horse and cart were
                     on rent's cavern, Devonshire.                        6

required for their removal from the Cavern. They included 1 tooth of Horse,
1 of Fox, 2 teeth of Deer, 4 of Hyscna, 4 of Mammoth, upwards of 200 of Bear,
very numerous hones, especially of the vertebral column and feet, a crowd of
broken bones and bone splinters, numerous balls of coprolite, and a few bits

of coarse pottery.

   It cannot be doubted that such cracks as Mr. MacEnery describes, if at all

approaching in width to that still existing in the Stalagmitic boss, must be a

possible, and, indeed, probable source of uncertainty respecting the position

and relative chronology of some of the objects found in the underlying

deposit, especially  if,  as  he  states, this  deposit  shared  in  the  disturbance
                                                                                                                               ;

for it must be supposed that portions of the overlying Cave-earth or, as Mr.

MacEnery calls it, the Rubble-bed, together with teeth, bones, and coprolites,
such as he found in it, would pass down through the cracks, and be lodged

oh, and perhaps in, the underlying Breccia.
   In accordance with Mr. MacEncry's description and the foregoing con-

siderations, the deposit the Committee had to excavate was the Breccia, with

a small amount of Cave-earth lying on it here and there. Fallen blocks of

limestone were extremely numerous ; many of them were of great size, and

required to be blasted before they could be removed ; whilst others, still larger,
penetrated the Breccia below the depth to which the excavation was carried,

and were allowed to remain undisturbed.

   The excavation in the Bear's Den was limited, as in other branches of the

Cavern, to a depth of four feet below the bottom of the Stalagmite, and the

Limestone Floor was nowhere reached.

   The "finds" in tho Den were 216 in number, of which 12 were in the

Stalagmite, 101 in the first or uppermost foot-level of the underlying

deposits, 47 in the second, 32 in the third, 23 in the fourth or lowest,

and 1 in a small recess in the north-west corner of the Den, where no

attempt was made to define the exact position of the objects. Omitting
those found in the Stalagmite and the Recess, 32 of the " finds " were in

Cave-earth, 05 in a mixture of Cave-earth and Breccia, and 96 in the Breccia,

whilst the matrix of the remaining 10 must be regarded as uncertain. The

colour and other characters of the specimens, however, indicate with toler-

able certainty to what beds and eras they belong.

Besides a considerable number of bones and pieces of bone representing

every part of the skeleton, the specimens included upwards of G20 teeth of

Bear, 24 of Hyaena, 10 of Horse, 7 of Fox, 5 of Mammoth, 4 of Lion, and 1 of
Dog (?) or Wolf (?). There were also 20 " finds " of coprolite and 11 flints.

   Amongst the bones, the skull of a Bear may be mentioned, which, to

requotc the language of Mr. MacEnery, was " buried in the stalagmite as in

a mould, and was brought away in that state." Many of the specimens arc
of considci'able interest, but, perhaps, none of them differ so much from those

mentioned in previous Reports as to require detailed description. There is,

however, a portion of a large canine tooth, probably of Bear, which is note-

worthy as having been apparently chipped artifically. From its colour and
general characters, it belonged to the breccia, or oldest known deposit ; but

it was met with, as part of " find " No. 6993, in the cave-earth, with two

teeth of Hyaena and a coprolitic ball, on 9th of June, 1 S77. Specimens similar
in character, and found under corresponding conditions, have been previously
met with in the Cavern, and were first pointed out by Professor Boyd
Dawkins, a member of the Committee, in 1SG8.

   None of the flints found in the Bear's Den are of so much interest
as many of those exhumed in other branches of the Cavern, and described
--6 REPORT 1877.

in previous lleports. Tho following, however, deserve more than a passing

notice :

   No. 6895 is a small, delicately-proportioned, white, flake tool, 1*75 inch
long, -6 inch in greatest width, which it retains for about two thirds of its

length, and 2# inch in greatest thickness. Both its ends are blunt, but its

edges are sharp ; the inner face is almost flat, whilst the outer is strongly
ridged. It was found in the first " foot-level," with 6 teeth of Bear and 1 of

Mammoth, on 1st November, 1876, and is undoubtedly a true Cave-earth

implement.

No. 6929 is an irregular rolled flint nodule, from which two flakes have

boon dislodged since it ceased to be exposed to any action capable of scratching

its facets or injuring its edges. It is about 2-5 inches long, 1*4 inch in

greatest breadth, 1-1 inch in greatest thickness, and was found, without any
object of interest near it, in the Breccia, or lowest known deposit, in the
fourth or lowest " foot-level," on 17th November, 1876. It has the dark,
manganic smutty surface which occasionally characterizes the Breccia tools.

   No. 6943 is a white flake implement, 2-2 inches long, "5 inch in greatest

breadth, and -3 inch in greatest thickness. It is broadest at one end, whence

it gradually tapers towards the other, but is somewhat scimitar-shaped in

outline, and has lost its point. It is nearly flat on one face, but is strongly
ridged on the other, whence three longitudinal flakes have been dislodged,

and its lateral margins are thin and sharp. It was found on 28th November,
1876, in tho Cave-earth, in the first " foot-level," with relics of Bear, Elephant,

and Hysena.

No. 6986 is a white flake, 1 inch long, -6 inch wide, and "2 inch in greatest

thickness. It is a parallelogram in outline ; slightly convex on the inner

face,  doubly  ridged  on  the  outer                   quite thin at the lateral  margins, one of
                                                     ;

which is somewhat notched, from which the other is free ; thick at each end,

and is in all probability the central portion of a tool of greater length. It

was found with 4 teeth of Bear, 1 of Hyama, and pieces of bono, on 30th

December, 1876, iu the first " foot-level," and belongs to tho Cave-earth

series.

   No. 6997 is a cherty flint nodule implement, 3-2 inches long, 2-5 inches in

greatest breadth, and 1*8 inch in greatest thickness. It may be described as

a somewhat sharply-pointed, rudely heart-shaped tool, retaining some of its

original surface as a rolled nodule. It was found on 10th January, 1877,
in the second " foot-level," without any object of interest near it, in the

Breccia, and is characteristic of that deposit.

No. 7040 is a very rough specimen, 2-75 inches long, 1-6 inch in greatest

breadth, and *95 inch in greatest thickness. It retains remnants of the
original surface of the nodule, and was found in the Breccia, in tho first
"foot-level," without any object of interest near it, on 5th March, 1877.

No. 7059 is 2 inches long, 1-1 inch in greatest breadth, and ·(> inch in

greatest thickness. It is irregularly convex on each face, pointed at one

end and rounded at the other, and retains traces of the original surface of
the nodule. It was found in tho Breccia, in the second " foot-level," without

any object of interest near it, on 15th March, 1877.

  A column or pillar of stalagmite was met with in November 1870,

adjacent to the cast wall of the Bear's Den, and about 22 feet from its

--northern end, under the following peculiar circumstances : It measured

about 51 inches in basal circumference and 3-75 feet in height. The base was

of nondescript outline, but everywhere above it the pillar was rudely ellip-

tical in horizontal section, and it measured 30 inches in girth at the height
on kent'b cavern, Devonshire:  ·

of 2 foot, where it was least. When found, however, it was in two parts,

having been divided along an almost horizontal plane where it was thinnest.
Each of the segments stood perfectly erect, but not one on the other ; for
though the bottom of the upper segment was on precisely the same level as
the top of the lower, the upper portion had been moved towards the right, or
west, to tho extent of 15 inches horizontally, and stood there on the Breccia.
In other words, the pillar had been " faulted," so to speak, about 5 inches
more than its thickness. It cannot be doubted that when the dislocation

--occurred the pillar had reached its full height, and the Breccia had accumu-

lated round it to the height of 2 feet that is, it had reached the level of the
plane of fracture. It is difficult to see how, by any possibility, the deposit
could at that time have reached a greater height, and difficult also to under-

stand how any thing other than human hands could have shifted the upper
segment of the pillar and placed it so as to preserve its erect position. On
the other hand, it is just as difficult to see what motive man could have had
for such a work. The whole pillar, when found, was completely buried in
the Breccia, and the top of tho upper segment was about a foot below the
bottom of the thick remnant of the Stalagmitic Floor, which Mr. MacEnery

had left intact, and which contained no cracks of any kind.
   Rats still continue to follow the workmen into the Cavern. The foreman,

George Smerdon, whose special work is that of excavating the deposits, uses
a lump of clay, but little, if at all, less than 2 lbs. in weight, as his candle-
stick ; and when ho leaves work he removes the candle and places it in a
box lest it should be carried off by rats, a precaution which experience has
taught him to be necessary ; but the lump of clay, which, it is needless to
say, is more or less covered with candle-grease, he leaves to its fate. During
the latter end of February and beginning of March 1877 he observed
every morning that, not only had the candle-grease been removed during
the nigh,t, but almost half of the clay (that is, nearly a pound in weight)
had disappeared also, as if it had formed a part of the meal of the depredator
or depredators. Having observed no rats for some time, he was inclined
to ascribe the work to bats, of which he had frequently seen several flying
about. On Saturday, 10th March, however, seeing a rat crossing tho Bear's
Den, he at once prepared a gin for it, and when he next entered the

Den he found the rat was caught.

  --The Tortuous Gallery. As soon as tho work in the Bear's Den was

completed, the exploration of a narrow passage opening out of its southern

end, and termed " The Tortuous Gallery," was begun. At and near the

entrance this Gallery is from 13 to 15 feet high ; but at 11 feet from tho

Bear's Den a second, or branch, Gallery presents itself, almost immediately
 above it, the two being divided by a continuous sheet of limestone, forming
the floor of one and the ceiling of the other. The branch extends, with

some irregularities of direction, towards the south-cast for a distance of

30 feet, where it becomes too narrow for a man to pass. Immediately

 beyond this point it is seen to be somewhat broader, but its further character
 and length are unknown. At tho entrance, where its dimensions are
 greatest, it is 7 feet high and 3 feet broad. Throughout its entire accessible
length its walls and roof have .strongly marked indications of the action
 of water. With the exception of a few largo blocks of limestone, it was

 entirely empty.

    The principal gallery, "The Tortuous Gallery"' proper, after throwing off

 a second and lower branch towards the west, turns sharply towards the
--8 hepokt 1877.

cast at a distance of 23 feet from the Bear's Den; and at 11 feet further it

expands into a small Chamber, the floor of which is a pavement of bloeks of
limestone, some of them of considerable size. The Gallery varies from to

8 feet high, and from 1*5 to 4 - 5 feet wide, and has obviously bceu a -water-
course. Ground had been broken here and there by the earlier explorers
up to 11 feet from the Bear's Den. Everywhere further in there was a

continuous unbroken Floor of Stalagmite, from 1-5 to 3-5 feet below the

limestone roof; but at 3 feet beyond the point at which, as already stated,

the Gallery turns eastward, an unoccupied interspace was found. between
the lower surface of this Floor and the top of the underlying deposit. At
first this hiatus did not exceed a foot, but as the work progressed it gradually

reached 4 feet.

The underlying deposit was exclusively the Breccia, or, so far as is known,

the oldest the Cavern contains. Its upper surface formed a continuous

declivity, so great that at the small Chamber previously mentioned the level

--was 103 inches below that of the nearest part of the Bear's Den a mean

gradient of 1 in 2"5. For the first 9 feet the thickness of the Breccia was

not more than from 3 to 3- 5 feet, the limestone floor being everywhere

reached within tbese limits; but elsewhere the ordinary four-feet sections

failed to disclose the limestone.

The "finds" met with in the Tortuous Gallery up to tho end of August

L877 were but 14 in number, and the objects they contained were of but

little importance: G of them were met with in the first or uppermost foot-

level (all near the entrance), 2 in the third, and 6 in the fourth (all at

some distance from the entrance"). They included, besides bones and bone-

chips, 14 teeth of Bear, some of them being in portions of jaws, and 1 of

Horse. The latter was found on the surface, near the Bear's Den, with 3
A --bits of coarse, friable, black pottery.
                                    "core" of black flint in nil pro-
--bability a " strike-light " of the present century was found under the same

conditions about a foot from them.

   On reviewing the work of the last eleven months the Superintendents

cannot but express disappointment at not having found the very large

number of choice specimens which Mr. MaeEncry's glowing description
had led them to expect in the Bear's Den. Nevertheless the discoveries
they have made not only justify his description, but show that in that branch
of the Cavern the osseous remains were almost entirely confined to the
uppermost foot of the Breccia, and mainly to its actual surface. So long as
the lower levels remained untouched, the belief that they were equally rich
would have naturally prevailed; and it cannot be doubted that in disposing
of this belief very satisfactory work has been done.

   The Committee have again to state that since their last Beport was pre-
sented they have found no relic of Machairodus latidens. It is satisfactory,
however, to know that since the last Meeting of the Association the crown
of a canine tooth of this species has been found, by the Bev. J. M. Mello, in

ltobin-Hood Cave, Creswell Crags, Derbyshire.

ON THE ESTIMATION or POTASH ANJ) PHOSPHORIC ACID.  9

Second Report of a Committee, consist imj of E. C. C. Stanford,

   James Dewar, Alfred E. Fletcher, E. W. Parnell, T. R.
   OgilviEj and Alfred II. Allen (Secretary), appointed to inquire

   into the Methods employed in the Estimation of Potash and Phos-
   phoric Acid in Commercial Products and the mode of stating the

   Results. Drawn up by Alered H. Allen *.

                                      Determination of Potash.

   The evidence on this subject obtained previously to the lust meeting of the
Association (Bristol) showed that the method of determining potassium by
precipitation as a platinum salt was almost universally employed by chemists
of large experience in the assay of potash salts. The Committee thought it
desirable, therefore, to subject the process to an exhaustive examination, with
a view of ascertaining the origin of the discrepancies known to occur
between the results of chemists using different modifications of the general
method of estimation by platinum chloride.

   Tho process of determining potassium by platinic chloride is well known

to depend on the sparing solubility of chloroplatinatc of potassium and tho
easy solubility of the ehloroplatinates of the associated metals. The pre-

cipitate is crystalline, of a bright yellow colour, and is easily dried. On

account of its solubility in aqueous liquids it is necessary to operate on con-

centrated solutions and to employ alcohol for washing. When the precipitate

is produced suddenly by addition of platinic chloride to a concentrated solu-
tion of potassium chloride, or by rapidly cooling a hot saturated aqueous
solution of potassium chloroplatinatc, it is obtained in a finely granular or

pulverulent form. When the chloroplatinatc is formed by gradual concen-

tration of a dilute aqueous solution, or by adding chloride of platinum to a
dilute solution of chloiide of potassium and then concentrating, the precipi-
tate assumes the form of dense crystalline scales, the subsequent manipulation

of which is very easy.
   The following modifications of the general process have been employed by

the Committee with the view of testing their comparative accuracy under

various conditions likely to occur in practice.

    The information forming the basis of the experiments was communicated
to the Committee chiefly dining last year, and to a great extent was
incorporated in the Eeport presented at the Bristol Meeting.

  --Modification I. Essentially the process of Professor Presenilis described
--in his ' Manual of Quantitative Analysis,' being shortly as follows : The

solution of mixed chlorides of potassium and sodium, freed, if necessary,
from calcium, magnesium, and sulphates, was evaporated nearly to dryness

with excess of solution of platinic chloride. (In many of the experiments
a considerable excess of platinum was employed beyond the quantity required

to convert both the alkali metals into ehloroplatinates.) The evaporated
solution was then treated with alcohol of about 80 per cent., allowed to
stand for some time, transferred to a small filter, washed with alcohol of
80 per cent., and carefully dried. The bulk of the precipitate was then
transferred to a weighed capsule, dried at 100° C, and weighed. Tho filter
with from 1 to 3 milligrammes of adherent precipitate was ignited, the
weight of the filter-ash (-0004 gramme) subtracted, and the residue of

+Pt+2KC1 calculated to rtCl, 2KCl, the amount thus obtained being added

to the main quantity.

                                    * Kc;d at the Meeting at Glasgow, 1876.
10 REPORT 1877.

  --Modification II. The above process, with the following precautious, was

recommended by Dr. Presenilis in a communication to this Committee :
   " To make sure not to keep any chloride of sodium along with the chloride

of platinum and potassium, I first extract the chloride of platinum and
sodium with spirits of wine of 80°, and then wash the chloride of platinum
and potassium with a few cub. ccntims. of water, drop by drop ; then I
evaporate this solution, adding a little chloride of platinum, treat the small
precipitate again with spirit of wine, and add the small quantity of chloride

--of platinum and potassium to the bulk."
   Modification III. The third modification is that of Drs. Frank and
Berrand, of Leopoldshall. These chemists employ only about *2 grm. of the
potash salt, and manipulate like Freseuius, but they wash the precipitate
with alcohol of 98 per cent., which is practically absolute. They dry tho

--precipitate at 110° C.
   Modification IV. The fourth modification is that of Mr. It. E. Tatlock,

Awho thus describes it in his communication to the Committee :--" portion

of the solution, equal to 10 grains of the original sample, is delivered into a
small basin, diluted with 400 grains or so of water, and acidified slightly
with hydrochloric acid. About 500 grains of platinic chloride solution (con-
taining at least 25 grains of platinum) are added, and the fluid evaporated

Anearly to dryness on a water bath. few drops of water are then added to the

residue, and the evaporation repeated to expel the excess of hydrochloric
acid. About 50 grains more of tho strong platinic solution arc mixed with
the precipitate, and the whole stirred well and set aside in a cold place for
at least an hour, with occasional stirring. The precipitate is then thrown on
a very small filter (unweighed), the basin rinsed out with about 10 drops
more of the platinum solution, and the precipitate on the filter washed with
10 or 15 drops more. The basin and the filter and contents arc then washed
with the smallest possiblo quantity of alcohol of 95 per cent, strength, and
dried at 100° C. The dried precipitate is transferred as completely as
possible to a small capsule, in which it is further dried until it assumes a
distinct, orange colour, and weighed. The filter, with a trace of adhering
precipitate, is ignited on a crucible lid, and the residual metal, with its cor-
responding chloride of potassium, calculated to potassio-platinic chloride, and
the weight added to that of the precipitate."

   From the above descriptions it will be seen that tho chief points of

difference in the processes arc as follows :

    Freseuius (Process I.) uses moderately strong alcohol (80 per cent.) for
washing the precipitate ; but in his modified process he subsequently uses a few
centimetres of water, and recovers any potassium salt thus dissolved.

   Frank and Berrand use a very small weight of the sample and wash with
absolute alcohol. Tatlock washes first with a strong solution of platinic chloride,
and then with strong alcohol. In all editions of his ' Quantitative Analysis

prior to the 7th English, Freseuius directs the drying of the precipitated
chloroplatiuate at 100° C. In the last edition drying at 130° C. is recom-

mended. Frank and Berrand use 110° C. Until after the conclusion of the
investigations the words "further dried" in Tatlock's method were understood
by the Committee to signify longer drying at 100? C, but it has since been
learnt that drying at a somewhat higher temperature was intended.

    In all cases in which the temperature used for drying the precipitate is
not expressly stated, the Committee employed 100° C. The experiments
instituted to ascertain the influence the temperature used in drying had on
the weight of the precipitate showed a loss of -067 per cent., by subjecting
                                                                                                                                      ON THE ESTIMATION OF POTASH AND PHOSPHORIC ACID.  11

the precipitate thoroughly dried at 100° C. to a temperature of 140° C. for

one hour. This loss represents only -02 for 100 parts of potassium chloride.
   In order to obtain a satisfactory basis of investigation, it was necessary, in

the first place, to obtain perfectly pure potassium salts ; and as a necessary
condition of the requisite purity was complete freedom from sodium com-
pounds, their preparation was found less easy than might be expected *. In

the first place an attempt was made to obtain pure potassium chloride by
repeatedly evaporating pure nitre with hydrochloric acid. The result showed
that the reaction took place with far less facility than was expected, and the
process was abandoned. Chloride of potassium was next obtained by dis-

solving the purest commercial acid potassium carbonate in hydrochloric acid,

filtering, and repeatedly crystallizing the product. Ignition of the crystals
on platinum wire in the Bunsen fiame showed the presence of sodium in
abundance, and two determinations of the real chloride of potassium as

platinum salt gave 98-93 and 98-85 per cent, respectively.

  A highly satisfactory product, was at length obtained by the following

      --_

process : Cream of tartar was dissolved in boiling water, the liquid filtered,
and the acid tartrate of potassium obtained by cooling the solution. The
product was recrystallized, and then tested for sulphates and sodium, neither
of which was found. The dried crystals were ignited, the mass dissolved in
water, the liquid filtered, nearly neutralized with hydrochloric acid, a few
drops of ammonium oxalate added, the solution again filtered, and then eva-
porated to dryness. The resultant chloride of potassium was heated to
fusion and reduced to powder. The product was absolutely free from sul-
phates, completely soluble in water, and the solution was perfectly neutral.
The salt showed no trace of sodium when heated on platinum wire in the

Bunsen flame.
    The hydrochloric acid used in the experiments was prepared by acting on

common salt by non-arsenical sulphuric acid and passing the washed gas into

distilled water f.
    The platinic chloride was obtained by reducing the commercial chloride

(which contained iron and other impurities), by boiling with caustic soda and
alcohol, thoroughly washing (first by decantation and afterwards on the
filter) the resultant platinum black, boiling it for some time with hydro-
chloric acid, and again thoroughly washing with hot water and igniting in a
muffle. The metallic platinum was boiled with nitric acid, rewashed and

reignited, and then weighed and dissolved in aqua regia.
    The platinic-chloiide solution thus obtained was evaporated nearly to

dryness, first with hydrochloric acid and then several times with water, in

order to get rid of the free acid as much as possible* Ultimately the solu-
tion was diluted, filtered from any insoluble residue (which was ignited and

weighed, and the weight deducted from the original), and the filtrate further
diluted until 100 cub. ccntims. contained about 6 grammes of metallic

platinum.

   A* shorter method than those tried would probably have been to ignite pure

--potassium chlorate. A. 31. Allen.
t For some years all the hydrochloric acid used in my laboratory lias been prepared

--by this process. It is more convenient, and furnishes a far superior product to that

obtained by distilling the impure liquid acid. A. It. Alle.v

+ This method of preparing pure chloride of platinum is practically identical with

that recommended by Messrs. Chalmers and Tatlock in a paper read before the Chemical

                                                                                                                                      lie Philosophical Society of Glasgow, April 20th, 1868. The Committee has

--12 REPORT 1877.

As the projected researches required that the weight of potassium salt

used in each experiment should be known with the greatest possible accurac3r
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,

it was considered desirable to avoid direct weighing of the solid salt, by
employing a definite amount of solution of known strength.

For this purpose the capacity of a pipette, which nominally held 10 cub.

ccntims., was accurately ascertained. The pipette was filled to the mark

with distilled water at a temperature of 20° to 21° C. The contents were

then allowed to flow into a small accurately tared beaker. The pipette was

then allowed to drain for exactly thirty seconds, when the last drop of fluid

was expelled by gentle blowing, the nose of the pipette being held in contact

with the beaker so as to avoid any chance of loss. This plan was found to

result in the delivery of a more constant weight of fluid than spontaneous

draining, with or without subsequent contact of the point of the pipette

with the main volume of the liquid. The same pipette was always employed,

and the contents were delivered in the same manner. All the measurements

were made at pretty nearly the same temperature. As a result it was found

that in a series of nearly twenty experiments the extreme variation in the

weight of distilled water delivered was 8 milligrammes, or about -08 per cent,

of the weight, while the great majority of the determinations were within

2 milligrammes of the mean. The result of using the pipette for measuring

out 10 cub. ccntims. of a 10 per cent, solution of chloride of potassium would

be that the maximum deviation from the mean would amount to -04 per cent,
of the Weight, though the maximum difference in two successive measure-

ments might equal twice this proportion.

The experiments showed that at 20° C. the pipettes delivered a mean

weight of 9-9329 grammes of distilled water.

The most convenient quantity of chloride of potassium for precipitation

Awith platinic chloride is about *7 gramme, or 10 grains.  solution of pure

chloride of potassium was therefore prepared of such strength that the

pipette should deliver about that amount.

   The exact amount of chloride of potassium contained in one pipette delivery

of the solution was next ascertained. Two determinations were made by

precipitating a pipette full with nitrate of silver, and one by direct evapora-

tion of the liquid to dryness with subsequent cautious heating of the residue.

                                                                                                     ;

gramme was therefore considered as the true amount of chloride of potassium

in the solution delivered by the pipette.

At a somewhat advanced period of the investigations some irregularities

in the results led to a doubt as to the degree of accuracy attainable by pipette

measurements, and it was decided to commence an entirely new series of

experiments on a different basis. Recognizing the advantage the em-

ployment of solutions has over direct weighing of the solid salt, it was

decided to weigh each quantity of solution employed, merely trusting to

measurement to obtain approximately the same quantity. By proceeding in

this manner all errors due to unequal deliveries of the pipette or accidental

alterations of temperature were entirely eliminated.

For these experiments a fresh solution of chloride of potassium was pre-

pared, by dissolving a known weight of the pure potassium chloride in exactly

ten times ita weight of distilled water*. In the experiments made on the
weighed solution, the required quantity was approximately measured by
running it from a buretto into an accurately tared beaker, and tho exact
quantity taken was then ascertained by weighing. In this manner the
amount of potassium salt employed in each experiment was ascertained with
great accuracy. The error in the amount taken could not be more than
·00005 of a gramme, or about -007 per cent, of the quantity used. With
the new solution the following experiments were made as a check on its

    In this case half a milligramme loss of chloride of potassium, probably due
to decrepitation on heating the residuo, caused a difference of -07 per cent.

    Fresenius, in the last edition of his ' Quantitative Analysis ' (7th English),

adopts the number 98-59 as the atomic weight of the divalent platinum,
which also gives the factor -3056, for calculating the chlorojnatinatc into
chloride of potassium. In former editions Andrews's number 98*94 was
adapted for platinum, which caused a sensible difference in the percentage of
potassium chloride obtained. The factor -30507, resulting from the employ-
ment of Andrews's atomic weight for platinum, is adopted by Drs. Frank and
Berrand in their communication to this Committee.

    The consequence of employing the above factors in calculating the per-

centage of chloride of potassium corresponding to the precipitate of chloro-

platinate obtained is shown in the following statement :

   * It is obvious that the subsequent calculations would hare bsen facilitated by dissolving
a known weight of the pure potassium chloride in exactly nine times its weight of dis-
tilled water instead of ten. This consideration did not present itself till it was too late
to take advantage of it.

   The Committee is informed that the factor -194 is adopted by some chemists
for calculating the chloroplatinate to anhydrous potash, a plan which would
cause the result of 100-52 of chloride of potassium to be obtained instead

of 100-00.

   With the view of testing the relative accuracy of the different modifications
of the platinum process when applied to the estimation of potassium in the

--form of pure chloride, the following experiments were performed :

 WThe letters P and refer to the mode of taking the required quantity of
Wchloride of potassium, P signifying pipette measurement and the weighing of

the solution used. In the former case the percentage of chloride of potassium
was obtained by calculating the chloroplatinate precipitate to potassium

chloride, dividing the result by -6D7 and multiplying by 100. When a

weighed quantity of potassium chloride solution was employed, the following
equation was used for calculating the percentage of chloride of potassium

found (S is the weight of solution used, P that of the precipitate obtained) :

   Results bracketed together in the following tables were obtained from

From these experiments it appears that the employment of the processes

of Fresenius and Frank leads to results sensibly above the truth if a largo

excess of platinum he employed. The fact that in all the experiments the

error is in the same direction, indicates that it is not due to defective mani-

pulation. When only a slight excess of platinum is employed in the above

methods the results are decidedly better, but present greater differences among

themselves, as if some other disturbing cause came into operation. This is

notably the case with Frank's method, the error in only six experiments

varying from "01 per cent, to 1'07.

   The residts by Tatlock's method distinctly indicate a tendency to loss ; but
this is chiefly noticeable in the cases in which the proportion of sodium

chloride was very high (50 per cent.). In fact four experiments with a

mixture similar to that which usually occurs in practice (i. e. V2 per cent.

KC1 and 18 JSTaCl) gave results showing an error in excess of the truth

--varying from -09 to -20 per cent. The thirteen determinations by Tatlock's

method show a maximum error of '40 per cent.

In this experiment the quantity of material employed was measured in

the pipette, and for several reasons this plan was found lese trustworthy

than the weighing of the solution used.

With the view of ascertaining the cause of the loss observed in some cases

by Tatlock's method in presence of a large proportion of sodium chloride, an

experiment was made by treating a mixture of 30 milligrammes of KC1 and

·7 gramme  of pure    T  aCl  with  30  c.  c.  of  the  platinum  solution  (the usual
                    jN

quantity), and estimating the potassium in the usual way.

By employing a small quantity of KC1 it was thought that other errors of

manipulation would be avoided, and that the experiment would be practically

to ascertain the extent to which chloroplatinate of potassium was soluble in

a solution of platinic chloride containing much chloride of sodium (or, in

other words, in a solution of sodium chloroplatinate). The weight of potas-

sium chloroplatinate which should have been yielded by the above quantity

KGof is "0982 gramme, whereas the weight actually obtained was only

·0915 gramme. Hence there was a loss of "0067 gramme. In another

experiment in which only -35 gramme of Nad were used, the quantities of

KG and platinum solution remaining as before, a loss of -0042 gramme of

chloroplatinate was observed. In this last experiment the potassium chloride

corresponding to the chloroplatinate obtained was only 95-7 per cent, of the

quantity added, while in the previous experiment it amounted to only 93'2

per cent. From these residts, and those recorded in the Tables, it appears

that the percentage error is larger the greater the proportion of sodium salts

present, a fact which appears to point to the solubility of the precipitate in

solution of sodium chloroplatinate as the origin of the loss. Thus in the

experiments in which pure chloride of potassium was employed, and in those

in which the amount of sodium chloride was small, the variation from the

truth was exceedingly slight, but the errors became greater with the amount

of sodium chloride present. In experiments 42 to 50 the amounts of chloride

of sodium and platinum solution employed were the same as in the test ex-

periment, in which a deficiency of '0042 gramme of precipitate was observed.

If we assume that this loss is the weight of K.,PtCl dissolved by the use
                                                                                                                                                                           c

of -35 gramme of NaCl and 30 c. c. of platinum solution, then a correction

of -0042 gramme ought to be applied to each of the results of experiments 42

to 50. This correction of -0042 gramme in the weight of the precipitate

corresponds to "37 per cent, of KG. The mean of the nine experiments

above referred to is 99*58 per cent, of KG, which, with the correction -37,

amounts to 99-95 per cent.
         ON THE ESTIMATION OF POTASH AND PHOSPHORIC ACID.  19

   From these considerations it appears almost certain that the deficiency is

due to the solubility of the precipitate in platinum solution containing sodium

chloroplatinate.

    If a loss of about four milligrammes produces an error of -37 by Tatlock's
method, the discrepancy would be much greater by Frank's, in which a
smaller weight of the sample is employed. This fact, and the very strong
alcohol required, renders this process less satisfactory than that of Fresenius.

Why the latter process should give results in excess of the truth, even when

the modified method (II.) was used, seemed difficult to explain. With a

view of ascertaining the cause, three quantities of pure chloride of potassium,
with equal weights of chloride of sodium, were treated by method I. After
weighing, the precipitates were dissolved in hot water, 10 or 12 drops of
platinum solution added, and the process of evaporation, &e. repeated. The
following results were obtained :

         Table VI.

  ment.
20 REPORT 1877,

of colour. At 2u0° decrepitation and incipient decomposition ensued. The
total loss at a temperature not exceeding 140° was only -067 per cent, of the
weight of the precipitate. This, in the experiments by method I., would only

cause a difference of -02 per cent, in the quantify of chloride of potassium

found. Hence it is clear that there is no advantage in drying the preci-
pitate at 130° rather than at 100°. On the other hand the occurrence of
decrepitation shows that the crystals contain cavities filled with water or
platinum choride solution, and therefore that the production of large crystals

should he avoided. It seems possible that the difference in the nature of

the liquid filling the cavities may he the cause of the greater error observed
when a large excess of platinum solution is employed than when little more
than the theoretical amount is used.

    In the foregoing Tables the results obtained by Frank's method were
calculated with the Committee's factor -3056 instead of that employed by

Prank and Berrand themselves (-30507)*. By the use of the latter factor

the results would come out about "17 per cent, lower than the figures given in
the Tables. Some of the results by this process are exceedingly good, but in
other cases they are seriously in excess of the truth (see Experiments 3, -1,
59 and 60).

    One very considerable advantage attaches in practice to Tatlock's method
which is not shared by the others. In consequence of employing an aqueous
liquid at first, any sulphates present can be readily washed out, and therefore
there is no occasion to separate any moderate amount beforehand. The
influence of sulphates is well shown by the following results by Tatlock's
method :

of sodium chloroplatinatc. The error increases with the amount of sodium,

but is never very large, and a correction may be applied if desired.

   3. If Tatlock's method be employed there is no occasion to separate any
sulphates, nitrates, or magnesium ; but if the amount of chloride present is

insufficient for the existence of all the potassium as chloiido of potassium,
the deficiency must be supplied by addition of chloride of sodium or hydro-

chloric acid." The results obtained are in many cases very accurate, but

have a tendency to be somewhat below the truth.
    -1. There is practically no advantage in drying the cbloroplatinatc of po-

tassium at 130° C. rather than at 100° C. The loss at the higher tempera-
ture was found not to exceed -07 per cent, of the weight of the precipitate,

but is probably governed by the conditions of precipitation.
   5. The Committee is of opinion that a preliminary washing of the preci-

pitate of chloroplatinatc of potassium with a solution of platinic chloride is

a valuable modification of the usual process. As the method so modified is
capable of direct application to the commercial salts of potassium, and does
not necessitate the previous removal of sulphates, nitrates, or magnesium,
the Committee considers that it deserves to be generally applied for the

determination of potassium in commercial products containing that metal.

   So far the Committee has not thought it necessary to make any experi-
ments on other methods of determining potassium than that in which it is

converted into chloroplatinatc

               Statement of the Results of Analysis of Potash Salts.

   Your Committee has devoted considerable attention to the difficult question
of the proper mode of stating the results of analyses of potash salts.

   Hitherto the statements of various analysts appear to have been charac-

terized by a lamentable want of system, and in many cases they are greatly

at variance with the generally accepted principles of chemical combination

and double decomposition.
   The Committee has been furnished with copies of analyses of potash salts

in which carbonate of potassium is reported as coexistent with sulphate and
chloride of sodium, and the cases are numerous in which similar anomalous

statements occur.

   These various modes of statement are by no means solely due to eccentric
notions respecting chemical affinity, but appear in many cases to be owing

to the desire to attribute as high or low (as the case may be) a commercial

value to the article analyzed as is compatible with its percentage composi-
tion. Thus a commercial carbonate is chiefly valuable on account of the
potassium carbonate it contains ; aud therefore if the whole of the potassium
be stated as existent in that form, while the valueless sulphate and chloride
arc relegated to the sodium, the apparent value is considerably greater than if
only that portion of the potassium be assumed to exist as carbonate which
is in excess of the quantity necessary to combine with the more powerful

salt radicals.

   The Committee believes it would be practically impossible to lay down
general rules for statement of results which, if followed, would necessarily
and invariably lead to an exact and scientific statement of the mode of
existence of the various metals and salt radicals in a complex commercial

salt of potash ; but it is of opinion that whatever modifications in detail

individual analysts may think proper to adopt, the following general prin-

ciples should be adhered to :
--24 report 1877.

   The plan should bo adopted of combining the strongest metal with the
strongest salt radical, after due allowance for the tendency to form insoluble
or nearly insoluble salts. Thus the soluble calcium should always be stated
as existent as sulphate. The excess of the salt radical should be combined
with potassium on the ground that chloride, nitrate, or carbonate of potassium
is incapable of coexistence with sodium sulphate.

   In the case of artificial or acid sulphates, produced by treating " muriates"
with vitriol, the Committee is of opinion that the free acid is sulphuric acid,
not hydrochloric acid. The reason for this opinion is to be found in the fact
that any free hydrochloric acid would inevitably have been volatilized at the
temperature employed in the production of the sulphate. The same remark
applies to sulphuric acid if actually free, but if in combination with sulphate
of potassium, to form an acid salt, it might resist volatilization. The acid
salt here mentioned as a compound of sulphuric acid and sulphate of potas-
sium would be more correctly described as potassium-hydrogen-sulphatc,

KHSOj but your Committee believes that the practical inconvenience of

stating a certain amount of potassium in this form and the rest as neutral
sulphate would outweigh any advantage to be derived from a scientifically

exact statement*.
    It is evident that the presence of free sulphuric acid or of an acid sulphate

in artificial sulphates can only be due to imperfect admixture of the vitriol
and muriate, otherwise the following well-known reactions would havo taken

place :

                   =KKIISO, + KC1                S0 +IIC1.

                                     +           24

                                                                    2

In the event of the bulk of the muriate consisting of chloride of potassium,

it may be argued that there is a greater probability of that salt remaining

unacted  on  than  that chloride     of  sodium  should                   remain undecomposed                                                                                                                but  it
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

is evident that the circumstances are such as must vary with the conditions of

each case; and your Committee therefore prefers to recommend the adop-

tion of the arbitrary assumption that all potassium exists as sulphate, pro-

vided that there is sufficient of the salt radical present to combine with the

whole of the potassium, after allowing for the free acid and the sulphate of

calcium.

   On the other hand, it may be argued that as sulphates are always converted

into carbonate or caustic alkali, any chloride present in the sample would
ultimately be lost in the worthless form of chloride of potassium, whatever
the metal with which it was originally combined. This argument has con-
siderable force, and to meet it the Committee recommends that all statements
of the results of analyses of artificial sulphates should have appended the
equivalent in chloride of potassium of the chloride found. In artificial sul-

phates there is considerable probability that the chlorino exists chiefly, if
not wholly, as potassium chloride ; but such cannot be assumed to be the
case with other sulphates, and in the statement of the composition of those
the Committee considers the above calculation undesirable from a scientific
point of view, though it is clear that there are other considerations in its

favour.

   The distribution of the salt radicals among the remaining metals (sodium,
magnesium, and iron) appears to the Committee to be a matter of indifference,

   * The same remark applies to other double salts, such as MgSOj-^-K.SO,,, and (lie
curious eouipouinnid SK.SOjXiS'a.SO,, often met with in kelp products. The recognition

of the presence of such compounds in the statement of the results of analysis of com-

mercial s-Jts containing them appears to the Committee to be quite unnecessary.

as the precise arrangement will not affect the value of the sample, nor cause

any alteration in the sum of the constituents, while there appears to be no

reliable evidence of the actual mode of combination.
   In the case of " muriates," aud sulphates having an alkaline reaction, such

as those made from kelp and beetroot, potassium and sodium arc the only two

metals present in larger quantities than traces. In the statement of all
such analyses your Committee is of opinion that the only proper method is

to calculate the potassium as sulphate, chloride, and carbonate in succession,
assuming no sodium to exist as sulphate or chloride unless the amount of

potassium present is insufficient to satisfy the latter or both of those salt

radicals.

   The impossibility of the coexistence of sodium sulphate or chloride with
potassium carbonate is proved by the fact that double decomposition occurs

when solutions of these salts are mixed and concentrated.
   The non-deliquescent character of kelp sulphates and muriates also furnishes

a strong independent proof of absence of potassium carbonate.

   The same principles apply to the statement of the results of the analyses
of commercial carbonates of potassium, and in their case its adoption becomes

still more important.

In the case of saltpetres only that portion of the potassium can be pro-

perly considered to exist as nitrate which is in excess of the quantity

required for calculation as potassium sulphate (after allowing for the sul-

phate present as calcium sulphate) ; whether some of the potassium will also

exist as chloride, or whether there will be some sodium nitrate present, must
                                                                 N0

mittee is of opinion that the presence of both chloride of potassium and

nitrate of sodium in the same sample is improbable.

    In brief, the Committee is of opinion that in calculating the results of
analyses of potash salts, the following method should be adhered to in com-

bining the various metals and salt radicals present in the portion of the

sample soluble in water.
   Basic hydrogen, which is met with only in artificial sulphates, exists as

sulphuric acid, or, more strictly spcakiug, as potassium-hydrogen-sulphate,

KHS04 .                                                                            .
Calcium docs not occur in practice in excess of an equivalent amount ot

sulphate,   so  that  it  should  always  be    calculated  to  CaS0 .
                                                                                4

The remaining constituents of the soluble portion of the sanrple should bo

arranged on the principle of combining the strongest metal with the strongest

salt radicals.

   The order of affinity which the Committee considers most in accordance
with observed facts and theoretical propriety is shown in the following list,

in which tho strongest metals and salt radicals are placed first :

                          Potassium.                        Sulphate.

   Tho Committee is of opinion that in all cases in which one of the con-
stituents of a sample is determined by subtracting the sum of the others

from 100-00, the fact ought to be indicated in the statement of results.
This can readily be done by appending the words " by difference '' or " esti-

mated by difference " to the name of the constituent thus determined. The
adoption of this plan would obviate many of the disadvantages attendant on

the potassium existing in the latter forms is of any real value

                  Estimation of Potash.

Although the process of determining potassium by precipitation with
mchloride of platinum is Ihe method almost universally adopted by chemists of
large experience  tho assay of commercial potash salts, the Committee

thought it desirable to investigate also the volumetric method of Stolba,
which is based on the precipitation of potassium as silicofluoridc and the
titration Ox the precipitate with standard alkali, according to the equation--

                  K SiP         +                                                        4KHO  =  6KF  +  H.SiO,.

   This process is thus described on page 176 of the 7th English edition of

into the beaker previously used, treat with water, add some tincture of litmus,
heat to boiling, and add normal alkali solution till the fluid is justbluo, and
remains so after continued boiling."

   With a view of preparing pure chloride of potassium for these researches,
the Committee abandoned the method employed last year, in favour of a

simpler process suggested in a note appended to the last report.
    Commercial chlorate of potassium was rccrystallized and heated until no

more oxygen was evolved, and the product was dissolved in water, filtered, a
few drops of hydrochloric acid added to the clear solution, and the whole
evaporated to dryness and ignited in a muffle at a low red heat. The product

was powdered and bottled. When heated on clean platinum wire in a

Bunsen flame it gave no trace of yellow colour to the flame.
   Thirty-five grammes of this pure salt were dissolved in 315 grammes of

pure water, in order to make a solution containing exactly one tenth of its

weight of pure chloride of potassium.
    In the following investigation a roughly measured quantity of this solution

was run into a beaker and the exact weight taken. This method was
adopted during the experiments of last year in preference to pipette measure-
ments, which were not considered satisfactory.

   The solution was first analyzed by precipitation by nitrate of silver. The
following tablo shows the quantities taken, and the number of parts of KC1

   In experiment 1 an excess of alkali was employed, and the liquid was
then titrated back with sulphuric acid. It was hoped in this way to ensure
the complete and speedy decomposition of the silicofluoride ; but the end of
the reaction was very dim cult to read, perhaps owing to the formation of
silicate. It was also found to be no advantage to add the acid in sensible
excess and again titrate with alkali. In some cases decinormal alkali was
employed towards the conclusion of the titration, but the end of the reaction
was not sufficiently defined to make the precaution valuable. No. 2 can

scarcely be considered a test experiment, for the precipitated silicofluoride

was dried on the filter and then scraped off.
   The next three experiments were made on about 1-5 gramme (twice the

former quantity) of potassium chloride, the precipitated silicofloridc being
dried on the filter, scraped off, and weighed.

   Theso results do not show any great departure from tho truth, especially
as traces of the precipitate probably adhered to the filter and were thus
lost. The manipulation was very easy, filtration occurring rapidly, and the
precipitate being easily washed, dried, and separated from tbe filter.

    After weighing, the precipitates obtained in the last experiments were
suspended in boiling water and titrated with normal alkali, with the follow-
ing results :

   In the last experiment the titration was slightly overdone. It appears,
therefore, that tho volumetric method gives results sensibly below the truth.
Probably the error was greater in the last three experiments owing to the
precipitates baring been dried, and thus reacting less readily with alkali
than the undried silicofluoride.

   In these, as in all other experiments, the alkali was added very slowly
towards the end of the reaction, and the liquid was well boiled after each

addition.

   Three more experiments by direct titration of the silicofluoride with
alkali gave the following results :

in the volume of the standard alkali employed corresponds in the last three

experiments to about -2.3 per cent, of the chloride of potassium taken, and

In the first six experiments to '5 per cent, of the sample. As the quantity of

potassium chloride worked on cannot be conveniently increased beyond the

weights used in experiments 10, 11, and 12, it is evident that the process

is not susceptible of great accuracy even if no other disturbing influence

existed.

   The fact that the volumetric method gives results below the truth is pro-
bably due to the difficulty of decomposing tho last traces of silicofluoride by
alkali, without introducing an excess of the latter. The trace of free
alkali which suffices to change the tint of the litmus to blue seems incapable

of reacting on the silicofluoride. An attempt was made to overcome this

difficulty by adding a sensible excess of alkali, boiling well, and titrating back
with standard acid ; but the result was not satisfactory, the end of the
reaction being very obscure.

   In practice it would be preferable to sot the standard alkali by its action

on moist silicofluoride prepared from a known quantity of potassium chloride,

rather than to trust to its theoretical neutralizing effect.
   As the drying and weighing of the silicofluoride requires but little more

time than the titration with alkali, and gives better results, the gravimetric
estimation is to be preferred. Although the process is not to be compared in
accuracy to the precipitation and weighing of potassium as potassium

chloroplatinate, it might no doubt be advantageously employed in particular

cases.

   The next experiments were made on a mixture of 75 per cent, of chloride
of potassium with 25 per cent, of chloride of sodium.

   These results show that 96-9 per cent, of the total amount of alkali metal
present was precipitated as silicofluoride. In two other experiments of
equal weights of potassium and sodium chlorides, 222 and 218 parts of Iv( 1
were found for 100 parts taken. The former number represents a precipi-
tation of 96-8 per cent, of the sum of the alkali metals present.

   Two experiments were next made on mixtures of potassium and sodium

chlorides by precipitating the solution with hydrofluosilicic acid as before,
but using a smaller proportion of spirit. One third of the bulk of solution
and wash water consisted of rectified spirit, instead of one half, as in all
previous experiments. The weights of the precipitates corresponded respec-
tively to 109 and 188 parts of potassium chloride for 100 parts taken.

    It is evident from these experiments that the process is quite worthless
for the separation of potassium from sodium, and consequently that the
number of cases in which it can he advantageousl}' employed is greatly

limited. Althoivgh this result was anticipated from the known properties of
sodium silicofluoride, it was thought desirable to establish the fact by direct

experiment.
    Since the above experiments were completed the original paper of Stolba

has been consulted *. The author recommends the suspension of the preci-
pitated silicofluoride in a much larger quantity of water than was employed

by the Committee. This plan would cause the more perfect solution of the
precipitate, and probably yield somewhat higher results ; but the author's
experiments on pure potassium salts gave results sensibly below the truth.
As the value of the process is greatly limited by its uselessness in presence of
sodium compounds, the Committee did not think it necesssary to perform a
fresh series of experiments with more rigid adherence to Stolba's directions.

                        Methods of determining Phosphoric Acid.

   With respect to the general method of procedure in the assay of com-
mercial phosphatic materials, the Committee has not thought it necessary to
make any original experiments, the published and collected evidence on the

subject being sufficient for the purpose.

   As the result of a very careful consideration of the subject, the Committee
make tho following recommendations and suggestions. In most eases theso
are quite free from novelty ; but as the evidence collected by the Committee,
and the results of many commercial analyses, show that the following con-
siderations and precautions are in many cases partly or wholly neglected, the
Committee is of opinion that the general adoption of the following sugges-
tions would tend greatly to diminish the number and extent of the dis-
crepancies common in determinations of phosphoric acid.

                                         Solution of the Manure.

   The Committee is of opinion that for dissolving the soluble phosphate
contained in a manufactured manure, cold water should invariably be em-
ployed. The water should be employed in successive small quantities, and
the treatment and digestion with tho solvent should not be extended over
more than two or three hours. Hot water should be wholly avoided, both
for the original extraction of the soluble matter and for washing the residue.

   The neglect of the above precautions may cause an error in either direc-

tion. The effect of employing hot water for dissolving the soluble phosphate
is shown by the fact that the cold aqueous extract of many superphosphates
yields a precipitate on boiling. On the other hand the di- and tricalcic
phosphates undergo change on boiling with water, with partial solution in
some cases.

    For the solution of the portion of the manure insoluble in water, or for
tho determination of the total phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid is the most
suitable. In manures containing iron the addition of a few drops of nitric
acid is desirable, to ensure the complete peroxidation of any ferrous com-

pound which may be present.

    In manures containing silica the evaporation of the acid solution to
dryness should never be omitted. The neglect of this precaution causes the
precipitation of the silica at a subsequent stage, and is liable to cause a
serious error. Another advantage of the evaporation to dryness is the partial

elimination of any fluorine which may be present.
   In cases in which much organic matter is present, iron and aluminium cannot

be precipitated satisfactorily. In such cases the original sample or the
residue insoluble in water should be ignited with an alkaline oxidizing
mixture before treating it with acid.

    Fresenius, Neubauer, and Luck* havo recommended the employment of

dilute sulphuric acid for the extraction of the total phosphoric acid from a
manure. The advantage claimed for this modification is that the iron and

                                                          * Zeitschrift, x. p. 103.
ON THE ESTIMATION OF POTASH AND PHOSPHORIC ACID.        31

aluminium remain chiefly undissolved. As, however, a small and not very
constant amount of iron undergoes solution, the advantage of this method

is considerably diminished.

Separation of the Iron and Aluminium.

In all cases in which more than traces of iron or aluminium are present,

the Committee is strongly of opinion that they should he separated. In the

first place several of the most satisfactory methods of determining phosphoric

acid are vitiated by the presence of these metals ; and secondly, the manorial
value of the sample is affected by their presence. It is therefore doubly

important that they should not be ignored.

The removal of the aluminium and iron from the solution is readily

effected by neutralizing any excess of acid witli ammonia and adding
ammonium acetate, when iron and aluminium are thrown down as phos-
phates, which may be filtered off and weighed. The operation should be

conducted in a cold or but slightly warm solution. If the liquid be heated,

a calcium phosphate is thrown down.

 --The precipitate can be conveniently analyzed by the following method,

contributed by Mr. 11. Warington : " The precipitated phosphates of iron

and aluminium are washed, ignited, and weighed, rcdissolvcd in strong hy-

drochloric acid, and the iron determined volumetrically. From the iron

the quantity of ferric phosphate in the precipitate is calculated, the phosphate

of aluminium found by difference, and thus the iron, aluminium, and phos-

Aphoric acid in the precipitate are obtained.  little phosphoric acid is liable

to be removed from the precipitate during washing, and basic salts are thus

reckoned in the calculation as of normal composition."

                                        The Oxalic-Acid Method.

   In employing this method it is very desirable to previously separate iron
and aluminium acetate. Besides the advantages already mentioned, this
precaution renders it unnecessary to add an organic acid beforo precipitating
the phosphate with magnesia. The use of an organic acid prevents the

complete separation of the lime (oxalate of calcium being soluble in citrate

of ammonium), and tends to falsify the subsequent precipitation with
" magnesia mixture."

   The presence of ammonium acetate facilitates rather than prevents tho

precipitation of the calcium as oxalate.

   On rendering the filtrate from the oxalate of calcium precipitate alkaline
with ammonia, a small additional precipitation of oxalate of calcium may
occur. If the solution of the manure has been made with acid, and sub-

sequent evaporation of the acid liquid to dryness has been neglected, the

precipitate here formed may contain silica or fluoride of calcium. If the

separation of the iron and aluminium has been omitted, citric acid must be
added before making the solution alkaline with ammonia. Of course it' a
precipitate is formed at this stage, from whatever cause, it must be separated
beforo adding " magnesia mixture.''

                                          Direct Citric-Acid Method.

   In this method the iron, aluminium, and calcium are all retained in solu-
tion by means of citrate of ammonium, and no attempt is made to separate
the calcium as oxalate ; but the phosphate is at once precipitated from the
ammoniacal solution by " magnesia mixture." Although in the hands of
several chemists of high repute this convenient method gives very good re-
 32 report-- 1877'.

 suits, the sources of error are too numerous to be wholly disregarded.
 Titration of the precipitate with uranium appears preferable to direct

 weighing.

                              Precipitation ivith " Magnesia Mixture."

    Repeated experiments having shown that the employment of sulphate of
 magnesium for the precipitation of ammonio-magnesium-phosphate is at-
 tended with considerable tendency to error, the Committee is of opinion that
 it should bo definitely abandoned in favour of the chloride.

    The volume of " magnesia mixture " employed for the precipitation should
 only be in moderate excess of the amount necessary to completely precipitate

 the phosphate present.

    The use of a large excess of the precipitant causes a more rapid separation
of the double phosphate, but is attended with such a serious tendency to
error that any advantage gained is more than counterbalanced. The pre-
 cipitant should be added slowly.

    The precipitation should be conducted in the cold, and solution should
not be too concentrated. The proportion of free ammonia in the liquid
should be large. The minimum amount of ammonia water should be em-

 ployed for washing.
    If the above precautions are duly observed, and silica, fluorine, iron, and

aluminium be previously removed, it will rarely be necessary to purify the
precipitate by solution in acid and reprecipitation with ammonia. In re-
precipitating, some "magnesia mixture" should be added, as its presence
tonds to reduce the solubility of the precipitate in the ammoniacal liquid.

Any correction for solubility of the precipitate should be applied to the

ammoniacal washing, and not to the original filtrate.
    In igniting the precipitate the heat should be very gentle at first and

afterwards be raised as high as possible. If citric acid has been employed,

the ignited precipitate is often discoloured. This may be remedied by

cautious treatment in the crucible with strong nitric acid followed by

reignition.

    If the precipitate of ammonio-magnesium-phosphato be titrated by

standard solution of uranium instead of being weighed, many of the above

precautions are rendered superfluous.

                                          Estimation by Uranium.

   The removal of iron and aluminium by addition of an alkaline acetate in
the cold, with determination of the phosphoric acid in the filtrate by means
of a standard solution of uranium, is a method which, in the opinion of the
Committee, deserves extended employment. The use of an acetate in a

slightly acid solution brings the liquid into just the condition required for

the use of the uranium process. The proportions of acetic acid and alkaline
acetate employed, and the volume of the solution, should bo approximately
constant. The uranium nitrate should bo standardized with an acetic-acid
solution of pure precipitated ammonio-magnesium-phosphate or tricalcic
phosphate, instead of with phosphate of sodium.

   The titration should be converse, the solution of the phosphate being added
to that of the uranium. The latter should be mixed with a constant pro-
portion of acetic acid, and heated on a bath of boiling water. The indicator
should bo powdered potassium ferrocyanide on a white porcelain slab.
Owing to the reversal of the usual process, the brown colour of the ferro-
cyanide of uranium becomes gradually fainter till the end of the titration.

                                            Mohjbdic-Acid Method.

    Konnenschein's process of precipitation with molybdic acid, with subsequent
treatment with magnesia mixture, and weighing as magnesium pyrophosphate,

is probably the most uniformly accurate of all known processes for deter-
mining phosphoric acid. It appears always to be employed when great

accuracy is desired, and some chemists use it habitually. In some respects,
however, the process is not well fitted for general uso, for the following

reasons :

  A very large excess of molybdic acid above that which is actually precipi-

tated as " phospho-molybdate of ammonium " is re .pared for' the complete
separation of the phosphoric acid of the solution. The reagent is somewhat
expensive, and there is no simple process of recovering the molybdenum

from the filtrate.
   The yellow precipitate contains le.33 than four per cent, of anhydrous

phosphoric acid, and thus becomes very balky and unmanageable when the

quantity of phosphoric acid present exceeds -1 or -2 of a gramme. This fact
leads to the employment of very small quantities of the material ; and as the
yellow precipitate has to be subsequently redissolvod and precipitated with
magnesia mixture in the ordinary way, the error liable to occur from the
use of an unusually small weight of the sample detracts greatly from the
value of the method.

   The above considerations, together with the loss of time and expense in-
cident to the use of the process, prevent the Committee from recommending
it for general adoption, though it is of opinion that in many instances the
method may be used with great advantage, and that in some cases it is

invaluable.

    Pisani has described a method of determining molybdic acid by reducing
its acid solution with zinc, and titrating the brown liquid with standard
permanganate.

   J. Macagno has proposed to apply this process to the determination of
phosphoric acid, by first precipitating the latter with " molybdate solution "
and then titrating the molybdic acid in the precipitate in the above manner.

   The Committee has instituted some experiments on this process, but the
results were very unsatisfactory

                                            Reduced Phosphates.

   It is well known that the soluble phosphate of somo superphosphates has

a tendency to pass back into the insoluble condition. It is plausibly argued

that the finely divided insoluble phosphate thus produced is equal in mano-

rial value to the soluble phosphate originating it, and therefore that in
judging of the value of the manure tho insoluble " reduced " phosphate
should be stated separately, and regarded as of equal manurial value to the

actual soluble phosphate.

   The methods which have been employed for the determination of " re-
duced " phosphate are based on the ready solubility of such precipitated
phosphate, in certain liquids, or on its easy decomposition by certain alkaline

salts. For its solution, citrate of ammonium has been employed, and for its
decomposition with formation of a soluble j)hosphate, oxalate of ammonium*

or bicarbonate of sodium f is used.

   A series of very suggestive experiments on Chesshire's bicarbonato-of-

sodium and Gibson's oxalate-of-ammonium methods have been communicated

Using a smaller quantity of the sample in the oxalate method, 47'76 per

   It appears, therefore, that " reduced '' phosphates are indicated by each
process, even in natural phosphatic materials which have never been treated

with acid, and hence the methods of determination are useless*.
   The same objections apply to the citrate-of-ammonium method, especially

with respect to the phosphate of aluminium known as " Bedonda Phosphate."

    It follows, therefore, that the latter comparatively cheap material would
(if introduced into a superphosphate) be mistaken for and quoted as " re-

duced phosphate."

   From the above considerations it appears that the known methods of

determining the reduced phosphates are purely arbitrary.

   It is now generally admitted that the cause of the "going back" to the

condition of insoluble phosphate is the presence of iron or aluminium in the

manure; and many chemists are of opinion that the "reduced" phosphates

actually consist of the phosphates of iron and aluminium produced by some

such reaction as the followin*gB :

         + = + +CaH                                                                                               2H S0 .

At any rate it is a fact that only manures containing iron and aluminium

have a tendency to form reduced phosphates ; so that the manufacturer has

the remedy in his own hands, to avoid using mineral phosphate containing

iron or aluminium.

In the analysis of mineral phosphates the proportion of oxide of iron and

alumina is usually stated, but these constituents rarely appear in the analyses

of " superphosphates " made therefrom.

It is generally held that the phosphates of iron and aluminium have a

very limited manurial value, and this fact is a strong argument against the

reduced phosphates being calculated into and credited as phosphate of

calcium. The value of a manure so largely depends on the proportion of

oxide of iron and alumina present, that the Committee is very strongly of

opinion that the united percentage of these two bases in a manufactured

manure (superphosphate) should always be stated. By doing so the manu-

facturer or purchaser would be enabled to judge of the probability of a newly
made manure " going back " on keeping, and he would be in a better posi-

tion to form an opinion of the true value of the sample. At the same time

the estimation of the " reduced " phosphates would often be rendered super-

fluous.

   The actual mode of occurrence of some of the constituents of manures is
very uncertain, and although interesting in a strictly scientific sense, is of
very limited practical importance. The Committee is of opinion that the
methods of statement now generally adopted are sufficient for commercial
purposes ; but with the view of securing greater uniformity in the statement
of rosults by different chemists the adoption of the following plan is
recommended :

Statement op the Results of Analysis op Commercial Phosphates.

With respect to the mode of statement of the results of analyses of manu-

factured phosphates the Committee holds the following opinions :

"When found in quantities greater than traces, the proportions of oxide of

iron and alumina in the sample should always bo stated, and also their

equivalents  of  the  corresponding          phosphates        (JFe P0 and                                             Al  P0         )  and  the
                                                                                     4                                             4

equivalent of the latter in tricalcic phosphate. Hence that item would

appear somewhat as follows :

             Oxide of iron and alumina                                                                                 A°/

             (Equal to phosphates of iron and aluminium . . B°/ )

             (Equal to neutral phosphate of calcium                                                                    C°/ )

If it be proposed for any reason to state the iron and aluminium as phos-

phates instead of oxides the following form would be suitable :

             Phosphates of iron and aluminium                                                                          B°/

             (Equal to neutral phosphate of calcium                                                                    C°/u )
             (Containing anhydrous phosphoric acid
                                                                                                                       D°/ )

The object of stating the equivalents in phosphate of calcium and phos-

phoric acid is to give the manufacturer or purchaser an estimate of the
tendency of the sample to " go back " owing to tho formation of reduced

phosphates.

The Committee is of opinion that the soluble phosphate in a manure pre-

pared with acid is best stated as acid calcium phosphate, though in some

cases it may be questioned whether it wholly exists in that form. The term

" bi-pbosphate "   should  as  far  as       possible    be  abandoned                                                 but as this       cannot
                                                                                                                    ;

bo done suddenly it is recommended that the equivalent of CaH (P0j,, in
                                                                                                                                                                                                  4

Ca P., O should also be given. It is likewise desirable to state the equivalent
                      e

amount  of   bone  phosphate   (Ca           (P04 ) 2 )  from  which  the                                              soluble  phosphate
                                          3

has been derived. Hence the statement of the soluble phosphate will be

somewhat as follows :

             Soluble acid phosphate of calcium                                                                         E%
             (Equal to so-called bi-phosphate of lime
                                                                                                                       E%)

             (Equal to neutral phosphate of calcium (bone

                phosphate) made soluble                                                                                Gc°/ )

             (Containing anhydrous phosphoric acid                                                                     H%)

   The statement of the insoluble phosphate presents no difficulty.
   The Committee is not prepared to make any recommendation respecting
the statement of the calcium sulphate, but is of opinion that whether the
anhydrous or the hydrated substance is entered as existent in the sample,

tho equivalent of the other should also be added in parenthesis.

   The Committee believes that it has clone all in its power to secure tho
objects for which it was appointed, and therefore presents this as its first

report.

                                                                                                                                1)2

                                      Correlation of Ajipendages.

By the term " correlation " I mean a change of form associated with func-

tional variations, tho character of which is sufficiently distinct to produce,

both in appearance and application, an appendage that is essentially dif-

ferent from the type with which it is homologically connected.

The eyes are less subject to correlate with other forms than most other

appendages. This probably arises from the circumstance that their func-

tional properties are only liable to vary in a greater or less degree of utility.

It is true that Alphonse Milne-Edwards has observed in a species of

Palinurus the eye to become altered into an antenna-like appendage : and

the author of this report contends that it is homologous with the first pair of

appendages in Nauplius, and therefore correlates with a free-swimming appen-

dage (Proceedings Hoy. Soc. vol. xxiv. p. 377) ; but our knowledge of the

cases is small where the eye loses its functional power ; consequently we must

assume that its variation in form must be limited in degree only consistent

with its uses.

In Podopldhalma and allied genera the organ is extended on a very

long appendage, whereas in others the peduncle is extremely short ; and in

those genera that reside in dark habitats the visual organ has become so

depauperized that it can only be traced through the anatomical arrangement

of the nervous system. This is the case with the Cirripedia, where, from

the fixed nature of the animal, sight would only be a means of inflicting

pain, since the animal could not escape any object of terror it observed

approaching.

The eye in the Nauplius form, whether in young specimens of the higher

types or adult forms of Entomostracous Crustacea, is not homologous with

the true orgaii of the higher forms of Crustacea, and therefore cannot be said

to correlate with it.

The first pair of antennae, called the antcnnules by some writers, is

generally of a very simple character. They usually consist in their outward

form of a base or peduncle made up of three separate joints, the remaining

portion being broken up into numerous minute articuli, that gradually

decrease in size towards the extremity, and so become long and flexible, like

the lash of a whip, and consequently are named the flagellum by anatomists.

It is usual for this to break into two separate branches ; and it is clear that
one must be of a superior character to the other, since there are certain

organisms attached to it that are invariably constant, whereas they are never

attached to the other. I have therefore, when desirous to distinguish the

former, identified it as the primary branch of the flagellum and the other as

the secondary, which in different species is again liable to be rcdivided at

various points along the branch, but every time forming more feeble and

less important branches. This appendage, when compared with its homo-

type, a truly formed walking-limb, differs from it in the same way as the

latter changes in the lower forms of Crustacea when variatcd for other pur-

Aposes, as in Mysis.                  true or normally developed limb adapted for walking

consists of seven separate joints. The first pair of antennas consists of seven

also                    but three of  these only retain their normal  character, the  four  others
                     ;

being differentiated so as to comply with other conditions necessitated by

distinct wants.
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  37

   The first, or coxa, is the joint that is most important to the necessities of
the animal; it is the part that invariably contains the functional organ with
which the appendage is endowed, and is most capable of internal organic change.
In the lower types of Crustacea it differs little in external form from the
other less important joints of the same limb, and appears to become depre-
ciated as it corresponds with the increasing length of the ftagellum. In

Aniphipoda the length of this antenna is often very considerable in the deep-
sea genera; whereas in those that live on the shore or on land, as Talitrus
and Orchestia mostly do, not only do the flagclla diminish in general pro-
portion, but the entire organ, as an appendage, becomes enfeebled and weak,
arguing strongly that its higher endowments arc best capable of full develop-
ment under the former than the latter conditions.

   Moving upwards in the grade of animal life, in those Crustacea that pursue
a wholly aquatic existence this first pair of antennae, while decreasing in the
length of the flagellum, does so apparently by diminishing its tenuity, and
so condensing all its power within less extent. This also corresponds with

a similar change in the coxal joint of the peduncle.
    This ehango appears to bo carried to the highest extent in the short-tailed

genera, of which wo may find a convenient example in the common edible
Crab (Cancer pagurus) of the British seas. The coxa in this genus is very
much larger than the other joints of the peduncle, and on being opened is

found to contain an osseous chamber, attached by one extremity only to the

antcro-extcrnal surface of the outer walls of the joint.

   In the genus Maia a similar chamber, but different in form, exists ; and

this probably will be found to be true of all the Brachyura or short-bodied

forms of crabs.
    In the Macrura a chamber of a similar nature, but longer in form, cor-

responds with the depreciated appearance of the coxal joint of the antenna,
which is longer, narrower, and carries a longer and more slender flagellum
than the Brachyura. But the chamber in the Macrura is certainly of a
very peculiar character, for it is in some of the species, such as Homarus,
Astceus, and Paliimrus, more or less completely filled with particles of sand.
This sand is thrown off with the exuviations of the animal at each successive
moult, and is again replaced by the voluntary act of the crustacean itself.

    In some genera, such as Anchistia, Palcemon, and Lucifer, there exist

various forms of otolithes.
    In lower orders, such as the Amphipoda, the antenna is very simple, and

generally long and slender. The second filament, which in the higher
groups is commonly equal in length with the primary branch, is in this
order reduced to a rudimentary condition, and is frequently wanting in the

Weadult form, although almost invariably present in the young stage.

generally find, however, that in those genera where this antenna is reduced
in length the coxa increases in dimensions, while the two succeeding joints

 are less so in proportion.

   A marked exception to this is perceptible in Orchestia and Talitrus and

the terrestrial Isopods, where the appendage is short and unimportant, ap-
 proximating towards a rudimentary condition. In the Hyperidians it has a
I endency to become enfeebled and diminutive. The tendency to variation
 in these two widely separated forms is certainly the result of certain altered
 circumstances which interfere with the characteristic development of the

 organ.

in the water, and some species are found some miles inland. Their short
antennae differ from those of the truly aquatic genera of the Lysianassidce,
and are evidently organs in a rudimentary condition, impoverished in charac-
ter and small, because they have no duties to perform. In the Ilyperidce they
have also assumed an impoverished condition probably from a similar cause,
although the habits of the creature are very distinct. In the Orchesticlce and
Oniseidce the animals live out of what might be pronounced to be their
accustomed element ; whereas in the Ilyperidce they are inhabitants of tho
sea, but exist if not parasitic, certainly encased within Medusae in such a

way as to lose much power of free action. Organs of sense, such as the

anterior antennae are generally considered to be, must lose their power
from want of use, owing, in the one case, to altered conditions, and in the

other to incapacity for action.

    Talitrus and Hyperia arc generally considered by carcinologists to rank

at opposite extremities of the order ; and when generalization is adopted

from too narrow observation, a faulty conclusion is liable to be enunciated,
such as that which identifies a short antenna as typical of an improved
organization on the one hand, or as evidence of a more feeble typo on

the other.

   Among tho Entomostracous forms of Crustacea the first pair of antennae

correlates with various forms, and apparently loses its functional sense. In
Nebalia it varies so little from the normal form, that it must be admitted as
part of the evidence that this genus ranks higher in the natural order of
Crustacea than the Entomostraca. In Limnadia these appendage appear
to have degenerated into a. simple flagcllum, the peduncle or stalk having
become impoverished to the same extent. In Daphnia they appear to be
wanting. In Cypris they are Hagelliform and robust. In Pontia they
are fiagelliform and long, and they are very long in Cychjis. In Caligvlidce
they are reduced in size and feeble in form, and frequently support organs
of adhesion of sucker-like appearance. In the Lerneans and close allies
they are wanting, unless, as is probable, they homologize with the organs
of insertion, in which case correlation is carried to an extreme elcgrce.

    The object or function of this pair of antennae has by all the older carcino-
logists been supposed to fulfil the duties of an olfactory organ. Dr. Farrc,
in the ' Philosophical Transactions' for 1843, was the first who attempted to
reverse this decision. In 1S51 Professor Huxley communicated to the
' Annals of Natural History,' 2nd ser. vol. vii. p. 304, some " Zoological Notes
and Observations made on board H.M.8. ' Rattlesnake ' during the years

1840-51. I. On the Auditory Organs of Crustacea." He says that " The older

authors, Fabricius, Scarpa, Brandt, and Trcviranus, unanimously confer the
title of auditory organs on certain sacs filled with fluid which arc seated in
the basal joint of the second or larger pair of antennae ;" but " by the
majority of the older writers no notice is taken of the sac existing in

many genera in the bases of the first or smaller pair of antenna?. Rosen-

thal *, however, describes this structure very carefully in Astaeus flaviatilis

and Astaeus (Paliiiurus) marinus. He considers it to be an olfactory organ,

while he agrees with previous writers in considering the sac in the outer
 antennae as the auditory organ."

    This view is supported by Professor Milne-Edwards, as I shall show when

 writing about the second pair of antennae.
    This distinguished carcinologist appears to have given no consideration to

                  * "Ueber Gerucbsorgane cl. Insekten," Keifs Arcliiv, Bd. x. (1811).
               ON OUH PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                                                                                                   39

the apparatus attached to the base of the first pair of antenna1 , which, with
the exception of Rosenthal, appears to have been overlooked by most car-
cinological anatomists. Prof. Huxley, in the paper quoted, admits its

presence only in Macrurous Crustacea ; for he says, "It is universally ac-
knowledged that in the Macrura there exists in the basal joint, of both the

first and second pair of antennae a sac containing a liquid, and that in the

Brachyura such a sac exists, at least in the second pair."
   ·· Although," the same author continues, " the structure of the organ

contained in the first pair of antenna? in the Macrura departs somewhat
from the ordinary construction of an acoustic apparatus in the Invertebrata,

yet the argument from structure to function, as enunciated in the paper

referred to (Dr. Farre's), seems almost irresistible. Still, as it has obviously

not produced general conviction, I hope that the following evidence may be

considered as finally conclusive."

   Mr. Huxley then describes and figures a small transparent Crustacean

(taken in the South Pacific) of the genus Palcemon; and states that the "basal

joint of the first pah.' of antenna? is thick, and provided with a partially

detached ciliated spine at the outer part of its base. Between this and the

body of the joint there is a narrow fissure. The fissure leads into a pyriform

cavity contained within a membranous sac, which lies within the substance

of the joint. The anterior extremity of the sac is enveloped in a mass of

pigment-granules                                                                                             on that side of  the sac which is opposite to the fissure, a
                                                                                                          ;

scries of hairs with bulbous bases are attached along a curved line ; these are

in contact with, and appear to support, a large ovoid, strongly refracting

otolithe.

" The antennal nerve passes internal to and below the sac, and gives off

branches which terminate at tho curved line of the bases of the hairs. The

sac is  about  T ->     of                                                                                   an  inch  in length,  the  otolithe about vrL,T in  diameter.  The
                    ro

structure is obviously very similar to the ordinary apparatus in Mollusca &c."'

A similar kind of formation I have observed in a species of Anchistia from

Australia ; and also Dana has figured a similar structure in the same

appendage of an Anchistia. It may be that Huxley's Palcemon may be a

species of Dana's Anchistia.

   The form of the otolithe observed by myself was irregularly ovoid. It is

described in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society ' for the 24th of
November, J 813, p. 5, pi. xxi. fig. 5G, where I observe that it " bears a near

resemblance to that which Van Rencden considers to be an otolithe, and

which was found by him in the inner ramus of the posterior pair of pleopoda

in some species of Stomapoda."
   Huxley likewise has observed and figured the same structure as being

present in the genus Lucifer ; where he says that " wo have an organ pre-

cisely similar to the auditory sacs of the Mollusca, while Palcemon offers a
very interesting transition between this and the ordinary Crustacean form of

acoustic organ as described by Farre."
   M. Souleyet has also noticed the structure in Lucifer, but only gives it a

passing notice, in Froriep's 'Notizen,' 1843, p. 83.

   The second and third joints appear to possess no peculiarity of structure,
but generally diminish in length and breadth, perhaps in a corresponding
ratio to the increased functional development of the first or coxal joint.

  A filaincntal appendage is almost universally attached to the extremity.

In some genera the lash is consolidated to a plate, as in Scyllarus, Ibaccits,
or rigid rod, as in Clydonia &o. ; but, as a rule, throughout the entire list of
--40 KEPORT 1877.

genera in all the Podophthalmous Crustacea, whether Brachyura, Macrura, or
Stomapoda, there are universally present two or more of these filamentary
appendages, often subequally long, only one of which, the primary, appears
to fulfil any important office.

   In Amphipoda there is never more than one secondary appendage, and
that is always of a rudimentary character, and frequently only determinable
iu the very young stage of the animal and obsolete in the adult. In the
Isopoda, with the exception of the Anisopod group, it is always absent.

    The secondary appendage, even in those families where it is most de-

 veloped, appears to fulfil but an unimportant office.

    In this it differs from the principal filament, or tige, as it is named by
Milne-Edwards, which, in addition to the numerous simply-fornicd hairs
with which it is covered, is furnished with a considerable number of mem-
branous cilia, which arc peculiar to this organ in Crustacea, and may be
found in every form of animal iu the class, except where the entire appendage
has become impoverished from the peculiar nature of the animal's habits

or conditions, such as in the Terrestrial Isopods or parasitic families of

Crustacea.

    The forms of these cilia vary a little in separate genera ; but in whatever
 Bhape they are found there is, I think, no doubt but that they arc actively
concerned in communicating vibrations, analogous to the waves of sound, to
the nerve-system in this pair of antennae ; and on this account it is that

I named them, in my lieport on the Sessile-eyed Crustacea to this Asso-

 ciation in 1855, as being auditory cilia.

    In 1853 M. Lcuckart (Troschel's ' Archiv,' i. p. 255) stated that the
 organ attributed to auditory consciousness was not to be found at the base of
 the antenna) in the genus M>/$is as in other Crustacea, but that a chamber

 containing an otolithe, similar to that found in the antennae of Macrura,
 existed in the inner ramus of the caudal plcopoda, which has been confirmed

 by Ivrbyer, Van Beneden, and, I can add, my own observations. Kroyer and

 Van Beneden have traced the branch of a nerve to the chamber, and have

 no doubt but that this organ fulfils the functions of an auditory apparatus.

    This small otolithe, according to Van Bcncden's description, shows an

 extreme regularity in the arrangement of the several layers of which it is
 formed, as if it were a little agate or highly polished siliceous stone.

     It is liable to vary somewhat in form in separate species.
     In 1863 Dr. V. flensen published his researches on the auditory organs
 of Decapod Crustacea (Zeitsehr. f. wissensch. Zool. xiii. Bd. 3 Hit. 1863).
     His observations extended to twenty- eight distinct forms, and he confirmed
 the assertions of Farre and others that the sand found in the auditory chamber
 of the Prawn &c, is but common sand, ho having seen the animal introduco
 it after having ruovdted. But in those Crustacea in which the auditory
 chamber is closed and the otolithes are cast at every moult and again repro-
 duced, these organisms Professor Huniby, after having tested some 200, thinks

 to be fluate of lime.
     Dr. Hensen, however, appears to attribute more of the power of hearing

 to the hairs of certain forms that exist, (1) attached to the otolithes;
 (2) attached to the auditory chamber ; (3) attached to the external surface of
 the animal.

     The first of these he finds to exist chiefly among the Macrurous Decapoda,
 in some cases springing from among the otolithes, in others supporting, as in

 the tail of Mysis, the otolithe in its position.

     The second kind of hair exists in the auditory chamber of the Brachyurous
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF TOE CRUSTACEA.  41

Crustacea, which contains no otolithe, but is a large chamber filled with a
fluid in which these hairs stand in great numbers.

   The third kind exists on the peduncle of the first antenna and on the
second joint of the second antenna, and, in Palccmon, on the uropoda ; in
Mi/sis they exist in the same member ; so that the function of hearing must
be considered as established in this part of the animal. In Palcemon squilla
the auditory hairs are replaced, as the animal increases in age, by those
of the ordinary kind. Dr. Henseu classifies the several forms of auditory

apparatus under separate heads :

  --1. Those which have one otolithe within the auditory chamber as Lucifer,

Sergcstes, Mysis, Hippolytc, and Mastigopus.

   2. Those that have no otolithe and no auditory chamber-- as Thysanopoda
and Pandalus. Dr. Hensen also mentions Al'nna, Erichthus, and Phyllosoma ;
but these being the immature forms of known Crustacea must be excluded

from his list.

 --3. Those that have a chamber with numerous otolithes as Palcemon,

Pasiphae, Crangon, Alphceus, Astacus, Qebia, Pagnrus, Palinurus, Ncphrops,

and Lithodes.

  --4. Those that have a closed auditory chamber but no otolithe as Por-

cellana?, Hippa, Pinnotheres, Myctiris, Ocypoda, Grapsus,Licpea, Sesarma,
Nautilograpsus, Platycard nits, Pilumnus, Chlorodius, Grtashnvs, Trapezia,

Carcinus, and Hyas.

   From the experiments which he made, Dr. Hensen found that the animals
living in water took no notice of sound made in the air, and that they were
only slightly affected by sounds made with a fife or bell in contact with a
membrane connecting the same with the water, the only effect being that the
crab would first jump and then quit the place. He has observed freshly-

caught specimens of Palcvmon ant en narius on the first experiment leap out

of the water when a sound was made against the side of the vessel. He per-

foimed various other experiments on distinct species, among others that of
removing the auditory apparatus from the tail of Mysis, and was disappointed
to find the powers of hearing were not interfered with as much as he had

anticipated.

   In experiments made with musical notes, he was induced to believe that
certain hairs vibrated to certain sounds. Under these conditions, Dr. Hensen
found that a certain hair, which only vibrated under one note, will, under a

different one, shake to the very base so powerfully that it cannot be

distinctly observed, and that as soon as the sound ceases the movement also
ceases. To illustrate the extent to which Dr. Hensen believes this to be
capable of being carried, he has drawn up a scale of musical notes adapted to

the various hairs which he thinks belong to this sense.

   As we descend in the scale of Crustacean forms the antenna; naturally

become simplified ; but as they lose their internal structural character they
increase their external functional arrangement. Thus in Amphipoda the
auditory chamber and otolithes are wanting, but in all the aquatic normal
forms the filaments are long, and richly studded with those membranous

organisms that I have named auditory cilia.
    The second pair of antenna? has a tendency to vary in form to a greater

degree than the first, but the functional variation is as limited.
    In the higher forms, such as the Brachyura, some of the joints of which

they consist are fused together, and not unfrcquently ossified with the
tegumentary tissues of the head or cephalon, in some instances to such an
extent that' their separation cannot be identified. But whether free or fused
42 report--1877.

with other parts, the normal character of this pair of antennae is that of a
peduncle of five joints and a terminal flagcllum, variahle in length, and, with
but few exceptions, consisting of a solitary branch.

   The centre or third joint of the pedunclo in some orders, as the Macrura,
invariably carries a squamose or scale-like plate ; this varies in size and a
little in form, but disappears in the higher and lower orders, and again
reappears in the genus Apseiides among the Isopoda. This squamiform
plate is, I believe, homotypical with the secondary branches of the flagcllum

of the first pair of antenna?, therefore a correlative of the same.
    In the Brachyura the first three joints of the base or peduncle of this

antenna are more or less perfectly fused with the dermal tissues of the
cephalon. In some, as in most of the triangular genera, as Stenorhynchus,
Pisa, &c, the line of separation between the somite and the appendage is
indistinguishable in the adult. This is also more or less the case in several
forms of Brachyura, and makes a ready and safe key to generic distinction.
In all these forms the flagellum is reduced to a feeble condition, and becomes
almost rudimentary in those of terrestrial habits.

    In the Macrura the genus Scyllarus and its near allies have the flagcllum
transformed into a broad plate or scale ; but in Crustacea generally this
appendage is niultiarticulate, robust, and long. In some genera, as in
Palinurus, it is used as a weapon of offence as well as for other requirements.

   In the Amphipoda this antenna is simple and normally well defined, the
five joints of the peduncle and the flagellum being separate and distinct, and
the whole appendage robust and long, the two parts (/. e. the flagellum and
peduncle) being generally subcqual. But in those genera that exhibit a
variation, the higher class has the peduncle the more important, as in the Or-
chestidce, whereas in the male of Cerapus, as compared with the female of the
same and the Hyperidce in general, it is less so. Almost universally the flagcllum
is delicately multiarticulate, varying from a small number of articuli, as in
Corophium, to an innumerable quantity, as in some species of Bath/poreia. In

the genus Clydonid the flagellum consists of a long, rigid, non-articulate spine.

Among the Hyperidce the antenna is considerably impoverished, and in many

genera it is rudimentary, while in Phrosina it appears to be absent.
    In the parasitic Amphipods, such as Cyamus, as compared with the pre-

ceding antenna, the second is well developed and important, but not so much

so as in the organs of the normal Amphipods.
   In the Isopods this appendage is seldom very important, being largest it

the terrestrial forms, as Ligia, Oniscits, &c, and in some aberrant genera,

like Arcturus &c.

   By most carcinologists this pair of antenna? is considered to be tbo scat
of an organ of sense. It has been worked out and displayed by M. Milne-

Edwards, in his ' Histoire Naturelle des Crustacea,' vol. i. p. 124, pi. 12.

figs. 9, 10, both in Homarus and Maia. He argues that the structure
demonstrates the auditory character of this organ, as we have shown in

investigating the evidence relative to the functional properties of the pre-
ceding pair of antennae.

   As Milne-Edwards, in his 'Histoire jSTaturcllc des Crustaccs,' vol. i. p. 124,
1840, suite a Buffon, bases his opinion on the character of the structure of

the organ at the base of the second pair of antennae, it is but just that his

--reasons should be communicated as literally as translation will convenient!)-

admit. He says : " In Maia and other short-tailed Crustacea there is a

very curious operculum. M. Audouin and I have observed that it is con-
nected with a moderately large osseous plate, which separates from it at
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE 01' THE CRUSTACEA.  43

right angles, and is directed upwards towards the organ, and ends in a
point ; near its base this long plate is pierced by a great oval aperture, and

over this opening is stretched a thin elastic membrane, which we call the

internal auditory membrane, and near which the auditory nerve appears

to terminate ; some small bundles of muscles arc attached to the extremity

of the osseous plate, which supports also the opercular disk of the auditory
tuberelo, and which by its form recalls somewhat the stirrup (bone) of the

human ear : moreover on the anterior border of the exterior opening, which

is shut by the dish, there raises also a small plate, which is parallel to the
internal auditory membrane ; and when the anterior muscle of the little
operculum is contracted so as to turn slightly this little apparatus forwards,

the delicate membrane to which wo allude becomes more and more stretched.
After the researches of M. Savart on the transmission of sound, we know
that an aperture closed by a thin and delicate membrane is one of the circum-

stances most favourable for increasing the power of an acoustic organ

It therefore may ho assumed that this kind of tambourine that we have

described as covering the external ear of the Crayfish serves to communicate
to the auditory nerve the sensations that are transmitted to it, and affect
them in the same manner as if the nerve was in direct communication with
the external membrane. The mechanism by means of which the auditive
membrane is alternately extended and relaxed is analogous to that which

is produced in the human car by that osseous chain which traverses the

tympanum, and its effects should be the same. It must serve to augment or
diminish the extent of the undulations on the vibrating membrane, and to

moderate the intensity of the sounds which strike the ear.
    u The existence of the long rigid lash belonging to the second pair of

 antenme, which is in connexion with the auditory organ, appears to be
 another circumstance of a character that must facilitate the perception of
 sound. This opinion has already been enunciated by M. Strauss, and appears

to agree well with the results of M. Savart."
     In most of the Brachyura the entrance to the organ in this pair of antennae

 is covered and protectee! by a movable operculum, and again covered by the
 several appendages of the mouth, a situation of much value in enabling the
 animal to appreciate the character of food it is about to consume, but one
 that canuot be available for an acoustic organ, seeing that sound could not

 reach it unless interfered with to an important degree. I therefore fully
 indorse the opinion, which I think all recent observations demonstrate
 as true, that the second pair of antenna) is the scat of the olfactory nerves,
 while the first contains the auditory apparatus. These antenna; arc frequently

 developed with great power; and in the genera OoropMwn and Podocerus

 they arc frequently used for climbing, and not improbably for clasping

 foe and friend.
     The fourth pair of appendages is represented by the mandibles (the

 protognaihe of M. Milne-Edwards's nomenclature of 1854, 'Annales des
 Sciences Naturelles'). The correlation that this pair of limbs undergoes is

 not very extreme.

    We sec them in the simplest form most probably in N&alia, where they

  differ little from a truncated pair of appendages, the molar or masticating
  surface being represented by a pair of opposing tubercles attached to the first

  joint.

     In the Brachyura the tubercle is increased to a maximum, while the rest
  of the appendage is reduced to a minimum. This exists to a greater or less

  degree throughout the several orders of Malacostraca, varying in shape and
  altering in form, but universally present with the same functional powers.
--4:4 REPORT 1877.

    In Anceus the functional property is evidently lost, for the male animal
ceases in the adult stage to live on substances that require mastication. In
this stage it is doubtful if the animal imbibes nourishment even in the form
of fluids yet the organ retains the general form of a mandible, but is

                                          ;

planted, both in position and arrangement, as if it were an antenna.
    In the female, Anceus (Praniza) retains the general form of structure of

the young animal, 'when it lived a parasite on fish ; the mandibles are therefore
delicate and slender needle-like styles, arranged with the succeeding ap-
pendages so as to act together in consort with power as a proboscis or organ

of penetration.

    In the genus Cyamus the mandibles appear to be reduced to a ininirnuni,
both in physical and functional qualification, and so also in several genera of

the Hyperidce.

    The appendages of the fifth pair, the deutognathe of Milne-Edwards's latest
nomenclature, are those that are called mdchoires by Milne-Edwards in his

' Hist. Nat. des Crust.,' foot-jaws by many authors, maxiUce in my " Eeport

on the British Edriophthalma," and for which Professor Westwood has
suggested " sjagnopoda," as the Greek equivalent for this and the succeeding
pair of appendages which belong to the mouth. Neither this nor the sixth
pair, the tvitognaihe of Milne-Edwards, appears to undergo any change of
form with a relative change of function that can be accepted within the
meaning of the term correlation. They vary little in character from the larva
to the adult Brachyura, and from the Edriophthalma to the Podophthalma.
Their functional power is invariably connected with manducation, in which
they assist in conveying food to the mouth ; and from the delicacy of their
structure compared with other appendages, it is probable that they may have
gustatory capabilities ; but of this as yet we have but small independent or

 structural evidence.

    The seventh pair of appendages is the last that belongs to the cephalon or
 head. They arc generally absent in the larva of the Brachyurous forms that
 pass through the zoea stage, and only appear when the animal is approxi-
 mating the adult condition. From the time that these appendages iii>t
 appear to that of the permanent form of the adult animal there is little
 variation in form, but between their external shape in the various orders

 of Crustacea there is a considerable degree of variation.

     In the Decapoda tho tetartognathe of Milne-Edwards takes an interme-
 diate character between the maxiUce and gnathopoda, and its functional pro-
 perties probably assume the character of the former rather than the latter.

     In the Edriophthalma and some Schizopoda they are modified on the type
 of gnathopoda in the Macrura, and they fulfil the functions of the posterior pair
 as they exist in the Decapoda ; that is, they act as an operculum, and
 efficiently protect the mouth and its more delicate appendages.

     The eighth pair of appendages undergoes a very considerable amount of
 correlation in Crustacean life. In the higher forms they are functionally
 employed as aiding in mastication. Passing through the Macrura they assimi-
 late a pediform character of an imperfect type, while in Squilla and tho

 Amphipods they are developed into a well-formed grasping-organ. Among the

 Isopoda they are formed as true walking appendages, and differ little from the

 succeeding pairs except in being somewhat more robust. Among the Phyl-

 lopoda they assimilate to the larval character, and possibly disappear in some
 of the lower types.

     The correlation is equally great in the ninth pair of appendages, which, as
  a general rule, is formed on the same type as the preceding pair. There arc
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE 01' THE CRUSTACEA.  15

many instances of variation in form, not only between these two pairs, but

between the appendages of the same pair. This variation is generally estimated
as of sufficient importance for generic classification ; but whatever variation

may exist, it is one of degree only, and not inconsistent with the same

functional characters. These are so universally connected with cither seizing
or directing food to the mouth, that I do not think that a better term can
be suggested than gnathopoda for tho eighth and ninth pairs of appendages,
which arc the first two that belong to the pereion.

   The five following pairs of appendages (that is, the true pereiopoda or
perambulatory legs) correlate between organs adapted for walking, grasping,

and swimming. When adapted for walking, we consider them in their

normal condition ; they consist then of seven simple subcylindrical joints,
of which the last is formed into a simple pointed extremity.

   When intended for grasping or holding any object, the anterior distal
angle of either joint of the leg may be produced to a corresponding process

against which the extremity of the ultimate joint impinges, and so forms a
prehensile organ that represents a two-fingered hand.

    The power of producing a chelate process appears to exist in the various

joints of all the five pairs of pereiopoda.

    This, I think, is strongly exemplified in the presence of chelae, more or

less perfect, in the young of many Crustacea, which disappear in the adult

stage. Thus in the freshwater Astacus, while in the embryonic condition
rudimentary chelae are apparent in each pair of appendages, they are found fully

developed only on the three anterior pairs of the adult. Again, wo frequently

see, both in this genus as well as in Cancer, that supplementary chelae are

developed at various parts of these appendages, not only when they are not
wanted, but often when they are absolutely detrimental to the animal's

requirements.

    In some forms we find the chela is prominently developed in the larval or

young stage, while it entirely disappears in the adult. Evidence of this exists
in some genera of the Hyperine Amphipoda, such as Vibilia and Brachysceltts.
In the adult Vibilia the leg is long, slender, and simple, not very unlike
 that of the same appendage in the normal character of Amphipoda; in
 Bracliyscelus it has the basis developed to a large scale, and the remaining
 five joints are reduced to little more than a rudimentary limb. In these very
 dissimilar genera the penultimate pairs of pereiopoda are in the larval condition
 developed into chelate appendages ; in the former genus by a process attached
 to the carpus, in the latter by a similar process attached to the propodos.

     These animals probably resemble Hyperia in their habits, and pass most of
 their lives within the cavity of some Medusa-like creature, where
 prehensile appendages are of little use, and consequently the force of
 chelate production is not stimulated. It is an interesting problem, and pro-
 bably true, that the not very remote ancestor of cither or both these genera
 is to be found in a form not very distant from one like Phronima, where the
 chelate organ is large and well developed in the antepenultimate pair of pereio-
 poda of the adult animal.

     In some genera, as Gclasimtts, the difference in extent of development is
 very great between the right chela and the left, and between those of the
 males and females. When, in the latter case, the part varies from the type,
 the variation generally exists in the male animal, the chela) of the female,
 and less altered appendage in the male, corresponding generally with the
 normal form. In Oelasimus the variation in the male is so great that the

 chief characteristic limb, which may be either of the first pair of pcreio-
--40 REPORT 1877.

poda, loses much of its original functional power. It may hold any
object, hut it cannot reach its mouth with it ; consequently we may

assume, finding it only in the male, that it is used chiefly as a weapon of
offence and defence.

   In the common Lobster (Homarus marinus) we find the same to a certain

extent, but not to such an exaggerated degree ; nor is it confined to the
male, only that the large chela is developed to so great an extent that it

cannot reach the mouth. In this case we have learned, from observation,

that the animal feeds itself with some of the posterior chelate appendages,
while it uses the first pair only for holding the food.

    It is not often that any of the posterior pairs of pereiopoda arc developed
into important chela?, but eveu this is the case in some genera. The most pos-

terior pair in which we arc aware of a largely developed chelate organ exists
in Stenopus among the Macrura, and Phronima an&Phrosina among the Amphi-
poda. In some genera, particularly among the Anomura, the two lust pairs

of pereiopoda are developed into small chelate organs. In Dorype they are
adapted for grasping any piece of wood, shell, or foreign body that the animal

may hold on its back sufficiently important to find protection under. In the

genus llomola the posterior only is so developed, tho penultimate resembling
those anterior to it. In Pagurus and Cenobitus they are developed into very
small chelate organs, and are used for very different purposes.

    One of the most important is to supply the place of a flabellum that is
wanting in the branchial chamber of this family. With this purpose the
animal passes it into the gill-cavity, and there cleanses and wipes the branchial
organs with the brush of hairs that is attached to it, or removes particles of
dirt or objects of detriment by means of the pincers. Moreover, it has the
power of feeding itself with these same organs under peculiar circumstances,
as related by Mr. Darwin in his ' Naturalist's Voyage.'

    lie tells us that some of these animals, as Birgus, live chiefly on the
land, that they frequently live on the cocoanuts which fall from the trees,
and that they first pidl off all the husk or rind from the outside, invariably
selecting the end where the eyelets are. These being exposed, they,
with their heavy claw, tap one repeatedly until they break it in;
then, inserting one of the posterior pairs of pcreiopoda into tho hole, they
draw up the juice of the cocoanut with the brush on the leg, and feed on

--the milk as singular and ivnusual an adaptation of means to an end as is

perhaps to bo found in the history of animal instinct, being one that is highly
suggestive of educational knowledge.

    \\ ncre the pereiopoda are developed for natatory purposes, they are gene-
rally of a more feeble and less perfect type. In the 8chizopoda they have

the character of weakened or impoverished appendages. The secondary parts
increase in importance, while the primary become depreciated. The
branchial organs lose much of their internal character as well as their high
structural features, while the hairs on the appendages and general surface
arc increased both in number and size. In fact tho rigidity of the leg is
lost, and tho flexile nature of a fin is acquired. This would appear as if
atavism, or a retrograde character, were apparent in the development of the

pereiopoda in the Schizopod group.
    In Nebalia and the Thyllopoda the general characteristics of the pereiopoda

partake more of a larval or embryonic form, bearing, as they do, a near re-
semblance in character and general appearance to the oral appendages in the
zoea of Crustacea than to any retrograde or impoverished condition.
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  47

   The pleopoda arc very liable to undergo a considerable amount of cor-

relation.

   In the ISrachyura the anterior arc adapted for introinittcnt organs, and

cany the penis -\vithin their folds.
   In the females of Brachyura and Macrura they arc formed for carrying

and suspending the ova in the water, and for swimming purposes in both

males and females in tho latter order.
   In the Stomapoda, while they arc used for swimming purposes, in some

genera, as Squilla, they support branchial organs also.

   In the Amphipoda they are adapted for swimming only.
    In the Isopoda they are constructed as foliaceous plates, and often enclosed
in a chamber and adapted for respiration, though they arc constantly used as

natatory appendages also as a secondary condition. This generally refers

to the five anterior pairs of appendages.

   The sixth pair universally in Macrura and Isopoda, the fourth, fifth, and
sixth in Amphipoda, are variated into leaping or pushing appendages, by
winch they are enabled to spring forwards or backwards to a very consider-
able extent, as Macrura in the water, and Talitrus and Orchestia on the

land.

    The last pair of appendages is seldom present; in one or two genera
among the Schizopods they exist in a rudimentary state, but in so feeble a
condition that they can only be considered as present in an anatomical sense,

as for all functional purposes they are practically useless.

                                            On Exuviation.

   One of the most curious and interesting phenomena connected with the
dermal skeleton is the power of its being cast or shed as a whole. This
is exhibited in the Crustacea more perfectly than in any other group of

animals.

   The exuviation is not confined to the external or dermal tissue only, but
extends to all that which in the higher groups of animals is known as the
mucous membrane, or internal continuation of the true skin.

    In all Crustacea, from the smaller Entomostracous forms to the large
Podophthalmous animals, every hair and spine upon the external surface, as

well as every cilium and minute organ that may exist on the walls of the

various internal cavities, is detached and shed in continuous connexion with

each other.

   How this could bo accomplished was for a long time a mystery. Accord-

ing to Mr. Couch, Olaus AVormeus, in the early part of the seventeenth cen-
tury, speaks of it as a thing not to be doubted. The first to observe, with
experimental accuracy, the process, was M. Reaumur; as long ago as 1712
and 1718 he published, in the ' Me'moires de 1'Academie des Sciences,' pp. 226

and 263, his " Observations sur la mue des Ecrevisses."
   He kept specimens of Astaeus Jhtviatilis, or river Crayfish, in cases that he

had perforated with holes, and placed in the river stream. He found, in the

latter part of the summer or the commencement of the autumn, that these

Crustacea change tho skin. He observed that for some days previous to the

uommencement of this operation the animal abstains from solid food,
from which circumstance ho was able to anticipate tho period of the opera-
tion, for he was able by the pressure of his finger on the carapace or surface
--48 repout 1877.

of the dorsal somites to observe that the dermal tissue yielded to the touch

and was less resistant than at other times.

    Soon after the animal appears to he restless, and commences to rub its legs

one against the other. It then turns itself over on the back, and agitates the

whole of the body ; then all of a sudden it bursts the membrane that unites

the carapace -with the body, and raises the groat dorsal carapace.

    The animal now rests for a while ; then it recommences by agitating its

legs, and moving every part of the body. The carapace is then gradually

elevated along the base of the legs, and in less than half an hour the animal

is disembarrassed of its old integument. It draws back it head, disengages

both its eyes and antennas, then draws out its legs from the case formed of

the old integument.

    This latter part of the operation appears to be performed with a great deal

of pain, and sometimes in the struggle to liberate the legs from the old skin

one or more are broken off. This is probably induced from some incident

precluding the external case from being ruptured ; for if the old skin does

not split in a longitudinal direction, it is difficult to understand how the logs

can bo withdrawn from the old case. But as soon as the crayfish has over-

come this painful portion of the moulting, it rapidly disembarrasses itself

from the rest of the envelope. It withdraws its head from the carapace,

presses forward, and quickly liberates itself from the posterior part, and soon

frees itself entirely from the old skin.

    The carapace then falls back into its old relative position, and joins itself to

the percion and pleon : thus the old skeleton appears in general form exactly as

it did before it was stripped from the animal ; consequently it bears a perfect

resemblance to that of a crayfish of the same character. The new skin

which succeeds the moulting is soft and membranous ; but in three or four

days, or even in twenty-four hours, it becomes encrusted with calcareous

matter, and becomes as hard as the old integument.

    Milne-Edwards says that all the higher orders of Crustacea change their

skin in nearly tbe same manner. If, he says, we examine a species of Main

some time before it has commenced moulting, we shall find between the tost

and the chorion a membranous mass that resembles the cellular tissue, im-

perfectly condensed at first, but becoming more and more solid and thick

as it approaches the period of moulting.

    " This new membrane is evidently," says Milne-Edwards, " secreted by

Wethe chorion, and moulds itself upon the test that covers it."  find attached

to  it  nearly every hair that should  be  present at  a  later  period                                     but these
                                                                                                         ;

appendages are not enclosed within the hairs that are attached to the ancient

moult, as Reaumur believed he observed them in the crayfish. Generally

they project upon the surface of the new skin, and are folded like the finger

of a glove which is inflcctod within itself.

   Collinson, in the 'Phil. Trans.' 1770, art. 51, published some observations

on Cancer major, probably the common edible crab. The account which

ho gives of the manner in which the animal escapes from the old shell varies

from Reaumur's description of the process in the crayfish.

    Instead of the carapace being raised as a whole and thrown off perfect, it

divides along the lateral sutures that extend from the anterior portion of the

mouth to the posterior margin of the carapace. This, according to Milne-

Edwards, separates the lateral pieces (or epimera) from the dorsal piece, or

somite proper ; but, according to Dana and myself, the line of division sepa-

rates the second antennal and mandibular somites.
             ON OUK ritESENT KNOWLEDGE OP THE CRUSTACEA.                                                          49

Milne-Edwards contends that this splitting of the carapace in the Brachyura

is a necessity demanded by the formation of the animal ; and he says that

in those Brachyura where this suture does not exist he is inclined to believe

that exuviation takes place as described by Reaumur in the crayfish. Ono

argument against this idea is that this suture exists in every one of the Bra-

chyurous forms of Crustacea.

The new tegumentary structure continues in a soft condition, according to

Collinson, for a longer  period than described by Re'aumur in  the  Crayfish                                      and
                                                                                                               ;

the period of moulting for these animals is considered a period of sickness.

They generally during this state hide themselves in sheltered places where

they may be best protected from the animals to which they are most liable to
become a prey. Some hide themselves beneath stones, others burrow into

the mud. At this period some exotic land-crabs are most preferred for their

edible properties ; but the marine forms aro valueless for food.

   In tho ' Annals of Nat. Hist.' vol. vii. p. 29S, 1851, the author of this
Report gave an account of the manner in which he had observed exuviation

take place in the common Shore-Crab ( Oarcinus mcenas).
   The manner in whicli it appears to free itself from the skin depends upon

tho internal growth of the animal.

   From the period of quitting the ovum to that of old age the skin is thrown

off at certain periods. When very young it is accomplished every few days
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

as the animal grows larger, weeks and then months interrene, until the

animal arrives at an adult condition, when it is cast but once a year ; and
when it has become old, and ceases to increase in size, it is probable that the
shell is cast off less frequently, if we are to judge from tho state in which

specimens have been taken on which oysters of two or three years' growth

have been found attached to the animal. In old age the absence of the

internal growth appears to be wanting as a stimulus for the reproduction

of the new skin.

   Tho increased bulk of the growing animal becomes compressed within
limits too small. The old carapace is therefore raised out of its position bv

the mechanical pressure of the internal structure ; and one of the first signs of
the approaching change in the animal's economy is an increased thickness of

the animal.

   As the period of exuviation approaches the crab wanders about in search

of a retired spot, and frequently exhibits a savage disposition, darting at any

thing that approaches it. When it finds a suitable position, it inserts the

point of one or more of its legs into some crack or crevice, and withdraws

itself from tho old skin by raising the carapace, and escaping between it and
the pleon, in the manner described by Re'aumur and Collinson.

The carapace of the new structure is at first in a very wrinkled and

crumpled condition ; but it almost immediately expands to its full size, thus

becoming much larger than its old proportions, and continues without further

increase in dimensions until its next period of exuviation.

The animal has the power for a certain period of retaining its shell at will

until suitable circumstances both as to time and place occur for the casting

of its shell with security. It appears also to be very shy. In several

instances I have seen animals before and after the process has commenced,

having patiently watched for hours at a time without success to seethe actual
process proceed ; upon returning, after a few minutes' absence, I have found

the old skins cast off, and the animal at rest by the side of it. This would

indicate that it is done rapidly, if not with ease.

--50 report 1877.

   Reaumur described exuviation in the Crayfish (Astacus Jluviatllis) as being

one of great labour and difficulty, as "well as being of long duration.

   In all the cases that the Reporter has observed in the common Shore- Grab

(Carcimis mamas), and they have been numerous, the process has been easily
and quietly performed in a short time, when conditions have been favour-
able, and without a struggle. One condition is the capability of securing
the feet in some crevice or notch ; another is retirement. Unless it
has the former, the duration of the period is considerably prolonged ; it
seems to be almost impracticable, since without it there would be no
point of resistance against which the animal can act in its efforts to with-
draw itself from the old structure. Neither of these conditions was pro-
bably present in Reaumur's experiment ; hence the animal had the appear-
 ance of undergoing prolonged labour and struggling.

    One specimen of the Common Crab the Reporter frequently took into his
 hands, and with a pair of scissors cut away the old carapace as it was
 loosened and raised from the surface of the new shell. After the whole of

 the integuments had been removed from the animal, it hung attached to tho
 cyestalks reversed ; here it continued for a considerable time, nor had the

--animal power to free itself from it without assistance a circumstance that

 induced the Reporter to conclude that the anterior portion can only bo re-

 moved by the assistance of the legs, which failed in this instance because the
 carapace being cut away, the legs had no object against which to press. The
 carapace, therefore, is rejected naturally in an inverse direction, and only
 returns to its old position by the elasticity of the membranous ligaments that

  have not been ruptured.
     This has been interestingly exemplified by a scries of Trilobites that have

 been found in the locality of Newton Abbot, many of which were observed

  with the heads reversed lying close to the bodies of the animals. There is
  no doubt, I think, but that all the specimens so found were the exuviations
  of animals then living rather than the representatives of defunct ones.

     When they have thrown off the old skeleton, the Crustaceous animals are
  very liable to become the prey of others, both of their own and other forms.

  Of this they appear to be aware, and are consequently more afraid of an ap-

  proaching object, and through fear are much more active and less easily

   caught than at any other period.
       It is at this time also (that is, immediately after shedding the skin) that

   the female is in a state adapted for the approaches of the male. For some

  days previously the male may bo seen running about and hiding itself under

   stones and in crevices of the rocks, holding the female clasped by one or more

   of its legs, tho carapace of the female being pressed against the sternum of

   the male. In this position they continue until the female throws off

   the old calcareous shell, when the female is reverse in its position relative to
   the male, and connexion between the two immediately ensues, and continues

    for a day or two, perhaps iintil the shell of the female attains its hard calca-

    reous character.

       It would therefore seem to be tolerably certain that the period of the

   exuviation in the male must be at a separate period of the year from that of

     the female.

       Mr. Gosse, in the ' Annals of Natural History,' 2nd series, 1852, vol.
    x. p. 210, gave an account of his observations of a crab (Maia sqmnaih)
    during the period of moulting, in which he appears to confirm all that has
   been previously described as to the manner in which the Brachyura and Ma-

     crura get rid of the old integuments.
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OV THE CRUSTACEA.  51

   As to the lower forma, such as the Edriophthalma, it was long assumed, on
the authority of Professor Bell, who relied on the assertion of the late Mr. J.

Couch, that the animals of this order never shed their skin at all, but con-
tinue adding to and increasing it until they arrive at tho adult stage. Those

who have observed these animals, and seen how the old skin, in a not very

long period of time, is liable to become iucrusted and overgrown with foreign

material, must rejoice to know that, like their higher neighbours, these animals
can at certain periods of their existence eject their old skin, and swim about
in a new one, fresh and clean.

   This fact may easily bo demonstrated by any who may like to retain a few
specimens in a glass tank, when the exuvia) will be seen soon to strew tho

bottom as dead animals, but which, on close examination, will be found to be
the remains of the cast-off skins.

   I have kept these creatures long in small vessels, and watched them closely
for years, and have seen them shed their exuviaj not unfrequently.

   Tho manner of so doing appears to be upon the same plan as that of tho
higher forms, such variation as takes place being consistent only with tho
variated conditions and forms of the animals. The animal, having no cara-
pace, escapes from the old skin by a separation immediately behind the
cephalon, between it and the pereion ; the pereion splits along the lateral

walls just above the coxal plates of the legs. This separation corresponds
with the lateral opening between the carapace and the legs in the higher
orders, where, there being no dorsal arcs to tho somites of the pereion, the
legs appear to separate from the carapace or cephalon rather than from tho
pereion, of which they form an attached portion.

    The little animal clings to a fragment of weed or stone, and resting there
for a time, gradually liberates itself through the opening that I have de-
scribed, first by removing the whole of the body posterior to the cephalon,
then, after resting some short time, withdrawing tho head and its appendages
from the anterior portion.

    In the terrestrial forms, chiefly represented by the Ligia and Oniscus,
a variation in the exuviation appears to depend upon the nature of the
habitat ; thus, living in the air and creeping about among bushes, the worn-
out old epidermal tissue appears generally to be shed in portions, a circum-
stance that I attribute to the animal's surface coming into contact with
rough projectiug bodies, so ripping off portions before the whole is ready
to be cast off. In these creatures the new skin appears to have arrived at
a firmer and more resisting state before being shed than in the aquatic forms.

   When the Crustacea cast their old integument, and appear as renewed

animals, they exhibit afresh and uninjured all the appendages that have been
broken off or wounded.

                                  On Renewal of Appendages,

   It has long been known that these animals, after losing any of their ap-
pendages, have tho power of reproducing them. But the manner in which
this is done has been known only through the results of modern observations.

   The late Mr. H. Goodsir, in the 'Annals of Nat. Hist,' 1844, vol. xiii. p. 67,
writes, " That he has found that a small glandular-like body exists at the
basal extremity of the first phalanx in each of the limbs, which supplies the
germ of the future logs. This body completely fills up the cavity of tho
shell for the extent of about half an inch in length. Tho microscopic struc-

                                                                                                                     F.2
--52 report 1877.

tare of this glandular-liko body is very peculiar, consisting of a great number

of large nucleated cells, which are interspersed throughout a fibro-gelatinous

Amass.  single branch of each of the great vessels, accompanied by a branch

of nerve, runs through a small foramen near the centre of this body, but

there is no vestige of either muscle or tendon, the attachments of which are

at each extremity. In fact this body is perfectly denned, and can

be turned out of the shell without being much injured. When

the limb is thrown off, the blood-vessels and nerve retract, thus
leaving a small cavity in the new-made surface. It is from this cavity that

the germ of the fixture leg springs, and is at first seen as a nucleated cell.

A cicatrix forms over the raw surface caused by the separation, which after-

wards forms a sheath for the young leg."

   When a part receives a hurt beyond repair, or sometimes for a

less cause, such as a passing fright received by the animal or from

the dread of capture by an enemy, a crab or lobster will throw off

the injured limb. This 'appears to be known to them, for it not unfre-
quently forms a plan of attack on one another. I have known the common
Velvet-Crab (Carcinus puber) attack for some purpose the common Shore- Crab

(Carcinus mcenas), and, with a pinch from its nippers, induce the weaker

animal to eject all its legs in rotation, and leave it a helpless mass, at the

mercy of any passing terror. But when a limb receives a less intended

injury, it appears to be removed by a violent muscular contraction, termi-

nating with a blow given by another limb or against some foreign body.
The amputation is the work of a few seconds, except when the exuvia has

been recently cast ; then for the few succeeding days before the external
shell is hardened it has not that easy capability, and the wounded limb

will sometimes remain attached to the animal for half an hour or longer

before it is rejected. (Ann. Nat. Hist. 1851, vol. vii. p. 300, "Notes on

Crustacea.")

The newiy-formed limb is developed within the old shell, and lies folded

within its case until the animal moults, when it appears as part of the newly

perfected animal, the sac-like membrane in which it was folded being cast
with the rest of the exuviae. The new limb is larger or smaller in accord-

ance with the duration of time which elapsed between the period that the

limb was amputated and that at which the skin is shed. The form and con-

dition iu which the limb then is in remain to all appearance stationary

until the next time of moulting, when the whole creature again advances in

size, but the new or small limb more in proportion than the rest of the

animal, until it equals it in relative proportion.

The size of the restored appendage is therefore dependent upon the length

of time which occurs between the accident and the next succeeding moult

that is, the length of time from the commencement of repair to that when

the limb is freed from the saccular membrane.

The legs during development generally lie folded upon themselves ; but the

long flagelliform appendage of the antennae is adapted to a spiral case until

ihe period of the general moidt arrives, when it is withdrawn, and assumes a

straight lino, the old skin retaining its spiral form (" Ilepoit of Committee

appointed to explore the Marine Fauna of the South Coast of Devon : No. 2,"

Brit, Assoc. Eeport, 1867, p. 283, pi. iii. fig. 4).

   It may readily be supposed, after having seen the animal withdraw from

the old shell, that we arrive at a full knowledge of how the act is performed.

It may appear comparatively an easy natural process to withdraw the soft

and yielding body from the hard and rigid case ; and this may be so when
        ON OUK 1'RESENT KNOWLEDGE 01' THE CRUSTACEA.                          53

the appendages are not very much larger at the extremity than they are at

the points of articulation.

   Tho late Mr. Couch, who, at his place of residence, had valuable oppor-
tunities for studying marine animals under various conditions, gave much

attention to this subject.

In the Report of the Royal Polytechnic Society for Cornwall for tho year

1843 is a communication on tho process of exuviation in Crabs and Lobsters,

by J. Couch, Esq., and again, in the Journal of the same Society, is a paper

"Agiving an account of      particular Description of some circumstances

hitherto little known connected with the process of Exuviation in the

common Edible Crab," by Jonathan Couch, Esq., E.L.S. &c. (1852). This

last memoir chiefly refers to the manner in which the animal withdraws the

large claws from the old shell.

    Bell says, in his Introduction to his ' History of the British
Stalk-eyed Crustacea,' p. xxxv, that " It is impossible to imagine

that the crust of the legs, especially of the great claws of the larger

species, could be cast off unless it were susceptible of being longitudi-

nally split ; and Reaumur states that such is actually the case, each of tho

segments being composed of two longitudinal pieces, which, after separating,

to allow of the passage of the soft limb, close again so accurately that it is

Whenvery difficult in the last crust to discover the line of division.        the

animal has disembarrassed itself of the crust, the latter is found absolutely

entire, and has exactly the form which it possessed previous to the opera-

tion."

   In the ' Annals of Nat. Hist.' 2nd ser. vol. x. p. 210, Mr. Gosse, in his ac-
count of the exuviation in Maia squinado, states that the animals withdrew

the legs, first one and then another, until they were quite out, as if
from boots. The joints as they came oirt were a great deal larger than the

cases from which they proceeded. It was evident that in this instance

neither were the shells split to afford a lateral passage for the limbs, nor

were the limbs reduced to tenuity by emaciation.

 --It is this point which the late Mr. Jonathan Couch took up in his last

memoir alluded to. He Avrites : " That in my former studies of this process

I had myself overlooked or misapprehended the mode by which the claw-
legs were withdrawn from the loosened crust, is in the first place to be ascribed

to the fact that my attention was chiefly occupied with what was going on

in the body and its immediate organs, the eyes, antennse, and inward frame
and in the next place to the circumstance that the portions of the legs

which alone answer to Reaumur's description in any degree are by their

situation hidden below the under portion of the carapace, to which they arc

pressed close by the principal joints of the legs themselves, so that they could

not have been attended to without a greater degree of violence than I judged

myself warranted in using with due regard to the other observations I was

desirous of carrying out.

   " It was evident, from an inspection of the proceeding in this specimen,"

--a female (technically a bon crab) of the stage of growth only one degree

short of the full size, " that Mr. Gosse's statement relative to the withdrawal

of the smaller legs is correct, and therefore the language quoted from Re'aumur

will not correctly express what takes place in the Common Crab ; nor, I be-

--lieve, for reasons presently to be assigned, even in the species on which his

observations were made the River Crayfish. The bony covering, where

this remarkable process takes place, is not simply divided by splitting, but by

a far more complicated action, which yet is beautifully expressive of tho

simple means to which creative wisdom has had recourse when a natural

proceeding was to he regulated. But the most remarkable part of the pro-

cess, and that which particularly leads me to present this communication to

the Society, is what I found to take place in the larger or claw-legs.
   " In these the flesh of the two outer sections is much shrunk ; but the por-

tion occupied by the third, or innermost, is, on the contrary, very much dis-

tended. This is especially seen on the inner concave surface of this portion

of the limb, where, if we examine the part under ordinary circumstances, wo

find three lines, which meet at an angle, their diverging extremities being

hounded by a curved border that is directed at its termination towards the

body of the animal. As a preparation for exuviation, in the same manner

and the mouth becomes loosened by absorption, so this curved line on the

claw-leg has become separated along its course, while the other lines (those

which are straight and meet at an angle) are only so much changed from a

firm crust as still to remain connected together by a membrane, and thus

assume the nature and offices of movable joints or hinges. The hitherto firm

structure of this part of the claw-leg being thus turned into a movable cover,
which admits of being lifted at the curved circumference, the swollen por-

tion of the limb is protruded through the opening ; and, by the tension thus

produced below, the wasted extremity is drawn downward, the greatest ac-

commodation of space being thus afforded with the least expenditure of effort

or displacement.

" In the specimen examined I found that a portion of the muscular sub-

stance of the limb had become so much distended as to be thrust out of its

sheath, and partly wrapped round the outside of the loosened crust.

" But while this may be supposed t^o be of great mechanical use in drawing

downward the remaining wasted portion of the limb occupying the more dis-

tant segments, it offers but a slight hindrance to the final passing of the

whole through the final ring or coxa, where the leg is united to the body.

For  this  last  remaining                                                   space is  narrow                                         and  the distention  being chiefly pro-
                                                                                                                                   ;

duced by a liquid diffused through the fleshy fibres, it offers but little positive

Aobstruction to the passage.                                                           dragging action, therefore, accompanied pro-

bably by a muscular contracting power, is all that is required to enable it to

slip through                                                                 at the same time that a portion of                            the  distending fluid, if not
                                                                          ;

the whole, is so much thrust backward as still to occupy the opening, and

thus contribute to bring down each successive part in turn.

" The extremity of the claw-leg, then, being not only smaller naturally, but

more wasted in this process than the rest, finds no hindrance to its escape

and thus the imprisoned limb is set at liberty. It is a fact beyond doubt, as

appears by examination of many specimens, that no splitting process takes

place in the slender or walking legs.

" It is a matter of some interest to ascertain whether and to what extent

this remarkable process takes place in others of the great family of Crusta-

ceous animals ; and I have exercised no small extent of effort in following

the examination in species of both the sections, the long-bodied or lobster

kind, and the short-tailed or crabs." Mr. Couch's results were not attended

with any great success in point of number of species.

" Nothing of this kind appears," he says, " in the Norwich Crab {Mala

sqmnado), C'orj/stes cassivellaunus, the common Crayfish (Palinurus vulgaris),

Weor various species of shrimps.                                                       may therefore conclude that all the limbs

in those instances are withdrawn from their covering in the same manner as
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE Or THE CRUSTACEA.  55

the smaller legs of the edible crab. The Eiver Crayfish (Astacus fluviatilis), tho
particular subject of the French naturalist's researches, as well as the common
lobster, havo such lines marked on the innor segment of their claw-legs as

leavo no doubt in my iniud that an opening takes place in them when tho

process of exuviation prococds, although not such a mechanical splitting as

Reaumur describes ; and it does not take place in any shape in the smaller,

or walking legs.

   " Tho same may bo said of the common Harbour-Crab (Carcinus mcenas),

Xantho fiorida, the Velvet-crab (Carcinus puber and pusiUus), and Atele-
cyclus heteroclon, all of which I have examined."

   It would be interesting to know how in tho male of the genus Gelassimus,
the enormously large distal joints of the prehensile claw can bo drawn
through the small opening of the coxa. I am much inclined to believe that
the splitting of the Avails at the point alluded to by Mr. Couch may bo more

for the purpose of enabling the animal to withdraw the great osseous tendon,

which at this joint must be extremely in the way of the passage of the rest

of the limb during the withdrawal from the old case.
   In a very large number of exuviae that I have examined I have never seen

the splitting process as described by M. Reaumur.
   Whatever may be the period, whether it be during the larva state or that

of the adult animal, the process of development under which the new shell

is produced must be similar.
    M.Milne-Edwards, in the introduction to his 'Histoire des Crustaces,'

p. 55, says that it is evidently secreted by the chorion, and moulds itself
upon the integument that covers it.

    In the ' Annals of Nat. Hist.' 1851, vol. vii. p. 298, are published some ob-
servations on the development of tho shell of crabs, with illustrations. I

state that I found immediately above the heart a mass consisting of nucleated
cells, areolar tissue (and blood-vessels?), extending to the internal surface of
the old shell, from which it is separated by a layer of pigment, which gives

colour to the new formation. Towards the base (that is, immediately above

the heart) the cells are uniformly large and distinct, while the areolar tissue
ramifies throughout tho whole. As advance is made from the base, colls of a
less size mix with them, which increase in number as they diminish in dia-
meter, until they approach the layer of pigment, immediately beneath which
they adapt themselves, by mutual pressure, into a polygonal form. Tho
layer extends over the whole periphery of the crab, immediately beneath the
shell, the thickness of the mass decreases with the distance from the centre,
and tho larger cells become fewer in number, the mass being chiefly made up
of tho smaller cells, which become lime-absorbing organs for the future shell,
which process commences previously to, and is completed after, the removal of

the exuviae.

WnEN the Report of your Committee, presented at Glasgow, was written, it

was believer! that sufficient information would have been collected this year

to enable them to draw up a final Report on the subject of the inquiry with

which you entrusted them.

Your Committee, in the prosecution of their duties, have largely distri-

buted the circular     form of inquiry                                                                                    but they feel, though a large amoimt of
                                                                                                                       ;

valuable information has been obtained through this source, it for the most

part only gives to the general public information as to local areas already in

the hands of the inhabitants of those districts, and that to collect informa-

tion that may be of general value as to the probable depth and quantity

of water available in adjoining areas, requires personal examination and

study of a trained geologist.

As far as the time and opportunities of your Committee go, they have

endeavoured     to     carry  out such  personal                                                                             examination                                                                   and                   the  results,

with those obtained during the coming year, they propose to lay before

you at the next Meeting of the Association, should you thiuk fit to

reappoint their Committee, Avhich they trust will be the case, as much

information is at present promised them, and facilities are more frccl)r

given as the existence of the Committee becomes more widely knoAvn.

   The value of spring and deep-well waters is not merely due to their
greater intrinsic chemical purity and palatability, but to their being pecu-
liarly suited for domestic supply, from their almost invariable clearness,
transparency, and brilliancy, and their uniformity of temperature throughout
the year rendering them cool and refreshing in summer, and preventing
them readily freezing in winter ; and their utilization and conservation

appear to be a matter not only worthy of inquiry into by the Association,
but one of national importance, and to demand imperial legislation.

   The average amount of hardness of the water of the deep wells of the

New Eed Sandstone, tabulated by the Rivers Pollution Commission, being

1 7°-9, and of the springs from the same formation no less than 18°-8, the

relation of hardness of water to the rate of the mortality of the persons

drinking it becomes a matter of great importance.
   The Commissioners give thrco Tables of Statistics that bear directly upon

this point.

   From Table I. it appears that in twenty-six towns inhabited by 1,933,524

persons, supplied with water not exceeding 5° of hardness, the average

death-rate was 29 - l per 1000 per annum.

   From Table II. we learn that in twenty -five towns inhabited by2,041,3S3

persons, drinking water of more than 5°, but not exceeding 10°, the average

death-rate was 28-3 per 1 000.
   In Table III. we find that sixty towns, with an aggregate population of

2,687,846, drinking water of more than 10° of hardness, the average death-
rate was only 24'3.

   Of the towns in Table I. none are supplied from the New Eed or Permian

formations.

In Table II. three are so supplied.

    In Table III. ten are so supplied.

   From which it will be observed that the largest number of towns supplied

with New Red water is found in the Table with the lowest death-rate and

the hardest water.

   The same result is obtained if we compare towns of corresponding popu-

lations and occupations supplied from surface-areas with soft waters, and

those supplied by deep wells in the New Red Sandstone. Thus ^Manchester,

with  351,189  inhabitants, has  an  average  death-rate  of  32-0  per  1000
                                                                                              ;

while Birmingham, with 313,787, has only 24- 4. And, again, Stirling, with

14,279 inhabitants, has an average of 26*1 per 1000; while Tranmere, with

16,143 inhabitants, has only 18-8.

   But it may possibly be objected that the high death-rate of Manchester is

not due to the softness of the water supplied to the inhabitants, but to tho
density of the population, the close proximity to the houses of cesspools and
ashpits, and the want of care experienced by children in the manufacturing

districts ; and, again, that the low death-rate of Tranmere is due to the

constant emigration of adults. And that these averages, being dependent
on so many external causes, not due to tho purity or impurity, hardness or

softness, of the water supply, is borne out by the facts that Greenock and
Plymouth, both supplied with soft water, with an equal number of in-

habitants, have a death-rate respectively of 32-6 and 23-3 per 1000, due to

difference of density of population, Greenock having only one house for every

twenty-eight people. And, again, Liverpool and Birkenhead, both supplied

with moderately hard water ; the former an old and densely populated town,
with a site saturated with what is injurious to health, has a death-rate of 34
per 1000 ; while Birkenhead, a new town on an open site with wide streets,
has a death-rate of only 24 per 1000, though mainly inhabited by a poor

and struggling class of persons.
   But, at the same time, it is worthy of note that the five inland manu-

facturing towns with the lowest death-rate are all supplied with hard water,

and all from the New Red Sandstone.

   And, again, the average death-rate of twelve inland non-manufacturing
towns supplied with soft water was 26-0 per 1000 ; while that of twenty-
similar towns supplied with hard water was only 23-2.

    "When, however, the mortalities of the districts including the principal
English watering-places are compared, there appears to be little variation in
the death-rate, whether the population he supplied with soft, moderately-

hard, or hard water ; so that it may be safely concluded that where sanitary-

conditions prevail with equal uniformity, the rate of mortality is practically

uninfluenced by the degree of hardness of the water drank ; and H.M. Rivers
Pollution Commission are of opinion that " soft and hard waters, if equally

free from deleterious organic substances, are equally wholesome."

   Your Committee has as yet not been able to obtain much information as
to the water supply to bo obtained from the Permian rocks. These beds in
different areas of England present so many distinct types that an analysis of
them may be found useful to those inclined to work up information for your

Sandstone.

   On the southern edge of the Lancashire coalfield these beds are slightly

unconformable to the underlying Coal-measures between Manchester and
Sutton, allowing the reappearance of the "Spirorbis Limestone " at Whiston.

North of the coal-field the unconformity is much more marked ; at Skillaw
Clough, near Bispham, Roach Bridge on the River Darwen, near Plea-

sington Station on the Blackburn Railway, the Permian rests directly on
tho Millstone Grit ; and in the wide spread of Lower Permian Sandstone,
found by your Reporter to underlio the low drift-covered plain of Garstang,
between Preston and Lancaster, the underlying rocks are of Lower Toredale
age, as is also the case in the deep borings of tho Furncss district, on the
opposite side of Morecambe Bay, carried out by the Diamond Boring Company.

    There are a few wells in the Garstang Permian Sandstone, the deepest of
which is at Higher Crookey.

   In Cumberland the same series obtains, but is overlaid by the St.-Bees
Sandstone, so finely developed in the cliffs of that name, and referred by Sir
Roderick Murchison to Permian age, though formerly referred to the Trias.
The Collyhurst Sandstones are described by Prof. Harkness in the Yale of
Eden, under the name of " Penrith Sandstones," as attaining a thickness of
nearly 3000 feet.

   In Durham and the north-cast of England the sequence is widely different.
That at Durham is described by Prof. King as follows :

            G. Crystalline and Concretionary limestone.

             5. Brecciatcd limestone.
              4. Fossiliferous limestone.

            3. Magnesiau limestone.
            2. Marl slate.
           1. Lower Red Sandstone (with Coal-plants).
--60 REPORT 1877.

   The Lower Eed Sandstone lies irregularly and un conformably on the Coal-
measures in hollows eroded in its surface, but contains many species of Coal-
measure plants. Large quantities of water are pumped from these sandstones,
and from the Magnesian Limestone of this. county, for the supply of Sunder-

--land, South Shields, Jarrow, Seaham, and several villages the quantity

pumped from an area of 50 square miles overlying the Coal-measures being,

according to Messrs. Daglish and Forster*, no less than 5,000,000 gallons
per day, which abstraction has not in the least altered or lowered the per-
manent water-level in the rock of this district, which occurs along the coast
at mean-tide level, rising to 180 feet above it inland.

   The following analysis of the Sunderland water is given by the Rivers
Pollution Commission :

   The Commissioners comment on the fact that spring water, Waterham's
Pield, Pontefract, is not only excessively hard, but differs from the Sunder-
land well-water in having a large amount of temporary hardness (24*9) ; but

it is important to notice that the water of Sunderland, unlike that of
Pontefract, is obtained from the Sandstone beneath the Magnesian Lime-
stone, and not from the Dolomite itself.

   These limestones, as stated by the Commissioners, are rarely used as a
source of water-supply ; dolomite being a double carbonate of lime and
magnesia imparts both these substances to the water. 100,000 lbs. of the
Sunderland water contained 5*89 lbs. of lime and 3*96 lbs. of magnesia,
which must be due to the percolation of the water through the porous lime-
stone before it reached the underlying sandstone.

   These limestones of Durham gradually thin away to the south, through

Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and die out near Nottingham. The thin lime-

stones of Lancashire, already described, may be considered their debased and

argillaceous equivalents, the fossils occurring at Astley and Bedford being
the well-known magnesian limestone genera Tragos, Schizodus, BaJcevellia,
and Turbo.

   The less crystalline limestones hold 3-45, 6-0, 13-13, 14-87, and even
17-0 lbs. of water to the cubic foot. The Sandstones vary less, 10 lbs. of
water (a gallon) being the average point of saturation. The more crystallino

limestones absorb very little.

   Of these Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire Limestones, the Commissioners

give the following analysis :

   From Somerset and Devon your Committee has received no returns ; but
they would wish to call attention to the classification of the Triassic rocks of
the South-Devon coast, recently published by Mr. Ussher* of the Geological

Survey, in which he gives the following sequence :

                1. Upper Marls                        1350 feet.
                2. Upper Sandstone                     530 ,,
                3. Conglomerates                        100 ,,
                4. Lower Marls                         600 ,,
                5. Lower Sandstone and Breccias. . .
                                                      1000 ,,

                                                                                  3580

   But he states that this maximum total thickness is probably 1000 feet

greater than the actual vertical distance, but from various causes an estimate

is very difficult.

   In Leicestershire, Mr. Plant reports that for many years water good in
quality and abundant in quantity has been known to exist at the base of the
great gypsum bed which lies in the Upper Keuper Marls. This supply has

been proved wherever the marls have been penetrated in wells from 30 to
80 feet in depth, and in excavations for brick-making &c.

   In one of these excavations near the town of Leicester, on the base of tho
gypsum being reached at a depth of 40 feet and the last layer cut through,
a copious supply of clear water burst through in such abundance as to
require special arrangements to carry it to an adjacent brook. The water
was found to have worn a deep channel in the red marl lying immediately
beneath the gypsum. The stream remains constant in dry and wet weather.

   The marls above and below this gypsum bed are quite dry and free from
water, and the water occurring in it must be derived from the various out-
crops of this bed in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Leicestershire.

    Mr. Plant has been led to conclude that this water, running constantly at
the base of the gypsum bed, must be the source of supply of sulphate of lime
found in the underground waters of the Midland Counties ; and he has always
found it difficult to account for the water obtained in deep wells (pump and
draw wells) in tho Upper Bed Marls of this county whenever the gypsum

bed was penetrated; he is now of opinion that, as far as domestic and
farming requirements are concerned, in the Upper Bed Marl district, this

horizon affords the most abundant and valuable source of supply.

   And though this gypseous bed does not strictly come under the head of an
inquiry into the Permian and New Red Sandstones formations, yet it is

important as affording another and undescribed source of underground water-
supply in the Midland Counties.

   The various sources of supply he tabulates thus in descending order :

                                  1. Great Gypsum bed.
                                     2. Upper Keuper Sandstone.
                                    3. Lower Keuper Sandstone.

                                       4. Bunter Sandstone.
                                      5. Permian Sandstone.

   Mr. Plant states that he trusts to have some further information about

deep borings now in operation in Leicestershire in addition to those he has

already obtained, and which are published in the previous lleports.
   In Staffordshire, Mr. Moltneux reports that he has obtained a large

amount of information ; but as important borings for water are still in

progress, he would prefer waiting until they are completed, so that he may

be able to present the Committee with a connected Eeport on the area he
has taken charge of, which shall include the resources of the Bunters of the
Cannock -Chase district, where the South-Staffordshire Waterworks are
erecting two large pumping stations, and also the results of mining opera-
tions through the so-called Permian beds south of "Walsall and elsewhere.

                                          Mineral Waters of St. Clement's, Oxford.

   It has lately been suggested by Prof. Prestwich that some of the saline

springs occurring in the Oolites may derive their supply from deep-seated
underlying New Red rocks.

   In a paper read before the Ashmolean Society ho describes the character

of tbe water now issuing from an artesian bore-hole carried 420 feet

through the Oxford Clay and Oolitic strata in 1832. An analysis by

Mr. Donkin proves tbis water to contain 1277 grains per gallon, a
quantity not exceeded by many of the continental saline waters. In tbe

large proportion of sulphates, this water more nearly resembles some of the

German mineral waters, such as Friederickshall and Eehme, than those of

England                                   for that of Cheltenham  only contains  G94  grains of saline ingre-
                                       ;

dients, of which 104 grains per gallon consist of sulphate of soda, which, at

St. Clement's, amounts to 357 grains.

   As stated in your Committee's second Report, not less than 10,000 square

miles of area are occupied in England and Wales by the New Red Sandstone

and Permian formations, which absorb not less than 10 inches of rainfall
annually, and probably more in districts where the overlying drift is porous,
or absent altogether, and the sandstone is of an exceedingly open and per-
meable character and is traversed by joints and fissures.

   This area is a fertile source of shallow wells, and both the sandstone and
the overlying drift sand and gravel form an excellent water-bearing stratum
but unfortunately these shallow wells, though yielding clear and palatable
water, from the numerous and potent sources of pollution surrounding them,
are almost all valueless as a source of domestic supply, being charged with
organic matter derived from animal refuse matters, the total"solid impurity
amounting to 240 parts per 100,000, or 168 grains per gallon, in the water

Park-Street well
--64 report 1877.

of one of the shallow wells of Birmingham. An examination of the analyses

of eighty-seven samples of these waters made by the Rivera Pollution Com-

mission shows, in the high figures of the column of previous sewerage or

animal contamination, how largely sewers and cesspools contribute to the

contents of these wells.

    The preceding Table of the composition of waters from shallow wells in

the New Red Sandstone is compiled from the sixth Ecport of the Rivers

Pollution Commission.

   The pollution of these wells is easily understood when it is remembered
that in most of the villages and in many of the smaller towns the water-
supply is obtained, and the sewerage disposed, by digging two holes in the

cottage garden, often within a few feet of each other, into the shallower of
which the refuse of the cottage is discharged, and out of the deeper of which
the water-supply is pumped from a porous soil, which soon gets replenished
from the soakage of the soil lying beneath and around the shallower cesspool.

The dangerous and disgusting liquids making their way into the well, after

passing through a foot of porous soil, are sufficiently deodorized as to not
impair the palatability of the water ; and such polluted waters are drank for
years, until an outbreak of epidemic disease calls attention to them.

   At least 12 millions of the British population obtain their water-supply
from shallow wells of this class.

    In regard to village water-supply, the evidenco of Mr. James Caird, C.B.,
one of the Inclosure Commissioners, examined by the Chairman of the Select
Committee of the House of Lords on Improvement of Land (Minutes of

Evidence, 2nd May aud 24th June, 1873, pp. 42 and 348), is of importance,

as he states that both he and bis colleagues, Messrs. Darby and Ridley, consider
" that in the case of charges for the supply of water to a village for sanitary
purposes it would be very advantageous, where the village belongs to an
estate, that it should be included in the objects of the loan, the improvement

being one that is for the convenience of the agricultural labourers resident
on the estate ; " and Mr. Ridley further suggests " that in any Sanitary Act

that may be passed, a provision of that kind should be inserted, making the

providing of water an improvement under the Act of 1864."
   It was suggested in 1865 to the Rivers Pollution Commissioners by the

late Sir George Grey, then Secretary of State, that they should endeavour, if
possible, to carry out the suggestions of Mr. Charles Ncate, M.P., that they

should inquire " how far the general level of springs in the country has been
lowered " by agricultural drainage ; " how far it depends upon the height at
which water is maintained in the neighbouring river, and what is the
number of springs that have altogether failed, or at least that fail during the

summer." This inquiry they do not appear to have been able to carry out,
possibly from a belief that springs that would be affected by local drainage
would be subject to surface-pollution, and consequently be of no value as a

source of water-supply. But when it is remembered that many deep-seated

springs derive their supply from distant outcrops, often of an exceedingly

porous and permeable character, the question of cutting off the available
rainfall by means of intercepting drains becomes one of great importance
and your Committee intend inserting a clause in their forms of inquiry in
the hope of elicitating information on this point.

   Through increase of population and manufacturing requirements, the
quantity of water annually consumed in England is steadily increasing,
while the number of available sources of supply being necessarily limited,

the competition for the possession of suitable water-bearing areas, especially
       ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.  65

those adjoining the more densely crowded centres, becomes keener and keener,
and the parliamentary and other preliminary expenses larger and larger.
Rival townships after severe competition obtain the whole of the water
rights of a district to the exclusion of those who, from apathy, ignorance, or
want of funds, neglected to claim a portion of the supply naturally belong-
ing to them.

    The Local Government Board and Parliamentary inquiries at the best
only endeavour to ascertain whether any water-scheme laid before them is
likely to fulfil the particular objects proposed ; and they have no means of
judging whether it is the best scheme, or whether it will interfere with the
interests of other districts who may not be represented. To take two cases

in point :

    Tho urban sanitary district of Pemberton, near Wigan, with 10,374
inhabitants, situated on the Coal-measures, has suffered much from an in-
adequate supply of water. After much opposition in Parliament, an Act has
been obtained to construct reservoirs to impound waters flowing off cultivated
land, and consequently belonging to that class considered suspicious by the

Rivers Pollution Commission.
    In the adjoining urban sanitary district of Ashton-in-Makerficld, with a

population of 7463, situated on the Pebble Beds of the New Red Sandstone,

which at present gives a very inefficient supply of water from shallow and

dangerous wells, an Act of Parliament has been obtained, after much cost,

opposition, and litigation, to construct works to obtain surface-water from
adjoining cultivated land on the Coal-measures, which will, moreover, neces-
sitate constant pumping.

   Colliery-shafts sunk in the New Red Sandstone and Permian formations

south of this district yield an almost inexhaustible supply of pure water ; and
your Committee cannot but feel it a matter of regret that this source of
supply should be so systematically disregarded, which could not be the case
were the Local Government Board empowered to see that districts choose
the purest water and cheapest scheme available in a given area.

   The supply of New Red water just referred to, east of Ashton and
Golborne &c, may possibly be made available for the additional supply of

Liverpool, the water-pipes of which borough pass through the district in
question from Rivington.

    Your Committee are of opinion that it is desirable that they should con-

tinue to inquire into areas where New Red and Permian water may be

obtained by means of deep wells.
    That, looking to the national importance of utilizing the underground

waters of England, it is desirable that the sphere of their inquiry should be
extended so as to include the Oolites, which the results obtained by the Rivers
Pollution Committee prove contain an almost inexhaustible supply of pure

water, which is not made available for the supply of the population living
upon it until it is hopelessly contaminated with sewerage.

    That the result of their labours since the formation of the Commission
has been to prove that there is an available daily supply of water from the

New Red Sandstone and Permian of England of not less than 3600 million

gallons of water, the quality of which is remarkably free from organic im-
purity, and the hardness of which does not in tbe least appear to affect the
health of the population at present taking their supply from it, the death-
rate of this area comparing well with the best soft-water district.

On the South-Lancashire Wells. By T. Mellard Beade, C.E., F.G.S.

As a member of the Committee I have devoted considerable time to obtain-

ing information on the subject we are engaged in investigating, especially as

regards South Lancashire ; I have exhausted the information available to me
through the means of your printed forms of inquiry. Much more ought to

be obtainable ; but companies undertaking the supply of districts are, perhaps

naturally, jealous of giving answers which they imagine may boused to their

detriment at some future time.

Having collected all the answers to the queries of the Committee, I next

attempted to analyze them, with a view of ascertaining whether I could help

the Committee further by a digest of the, to some extent, crude facts and

statements relative to the district I am more immediately acquainted with.

   In doing this I was met by the difficulty of reducing the replies to one
common datum for comparison. With existing wells there are only a few in

which the quantity pumped, the variations in the supply, and correct analyses

of the water from time to time are taken and recorded with the scientific

exactness which would enable me to draw deductions having the force of

demonstration.

   So far as I am able I purpose now to present for your consideration the
facts and my deductions therefrom, arranged with the object of enabling you

to test for yourselves their relative importance.

The area of the country over which my information extends (and here I

must acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. G. H. Morton, F.G.S., who has

mykindly placed at  disposal all the valuable facts in his possession relating to

Liverpool and Cheshire wells) includes in Lancashire the Triassic rocks lying

between the south and south-western borders of the Lancashire coalfield,

and the shores of the Mersey and of the Irish Sea as far north as South port.

In Cheshire the area occupied by the wells of which I have any reliable in-

formation lies within a radius of 5 miles from Liverpool.

For the purposes of comparison, however, although there are outlying wells

which I shall have to refer to, there are three nuclei or centres about which

the most important systems of wells are grouped, viz. Liverpool, Birkenhead,

and Widnes. These " systems " I have shown on (wo sheets of vertical sec-

tions annexed to this report (Plate II.), reduced with as much accuracy as was
available to a common datum, on which I have shown the extreme variation of

level of water in each well produced by pumping. As regards seasonal varia-

tion it will have to be treated separately.

I have also shown on the 6-inch Ordnance Surveys, coloured geologically,

the position of each well in the Liverpool and Widnes Systems, and in other

cases have shown the position of the wells in the 1-inch scale Geological

--Survey sheets.
   Widnes Wells. With the exception of the town supply, these wells have

been sunk for manufacturing purposes. As a great chemical manufacturing

town, Widnes has been entirely created within the last 30 years *, and a

large supply of water is a necessity.

Widnes occupies what I have shown to be the site of the old course of the

river Mersey t> a rock valley having a depth of 141 feet below Ordnance

datum, now filled up with glacial-marine drift*. It is through this drift, of

varying thickness according to the position of the well, that the well-sinkers
and borers had to penetrate to get to the water-bearing rock below. This

portion has of course in each case been tubed. The succession of those strata
is shown on the sections, and consists first of Marsh Clay or Silt (Postglacial),
Quicksand (Glacial), and a great depth of a tenacious, unctuous, fine clay of
a brown colour, evidently recomposod to a considerable extent from the
Triassic Marls, but being itself of glacial marine origin, as shown by the
shell-fragments and occasional erratic boulders and pebbles it contains. This
reposes on a red sand often containing erratic pebbles, the top sand of the

red rock below. According to the Geological Survey the bed-rock belongs to

the Pebble Beds, or middle division of the Bunter.

   It is pretty certain from the consensus of evidence on the subject that when
this retentive bed of brown marl was first pierced the water rose above the sur-

Aface of tho ground. reference to the section will show that the water-level has

been permanently lowered by pumping to an average of about 8 feet below the
surface ; when the pumps are at work, of course the level of the water in the
well is entirely dependent upon tho power of the pumps. I have not been,
able to obtain returns from all the well-owners, but the amount of water of
which I have returns, if we include the Local-Board well at Crouton, is
1,670,000 gallons per diem ; I should think, however, there must be a mil-
lion more gallons pumped*. The form of the printed questions, however,
creates a difficulty, as the " Quantity capable of being pumped up in gallons
per day " is not necessarily the same thing as the actual yield.

    There can be no doubt, however, that a very considerable quantity of water
in this area is tapped and utilized. It will be seen from the sections that

    Stocks Well, Cronton. This is a well belonging to the Widnes Local
Board. It is situated about 2 5 miles from Widnes, and is 70 feet above O.D.
(not 45 as stated in the return) ; but as it does not lie in the Preglacial
valley of the Mersey, I mention it separately. It yields 800,000 gallons per
day. Before pumping the water flows over at the surface, and therefore
rises 52 feet above the water-level at Widnes. The Widnes Board are sink-

ing a well at Netherley Bridge, and, I understand, get a yield now of about

--350,000 gallons per day.
    Garston Iron Works. The yield of this well is 240,000 gallons per day.
It is situated on the margin of the river Mersey, and the water-level appears
to be approximately the same as at Widnes. As it is nearly 7 miles from
Widnes and 4 from Liverpool the water-level appears to be governed by
proximity to the river. The water-level is stated to have diminished.

    At Whiston the St.-Helen's Corporation have established a well; but

further than that the yield is 1,000,000 gallons per day I have no reliable

information.

  --Ince Waterworks, Qolbourne. In a direct line this well is over 10

miles from Widnes. The surface-level is 125 feet above O.D. ; the yield
240,000 gallons per diem. The water-level before pumping is stated to be
 80 feet below the surface, or 45 feet above O.D.

of this well is its being all in the drift, finishing in a bed of gravel about 100
feet below the surface. The water, rising to within 3 feet 6 inches of the

 my returns.

--perceptibly affected by the seasons.
    Ormslcirh Local Board Well. This is a well lying out of the special area
I have marked out for further investigation. It is remarkable as being
affected by local rains within 24 hours. The water-level is stated to vary
slightly in summer and winter, but has not diminished during the last 10
years. The water is pronounced to be remarkably good and soft. There is

--a very large fault on the west side of the well.
   Borings through the New'Bed Marls. In two cases I know of, these marls

have been pierced ; the one at Alsager within 300 yards of the railway-sta-
tion, in which 553 feet of the marls were pierced, and water tapped which
rises in an iron tube 10 or 12 feet above the surface. The level of the
surface is 310 feet above O.D. The water is very pure and soft, and suitable
for brewing-purposes. Though the bore was continued to a depth of 1000
feet, the water was not increased thereby. The second case is at Preston
Brook, at which the water was tapped after piercing 400 feet of marls.

   An attempt was made to pierce the marls at the Palace Hotel, Birkdale,

near Southport, but was given up at a depth of 558 feet.

   I have now recapitulated the leading features of the wells outside of Liver-
pool and Birkenhead of which I have information. As the answers are

already printed in extenso in the two Reports of the Committee, any one

--wishing for more detailed information can there obtain it.
   Inferences. Though the information is any thing but of a scientifically

exact character, it appears to me that some useful inferences can be drawn

--from it. They are these :
   As to the present Water-level. It is quite clear that, when a well or a

system of wells is established in a district, the permanent water-level is
lowered to the extent of the draw upon the supply. Though I call this
the permanent water-level, I merely do so to distinguish it from the tem-
porary level of water in the well produced by, say, 12 hours' pumping. It
is not naturally, but becomes artificially, the permanent water-level of the
country ; and in any case, were the pumping-operations to cease entirely, I

--should expect to see the natural water-level restored in 12 months.
   As to the effect of load Bains. In only a few instances have the observers
stated that they could distinguish the effect of rain on the wells. Even in

the one in the drift at Sankey Bridges my informants say they can distinguish

no seasonal changes. It is quite possible, however, that this bottom- drift gravel

may be supplied from springs in the rock below. The Ormskirk well is a com-

paratively shallow one, and the local rains affect it, I should say, by immediate
local percolation. It will be seen that the Liverpool wells are not altogether
exempt from this local percolation ; at all events the Bootle well is not. This,

however, is only in accordance with what we would expect inferentially from

a consideration of hydraulic principles ; the larger the area from which the
supply of water is drawn, the less likely is the well to be affected by local
rains. The nature of the top rock, the dip of the beds, the number and
position of the fissures in the rock, the proximity of a fault, will all assist to
determine the extent of local percolation. If, however, the well and the bore
is made watertight by tubbing and tubing to a considerable depth, local

rains cannot influence the yield to any perceptible extent. When a great

thickness of clay or marl is penetrated I know of no recorded instance of

seasonal variation in the supply from the Triassic rocks.
ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                69

--AAs to the Mode of Circulation of Underground Waters.  few minutes'

consideration will show that the supply to a well or bore cannot arise through

general percolation through the pores of the walls or internal surfaces of the

well or bore. According to Mr. Isaac Roberts's experiments, quoted in your

1st Report of 1875, a pressure of 10 lbs. to the square inch, which I suspect,

exceeds any hydraulic pressure actiug on the pores of the rocks in any of

the wells of which I have returns, gives 4| gallons of water per hour per
square foot of sandstone 10 inches tbick, or 108 gallons per foot per diem.

If wo take the total area of the surface of the three wells and bore-holes of

Messrs. Gaskell, Deacon, and Co., at Widnes, which is the largest well-sur-

face, compared with the yield of water, that I have recorded, it amounts to

4428 superficial feet, which, with 500,000 gallons per diem, gives 113 gallons

per superficial foot per diem, assuming the water to ooze out at the same rate

from top to bottom, which is manifestly absurd ; if, on the contrary, we take the

Green Lane one recorded in your Report of 1875, p. 123, we find it has an

area of only 95 superficial feet of surface and a yield of 817,000 gallons per

diem, or 8600 gallons per foot per diem.

   It is tbus evident to me that the rain-water is absorbed generally by the rock

at the surface, and that it percolates very gradually to underground fissures,

traverses planes of bedding and jointing, and so circulates and is drawn off at

the well. It is, in fact, a large rock-filter, with veins and ramifications ex-

tending in various directions, which enable us to tap and draw off the supply;

and it is this freer circulation than what would take place through homoge-

neous rock that enables us to draw in some cases those immense supplies,

such as is obtained at Green Lane, of 3,243,549 gallons per diem as a maxi-

mum, the average quantity for 1876 being 2,903,712 gallons per diem.

 --Source of the Supply : Rainfall. The enormous aggregate yield of wells

in a given area of the New Red has set many speculating as to the source of

the underground water, some being unwilling to admit rainfall as a sufficient

source of supply for the wells ; consequently ingenious theories have been

devised to account for it. Mr. Joseph Boult, to whom I am indebted for

much information, does not believe the supply is from surface-percolation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and Mr. Robert Bostock, an excellent practical geologist, of Birkenhead,

believes that sea-water is decomposed by filtration through the rock, and

that the water of the sea is the main source of the supply. Unfortunately,

when tested, none of these theories will themselves " hold water ; " and

mywhatever difficulties there may be in " surface-percolation," there are, in

opinion, tenfold greater difficulties in any other theories. Again, many

Cassandra-like water-prophets cry out that because the water-level is reduced

in Liverpool, therefore we are drawing on capital, and are gradually exhaust-

Aing Nature's storehouse, or rather " store-cistern." little calculation would

show this latter fear to be groundless.

   According to information supplied me by Mr. G. J. Symons, which I append,
the maximum rainfall taken by Mr. Briggs at Sandfield Park, near Liver-

pool, for 10 years ending 1874, was 34-90, and the minimum 22-64, the

average for the 10 years being 30-14. Roughly, 25 inches of rain over a

square mile of surface gives a supply of 1,000,000 gallons per diem ; there-

fore if we assume that 10 inches are absorbed independently of evaporation

(and I think this is not an unreasonable assumption in a fiat absorbent dis-

trict like Lancashire), it would take a contributing area of 7-5 square miles

to supply 3 million gallons per diem. It must also not be lost sight of that

instance, where the rainfall is much greater from the district being hilly*

meander through the low-lying Triassic country and supply their quota.

Many of these rivers have loose sandy beds, favourable for percolation ; and,

with fissures, however contracted, to convey the water to a distance, a con-

stant circulation must necessarily be kept up. If we assume the absorption
to be as much as 10 inches, a circle having a radius of just over 1| mile

from the well would be sufficient to keep up the supply to 3 million gallons

per diem. I am not by any means suggesting that nature acts in this uni-
form sort of way ; on the contrary the water may travel by faults and fissures

a long distance in one direction and a short one in another t; but of this I am

assured, that a good well depends upon these underground ramifications, and
that their existence or absence constitutes the main distinction between a
well being a good yielder or a bad one, more than on the actual constitution

of the rock itself, as, according to my experience, all the New Red Sandstone

is sufficiently porous, looked at as a filter. As regards a greater yield being
obtained by boring or not will be dependent upon the source of the deeper
yield and the depths to which the well is pumped down. At Alsagcr no
additional water was obtained by boring deeply into the rock.

   If the tube was well supplied by the rock first penetrated, and the fissures
(if any) intersected by the bore lower down had the same " head " or source,
the supply would not be greater; but if the water were to be pumped down
below its natural level instead of flowing out of an artesian tube, it is quite
possible the deep bore might begin to yield.

   As exhibiting the nature of the underground circulation I have made a
calculation from materials supplied me by the borough engineer of Liverpool,
Mr. Deacon.

    The Dudlow-Lane well is about 2 miles in a direct line from the Green-
Lane well, and while the engine stopped in November 1875, the water rose
to 95 feet above the bottom of the well. This would give a difference of
level at the time between the water in the Dudlow-Lane well and the Green-
Lane well of about 80 feet. The velocity of discharge in the 6-inch bore-hole
of Green-Lane well when delivering 817,000 gallons (see Report of Committee,
1875, p. 123) per diem would be 459 feet per minute ; a 9-inch pipe, with
the difference of level of 80 feet, would carry waiter from one well to the
other at a rate sufficient to supply the bore with the quantity of water it is
stated to have yielded. Or, to state it in another way, a 6-inch pipe 4000
feet long and 170 feet head would supply, roughly speaking, the same quan-
tity of water at the same velocity as that which passes through the bore.

    It is therefore evident that there must be fissures, having a large aggregate
area, to enable nature's rocky filter to supply water at the rate of 459 feet

per minute to the 6-inch bore-hole when we consider the smallness of the

available head, for the friction through rocky fissures would be excessive as

--compared with smooth pipes.
    Quality of the Water : Hardness. So few analyses having been given in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

the papers returned to me, and wishing to further investigate some of the
questions flowing out of the inquiry, I was under the necessity of applying

supplied me with information respecting the Liverpool wells in the form
which 1 thought desirable for my purpose.

I append his statement of the analyses of the water of Bootlc, Green-Lane,

Windsor, and Dudlow-Lane wells from 18G8 to 1876, together with very

valuable information kindly given me by Mr. Deacon, the borough engineer,

as to the nature of the wells and the level of the water in the wells on the

dates of the analyses. At my request he was also good enough to supple-

ment it by a table showing the average daily yield of the several wells from

1868 to 1876.

To make the information more complete, Dr. Brown has also, for purpose

of comparison, recalculated the analyses of several Liverpool wells given in

Bobert Stephenson's Beport of 1S50 into the terms of his own analyses ; I

also append these.

Having vainly endeavoured to discover some connexion between the rain-

fall and the yield of the wells by comparing Mr. Deacon's table with the

rainfall table supplied by Mr. Symons, which I also append, it suggested

itself to me that relative hardness might be a test of surface-percolation ; but
Dr. Brown states that " I do not find that there is any regular difference

between the hardness in summer and winter. Differences can be traced to
heavy rainfall and the rate of pumping." It is also clear, from a perusal of
what Dr. Brown says of the Bootle well, that heavy rainfall does affect its

hardness ; but that the effect is only a local one is clear from the resumption

of hardness which took place after 7 days' pumping. As local percolation
means greater danger of organic contamination, it is open to question whether

it should not be to a great extent prevented.

  A perusal of Dr. Brown's statements seems to show that the hardness has

increased from 15° in 1868 to 22°-28 in 1876 in the Bootle well ; in the

Green-Lane well from 13° in 186S to 18° in 1876 ; in the Windsor well from

15° in 1868 to 2U° in 1876 ; and in Dudlow-Lane well from 6|° in 1868

to 7^° in 1876. In some cases the deep-bore water is softer than the well-

water, in others harder.

   On comparing these analyses with those recalculated from Bobert Ste-
phenson's report by Dr. Brown and his remarks thereon, it is impossible not

to be struck with the fact that the Corporation wells at Bootle and Windsor
are now yielding water of almost identical quality with that supplied in
1850, although there have been many intermediate fluctuations. Taken

together with the steady increase of hardness since 1868, it seems to show

that the deepening and boring done since 1850 must have had the effect of

softening the water, but that now it is, through greater pumping strain,

returning to its original hardness ; in fact, the old conditions are reintro-

duced on a larger scale.

It is consolatory as showing that the hardness is not due to the depth or

extent of the contributing area, but to the actual drain on the rocks. This

is a point that demands more consideration than I have yet been able to give

it, pressure of professional work having driven me to the last day almost for

preparing this Beport. I quite agree with Dr. Brown also that there is very

little, if any, percolation of sea-water into the Corporation wTells, and con-

sider his arguments are conclusive on that point; there is no doubt, however,

that sea-water does enter wells in some cases. It is naturally what we

would expect                                                                                       but  each case  must be  taken  by its  own  evidences, and  the
                                                                                                ;

fact remains that though the mean level of the water in the Bootle well was

about 20 feet below low-water mark in 1876 and its distance from the sea
is under a mile, witli the dip of the rocks from the 6ea towards it, yet no
--72 report 1877.

sea-water enters the well. Whether this is due to the great north and
south faults, by which it is cut off from the sea, is a subject for speculation
if so it is easy to understand how those wells belonging to private firms on
the margin of the river are affected by sea-water, while the wells more inlaud

are not.

   On the Cheshire side the Wallasey well is on the margin of the great float,
and is pumped down to below low water, yet it is not affected by the sea

but here, again, the well itself is tubbed, and there is a great covering of

drift over the rock, which may be impervious. In some cases, on the other

hand, the bare rock is exposed in the river without any drift covering. It

appears to me that no general rule can be drawn on the subject, local cir-

cumstances alone determining what wiJl take place.
   In presenting you with this Report I must apologise for its shortcomings,

as there are many points touched upon which require more mature consider-

ation than I yet have had time to give them. As, however, local observers

who win the facts are necessarily the best able to arrange them in a form to
be understood and digested, I trust I may have contributed something towards

a knowledge of the circulation of underground waters.

   At Southport Palace Hotel, Birkdale Park, a boring was made without success

for water, which reached a depth of 180 yards without finding the base of the
Keuper Marls. At Scarisbrook Park, east of Southport, the Red Marls were

penetrated and found to rest on chert, limestone, and grit, which may possibly

belong to the Yoredale series.

   At Poulton-le-Fylde a fruitless boring for coal, after passing through Upper
Boulder-clay, Middle Sand, and Lower Boulder-clay, penetrated the Keuper

Marls to a depth of 179 yards without reaching their base, pseudomorphic crystals

of salt and pieces of gyysuui occurring as at Southport.

   At the North-Eastern Hotel, Fleetwood, a boring was made for water by the

War Office without success, a bed of grit being reached at 179 yards.

In 1876 the hardness varied from 22° to 2ii°, and on 7th Dec., 1876,
                                           it was 25^°.

I do not find that there is any regular difference between the hardness in

summer and winter. Differences can be traced to heavy rainfall and the

rate of pumping : e. g. the hardness of Bootle-well water was taken weekly for
a year ; it was generally about 23°, but after heavy rains it fell to 22° and
21 0, 8, and in very dry weather it rose to 24°. On 1st October, 1875, the hard-
ness was 23°, and on 6th October, when the level of the water was 12 feet

6 inches above the bottom of the well, the pump was stopped for repairs. On

the 8th October the water rose to 34 feet, and there was no unusual variation

in the hardness ; at that time heavy rains began to fall, and on 15th Octo-
ber, the level of the water being 48 feet, its hardness fell to 18°. The

hardness due to magnesium salts was almost the same at this time as before

the change, the difference being due to calcium salts. Pumping was then

resumed on 15th October after the sample was taken, and in 7 days, viz. on

22nd October, the level was reduced to 17 feet and the hardness rose again

to 23°.

Average daily quantity of Water pumped from Wells, 1868 to 1876.

Year.
--78 kei'out 1877.

   The water has undergone a great many variations in composition since
1850, and has now returned to almost the same composition as it had then.
After the deep bores were sunk, the hardness was not much more than half

as great as it was in 1850, owing to the fact that there are extensive alkali-
waste deposits, which yield a large quantity of lime-salts to the water of the

upper strata. By continual pumping since the existing bores were sunk, tho
hardness has gradually risen until it is now slightly higher than it was in

1850. The deeper water is still less hard than the upper water. The fol-

--lowing are reasons for believing that no appreciable quantity of sea-water

reaches the well: If sea-water entered the well one would expect more
chloride of sodium and magnesium salts when tho well is hard pumped and
when there is a less strong flow of underground water from the interior
towards the sea, that is in dry weather. But

   1. The proportion of chloride of sodium is almost exactly the same now

as in 1850.

   2. Tho proportion of chloride of sodium does not vary beyond very narrow
limits, and is very nearly the same in Bootle well as in wells further inland,
such as Dudlow-Lane, Windsor, and Green-Lane wells.

   3. In October 1875, when the hardness was reduced by the simultaneous
stoppage of the pumping and fall of heavy rains, the proportion of magnesium
salts was not altered, the change in the hardness having been due almost

entirely to an alteration in the proportion of lime salts.

   This water has undergone several changes, having deteriorated as the
population around it increased ; but since the sewering of the district and

the paving of the streets were completed it has very much improved and the
composition is now almost the same as it was in 1850. The hardness appears
to be less now than it was then ; but this may be due to a difference in the

test-solution employed, as two experimenters seldom get precisely the same
figures for hardness. The same standard soap-solution has been used for
several years, and the hardness is found to be slowly increasing. It is less in
the deep water than in the upper water.

   The proportion of mineral salts, and especially of the hardening salts, car-

bonate of lime and sulphate of magnesia, has increased very nrach since 1850,
and is still increasing as the well is pumped to a lower level. The deep
water is rather harder than the upper water.

--- total solids 70, nitric acid 12, hardness 36°. The well must have con-

tained nitrates in 1850, which have been overlooked ; these salts, as well as
the chlorides, undoubtedly come chiefly from urine and other sewage matter
with which the ground around the well is saturated. Some of the chlorides
might formerly have come from the sea, but there is no evidence whatever to
show that they do.

    The salts in this water come either from the sea or from the marine beds
in which the well is sunk ; a small quantity of the lime salts also comes
from other sources. Although I do not believe that any of the corporation
wells contain any serious proportion of sea-water, there are private wells on
both sides of the Mersey which do contain appreciable quantities of sea-

water.

nishes an important instance of the intercrossing of the directions in which

boulders have been transported, as it must have come at nearly right angles

to the course of the Eskdale granite boulders, with which it is associated.

The transporting agent was probably floating ice. Mr. Mackintosh bas made

further observations on the derivation of some boulders already known.

In the neighbourhood of the Dee and the Mersey the most conspicuous erratic

in the Boulder-clay consists of a rock which bas been called " greenstone," but

to which the name of hornblendic felstone may be applied. At Dawpool, near

Parkgate (where an immense number of bouldors have been left on the sea-

beach by the encroachments of the waves on the clay cliffs), the two largest

of these hornblendic felstone erratics measure 7 X 5 x 4 ft. and 6 x 4 X 4 ft.

Their most conspicuous companion erratic is Criffel granite, from the S. of

Scotland. In the new dock excavation at Bootlc, near Liverpool, boulders of

the same character predominate, though the principal granite with which

they are associated is Eskdale granite, from near Bavenglass, Cumberland.

Bepcated observations failed to discover any streams of these boulders in

the Lake-district, either by themselves, or in company with the great exodus

of Eskdale granite, which is still represented by thousands of blocks scattered

between the Eskdale fells and the sea-coast. Mr. J. Geikie and Mr. Home

pronounced specimens sent to them to be from the outskirts of the Criffel-

6granite area ; and also regarded a few specimens of associated Silurian-grit
boulders to be derived from the S. of Scotland. Lake-district Silurian-grit

erratics, however, are associated with granite at Dawpool, as well as Enner-

dale syenite (streams of which may be seen between the mouth of Enncrdale

and the sea), Wastdale scree-rock, Dudden fclspathic breccia, &c.

The extent to which these different assemblages of erratics from different

points of the compass have become mixed up and interwoven is one of the

most unexpected results at which an observer could have arrived.

   The Bev. J. Caswell, St. Mary's College, Oscott, has examined the district
in the neighbourhood of the college, and supplies the following list of boul-
ders met with (p. S3). The numbers (thus, 50-43) refer to square miles of
country, as described iu the Beport of the Geological Section of the Birming-

of Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle. Most of the small ones, which were
exceedingly abundant, have been moved by man, and are used on some roads

group lies on the side of a hill facing nearly E. They are visible in one
field, but the upper part of the .slope is covered with dense underwood and
timber, in which others may possibly be concealed. Some of these boulders
are of compact felstonc, and others of granite.

                                                      Shropshire.

   Mr. C. J. Woodward, of Birmingham, reports that he has walked over
a considerable portion of the district having St. George's, Shropshire, as a
centre, and a three or four miles radius. In the whole district boulders
occur, though at times one may walk for a mile or so and not meet with them.
Their apparent absence, Mr. Woodward believes, is frequently from accidental
circumstances ; for, as mentioned by him in the Report of this Committee for
1873 (British Association Report, 1873, p. 192), many boulders are buried
as soon as mot with by farmers, many, too, get broken up for road purposes.
The most likely place to meet with boulders is about the buildings of a farm

or at the corners of streets in villages, for in these places the stones serve a

useful purpose, and consequently are not destroyed. The size of the boulders
in this district is- from 2 to 3 feet in length, by about the same in width and
thickness ; but besides these, which are boulders proper, there are stones of
various sizes down to pebbles, composed of the same kind of rocks, and indis-
tinguishable from what are commonly called boulders, except by their size.
The number of boulders per square mile in the district is probably from

   to 200 or so. The boulders consist mainly of granite and felstonc. In
the neighbourhood of Lilleshall Hill are several boulders, which consist of
compact felstonc, containing iron pyrites and garnets. Boulders of similar
rock, containing garnets, have been met with at Wightwick, near Wolver-
hampton, and in a lane near Wroxeter, Salop.

                           Hertfordshire.

Boulders are found at Boyston and Ashwell, upon which Mr. II. G. Ford-

ham, of Boyston, reports. The characteristic materials are a millstone-giit

and a fine compact sandstone, the latter being the most prevalent. Tn the

village of Ashwell there are as many as forty boulders, the largest of which
is 3 x 2-G x 1*6 ft. It is much worn and rounded by exposure to the wheels

of carts. Another smaller cubical boulder measures about a foot in each

direction, and is of fine yellowish sandstone. Other boulders of this material

occur of larger size, up to about 2 ft. 6 in. in the longest diameter. There

are patches of Boulder-clay and gravel on most of the neighbouring hills,

and probably these boulders have been derived from them. These gravels

are mostly composed of Hints, but they also furnish fossils and fragments

from the Oolite and Lias.

In Boyston is a boulder remarkable for its size and history. It is of

millstone-grit, and measures 4 ft. 8 in. X 3 ft. 6 in. X 2 ft. 2 in. The history

--of this boulder, so far as known, is given in the notes to ' Boyston Winter

Recreations in the Days of Quceii Ann ' a translation from a Latin poem

printed in 1710. It has been used as the footstone of a cross of considerable

antiquity, and is now preserved in the garden of the Boyston Institute.

3x2x1Two boulders, one of millstone-grit,  ft., with rounded angles,

and another of sandstone, smaUer, occur in the garden of a house in Mel-

bourn Street.

   In the district the boulders are used for paving, marking the sides of roads,
and protecting the corners of buildings.

                                                                                  South Devon.

   Mr. Pengelly reports as follows respecting boulders and scratched stones in
South Devon :

In 1875 Mr. P. F. S. Amery wrote me respecting boulders of "green-

stone " on his father's estate of Druid, near the town, and within the parish,

of Ashburton                                                                      and during a visit there, in July 1876, he kindly accompanied
                                                                    ;

me to inspect them.

   The boulders occur about -5 mile north-west from Ashburton, in two ad-
jacent fields, the easternmost being known as Loin/bottom, whilst that on the
west of it is termed Cole's Bottom. In the southern corner of Longbottoni

there is a boulder measuring 2-i x 18 X 11 inches, having rudely quadrilateral

faces, with the angles well rounded off. It contains no marks or scratches,

and it is known that it does not now occupy the place in which it was found,

which, however, was, no doubt, in the same field and not far off. It is now

near the bottom of the field, and about 30 feet above the level of Ashburton,

which is itself about 200 feet above mean tide.

  A similar but smaller stone occurs on the opposite side of the same field.

The soil on which both specimens lie, and in which they were found, is a

clay, sometimes yellowish and sometimes bluish, in which stones of the same

character as the boulders, but of much smaller dimensions, are numerous.
The labourers term them " water-stones."

   Near the top of Cole's Eottom there are the fragments of a boulder, which
must have been considerably larger than either of those already mentioned,
which it resembles in Hthological character. It M'as encountered by the
plough in 1875, and unfortunately broken in pieces and dislodged by the
workmen who found it. The fragments, which are themselves of consider-

able size, are now lying by the hedge in the same field. The boulder appears

to have bad all its angles rounded off, like those already mentioned; but on
what was probably its lower surface there are several grooves, sensibly

straight, about 6 inches long, from 2 to 3 inches broad, and parallel to one

another. These grooves are crossed and partially effaced by two others of

greater breadth. This specimen is about 70 feet above the level of those in

Longbottom, and rather further from Ashburton. It must be confessed that

the grooves it bears do not impress one with the conviction that they arc of

glacial origin                                                                    and were it not that they occur on what was                                                                                                           apparently  the
                                                                               ;

lower surface of the mass, they might rather, perhaps, be ascribed to the

plough.

   The only greenstone formations known to exist in the immediate neigh-

bourhood are those forming Roborough Hill, on the eastern side of North
Street, Ashburton, and Sparnhani Hill, on its western side; but to have
travelled from either of them, the largest boulder must have ascended an

acclivity to the height of 200 feet above the valley separating the spot in

which it was found from the hills just named                                                                                                                                                                                            whilst the smaller specimens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

must have performed a similar journey, but failed to attain so great a height.

    In July 1870. Air. Paige-Browne, of Great Englebourne, Harberton, South

Devon, was so good as to inform me of the existence of a large number of
boulders in his neighbourhood, and to invito me to make him a visit for the

purpose of a joint inspection of them. I availed myself of this invitation
--80 kepokt 1877.

on tho 28th of the following September, and on the next day we proceeded
to the hamlet of East Leigh, also in Harberton parish. On our way thither

Mr. Paige-Browne directed my attention to the frequent occurrence of large

stones, of a reddish colour, in the foundation courses of hedges and other
rough walls, and all differing strikingly from the slate or "shillet" of tbe

district. These were the outposts, so to speak, of the boulders we were to

examine ; and whilst they were considerably smaller than most of the spe-
cimens to be visited, they were so large as to render it probable that they

had not been transported by man from any great distance, but had been

found near at band and utilized.
    At East Leigh, about a mile north-westerly from Englebourne House, and

nearly as far in a south-westerly direction from the village of Harberton,
boulders arc very numerous and of great size. They are generally angular
and subangular, but with one face more or less rounded, and even polished,

but without any scratches or strise. They are all of a red colour and jaspi-
deous aspect, and so siliceous as to scratch glass readily. One of them, pro-

--bably the largest of the group so near a cottage-door that we felt called

on to apologize to the inmates for our seeming intrusiveness when engaged

--in examining it mcasuics 17x10x5 feet, and, taking its specific gravity

at 2-5, its weight can be little less thau 60 tons. It lies on the common soft

shillet of the district, and is certainly a travelled block. This is, no doubt,

the history of all the numerous blocks near it.

  A short distance towards the north-west there is in a field a large mass

of the same kind of rock, rising above the soil, and probably in situ, having
on it a loose, but in all likelihood untravelled, block of the same character.
Both of them, and especially the upper one, are smoothed and rounded on
certain parts of the surface. Indeed one portion of the upper stone has a
polish a lapidary might envy ; but it was no doubt produced by the rubbing

of cattle. Neither of the stones is scratched or striated.
    East of these blocks, in the adjoining field, is the striking and abrupt pile

known as Berry-Stone Rock. It is distinctly stratified and jointed, and is,

--I have no doubt, the undisturbed remnant of a much larger mass the parent

of all the numerous boulders covering the district immediately on the south
and it seems more than probable that some of the isolated masses rising above
the greensward, not far from the Hock, as well as in the adjacent field on
the west, are untravelled, undisturbed prolongations of the same mass.

    In tho south face of the pile, which is almost vertical, Mr. Paige-Browne

detected fragments of crinoidal stems, and we found subsequently obscure
casts of Brachiopods, all of which we left uutouched. Information has
reached me that Mr. Champcrnowne, E.G.S., of Darlington Hall, has since
found several corals in the same mass, but none of them sufficiently perfect

for specific identification.

   Mr. Paige-Browne informed me that a common mode of freeiug cultivated

&ground from boulders was to dig deep adjacent pits, into which, by under-
mining, they were caused to fall, and were then buried. The process, how-

ever, being attended with risk, is not now much resorted to, as the workmen

object to it.

   Whilst descending to Leigh Bridge, on the cast of Berry-8tone Hock, we

entered a very small field, in which the boulders were very numerous, and

many of them of great size. Here we found an intelligent villager named
Heath, who stated that all the blocks of which he had had experience lay either
in the common soil, or on rock utterly unlike themselves ; that unsuspected

boulders of precisely the same character were frequently encountered iii tho
ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALKS.  S7

district by men engaged in cutting deep gutters and drains, and that they
were sometimes of such dimensions as to render it much the wisest course to

leave them undisturbed and to deviate from the proposed line of excavation.

   From the observations I was able to make, and the information furnished

to me, it appears that the boulders occupy a zone, about "75 mile long and ·-">
mile broad, south of an east-and-west lino from Leigh Bridge on the east,
through and a little beyond the Berry-Stone Hock on the west, and that
none have been detected north of that line.

   The Berry-Stone Bock occupies a place in the map of the Geological Survey
of Great Britain, but it does not appear that Sir H. De la Beche, or any other

Writer, has directed attention to its remarkable character, or to the multitude

of boulders lying in its vicinity and undoubtedly connected with it.
   Having learnt that, on account of the proximity of the numerous and very

large boulders, its limited extension, its supposed metamorphic character, its
dissimilarity to all the other rocks of the district, and its resemblance to
certain metamorphic rocks surrounding Dartmoor, it had been suggested
that the Berry-Stone Bock was itself an erratic block, and derived probably

from Auswell Mod; about 8"5 miles due north, I decided on making it a

second visit, and requested that, as a preliminary step, an excavation should
be made immediately adjacent to its southern or precipitous side. Having

secured the ready consent of Mr. Helyar, of Coker Court, Somerset, who is

the proprietor of the land, and of Messrs. E. and E. Whiteway, the tenants,
this was done ; and on the 25th May, 1877, I proceeded, with Mr. J. S.

Amery, to the spot, where we found Mr. Paige-Browne and Mr. E. Whiteway.
Two pits had been dug, one five feet deep and the other somewhat less, the
work having been stopped in each case by the occurrence of a mass of rock,

which was either a large boulder or a subterranean prolongation of the Berry
Stone in situ. In short, there was no indication that the base of the pile
had oven been approached.

   The entire mass is rudely rectangular in form, measuring 145 feet long in
an east and west direction, 56 feet high from the top of the southern face
to the bottom of the deepest pit at its base, 11 feet high on the northern
side (the difference in height being clue, not to the form of the pile, but to
inequalities in the level of the ground), and 32 feet broad at the top. The
beds dip at about 2G° towards the north, and are of considerable thickness,
one of them measuring 7'5 feet ; and the numerous well-defined joints are
sensibly vertical, in no instance " open," and have a north-and-south

direction.

    It will be seen from the foregoing data that the portion of the pile which
has been actually examined contains upwards of 250,000 cubic feet, and, at

--a specific gravity of 2-5, weighs upwards of 18,000 tons facts sufficient of

themselves to show that the Berry-Stone Bock is certainly not a travelled
mass, but is distinctly in situ. According to Professor Heer (see his ' Prinmeval
World of Switzerland,' edited by James Heywood, M.A., F.B.S., 1876, vol. ii.

--p. 181), the largest block in Switzerland the "Monster Block " on the hill

of Montct near Devent--contains no more than 161,000 cubic feet, that is,
less than two thirds of the volume of the Devonshire pile ; and we learn from

the First Beport by the Committee on Scotch Boulders (1872, p. 24), that
the largest block they have detected-- that at Kemnay, in Aberdeenshire

measures 38x30x10-5 feet, =11,970 cubic feet at most; i. e., less than

one twentieth of the bulk of the Berry Stone.
    If these aro the measures of the greatest efforts of Switzerland and Scotland

our Dartmoor, and which we know were the scenes of glacial labours on a
most magnificent scale, whilst we have done no more than, if we have done

--so much as, to show that Devonshire was glaciated at all Ave can scarcely

hesitate to dismiss the hypothesis of the Berry-Stone Rock being a travelled

block.

    Again, to have travelled from Auswell Rock, or any spot in that neigh-

bourhood, the blocks must have bid defiance to at least many of the hills and
valleys of the interjacent country. True, their route for a part of the way

might have been the Dart valley ; but they must have left this as high up
as at Staverton, and been regardless of the contour of the country throughout
the residue of their journey ; and since they abound at the level of the River
Harber, at Leigh Bridge, that contour must have closely resembled that
which obtains at present. Of those at a distance from it, there are none at
so high a level as the base of the Berry Stone itself.

    Further, had the Berry-Stone Hock, or any of the undoubted boulders

south of it, travelled from Auswell Rock, we might surely have expected

that, here and there, and at by no means wide intervals, blocks of the same
character would have presented themselves in the intervening country ; but
it is admitted, even by those who have diligently sought them, that, so far
from any thing of the kind being met with, the boulders of East Leigh, as
alii arly stated, are confined to a narrow zone, having the Berry-Stone Bock
on its northern margin, and without a single block to tho north of that pile.

    Finally, it is difficult to believe that such a mass could have fallen on a
glacier without being divided along some of its numerous joints ; in other

words, that a pile traversed by so many divisional planes could, after such a

fall, have remained so large.
   The foregoing reasons, as well as the general aspect of the rock, forbid tho

acceptance of the notion that it is a travelled block, and compel me to hold

that it occupies the place it always did, and that it is the parent of the nu-
merous blocks scattered over the district immediate!}' on the south.

   With regard to the characters which distinguish it so strikingly from tho

surrounding formations, if it has undergone metamorphosis at all, the fossils
it yields show that it has not been to an extent sufficient to obliterate them.
Unfortunately they are too ill-preserved for specific identification, so that they
fail to tell us whether they belong, like the Auswell Rock, to the Carboniferous
period, or, like the adjacent "shillet" and slate, to the Devonian era. If,
however, the Rock has been metamorphosed, it is not inconceivable that

subterranean granitoid rocks may exist in various directions very far from
Dartmoor, and, without reachiug the surface anywhere, may in certain places

rise very near it in sharp conical masses, and that such metamorphosis as

the Berry Stone has undergone may be due to such a subterranean boss.

Such an explanation of the highly metamorphosed condition of the rocks

--extending from the Start Point to the Boll Tail, in the southern angle of

Devonshire the cause of which is no more exposed to view than in the case

--now under notice has been suggested by Dr. Harvey Hull, F.G.S., and the

late Mr. Bcete Jukes, F.R.S. &c. (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. Lond. vol. xxiv.
pp. 439, 440, 1868, and ' Notes on Tarts of South Devon and Cornwall,'

       . p. 15), and a glance at the known distribution of the granitoid rocks
in Cornwall, Devonshire, and Lundy Island will show that it has at least an

air of probability.

   The extension of the Berry-Stone pile, though now confessedly very limited,
was of necessity considerably greater before the crowd of huge boulders wa3

severed from the mass; and, as already stated, there can be little doubt that
           ON THK ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.                     89

at least some, of the so-called boulders rising through the greensward in a

line with the Berry-Stone, and on the west of it, are indications of its subsoil

prolongation in that direction.

  A degree of resemblance to the Auswcll Rock may be the result of simi-

larity of composition and of exposure to corresponding treatment. It may
be sufficient, perhaps, to justify the question, " Has the southern been derived
from the northern mass?" but not sufficient to justify an affirmative reply.

   I cannot conclude this note without expressing my gratitude to Mr. Paige-
Browne for having directed my attention to phenomena so unexpected and

so striking as the Leigh boulders, and which are certainly amongst the most

pronounced indications of ice-transportation known to me in Devonshire.

                               Leicestershire.

Mr. J. Plant, of Leicester, reports as follows:

                               IsoJa ted Bo ulde rs.

Loseby, Leicestershire, about 9 miles from Leicester. Gravel-pit, in map

under letter o in Loseby. 4| feet long, 3 feet wide, 3| feet deep. Sharp

angles and edges on one side, the other side rounded off.         Long shape never
                                                                                                                            ;

moved by man ; S.E. by S. No groovings can be seen. Granite. About

650 feet above the sea at mean tide Liverpool.

The erratic is in a gravel-pit of " drift," flint, rounded pebbles of liver-

quartz, &c. ; this gravel-bed forms part of a long "ridge" of drift-gravel ; the
pit opened is 20 feet deep, and rests upon gravel, which again lies upon the
upper clays of " Lower Lias."

   This "erratic" is 10 miles distant from its nearest possible source, and is

the largest of this kind that I have found at that distance. It is reported to

me that when working (some years ago) this gravel-pit, a large block of pure

coal (as large as this " erratic ") was found, but it was speedily utilized for

domestic purposes.

   I was informed of another block of coal (large size) found in a gravel-pit at
Beeby, 4 miles west of Loseby. These blocks of coal must have travelled in
ice, as they would certainly have been broken up by any other means of

transport, such as water. Both blocks were buried many feet in the gravel.

   i have never met with any " erratics " of any kind on the " marlstonc,"
and, in fact, there is very little " drift " upon any of it, the red rock being
nearly at the surface ; and hence the name of these marlstone-districts, " the

red lands." The mean height of the marlstone is G80 feet, all lying south,
south-east, and east of Leicester, and the mean height of Chain wood Forest

(the presumed source of these erratic blocks of granite, syenite, greenstone)
is about 700 feet ; there are a few peaks 840 feet, and one, Bardon Hill,

802 feet.

                               Groups of Boulders.

--Group No. 1. At Evington, about 1 mile east of the town of Leicester.

The size of the boulders is from 3 feet x 2| x 1| down to cubic blocks about
1 foot on each side. The greater part have sharp angles and edges, and when

free  of  clay and  sand  the  rock-surface is very   fresh, not  at  all  weathered
                                                                                                                     ;

the grits and sandstone arc rounded and worn.

Many of the limestone blocks are covered with grooves and scratches.

Iloeks at south end of Charnwood Forest would supply the granite, syenite, and

stone, and limestone. Nearly half are granites, others millstone-grit, with

limestone, chert, Triassic sandstone, and coal-measure sandstones. About

Fourth Report of a Committee, consisting of Prof. A. »S. Herschel,
   M.A., F.R.A.S., and G. A. Lebour, F.G.S., on Experiments to
   determine the Thermal Conductivities of certain Rocks, showing

    especially the Geological Aspects of the Investigation.

Having been led during the past year, by a renewal of their appointment
(with the provision of a grant amply sufficient to enable them to recommence
it), to pursue, and if possible to complete the experimental investigation in
which they have now for the fourth year been engaged, of the Thermal Con-
ductivities of certain Bocks, the Committee have attempted to complete this

research as far as the different kinds of rocks within their reach appeared to
offer geologically the most practical inducements to fix their places exactly
in a thermal-resistance scale, and to verify as certainly as possible the re-
sults of the observations which they have obtained in former years.

    The same form and size of rock-plates, the same steam-heater and cooler,
and exactly the same form of thermopile as that described in the account of
the experiments presented in last year's lleport were resorted to in order to
extend, and in part also to repeat, some of the former experiments in this
year's series of similar determinations. The apparatus was, however, modi-
fied in some essential points, in order, by changing entirely the circumstances
of the experiments, to leave no doubt of the reality of the observed thermal
conductivities, and of the extent to which their values can be trusted as repre-
senting correctly the true conductivities of the rock-specimens examined. For
this purpose a new thermopile was constructed, having as one of its elements
iridio-platinum instead of iron wire (German silver being, as before, the

other clement), which, with the fine gauge (0-4 mm., rolled to l>2 mm.) of
the wires used, was not so destructible as iron, while it yielded with German
silver a thermoelectric current whose electromotive force was scarcely less
considerable than that obtained with a combination of iron and German silver.
The series of twenty-four junctions of dissimilar wires contained in the con-
tinuous circuit which enclosed the rock, while opposite to each other (above
and below the rock-plate) in twelve pairs, were so distributed equally over
its area as to indicate by their total action an average difference of tempera-
ture between its faces for all the different points of the area of the plate *.
The wires, where not used to touch the plate, were secured to a band of thin
leather 4 or 5 inches wide, two similar bands of thin silk above and below

the rock-plate forming the rest of their support, so that the rock-plate could

be placed between the two silk bands in a flexible loop of a twelve-fold coil
of wires, the right half of which consisted of German silver and the left of
iridio-platinum half-turns of the coil. The latter were cut through, and

being joined to twenty-four ends of German-silver wire in a water-bath,

which proceeded from as many teeth of a commutator, it was easy (as described
by a sketch of the arrangement in last year's Report) to note the actual mean

temperature of cither the upper or the lower set of junctions touching the
rock-plate, by varying the temperature of the water in the hath until no
current passing through the galvanometer indicated that the water in the
bath had reached the same temperature as that of the set of junctions above
or below the rock-plate with which the junctions in the water-bath had been

connected up.
    Several independent proofs having already been obtained that water, with-

out convection, possesses a thermal conductivity which is not only high
among liquids, but is actually not inferior to that of some solid rocks whose
place is low in the conducting- scale, no difficulty was anticipated in making
the wire junctions assume identically the existing temperatures of the rock-
faces touching them, nor was the bibulous or porous stratum of thin silk upon

which they rested, when soaked with water, expected to vitiate the observa-

tions by any inequality of temperature in a water-filni of such exceeding
thinness, touching the rock, in which the thermopile wires were placed. In
order to press them close, smooth sheets of unvulcanizcd india rubber were
placed outside of the wet silk ; and the wires being thus effectually squeezed
against the rock with a simple luting of pure water (which, under the pressuro
of 4 lb. per square inch on every part of the surface, could nowhere well
attain half a millimetre in thickness), the equality of their temperature with
that of the rock-face contiguous to them might be regarded as assured. In
some of the most porous rocks, as chalk and firestone, the water laid on the
silk was nearly absorbed by the stone, leaving the silk damp, but steaming
and as equally steady and satisfactory observations were yet obtained in theso

cases when air and water-vapour must to a great extent have replaced the
water-film, it deserves a future trial if steam (and it may be even air) in
such an extremely thin film as contained the wires in these experiments may
not be as effective a medium of heat-conduction with which to surround the

wires as water; but, beyond the evidence that air saturated with water-

vapour (at a tension of a few inches of mercury, and at a temperature of

110° F. to 130° F.) is as efficacious as water itself, no special experiment

with the thin wire thermopile to solve the question as regards dry air alone

was made in further trial of what would he, if found to he successful, a

practically very valuable simplification.

The other variations introduced in this year's series of experiments were

to increase the temperature differences and the heat-flow through the tested

plates by removing all but the most necessary sheets of caoutchouc lining

between them and the heater or cooler, and by raising a more rapid supply

of steam in the heater with a stronger flame. The actual temperature of the

plates was also raised in 6ome experiments by shifting all the movable

linings from underneath to above the plates so as to bring the latter further

from the cooler and nearer to the source of heat. The success of these ex-

periments was only partial, because, in the strong temperaturo differences

which prevailed (when temperatures between 130° F. and 160° F. were

noted in the water-bath), false currents arising from want of homogeneity

in the heated wires presented themselves in the thermopile, which, in spite

of the number of its coils, did not neutralize each other entirely ; and it was

found necessary to test it very carefully (as described in the last Report)

by introducing a hot paper-covered thick plate of iron between the lappets

of the thermopile in place of a rock-specimen, and observing the temperatures

of its two faces at the water-bath. Errors of indication of the thermopile

were thus discovered, and were noted at different temperatures of the iron

plate, arising from the abrupt changes of temperature along the wires. The
way in which the temperature of the water in the bath was changed, quickly

or slowly, from hot to cold, or vice versa, seemed especially to influence these

considerably                                                      and it  was  finally  resolved to  abandon  the attempt to obtain
                                                               ;

new results, by these means, of the thermal conductivities of the rock-plates

at higher temperatures and under very different circumstances of the heat-

flow through them from those which had been employed before, although the

known allowances for the small erratic deportment of the thermopile always

gave under these entirely new conditions results which did not differ appre-

ciably from those which were previously observed, and which have been re-

corded in the earlier tables of these Reports. Temperatures of the rock-

faces between 100° F. and 120° F. were found by trials with the iron plate

to be easy to observe correctly in the water-bath, with proper care in its
management, with errors not exceeding two or three tenths of a degree,

while the temperature differences requiring to be thus observed varied from

between 3° and 4° with quartz to between 30° and 40° with shale and sand.

About this range of temperature of the rock-faces was accordingly adopted,

by properly thickening the lining between them and the heater, in the expe-

riments which afforded the following table of results (p. 94). While it would
be necessary, in order to deliver the individual wires of the thermopile from

strong effects of temperature-differences, and to obtain scientifically accurate

results, to discard steam-heating and the use of temperatures much above

those of the outer air altogether, resorting for, example, rather to cold water

from a main to produce the temperature difference necessary to transmit heat

through the rocks, or using water otherwise cooled artificially in the cooler,

and exposing the under surface of the rock with a lining and a metal plate

to the ordinary temperature of a room, yet with the small uncertainties

which, without doubt, remain in the indications of the thermopile from the

cause here pointed out, in this and in all the earlier tables of absolute con-

ductivities and resistances which the Committee has appended to its Reports.

ii can furnish some additional support from these provisional experiments to
the assurance which it has already gained in former years, that the values
assigned to them will not be found to differ, except in some rare accidental

cases, more than 10, or, in the least satisfactory cases, it may ho 15 or 20 per
cent, from the real thermal conductivities of the rock-plates examined. The

heat-capacity of the cooler and the rate of loss of heat through it to the outer
air were reobserved, and Avcro used independently in the preparation of this
Table, although they differed slightly (perhaps from setting and tightening
of its jacket with time) from similar measures of them which were used

last year.

   The conductivities observed this year are, for the most part, a little higher
than those found formerly, perhaps by reason of the new determinations used
of the heat-capacity and heat-loss of the cooler : but some exceptions to this
rule are also found ; and it must be remembered that no allowance is made
in these or in the earlier results for the small quantity of heat absorbed by

the rock-plate itself during the progress of an experiment, nor, again, for
the fact that the rate of absorption of heat and of its emission to the outer
air by the jacketed vessel of the cooler is dependent on the rate of rise of

water temperature inside it. The specific heats of the materials of the
rocks themselves and of the apparatus are not sufficiently known to determine
these corrections surely ; but at the common specific heat (0-2) of a great
number of rocks it appears that about one thirtieth of their values may have

to be added to the observed conductivities for the first of these considerations.
Whether an additive or subtractive correction is required for the second
cause cannot be decided, because it is an uncertainty already occurring in
the determination of the heat-capacity and rate of heat-loss of the cooler,
the judgment necessary in assigning which must be regarded as providing
sufficiently for this correction. Thus a correction for heat-capacity of the
cooler vessel and its jacket of one tenth was added to the conductivities beforo
observed directly, while one eighth was added in the experiments of the
present year, allowing a rather longer time (of three or four minutes) for the

heat to penetrate the vessel and its jacket. At the 6low rate (about 1° F.
in the same time) that the temperature of the water rises in the cooler
 during an experiment no higher correction than this could well be admitted
 for after this length of time the loss of heat from the water depends sensibly
 upon its escape to the outer air, and no longer perceptibly upon the absorp-
 tion or capacity for heat of the vessel and its jacket, when an experiment is
 made to find the amount of this heat-loss by absorption. The uncertainty
 of this correction must therefore range between one tenth and one eighth of
 the observed conductivities, which have been used as its extreme values in

 different cases. The apparatus may fairly be regarded in other respects as

 perfectly heat-tight in its connexions by the thick belts of caoutchouc which
 surround the tested plate of rock and the meeting ends of the boiler and
 cooler pressed against it by great pressure ; and a thick wooden table
 (through which the padded boiler top just reaches the level of its upper
 surface) prevents any extraneous heat from the source below it from reaching
 the testing apparatus. The discrepancies which are observed can therefore
 only be ascribed directly to two disturbing causes. These are, the imperfect
 closeness of contact of the thermopile wire junctions with the tested rocks,
 and the want of absolute freedom of the wires from extraneous currents
 arising from other actions than those of the temperatures at their points of

 junction. It is impossible to prevent entirely the operation of these dig-

turbing causes ; and the best endeavours of the Committee have therefore been

used to obviate and to diminish the effects of their action as much as possible.

This they have, they believe, accomplished in the main successfully ; but

instances yet frequently occur which show that without special and very

close attention to them the most unequivocal experiment, apparently, may

yet mislead ; and it is not without this recognition and probable explanation

of some of the obvious discrepancies in the accompanying Table that they

venture to produce the values which it contains as probably exhibiting very

approximately the true absolute thermal conductivities of the various rock-

specimens which they have tested.

The quartzites (compact siliceous rocks) from Schiehallion agree in their

conductivities with crystalline and opaque white quartz. Another class of

rocks from the neighbourhood of Schiehallion experimented on is the class

of micaceous sandstones, or flagstones, which cover a large area in the in-

terior of Scotland. The mica, which is abundant in these sandstones, appears

to have imparted to them a slaty cleavage, the plane of which in their actual

positions is seldom horizontal, and is more often 30° or 40° inclined to the

horizon. Like other sandstones they may be readily broken across, as well

as in the direction of their cleavage-planes, and no difficulty occurred in

obtaining some trial sections of them in these different directions. The

result shows that the conductivity increases (on the average of the samples

tried ) continuously from that of heat transmission across to that of its trans-

mission along the direction of the cleavage-planes in the proportion of

firestone kindly supplied to the Committee by Mr. Baldwin Latham, C.E.,

from quarries at Godstone, in Surrey, where it is largely extracted on account

of its unalterable qualities under the action of certain furnace-heats, which

exhibits very regular bedding in the quarries, but of which the cleavage is

yet either insensible or exceedingly imperfect, exhibits no signs of increase

of conductivity for heat-transmission in the direction of the bedding-planes.

But some specimens of altered shale compacted apparently to perfect uni-

formity and hardness by contiguity to the once molten intruder of whin

rock under which they lay, so as to break with the same facility in all

directions excepting where shrinkage-cracks in and across its plane of bed-

ding (apparently like those in whin rocks) have parted it by the heat to

which it lias been exposed, still exhibits a tendency of heat to traverse it

more freely in the direction of its original bedding-planes than in the trans-

verse direction, in the proportion of about 3 : 4 1. The conductivity is, at the

same time, raised considerably by the semifusion of the materials above

that of ordinary shales, of which some new trials which were made this

year aro also included in the present Table.

The specimens of granite, of porphyritic trap rock, and of mica schist

obtained from Loch Bannoch in Perthshire, present conductivities which

resemble very nearly that of the grey Aberdeen granito with which they are

here compared ; and some new trials of varieties of limestone, chalk, and
marble have been made, which maybe regarded as in satisfactory accordance

with what have been previously observed.

was revealed in some of the experiments made with it last year, dry clay

and sand were saturated with it after their conductivities in a dry state had
been tested, the soft materials being placed for this purpose in one of the
thick caoutchouc belts, which was closed at the top and bottom with sheets
of thin paper and gutta-percha tissuo (used to keep water of the thermopile
lappets from the dry saud, and roughened to make it touch the sand per-
fectly inside, like sandpaper, with a coat of sand attached to it with shell-
lac). The water was added to the sand in its cell (by a pipette introduced
below, until it overflowed from an opening in the top), so as to effect its
thorough saturation ; whilst the pressure (of 60 lbs. or 80 lbs.) upon it in
the apparatus would prevent any water from remaining in the cell, except
saeh as was contained in the interstices of the sand. The low conductivities
of dry sand and of dry clay are (for their weights) remarkable; and tho
effect of adding water to them is to increase their low conductivities very

considerably. But the effect is much more evident in sand than in wet

clay, where the possibility of any convection-currents of the enclosed water
assisting the heat-transfer is effectually excluded ; in the interstices of the
sand, on the contrary, however feeble they must be, it is yet possible that

the}' may materially assist the process of transmission of the heat. Jt indeed

appears probable that the fluid freedom of the water in the interspaces which

it fills in the sand may in this case enable gravity to have some share in
carrying through the open channels some ascending currents of warm water

and some descending currents of cold water, in spite of the effects of friction.

If this explanation can bo conceded, it may be fairly granted from the great

increase of conductivity imparted to loose sand by water in its passages,
which will be noticed in the Table, not less than what is found in some
rocks notable for their good conducting qualities, that tho presence of the
water used to saturate the lappets of the thermopile, easily percolating their
silk tissues, must place the thermoscopic wires as thoroughly in contact with
the rock as if they were cemented to it with a thin film of rock at least as
good in its capacities of conduction as some of the best conductors of the
ordinary varieties of rocks which have been examined. The Committee has
recorded this observation of the good conducting-powcr of water contained in
such a vehicle as sand or other freely permeable substance with considerable
satisfaction, from the renewed confidence which it enables it to place in
the method of experimenting which was adopted, and from the fresh assur-
ance that it gives of the correctness of the results which have thereby been

obtained.

   In presenting the results arrived at by these means of experiment during
the past year, the Committee feel very certainly persuaded that the lists of
absolute thermal conductivities and resistances which accompany this Report,
and which are appended in three previous Tables to the earlier Reports of
the Committee during the last three years, arc near approximations (although
they differ by fluctuating and insidious faults of observation from a constant
mean) to those expressions for the thermal conductivities of the most im-
portant and abundant kinds of rocks which it has been one of the Committee':-
principal objects in the present investigation, by the best and in oat conclusive

possible processes of experiment, to ascertain.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors during the year 1876-77,
   by a Committee, consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., R. P. Greg,
   F.G.S., F.B.A.S., C. Brooke, F.R.S., Prof. G. Forbes, F.R.S.E.,

   F.R.A.S.,WAiJTERYi.iGiiT,D.Sc. ) F.G.S.,and~Prof.A. S.Herschel,

   M.A., F.R.A.S. Drawn up by Professor Herschel {Secretary).

The meteoric occurrences and the results of observation and research relating

to luminous meteors during the past year have presented many points of

interest and importance, and, as will he seen in the present Report, they

have occasionally furnished materials for discussion, of which the results

must he regarded as possessing considerable scientific value.

  A large part of the Committee's time and attention since the presentation

of the last Eeport has been bestowed on discussing and comparing together

the summaries and reductions of meteor-registers supplied to them by a few

active observers of shooting-stars at monthly and even at more frequent

intervals from their own and from more extensively recorded meteor obser-

vations, from which a large store of additional information on special and

ordinary showers of shooting-stars has been derived. The object at first

intended to be pursued by the Committee, of providing observers with a full

review of the existing lists of meteor-showers and of the radiant-points of

comets and meteors, with commentaries and instructions how to observe and

project the apparent paths of shooting-stars so as to note their horary num-

bers and to recognize their radiant-points, has, for this reason, not been

carried out. But the large accessions to the known orbits or directions of

individual meteors and of meteor-streams which the past year's observations

have contributed exceeds what the Committee has been able to report in any

previous year, and affords ground for the assumption that the brief delay

in its compilation which has thus arisen will not materially affect the utility

of a complete synopsis of meteor-showers, and of instructions to assist obser-

vers in tracing and identifying them, which, with more leisure in another

year to bestow upon it, the Committee hopes to provide regular and occasional

observers of shooting-stars with at no very distant period.

  A few stone-falls have taken place, or their occurrences have been an-

nounced, during the past year ; but none of these were remarkable for the

size or weight of the discovered meteoric fragments. On the 16th of August,

1875, a small aerolite, weighing about 14 oz., fell in the district of La

Calle and Constantinc, in Algeria. On the 25th of June, 18th of July, and

19th of October, 1876, aerolites are said to have descended in America, the first

in Kansas city, Missouri, about as large as and of the shape of a small oyster-

shell, which struck and nearly penetrated a tin roof, where it rebounded and

lay too hot to be touched immediately. Of these three aerolites little more

Athan the brief announcements of their falls has yet been published.  small

meteoric fragment weighing about three quarters of a pound fell from the

prodigious fireball of December 21st, 1876, near Rochester, in the northern

part of Indiana, U.S.; and aerolites in Missouri, Georgia, and Kentucky,

U.S., are stated to have been discovered, and to be now in Dr. Lawrence

Smith's possession, which fell from detonating meteors seen in the United

States on the 3rd, 20th, and 23rd of January, 1877.

meteorites, together with a review of recent progress in the special ex-
amination and investigation of certain meteoric stones and irons, are inclu-
ded in the last Appendix of this Beport.

    Of the detonating fireballs visible in 1870-77, two appear to have been of
unusual magnificence, that which passed over the northern States of America
on the 21st of December last having traversed a distance of about 1000 miles,

from near the river Kansas to near the town of Eric and the western boundary

of New York state, appearing in a great part of this prodigious flight to

consist of a multitude of fireballs pursuing each other in a cluster of great
length and breadth, produced apparently by a disruption of the meteor
attended with very loud explosions about the middle of its course. Another

surpassingly bright detonating fireball was seen in Cape Colony, South Africa,

on the evening of the 16th of March, 1877, the light and the violence of

Awhose explosion, like those of the last meteor, were quite unusual.                                                 deto-

nating- fireball passed over the southern counties of Ireland on the 6th of

April last, from Wieklow to Cork, off the coast of which latter county it
burst with a very loud explosion. In the Appendix, where these large
meteors are described a uotice of some recent memoirs by Professor von

Nicssl, of Briinn, in Moravia, will also be found, showing that two deto-
nating fireballs seen in Bohemia and Hungary on the 10th of April, 1S74,

and 9th of April, 1870, were directed from a common radiant-point in

Cassiopeia, and must without doubt have been pursuing almost identical orbits
round the sun, which Professor von Nicssl considers there is evidence enough
to show were of a hyperbolic form.

   Descriptions of various large meteors seen in England are given in a fire-
ball list, and also in the first Appendix of this Eeport with more detail,
where sufficient data were collected to enable the meteors' real heights and

the lengths, directions, and velocities of their real courses to be ascertained.
For such determinations more or less complete materials were afforded by
the meteors of July 25th, August 11th, 13th, 15th, September 24th, and
November 8th, 1876, and January 7th, March 17th, and April 6th, 1877,
permitting the heights, the radiant-points, and in some cases the velocities of
these meteors to be assigned. Notwithstanding very conflicting statements
which even professedly exact descriptions of these meteors' paths contain, an

impartial discussion of all the observations allows of their combination and

comparison together, so as to produce the most accordant representations of the

real courses along which these meteors passed over England or the adjacent

Acoasts.                                                  table in the first Appendix contains the most reliable of these

deductions                                                and  sufficiently  distinct  descriptions  of  the  eight  fine meteors

which it records were secured by observations to make the real paths here

assigned to them free from any greater uncertainties than those which

naturally attach to and interfere with exact vision and perfectly correct

descriptions of such unexpected and startling celestial phenomena. The light
emitted by the large fireball of September 24th, 1876, was unusually vivid
and intense, and many remarkable instances of deception as to the real
direction and nature of its source, as well as in the views of tho fireball's

appearance as modified by clouds and otherwise, occurred among the de-
scriptions, some instances of which are cited in the general account given of
this meteor in the first Appendix. The same Appendix also contains a list

of ordinary shooting-stars doubly observed in England during the past year,
a huge proportion of which accordances were obtained from a comparison of
the meteor-register kept by Mr. Denning at Bristol with the published list
of meteors f.cen and recorded by Professor Main's assistants in the Eadeliffe

Observatory, Oxford, the remainder being extracted from this or other pub-

lished lists and from occasional records of meteor-tracks furnished to the

Committee by various observers.

No very important occurrences of star-showers during the past year have

been recorded. The Leonids and Andromedes of November 1876, the

meteors of the 1st to 3rd of January, and the Lyrids in April 1877 were

either very scarce or quite absent on the annual dates of maximum of those

showers,  as  far as  a watch  for  their  appearance  could  be  kept successfully
                                                                                                                                             ;

but clouds prevented observations on the Leonid meteor-nights of November

13th to 15th. Some meteors of this shower were seen on the mornings of
November 19th and 20th by Mr. Denning, who also observed a conspicuous

shower of shooting-stars very similar to the Leonids on the mornings of

November 26th to 29th, with a radiant-point in Leo Minor. The existence

of this meteor-stream in close proximity to that of the Leonids, with which

its meteors may occasionally happen to be confused, deserves attention, and,

Aif possible, exact verification by future observations.          considerable abun-

dance of meteors, amounting apparently to an active star-shower, and inclu-

ding several bright ones, was noticed in America during the night of October

1 8th to 19th, 1876, the radiant-point being approximately between Taurus and

Auriga. Scarcely any Orionids were seen on the preceding and following

nights by Mr. Denning during the annual period of this well-defined October

Ashower.      similar fitful shooting-star shower (unconnected with the Per-

se'ids, since the radiant-point of that shower was far below the horizon at

the time of apparition) took place in New Zealand on the night of August

13th ; and Mr. Corder described a very accurately defined shower of small

meteors from a radiant-point in Pegasus, in about two hours, on the night

of September 21st, 1876, when at an earlier hour of the evening no such

frequency of shooting-stars had been observed elsewhere. Collection together

in such brief and sometimes abundant flights or swarms is a marked and

significant peculiarity of showcr-metoors, and it is very desirable to determine

the position of the radiant-point of the meteor-swarm in such cases with as

much accuracy as possible. In the stormy weather and full-moon light at the

beginning of this year nothing could be seen of the annual January star-

shower ; and on one night at least (that of the 20th to 21st) of the April
meteor-period, with perfectly clear sky, Mr. Denning observed only four

Lyrids during five hours of uninterrupted watch. Although certainly a

shower of very brief duration, this is a very remarkable scarcity of its meteors

to he observed on either the first night following or on the very night itself

of this meteor-shower's expected maximum display in the year 1877.

With the exception of the Persei'ds of August 1876 and 1877, the Gemi-

nids on the nights of the 11th and 12th of December, 1876, furnished the

most abundant annual or periodic star-shower of the year. In point of

numbers (about twenty or thirty meteors per hour for one observer) the

Greminid display occupied a middle place between the above two August

showers, including, like those showers, several meteors as bright as Jupiter

or Yen us, only less attractive in appearance than the well-known Persei'ds,

from their somewhat smaller speed and from the less frequent occurrence of

enduring light-streaks on their courses. The shower was observed in France

as well as in England, and the position of its radiant-point in the north-eastern

part of Gemini was well determined. Of its two nights of chief intensity

the maximum of the shower appears to have been somewhat more strongly

marked on the 11th than on the 12th of December. Of the two August

showers, while that of 1876 was extremely meagre, it was not much surpassed

by this year's display, these having both been (as will be gathered from de-
scriptions of them and of other recently observed meteor-showers in the third
Appendix of this lleport) the scantiest returns of the Persci'ds that have been

observed for several years.

  A numerous collection of newly recorded meteor-showers is contained in

--the same Appendix of this Iieport partly obtained by Mr. Corder's and Mr.

Dcnning's observations between the autumn of the last and the summer of

the present year, and partly by a systematic projection and reduction by Mr.
Denning of long lists of shooting-star observations recently published in this
country and abroad. Inclusive of upwards of 1000 of his and Mr. Corder's
original observations, about 4000 meteor-tracks from these various sources
have been projected and were more or less completely reduced to their
radiant-points \>y Mr. Denning, with results of which the particulars arc
collected, and have here been arranged together in comparative tables by
Mr. Greg. About thirty of the meteor-showers thus observed and extracted

appear to be new to former lists, while about one hundred other previously
known meteor-shower positions are more or less exactly corroborated and
confirmed. The newly recorded showers are also in many cases in better

agreement with comctary shower-dates and positions than any formerly

assigned individual showers had been, and several new examples of cometary
coincidences are offered by them, of which, with fuller details of these new
vigorously and successfully conducted investigations, the third Appendix of

this Ileport contains a complete description.

   The Committee has now to record with profound regret, at the close of its

Report, the death, on the 30th of June, 1877, of Professor Heis. The first
astronomer who systematically devoted his attention to observing shooting-
stars in order to record their radiant-points, and who published in the year
1849 an original list of radiant-points of all the then known meteor-showers,
he began in the year 1842, and continued to superintend without interruption
until quite recently, the simultaneous observations of shooting-stars which ho
instituted in the lihenish and neighbouring towns of Germany and Pelgium
amongst the best observers and most eminent astronomers of those countries,
and which he also collected from observers and astronomers in more distant
lands. With the thoughtful care of preserving to posterity the fruits of his

long-continued records, he undertook, in the last years of his life, the compi-
lation of all the results of his prolonged researches, from the first recorded

observation in the year 1833 to the present time ; and his work * " On the He-

suits of Forty-three Years' Observations of Shooting-stars" was on the point
of publication, and lacked but little final revision from his hands, before his
sudden and unexpected death. To the watchful and unwearying labours of
Professor Heis, which supported its cultivation during the period of indiffer-
ence into which it had fallen after the disappearance of the great November
showers of 1832-36, the present high p&sition which the theory and obser-
vation of luminous meteors has reached among astronomers as an important
addition to the popular branches of their science must be regarded as being
greatly due ; and the direction given by his earliest and latest works to the

formation and promotion of the new science during its rapid stages of de-

velopment will always be accounted by astronomers as one of the foremost of

the great achievements by which he won distinguished and honourable titles

to their grateful recollection.

                                 I. Meteors Doubly Observed.

   In the list of observations of large meteors presented last year, several de-
scriptions are contained which more or less certainly and correctly describe
the same meteor seen at different places. But the observations are not
always very perfectly compatible with each other. The following are the
principal conclusions which, as far as the data would permit, it has been

found possible to obtain from them*. Some of the observations referred to
are described in the list of observations of large meteors annexed to this
Report, especially of the three last meteors mentioned in the present Table,
which were seen after August 1876, and whose real paths have been de-
termined from the accounts of them which are now about to be recorded

(see, for the Table, pp. 134, 13-5.)

       Notes on the Results of the Comparisons presented in the Table.

--1876, July 25, 10h 3m p.m. The descriptions giving accurate particulars

of this meteor's apparent course (at Poplar and Edgeware Road, London,

Brighton, Downham, Hersham, Street, and Burnham, Somersetshire) are

seven in number ; but three of them exhibit anomalies of the meteor's track
among the constellations which put them out of useful reference for calcula-

tion. The meteor's long path appears to have been traced backwards after

its disappearance by a natural tendency of the eye to wander round the sky

at a constant altitude in prolonging a great circle to constellations much

above those from which it was directed. An account received from Burnham,

in Somersetshire, by Mr. Cordcr, states that the meteor passed from Ophiu-

chus through Bootes on a line directed from the constellation Pegasus, a

line which cannot be a great circle on the globe. The meteor's course, de-

scribed at Brighton as being remarkable for its apparent length, is still more

extraordinary by the unnatural deflection at the middle of its track, by which

it proceeded thence on a course about 45° inclined to its original direction.

As far as can be gathered from the only thoroughly consistent accounts of

its apparent course recorded (a correction of " north " to " south " declina-

tion in that at Downham, Norfolk, includes this latter among the most pre-

cise of the descriptions), the particular account of the meteor's course through

the constellations " Aquila and Hercules to Arcturus" at Edgeware Road, Lon-

don, while not self-contradictory like the above, appears yet to be affected

with the same source of error                                                                                                                                                      and it is the only account so signally in con-
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

trast with the remaining well-recorded ones as to make the possibility of two

meteors having been visible, either appearing nearly at the same time or to-

gether, a question which could be reasonably offered for consideration. The

calculated path presented in the Table is derived from the observations at

Street (Somersetshire) and Poplar, with the corroborative evidence shown at

Hersham (Surrey) and at Downham (Norfolk, assuming the above small but

important correction of the point of origin) of its approximate exactness. That

the meteor proceeded from a very low southern radiant- point is pretty clearly

proved by these accounts ; but it is unfortunate that the other circumstan-

tially detailed descriptions of its apparent course point apparently to an origin

of the meteor's flight far north of the equator, and accordingly (if they could

be accepted) to a very widely different conclusion. The point of first ap-

pearance was too far from the observers to be very ccrlainly determined; but

the length and duration of the flight at Street give a velocity (19*5 miles per

second) which does not perhaps exceed the theoretical velocity in a parabolic

orbit (12-3 miles per second) with the radiant-point observed more than can

be accounted for by the unavoidable errors of observation. With regard to

the meteor's appearance, an interesting description of the view obtained of

it (apparently in London, as no place of observation is named in the letter to

'The English Mechanic,' vol. xxiii. p. 668, September 8, 1876, where this

--account appears) by Mr. W. J. Lancaster is as follows : " I saw the meteor

of July 25th splendidly at about 2"1 after 10 o'clock. Its course terminated

far above t; Bootis. In fact I fancied that it was higher than e Bootis, but

of this 1 could not be positive because my whole attention was upon the

meteor. Of one thing I am, however, positive, and that is, that immediately

before it vanished it split into two principal nuclei and a quantity of appa-

rent nuclei. The two fragments were about j and 3 the size of the original,

the  larger  fragment being  the  anterior  one                    the  other  fragment  vanished

sium and zinc with a trace of copper. Some of the fragments burned with a

red tint. I did not hear any sound of an explosion."
   1876, August 11, 11" 22m p.m.--This was a splendid Persei'd fireball, of

which the streak remained visible for a few minutes, assuming a serpentine

form, and which was visible from Sunderland in the north to Clifton and

Somerton in the south of England. The length of the light-cloud was about

12 miles, and it must have been fully half a mile in width before it disap-
peared, at the height of 50 miles above the earth's surface, 20 or 30 miles
northward from Swansea and Cardiff, at which it was deposited. The metcir

produced a white lightning-like illumination 'over S. Wales and the whole

country in the neighbourhood of the Bristol Channel. No durations of its

flight were, unfortunately, recorded by which its velocity might have been
exactly ascertained, as the length of its path and the real height and locality
of its luminous track were very accurately noted and determined The

radiant-point is indicated with some precision, near the usual radian , -point

--of the August " Persei'ds."
   1876, August 13, 9" 27m p.m. The observations of this Persei'd at Bunt-

ingford, near Ware, in Herts, and at Folkestone, arc in perfect accordance

for the point of disappearance ; but the meteor's oblique descent towards

these places makes the distance from them at which it first appeared diffi-

cult to decide. The point of first appearance assigned at Oxford (near a Cas-

siopeia;) limits the height of the meteor there at 1-10 miles ; but a less early

point of appearance by a few degrees at either of the stations diminishes

this height to 90 miles over Walton, where the meteor is taken to have first

entered the atmosphere. Like the last meteor, although penetrating it to

little more than 40 miles above the earth's surface, it gave rise to no audible

--explosion.
    1876, August 15, 9 h 30m i>.m. This fine Aquariad fireball was observed
over an extensive area in England, Wales, and Ireland, and in the Isle of
Man. It crossed the Irish Channel from St. Bride's Bay, near Milford Haven,

to Arklow in Ireland; and the extent of its further flight is imperfectly
known from the distance from all the observers in England who recorded it
which it there attained. At Newtown (Montgomeryshire) in Wales, a news-

136 REPORT 187".

paper might have been read for some time by its light, as it passed along

and it was remarkable for its sustained brilliancy at Bath, Bristol, Ciren-
cester, Swansea, Oxford, Rochdale, at Douglas in the Isle of Man, and at
Cookstown, near Loch Neagh, in Ireland. Its course was noted at the Rad-

cliffe Observatory, Oxford ; and here, as at other more western places over
which its course began, it was followed without extinction to the N.W. ho-

rizon. The observation at Douglas enables the radiant-point to be deter-
mined, to which the observations in the S.W. of England only point back-
wards by a nearly common line. As seen to commence, from the new pier,

over Douglas Head, and to skirt the high ground of that southern headland

of the bay before coming into clearer view westwardly over the town, the
altitude of its horizontal motion westwards from the point of origin nearly

due south cannot have much exceeded 30°, the apparent altitude assigned by

Mr. Binney. If by a reduction which no eye-estimations of altitude near
the horizon can dispense with, 25° or even 20° is substituted for the real

altitude at which the meteor started horizontally westwards at Douglas from

the south meridian, the position for the radiant-point is obtained (by inter-

section with the other projected courses) which is entered in the Table, and

which agrees without discordance with the place which had already been as-

signed to it generally and independently from their common intersection.
The place so found (at 310°, --10°) agrees well with a known radiant centre

for August in Aquarius, close to which the radiant-point of a bright fireball

seen on the 10th of August, 1874, was already found to be situated (as de-

--scribed last year in these Reports), at 313°, 14°, near u, e Aquarii. The

velocity (like that of the fireball there described, of 19 miles per second)

agrees with the theoretical velocity of bodies moving in a parabolic orbit with

this radiant-point.

The President of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, Mr.

E. W. Binney, who obliged the Committee with the present details of his ob-

servation of the meteor at Douglas, has also kindly communicated two other

observations, which it is difficult to reconcile with those of this large meteor,

but which may yet indicate that it pursued its course to a considerable
distance over Ireland. The annexed map of Douglas town and Bay repre-
sents the point (a) on the New Pier from which Mr. Binney relates that he

obtained the first view of the

meteor in the direction a b,

commencing its course over

the New Hotel, whence it

took its flight westward,

skirting the hills of Douglas

Head (whose elevation is

about 300 or 400 feet), until

it passed clear of them, and
pursuing its way over

Douglas town, appeared to

him to vanish in the north-

west near the horizon. Some
friends who saw the meteor

from near the New Hotel

also followed it in view until

it disappeared over Port                 **

north-west direction. The dotted lines 1, 2, 3 are the directions,
respectively, of St. Bride's Bay (Milford Haven), Axklow, and a point
near Mullingar in Ireland. It thus appears that a much longer night
than that above supposed must presumably have been performed; but it

must yet be remembered that intervals of azimuth, like those of altitude, are
commonly far overrated near the horizon ; and the real course of the meteor
was very probably not more prolonged (even if it was so much, at last) at Mr.
Binney's point of observation*, from due south to about west, or a little south

of west.

    Mr. Binney mentions the occurrence on the night before the 15th of August
of another meteor equally brilliaut with this large fireball, which made its
appearance in the west at Belfast. The hour of its occurrence was the same,

and it answered, a correspondent wrote to him, in every particular to the de-
scription of the meteor seen at Douglas ; and no doubt of the date, he added, was

possible, which was the 14th of August. Mr. H. Darbishire, who communi-
cated this intelligence, states that he was on the watch for meteors on the
night of August 15, between 9 h and 10 h p.m., and saw nothing at Belfast re-

sembling the large meteor elsewhere recorded at about 9" 30m on that night.

On the other hand, a notice of such a meteor, seen at Cookstown, 30 miles

west of Belfast, appeared in a later Part of the ' Proceedings of the Literary
and Philosophical Society of Manchester ' (vol. xvi. p. 60, December 12, 1876),
showing that either this fireball, or one perfectly resembling it, was very

brilliant in that part of Ireland at the hour when other observers noted its

appearance.

    The following account of the meteor was given by Mr. N". Staples,
whose letter to him of December 4th, 1876, on the subject of the meteor,

--Mr. Binney then communicated to the Society : " As I noticed in the

Paper that you observed a meteor on the night of August 15th, when in
the Isle of Man, I beg to inform you that a meteor was observed in Cooks-
town, about long. W. 6° 45', on the night of Tuesday, August 15th, about
 9 h 45m, local time, passing over from S.E. to N.W. It was described to me
 as lighting up the whole street ; colour reddish green [!]." Mr. Binney
 adds that the meteor was also seen at Rochdale in Lancashire, but of its ap-
 parent course there he has not been able to obtain particulars. Remarkable

 as was the brilliancy of the meteor at this far northern point in Ireland, it
 is not necessary to assume a further continuation of its course than to such
 a low height as 15 miles over a point; near Mullingar (about 80 miles S.S.W.
 from Cookstown) to satisfy the uncertain information which can alone he
 gathered without recourse to measurements from such a general description
 of the meteor's apparition. The earth-point of its course, as derived from the
 exact observations of its course in England, was 15 miles west from Carrick,

 90 miles S.W. by W. from Cookstown, and instead of passing " over " that

 town towards N.W., if the same meteor (as there seems no reason to doubt)
 was seen there, it must have moved at no great altitude above the south, on a
 slightly descending course nearly towards the west point of the horizon.
 The meteor did not burst or detonate, and left no persistent light-streak on
 its course ; but the strong bluish light of its nucleus cast moving shadows

  in S. Wales, and it was followed by a long train of red and yellow

   sparks.

   --1876, September 24, 6h 30m p.m. Far tbe most splendid meteor seen in

  England for somo years past burst over the English Channel on the last Sun-

 day evening in September 1876. A view of the phenomenon, complete in

  every point from first to last, was obtained of the brilliant spectacle at the
 Orwell Park Observatory, near Ipswich, by Mr. J. J. Plummer, who kindly

 --supplied the Committee with the following details * : " It was bright twi-

 light throughout the whole time (from Gh 31 ra to 6h 47m, local time) that the
 meteor and its streak were visible. The whole course (whose length I esti-

 mate at 25°, traversed in about 3 seconds) may be divided into three por-

 tions (roughly equal) in order to describe it accurately. In the first portion
 its brightness was not remarkable, though it exceeded a first-magnitude star.

 In the second or middle portion it rapidly increased in brilliancy to many

 times the brightness of Venus, and then almost suddenly sunk to its former
 magnitude. In the third portion it again increased in brilliancy, this time

 much exceeding its former maximum, and with the like suddenness was to-
 tally extinguished. This portion of its course was, however, marked out by

 a narrow luminous train, about 6° long, and with scarcely perceptible width,

 which enabled mo to fix the position of the point of disappearance [by a com-

 parison with the neighbouring planet Saturn, about 3° below it] with con-
siderable precision. There was no explosion ; no noise. The diameter of
 the disk could not exceed 2' [the inappreciable width of the light-streak
plainly betokens this], and might have been less, and was slightly pear-
shaped, which appearance may, I think, have been due to the persistence of
the impression on the retina. It is very difficult to estimate with any accu-

racy its maximum brightness, as there is no object in the heavens with which

to compare it. I have recently shown that Venus has only ^jj of the bril-
liancy of the full moon, and there is thus a very wi'de gap between these two
standards of reference as regards brilliancy. If the moon had a diameter no
greater than that at which I estimate the meteor, with the same amount of
light, its intrinsic lustre would of course bo 240 times that it has at present,
making it a very brilliant body. Still
I do not think I exaggerate when I
say that the meteor would be equal to such
a body. The glare closely resembled that
of a very vivid Hash of lightning, for which
it was mistaken by somo persons. After the
disappearance the train was seen as a lumi-

nous cloud drifting slowly northward, taking successively the
following forms (A), and gradually losing its definite outline.
During its visibility it drifted about 12° or 15°. The wind
was south-south-westerly at the time."

  A similar description of the streak to this is given by Mr.

P. Harding, at Ipswich, as shown in the annexed sketch (B)
received from Mr. Corder. " Time, 6h 20m . Apparent size
equal to the moon, but much brighter. Fell very rapidly
from a height of 50° or G0° in the S.S.E. White, followed
by a train of brilliant colours, and leaving a broad streak

  A* similar notice of the meteor, by Mr. Plummer, appeared in 'Nature,' vol. xiv.

p. 505. The particulars of the observed positions are recorded in the list of large meteor
observations included in the general catalogue annexed to this Report.

which lasted some minutes and broke in halves, one halt' gaining on the
other, appearing thus when it began to break up in clouds."

   Tho sharply denned character of the white streak is mentioned by an
observer on the Dunkirk to Calais railway (sec the accompanying catalogue),
who likens it to a straight vertical chalk-mark on the sky ; and at a
few places in England where (as in the neighbourhood of Ipswich), after a
very wet showery day, the sky had cleared in the evening, the luminous streak
which it left was a very notable feature of its unusual appearance.

   The ' Daily News ' gives the following description from the Stoke Hills,

near Ipswich, adding, in some introductory lines on the occurrence, that " it
must have fallen quite close to Ipswich, for the noise when it burst was
plainly distinguishable"; but no other announcements of an audible repoit
having attended it, from places nearer to the meteor's real outbreak and

nearest approach to the earth, as far as the Committee has been able to as-

certain, were elsewhere recorded.
   " It first made its appearance about thirty-two minutes past six, in a S.S.E.

direction, about 60° above the horizon, and above and a little to the right of

Saturn [altitude 11°]. It descended rapidly, leaving a long tail or train of
golden light behind, like a long thin cloud, more or less broken. Just as it
was in a line with Saturn, and apparently about a yard [1°] to its left, it
opened or burst in the middle like a pod with a crackling noise, showing in

the centre a very bright ball of light like the electric light. The light was of
greater intensity than that of the moon at the full, quite illuminating a largo
room from which it was seen. The luminous train or trail was visible for a

quarter of an hour after the meteor burst, at first in the tail-like form with a
marked division in the middle, but soon afterwards the two divisions became

widely separated, assuming the appearance of two horizontal white clouds."
Its appearance at Norwich and at Eramford is also noted in the 'Daily News,'

at the latter of which places it passed from W.N.W. to the S.S.E., " leaving

a stream of light behind it, and casting a lurid crimson belt of light upon
the earth immediately beneath its course."

   At numberless places in England (and on the mainland of the continent)
the intensity of its illumination was a singularity of this meteor, which took
observers by surprise, lighting up the interior even of large rooms where

they were seated, and revealing all objects out of doors with lightning-like

distinctness.

Near Harleston in Norfolk, " a pale light shone through an east window

and passed thence about 6 or 7 feet from the floor of the room to a north

window, like a flash of lightning." It was mistaken for lightning even at

Dymock,  near  Ross  in  Hereford                                           and in the south-eastern counties of
                                                                         ;

England scarcely any persons within or out of doors had not noticed the

peculiar brightness of the flash, which, the day having been sultry, was for

the most part attributed to unusually vivid Hghtning. An outhouse was

thought, in Kent, to be on fire, and apprehension was not much relieved ou
looking up to see that the fire was* in the sky, " as big as a square room,
thrown open," instead of on the earth close by. Tho illumination of the
clouds, where the sky was covered, like that within doors, where the meteor
was not seen, caused many erroneous impressions of its real course and
aspect, to which few accurate particulars beyond what the accompanying

catalogue contains can here unfortunately, from the dark aud cloudy nature

of the evening generally, now be added.

lated position over the latter coast

of the meteor's real course.

At Walton-on-the-jSTaze ('The

Times ") the meteor descended ver-
tically in a south-east by east direction; and this agrees almost exactly with

Mr. Plummer's view of it near Ipswich, from which, with combination of these

observations and of that at Hull, and from the traveller's note of its bright

streak, on the railway between Dunkirk and Calais, marking the sky vciti-

calby in the "north-north-west,'' this approximate place of explosion and dis-

appearance of the meteor over the German ocean is arrived at. The direction

of its downward descent, though nearly vertical, is inclined from south to

north in all the accounts recorded in the south, while this is less observable

in those reported from the neighbourhood of Ipswich. In Paris also the ap-
parent line of motion was " almost perpendicularly " downwards; and a

general comparison of these particulars proves the true place of the radiant-

point to have been about 15° or 20° from the zenith on its S.S.E. side, at a
point then nearly occupied by c Lyras, in lt.A. 285°, N. Deck +35°, as is re-

presented in the Table. If it is exact, this position differs sensibly from the

point, at 311° +52°, from which, as found by Captain Tupman*, a meteor

very similar to this, and almost as strikingly brilliant, fell, off the coast of
Sussex, on the 3rd of September, 1875. The latter radiant-point, a little

west of the zenith, disagrees with the notes of several observers of the fireball

of September 24th, 1876, in the south and west of England, that its falling

path in the east, from their points of view, declined northwards very visibly

from a vertical direction.

 --'The Galignani's Messenger' of Paris thus describes the appearance of

the meteor in that town : " It emerged from the dark storm-clouds at 30°

above the horizon in the northern sky, and descended slowly towards the

earth, emitting showers of sparks and a scintillating train. It fell almost

perpendicularly, and grew elongated in falling ; it disappeared behind houses,
and thereafter illumined the whole northern sky with two successive blazes of

fire like lightning, by which the surrounding clouds were tinged as with gold."

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  Ill

   In ' The Times,' a writer from Broadstairs relates that " from the clouds
an immense body of blue flame, beaded by a brilliant red colour, shot out.
Although no report was heard, it appeared distinctly to explode twice, and
was visible for from 8 to 12 seconds. It left behind it a streak of reddish-
coloured light, indicating the course it had taken." At Waltoii-on-the-Naze,
" the colour was white with a rose edging ; and from the old pier, persons
standing there say they distinctly saw sparks fly off from the meteor as it
rushed down. It left a thin streak of white cloud, which did not wholly dis-
appear for half an hour." The Broadstairs correspondent of the ' Standard
writes that it was '· as large as the sun at noonday, with a sort of crown on
the top and a long pointed tail. The head was of dazzling brightness and
surrounded by a dark rich blue outline, and it left a large white fissure in
the clouds [the white streak] where it passed through them, which remained

about 3 minutes."
   These and similar descriptions (that the meteor-head was " rayed or

spiked," that " it split " and " threw out arms," &c, and that it "rose up,"
lighted the clouds, was perhaps meant, with a second flash), which might be
multiplied, when compared with Mr. Plummer's description (which, with a

clear view of every feature, mentions none of these singularities), may prove

what caution is required not to accept too readily the suddenly received and
often hastily formed and doubtfully recalled impressions which are produced

--upon the minds of unprepared observers by these very startling apparitions.
    1S7G, November 8, 5h 3m p.m. Although the twilight was strong, espe-
cially in the west, when this meteor traversed the central parts of England
from east to west, it was a fino object on most of its course, especially near
disappearance, when it separated into a string of several shiuing globes.
The observers remarked (which may be a misconjecture) that it at the same
time underwent a sensible downward deflection of its course. Its brightness
varied little, surpassing Yenus gradually on its long course, and becoming
Bomewhat suddenly brighter at disappearance, and besides a sparkling train
it left a persistent light-streak, not visible for many moments. By the ac-
count of all observers, it followed with rather slow motion a long horizontal
course from between the north and east to between the south and west, the
long career of the meteor showing also that its real path must have been
nearly horizontal on this course. One exact position only was recorded of
its point of disappearance, by Mr. F. C. Penrose at Wimbledon. The alti-
tude of the early part of its flight in the north from that point of view is
known approximately from an observer's estimate, 30° (equivalent in measured

height to not more than 20°) above the northern horizon, at New Cross. It

disappeared at Wimbledon at an altitude of 9°, very nearly, in the west ; and
 even at Hay, near Hereford in Wales, an altitude of 20° or 25° in the west

Aof the last part of its flight was recorded by approximate descriptions.

very different account from this long course is given by Mr. Brothers at

Manchester, who estimates its whole path at about 40° in length in the S.

 and S.W., altitude about 30° as the least admissible, but at 38° as measured
 from recollection, going almost horizontally between S. and S.W., with a
 gradually descending course towards the west. This and the imperfect ob-

 servations at the two or three other points already mentioned only enable
 its real course to be roughly fixed in space ; and especially its length or extent
 at the starting and disappearing points are quite uncertain. The height in

 miles cannot have been much more or less than from 50 to 30 miles, along

 its course ; and very slenderly accordant as the observations arc for its ter-

 minal positions, the apparent radiant-point of the meteor's flight is yet, by

the common evidence of these three observations, shown with little uncer-
tainty to have been very near the E.N.E. horizon. The meteor was thus found

to have been a ' Taurid ' from the earliest of the three Taurid centres (at 58°,

+ 18°, a noted radiant-centre in November) ; and the characteristic appear-

ance of the meteor was also that which the long bright meteors often seen
coursing the sky from east to west in evenings early in the month present

by the parallelism of their stream to the horizon, and by the brightness of

many of its members, which makes this ordinary meteor system a conspicuous

shower of shooting-stars in the early portion of November.

  --1877, January 7, about 10 h 30m p.m.- Besides tho fine shooting-star

doubly observed at this time in London and at Birmingham, Mr. Denning

has described the occurrence of other meteors seen by himself*, which are

traceable to the same radiant-point in the first few weeks of January. On

the radiant-point near y Eridani, to which he shows that the meteor of
January 7th can be assigned, and on some other meteors seen on the same

--night as this one, Mr. Denning offers the following observations : " I can

confirm the position of this radiant-point from other meteors seen in January,
including one as bright as Venus on the 4th, 8h 51 m p.m., which exhibited

the same slow halting motion as that noted in regard to the fine one seen on

the 7th. I have received other accounts of the latter, but they are mostly

vague. At Bermondsey it was seen at 10b 30m, and described as large and

remarkably brilliant, closely resembling in size and colour the meteor which
appeared on September 24, 1876. It was of a bluish colour, left a long tail
of light, or streak, in its wake, and its course in the heavens was from 8.W.
to N.E. At 10 h 37m, on the same evening, a very large and brilliant meteor
was seen at Lower Clapton, and this no doubt refers to the same object.

    " Mr. Barrington (' Nature,' vol. xv. p. 275) notes another bright meteor
at Gh p.m. on January 19 (Dublin time, or Ch 25m r.M. Greenwich time, see the

account at Bray, below, p. 153) ; but its apparent path shows it to have been

different from one seen by a correspondent at 6 h 27TM, January 19, who writes
that he witnessed a meteor of unusual brilliancy. It moved almost per-

pendicularly in a southerly direction very slowly, the time occupied in its

--passage being about 7 or 8 seconds."
    1877, March 17, 9h 57m p.m. Several observations of this very luminous
fireball were recorded (some of which are included in the accompanying list)
and were collected and compared together, with the results given in the pre-
sent Table, by Captain Tupman. The meteor was exceedingly luminous at
places near its line of flight over the Bristol Channel and in Ireland, as its

body of brightly-coloured light sailed slowly through the sky. "From

Waierford the meteor was seen to be double, one part closely following the
other in the same track f, while the light was so brilliant that the coast of
Kilmore, 9 miles distant, became distinctly visible. All along the track fiery
ashes were observed to fall nearly vertically downwards. At Basingstoke,
90 miles distant, green and red masses of fire seemed to be falling into ad-

Meteor-list, January 7th, 1877, Putney Hill, London.

  At sketch of the double-headed meteor of Seistember 7, 1875, by Mr. H. Corder,

at Writtle, may here be noticed (see these Reports, vol. for

1876, p. 145, footnote), as the division into two heads which

it, portrays is much rarer than the formation of a second

head (perhaps of sparks), like that described in the text, fol-
lowing the principal body of the meteor. Tho two heads,
certainly not in line, after travelling in company for about 20°, Mr. Corder states, dis-
appeared almost together.

jacent fields. From Tctbury, red matter was seen falling after the body of
the meteor was extinguished." The point of disappearance, at 20 miles over

Pontypool, is very well established by several observations, and a good posi-
tion of the radiant-point between Sextans and Hydra is dcducible from the

descriptions. Many estimated durations of the meteor's flight, combined

with a very fair determination of its actual length, give in this case a meteor-
speed which is a little in excess of what would belong to a parabolic orbit
but it should be remembered that only partial views are generally obtained of
a meteor's motion, while more of its real length of path will often be discern-
ible from the streak of light, or sparks, left visible upon its course.

   Among the occasional observations of shooting-stars communicated to the

Committee during the year 1876 (including long lists, especially from Mr.

W. F. Denning, at Bristol, and from the lladcliffe Observatory, Oxford),

several duplicate observations of ordinary shooting-stars have been extracted.

The second List, above (p. 12(i), describes these observations, and it may fur-

nish useful conclusions of their apparent radiant-points to examine these ac-
cordances more critically, which the Committee hopes at some future period

to accomplish. To these it may be added that among the meteor-paths

noted in the list of twice-recorded tracks, one described at Writtle (Chelms-
ford), and at Sunderland at about 10 o'clock p.m., on August 10, 1876, cor-
responds to that of a meteor observed at Bristol simultaneously (at 9 h 54m )
by Mr. Denning, as described in the list of large meteors presented with last

year's Report.

    The following double observation (and a real path deduced from it) was
also obtained, as Mr. Denning has informed the Committee, from his point of

view at Bristol, and from Mr. H. Corder's at Writtle, of a fine meteor well
situated for simultaneous observation between them, which appeared on the

30th of May last (1877), at llh 26m p.m., as recorded at each station :

appearance are somewhat greater than usual ; and the meteor-speed corre-

second instead of 45 miles per second, the actual velocity with which the
meteor appears to have been moving, from this comparison of the correspond-

  --1873, June 17, 8h 46m (Breslau mean time) ; Hungary, Austria, and

Bohemia. In July and December 1873, Prof. G. von Niessl of Briinn, in
Moravia, and Prof. J. G. Galle of Breslau, in Silesia, respectively published
investigations * on the real path of this large detonating fireball, which in
the main corroborated each other with wonderful exactness, although the
accounts which they employed were principally collected from the west and
east sides respectively of the tract of country over which the meteor passed
near the termination of its course. One very striking difference, however,
was exhibited between the independent results which they obtained. While
scarcely three or four miles in the locality (Blernhut or Grosschdnau in
Saxony, on the Lausitzer-Gebirg dividing that province from Bohemia), and

scarcely half a mile in the height (20| miles above the earth), separates the
points of disappearance of the fireball as found by these two computers, while
the radiant-point, or direction of the real path along which the meteor ap-
proached this place, coincides within about 3° in the results of the two
calculations, the meteor was found by Prof, von Niessl to have begun its
flight over a point near Chrudim in Bohemia, at a height of 39£ miles, 92
miles from its point of disappearance ; while the length of its course, according
to Prof. Galle, was 285 miles, and its point of first appearance was far south-
eastward from Bohemia, at a height of 101 miles over Raab, in the southern

part of Hungary. Some observations in Silesia, especially one at Eybnik,
where the meteor appeared at starting to emerge from the planet Saturn, had
led Prof. Galle to this result ; and the following comparison (taken from Prof,
von Messl's later paper) will show how exaggerated it must have appeared
to Prof. Niessl, from all the observations at Briinn, and in Moravia and Bo-
hemia, which he had been able to collect :

       OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.              145

A belief that the planet Jupiter had accidentally been mistaken at Rybnik

for Saturn (although not participated in by Professor Galle) led Prof, von Niessl

to extend his inquiries for descriptions of the meteor to the eastward, and

especially to Southern Hungary : but neither in Hungary nor from any
eastern towns could he obtain fresh proofs of this early commencement of

the meteor's course, nor even any evidence of its having been visible in

Steiermark, about half as far off as Raab (in the same direction) from the
meteor's point of disappearance, until this was at length furnished to him

from Seheinnitz, in Hungary, by Baron A. von Pronay, who had noted the

meteor's passage thorc with the greatest care. Although attracted by its

light from behind, so as not to see its very first commencement, two thirds

of its course, the Baron relates, were traversed with great brightness, but

without leaving any very long-enduring streak. It was only in the last

third part of its course, near the horizon, that the luminous streak was left
which remained visible at his point of view 17m 20s. This point of first

commencement of the streak must, it appears, have been attended with a

considerable increase of the meteor's light, since it was the point almost

universally assigned by all the observers in Bohemia and Moravia as the first

point of the meteor's course ; and Prof, von Niessl himself, who saw the

meteor at Briinn, in Moravia, very favourably, was under no impression

whatever that an earlier portion (at least half) of its visible track had

Aescaped his view.  curious illusion also happened in his view of the end

point, which he believed to have taken place behind the roof of a house, but

which the calculated place shows must have been actually visible close above

it from his point of view, aud that the sudden extinction there must have

led him to believe that the end of the meteor's course was prolonged behind

the roof, and had been hidden from him by its neighbouring obstruction. It

is remarkable that but two or three observations of the meteor's early com-

--mencement at places as distant as Yienna, Schemnitz, and Bybnik from

--the neighbourhood of its terminal, streak-leaving course and explosion should

have been made among the many scores which were recorded of the latter

portion of its flight, while yet the brightness there, some hundred miles from

the point which it ultimately reached, was sufficient to make an observer

Aturn round and see it appearing from behind him.  streak was left on its

whole course ; but only for a few seconds, Baron von Pronay states, during

the first two thirds of its path across the sky.

Adopting, therefore, the Bybnik observation as perfectly confirmed, and

employing it with all the new materials at his disposal, Prof, von Niessl finds

his previous determinations, except in the least significant particular of the

total length of course, to require no sensible modifications, and to differ also

almost insensibly from those arrived at by Prof. Galle. The apparent radiant-

--point was at 248°-6, 20°-2, and the velocity found from the short streak-

bearing portion of the flight, of which several well accordant durations were

observed, was 19 miles per second, differing little from those found by Prof.

Galle, at 246°-7,-- 19°-3, and between 18-5 and 28-5 miles per second, ac-

cording to two estimates of the duration from which he separately deduced

the meteor's velocity in its entire length of flight. The radiant-point is so

near the ecliptic, that when corrected for ' zenithal attraction,' one of the

positions thus assigned to it is in north and the other in south latitude, so

that the meteor's orbit was almost absolutely zodiacal, dr nearly coincided

with the plane of the ecliptic. It is perhaps not impossible that the fireball

of July 25, 1876, observed in England with a nearly ecliptic radiant-point

at 258°, --24° may have had some connexion with the hvperbolic meteor

stream to which it appears that we must have recourse in order to explain,

with Professors Galle and von Niessl, the somewhat sensible excess of speed

above that in a parabolic orbit with which this great detonating meteor of

June 17, 1873, pursued its long and, it appears, very rapid flight over central

Europe.

 --1874, April 10, 7h 57 m p.m. (Prague mean time), Bohemia*. Several de-

scriptions of the appearance of this detonating meteor were published in

Bohemian newspapers, in Heis"s ' Wochenschrift fur Astronomie,' and in the

Proceedings of the Austrian Meteorological Society, while it was well observed

at Briinn ; and some private communications from other points, especially the
Royal Observatory at Prague, and a place near Kuttenberg, in Bohemia, near

which the final explosion took place, were received by Prof, von Niessl. It

strongly illuminated for two or three seconds the towns of Prague and Briinn,

and its flash resembled that of lightning in some of the towns of Silesia. At

Leipzig its apparent brightness was about that of the planet Venus ; but in

the immediate neighbourhood of its fall, where it burst nearly overhead, its

glare was like sunlight, and its terrifying flash was followed in about a minute

by a hollow peal of thunder, the echoes of which were endlessly reverberated

for nearly the space of a minute more. This was at Kuttenberg, where its

path among the stars was noted. Combined with the observations at Briinn

the point of extinction is found from this account to have been not far south-

westwards from Kuttenberg, 18J miles high over the village Majelovic, in
ABohemia.
           good position of the radiant-point is afforded by six astrono-

mically described tracks, at 26°, -f 62°, close to the star e Cassiopeiae, which

was then 33° above the N.W. by W. horizon. The point of first appearance

lay 52 miles along this course from the termination, at a height of 45 miles,

unless some imperfect indications of a greater initial height and length of

path than this can be trusted for its prolongation to an earlier point. The

average duration of this portion of its visible flight gives a velocity of 14

miles per second, while the velocity corresponding to a parabolic orbit with

the observed radiant-point is about 14-5 miles per second. Prof, von Niessl

is not, however, satisfied with this appearance of agreement, as some of the

observations of position render a rather greater length of path than that just

assigned for the average observed duration somewhat probable ; and he has
calculated a hyperbolic orbit of this detonating meteor, at the same time re-

peating his formerly expressed conviction that aerolites and detonating meteors

will be found to differ from ordinary periodic star showers and from the

great majority of comets by native velocities of motion in space carrying

them with independent speeds from the region of some distant star spheres

into the neighbourhood and the attraction of the solar system.

 --1876, April 9, 8 h 20 m (Vienna and Briinn mean time), Hungary and

Galiciaf- The scene of this meteor's explosion was the neighbourhood of

Rosenau, Eperies, and Iglo on the Hungarian flank of the Carpathian Moun-

followed by even more violent detonations than accompanied the descent of
Ili.it ponderous aerolite It shot from N.N.W. to S.S.E. over that district of
Hungary and Galicia, disappearing at a height of 20 miles over a point about
30 miles south of Iglo and Eperies. It presented the appearance of a bluish
ball of light as large as the moon, followed by a dense train of sparks and
ending with a great outburst of such corruscatious as were likened by some
to a tree top, and which produced a most intense illumination. Even at
Eriinn and in Vienna, where it was seen by Prof. Jelinek, its apparent
brilliancy was several times greater than that of Venus, and the duration of
its luminous course was variously estimated by different observers at between
three and eight seconds. For the position of the radinnt-point, seven re-
corded tracks could be compared together, which confirmed the conjecture,
already formed by Prof, von Niessl from the observation at Briinn, of its

probable situation in Cassiopeia, by indicating 17°, +57° as its true place

(within three or four degrees in right ascension and declination), at an alti-

tude of 23° above the N.W. by N. horizon, from which the meteor was
directed. The earliest point of observation of the meteor along this line was
obtained at Lemberg, when the fireball was still 200 miles from its point of
disappearance and its height above the earth's surface was 100 miles. Com-
paring the lengths of path and durations together which were observed at
Lemberg and seven other places, an average velocity of 25 - 5 miles per second

--is found, by giving equal weights to all the individual results a velocity

which, Prof, von Niessl again notices, considerably exceeds, as before, the
theoretical velocity (of 14'5 miles) in a parabolio orbit, and points to

hyperbolic elements being probably assignable also to this aerolitic fireball's

real orbit.

   With regard to the observed radiant-points of this fireball and of that of
April 10, 1874, a rediscussion of the observations of the latter, retaining some
previously rejected observations, enables him to present the following im-

partial comparison of all the observations available for their eomputatiou in

nearly the same hyperbolic orbit round the sun, becomes at once a very

probable and a new and remarkable conclusion from these very exact recent

observations*.

  A* case of probable coincidence of orbits of two aerolites is noticed by Prof. Kirkwood

in ' Nature,' vol. xiv. p. 526 (Oct. 12, 1876)-- those of Meno (Mecklenburg, 1861, October 1
12 h , noon), and one named by Dr. Lawrence Smith after its donor, Mr. Claywater, who
described its fall (in Vernon Co., Wisconsin, U.S., 1865, March 25, 9h a.m.), having been

recently shown by Dr. Lawrence Smith (Amer. Journ. of Science, September 1876) to be

almost identical in their composition, as if fragments of one and the same very unusually

constituted meteorite. Reckoned on the ecliptic the dates of their fall are 183° or 177°

apart in longitude, greatly favouring the supposition that in some conic section, the incli-

nation of whose plane to that of the ecliptic is not necessarily restricted, these two bodies

may have been pursuing one and the same astronomical orbit round the sun, whose perihe-

lion (if it exists) must evidently lie midway (in longitude 97° or 277°) between the two

points of the earth's encounter with the meteorites. Supposing, however, that no very

sensible inclination of the orbit plane to that of the ecliptic should exist, the condition

either of conjunction or of opposition (or of a six months' interval between the dates) of two
meteoric occurrences is not a necessary condition to their belonging to a common circum-

solar orbit ; and Prof. Kirkwood mentions the great similarity of composition between the

meteorites of Somer Co., U.S. (May 22, 1827), and Utrecht, Germany (June 2, 1843), re-

marked by Baumhauer, which, if these meteorites were pursuing the same orbit, would

oblige us to suppose it to have had two intersections with the earth's orbit very near to-

gether, and to have therefore had either no sensible or at least only a very small inclina-

tion to the ecliptic. As regards the probable inclination of the Meno-Wisconsin pair of

strongly resembling meteorites, a very simple consideration of the aspects of the horizon

with regard to the sun and to the apex of the earth's way at the times and places of the

two aerolitic falls (which were very analogous to each other at the two places) shows that

the perihelion of the common orbit (if it was nearly parabolic) must have had southern

latitude, lying somewhere on an arc included between long. 97°, S. lat. 5°, and long. 277°,
S. lat. 45°. If with this southern perihelion the descending node of the orbit was at Meno

(in ecliptic longitude 8°) and the ascending node was at Vernon Co. (in ecliptic longitude

185°), the meteorites' real courses must have been from a low altitude in the north or

north-west at Meno, and from a low altitude above the south to east horizon in Wisconsin.

If the reverse was the case, and (he ascending and descending nodes of the meteoritic

orbit were respectively at Meno and Vernon Co., the meteorites must have come from very

near the south- and north-western                                         horizons of      those two places                                                                                       but on  neither  of these

the wide limits of the requirements established by these astronomical conditions. These

are summed up in the following table of the orbit elements necessary to satisfy the known

circumstances of the aerolitic falls, and the elements of the comets of 1264 (and 1556),

which among several such apparent resemblances entirely fail of satisfying them, are

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                 149

 --187G, July 8, about 8h 45TM (Chicago moan time), Indiana and Michigan,

IT. S.* The course of this meteor was nearly from the westernmost point of

Lako Erio (beginning at a point 88 miles over Ottohee, Fulton County, Ohio,

30 miles west of Toledo on tbat lake) to the southern extremity of Lake

Michigan (ending 34 miles above a point about 35 milos from Chicago, and

25 miles from Michigan City, over the lake), traversing a distance of 1 4-5

miles over the line of junction between Michigan State and those of Ohio

and Indiana with sttrprising brilliancy. Of its real speed of motion the

observations of the duration of the meteor's flight unfortunately afford no

satisfactory determination. The direction of the flight was from 12° S. from

+E., alt. 21° [or from about the apparent radiant-point 305°, 7°, near the small

star k Aquilse], as deduced, with the other particulars of its real path, from

observations made at Bloomington and Paoli in the south, and at several

points in the north of Indiana State, as well as at Chicago. At the latter
place, " The meteor was a very brilliant one. It lighted up the sky like

the glare of the calcium-light, the intensity being several times greater

than the light of full moon." It did not seem to burst ; but its matter was

apparently exhausted in the latter part of its flight, leaving a luminous train

along its track, which remained visible at least 40 minutes. ISTo detonation

was heard, and if any stones were precipitated at the end of its flight these

would necessarily have fallen into the waters of Lake Michigan.

  A writer from Stratford, Connecticut, informed Prof. Kirkwood that at

nearly the same hour as that of this fireball's appearance, he noted a brilliant
meteor shoot from the northernmost visiblo star in Camelopardus, about 8°

from Polaris, and vanish immediately behind a projecting roof after lighting

up the eastern portico from which it was observed. Connecticut being far

cast of Lake Erie, this observation is irreconcilable with the course of the

above fireball, and it must without doubt be ascribed to a second large meteor

Aappearing almost simultaneously with the first.  largo meteor, very much

resembling that one above described, and like it leaving a very persistent

light-streak on its course, was seen on the 8th of July, 1856, in Alabama and

Mississippi f, and the occurrence of a stonefall in Spain, Prof. Kirkwood

remarks, has been recorded on the 8th of July, 181 1 ; but the absence of any
statements in the accounts of its appearance that sounds of an explosion were

noticed in connexion with the present fireball, makes it doubtful if with all

its brilliancy it may properly be regarded as having been an ae'rolitic me-

teor, or one projecting any solid residue of its substance from its track.

   1876, December 21, 8 h 43m p.m. (Bloomington mean time), Kansas to Penn-

to offer some agreement with the other conditions of the double stonefall. Although it

had a high altitude in its descending node, at Meno on October 1, the radiant-point of
the comet of a.d. 1264 was in fact 75° below the north horizon of Wisconsin, U.S., when
the aerolite fell there, owing to the apse or perihelion of this comet's orbit midway be-

tween its two nodal longitudes being at a considerable distance in latitude on the north
side of the. ecliptic. Even the comet of a.d. 178, which satisfies the conditions generally
more nearly than any other, has its perihelion in north latitude 18°, and its radiant-point
at the ascending inward-moving node was, for that reason, about 40° below the visible
horizon of Wisconsin when the aerolite fell there, as the position of the horizon precludes
the impact upon it of meteorites "ascending" and moving inn-arch in their orbits from

without.

--sylvauia aud to Western New York, U. S. A fireball of unprecedented

magnificence and length of course (not excluding even the great fireball seen
in England on the 18th of August, 1783), was extensively observed in the
northern part of the United States of America on the night of the 21st of

December last, of which some highly elaborate investigations have been made
and an unusual number of exceedingly extraordinary descriptions have been
published. The following particulars of its real path and appearance are
taken from two very complete discussions of the various accounts and state-
ments concerning it which had appeared, by Prof. H. A. Newton and Prof.

1877 (vol. xiii. pp. 166 and 207), and from a further review of its real

course by Prof. Kirkwood, contained in a paper (see the note appended to the
date and place of appearance of the last meteor) read before the American

   According to Prof. Newton the meteor first made its appearance at a height

of about 60 miles over the neighbourhood of Topeka, in Kansas, crossed the
Missouri and Mississippi rivers near the towns of Leavensworth and Hannibal
respectively, undergoing some explosions over the centre of Missouri State,
and breaking into several fragments over Illinois, soon after crossing the
Mississippi. The breaking-up continued while the meteor was crossing the
States of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and in fact it consisted at this time of
a large flock of from 20 to 100 brilliant balls chasing each other across the

sky ! How far it pursued its course over Pennsylvania into Western New

York is uncertain, as a cloudy state of the sky appears to have interfered
with its visibility in the latter State, and no accounts of its appearance

further east had been received. An appalling sound of an explosion reached

the earth in central Illinois, which was less distinct in the southern part of
the State, and was not audible at Chicago and St. Louis ; but detonations

were heard at Erie, and as -far east as Concord, in Pennsylvania. The
assigned durations of its flight varied from 15 seconds up to 3 minutes ; and
the speed with which it pursued its long nearly horizontal course above the
earth for a well-determined distance of nearly 1UU0 miles did not probably
much exceed 10 or 15 miles per second. Deducting a certain amount (for
the earth's gravitation) from the nearly horizontal altitude, 15° 8. from west,

from which its course was directed, the radiant-point freed from this zenithal
attraction was in the eastern or southern part of the constellation Capri-
cornus, a little south of the ecliptic, where no radiant-point of meteors at

the same time of the year appears to have been previously recorded.

   With many exact accounts from all points along its course from west to

east, Prof. Kirkwood has obtained yet more definite particulars of its real
path. Its first appearance, a little SJ3. of the zenith of Emporia in Kansas,
shows it to have begun its course in the S. W. corner of that (State at a height

which neighbouring observations make about 70 or 75 miles. When passing

the meridian of Bloomington its height, about over Rochester, was 38 miles,
and as seen from Wooster its height due north from that town over Lake
Erie must have been 29 miles. In its course over Pennsylvania Prof. Kirk-
wood conjectures from this that its height over that State cannot have much

exceeded between 25 and 30 miles ; and as after an explosion near the south-

western border of New York State it speedily became extinct, it appears

to be satisfactorily demonstrated that its real course as a fireball ceased here,

and that no particles of its mass can afterwards have escaped out of the

atmosphere, although only one small fragment, 12 oz. in weight, is known

Ato have fallen from the meteor.  farmer, 3 miles from Rochester (Indiana ),

heard this stony fragment fall in the snow (six inches deep), when he left his

house to ascertain the cause of the explosion. Returniug the next morning

to the spot, the meteorite was found close to the spot where it had first fallen

and rebounded. In structure it is pisolitic and friable, and from its com-

position Prof. Sheppard, to whom a portion of it was transmitted, concludes

that it resembles the meteorite of Pegu, which fell on December 27, 1857

(in two pieces about ten miles apart, as will be recollected from the accounts

and from the discussion of the occurrence of that stonefall which were pub-

lished by Prof. Maskelyne).

   The prodigious violence of the explosion may be gathered from the fact

that its sound and jar were heard and felt (and were by some attributed to

an earthquake) by hundreds in Monroe Co. round about Bloomington (Ind.),

at an interval of 15 minutes, as noted on a clock by one observer near

Bloomington, after the passage of the meteor. The corresponding distance,

accomplished with the ordinary speed of sound, is 185 miles, representing not

the nearest point, over Rochester and Wicamac, of the meteor's course, 135

miles from Bloomington, but a point over Peoria in Central Illinois, where

by far the greatest disruption of the meteor in its course must have taken place.

Speaking of the meteor's form after this disruption Prof. Kirkwood writes,

" When crossing Indiana [according to the exact descriptions at Blooming-

ton] the principal fireball was followed by a train or group of smaller meteors,

many of which were superior in apparent magnitude to Venus or Jupiter.

The breadth or apparent diameter of this cluster, as seen from Bloomington,

was 3 degrees, and its length at least 20 degrees. Its true diameter was

therefore five miles, and its length about forty miles. These smaller meteoi j

Awere chiefly the results of the explosion over Central Illinois.  final dis, ·

ruption occurred over Erie County, Pennsylvania, several minor explosions

having taken place during the passage over Indiana and Ohio."
--152 report 1877.

From the list of towns over "which its track appears to have been vertical,

Prof. Kirkwood concludes that its real courso was not a perfectly straight

line, and that a convexity towards the north (amounting perhaps to a more

or less abrupt deflection at the principal poiut of explosion) is indicated

by the observations near the beginning and near the termination and

along the intermediate portions of its track. With this exception, and that

the meteor's course approached the earth with a sensible downward inclina-

tion, there is no very material difference between the real courses assigned to

it independently by Prof. Newton and Prof. Kirkwood. The whole extent

of its prodigiously long flight, according to the latter, from the extreme boundary

of Kansas in the west to that of Pennsylvania in the east, was not less than

between 1000 and 1100 miles !

 -- AAccounts in the 'Indianopolis Journal' thus describe the meteor as seen in

Southern Indiana : " fireball surpassing the moon in apparent magnitude,

followed by a great number of smaller meteors, was seen in the northern

heavens, from about 10° above the W. by N. to 5° above the N.E. horizon.
Many of the meteors following in the train of the principal bolide were

larger than Yenus or Jupiter. No attempt was made to count them, but

Atheir number was certainly nearly one hundred.       remarkable feature of

the meteoric group was the slowness of its apparent motion ; while it was

variously estimated, most of tho observers think that its time of flight could

not have been less than threo minutes." An observer near Columbus, in

Southern Ohio, describes it as " a cluster or flock of meteors seemingly

huddled together, like a flock of wild geese, and moving with the same velo-

city and grace of regularity. The colour of their light was a yellowish red,

like red rocket-balls. There was no illumination-nimbus or train from them.

We saw it first in the west, and some of us only as it was slowly nearing the

earth and about crossing the railroad in the north."

Prom a place on the track, close beneath the point of the meteor's principal

outburst and disruption in mid-course, at Jacksonville, 111., the ' Philadelphia

Enquirer ' gives a description recording tho extreme brilliancy and the

startling appearance of tho meteor. No notice, however, occurs in this de-

scription of the violent explosion, whose sound is said to have been terrific

in some counties of Illinois adjoining that from which the writer dates his

graphic narrative of the splendid sight. Neither are any descriptive accounts at

places near the beginning and end points of its course given in the two memoirs

above quoted, which would be of special interest regarding the aspect of the

meteor in those parts of its course which were either at or close to the points

--of its first and last appearance.
   Jacksonville, 111., U. S. " On Thursday evening [Dec. 21, 1870] a beautiful

meteoric display was witnessed here about half-past eight o'clock. The

meteor first came in view away to tho west, and about 30° above the horizon.

It passed but a short distance north of the city, and was finally lost to sight

away to the eastward. When first seen it seemed a blazing burning ball,

nearly as large as the full moon, and appeared to bo moving directly towards

this city. As it swept along with its fiery tail, some 20° in length, and some

ten to twenty 1 dazing fragments following it [even before the great dismem-

berment over Peoria, soon afterwards], it presented a sight of surpassing

magnificence and beauty. When this great ball of fire reached a point con-

siderably north of east [about over Peoria, Central 111.], it burst into ten or

twelve fragments not unlike in appearance the bursting of a rocket, and these

fragments seemed finally to disappear in a bank of clouds which hung near

the eastern horizon. The meteor was of such surpassing brilliancy that the

distinguished at a distance in the streets almost as plainly as in daylight.

The light was such that it gave a subdued green colouring to the earth, trees,

buildings, and ever}' other object. From the time the meteor was first seen

in the west till it was lost sight of in the east, full twenty seconds must have

Aelapsed.  singular feature of the phenomenon was that, instead of passing

in its flight earthward, its path from west to east seemed in an exact hori-
zontal direction. Nothing of the kind of such grandeur, brilliancy, and

beauty was ever before witnessed here. It was also seen at Burlington,

Iowa, St. Louis (Mo.), Laurence (Kansas), and at several places in

Indiana."

    Regarding the explosions in the early and middle portion of its flight,
Prof. Kirk wood states that, " some observers in Missouri report an explosion

of the moteor when passing over the central part of the State. At Blooming-
ton, Indiana, Prof. H. B. Boisen, who saw the meteor when duo west, and

watched it till it disappeared near the eastern horizon, observed it separate

into several parts when nearly north-west, or in the direction of Peoria,

Illinois." In his estimation of the meteor's real velocity, although very
difficult to arrive at accurately, Prof. Kirkwood very nearly corroborates the
value given by Prof. Newton, and considers it to have been about 8 or 12

miles per second.
    Notices of other large meteors seen in the United States on January 23,

and February 8, 1877, contained in Professor Kirkwood's paper, will pre-

                     splendid meteor traversed the sky from a point about

midway between Orion's Belt and the Pleiades, to a point directly under the

moon and about 10° above the horizon. It was pure white and dazzling,

and lasted five seconds, emitting no sparks except at the moment of disap-

pearance. It was about half of the moon's apparent size at the time.

Tho long low flight of the meteor in the south at Bray near Dublin, and

at Lisburn" near Belfast, 90 miles north of Bray, below the equator, from a

little east of the south meridian to an altitude of only 5° or 10° in the south-

west (southwards from Saturn, and apparently just below the moon), indi-

cates evidently a very distant line of flight from these towns, which the ob-

servations there are not sufficiently exact to make it possible to assign pre-

cisely. But their combination with the recorded path at Walsall, near Bir-

mingham (descending in the S.W. by W. from about the moon's altitude), on

a course which the Wolverhampton account describes as " nearly perpen-

dicular " towards the horizon, presents a very fair accordance for the point

of commencement, and a good determination of tho radiant-point and of the

reiaaiuing portion of the meteor's flight to its termination, if* it is assumed

that the direction of its fall, so near the moon (which was then due S.W. at

Walsall, at an apparent altitude of between 30° and 35°), requires a small

westerly correction to about W.S.W., instead of descending in the S.W. by

W. as it was described. With this apparent course, or with a direction

about half a point more westerly at Walsall (which is adopted to diminish

the otherwise extravagant length of path and real height of the track found
by combination with the Irish observations), the meteor's real path was fiom
75 miles over the promontory of St. Ann's Head, Milford Haven, to a point
45 miles over the sea at the entrance of St. George's Channel, 130 miles due
south of Cape Clear in Ireland, describing thus from the coast of Wales a
course to the extreme west longitude of Ireland at about the distance from

the Irish coast, along its southern shores, of the Nymph Bank near the middle

of the channel. The length of path is about 230 miles, performed with a
speed of 35 miles per second (taking 6^ seconds as the mean observed dura-
tion at Bray and Wolverhampton), from a radiant-point between 130°, +25°
and 140°, +30°, which was then about 10° above the E.N.E. horizon at the
places over which the meteor passed. This position, between y Cancri and
k Leonis, slightly noticed by Mr. Denning (at c Cancri, see the first list of
comet- accordances, p. 167) in the beginning of last January, is new in that

month, although catalogues contain positions very closely adjacent to it in
the months of February and December. Tbe theoretical speed of a meteor
from this radiant-point, having a parabolic orbit, would be 23 miles per
second which would only be satisfied by the observations if the length and

real distance of the meteor's course from the observers' stations could be di-

minished by about one third, or if the observed time of duration of its flight

could be increased one half, from 6| to 10 seconds ; either of which assump-

tions it would not be difficult to reconcile with the scanty data afforded for

such determinations by the recorded particulars of this very brilliant and
lengthy fireball, seen over a large area of England and Ireland in the twilight

sky.

    1877, January 23, about 4h r.ai. (local time), Kentucky and Indiana,

tj g. The final explosion of this meteor took place over Harrison County,

and an aerolite reached the earth (see the last Appendix of this Report, p. 193)
nine miles north of Cynthiana, in Kentucky, U. S. The fireball was observed

simultaneously near Bloomington and near Greensburgh, 56 miles east from

Blooinington, in Indiana, but only the height at first appearance, which was

at least 70 miles, can be roughly assigned from the observed positions. Near
Bloomington its visible track was very nearly perpendicular to the earth's
surface descending from an altitude of 35° in the south-east to the horizon
of a hill-top, south-east of the observers, behind which it disappeared. In
Kenton County, Ky., a rumbling sound was heard as if coming from a point
hi»h in the heavens about S.S.E., resembling the discharge of numbers of
heavy ordnance blended together, which jarred the earth perceptibly and

made windows rattle.                                              meteor,

about half the apparent magnitude of the full moon, seen near Ellettsville,

in Monroe County (chief town, Bloomington), Indiana, U. S., passed a little

south of the zenith from south-east to a point 10° above the horizon, 30° or

35° south of west. The body of the meteor emitted numerous sparks in the

latter part of its track, and left a luminous streak on its course for seveial

seconds. No sound of an explosion was heard, but its light was so intense

that the observer's horse took fright at the sudden vividness of the flash.

--A1877, April 6, 9" 26TM p.m. (Greenwich time), Wicklow to Cork Harbour,
Ireland.  detonating fireball passed with great brilliancy south-westwards

over the southern part of Ireland, at about it o'clock, P.M. (Irish time), bursting

about 40 miles 8.W. from Cork Harbour over the open sea. A number of

published and other particular accounts of its appearance were collected to-

gether by Mr. Robert J. Lecky in the ' Observatory ' (vol. i. p. 52. May lt>77 I,
embracing chiefly a great many points of observation from Cork in the south

to Stranorlar in the extreme north of Ireland. Among the most exact

accounts were those furnished to him by Mr. R. H. Scott, Director of the

Meteorological Office of the Board of Trade, from St. Ann's Head* and

Roche's Point, two stations connected with the Meteorological Office, at Mil-

ford Haven and in Cork Harbour. The meteor's course was also approxi-

mately noted by the stars in Dublin, and at Shillelagh, County Wicklow.

It probably commenced its flight 80 or 90 miles over the neighbourhood

of the latter place, and proceeded on a south-west course nearly over the

mouth of Cork Harbour to a point about 12 miles south of Gaily Head, where

it burst with a violent explosion (probably at a height of about 20 miles

above the sea) heard in three minutes at Roche's Point, and in about five

minutes as estimated by observers in the City of Cork. The report was

double and so heavy there, and in Queenstown in the harbour, that the houses

were shaken, and the powder-mills at Ballincollig, four miles from Cork, were

thought to have exploded. It was heard at Waterford and Limerick, 80 or

90 miles from the meteor's point of disappearance. At St. Ann's Head, 150

miles from the same point, and about 100 miles from the nearest point of the

meteor's course, its light was equal to that of the full moon, and the body of

the meteor, three or four times the apparent size of Sirius, was extended be-

hind to a length equal to the distance between two stars in Orion's belt. It

shone with the intensity of the lime-light at Cork, especially at bursting, and

objects six miles off were lighted up brilliantly by the glare ; at Roche's
Point the body of the meteor appeared white, tinged outside with blue,
and throwing out jets of coloured light. At Clonmel (under the middle or

early part of its course) it was a light blue circular body of some appareut

width with, first, a body of crimson flame two or three times its width in
length, and then a long train of yellow light following it. At Shillelagh
(earlier along the track, where the apparent course was " from the east side
of Orion's shoulder to the west of Sirius "), it seemed to " break out again
and again, lighting up the country with successive flashes." At Dublin it

" fell from the direction of a Orionis, bursting in a shower of vivid sparks."
Coloured " stars " or fragments are described as falling from it at other sta-

   * It is difficult to reconcile a course beginning " a little west from Polaris " at St.
Ann's Head with an observer's view of the meteor between Collon and Drogheda (30
miles north from Dublin), " descending slowly (from an altitude of about 50° in the
S.S.W.) with a very slight, inclination towards the east" (which substantiates perfectly
the recorded paths at Dublin and Shillelagh), without assigning an improbable height to

the meteor at its commencement. But though the entire course may have had a some-
what more north-west position (laterally shifted about l!l) miles) over the southern part

oi' Ireland (as from Portarlington to Cape Clear) than that above assigned to it. yet the
slope and the height and direction of the meteor's real path cannot have differed materi-
ally from that here described. The length of the path was about 185 miles, and the time
of describing it was reckoned at Shillelagh, Thomastown, and Collon, as " three or four,"
" four to six," and " quite seven or eight seconds." The meteor's velocity with an average
of these durations was ol miles per second, and the theoretical velocity, with a parabolic
orbit, of a meteor with the above assigned radiant-point is between 21 and 25 miles per

econd.

red and globe-like and very brilliant, from behind a clond to the horizon,

considerable flash which must have accompanied the terminal disruption).

cannot have lain southward of the latter place ; and if " near the pole star,"

at first, at St. Ann's Head, it must have then had an elevation of not less

than 80 miles. With a south-west flight from this point to a height of 20

miles at disappearance 40 miles S.W. from Cork, a radiant-point of its real

+course at 275°, 50° is obtained. Although this is suspiciously near the

radiant-point of the Lyrids of April 20 (at 270°, -f 35°), the course can-
not be adjusted to this point without making it very nearly horizontal, a

direction of flight which is not at all borne out by the observations ; and

there is no reason for supposing that this large detonating meteor (even if,

like the Lyrids of the brighter class, it had left a long-enduring light-streak)

was connected with the cometary or with any tributary system of the

Lyrid meteor-stream. Greg's shower ' Draconids I.,' at 267°, +53°, in

March and April, also noted by Schiaparelli on April 1 and 14, is the

nearest recognized general meteor-system of which this fine detonating

fireball may not improbably have been a member.

hibiting two bright flashes of intense light, descended over the eastern part

of Yorkshire, and was visible in many parts of England. Besides the notes

of its visible path included in the above fireball-list, the following description

of its appearance at Chipstead, Surrey, where its course was well seen, was

obligingly communicated to the Committee by Mr. 11. H. Scott. The ob-

server, who had seen many meteoric phenomena at sea, had never before

witnessed one of such great brilliancy. " The light was so strong, that I

could have seen a pin upon the doorstep where 1 stood "; and it cast this il-

lumination over the surrounding country. It appeared in the north-west as

a bluish-white fireball falling towards the east, and leaving behind it a long

train of sparks. The words italicized corroborate the description at Leicester

that it descended in the north (from y Cephei) on a course inclining east-

wards about 30° from vertical towards the right ; and from the accordant

appearance which its course presented in the north at these two places, the

same must also have been about the slope or direction in which it "dropped"

(probably at the end of its flight) " from Cassiopeia " above the northern

horizon at Cambridge. The direction of its explosion within a point of

Conister from the junction of Christian lload and Bucks Koad, as seen at

Douglas in the Isle of Man, indicates about the neighbourhood of Hull as

its  locality in  the  north  from   Chipstead,    Leicester,  and  Cambridge                                                           but

whether it appeared to descend vertically, or with a horizontal or inclined

motion at Douglas was not recorded ; and no intelligible agreement of its

apparent  course  and  position  as  observed  at    T  ewcastle-upon-Tync  with  those

described at Douglas and at the southern points of view can be extracted

from the note of its appearance there, for further determining the height in

miles and the position and direction of the meteor's real course. Its radiant-

point may be presumed to have been near 6, t, k Ursee Majoris (20° or 30°

west of the zenith), and its real path descending from a height of about 60

miles between Leeds and Hull to a height of 30 miles over the sea near the

neighbouring coast of Yorkshire, between Flamborough Head and (he Humbcr

but in the absence of good observations of the meteor from that neighbour-

hood, or from more northern points of view, no exact or positive conclusions

of the real direction and position of its visible flight over the comities of the

                                        III. Meteoric Showers.

   The moderate intensity of the display of Perse'ids on the 9th-l 1th of August,
1870, was noticed in the last lleport. The descriptions of the shower by English
observers, which tho Committee has received, generally confirm this, although
the light of the moon on the 9th, 10th, and 11th concealed many small
meteors, and the sky was hazy or partially cloudy at many of the stations.

Among the lists of tracks recorded under the most favourable conditions, tho

following table shows the hourly numbers of conformable and unconformable
meteors, respectively, mapped on the principal nights of the shower, together
with the percentage numbers of meteors exceeding the first and second mag-
nitudes of the fixed stars, respectively, in brightness which were recorded on

the successive nights.

    Though the moon's light interfered, yet as it was in its third quarter on the
12th, and as in two hours after midnight on the night of the 11th there were
seen at the Radcliffe Observatory, Oxford, 3 fourth mag., 29 third mag., 13
second mag., and only one meteor as bright as a first magnitude star, when
the moon was at its brightest, it is evident by comparing this residt with the
much larger proportion of bright meteors seen on the previous nights, that the
most brilliant meteors of the shower were considerably more abundant on the
nights of the 9th and 10th than on the 11th. The observations, even where long
continued, elsewhere agree with each other very imperfectly in this respect; but

they combine to show that the hourly numbers of the Perse'i'ds, especially as
compared with the unconformable meteors visible at the same time, was below
the average of what is ordinarily observed. Mr. Backhouse states that, making

all allowances for haze and moonlight, the display was by no means equal to

that of August 1875 ; and Mr. Wood, who has watched the appearance of the

shower annually for fifteen years, regarded it as decidedly the most meagre

and insignificant of all its exhibitions that he has witnessed in that time.

In the above analysis of the observations, the shooting-stars counted as

" Perse'i'ds" include meteors from several centres, apparently subordinate to

the main stream, but associated with it, of which Mr. Clark gives the follow-

ing positions, rj, ^, and n Persei, and t and y Cassiopeise ; the last of these
points he regarded as distinctly marked at 10°, +59°-5 on the 10th, and

somewhat more diffusely near the same place on the 14th.

An abstract of the radiant-centres, which he obtained from 88 meteor-tracks,

recorded between July 16th and 25th at Bristol (chiefly in the two hours

preceding midnight), is recorded by Mr. Denning in the ' English Mechanic

of Aug. 4th, 1876, (vol. xxiii. p. 536) in which this radiant in Cassiopeia

was shown to be very active towards the end of July*. Fifty-five of the
meteor-tracks observed diverged from the following radiant-points. The

Cassiopeiads were a marked shower of often very fine meteors, with long

courses and trains.                                                                                                                /"Schmidt, 6° +59°,

centred radiant-points, 9 more of these tracks were assigned by Mr. Denning
to the meteor-shower in Cassiopeia, 7 more were assigned to o Draconis, 6
more to ft Cephei, and two new meteor-tracks to the radiant-point uear H

Pegasi, a and ft Andromeda?, Honores or Lacerta, a Lyra?, a Cygni, and I
Ursa Majoris some accurately diverging tracks afforded fairly exact positions
of August meteor-showers. Clouds prevented observations between July 26th
and Aug. 4th, and meteors were remarkably scarce on July 20th and 25th, and
(as regards the Perse'i'ds) also between 10h and ll h p.m. on Angnst 11th, when
the Cassiopeia shower prevailed, which it did also (with Cephei'ds) very abun-
dantly on July 24th. The latter shower was most marked on July 19th, and
it was pretty plentiful, accompanied by radiants in Draco and Honores or

   * The principal radiant between August 5th and 11th, Mr. Denning found, from 37
Persei'd tracks selected for their accuracy, to be at 43°, +59°, with very little indication
of subradiants, unless one of a few meteors from 50°, +59°, (B Camelopardi), and
another of less frequent tracks from ^ Persei, may have been separately active.

five meteors from other radiant-points in three quarters of an hour ; on the
16th, Mr. Clark saw 3 Draconids in half an hour, and Mr. Denning noted two

Perseids between 10 h and ll h p.m.

Resuming observations during the same periods in the present year, Mr.

Denning noted numerous meteors in July and August, 1877 (' Nature ' July

27th and Aug. 9th, 1877, vol. xvi. pp. 286, 362), with a similar but more

complete list of the radiant-points which were most conspicuous in the middle

of July                                and among them  certain radiants                                                                                                                                                           in                                          Cassiopeia  and Perseus                 were  very

active. These latter correspond approximately in epoch and position to the

theoretical radiant-points of the comets of a.d. 770 and 1764, and they ap-

pear to be distinct from the true Terseus shower, the first member of which,

Mr. Denning states, was not visible until the morning of July 29th, nor any

perceptible abundance of them until the 5th of August. During the later

period of the first ten days of August, 1877, Mr. Denning recorded 229 meteors

unconformable to Perseus, among which a radiant in Cassiopeia was again an

active and conspicuous centre of divergence. It thus becomes important to

trace in future the exact places and durations of these Cassiopeiad showers,

and to fix their dates of maximum abundance, so as to distinguish them com-

pletely from the Persei'd shower with which they have probably been confused,

and from whose diffuse region of scattered radiation it will perhaps be possible

hereafter to separate their meteors.

   Between the 9th and 12th of August, 1876, there were mapped 115 meteor-
tracks (by Messrs. Backhouse, Clark, Denning, Herschel, Lucas, and Wood)
unconformable to the Perseus radiant region, a preliminary reduction of which

was made to assign their radiant-points. No less than seventeen distinct

centres of divergence are recognizable in the collection, only the numbers of
the meteor-tracks belonging to whose different systems can here be recorded, as
they are in general too few to allow positions of any important accuracy to
be derived from them ; and further corroborations of these meteor-systems
contemporaneous with the Perseus shower will be required to define their real
centres with precision.

   Letter from Mr. AVm. Crompton, communicated to Mr. Glaisher by Mr. J.

Crompton, Bracondale, Norwich.

   The time of this shower corresponds to about Aug. 13th, 10h a.m., mean

time at Greenwich. The shower cannot have been a branch stream of the

August Persei'd-showcr, as the radiant-point of that shower near n Persei' was

35 degrees below the N.E. horizon at New Plymouth at the time of the oc-

currence. The stars e Pegasi and a, ft Aquarii were about 20° or 30° above

the N.E. and E.N.E. horizon when the phenomenon was observed, and it may

have been from these constellations that a flight of more numerous and fre-

--cpient meteors than usual was directed.
   1876, Aug. 23rd. Mr. T. W. Backhouse observed several shooting-stars

on this night. Out of 15 tracks mapped, 4 and perhaps 7 appeared to be

Persei'ds ; some others were swift meteors, and they probably belonged to the

radiant No. 78 in Greg's list, 1874.
--A1876, Sept. 21st.
                      good centre of radiation of several extremely small

meteors was noticed by Mr. H. Corder, at Writtlo in Esses, on this night, at

352°-5,-r-16°-5, in Pegasus; and it was the most conspicuous centre of di-

vergence of ordinary meteors which he noticed during August, September,

and October. The following list includes all the results of his observations

for some months up to the latter date *.

the 21st; ten of the smallest meteors on this date); near Polaris (near the

--end of the month).
   "Radiants in October. Near Polaris (nearly every night to about the

18th).  Near ft Tauri, or  a  little  south  of (13th    and  16th), rather  large

orange meteors with trains and long courses. Numbers of small meteors from

Aries, Musca, Triangulum, and Lacerta, those from Aries generally getting

brighter. Cassiopeia (14th-18th), nearly all 3rd and 4th magnitude, with

short courses near the radiant ; very white, frequently brightening ; a very

distinct family. The end of the month quite overcast.

        On September 21st, in 2£ hours, 43 meteors ; 12 to 30 per hour.

        On October 14th, in 2^ hours, 36 ,,   16 per hour.

        October 13th-18th (inclusive) 106 ,,  about 9 per hour.

  A* brief account of these observations was given by Mr. Corder in the 'Astronomical

Register ' (November 1876). Mr. Denning was noting meteors on the night of September
21st, somewhat earlier than the hour (from 8' 1 15 m to ll h p.m.) of Mr. Corder's watch,
when small meteors were plentiful at Writtle, and he recorded them as rare on that night
during the hour when he observed. The marked prc\ alence of small meteors from Pegasus
must therefore either have been local, or have presented itself later on that night than
during the period of Mr. Denning's watch.

                 OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.               1GI

  --187G, October 18th-21st. The only observation which appears to indicate

a return of the Orionids of October, on the annual dates of the 18th-21st,

was recordod by Professor Kirkwood, in the following paragraph in the ' New
York Tribune ' of October 27th, 1876 :--

   " Shooting-stars in unusual abundance, as I am informed by trustworthy

witnesses, were observed at this place last evening (October 18th) from 6h
45 m to 9 b . The meteors appeared to radiate from Auriga, or rather from a

point between Taurus and Auriga. No count was kept, but the numbers

were such as to attract the attention of several persons in the street. Most
of the meteors were small, though two were observed of extreme brilliancy."
Professor Kirkwood adds that in consequence of a meteor-shower of this epoch
having been recorded * in 1436, 1439, 1743, and 1798, returns of which were
observed in 1838 and 1841, a strict watch should be kept on the annual date

of the present meteor display for any future apparitions of the shower that

may hereafter be observed.

chusetts^ U. S. ; « New York Observer,' November 9th, 1876 (see the list of

--fireballs in this Report, p. 110, for the description of a large meteor which it

records). "A meteor of remarkable size and brilliancy passed from the zenith

to the south-west, at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 19th [of October, 1876],
leaving a train which remained visible over a quarter of an hour. While the
train was being observed, a large number of smaller meteors passed, as often
as one a minute, over the same field [from Taurus towards the south-west],
one or two of them leaving a slight train." The time of occurrence of this
meteor-shower would be five or six hours later, in local time at Greenwich,
its commencement accordingly occurring in England at about midnight on

the night of the 18th of October, when no observers of shooting-stars in
England were upon the watch.

   At Bristol Mr. Denning's nightly registers of meteors were pursued in

October, chiefly in the early hours of the evening, with the following

results :

(three of them small and short near the radiant-point), leaving white streaks

constant rainfall interrupted meteor observations almost completely on the

ten preceding days, and it is not possible to say if this observation indicated

a later recurrence of the Leonids in 1876 than was ever discovered previously

Aamong the latterly diminishing evidences of their annual displays.  fine

" Leonid-like " meteor, seen by Mr. Backhouse on Nov. 11th (see the fireball

list), may not impossibly have belonged to a different meteor-system (in Leo

Minor) of which Mr. Denning found, last November, many members leaving

streaks, and of great swiftness, abundant in the later days of the month*.

Of the ' Andromede ' star-shower of November 27th no recognizable meteor

representatives were observed.

Mr. Denning and Mr. Corder were again successful during the month of

November in securing a great number of observed meteor-paths, and in de-

ducing from them their radiant-points. Up to this time 1300 meteors (in-

cluding Perseids) had been registered by Mr. Denning, and his revised list of 52

radiant-points, deduced from 740 ordinary shooting-stars and 560 Perseids,

was communicated to the ' Astronomischo Nachrichten ' at the end of October,

where it formed an extension of a shorter list of 27 radiant- points commu-

nicated in April of the same year to the Royal Astronomical Society, and

already included in the ' Monthly Notices ' of the Society for April, 1876

(vol. xxxvi. p. 284). During November and following months of the past

year Mr. Denning's observations were resumed more often and systematically

than before, and were continued chiefly in the morning hours of the night,

after moouset, when few observations of shooting- stars had hitherto been

collected. The Journal of his observations contained at this time 464 meteor-

tracks, recorded since January 1876, and by its comparison with that kept at

the Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford, and with other lists furnished to them by

observers during the same time, the Committee was able to trace among

these records fifteen or twenty simultaneous observations of ordinary shooting-

stars, particulars of whose appearance have been given in a foregoing list

(p. 126). The advantago, in frequency, of the meteors observable in the morn-

ing hours over their rate of visibility before midnight was soon found by Mr.

Denning to be very sensible. Thus in 23 hours of observation (nearly all p.m.)

between October 13th and 29th, 1876, 155 meteors were mapped, while 212

were registered in 25| hours (both a.m. and p.m.) in November ; of these latter

   * The two meteors simultaneously observed at Stonyhurst and at the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich, on the morning of Nov. 15th, 1875 (see the list of shooting-stars doubly ob-

served, above, p. 126), one of which appeared stationary, at the latter place, at 158°, +40°,
and of which the other had a radiant-point at 154°, +37°, seem both to hare been early

representatives of the same shower in Leo Minor, whose radiant-point on Nov. 26-29 Mr.

Denning found to be at 155°, +36°.-- [On the nights of Nov. 5 and 7, 1875, Mr. Backhouse

saw 14 meteors in about an hour of cloudless watch, chiefly directed from the radiant

Rpoint 4 ; and one or two meteors, apparently ' Andromedes,' in 20 minutes' watch on the

night of Nov. 28th. (Note omitted from last year's Report.)]

 79 wore seen in 13g hours before midnight, and 133, or nearly double the
 number, in 12 hours of observation after midnight. Since November last
 Mr. Denning has continued his early morning observations of shooting-stars

 at Bristol, whenever the absence of the moon and of overcast and tempestuous
 Weather, which were especially prevalent during manymonths at the beginning

 of this year, would permit him to persue them with success.
    The best-known meteor-shower in November, to which Mr. Denning's and

 Mr. Corder's attention was specially directed by the abundance and by the
 large size and brightness of its meteors, was that of the ' Taurids,' of whose

epoch and radiant-point, in the early part of November, many very accordant

 accounts have already been given in different observers' catalogues of meteor-

showers. Two or three different centres of divergence of these meteors,

besidos the double focus principally assigned to them (at 51°, +13°, and 56°,
 +21°, in the early part of November) in Captain Tupman's list, appear to

exist simultaneosly with this; and the result of Mr. Corder's and Mr.
Denning's observations is to trace the continuation of a shower, with nearly

this general region of divergence, for several weeks in October and November,

presenting various dates of maxima and subordinate radiant-points belonging

apparently to its group, followed by another shower of Taurids towards
December, the position of whose radiant-point is sensibly different from that

of the already known Taurids of the first few weeks in November. The
earliest symptoms of the return of these closely allied Taurid showers wore

noticed on tho 13th and 16th of October, by Mr. Corder, producing fine

orange-coloured meteors from the direction of ft Tauri (79°, +28°; Mr.
Denning's position for October 21-29 was at 61°, +18°). Between the 7th
and 16th of November the position of the radiant-point appeared to Mr.

Corder to lie sometimes on the S.W. and sometimes on the N.E. side of
the Pleiades, between the usually assigned position (52°, +22°, from 19
meteors between November 7th and 10th) and a point near Tauri (at

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \f,

showing an apparent tendency of the radiant-point to advance in right as-

cension towards the middle of the month, without at the same time ever
departing very far from the position which it occupies in the early days of
November. Kadiants of five or six meteors each were also noted near Persei

                                                                                                                                                                                                 ft

(44°, +37°), x Andromedae (24°, +43°, one at least of which seemed to be a
member of the Bielan comet shower), and a Auriga? (75°, +45°), which are

distinct, but not always very easily distinguished meteor-systems, from the
Taurus shower.

   Besides the position already noticed in October, Mr. Denning found the

position of the ' Taurid ' radiant-point, from 19 meteors recorded in November,

+to be at 58°, +16°, and 62°, 22°-5. Seven of these meteors (from the first

point) were seen on the morning of the 8th, and nine meteors (from the
second point) on the morning of the 20th of November. They formed an ex-
ceedingly fine shower on the latter morning, and the position of the radiant-
point on that morning was obtained with unusual exactness. Mr. Denning
regards the three positions which he observed from October 21st to the end of

+November as all belonging to a continuous shower (at 60°, 19°), which, in
                                                                         m2

distinction from later showers in the same vicinity, he has designated

" Taurids I." The immediately following shower-system, " Taurids II.," with

+ +a radiant-point near (3, f Tauri (78°, 25° Corder, and 80°, 23° Denning,

from Nov. 22 to Dec. 14), he regards as distinct from a continuation (at 57°,

+ 26°) of the e or rj and \p Tauri shower of November, which he observed in

sparing activity from November 28th to December 24th, and which he identi-

AGfies, under the title " Taurids III.," with the long-enduring shower  t  in Greg's

+list, at 60°, 20°, lasting from Dec. 21st(?) to Feb. 6th. The new shower near

/3, £ Tauri presented a very decided maximum, nearly half of all the meteors

seen in a watch of 3± hours proceeding from it, with a well-marked radiant-

point on the morning of December 6th, while few symptoms of this new

Taurid shower remained in activity after the morning of December 8th.

   Among other conspicuous new showers detected by Mr. Denning in No-

vember and December 1876 (some of the chief of which he noticed and de-

scribed in letters in ' Nature,' vol xv. pp. 158, 217) a very important one,

+situated in Leo Minor, at 155°, 36°, was remarkably fine and abundant

on the mornings of November 26th to 29th, furnishing (about equally in thoso

successive nights) nineteen meteors with a very exactly denned centre of di-

vergence. It appears not to have been quite unnoticed in the earlier radiant

lists of other observers on dates extending from November 7th to December

9th              but the present date and position agree, much better than any previously
              ;

assigned to it, with the time and direction of the earth's nodal conjunction,

with a meteor-stream following the orbit of the comet 1798 II. at its de-

scending node (Dec. 2, 162°, +34°) ; and it may be added that the brightness
of the " Taurid I." shower on the morning of November 20th, at 62°, +22°, is

also in much better agreement as to date than any earlier observations had

been, with a pretty close appulse to the earth's orbit of the comet of 1702,

about the 27th of November, with a radiant-point at 56°, +20°. The Leo-

Minorids arc swift white meteors, leaving very bright, persistent streaks, and

presenting a great resemblance to the Leonids, with which, perhaps, some

bolides of its stream, visible before the hour when Leo rises on the east horizon,
may have been occasionally confused (see a note, ante, p. 162, of some meteors,

apparently of this shower, visible on the morning of November 15th, 1875).

    Several other cometary radiant-point positions were remarkably identified
with recorded star-shower centres during Mr. Denning's observations in

November and December, 1876, the principal of which may be here briefly

noticed. To make the list of observed meteor-showers presenting analogies

with cometary orbits, as indicated by Mr. Denning's recent observations,

complete, some examples of such coincidences in September and October and

in January and February, as well as the more frequent accordances which

were noted in November and December last, are included in the Table (p. 166).
The present list of twenty such compai'isons would be much increased if those

obtained during later months, when (the overcast state of the sky preventing

regular observations) Mr. Denning's investigations were chiefly confined to

a systematic examination of the long lists of meteor-tracks in printed and
MS. catalogues which the Committee has during the past few years received
from observers in Austria, Hungary, and Italy *, could be regarded as of the

   * The Catalogue of shooting stars observed by the Italian Luminous-Meteor Association

(see these Keports for 1872, p. 108) in 1872, containing about 7000 meteor-tracks, including

Perseids, was, a few years since, presented to tbe Committee, and a still larger catalogue of
about 12,000 shooting-star observations, made in later years by the same Association, has
quite recently been presented to Mr. Denning by Professor Scbiaparelli. Professor Weiss,
of the Imperial Observatory of Tienna, transmitted to the Committee, during the past
year and in 1874 (see these Reports for 1874, p. 344), two volumes of observations of

same original importance, and were to be comprised in tlic same Table with

Ahis own independently observed determinations.  separate table (p. 1G8) of

eleven such comparisons is annexed; and from the care bestowed upon its re-

duction and verification, a very important one is besides included in the previous

table, presenting a very close analogy with the orbit of Donati's comet, near

tho date of the earth's nodal conjunction with it on September 8th. It is

scarcely possible to say exactly what importance may really be attached to

such apparent accordances of meteor-showers with comets, whose recorded

paths are in general very far from even nearly intersecting the earth's orbit

where they pass nearest to it ; but many such cases of exact accordance in

time and position of the radiant-points of some meteor-showers with those

of comets whose orbits are far removed from proximity to the earth's orbit

have now been detected. One of the most memorable and at the same time

extreme instances of such defective correspondences is afforded by the coin-

cidence first noticed by Schiaparelli (and here reproduced in the second

list of Mr. Denning's accordances), where the perfect parallelism of the

' Coronids ' (of about April 11th) with the distant orbit of the great comet of

1847 must, in spite of the excellent agreement between them, be ascribed to

accident, unless very bold hypotheses of the mode of derivation of meteor-

streams from comets may be adopted to explain it ; for the nucleus of the

comet in its node and perihelion almost grazed the body of the sun, and only

the lengthy tail which it swept or wheeled round with it can be supposed to

have reached and even to have extended far beyond the orbit of the earth !

What quantity of matter, visible and invisible, may be thrown off from comets

by the cloud-jets which appear to be projected from them on all sides during

their circumsolar passages, and what forms and varieties of meteor-streams

this matter and that projected in the tail may possibly produce, associated

with large comets, remains a reasonable subject for conjecture ; and no im-

possibility exists that feeble streams, allied in their radiant-points to such

large comets as Donati's and the first comet of 1847, and perhaps to all tho

ancient comets and to those recent ones which have been more or less plainly

visible to the naked eye, may be occasionally detected by observers. It is in

fact remarkable that among the plentiful instances of good agreement which

might now be enumerated, at least one half (as will be seen by consulting

the above two lists) are partial or defective by the remoteness of the comet's

orbit, and not nearly so many can be ranked and regarded as unexceptional

by the closeness of the conjunction or by the practically direct intersection

of the comet's orbit with the orbit of the earth. The new-found accordances,

and those which aro now established much more closely than before by Mr.

Denning's recent observations and reductions, are marked with an asterisk (*)

in the lists ; and fifteen out of seventy good resemblances (which the total

number of approximate cometary coincidences has now reached) have either

been brought to light or are raised to a position of considerable certainty, for

such determinations, by the close watch and well-directed labour of a few

months of meteor-mapping with which Mr. Denning has (prompted by no other

shooting stars made in Austria, under his directions, during the years 1867-70 and 1871-
74 ; tho first, of these volumes contains 319G and the second 3039 observations, in which
are included some lists and accounts at the Bielan shower of November 1872, and 'many

observations at Herr von Konkoly's observatory at Ogyalla, in Hungary, to whom the

Committee is also indebted for a list of meteor-tracks recorded there during the years
1872-73. Besides these lists, Mr. Denning examined and projected the unreduced meteor-
tracks contained in Captain Tupman's Catalogue, and the long lists recorded at the Ead-
cliffe Observatory, Oxford, and, during the year 1869, by Padre Denza, at the Observatory

of Moncalieri, near Turin.

succour and incentive than that of his own unfailing ardour in these investiga-
tions) succeeded in surpassing, during the past year, in his own catalogue

of meteor-showers the number which any single observer has before been able

to chronicle in a protracted time of many successive years of observation.

(Sufficient illustrations to describe in full the particulars of the meteor-showers

which he observed, and the characters of their appearance, in which he was con-

firmed by Mr. Corder's simultaneous observations, and by tho reductions

which he contemporaneously made of foreign observers' catalogues, cannot

without the aid of tables be presented for discussion in the concise form which

the limits of space assigned to this Report require. Comparative Tables of the

new meteor-showers and radiant-points, showing the values attached to the

observations and the extent to which they agree among themselves and

extend or assimilate with earlier determinations, have been arranged and

compiled by Mr. Greg, and will be found at the end of this appendix.

Speaking of his observations in October last, when the 1300 meteor-tracks

from which his last published list of 52 radiant-points was constructed were

all recorded, Mr. Denning wrote, " I found meteors rather frequent between

the 13th and 29th of October. Altogether I watched 23 hours (chiefly before

midnight) and saw 155 meteors, of which I recorded 122. Subtracting 2

hours of moonlight (when only 4 meteors were mapped), and deducting one

sixth from tho time of the watch, during which my attention was engaged in

mapping, temporary absence, &c, we get an average horary number of 8-6

meteors for October 13th to 29th (p.m.), 1876 ; but I hardly think meteors

during this period were more frequent than during the latter half of July,

when Cassiopeiads, Draconids, &c. were very active.
   " Confirming a remark which was made some time ago, that the luminous

streak of a meteor will occasionally brighten visibly after the actual extinc-

tion of the nucleus, I noticed an instance of the kind quite recently. I was

looking towards Orion, and had just glimpsed a very faint meteor, almost

doubting whether or no it was one at all. While hesitating about it, I kept

my eye directed to the same spot, and there, two or three seconds later on,

a small train came out very plainly, and enabled me to mark the path of this

well-nigh unseen shooting-star most accurately." At 10h 52m p.m. on the

12th of August, during the Persei'd shower in 1876, Mr. Clark also noticed a

nearly stationary Persei'd, as bright as a star of the second magnitude, at

+323-5, 58°-7, with a course scarcely longer than |°, which was visible for |

of a second, and its streak for two and a half seconds afterwards, very brightly.

This shooting-star, Mr. Clark wrote, " looked almost like a double meteor, its

streak flared up so brightly." The Orionids (of which the meteor seen by

Mr. Denning was probably one) are even more remarkable than the Persei'ds

or the Leonids for the breadth or volume and for the brightness of the per-

sistent light-streaks which mark their tracks, and the long-enduring or even

rekindling lines of light that remain on the tracks of the meteors of these

showers indicate their extreme velocity, due to the close proximity of their

Aradiant-points to tho apex of the earth's way.  sign so certain of this pecu-

liar situation or proximity to a well-known point in the sky of a meteor's

radiant-point is of such essential value in assigning to individual shooting-

stars the probable shower-centres from which they emanate, that no ambiguous

words should be used, if possible, to describe it ; and in recording any luminous

appearance, continuous or interrupted, visible in a meteor's wake, observers

would do well to reflect and to state in as unambiguous terms as possible if it
presented that appearance of rightly-named " phosphorescence" which is so

easily recognized and distinguished by the peculiar property of rekindling
                                                                                                                                                 --

which it always possesses more or less strongly, as described above in Mr.
Clark's and Mr. Denning's observations. While the words " train " or " tail,"
used to denote " something bright " in a meteor's wake distinct from the head,

are perfectly ambiguous (since they would equally be used to denote sparks

and flakes or detached embers of every kind which meteors leave or draw

after them along their course), the word " streak," implying the mark im-

pressed or impiiuted by the meteor upon the air when its velocity and heat

are great enough to make this visible, is incapable by its ordinary signification

of being applied to fragments of the meteor itself, such as constitute the great

variety of glowing products or residues which are often observable during

the process of a good many meteors' deflagrations ; but in its proper meaning
of a mark made or left by a meteor upon the atmosphere, it probably ex-

presses the real origin of the above-described vapours or cloud-like evolutions

of light sometimes produced along a meteor's track. Such streaks (as they

should be called) are not always white, nor oven, when very permanent, of

unchanging colours                                                                                                    for those of the Perseids  are sometimes orange-yellow,
                                                                                                                   ;

and those of the Leonids bright green, changing when long-enduring to white

and yellow, and even occasionally to dull red beforo they fade away ; and in

their spectra the lines of incandescent magnesium-vapour have been found to

be visible up to the extinction of a streak for noarly a quarter of an hour,

showing that they are composed of some self-luminous gases in whose light

it is believed that the lines of several metallic vapours have been observod.

The words " streak " and " no streak," denoting whether a meteor left or

did not produce a hue of phosphorescence or of kindling and ignited gases

along its line of flight, should not be omitted in recording the appearance
of even very faint and inconspicuous shooting-stars ; while the words " traiu "

and "tail," or " track of sparks," &c, should never be employed to denote

it even it' its brightness is very marked, but should be used exclusively to

describe those luminous appearances in a meteor's flight which evidently

proceed from more or less pulverized solid portions of the meteor's substance

separated from it in its flight, and which, however luminous at first, in general

soon become extinguished.

  A very complete review of his observations in November and December,

1876, was given by Mr. Denning in the ' Astronomical Register ' of Dec.

1876 (p. 296) and January 1877 (p. 18), to the very carefully compiled
results of which sufficient reference will here be made by this allusion.

Besides about 30 meteors mapped from September 10th to 20th (which

gave nearly the same radiant-points as the October tracks), 122 meteors were

mapped from October 13th to 29th, and 183 meteors from November 8th to

30th ; the former group presented 16, and the latter 18 meteor-showers. As
a class they were small, and mostly white and swift, the magnitudes of 306

which were registered between October 13th and November 28th being thus

distributed, beginning with those equal to or exceeding stars of the first

magnitude in brightness, and reckoning in their order those equal to the re-

maining inferior magnitudes of the fixed stars to the 6th inclusive :

1st mag. or brighter, 19 ; 49 ; 61 ; 107 ; 65 ; 5 sixth mag. Total 306*.

During the first half of December 117 meteors were registered, principally

   * On the Gth of December, 1876, Mr. Denning counted 14 stars of tlie Pleiades distinctly

with the naked eye ; and be varied the monotony of a long and fruitless watch for the
Lyrids on the night of April 19th-20tb, 1877, by glimpses of Winnecke's telescopic comet,
in Lacerta, without instrumental aid. This acuteness of vision will perhaps account for
many small meteors being noted in his records which would have passed unnoticed, and
even have escaped detection by the eyes of observers less sensitive to exceedingly faint objects.

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS,  171

in the evening hours, belonging chiefly to tho showers of the ' Geminids
and of the ' Taurids II.,' from /3, £ Tauri. These meteors were, as a class,
slower and brighter thau the majority of tho shooting-stars which had been

recorded in October and November. Mr. Corder's observations were con-
tinued simultaneously with Mr. Denning's in November and December, and,
as will be seen by the Tables at the end of this Appendix, in general corro-

borated very nearly the results which ho obtained.

  --The ' Geminids ' of December \Qth-13th, 1876. This annual star-shower

returned with rather greater brightness than usual on tho principal nights

(December 11th and 12th) of its periodic display. As was related by Mr.
Corder (in the same page of the ' Astronomical Register ' as that above re-

ferred to), his register included ninety-six meteors from the usual radiant-
point in Gemini between the 4th and the 12th (inclusive) of December.
Mr. Denning recorded 37 meteors of the same shower ; but the night of the

11th being cloudy at Bristol, these were principally noted on the 12th ; and
the 11th was, by Mr. Backhouse's estimate of the intensity of the shower at

--Sunderland, rather the better-marked of the two maximum dates of their ap-

pearance. He writes : " On December 11th and 12th the Geminids were
numerous, most so on the 11th. On the two nights I saw 28 meteors, which
was at the rate of 18 per hour for a cloudless sky. On the 8th and 9th the

Geminids were less numerous, but I saw three of them ; and I will forward

full particulars of the shower if they should be required." On the nights
of the 9th, 10th, and 11th the sky was either quite or partly overcast at

Writtle ; but in a clear interval of 40m on the night of the 11th Mr. Corder

saw 16 Geminids. He saw the first member of the shower on December

4th, and he reckoned the horary number of meteors on the 11th and 12th as
" about 13 ' Geminids ' for one observer, or 16 shooting-stars, when uncon-
formable meteors are included." Although it was very clear on the 13th,
but few meteors, Mr. Corder adds, were seen, of which one or two were pos-
sibly from the radiant in Gemini.

 --"With regard to their brightness Mr. Denning writes : " The radiant in

Gemini supplied many large meteors, and I noted two as bright as "Venus,
and several others as bright as Jupiter." Mr. Corder states that " in ap-

pearance they were generally quick, short, and white, without trains or

streaks, except in the case of the larger ones, [of these] six first magnitude

meteors being lemon-yellow in colour, some leaving streaks and others having
trains. Several 2nd magnitude ones were bluish in colour."

   The radiant-point was very well marked, according to Mr. Corder's de-

+scription, " between a and Geminorum, at R. A. 107°, Decl. 35°-5, a few

meteors, however, radiating from near Pollux." Mr. Denning also sus-

pected the existence of a second radiant confirming this last position, and

+while obtaining nearly the same radiant-point, at 106°, 32°, for the principal

shower, believed that there must be two contemporary showers in Gemini
for December, one giving slow meteors with radiant-point between a and d
Geminorum, and the other a few degrees west of j3 Geminorum [and some-
what eastward from the former point], giving rapid meteors. The first true
Geminid was seen on November 21st ; and the meteors of this shower must
not be confused with the ' Gemellids,' a totally distinct shower in Gemini
(first seen by Herrick near e Geminorum, between October 20th and 26th,
1839, and discovered as a very abundant star-shower near e Geminorum from
the 21st to the 25th, and especially on the morning of the 23rd of October,
1868, by Zezioli). This shower Mr. Denning found very active, with a
radiant-point at $ Geminorum, from the 25th to the 29th of October, and

again from the 8th to the 17th of November. From its occurring at an

earlier date, in the stars of the southern twin-comrade asterism (Pollux),

than the Geininids, which radiate from the northern part of the constellation,

the epithet ' Gemellus ' (twin brother) is applied to distinguish the shower of

Gemcllids in October and November from the only other meteor-system (the

annual shower of the Geminids on December ll-12th) whose radiant-point

Aat any season of the year has yet been discovered in that constellation.

pretty active December shower in the Lynx was observed by Mr. Cordcr and

Mr. Denning, whose radiant-point agrees very nearly with one noted by Mr.

Gruey at Toulouse on the 10th and 11th of December, 1874, at 130°, +46°

(see these Reports, vol. for 1875, p. 214).

The Geminids were also well observed in France, according to the bulletins

of the Trench Scientific Association (vol. for 1876-77, p. 208), by the ob-

servers under M. Tisserand's direction at the Observatory of Toulouse. Two

observers counted 106 meteors in two hours between ll h p.m. on the 11th

and lh a.m. on the 12th of December, most of their courses proceeding, ac-

cording to Mr. Perrotin's determination of its place, from a radiant not more

+than 2° or 3° from a position at 115°, 33° (which is a little east of, while

Mr. Denning's and Mr. Corder's places, coincidiug nearly with several

previous determinations near r Geminorum, are a little west of Castor).

A translation of this French notice will be found in ' Nature ' (vol. xv.

p. 207), which also records (p. 208) that the Annuaire du Bureau des
Longitudes for the year 1877 contains for the first time, for the guidance of

observers, a full table of the situations throughout the year of the various

radiant-points of shooting-stars.

  --The January and April meteor-showers in 1877. No regular watch was

kept, owing to very tempestuous weather, for the meteors of January 1st to
3rd, at the beginning of this year ; and although the full moon by its return

on the last night of the preceding year partially dispelled the clouds, few

stars were visible through the haze, and no meteors of this periodical star-

shower were observed.

The watch for the Lyrids on the nights of April 18th to 21st was also

very unsuccessful, from the absence, apparently, of the stai-shower on its

annual date. An account of his attempt to catch some view of the shower on

the night of April 19th-20th is given by Mr. Denning in ' The Observatory,'
(vol. i. p. 50), when he watched continuously for five hours, from 10h 30 m to
15h 30m, in a perfectly clear sky, and recorded 29 paths of shooting-stars.

Of these four only were Lyrids, and only one was a Coronid, a very re-

markable example of the irregular and intermittent intensity of some annual

meteor-streams. During two hours on the morning of April 17th three

Lyrids and none at all from Corona were registered. In April 1873 and

1874, Mr. Denning states, the Lyrids and Coronids were the most active

showers of that month, only the former having a decided maximum of inten-

sity about the 20th of April, while the second, beginning in the first half of

April, lasted with little abatement through the whole of May and even into

AJune. The radiant of the few Lyrids mapped was at 269°, +37°.  similar

+place was obtained (at 265°, 38°) from 31 tracks in the Italian Catalogue

between March 31st and April 13th, and again from 15 tracks in the same

Catalogue between May 3rd and 13th [the mean position of 6 stationary

Lyrids recorded in the Austrian Catalogue, April 20-23, 1867-74, was at

266°*5, +36°-5]. The positions of six other radiant-points faintly marked by

the unconformable meteor-tracks of April 19th-20th, 1877, were similarly

confirmed by Mr. Denning's reductions of the foreign observers' catalogues,

other observations of the Lyrids of the 18th-21st of April last were re-

   The Perseids of August, 1877.--The Committee is indebted to Mr. Denning
and to Mr. Wood for the following abstracts of the rates of frequency and
of the time of maximum of this shower on the night of August 10th. The

nights of the 9th and 11th were overcast at Bristol, and a cloudy state of the
sky was so prevalent during the period of the shower in other parts of Eng-
land, that equally systematic observations of the intensity of the shower else-

where have not yet been received.

observations, and nineteen showers obtained in a preliminary reduction of
the meteors recorded in the Austrian Catalogue (added, with a list of sta-
tionary meteors extracted from the latter catalogue, to the above Tables),
and among the fifty-two radiant-points contained in Mr. Denning's published
catalogue of meteor-showers at the end of this Appendix, seven or eight

well-marked positions are also new to any previously existing records of known
or suspected meteor-showers. Upwards of 35 new radiant-points have ac-
cordingly been added, and at the same time about 100 of the already known

200 or 220 general centres of radiation of meteor- showers throughout the
year have received from these extensive observations and reductions more or

less repeated confirmations.

   Some important deductions from his observations during the fourteen

months from April 1876 to May 1877 (inclusive) were also presented by

Mr. Denning in a paper on the " Visibility of Shooting-stars," in ' The Ob-
servatory ' of July last (vol. i. p. 106), exhibiting the average horary numbers
of meteors visible in the different months, and the total number of shooting-
stars observed of the different apparent magnitudes or degrees of brightness.
Of these magnitudes 1090 were registered during the interval; and of the
various brightnesses recorded, from that of Sirius or of the planets (and
brighter), and from the first and successive magnitudes of the fixed stars to
the fifth, inclusive, there was noted in all the following series of numbers :
Sirius, or brighter, 39 ; 65 ; 190 ; 274 ; 337 ; 176 fifth-magnitude meteors.
Total number of apparent magnitudes registered, 1090.

    In calculating the horary numbers, both the numbers seen and the lengths
of the watches having been regularly noted, one sixth is deducted from the
latter times to obtain the times actually spent in observation ; and clear moon-
less nights having been generally selected, the numbers found represent very
nearly the rates of frequency of the meteors for one observer keeping his
gaze constantly directed eastwards to an altitude of about 40° above the

horizon.

A.M.

--In reference to this summary Mr. Denning writes : " Consulting the

Table it will bo seen that shooting-stars were especially numerous in the

mornings of October, November, and December, and very rare in the evenings

of January and February. The frequency of the Perseids in August will

account for  the large  hourly proportion  a.m. (17'2)  in  that  month                            but  I
                                                                                                ;

have not excluded them from the list, as they have a trivial influence on the

total results. I found that as a rule the rate of frequency is at a minimum

soon after dark, and at a maximum just preceding dawn, the relative horary

numbers being about 6-7 for the former and 12 for the latter period. In

fact, as the night advances the numbers go on increasing ; and I suppose

this would theoretically be the case considering the improving position

taken up by the apex of the earth's way during the successive hours of the

night,"

   The position of the apex of the earth's way in the sky is about 90° east-

wards along the ecliptic from that point of the ecliptic which is opposite to

the sun, or which is on the meridian at midnight. It therefore rises nearly
                                                         OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS.                                                                 ] 75

at that time, and passes the meridian at ahout 6h a. jr. But at the time of

tho September equinox it is above (and in that of March it is below) the

eastern horizon at midnight. As the tendency of the earth's motion is to
make five or six times as many meteors (supposing them not to be collected

into streams) come from the hemisphere about the apex as reach the earth

from that round the antiapex of the earth's way, the altitude which this

meteor-apex reaches above the horizon materially affects their horary abund-

ance. Small changes of its altitude when the apex is near tho horizon (as it
is at midnight) must be much more perceptible in their effect upon the fre-

quency of shooting-stars than the same changes occurring when its altitude

above or its distance below tho horizon is greater, as it is towards sunrise

and sunset. While, therefore, midnight observations are better adapted than

those made either at sunrise or at sunset for exhibiting an annual variation

of the rate of frequency, a somewhat singular and anomalous result is notice-

able in the present table, where the annual maximum and minimum of fre-

quency are not so strongly marked in the result of the evening watches as
they arc in the morning observations (although the minimum in the first

series towards March and the maximum in the latter series towards September
are yet both very plainly indicated). Two sufficient explanations of the dif-

ference will, however, probably be found in these considerations, that the

collection of meteors into irregularly situated streams must disturb their rate

of frequency in the evening hours most sensibly when it is naturally small;
and, again, that the a.m. observations may have really been made at an

average interval after midnight less than that of the p.m. observations before
midnight, and that in consequence the meteor-apex was further from the

horizon (below it) during the evening observations than it was above it, on

the average, during the morning watches. By consulting the special circum-

stances of each watch, and applying for the hour when it is kept a ' tabular

reduction                                           for  the  altitude  of  the  earth's  apex                                       above  the   horizon, so as to
                                                 '

determine the absolute meteor frequency for the hour, with the apex of the

earth's way in a level position or situation in the horizon, a real knowledge

of the actual scarcity and abundance of shooting-stars at different times

Athroughout the year might eventually be obtained.                                                                                            table of the kind

required does not admit                                       of precise         calculation                                         but  as  it  can  be  approxi-
                                                                                                                                  ;

mately constructed and applied, the exact time (the middle of the watch)

for which an horary frequency of shooting-stars seen and counted collectively

has been determined should be recorded with the date of the watch ; and

longer watches than two or three hours (at the furthest) should, whenever

clear and kept uninterruptedly enough, be divided into two or more inter-

vals, over which separate determinations of the mean horary frequency, for

the purpose of determining the true or absolute rate of frequency ' reduced

to midnight ' in each, should be made to extend.

   Professor Schiaparelli and Padre Denza continue to invite the united co-

operation of Italian observers of shooting-stars on a series of nearly weekly
morning and evening dates of the year 1877-78 favourable by the moon's

absence or for contributing special materials to the Italian Catalogue for

observing shooting-stars. At the beginning of this year they circulated the
eighth annual pamphlet of directions for this purpose, containing besides the
concerted and other general occasions for meteor watching, a list of the 14
stations in Piedmont, Italy, and Spain, with the names of their directors,
whose connexion with the Association is still zealously maintained. Anions
the new contributors whose names appear in the present list, Signor Arcimis°
of Cadiz in Spain, is this year one of the active Members of the Italian Meteor-

registering Association.

tion, however, reveals the fact that most of these nodules have more or less

of a Mack mineral associated with them. This substance was ascertained to

-- --he not graphite, as might at first sight have been supposed,- hut chromium

monosulphide, a mineral new both to terrestrial and celestial mineralogy.

Daubreelite, as Dr. Smith has named it, is a black lustrous mineral, highly

crystalline, usually occurring on the surface of the nodules of troilite, but some-

times traversing them ; in one nodule a vein of the mineral, 2 millims. wide
and 12 millims. in length, crosses the very centre of a nodule. It exhibits

a distinct cleavage, is very fragile, and is feebly magnetic : the powdered

mineral is perfectly black and is but slightly acted upon by strong acids, with

the exception of nitric acid, in which it completely dissolves : this reaction
serves to distinguish and separate it from chromite. The mineral has not yet

been completely analyzed; one hundred milligrammes were examined and

found to contain 36-48 per cent, of sulphur, the remainder being chromium

with nearly ten per cent, of iron and a little carbonaceous matter. (Chromiun

                   Found 1S74. "Waconda, Mitchel Co., Kansas*.

This meteorite was found in 1S74, lying above ground upon the slope of

a ravine about two miles from the village of Waconda. Fragments amount-

ing to about one half of the stone were removed at the time ; the remainder,

weighing about 58 lb., is partially covered with a black crust. The freshness

of the original fracture, at the time when the stone was submitted to ex-

amination, points to the fall being one of recent date.

It closely resembles the stone of Searsmont (21st May, 1871) in colour,

but is less choudritic, and only exhibits this characteristic of certain meteorites

in a very imperfect manner. Crystals of what appear to be augite are ob-

served imbedded in an amorphous whitish ground-mass ; nickel-iron is present

thickly   scattered  throughout  the        stone  in     minute rounded        lustrous                             grains

while troilite is now and then met with in grains of considerable size or ag-

Agregations of imperfect-crystals.          fragment partially covered with crust was

found to have a specific gravity =3-81; that of another fragment without

crust was =3-58.

Mechanical separation of the ingredients was attempted and 5-66 per cent,

of nickel-iron and 1-34 per cent, of troilite were isolated. Of the remaining

siliceous portion rather more than one half gelatinized with acid and was,

presumably, olivine ; the remainder, according to Prof. Shepard, consists of
" augite, some felspathic species, and chladnite," by which last mineral en-

statite presumably is meant. There exists a rumour that a second meteorite

has been met with twelve miles distant from the above.

This meteorite fell about midday at a spot named Feid-Chair, about 30

kilometres from La Calle, tho descent being attended with the accustomed

luminous appearance. It weighs about 3S0 grammes ; all search to discover

other stones has proved of no avail. The stone has a black crust and a

grey interior, in which particles of nickel-iron and troilite are imbedded.

Spherules are recognized, but the matrix likewise exhibits a brecciated struc-

ture                 grains of a dull black hue are  also  distributed through the mass.  The

Canellas, near Barcelona (1861, May l4th), and Khetrcc, Rajpootana, India

years that meteorites have been seen to fall in Algiers and have been

The asserted fall of an aiirolite on this date, recorded in the last volume of

these reports (vol. for 1876, p. 164), and again as an authentic stonefall in the

' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ' (vol. xxxvii. pp. 205-6),

is entirely refuted by a letter from Padre Secchi, in the latter volume of the

' Monthly Notices ' (p. 365), in which the real circumstances of the supposed

Ameteor and stonefall are related and described.           flash of lightning which

occurred in the public square of Supino struck a neighbouring house with suf-

ficient violence to dislodge a stone from the roof, without doing any more

material damage to the house. The supposed " meteorite," which fell in the

courtyard of the house, is identified by Padre Secchi with the ordinary

volcanic stones of the district, which is in the neighbourhood of an extinct

volcano, and it probably lay (as it is customary to protect them against the

force of the wind) upon the tiles of the roof until it was projected from its

place by the lightning-stroke.

struck the roof with sufficient force to cut a hole in the metal ; but it did not

pass through, bounding back a few feet and coming to re3t on the roof. Two
observers who were at a window close by heard the sharp concussion when

it struck the roof, and one of them immediately picked up the meteorite as
it lay near her on the roof, but let it fall again, rinding it too hot to retain in
the baud. It is described as of a plano-convex form, one inch and three
quarters along its greatest length and about one third of an inch thick. " The
convex surface possesses the usual crusted appearance, while the inside or
plane surface differs from ordinary meteorites in possessing the appearance of
sulphuret of iron, subjected to some degree of heat, instead of nickeliferous
iron. One might easily infer that the meteorite was shaled off from a large
bolide that passed over the city at that time." It is much to be desired that

this meteorite will pass into the hands of a scientific expert for examination
and description.

    Prof. Kirkwood describes eight large fireballs, between July 1876 and
February 1877 (American Journal of Science, 1877, vol. xiv. p. 75) ; tbe

across the N.E. of Indiana and exploded over Lake Michigan at an altitude
of 34 miles. The path was iuclined 21° to the horizon ; no detonation
reported ; train visible 40 minutes. The account of the meteor given in
Appendix II. of this Report contains all the observed particulars of its

appearance.

This remarkable meteor passed over the States of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,

Indiana, and Ohio, a distance from E. to W. of about 800 miles.- It burst into

numerous fragments during its passage, pi-oducing " a flock of brilliant balls

chasing each other across the sky, the number being variously estimated from

twenty to one hundred." Over all the regions of Central Illinois a series of ter-

rific explosions was heard. Over the northern part of Indiana the passage of

Athe body was followed by loud explosions.   piece of the meteorite, a few

Aounces in weight, fell near Rochester, la.  portion in the possession of Prof.

Shepard was discovered on the following day lying in the snow. Two places

were noticed where it had previously struck, whence it had bounded to its rest-

ing place. It is stated by Prof. Shepard to closely resemble the meteorite of

Pegu, India (27th December, 1857), and to consist of dark ash-grey spherules

(Boltonite),imbcdded in a nearly white pulverulent matrix, " chladnite," olivine

in distinct grains, nickel-iron, and a little troilitc. The specific gravity of a

fragment partially covered with crust was 3-65.

  A meteorite was seen to fall to the ground, at a spot a few miles north of

Cynthiana, on the afternoon of the above day. It penotrated the soil to the
depth of thirteen inches, and the fall was accompanied by " great atmospheric

disturbance." An observer close at hand immediately dug it up. It weighs

15 lbs.

   1877, March 16th, 8 p.m.--Uitcnhage, Cape of Good Hope, 8. Africa f.

  A magnificont fireball, such as few would ever see in a lifetime, made its

appearance in the East, " coming out of the eastern horizon " at Uitcnhage,
" and travelling slowly across the firmament in an oblique direction to the west-

ward, when it burst, sending forth streams of fire, as if from a hundred
rockets, and then was heard alow rumbling noise as of thunder in the distance.
The meteor appeared to be nearly if not quite as large as the full moon,
but not round, more of an oblong shape, and while travelling through the air
it very much resembled a large turpentine ball. It gave forth a bright
bluish light, which lit up the whole sky, and you could distinguish every thing

around you for miles as plainly as in the daytime." Native Hottentots and
Kaffirs, the account adds, were so terrified that they sought refuge in the nearest
houses, and the apparition of the fireball was regarded by them as a warning
of approaching famine, drought, or some other calamity. None of them had
ever seen a meteor of any thing like the size or half so brilliant as the present
one. The oxen in the waggons stopped on the road and could not for some
time be got to start again, others turned round, snapped off the dissclbooms
of the waggons, and bolted for some distance into the bush. The consterna-
tion was general in the country round Uitcnhage. The illumination lasted

nearly a minute, and the light was such that it dazzled the eyes of all who
saw it. The events recorded took place on a beautiful starlight evening.

      ivards in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water.
     Drawn up by Prof. Everett, Secretary.

Observations on a very elaborate scale have been received from the important

Amining district of Scbemnitz, in Hungary.  request for observations was

sent by the Secretary in 1S73 to the Imperial School of Forests and Mines

at Schemnitz ; and, on the receipt of two thermometers, a Committee was
formed to plan and carry out observations. The leading part in the ob-

servations has been taken by Dr. Otto Schwartz, Professor of Physics
and Mathematics, who has furnished an elaborate Report of the results

obtained. This is accompanied by a geological Report drawn up by Pro-

fessor Gustav von Liszkay, and by a geological map with plans and sections

of the mines.

The two thermometers sent being deemed insufficient for the numerous ob-

servations which were eomtemplated, 25 large thermometers were ordered

from a local maker (T. T. Greiner), and the 10 best of these, after being

minutely compared with one of the two thermometers sent (which was non-

registering, and had a Kew certificate), were devoted to the observations.

Three of them were divided to tenths, and the others to fifths of a degree

Centigrade, and all had bulbs of thick glass to ensure slowness of action.

They were found not to change their indications during tLc time requisite

for an observation.

The observations were, for the most part, taken by boring a hole in the rock

to a depth, in the earlier observations, of -422, and in the later ones of -70

of a metre, then filling the hole with water, and, after leaving it, in some cases

for a few hours, in others for several days, to plunge a thermometer to the

bottom of the hole, and after 30 or 45 minutes take it out and read it. The

tenths of a degree were read first, and there was time for this to be done before
the reading changed. As a rule, three observations were taken in each

gallery, two of them in bore-holes to give the temperature of the rock, and

the third in the air of the gallery at an intermediate position. Pyrites and

also decaying timber were avoided, as being known to generate heat ; and,

as far as possible, currents of air and the neighbourhood of shafts were

avoided also.

  A table which forms part of Dr. Schwartz's Report contains observations

made in no fewer than thirty-eight galleries. Besides the temperatures, it

gives the depth of the place of observation beneath the shaft-mouth, and the

height of the latter above sea-level. Dr. Schwartz takes exception to a few
                                                                                                                                   OX UXDEKGKOUXD TEMPERATURE.  l'Jj

of the observations in the tabic, as being vitiated by the presence of pyrites
or by currents of air.

    All the galleries mentioned in the tabic arc classified according to the
sbaits with which they arc connected, and there are, tor the most part, six

of these galleries to each shaft. In the final reductions, Dr. Schwartz com-

pares the temperature in the deepest gallery of each shaft with the assumed
liican annual temperature of the ground at the shaft-mouth. For determining

this latter element the following data are employed.

   The mean temperature of the air at the School of Mines, fiorn twenty

 years' observation, is 7°-2 C, at the height of 012-6 metres above sea-level.
The shaft-mouths arc at heights of from 498 to 703 metres above sea-level

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

 and it is assumed that the temperature of the air falls 1° C. for 100 mctus

of elevation. It is further assumed that the mean temperature one met]
deep in the soil is, in these particular localities, 1° C. higher than the mean
temperature of the air. The reasons given for this last assumption may be
thus summarized :

   (1) Observations in various localities show that in sandy soils the excess
in question amounts, on the average, to about half a degree Centigrade.

(2) In this locality, the surfaco is a compact rock, which is highly

heated by the sun in summer, aud is protected from radiation by a covering

of snow in winter                                                                                                                  and the conformation of the hills in the neighbourhood is
                                                                                                                                ;

such as to give protection against the prevailing winds. Hence the excess is

probably greater here than in most places, and may fairly bo assumed to be

double of the above average.

Omitting one shaft (Franz shaft), in which, owing to tho presence of

--pyrites, the temperatures are abnormal, the following arc the principal re-

sults :

ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.          197

Matthew Heckels, Manager of Boldou Collier)-, between Newcastle and
Suuderl and, in holes bored upwards to a distance of 10 feet from some of the
deepest seams. The mine is doscribed as " perfectly dry," and those parts of
it in which these observations were made are quite free from currents of air.
The surface of the ground is tolerably level, and is 07 feet above Trinity high-

water mark.

   Hole No. 1 is bored up from the roof of the Bensham seam. The thermo-
meter (one of the new slow-action instruments, not self-registering) was
placed at the end of the hole, so as to be 10 feet within the rock, and pro-
tected by air- tight plugging. The surrounding strata consist of arenaceous
strata known as " grey metal." The distance of the thermometer from the

surface of the ground overhead was 1365 feet.
   The hole had been standing idle for some time when the thermometer was

inserted, April 5, 1876. The first reading was taken April 26, and was 75°,
the surrounding air being at 75|° and almost stagnant. The readings were
repeated during four consecutive weeks, without change of the indications.

  --Hole No. 2 is in the same vertical with No. 1, and is bored up (also to the

height of ] feet) from a deeper scam the Hutton seam. The same thermo-
meter was employed and in the same manner. The surrounding strata con-
sist of a close compact sandstone known as " hard post." The distance of
the thermometer from the surface of the ground overhead was 1514 feet.

    Immediately after the drilling of the hole, June 6, 1876, the thermometer

was inserted, and on July 4 the first reading was taken, namely 81°. On

July 24 it had fallen to 791°, and on August 1 to 79°. Readings taken
August 15 and 29 and September 1 also showed 79°, the surrounding air
having never altered from the fixed temperature 78|°. It would therefore
appear that the first observation in this hole was 2° too high, owing to the
remains of the heat generated in boring, notwithstanding the lapse of 4 weeks

which had intervened. Four readings have since been taken at regular in-

tervals, endiug with July 1877, and the same temperature, 79°, continues to

be shown.

   Assuming 4S° as the mean annual temperature of the surface, we have the
following data for calculating the rate of increase downwards :

  Surface                    48° F.
                             75
1365 feet                    79
1514 feet

   For the interval of 149 feet between the two holes we have an in-

crease of 4° F., which is at the rate of 1° F. in 37 feet.

   For the whole depth of 1514 feet, from the surface to the lower hole, we

have an increase of 31°, which is at the rate of 1° F. in 49 feet.
    In explanation of the length of time required for the heat of boring to

disappear in the second hole, Mr. Heckels remarks that " it required two men

sixteen hours with a hand boring-machine to drill this hole, so hard is the

stratum." He further says, " the tool by which this hole was bored, on

being drawn out, was too hot to allow of it being touched with the hand, so
that the temperature of the hole, on being fiuished, must have been con-
siderable ; and no doubt it would be, when we consider the immense pres-

sure required to bore holes in such strata as this." "With respect to the per-

--manent temperature (781°) of the surrounding air, Mr. Heckels remarks

" The air of this district is almost stagnant, and what circulation there is will

have travelled a distance of three miles underground, and hence it may be
198 report-- 1877.

expected to be itself pretty near the temperature of the rocks through which

it is circulating."

Ihe dryness of the mine, the absence of currents of air, and the great depth

render these observations extremely valuable for the purpose which the Com-

mittee have in view ; and their best thanks are due to Mr. Heckels and the
proprietors of the colliery for the trouble and expense which have been in-

curred in procuring them. Observations will shortly be taken in another

bore in the same colliery.

During the past year the first observations have been received from India.

They were taken by Mr. H. B. Medlicott, M.A., of the Geological Survey, in
holes made in search of coal, and have been published by him in the ' llecords

of the Geological Survey of India,' vol. x. pt. i. The instrument employed was

a protected Negrotti thermometer, sent by the Secretary of this Committee to

ADr. Oldham, the Director of the Survey.                                                               Casella-Miller thermometer was

used to check the observations, but was found much less sensitive and steady,

and its readings, though placed on record, are therefore left out of account

by Mr. Medlicott in his reductions.

The observations were taken in three bores, at places named Khappa,

Manegaon,  and Moran                                                             but the observations  at Moran were made  only fcur
                                                                              ;

hours after the boring tool had been at work ; and the Khappa bore exhibited

a strong bubbling, besides other marks of convection. The results obtained

at these two bores must therefore be discarded : but in the Manegaon bore
every thing was favourable for satisfactory observation. "It was closed on

the 24th of April, 1875, so that it had been at rest for 20 months. There is

only one guide-pipe, ten feet long, at the top of tho bore, there never having

been any pressure of water in the hole. The position is low, and the water

had always stood at or near the mouth of the tube. There was no difficulty

in removing the plug. The very equable series of temperatures is the natu-

ral result of these conditions. The observations were taken in the evening

of the 5th and morning of the 6th of December. At 5 p.m. the air temperature

was 72° ; at 8 r.M., 5!,°; at 8 a.m., 65°; at 11 a.m., 8-1°. Tho slight decrease
of temperature in the top readings is a good proof of the perfectly tranquil

conditions of observation. It is no doubt due to the excess of summer In at

not yet abstracted ; and it is apparent that that influence reaches to a consi-
derable d( pth, quite to 60 feet." The following arc the observations :

              310

   The observation at 310 feet was in mud, the hole, which had originally a
depth of 420 feet, having silted up to such an extent that 310 feet was the
lowest depth attainable. The increase from 60 feet downwards is remarkably

 uniform, and tho whole increase from this degth to the lowest reached is
 3°-7, which is at tho rate of 1° F. for 68 feet.

     The elevation of Manegaon is estimated at L400 feet. It lies "in an open
 valley of the Satpuras, traversed by the Dudhi river, south of tho wide plains
 of the Narbada valley, about halfway between Jabalpur and Hoshungabad,
 which arc 150 miles apart." Jabalpur is 1351 feet above sea-level, and has
 a mean annual temperature of 75 0, 2. Hoshungabad is 1020 feet above sea-
 level, and has a mean annual temperature of 78 3 vi.

    " The geological conditions of the position are favourable for these obser-
 vations. The rocks consist of steady alternations, in about equal proportions,
 of fine softish sandstones and hard silty clays of the Upper Gondwana strata,
having a steady dip of about 10°. . . . Strong trap-dykes are frequent in many
 parts of the stratigraphical basin ; but there are none within a considerable
 distance of these borings. There are no faults near, nor any rock features
 having a known disturbing effect upon the heat-distribution."'

    Mention was made in last Report (p. 209) of two methods, which had
 been suggested by members of the Committee, for plugging bores to prevent

 the convection of heat. Mr. Lebour, at the request of the Committee, has con-

--ducted experiments during the past year on both forms of plug. He reports

t hat " In accordance with Sir W. Thomson's suggestion, disks of india-rubber

 fixed to the lowering wire above and below the thermometer have been tried.
The chief difficulty met with was the unwieldiness of the armed portion of

the wire, which could not be wound and unwound from the drum, owing to

 the fixed disk-holders. This difficulty prevented the placing of the disks any-

where but at the extremity of the wire, whereas it would be very desirable
to have a large number of them at intervals along the greater part of its en-
tire length. Disks for a 21-inch bore were found to work well with a dia-
meter of 2-1- inches. The lowering and especially the raising of the wire
armed with the disk-plugging were very slow operations, owing to the resist-
ance opposed by the water to the passage of the disks."

    Experiments with the form of plug devised by Mr. Lebour himself were
continued with a set of better made plugs. " The great disadvantage of this
system of plugging is the necessity of using two wires, one to lower the

thermometer and plug as usual, and the other to let down weights upon the
upper ends of the plugs when they are to be expanded, and to remove them
when they are to be collapsed. This necessitates not only the ordinary drum
for the first wire, but also an independent reel for the second. With care,
however, and after some practice, the apparatus was found to work well ; but

it certainly is extremely inconvenient for rapid work, as it requires a good

deal of setting up."

    Experiments were made with both forms of plug at the depth of 800 feet,
in a bore of the total depth of 420 feet. In the one case eight india-rubber
disks were employed, four above and four below the thermometer ; in tho
other, two collapsible plugs, one above and one below.

    The experiments had chiefly in view the mechanical difficulties of the sub-
ject, and are not decisive as to the sufficiency of the plugs to prevent convection.
--200 report 1877

Report of the Committee, consisting of James R. Napier, F.R.S., Sir

   W. Thomson, F.R.S., W. Froude, F.R.S., J. T. Bottomley, and

    Osborne Reynolds, F.R.S. (Secretary), appointed to investigate

    the Effect of Propellers on the Steering of Vessels.

Since the meeting of the British Association held in Glasgow last year, the
Ccmmittee has been able to carry out some further experiments on steering
as affected by the reversing of the screw.

    The largest vessel experimented upon last year was the barge No. 12, of
about 500 tons, and it appeared, on comparing the behaviour of this vessel
with the behaviour of those of smaller size, that the larger the ship the more
important would the effect of reversing the screw become. This view has
been completely borne out by the experiments of this year, made with one
vessel of 850 tons and another of 3594 tons.

   In May last the 'Melrose,' a new vessel belonging to Messrs. Donald
Cnrrie & Co., was tried at the instance and under the superintendence of Mr.

James R. Napier. The ' Melrose ' is 228 feet in length by 29 feet in breadth,
 and 16 feet 3 inches hi depth. She is 850 tons gross register ; her propeller
makes 90 revolutions per minute with the vessel going at a speed of

 lOf knots.

  --The following is Mr. Napier's report of the trials:- "These expciiments

were made on 3rd of May 1877, between Wemyss Bay and Rothsay. There

 was little or no wind; the sea was glassy smooth. The draft of water was
 9 feet 1 inch forward, and 12 feet 5 inches aft ; the diameter of the propeller
was 11 feet G inches, the pitch 14 feet 3 inches, it had 4 blades and was

ri^ht-handed. The maxinmm speed at the nautical mile was 10| knots ; but
 the speed was about 10 knots when the trials were made.

   "A trial was made with the rudder said to be amidships, and the ship's

 head turned to starboard : but it was found afterwards that the pointer on
 the bridge had been misplaced, and, as it was difficult at the time to ascertain

--the rudder's position, the result was uncertain.
    ·'First mock collision trial. The vessel was steaming about 10 knots when
 the telegraph bell warned the engineer to stand by his engines, and shortly
 after the bell was rung for him to reverse at full speed (no intermediate
 order to slow or stop being given) ; in 15 seconds after this order was given

 the engines began to reverse, and in 2 minutes 15 seconds after the giving
 of the order to reverse, the forward motion of the ship had entirely stopped.

     "At the instant that the engineer below telegraphed to the captain on deck
 that his engines were reversing, the captain gave the order " Hard aport"
 which was quickly obeyed by the two men at the week The vessels head
 almost immediately commenced turning to port, and when the ship's way was
 stopped, or about 2 minutes after the order to port was given, the vessel's

--head had turned 26 or 2S degrees to port._
     " Second mock collision trial. Every thing was done in the same manner
 as in the first trial, except in this case the order was to starboard hard.
 The vessel's way was lost in about the same time. Tlie vessel's head com-
  menced to turn to starboard cdmost immediately after the enr/ines began to
 reverse, and when the forward way was lost, her head had gone round 40° to

  starboard.

   " These results were so contrary to the expectation of some of the nautical
party on hoard, that they made a third mod- collision trial (a second one with
the helm hard aport) ; but on this occasion the orders to reverse the engines
and to port the helm were given simultaneously. The result was similar to

the first trial, the head turning a long way to port ; but I was not on the
bridge to note the angle through which her head moved before head-way was

lost.

   " Mr. Currie, one of the owners of the ship, most of the nautical men and

visitors on board learned, I think, something regarding the steering of screw-
steamers, and a cause of some, if not of many, collisions which they did not

know before. The Captain of the ship, however, when asked before the
trials what would be the result of the sudden reversal of the engines, with

the helm aport or starboard, stated the direction in which the ship's head

would turn as it actually happened."
   The Committee wish to thank Mr. Currie for allowing them the use of his

ship for the experiments.
    It will be seen, from Mr. Napier's report, that the 'Melrose' behaved in

precisely the same way as did the vessels last year, except that the effect of
the reversed screw on the action of the rudder was even more apparent than
in the previous trials. This was obviously owing to the greater size of the

ship, and the consequently greater time taken by the reversed screw in bring-
ing her to rest, and the result led the Committee to conclude that with still
larger ships the result would be yet more pronounced.

    This conclusion has been verified in a somewhat unexpected although in a
most satisfactory manner; for, after arriving at Plymouth, the Secretary
received the following account of trials made in the s.s. ' Hankow,' of London,
3594 tons, by Captain Symmington, the commander, in response to the

circular issued by the Committee last year, but otherwise at his own

instance.

5 knots an hour. The perusal of the extract of the report on these trials
received by the Committee and appended to this report, shows at once that
the conditions under which the experiments were made were such as to pre-
clude the possibility of their throwing much light on the subject. The
greatest speed of tho vessel was 5 knots, and the effect of the rudder with
the screw reversed was so small, that the vessel, in most instances, turned
her forward end into the wind.

   On the receipt of the report of these trials, a letter was written to the

Admiralty, urging them to have experiments made with larger and more
powerful ships, but as yot no further communication has been received.

    In accordance with the resolution by which they were appointed, the
Committee have communicated with the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the
Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, and other Corporations, and copies of
the last year's report were forwarded as soon as they could be obtained ; no
intimation has yet been received of any action being taken by these bodies.

    It appears, from an article in the ' Nautical Magazine ' of December, that
the last report of the Committee was discussed at the conference of the

Association for the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations, held last
year at the Ancient House, City of Bremen, when the following resolution

was agreed to :

     " It is the opinion of the Conference that the existing international rules

for preventing collisions at sea are not of a satisfactory character, and that it
is desirable that the Governments of the maritime states should take counsel

together with a view to amend these rules and to adapt them more carefully

to the novel exigencies of steam navigation;"

    The article in tho ' Nautical Magazine ' was written by Sir Travers Twiss,
and in this and in a subsequent article he discusses the facts established by
the Committee, and their bearing on the question of the alteration of the
rule of the road at sea, pointing out the absolute necessity of modifying
Article 15 of the Amended Board of Trade Steering and Sailing Rules, which
are likely to become law.

    These and other notices which have appeared in English and foreign pub-
lications show that the subject has already attracted considerable attention

and it is important to notice that in no way have the conclusions of the

Committee been in the smallest degree controverted.

    Numerous collisions have occurred during the year, which, to judge from
the law reports, might in many instances have been avoided had the effect of
reversing the screw been known and acted upon ; but it does not appear as
 if a consideration of this has influenced any of the judgments given.

    The collisions have for the most part been with small ships, and so have
 not attracted much attention ; but the loss of the ' Dakota ' was a disaster of
 the first magnitude, and if it was not due to the porting of the helm with
 the screw reversed it might have been, for as soon as the officers became
 aware of their extreme danger (the shore being on their port bow) the helm
 was put hard aport and the screw reversed full speed, after which, according
 to the evidence of Mr. Jones, a pilot on board, the vessel turned to port until
 she struck. The evidence offered by the Secretary of the Committee was,
 however, rejected by the Commissioner of Wrecks (Mr. Rothery), on tho
 ground that the ship was virtually lost before the screw was reversed. It is
 to be noted, however, that the orders to reverse the engines and to port tho
 helm were avowedly given in the hope of saving the ship, and that had there
 been a chance of escape, such action, as shown by all the experiments of the
 Committee, must most certainly have reduced it.

                                         APPENDIX.

Extract from Report of Captain of Steam Reserve at Portsmouth, data!
                                       24th January, 1877.

                          Experiments on tlte Turning of Screw Ships.

   I have the honour to report that, as already reported in my letter, dated
30th "September, 1870, to the Admiral Superintendent (through whom 1

received the original copy of experiments required), there have been no
opportunities of making experiments on this subject, on account of ships
going out on trial having their time fully occupied, and there have been no
ships in the First lieserve which could be taken out for the purpose.

    Observing, however, from the report in the ' Nautical Magazine ' referred
to, that the largest vessel of which particulars of trial are given is only
80 tons, I took the ' Speedy,' of 273 tons, out and tried the experiments
required with her : her speed is only about 5 knots ; draught of water 7 feel
10 inches ; rig one small mast forward ; screw right-handed, Griffith's, two-
bladed, diameter 6 feet 1 inch, pitch feet. The results are given in at-

tached sheet.

   An opportunity also occurred of getting one trial of No. G in the ' Eu-

phrates,' while waiting for tide. While going ahead the screw was stopped

and reversed, the helm being kept amidships ; the ship's head came steadily
round to starboard (windward) 12 : till head to wind, then fell off to port,

and continued to do so till stern to wind. An experienced pilot (Mr.
Harding) who was with me told me beforehand that this would be the case.

   The experiments with the 'Speedy' were conducted by myself, with the as-

sistance of Staff-Commander Parker, and Mr. Iril By, chief gunner of ' A sia ' for

lieserve.

   I think it may he taken as nearly certain that in all cases of putting the

helm over and reversing the screw at the same time the ship will obey the
helm for a limited time, the amount depending on the way the ship has, her
rig, and the direction of the wind and sea with reference to her course, and
that as she loses her way she will fall off from the wind until she brings it
astern or nearly so. Also, that on reversing the engines with the helm kept
amidships, she will come up head towards the wind, and then fall off before

the wind as she loses her way.

  It is going beyond the part of the article marked for my remarks, but I

would venture to express an opinion that it would be highly undesirable to

remove the obligation now imposed on ships " approaching each other, so as

to involve risk of collision," to reverse their engines. If the action of ships
with engines reversed is as I have said above, the reversing not only reduces

the risk of serious damage, by lessening the way of both ships, but brings them
parallel to each other, thereby placing them in a good position to avoid collision.

    I would also submit that it is desirable that attention should be called to
the power of the steering-gear. I think it probable that in large steamers
of great speed, with small crews, aud not fitted with steam steering-gear,

the number of men usually kept at the wheel would be found quite inade-

quate to get the helm hard over till the speed of the ship was reduced.
   It is worth consideration whether it should not be made obligatory, on

steam-ships over a certain size and speed carrying emigrants or passengers, to
be fitted with steam steering-gear, which I believe is not the case at present.

   I believe a doubt exists with many people whether it is safe and proper
to reverse engines when going at full speed ahead at once to full speed

astern                                   this doubt (if it exists) should be removed, and it  should be  clearly
                                      ;

understood that engines arc to stand being suddenly reversed from extreme

speed one way to the opposite extreme.

208 report-- 1877.

   There is no symptom of the diminution of the interest which the Sea-birds
Preservation Act (1869) has always excited ; and within the past twelve
months application for the extension of the Close Time has been made, ac-
cording to the provisions of that Act, by the Justices in Quarter-Sessions of

--Northumberland, Lancashire, and the North Riding of Yorkshire facts

which sufficiently speak for the general appreciation of the measure.
   The Wild-Birds Protection Act (1872) is possibly viewed by the public

with greater favour than either of the others ; but your Committee sees little
reason to modify the opinion of it expressed in former Reports. Neverthe-

less a conviction under it, presenting some rather important features, in May

last, indicates that it is not so entirely useless as had been thought.'
   The Wild-Fowl Preservation Act (1876) came into operation this year,

and at first undoubtedly caused some discontent in many quarters, a warm

discussion of its principle and provisions being raised by a portion of the

public press. Your Committee, however, has noticed with much satisfaction
that virtually no objection was taken to its principle, while the necessity of
some enactment of the kind was conceded on almost every side. Further-

more, very nearly the sole cause of complaint lay in regard to the limits of

the Close Time therein imposed, on which point no blame attaches to your
Committee. The limits of the Close Time proposed in the Bill, as draughted
by your Committee and introduced into Parliament, were, as stated in last
year's Report, altered in its passage through the House of Commons ; the
change being such as your Committee then declared did not meet with its
approval. Your Committee is therefore in no way responsible for the unsea-
sonableuess of the Close Time which was enacted, and believes that the

soundness of its views on the subject is now generally admitted. In con-
firmation of this belief, it may be stated that the Justices in Quarter-Sessions

of the counties of Dorset, Norfolk, Kent. Somerset, Southampton, Wigtown,

and Essex have severally made application to the Home Office for such an

alteration of the Close Time as will bring it more or less nearly in accordance
with that originally proposed by your Committee.

    Another charge was brought against this Act. It was alleged to be im-

perfect in that it did not expressly prohibit the possession or sale during the

Close Time of birds of the kinds professedly protected, which had been im-
ported into this country from abroad. This charge was supported by the
dismissal (on the latter ground) by two magistrates of informations laid
against certain poultrymen or game-dealers in London, and if it could have
been sustained would undoubtedly have proved the Act to be defective. But
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals appealed against
one of these decisions ; and on the 15th of June judgment was given in the

Common Pleas Division of Her Majesty's Court of Appeal against the defen-

dants in the case, thus proving that the legal interpretation of the Act agreed
with the intention of its promoters.

    Your Committee has satisfaction in finding that the Fisheries (Oysters,
Crabs and Lobsters) Bill passed the House of Commons on the 2nd of August,
and it has now doubtless become law. It appears curious that no Close
Time had hitherto been provided by the legislature for these important and

favourite articles of food.

    Having regard to the applications made from time to time to different
members of your Committee, by various persons interested in seeing the Close
Time principle more widely applied, your Committee respectfully solicits its

reappointment.

                                                                                                                                                    I
        ON SOME DOUBLE COMPOUNDS OF NICKEL AND COBALT.                              20'J

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.E.,
   Mr. W. C. Roberts, F.R.S., and Mr. John M. Thomson, appointed

  for the purpose of investigating some Double Compounds of Nickel

   and Cobalt. By Mr. John M. Thomson.

                                                   Part I.

On attempting to form the conjugated sulphate of Nickel, Cobalt, and Po-

tassium, the existence of which is mentioned by Vohl (Ann. Chem. Pharm.,
vol. lxv.), who assigns asits composition the formula NiCoK4(S04 )4,12H20,
it was found that the several fractions of crystals deposited consecutively
from a solution containing molecular quantities of the simple potassic sul-
phates of the two metals were of different colours, and showed also to a re-
markable degree the property of dichroism. The operation being repeated
several times with a like result, it was determined to prepare a series of
fractions from a solution containing the two potassic sulphates

        NiK  2  (S0  4)a  ,6H         and  CoK            (S04)  2  ,6H
                                   2                   2                      2

in molecular proportions, to submit each fraction to analysis, and to examine

whether or not any regular replacement between the nickel and cobalt took

place.

For this purpose 250 grammes of each potassic sulphate in the anhydrous

condition were accurately weighed, dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water,:

and evaporated gently over a water-bath, the temperature of the solution
never being allowed to rise above 80° C. The solution was thus fractionally

crystallized, the several fractions consecutively deposited constituting the

Aseries of salts marked i., n., in., rv., v.
  A second quantity, consisting of 250 grammes of each potassic sulphate

in the pure crystallized condition, having been crushed, pressed between
blotting-paper and finally air-dried, was dissolved in water and fractionally

crystallized at the same temperature as in the first instance. These fractions
constitute the series of salts marked Bi., n., iii.,iv., v., vi. In both these
cases care was taken to purify the salts before commencing the experiments.

   The crystals of the conjugated double sulphates are oblique rhombic prisms,
having a tendency to modification when allowed to grow to any great size.
The first fractions possess a greenish-grey colour when seen in the mass,
showing the preponderance in them of the nickel over the cobalt ; the latter
fractions, however, become more crimson in colour as the reverse action takes
place. The salts do not lose their water entirely till between 150° to 180° C,

and can be fused without decomposition. On heating the first fractions in

a crushed condition in the air-bath, the colour changes from a light grey to

purple, finally becoming pink when the water is entirely driven off ; if the
salts be heated in a porcelain or platinum capsule they fuse, the liquid mass

becoming of an intensely deep-blue colour, which fades on cooling, the mass

solidifying to the pink anhydrous salt. This deep-blue colour can be again
produced, however, by fusing the dried salt, and is evidently due to some
change not explained by loss of water.

   The following Tables give the details and results of the analyses of the two

Aseries of salts marked and P>. The replacement of the nickel and cobalt is

also graphically represented by the curves in the diagrams of each series of

salts given below.

The method generally employed in the determination of the nickel and
KHOrx>balt was that of Liebig, viz. by treatment with HCy and
                                                                                  to obtain

the cyanides hi solution, precipitating the nickel as NiO with mercuric

oxide and separating the cobalt from the filtrate by mercurous nitrate, the

mercurous  cobalticyanide  being   ignited  and weighed  as Co                4.  It may be
                                                                           3

mentioned that in many cases the determinations by this method were

checked by others conducted by separating the cobalt as double nitrite of

cobalt and potassium, incinerating this body, washing out the alkali, and

finally determining the cobalt as  CoS0 by           evaporation with         sulphuric  acid.
                                                  4

In these latter cases the nickel was determined in the nitrate from the double

nitrite of potassium and cobalt by precipitation with potash.

The water and sulphuric acid were determined in the usual manner. The

potash was determined by difference in most cases, but was occasionally

checked by determining it as potassium sulphate.

   The Roman numbers indicate the different fractions of the conjugated salts. The co-

ordinate numbers show the percentage of NiO, and the abscissas numbers the percentage

of CoO in the several fractions.

   The Konnan numbers indicate the different fractions of the conjugated salts. The co-

ordinate numbers show the percentage of NiO, and the abscissa; numbers the percentage

of CoO in the several fractions.

It will be seen from these numbers that a regular replacement between

the nickel and cobalt oxides takes place, while the percentage amounts of

water, sulphuric anhydide, and potassium oxide remain the same. In the

several successive fractions we have a regular decrease of the quantity of

nickel with an increase in the quantity of cobalt, the amounts of both to-

gether, however, giving a practically constant number for each fraction.

Taking the quantities of nickel and cobalt together, the formula given by

Vohl might express         the  relation  thus       (M"M")K                        (S0  4  )     ,12H     ; but to ex-

of the report.

   The examination of the optical properties of the several fractions presents

some details of considerable interest. When the crystals are examined

through the two opposite axes, a change of colour in the several fractions

may be observed to take place in the following order down the series :

Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,

  Prof. Prestwich, Prof. Busk, Prof. T. M'K. Hughes, Prof. W.
  Boyd Dawkins, Prof. Miall, Rev. H. W. Crosskey, and Mr. R.

   H. Tiddeman, appointed for the purpose of assisting in the Explora-

   tion of the Settle Caves (Victoria Cave). Drawn up by R. H.
   Tiddeman (Reporter).

The Local Committee have this year sustained a great loss in the death of

their Chairman, Sir James P. Kay-Shuttleworth, Bart. Sir James took a

great interest in the work from the commencement. He recommended us to

employ in working the admirable methods of excavation so inseparably con-

nected with the names of Mr. Pengelly and Kent's Cavern, and which, with

slight modifications, were adopted. Besides his liberal contributions to the

fund, his business-like method of conducting the Committee's meetings was

of the greatest service to the undertaking.

The work has been carried on almost continuously since we last reported

at Glasgow up to the 14th of July last. As the state of our funds was then

very low, it was determined to give up work for a time ; and it has not yet

been resumed.

   In our last Report we called attention to a very stiff, dark, laminated clay

which occurred in chambers A and D at a lower level than the principal

bone-bed or hyaena-bed. It was separated from the underlying yellow sandy

clay by a thin bed of stalagmite of varying thickness. A large part of our

time in the past year has been taken up in removing portions of these beds

in these two chambers, working them down to a lower level inwards, in order

to be able to work at the back of the cave. In doing this it was found that

these beds rose as we proceeded inwards towards the junction of the ends of

Achambers and D. Large blocks of fallen limestone occurred along the
Dright wall of chamber and much impeded us and others at the junction of
A and D. No bones occurred in this portion of the work, except at 2 feet

Parallel 34, where we obtained bones of a large bear, of a goat, of a large ox,

also a gnawed antler of Red Deer. These were at a depth of 13 feet.

On the 16th of November we had made a sufficiently good clearance of the

route to the further junction of these two chambers to enable us to carry on

our investigation in this direction ; and as the beds were rising inwards, we

entertained a hope that by working on these we might come to earlier beds than

we had yet discovered. The result confirmed our expectations, and, although

Wenot in any way sensational, was very interesting.  had previously worked

for some time in an easterly direction from this point, but without much

practical result. The beds were so wet and slippery that the section could

not be properly observed. There was no drainage for the water which was

accumulating ; and in short, to use a miner's phrase, we were " drowned

Weout."  now resolved to try in another direction ; and finding that at the

Aend of chamber the deposits ran further north beneath the limestone, and

that there was no true wall to the cave at that spot, we proceeded to make a

cut to the north in the direction of an old shaft at the end of chamber B.

There were two reasons for selecting this direction. First, it would show

us the extent of the cave to the north, and whether B was separated from A
A Dor continuous with it at the further end, as and had been proved to be.

Secondly, in that old shaft hyaena had been first discovered, many years ago,

by Mr. Jackson in his earlier researches, and identified by Dr. Buckland
216 report--1877.

there was therefore a chance of our again hitting the hyaena-hed at this

spot.

  We hegan by cutting a level 6 feet wide and 9 feet high (i. e. up to the

rocky roof) ; but we very soon had to widen this at the top, for the materials

were of so slippery a naturo that they would not stand in a vertical face for
long together. The section, however, was carefully measured and drawn to

scale as the work proceeded ; so that no errors coidd arise from slips. The

black laminated clay which lies beneath the hysena-bed, and to which wo

referred in our last Report, was seen to rise towards the roof ; and beneath it
was a bed of stalagmite about 1 foot thick. This also rose for a distance of

16 feet, then fell, and rose again when nearing chamber B, except at the end,

where it again had a slight dip north. In a kind of basin lying on this sta-

lagmite in the middle part of the cut lay three beds, each about half a foot

thick, consisting in ascending order of yellow sandy clay, stalagmite, and a

darker clay. All these beds were destitute of animal remains. The same

may be said of a lower great mass of dark clay lying below the thick stalag-

mite, from 4 to 6 feet in thickness, which was similar to that above the same

stalagmite at the south end of the cut. It ran along the whole section, and,

indeed, in a mass of broken and confused stalagmite and clay at the end of
chamber B.

The entire absence of remains from theso beds, at so short a distance from

others which present a throng of animal life, would almost lead us to specu-

late upon the absence of any fauna from the district when they were being
formed. Or perhaps we might be led to suppose that the wet slippery mud
of which they arc chiefly composed was not of a nature to tempt beasts of

prey into these recesses to dovour their quarry. But in this we must be
cautious. Chamber D, when first explored, was (though not ankle-deep
certainly, for wo eoidd not stand up in it) at least fist-deep in soft mud.
Yet in this clay, and in many parts quite at the surface of it, we came upon
the richest assemblage of remains that we have found in the entire cavern.

We must therefore beware how wc gauge a hyaena's or bear's ideas of

comfort by our own.

   After this long interval of lifeless beds it was with no little satisfaction
that, at the base of the thick clay already referred to, we came upon evidence,

scanty but yet sufficient, of an earlier occupation of the district. Two teeth

of a small wolf, a canine and molar (^ and -|j, were discovered resting on

the surface of a yellow sandy clay. They were 7 feet from the commence-
ment of the north cut, and 6| feet below the rocky roof. Unfortunately

these are the only indications of life yet found relating to this time, which,
judging by the thickness of barren beds between, was long prior to the age

of the abundant life-assemblage of the hyaena-bed. Of one thing we may

feel quite sure, that the presence of this carnivore implies the coexistence of

other animals on which it could feed ; and though at present we know not

what they were, we may hope that further exploration will give us fuller

information.

On the 10th of February, 1877, we succeeded in effecting, at the further

end of the North Cut, an entrance into the further end of chamber B. Our

cutting, however, though it kept to the limestone rock as a roof all the

way, was found to be two feet below the bottom of the old shaft at the end

Wcof that chamber.  calculated that the cut would be about forty feet in

length, and we found it forty-one and a half.
   When we were obliged to leave off work wc were clearing away the deposits

                                                                                 i

on the left side of chamber A, consisting of largo blocks of limestone in clay,

and reducing that part to the same level as the right side of that chamber.

Our object in doing this is that we may reduce the level of the whole of our

present floor of working across the chamber to the depth necessary to disclose

the old river-bed, which must have been the lowest level of the cave. Several

indications lead us to suppose that we are not far off it, especially at the
entrance. The arching of the right wall, and the occurrence of several

grooves along it, apparently indicating old water-levels, are very suggestive

that we are at last neariug the original bottom of the cave. When that is

reached we can scarcely fail to meet with much that is interesting.

The present entire absence of conditions which could render the existence

of a large stream possible in or near the cave as it now stands, taken in con-

nexion with the fact of the present stream being 900 feet below us, suggests

such an enormous interval of time necessary to effect these changes that we
might almost stand aghast at it did we not remember how great and many

are the vicissitudes which havo occurred in that interval, and to which the

cave and the surrounding district bear witness. Prom to-day to Romano-
Celtic times is our first stage as we go back into the past, and that probably

the shortest in the whole journey. The next takes us into the cloudland of

Neolithic times. Then, after an unknown interval, we come to the submer-

gence and emergence of parts of Lancashire to a depth of several hundred

Afeet.    further step, probably a long one, shows us the north of England

swathed in a great sheet of ice, which advanced and retired perhaps more

than onco. Again the scene changes, and the hyaena (that admirable histo-

rian) gives a record of his life and times. Further back, by a long period,

the wolf takes up the story, and tells us, so far, comparatively little. But the

bed of tho old river which made the cave before the wolf haunted it should
tell us a story which may fairly rival in interest any of the annals of cave-

history.

The Committee are again indebted for kind assistance to Prof. Leith Adams

and Mr. William Davies, of the British Museum.

   I have gone over the Victoria collection as well as time would allow ; but
having been mostly out of town for some time, I have not been able to com-
plete the task as fully as I should have wished, and have left a few doubtful
specimens for further determination.

  A large part of the collection consists of broken splinters and fragments,

apparently mostly of bones of the Ox and Deer, and some probably of Rhi-

--noceros from their thickness. Of about 180 determined specimens, about

46 belong to Bos of two distinct sizes one probably being Bos primigenius,
and the other, I should imagine, B. longifrons ; amongst these are a few that

--appear to be comparatively recent. The next in frequency are teeth and

bones of Ursus so far as 1 can perceive, U. ferox. Amongst these are somo
indicating an individual or individuals of very large size ; whilst others would
indicate a form not larger than U. arctos. Some of the upper molars are very
much like those of U. spelceus ; but there is no clear indication of that species,
and most of the teeth and bones are undoubtedly those of U. ferox fossilis.

   Next comes Ilycena spelcea, with 30 specimens, which call for no remark,
except that they show individuals of various ages, as usual.
--218 REPORT 187/.

   Rhinoceros is represented by at least eleven well-marked specimens, all of

which, are in my mind, clearly referable to R. hemitcechus. They are mostly

teeth, but there is one well-marked fragment of a metatarsal.
    I have noticed only three or four fragments of a molar of Elephas antiquus.
   Fourteen specimens belong to Cervus elephas, though it is not impossible

that some of the teeth may belong to C. tarandus ; but there is no clear

indication of that species.

  A small ruminant, probably a Goat, is represented by sixteen specimens,

some of which appear to be comparatively recent.
   The Badger affords seven or eight specimens, mostly of teeth, and the Fox

five or six teeth and bones.

    Three or four specimens, but not very good ones, indicate the presence of
a Wolf of small size, but not, I think, a Dog.

    Besides these are bones of the Hare, and perhaps Babbit, several Birds,

Arvicola, &c, which I will examine when more at leisure.

                            Postscript. By the Reporter.

   In the Report for 1876 reference was made to the existence of Goats' bones
in the cave, to all appearance in the hyasna-bed, one of them bearing marks
which could only be referred to human agency : but it was thought that, as
many geologists and osteologists are of opinion that these animals were intro-
duced into Europe at times not earlier than the Neolithic age, the matter
could not be fully and fairly discussed without further and careful considera-
tion. Your reporter, noticing that in some of the Belgian bone-caves Goats
had been discovered with the remains of extinct Pleistocene animals, and
reported on by Monsieur E. Dupont, the distinguished cave-explorer, wrote
to him to inquire whether he was still of the same opinion that they were

--contemporaries. The result, so far as M. Dupont's opinion goes and it is
--one of deserved weights is strongly in tho affirmative ; but as his answer was

not received until after the Association Meeting, the matter was not discussed

in the Report. Your reporter now offers these remarks on his own respon-

sibility.

   M. Dupont writes as follows :

                                                                                               "Bruxelles, le 24 aout, 1877.

   Goats' bones appear to be not uncommon in the hyaena-layer ; and an
obvious inference by those who disbelieve in the antiquity of that species is
that they have fallen from the upper beds of the Roman or Neolithic layer,
and become accidentally mixed with an older fauna. But our method of
working precludes such a supposition. The upper beds had been well worked
away some time before these bones were uncovered, and no such accident
could therefore arise. One rib of a small ruminant from the Iryaena-bed, with

artificial marks upon it (No. ~\, has been already mentioned in the Report

for 1875, p. 173.

-- ^--On the 2nd of May, 1876, another bone a small humerus, No.  was

found, bearing very evident tool-marks. It occurred in Parallol 17, at

17 feet right of the datum line and at a depth from the original surface

--of 15 feet. The marks are very clean cuts, as if made by a sharp instrument
   so sharp, indeed, as almost to suggest that they may have been done with a
metallic tool. The cuts, however, have evidently not been made subsequently

to the discovery of the bone ; for the surfaces therein exposed are of the
same colour and have the same dark and ochreous staining and incrustation
as the general surface of the bone. Its occurrence, moreover, at the depth
of 15 feet in the hyaena-layer, surrounded by bones and teeth of the hyaena,
bear, elephant, and rhinoceros, precludes us from assigning to it a modern
origin in spite of the sharp nature of the cuts. The heel of a milk-tooth of

ElepJias antiquus was found within six inches of it. It may be a question
whether a sharp flint-flake, properly hafted, may not be capable of producing

in a bone of a freshly-slaughtered animal marks similar to these. In the
absence of Prof. Busk it was forwarded to Mr. William Davies, of the British

--Museum, and he pronounced upon it as follows : The humerus " is that of
220 report-- 1877.

a very small goat, but evidently of an adult. It is smaller than the humerus

of a true Shetland sheep with which I compared it, and besides the narrower

fossa, which you refer to, there are other points in which it differs from the

same bono in the sheep." Mr. Davies goes on to remark on the state of pre-

servation of the bone, which leads him to think it must be of comparatively

recent age. This, however, is the common condition of bones from the clay

of the Victoria Cave, and has been already mentioned in a previous report *.

Dr. Buckland found this also to be the case with bones of equal antiquity in

Kirkdale Cave, which in many ways is comparable with the Victoria Cave. In

this case he proved by experiments that " nearly the whole of their original

gelatine has been preserved ;" and cites other instances of preservation in

Westiff clay f.  cannot, therefore, take the condition of this bone to be any

evidence against its antiquity, but rather the reverse ; for, as a rule, the

chief parts of the bones in the upper beds in the cave are much decayed.

The actual finding of remains of man or his works in the cave is, after all,

a matter of little importance. It would, at most, only give completeness in

this particular instance to the picture of the life of the period. That the

fauna found there in beds beneath the glacial clay at the entrance was con-

temporary with man in other parts of Britain and Europe, is generally

admitted without dispute. If there were an absence of evidence of his pre-

sence in the North of England at this time, it could not in any way invalidate

the proofs of his coexistence with the same fauna, and presumably at the

samo time, in the South of England in days before the last great advance of

cold conditions in the North J.

   Major-General Strachey, F.R.S., Captain Douglas Gaxton,
   F.R.S., Mr. G. F. Deacon, Mr. Rogers Field, Mr. E. Roberts,

    Britain, ivith a view to its establishment on a surer foundation
    than hitherto.

This Committee was appointed in 1875 at the Bristol Meeting to inquire into
some uncertainties (alleged to exist by Mr. J. N. Shoolbred in his communi-
cation to the Association " On the Half-Tide Level at Liverpool ") as to the
exact position of the Datum Level of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain.

   It may be prefaced that the Ordnance datum is described in the 'Abstract

--of Levelling in England and Wales,' 1861, as follows: "The datum level

for Great Britain is the level of mean tide at Liverpool, as determined by our
own observations ; it is -^ of an inch above the mean tidal level obtained

from the records of the self-recording tide-gauge on the St. George's Pier,

Liverpool."

   The level of the sill (long ago removed) of the Old Dock at Liverpool
is the datum to which the records in question of the gauge on the St.

George's Pier are referred. Being consequently the lovel to which the

Ordnanco Datum is referred, it is therefore of the greatest importance

that its exact position should be clearly determined ; and the primary object

of this Committee is to set at rest the doubts which have hitherto existed on

the subject.

The uncertainties appear to have arisen from the following causes :

   (1) The difference between the levels given in the Ordnance Book of Levels
('Abstract of Levelling in England and Wales,' with plates, 1861) and in

the tracings of original levelling in Liverpool in 1843-44, sheet 29, as sup-

plied by the Ordnance Department to the Borough Engineer's Office,

Liverpool.

   (2) The existence in Liverpool of two gauges, each purporting to be a re-
production of the Old Dock sill.

   (3) A published statement under the authority of the Mersey Docks and

Harbour Board as to the position of the Ordnance Datum with reference to

the Old Dock sill.

1. («) 'Abstract of Levelling in England and Wales.'

VAt page of this book occurs the above-quoted definition of the Ordnance

Datum                                   and at page 2, in the list of levels, we find " Zero of the Tide-Gauge
                                     ;

at George's Ferry Basin, near George's Baths, Liverpool. Altitude in feet

--above Mean Level of the Sea at Liverpool 4-670 ;" a minus sign ( ) should

evidently have been prefixed to this level, as the zero of the tide-gauge was

below, not above, the mean sea-level. The zero of the tide-gauge was re-

garded as identical with that of the Old Dock sill ; and, judging from the

remarks on page 599 of the same volume, it was assumed to be so by the

Ordnance Department.

These remarks* begin by saying that the mean-water datum plane depends

upon the observations taken by the Ordnance Department in 1844. Then

follows a statement showing that the Department were in possession of

the records of the self-registering gauge for four years, from 1854 to
1857, and that the mean water during that period was 4-968 feet above the

level of the Old Dock sill. Notwithstanding this fact, recourse was had (as

is stated further on) to the tidal curves traced by the self-registering gauge

between May 13th and June 14th, 1859 (one month) ; the mean water of

which period is there announced as the true mean water at Liverpool,

and that it differs but 0-068 foot (the -fa of an inch of the definition) from

the assumed Orduance Datum plane.

The statement in the definition, " the mean tidal level obtained from the

records of the self-recording tide-gauge," without any qualification as to the

time during which the records were taken, might therefore be misappre-

hended, as it only refers to the mean obtained from one month's observa-

tions, and is not borne out by the records taken over longer periods.
   The tidal curves, moreover, shown under the head of " Liverpool " in the

volume of Plates issued with the Book of Levelling above named, would natu-

rally be supposed to be those taken by the Ordnance Department for deter-
mining the mean level of the sea. The letter of Lieut.-Col. Clarke, B.E.,

Ordnance Department, Southampton, sent to the Secretary of this Committee,

shows, however, that such is not the caset.

(b) Tracings of original levelling in Liverpool, 1843-44, sheet 29 (as supplied

to tho Borough Engineer's Office, Liverpool, by the Ordnance Department).

   On this sheet, at a point near to the S.E. corner of the Canning Dock (the

--site of a gauge purporting to be a reproduction of the Old Dock sill), the fol-

lowing remark occurs : " 17'8 Bottom of 22nd figure on gauge." By exa-

mination of this gauge it appears that this would give 4*20 feet as the height

of the Ordnance Datum above the zero of the Old Dock sill. Tet on page 2

of the 'Abstract of Levelling' above quoted, the difference is given as 4- 67
feet. Both levels cannot, of course, be correct.

    The Liverpool Borough Engineer's Office had ever since 1847, when the

above tracings were supplied, observed the 4-20 feet difference for the levels
throughout the town ; while the Waterworks Office (until lately distinct from

the former, though now combined with it) had made use of the 4-67 feet
difference. It may here also be remarked (as will be seen further on) that
the Engineer's Department of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made
use of and published 5 feet as the difference between the Ordnance Datum and

the Old Dock sill level.
    2. The existence of the two gauges, each purporting to be referred to the Old

Dock sill.

   A few words as to the history of the Old Dock sill may not here appear

inappropriate.

    The Old Dock at Liverpool (whence the Old Dock sill datum takes
its name) was opened on August 31st, 1715, and closed on August 31st,
1826. During this interval a " Dry Dock " had been added on the river
side of the " Old Dock." This dock having been altered into a wet dock,
and opened on December 12th, 1829, the level of the Old Dock sill, thence-
forward covered with water, was transferred to the S.E. corner of the new
dock ; in 1832 this new dock assumed the name of the " Canning Dock." It

was subsequently enlarged and reopened on May 9th, 1842. During this

operation the Old Dock sill gauge must have been temporarily removed else-
where, since the present eastern wall (near to the S.E. corner of which this
gauge now stands) is considerably further inland than was the eastern wall
of the " Dry Dock " against which it formerly stood.

    In 1844 the approaches to the Canning Dock, having been enlarged, were
opened under the name of the Canning Half-tide Dock, the two entrances
from the river having between them the " Canning Island." To the river-
face of this " Canning Island " was also transferred the level of the Old Dock
sill by Mr. John B. Hartley, the Engineer to the Liverpool Dock Committee,
and subsequently to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Captain Graham
H. Hills, B.N., the present Marine Surveyor to the Mersey Docks and
Harbour Board, was informed in 1861, by Mr. J. B. Hartley, that this was
the only trustworthy tide-gauge, as representing the Old Dock sill one. This
gauge is placed in a conspicuous position facing the river, with the following
heading in large letters over it, " Tidal datum, as transferred in 1843 from
the Old Dock sill ;" while the gauge at the S.E. corner of the Canning Dock
(which must have been re-transferred there when the dock was enlarged, and
during which process the error might have occurred) is placed unostentatiously
in an obscure corner, where its existence is almost forgotten.

  A series of check-levels*, taken under the direction of Mr. G. P. Deacon

of Liverpool, whose attention was naturally drawn to the anomaly in 1871,
when the Borough Engineer's and the Waterworks Departments were both
placed under his charge, show that the zero of the Old Dock sill gauge at the
Canning Island (the prominent one) is 4# 66 feet below the Ordnance Datum
(thus conciding nearly with the 4-67 feet of the Ordnance Book of Levels);

   3. Published statement of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.
    In an annual printed statement issued by this body there is given,
among other matters, information as to the " Levels of Tides at Liverpool " *.
This has been issued regularly for some years past. At the commencement,
and for some time after, the " mean-tide level " was there given as " 4 ft. 9 in.
above the Old Dock sill." Towards the end of 1853 the self-registering
tide-gauge was established. In 1864 the information derived from the ten
completed years' observations (1854-63) of the self-registering gauge was
tabulated, and the " Levels of Tides " were henceforth given as " derived "
from that information. In this amended form the " mean-tide level " became
" 5 feet above 0. D. S " (in lieu of the previous 4 ft. 9 in.). This informa-
tion continued exactly in this form for some years, until in 1871 the words
" (Ordnance- Datum) " were inserted after the " mean-tide level " and before

the "5 feet"f.
   But the Ordnance Datum (as stated at p. 599 of the 'Abstract of Level-

ling,' see Appendix) depends upon tidal observations taken by the Ordnance
Department in March 1844 ; and it has therefore nothing whatever to do
with the 1854-63 observations of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.

    Another very erroneous view of the Ordnance Datum, but one which hardly

needs consideration in order to dispel it, is, that it continues to represent the

mean tidal level at Liverpool. The mere mention of the facts that in 1844
the Ordnance Department considered the mean sea-level at that port to be
4-67 feet above the Old Dock sill, while the records of the self- registering tide-
gauge from 1854-63 give it as 5-01 feetj above that datum, and that the
records of the succeeding decade, 1864-73, show it to have stood during
that period at 5*24 feet over the same datum, clearly points out that the
moan sea-level, at Liverpool at least, is a varying one, and therefore cannot
now represent the Ordnance Datum.

   In conclusion, the Committee are of opinion :

   1st. That of the two tide-gauges at Liverpool, now purporting to be
referred to the level of the Old Dock sill, the zero of that fixed at the
S.E. corner of the Canning Dock is about 5-54 inches above the zero of that

on the river-face of the Canning Island, Liverpool.
   2nd. That in order to reconcile the statement in the Ordnance Book

of Levelling, that "the Datum Level for Great Britain is -f^ of an inch
above the mean tidal level obtained from the records of the self-recording

tide-gauge on the St. George's Pier, Liverpool," with the actual facts which
the Committee have collected, it is necessary to bear in mind that the records
of the self-recording gauge referred to were the observations of one month

only taken in the year 1859, and that the mean tidal level of that month
was 6-26 inches below the mean of the period from 1854 to 1873, taken by
the same self-recording gauge.

    3rd. That the difference of level between the Old Dock sill and the Ord-
nance Datum, given in the Ordnance Book of Levelling as 4-67 feet, is
correct on the assumption that the zero of the gauge on the river-face of tho

Canning Island, and not that of the gauge in the Canning Dock, be taken as the
correct level of the Old Dock sill ; and that, as is stated in the Ordnance

Book of Levelling, the Ordnance Datum be taken at T8^ of an inch above the
mean tidal level of the month of May 13 to June 14, 1859, as ascertained

by the self-recording tide-gauge of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.

   4th. It is thus apparent that the Ordnance Datum is an entirely arbitrary

level, which could not be again obtained from tidal observations.
   The Committee have further thought it advisable to take advantage of

the present inquiry in order to obtain information as to some of the various
local datum-marks in use in the British Isles, and to endeavour to ascer-
tain the difference of each relatively to the Ordnance Datum, which would
thus become a means of comparison between them. In order to enable
the Committee to carry out this work, they request to be reappointed.

                                                 Tidal Observations.

   This assumed mean water at Liverpool is the same imaginary plane to
which all the heights in the preceding pages are referred. It depends upon
tidal observations taken by this Department in March 1844. The error,
however, is very small, as appears from the results shown by the self-

registering tide-gauge at that Port.

   The Tide-gauge at Liverpool in connection with the self-registering
gauge is divided from zero in both directions. The zero corresponds with
the level of the Old Dock sill.

   By taking the annual means of H.W. and L.W. of self-registering gauge,

{1854,  15-424 above zero.  f 1854, 5-544 below zero.

1855,15-425  ,,             ^^^'wlM LI 1855, 5-570  ,,
1856,15-515  ,,                        1856,5-449

1857,15-478  ,,                      [1857,5-532

  +These results are remarkably close, and give 15-460 as the mean of

--H.W. for four years and 5-524 as that of L.W. for the same period. If

we assume the mean of these to represent mean water, we should have
4-4*968 as the reading of mean water. Mean water is, however, strictly
speaking, not the mean of H.W. and L.W., but the mean of all heights re-

corded at indefinitely small intervals, and for as long a period as possible.

  An examination of the curves traced by self-registering gauges, even

for one month or less, affords an accurate means of determining the mean
height, inasmuch as we can measuro the heights at any intervals of time as
small as we please. By this means we find from the curves traced between

May 13th, 1859, to June 14th, 1859, that the true mean water at Liverpool

reads 4-602 above the zero of the gauge. Now, by levelling, it appears that

this zero is 4-670 feet (see page 2) below our assumed plane of difference.

Consequently the true mean water at Liverpool is 0-068 foot below our as-
sumed plane of reference.

   If, therefore, we woidd strictly refer our heights to mean water at Liver-
pool, we should increase every quantity in the preceding pages by 0*068

foot,

The tidal observations taken at Liverpool in 1844, by which the mean level

of the sea at that port was determined, have never been published.

The curves shown in the volumo of Plates of the initial levelling for Liver-

pool are those of the self-registering tide-gauge for a selected period.

   I do not think that Mr. Shoolbred has noticed page 599 of the volume of

levelling*. I do not get mean tide by the formula L(high + low). And I

used one month of the self-registering tide-gauge, viz. May 13 to June 14, 1859.

--Sir, In answer to your letter to Colonel Bayley of May 3rd, which he

has referred to me, I beg to say that the height of " bottom of 22nd figure on

gauge" is not 22-00, but 22-265, which gives 22-265 -17'8= 4-46 (date of

Jris determination 1843) against the 4-67 (determined in 1857).

    I cannot explain this discrepancy of 0-21 foot ; but it happens to corre-

spond to some extent with the change you have observed in the mean tide.

                                            Yours truly,

--My Dear Sir, Perhaps the enclosed diagram may help to clear up the

mystery of the Ordnance Datum. The 22-265 feet has been measured

(twice, I believe) from the surface of the stone to the lower edge of XXII.

Ferry). There is no uncertainty whatever about our datum.

the 4-67 referred to different gauges.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Prof. Huxley, Dr. Carpenter,

   Mr. Sclater, Mr. F. M. Balfour, Dr. M. Foster, Prof. E. Ray

   Lankester, and Mr. Dew-Smith, appointed for the purpose of

   arranging with Dr. Dohrn for the occupation of a Table at the

    Zoological Station at Naples.

The duty of your Committee seems not so much to report on the Zoolo-
gical Station itself, which is now fully established and equipped, as to select

fitting naturalists to proceed to Naples, and to occupy the Table engaged for

the British Association.

Since the last report was made, three naturalists have occupied this Table,

viz. Dr. "W. B. Carpenter, F.R.S., Mr. Francis M. Balfour, and Mr. Arthur

W. Waters.

These gentlemen are required by the Association to report the result of

Wetheir work there. These reports will be found appended.                                                                                                               may say

that the Institution is now thoroughly well established and is daily becoming

an Institution of world-wide reputation.

                                                                                                                                                                                   I
             ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  229

Tables have been engaged by most of the Continental Governments, and

many of the most eminent living naturalists have availed themselves of its

advantages.

Your Committee would most strongly urgo the desirability of renewing

the grant, as such an Institution necessarily requires annual support, as it is

in no way subsidized.

Deae Sie,

   As I attended in person last year both at the Sectional Committee and at

the Committee of Pecommondations, and made a verbal report of my ex-

periences at the Naples Zoological Station, on the strength of which the vote

was passed without any difficulty, I do not see what more I have now to say.

I found the arrangements entirely satisfactory ; every facility being given

in the supply of animals, the keeping them alive in special tanks, and tho

provision of apparatus, reagents, &c. for scientific investigation. And I

hope in the course of the next year, by means of tho information and

material I there obtained, to complete my Memoir on Antedon (Comatula).
   It seems to me that the continuance of the grant should rather be decided

by its results during the last year.

   I am sorry that I shall not be able to be at the Meeting of the British

Association at Plymouth, as I had intended. The depressed state of health

--in which I am at present partly depending on the severe bereavements I

have sustained, and partly on the excessive wear and tear of official duties

makes it necessary for me to devote my vacation to bodily and mental re-

freshment.              Yours sincerely,
                                  William B. Cakpenter.

Report by Mr. Francis M. Balfour, on the Zoological Station

                                              at Naples.

   In accordance with the Regulations of the Committee appointed to report
on the Zoological Station at Naples, I have the honour to lay before you the

following.

  I reached Naples on June 5th, and having given previous notice of my

intended arrival, found every thing prepared for mo.

  My objoct in going to Naples was to work out tho development of Amphloxus,

and also to complete my researches on the development and anatomy of
Elasmobranch fishes. An ample supply of Amphioxus was provided for mo

every morning ; and since with a fair supply of fresh sea-water those animals

live in a healthy condition, I had a continually increasing stock of them on

hand. For the most part I kept them in small aquaria, which were daily

Aexamined to seo if ova had been deposited.  considerable number of

animals were also placed in one of the large tanks of the Aquarium, which
230 report--1877.

was most liberally cleaned out for my special use. From time to time a

surface-net was dragged through the tank with the hope of finding larva?.

In addition to these means of obtaining embryos I also employed the surface-

net in those parts of the bay in which Amphioxus usually lives. All these

means unfortunately proved ineffectual, and I failed to obtain any larvae of

Amphioxus                                                     this was  probably owing to the lateness of the season, since
                                                           ;

at the time I left Naples (July 1st) the majority of examples of Amphioxus

were filled either with spermatozoa or ova. In any case the Zoological

Station, so far from being in any way responsible for my failure, furnished

me in a much more ample manner with all I required than any private in-

dividual could possibly have done for himself.

  My researches on Elasmobranch fishes proved more fortunate. I obtained

an ample supply of material, which I was partly able to investigate at Naples

and partly to preserve for further study in England.

I ma)- perhaps also be permitted to add a few words with reference to the

present condition of the Station. Since the summer of 1875, when I last

worked at Naples, considerable improvement has been effected in many of

Athe departments.                                             carefully determined collection of the animals of the

bay has been commenced, and has already attained considerable dimensions.

The department for supplying naturalists and museums with preserved

specimens has now been fully organized ; and I can answer for the very

beautiful manner in which the specimens are preserved, under the direction

of Dr. H. Midler, who has charge of the department.

The library has been steadily, not to say rapidly, increasing, and in most

departments is fairly well supplied. There is still, however, a slight

deficiency in systematic works. The greatest addition, however, has been

made in the fishing department. Through the munificence of the Berlin

Academy, Dr. Dohrn has been enabled to procure a steam launch made by

Messrs. Thornycroft, of Chiswick, and specially designed for marine research.

By means of this the area of fishing will be enormously extended, and will now

include the adjoining bays of Salerno and Gaeta. It scarcely requires to be

pointed out how greatly this will increase tho number of forms to be procured

as well as the constancy of the supply.

In conclusion, I would bear testimony to tbe unceasing kindness and

willingness to assist naturalists displayed by the acting director, Dr. Hugo

Eisig, and would strongly urge the desirability of renewing the grant of the

Association.

Dear Str,

   I promised to send you word as to the use I had made of the table at the

Naples Zoological station, wbich was granted me by the British Association.
   The pressure of business has prevented me from having any paper ready

for the Glasgow meeting this year, but as far I can find time I shall still
go on with the determination of the material I collected.

   I took up the systematic study of the Bryozoa with the intention of com-
paring them with the Tertiary fossil forms from Italy, which I have from

various horizons of the Tertiaries.

   I have now determined fifty known species collected at Naples, and expect
the number will be considerably added to, though I do not suppose I shall

                                                                                                                             I
REPORT OE THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.  231

find as many species as I at one time expected, as by study I shall find
specimens which I thought different to be tho same species. Concerning new

species I cannot form any idea until the completion of my work of deter-

mination.

    I found tho arrangements of the institution were thoroughly well adapted
for any one wishing to follow up the systematic study of any group of smaller
animals. 1 have already called attention in one or two places to the library,

Avhich although very good for embryology, is not at all satisfactory for those

who wish to determine the fauna or flora on the spot, and it is to be hoped
that it will receive such additions from authors as will make it much more

complete.

   I have also said that I should advise any naturalist who intends to study
there, to previously obtain the catalogue that he may know what books that

he is in the habit of using ho had better bring with him.

    After using the British Association table I became connected with the

institution for a short time, and made a beginning for a museum by putting

aside specimens from various groups for this purpose. Dr. Dohrn's report
will probably give latest particulars as to what has been done in this direc-
tion. At the time that I left a good number of Crustacea, Tunicata, and other
animals had been determined by Prof. Heller and others, and I completed a
Catalogue of all the Echinodermata in the collection, which I had given some

study to during my stay.
   My experience gained during tho few months I was in Naples makes me

say in the most emphatic manner that this is a most useful institution, and if
there are (as there doubtless always will be) zoologists who are anxious to
avail themselves of it, then the grant of £75 by the British Association is
one which it is to be hoped, in the interest of science, they will continue.

                       Yours truly,

                              Arthur War. Waters.

Report of the Anthropometric Committee, consisting of Dr. Beddoe,

   Lord Aberdare, Dr. Farr, Mr. Francis Galton, Sir Henry
   Rawlinson, Colonel Lane Fox, Sir Rawson Rawson, Mr. James

    Heywood, Dr. Mouat, Professor Rolleston, Mr. Hallett, Mr.
   Fellows, and Professor Leone Levi.

The Committee has met six times since tho last general meeting at Glasgow.
The following new members have been added to the Committee, viz. Dr.

Lawson, Dr. Mouat, Capt. Dillon, and Mr. lledgrave.

  A report on measurements of the 2nd ltoyal Surrey Militia at Guildford

by Col. A. Lane Fox has been received, and has been published in the ' Jour-

nal of the Anthropological Institute ; ' a hundred copies of this paper have
been retaiued for the use of the Committee.

    Schedules of measurements filled in by Dr. Farr, Mr. Redgrave, and other
observers have also been received by the Committee.
--233 Heport 1877.

   Mr. E. W. Brabook made a proposal to the Committee for carrying out the

provisions of the vote of the Association in relation to typical photographs,

and fifty copies have been printed in pamphlet form for the use of the Com-

mittee.

  A series of photographs of natives taken at tho Straits Settlements have

been submitted by Mr. Francis Galton.
   The results of the communications received and the measurements which

have been taken have shown that more detailed instructions are necessary to
enable the various observers to conduct their measurements upon a uniform
plan, without which the returns are misleading, and the printed instructions
have been modified accordingly.

   With a view further to ensure uniformity in returning the colour of the
hair and defining the terms to be employed in the descriptions, ton litho-
graphed patterns of hair-colours corresponding to some of those used in M.
Broca's tables have been printed, and three hundred copies havo been bound
up for distribution to the collectors of the statistics.

    Coxeter's spirometer having been found too small to record tho breathing
capacity of large men, measures have been taken to ensure tho improvement

of the instrument. An additional set of instruments for measuring height,

weight, and strength of arm have been obtained from Messrs. Tisley and

Spiller, opticians.

    It being the opinion of the Committee, as the result of their examination
of the measurements already received, that the necessary uniformity is not
likely to be obtained without trained observers, measures havo been taken to

secure the services of a non-commissioned officer of the army, by whom it is

proposed to promulgate a uniform system of measurement in different localities.
The arrangements for carrying out this experiment are still in progress.

    Although the Committee has not yet obtained sufficient data to enable
generalization to be formed, it is thought that the necessary preliminaries have
been taken to secure accuracy, and that the measurements taken under the

new instructions may be relied upon.

Report on the Conditions under which Liquid Carbonic Acid exists in

      Rocks and Minerals, by a Committee consisting of Walter Noel
       Hartley, F.R.S.E.,E. J. Mills,D.Sc.,F.R.S.,«^W. Chandler
      Roberts, F.R.S. Brawn up by W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.E.

In a paper read before the Chemical Section of the British Association at the
 Glasgow Meeting, I described the method of determining the exact tempera-
 ture at which the carbonic acid which is sometimes found enclosed in the
 cavities of rocks and minerals becomes gaseous. This temperature is called
by Prof. Andrews the critical point, and has been determined by him, in the
 case of carbonic acid in as pure a state as it could be procured artificially, to
 bo 30°-92 C.

    The following Table shows the critical point of the carbonic acid enclosed
in various minerals, and certain variations are apparent which may be
 accounted for, when the critical point is below the normal temperature, by
 the carbonic acid being mixed with some incondensible gas like nitrogen.

It seemed to be very desirable to ascertain whether the presence of liquid

carbonic acid in rocks was not of frequent occurrence, whether, in fact, the

immense number of minute cavities dispersed through quartzite, granites,

and porphyries, which are usually cousidered as containing water, may not

often contain liquid carbonic acid, or whether the occurrence of liquid car-

bonic acid in rocks might not be characteristic of certain formations.

 --Method of Working, Sfc. The microscopic observations of Bryson on the

quartz porphyry of Arran, also of Zirkel on Labradorito, tend to show that

if some means could be devised of readily recognizing minute quantities of

this substance it would be frequently met with. The apparatus shown at

the last meeting of the British Association was made use of. Its action

raises the temperature of the specimen under examination to above the

critical point of carbonic acid, and but for a single instant of time only if

desirable. So marked is the change in appearance of cavities containing

liquid carbonic acid when a current of warm air is blown upon them, that a

^^layer of carbonic acid no larger than  of an inch in diameter may bo

detected.

It has been necessary to examine a great variety of rocks, and very thin

cctions have been cut from about two hundred different specimens during

the past year. These were polished but not covered with a thin glass, be-

Acause a better examination may be made with high microscopic powers.

^-inch object-glass was made by Messrs. R. and J. Beck, after the pattern of

one made according to Mr. Sorby's directions. Its definition is perfect at

Aany depth in a reasonably well-cut rock-section.  considerable number of

minerals were examined, including about 30 sapphires, a like number of

zircons, 60 garnets from the Cape of Good Hope, several topazes and sec-

tions of fluor-spar, sulphate of baryta, and arksutite (a fluoride of aluminium,

calcium, and sodium) from Greenland.

 --Motion of bubbles in fluid-cavities under the influence of heat. Incidentally

this inquiry has led to the discovery of curious facts concerning the motion

of the bubbles in fluid-cavities when influenced by a source of heat. An

extensive scries of experiments were made, the details of which are fully
234 report--1877.

recorded in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. The following is the
summary of this part of the research :

   " 1st. The bubbles in certaiu fluid- cavities approach a source of heat
which is brought near them.

   "2nd. The bubbles in certain fluid-cavities recede from the same source

of heat.

   " 3rd. That a rise of 5° C. above the temperature of the specimen suffices

to cause the apparent attraction.

   " 4th. Tbat a rise of only ^° C. will in some cases cause the apparent re-

pulsion.

   " 5th. That in certain cases a bubble which receded from the source of

heat at ordinary temperatures approached it when raised to 60° C, the

source of heat always being from J° C. to 5° C. warmer than the specimen.
    " 6th. That this could occur in cavities containing liquid carbonic acid as

well as water, but that it made no difference whether the carbonic acid was

raised above its critical point or not."                                «

This latter fact affords a means of controlling to some extent the conditions

of the experiment, since we know that the tension of liquid carbonic acid

when it has just passed the critical point amounts to 109 atmospheres.

Hence gas-bubbles enclosed in minute tubes containing water may be

caused to recede from or approach a source of heat according as their tempe-

rature is below or above 60° C, and even when the gas is confined under
enormous pressure. It was found that the warmth of the fingers is sufficient

to propel even in a vertical direction a plug of water contained in a capillary
tube open at both ends. The apparent attraction of bubbles by heat is evi-
dently due to the same cause which occasions this movement. Professor
Stokes assigns this apparent repulsion of the liquid to a diminution by heat
of the surface-tension at one end of a plug of liquid in a tube, or side of a,

bubble in a cavity.

   When attraction of the liquid takes place it may be because a slight rise

of temperature effects a disengagement of gas from the water on the side of
the bubble nearest to the source of heat, which increases the surface-tension

at this side : the bubble is therefore propelled in the opposite direction.

   This explanation is similar to that which Professor James Thomson gave

of the cause of the " tears of wine," published in the Reports of the British

Association (1855, Proceedings of Sections, p. 16).

  --On vibrating bubbles and the Brownian movement. Mr. Sorby was the first

to notice a remarkable vibration of minute bubbles in the fluid-cavities of
minerals precisely of the nature of tho Brownian movement.

   This motion was repeatedly seen in some sections of granites, as, for

instance, many specimens from Cornwall, quartzite from Snowdon, and

granite from Shap Fell in "Westmoreland. All the most minute cavities
contain bubbles incessantly vibrating. It was found that all these bubbles

approached a warm body, and that they ceased moving and clung for some

time to the warmer side of a cavity. After repeated and varied experiments
on these moving bubbles the following conclusion was arrived at. It is
impossible to imagine a body which is not gaining or losing, or, at the same
time, both gaining and losing heat ; it is therefore impossible to imagine it

entirely throughout at a uniform temperature. It is evident, then, that an
easily movable particle which can be set in motion by exceedingly slight

rises of temperature will make the transference of heat from one point to
another plainly visible. The minute bubbles in fluid-cavities are such par-

tides, and these vibratory motions afford an ocular demonstration of the

continual passago of heat through solid substances.

  A further continuation of this research was extended to the conditions

under which minute solid particles exhibit the Brownian movement. It

was found that solid particles are subject to the same influences and behave

in the same way as minute bubbles, a fact which was anticipated. As to the

cause of tho movement there can be no doubt, since the very recent investi-

gations of M. Delsaulx of Louvain, on the thermodynamic origin of the

Brownian movement, lead to the samo conclusion ; but with regard to the

modus operandi of this cause it will be well to reserve further statements

until an cxbaustive study of JM. Delsaulx's views may warrant a decision.

-- General views concerning the. occurrence of liquid carbonic acid in minerals.
   Liquid carbonic acid is not of common occurrence in rocks and minerals,

although occasionally met with.

The critical point is rarely to be found exactly the same as that deter-

mined by Professor Andrews, and it ranges from 32° 0. in a sapphire to

21° C. in quartz.

The conditions of pressure under which the liquid carbonic acid exists are

very varied : thus, in some cases the quantity of liquid in proportion to gas
is so small that a rise of 5° or 6° C. above 16° causes it to disappear by eva-

poration. In other cases it may be made to expand and fill the cavity at or

about its critical point ; and in one instance, in the case of a piece of felstone

from Snowdon, it was found that tho liquid had expanded to the fullest
extent possible at so low a temperature as 18° C.

  --Continuity of the gaseous and liquid states of matter exemplified in certain

specimens. In other instances noticed in large cavities in a white topaz, the

liquid was in sufficient quantity to fill the cavity at 2° or 3° C. below its

critical point.

Under such circumstances when the liquid was completely converted into

gas it condensed on cooling ivitJiout undergoing any visible change.

   It may well be asked how the fact of this change of state was ascertained.

The following description of experiments will explain all.

In a section of a colourless oriental topaz containing a large number of

cavities, one of large size was easily studied with a magnifying-power of 40

Adiameters.      jet of warm air raised the liquid above its critical point.

After waiting for a minute, during which no change of any kind was seen in

the cavity, a very slight puff of warm air was directed on to the specimen,

and  immediately   a  crowd  of little  bubbles  made  their  appearance  in  its  centre
                                                                                                             ;

these instantly vanished, closed up in fact, but could be reproduced again

and allowed to disappear as rapidly and as often as one could desire. The

jet of air coidd be regulated so gently that only two or three bubbles were

formed. It is evident, then, that the cavity is completely filled with liquid.

When the jet of warm air was forcible no change was seen to take place, but

a gentle warmth no longer caused the formation of bubbles therefore the

cavity must have been filled with gas. It is evident, then, that in the first

case the gas had passed into the liquid state without breach of continuity,

and in the second the passage, in a reverse direction, from liquid to gas had

taken place in like manner.

Thus one sees beautiful illustrations in natural specimens of Professor

Andrews's famous law of continuity in the gaseous and liquid states of matter.

  --On the temperature of formation of rocks and minerals. Regarding the

proportions of gaseous and liquid carbonic acid, an important generalization

has been arrived at.
--236 report 1877.

    In rock-crystal, in arksutite, in felstone from Snowdon, and in some
topazes and beryls the carbonic acid is not contained in every cavity, though
water is seen in them all. In one topaz it was noticed that nearly all the
cavities contained merely a trace of water, but there was a sufficiency of
liquid carbonic acid to occupy two thirds of their capacity at 16° C. One or
two cavities, however, of large size were noticed which contained one third
water, one third gaseous and one third liquid carbonic acid. I believe, for

reasons I am about to state, that all these substances were formed by the

action of a temperature below 340° C. In sapphires, in tourmalines, and in
some other topazes the condition of things is different. Irregular though

the cavities may be, it is easy to see that they have about the same propor-

tion of gas, of liquid carbonic acid, and of water, and minute search shows
that there is not a single cavity which does not contain in some proportion
all of these substances. In a colourless and clear topaz there were discovered
thousands of perfectly cylindrical tube-like cavities, round at each end.
In the case of fifty-two cavities, as far as lineal measurement could decide,
they each contained the same proportions of carbonic acid liquid, carbonic
acid gas, and water. Hence at the time they were enclosed in the mine-
ral these fluids must have existed in the state of a homogeneous vapour.
This of necessity places the temperature of formation of the mineral some-
where above 342° C, the critical point of water. In other cases in which
the cavities differ in the nature of their contents, the water at the time of
the formation of the mineral must have been in the liquid state. It is pos-
sible to determine within certain limits the temperature which a rock or
mineral has endured (and that, too, very easily) if liquid carbonic acid is
found enclosed in it.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address by Professor G. Carey Poster, F.B.S., President of the Section.

When any one fears that lie lias accepted a duty that is too difficult for him, or

that he has allowed himself to be placed in a position, the responsibilities of which

are greater than he can properly discharge, probably the very worst thing he can

do is to proclaim his misgivings to the world. But though I fully believe in this

rather obvious maxim, I cannot avoid saying that I enter upon my duties here

to-day with very great diffidence, and that I feel the necessity of asking your in-

dulgence at the outset for what I fear will be my inevitable shortcomings in dis-
charging the functions of the honourable post that has been assigned to me. And
I am sure that no one who calls to mind the names of some of those who, within

--recent years, have occupied the chair of this Section, and who knows however
--imperfectly what those names stand for in connexion with Mathematics and

Physics, will be surprised that I should deprecate comparisons which might tend

to degenerate into contrasts, or that I should shrink from having my performances

measured by the standard of such predecessors. But I have neither the right nor
the desire to detain you longer with this purely personal topic, and 1 therefore
proceed to ask your attention to matters more closely connected with the business
which has brought ns here.

   The periodically recurring character of these meetings unavoidably suggests, at
each recurrence, a retrospect at the scientific work of the year, and an attempt to
estimate the advances which have been the result of this work. At first sight
nothing would seem to be more natural or appropriate than that each President of
a Section should occupy the introductory remarks, which the custom of the Asso-
ciation demands from him, with an account of the chief forward steps made during

the past year in the branches of science represented by his Section.

   Very little consideration, however, is sufficient to show that, in the case at

least of Section A, to give any thing like a general report of progress would be a

task which few, if any, men could perform single-handed. To say nothing of the
enormous amount of the material which is now the result of a year's scientific

-- --activity, the variety or I might even say the unlikeness of the subjects of which

this Section takes cognizance is so great that, in most cases, it would be safe to

conclude, from the mere fact of a man being able adequately to expound the recent
advances in one of these subjects, that he must have given so much attention to
this one as to have made it impossible for him to have followed carefully the pro-

gress of the rest.

  ABut even supposing that all Presidents of Section were able to discourse with

full and equal knowledge of hyper-Jacobian surfaces, the influence of temperature

on the capillary constant of dilute sulphuric acid, or the latest improvement in the

construction of aneroid harometers, some consideration would still be due to their
audience. And, long-suffering as British-Association audiences have often shown

themselves to be, there is no doubt that before a tenth part could be read of a
report on the year's work on the subjects included in this Section, the room would

be cleared and most of those who came to hear about Mathematics and Physics

woidd have gone to try whether they could not find in Section E or F something

appealing more directly to the common sympathies of mankind.

   But, although a serious report of progress would thus be both impossible and

unsuitable in the form of an Address to the Section, it remains none the less true

that such reports are in themselves of the utmost scientific value ; and, as has

been pointed out repeatedly, there are few ways in which the British Association
could more effectually fulfil its function of promoting the Advancement of Science
than by aiding in their preparation and publication. But when one tries to think

out in detail the way in which the Association could do this, the practical diffi-
culties of the scheme are seen to be neither few nor trifling. It may be sufficient
to point out that there is no evident reason why help of this kind should be afforded

to one branch of science rather than to another, and that the publication of reports

upon all branches would completely overtax the resources of the Association.
   In the case of some important sciences, however, the work of reporting recent

advances has already, with more or less of help from this Association, been
undertaken by other bodies ; thus there are the ' Abstracts ' published monthly

in the Journal of the Chemical Society, and there are the Zoological Record,

the Geological Record,  and  other publications  of  a  like nature                                              but hitherto
                                                                                                              ;

nothing of the kind has been done in this country for those departments of

science with which this Section is specially concerned. But without attempting

to commit the Association to any burdensome outlay, or to any larger scheme

than it would be practicable to carry out, it seems to me possible that a sys-

tematic series of reports might be established in connexion with this Section

which would have a very high value. In the early volumes of the British

Association's Transactions we find, more frequently than in recent ones, reports,

not merely on some special investigation, but on the recent progress and present

state of some more or less compreheusive branch of Science. Thus in the first four

volumes we find the following, among other reports, presented to this Section :
On the Progress of Astronomy, On the Present State of Meteorology, On the
Present State of the Science of Radiant Heat, On the Progress of Optics, On the
Magnetism of the Earth, On Capillary Attraction, On Physical Optics, On the

Recent Progress and Present Condition of the Mathematical Theories of Electricity,

Magnetism, and Heat. Now I venture to think that this form of the activity of

the Association might with great advantage be revived and systematized. I would

suggest, as a plan that seems to me worth consideration by the Committee of this

Section, the appointment of Committees charged to report to the Section periodi-

cally on the advances made in each of the chief departments of Science of which

we here take cognizance. For example, to confine my remarks to Physics, we

might have a Committee on Optics, a Committee on Acoustics, one on Heat, one

on Electricity, and so on. It would not be in accordance with the usages of the

Association to nominate these as standing Committees, but they might be made

virtually such by annual reappointment. I would suggest that they should not

report annually, but at intervals of perhaps five or six years, the times being so

arranged that different Committees should report in different years, the report in

each case being a systematic account of all the work of any importance done on
the subject and within the period to which it related. In order not to make the

work too heavy, it would probably be needful to make each Committee compara-

tively numerous, so that individual members might each undertake to report upon
some" limited part of the general subject. Some one member of each Committee

would also require to act as editor ; his function woidd be not merely to put

together the detached fragments sent in by his colleagues, but to distribute to

them the materials on which they would have to report. For this purpose it would

be needful that copies of all the important scientific periodicals relating to Physics

should be supplied to the Committee ; but, besides providing these and printing

the Reports, I do not see that the Association need be put to any expense ; and if

it were thought well to sell the Reports independently of the yearly volumes of

the Association, probably a good part even of this expense might be recovered.

    The mutual relations subsisting between the two great groups of sciences which
we discuss in this Section under the names Mathematics and Physics offer so many

deeply interesting points for consideration, that, at the risk of reminding you how

admirably aud with what fulness of knowledge the same subject has been treated

by more than one of my predecessors in this Chair, I venture to ask your attention

once more to a few remarks on this topic.

    The intimate connexion between Mathematics and Physics arises out of the fact

that all scientific knowledge of physical phenomena is based upon measurements--

--that is to say, upon the discovery of relations of number, quantity, and position of

the same kind as those which form the subject-matter of mathematics. It is true

that in studying physics we have to learn much about the quality of phenomena

and of the conditions under which they occur, as well as about their purely quan-

titative relations ; but even in the qualitative study of physical phenomena we
find it impossible to determine what is really characteristic and to distinguish the
essential from the accidental, except by the aid of measurements. In fact if we
take the most elementary treatise upon any branch of physics that we can meet
with (a book, it may be, which aims at giving a purely descriptive account of
phenomena), we find, when we examine it, that numberless careful measurements

have been required to establish the truth of the merely qualitative statements

which it contains. To take a simple and well-known example, the old question,
whether the ascent of water in a pump was due to the pressure of the atmosphere
or to Nature's horror of a vacuum, was not conclusively settled by Torricelli's di-
C3very that mercury would not rise beyond a certain height in a glass tube, even to
prevent a vacuum being formed at the top of it, for the same thing was already
known about the water in a pump. But when he measured the height of the

mercury column in his tube and found that, if he multiplied it by the speciiic
gravity of mercury, the product was equal to 32 feet, the height to which, as
Galileo said (probably between jest and earnest) nature's abhorrence of a vacuum

in a pump extended, it was clear that the ascent both of water and of mercury
depended upon the particular depth of each liquid that was needed to produce some
definite pressure ; and when Pascal had persuaded his brother-in-law to carry a
Torricelli's tube to the top of the Puy de Dome, and he had measured the height

of the mercury column at the top of the mountain as well as at the foot, the proof
was completed that the pressure which determined the height of both the water
and the mercury was the pressure of the atmosphere.

   Again, let us examine a still more familiar phenomenon, the falling of heavy

bodies to the ground. So long as we consider this merely under its general or,
as we may call them, its qualitative aspects, we might reasonably infer that it

is the result of some inherent tendency of bodies ; and, so far from its seeming

to be true, as stated in Newton's First Law of Motion, that bodies have no power

to alter their own condition of rest or of motion, we might infer that, however
indifferent they may be as regards horizontal motion, they have a distinct tendency
to move downwards whenever they can, and a distinct disinclination to move
upwards. But when we measure the direction in which bodies tend to fall [and

the amount of the tendency in different places, and find that these vary in the

way that they are known to do with geographical position and distance from the
sea-level, we are obliged to conclude that there is no inherent tendency to motion

at all, but that falling is the result of some mutual action exerted between the

earth and the falling body ; for if we suppose falling to be due to any internal cause,
we must imagine something much more complicated than a mere tendency to
motion in one direction, else how could a stone that has always fallen in one

direction in England fall in almost exactly the opposite direction as soon as it is

taken to New Zealand ?

   These two simple examples illustrate a principle that we meet with throughout

Physics, namely that, in the investigation of the causes of physical phenomena,
or, in other words, of the connexion between these phenomena and the conditions
under which they occur, the really decisive guidance is afforded by the study of
their measurable aspects.
4 REPORT 1877.

The consequence is that from the very outset of his investigations the physicist

has to rely constantly on the aid of the mathematician ; for, even in the simplest

cases, the direct results of his measuring operations are entirely without meaning

until they have been submitted to more or less of mathematical discussion. And

when in this way some interpretation of the experimental results has been arrived

at, and it has been proved that two or more physical quantities stand in a

definite relation to each other, the mathematician is very often able to infer, from

the existence of this relation, that the quantities in question also fulfil some other

relation that was previously unsuspected. Thus when Coulomb, combining the

functions of experimentalist and mathematician, had discovered the law of the

force exerted between two particles of electricity, it became a purely mathematical

problem, not requiring any further experiment, to ascertain how electricity is dis-

tributed upon a charged conductor ; and this problem has been solved by mathema-

ticians in several cases.

It thus happens that a very large part of our knowledge of physics is due in the

first instance to the mathematical discussion of previous results, and is experimental

only in the second or perhaps still more remote degree.

Another way in which the mathematician cooperates in the discovery of physical

truths is almost exactly the converse of that last mentioned. In very many cases t he

most obvious and direct experimental method of investigating a given problem is

extremely difficult or, for some reason or other, untrustworthy. In such cases the

mathematician can often point out some other problem more accessible to expeii-

mental treatment, the solution of which involves the solution of the former one.

For example, if we try to deduce from direct experiments the law according to

which one pole of a magnet attracts or repels a pole of another magnet, the

observed action is so much complicated with the effects of the mutual induction

of the magnets and of the forces due to the second pole of each magnet, that it

is next to impossible to obtain results of any great accuracy. Gauss, however,

showed how the law which applies in the case mentioned can be deduced from

the deflections undergone by a small suspended magnetic needle when it is acted

upon by a small fixed magnet placed successively in two determinate positions

relatively to the needle; and, being an experimentalist as well as a mathematician,

he showed likewise how these deflections can be measured very easily and with

great precision.

It thus appears not only that mathematical investigations have aided at every

step whereby the present stage in the development of a knowledge of physics has

been reached, but that mathematics has continually entered more and more into

the very substance of physics, or, as a physiologist might say, has been assimilated

by it to a greater and greater extent.

Another way of convincing ourselves how largely this process has gone on

would be to try to conceive the effect of some intellectual catastrophe, supposing

such a thing possible, whereby all knowledge of mathematics should be swept

away from men's minds. Would it not be that the departure of mathematics

would be the destruction of physics ? Objective physical phenomena would, indeed,

Weremain as they are now, but physical science would cease to exist.                                                                                                                                                  should no

doubt still see the same colours on looking into a spectroscope or polariscope, vibrating

strings would produce the same sounds, electrical machines would give sparks,

and galvanometer-needles would be deflected                                                                                                                                                                           but all these things would have lost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;
-- --their meaniug ; the)' would be but as the dry bones the disjecta membra of

what is now a living and growing science. To. follow this conception further, and

to try to image to ourselves in some detail what would be the kind of know-

ledge of physics which would remain possible supposing all mathematical

ideas to be blotted out, would be extremely interesting ; but it would lead us
directly into a dim and entangled region where the subjective seems to be always

passing itself off for the objective, and where I at least could not attempt to

lead the way, gladly as I would follow any one who could show where a firm

footing is to be found. But without venturing to do more than look from a safe
distance over this puzzling ground, we may see clearly enough that mathematics

is the connective tissue of physics, binding what would else be merely a list of

detached observations into an organized body of science.

In my opinion, however, it would be a very serious misconception to suppose that

on this account an elaborate apparatus of technical mathematics is in general

needful for the proper presentation of physical truths. The ladders and ropes of

formula} are no doubt often essential during- the building' up of a newly discovered

physical principle ; but the more thoroughly the building is finished, the more com-
pletely will these signs that it is still in progress be cleared away, and easy ascents be

provided to all parts of the edifice. In an address, delivered from the Chair of this

Section four years ago, Prof. Henry Smith quotes the saying of an old French

geometer, " that a mathematical theoiy was never to be considered complete till

you had made it so clear that you could explain it to the first man you met in the

street." Very likely Prof. Smith was right to call this " a brilliant exaggeration ; "
at any rate I know of no reason for disputing his opinion but I believe the exag-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

geration would really be very small if the dictum were applied to the theories of

physics instead of to those of pure mathematics. "When a physical principle or

theory is grasped with thorough clearness, I believe it is possible to explain it to

the man in the street (only he must not be hurrying to catch a train)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                and it would,

I think, be difficult to find a more wholesome maxim to be kept in mind by those of

us whose business it is to teach physics, than that we should never think we under-

believe he would find his mathematical discussions gain marvellously in freshness

aud vigour if he had once made up bis mind how he would treat his subject suppo-

sing all use of mathematical technicalities denied him.

   So far, in considering the mutual relations of Mathematics and Physics, I have

placed myself, as it was natural for me to do, at a physical point of view, and, starting

from the fact that the existence and progress of the latter science are essentially de-

pendent upon help derived from the former, I have tried to point out some of the

ways in which this help is rendered. If we turn now to inquire in what light the

relations between the two sciences appear from the side of mathematics, we find that

mathematicians are not slow to admit the advantages which their science derives

from contact with physics. It was a saying of Fourier that " a more attentive study
of nature is the most fruitful source of mathematical discoveries; " and Prof. Henry

Smith, in the Address I have already referred to, says that " probably by far the

larger part of the accessions to our mathematical knowledge have been obtained by

the efforts of mathematicians to solve the problems set to them by experiment."

We may perhaps regard such expressions as equivalent to the statement that the law

of inertia is not without application even to the mind of the mathematician, and that

it, too. continues to move in a straight line " except in so far as it may be compelled

by impressed forces " to change its direction                                                                                                                                                                                                or, to put the matter a little differently,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

--may we not look upon the fact as illustrating what is probably a general principle of

mental action namely, that the human mind has no more power to create an idea

than the hand has to create matter or energy, our seemingly most original conceptions

being in reality due to suggestions from without ? But however this may be, the
fact remains that the origin of many most important mathematical theorems and

even entire departments of mathematics can be distinctly traced to the attempt to

express mathematically the observed relations among physical magnitudes. By way
of illustration of this statement, it may suffice to refer to the well-known cases of

the theory of fluxions, to Fourier's theorem and the doctrine of harmonic analysis,

to spherical harmonics, and to the theory of potential, out of which, in the hands of

Riemann, there grew a general and most remarkable theory of mathematical

functions.

   The way in which physics reacts, so as to promote the advancement of a
knowledge of mathematics, finds in many respects a close parallel in the influence

exerted by the practical industrial arts on the progress of physics. This influence

shows itself very distinctly, first, in the new conceptions and new points of view

which practical pursuits supply to scientific physics, and, secondly, in the new sub-

jects and new opportunities which they offer for physical investigation.

  A very remarkable and important example of the former kind of influence is
--6 REPORT 1877.

afforded by the idea of Work and the correlative one of Energy. These ideas, which

have been found to have a most far-reaching significance and to have exerted a trans-

forming effect upon every branch of physics, owe their recognition, not to the

spontaneous growth of the science, but to their having been forced on the atten-

tion of physicists by the cultivators of practical mechanics*. Very much the

same thing may also be said of the modern conceptions of the nature of heat

and of the relation between thermal phenomena and those of other branches of

physics. The notion of heat as a measurable magnitude, of which definite

quantities could be given to or taken away from bodies, was fully established by

the researches of Black and Wilke on Latent and Specific Heat. This was at

the time when the idea of chemical composition was just taking its modern shape

through the recognition of aeriform bodies as possible constituents of solids and

liquids, and it was consequently natural that the new knowledge of the laws of

heat should be embodied in the conception of a Matter of Heat or Caloric capable

of entering into and being separated from combination like fixed air or dephlogisti-

cated air. And in fact this conception not only took the place of philosophical

speculations upon the nature of heat, such as those of Bacon and Locke, but it

withstood the experimental onslaughts of Ivumford and Davy, as well as the

penetrating scientific criticism of Thomas Young. It is to the steam-engine, and

to the attempt to find out the nature of the connexion obviously existing

between the amount of heat supplied and the work done by the engine, that we

must trace the downfall of the idea of the materiality of heat and the origin of

our modern views t.

Probably it would be impossible to find a more remarkable instance of what I

referred to j ust now, as the second way in which practice may react upon science

so as to promote its advancement, than is presented to us in the case of electric

telegraphy. This is an example of an industrial undertaking which is the direct

offspring of scientific research, and could not have coexisted in its actual state of

development with a less  advanced  condition of  electrical  science                               but if it  were
                                                                                                ;

possible to establish any common measure for such things, it may he doubted

whether it would not be found that telegraphy has repaid to science benefits equal

to those it has received. For instance, the discovery of earth-currents was a direct

result of the large scale of the instrumental arrangements which are needed for tele-

graphic purposes, and is one which would probably have long remained unmade in

the absence of some inducement to make experiments on a scale greater than that

indicated by the visible wants of scientific inquiry. The same may be said of the

discovery of the influence of electrostatic induction upon the transmission of elec-

tric currents through metallic conductors, and of the consequent additions to our

knowledge of the specific inductive capacity of insulators and of the whole subject

of electrostatic capacity. But by far the most important of the benefits conferred

by electric telegraphy upon electrical science have resulted from the necessity under

which the practical electrician found himself, of not only being able to produce

certain results, but of producing them under definitely ascertained conditions as to

the expenditure of time and material. When it was perceived that slight variations

in the electrical conductivity, insulating power, or specific inductive capacity of

certain materials might affect the pecuniary return upon investments reckoned in

millions of pounds sterling, measuring instruments were devised which far sur-

passed in delicacy and accuracy those that had been previously made for purely

scientific purposes, or the cost of which exceeded the means usually at the disposal

of scientific investigators. The multiplication and wide diffusion of such instru-

ments have led to the rapid accumulation of numerical data of great scientific im-

portance, and have largely contributed to the spread of accurate conceptions as to

the quantitative laws of electrical phenomena. But the further necessity experi-

enced by practical electricians, that, besides being able to make accurate "measure-

ments, they should be able mutually to communicate and to understand each other's

results, has probably done more than any thing else to hasten the introduction, for

 scientific purposes, of so-called " absolute " measurements, instead of mere com-
parisons of each quantity to be estimated with a standard magnitude of its own kind.
 The use of absolute measures constitutes one of the most clmracteristic differ-

 ences between the Physics of to-day and that of the time when the British Asso-
ciation was instituted, and it may even be said to lie at the base of the doctrine of
 the Conservation of Energy, which implies the principle that every kind of Energy
 can be reduced to the same denomination.

    Perhaps, after speaking as I have done of the necessity for the cooperation of
mathematics in the advancement of physics, it is not inappropriate that I should,

in conclusion, refer to the possibility that, by a too implicit reliance upon mathe-

matical guidance, the physicist may be led away from the discovery of fresh truth

or even into actual error. Mathematics is seen to be so indispensable and usually

so powerful an aid in physical investigation, that there is a danger of forgetting

that there are, after all, limits to its power. Partly from want of sufficient know-
ledge of the physical data on which mathematical discussion must be based, and
partly from the imperfection of mathematical methods themselves, it happens that

 it is not possible to give a thoroughly complete mathematical account of even the

simplest physical phenomenon. In all real cases, although some one effect may

 often predominate so greatly as alone to attract attention on a cursory view, the

 actual complexity is so great that it is only by deliberately leaving out of consi-

deration what we believe to be the accidental accompaniments of a phenomenon,
and confining our attention to what seems to be its essential and characteristic
part, that it is possible to make it the subject of mathematical calculation. The

 consequence is that the problems treated of in mathematical physics are not the pro-

blems presented by nature, but are problems suggested by these and derived from
 them by a process of ideal simplification. There is therefore always a possibility
 that, in the simplifying process, some apparently trivial, but really important,
feature of the actual phenomenon, to which the ideal one is meant to correspond,

may have been overlooked. When this is the case, the fact will reveal itself sooner

 or later by the occurrence of discrepancies between the results of mathematical

 theory and those of experimental investigation. Such discrepancies are the finger-

 posts pointing to new discoveries ; but the experimenter wrho forgets the inevitable

 limitation to the authority of theoretical conclusions, arising from the conditions
 I have alluded to, is apt to disregard them, and perhaps conscious of laziness and
 want of care in his method of experimenting, or sometimes from a want of proper

self-confidence, he attributes all anomalous results to "the unavoidable errors of

 observation."

   Two classes of experimenters are safe from falling into this danger. There are,

 first, those who, the first time they observe any thing that is not provided for in

their text-books, conclude that the Law of Gravitation ought to be reconsidered

 secondly, there are those who, with scrupulous care, take account of all the

 conditions which are known to be able to affect the phenomenon they are investi-
gating, and are thus able to say, with well-founded confidence, when they meet
with some unforeseen result, that it must indicate the operation of some unrecognized

cause.

   A brilliant example of this latter mode of working and of the discoveries to which

it may lead has recently been afforded to us by the researches of Mr. Crookes, some
 of whose results, as embodied in the now well-known instrument which he has
called the " Radiometer," have attracted much attention. It has appeared to me,

 however, that the surprising nature of these results has to some extent called off
 attention from the remarkable character of the scientific investigation which led to

them ; and it was at one time my intention to take advantage of the present oppor-

 tunity for the purpose of trying, on the one hand, to render to Mr. Crookes the
credit which I think his researches deserve, and, on the other hand, to give a con-
nected account of the further investigations, both experimental and theoretical, to
which these researches have given rise. There seemed to be the more reason for

endeavouring to carry out the former part of my intention, inasmuch as an eminent
and accomplished scientific man had published, within the last few months, an

account of the discovery of the Radiometer, the unmistakable tendency of which
was, either intentionally or unintentionally, to depreciate Mr. Crooke's merits, and

to make it appear that he had put a wrong interpretation upon his own results.

I found, however, that the time at my disposal would not enable me to make

myself sufficiently master of the whole subject to treat it in the way that I wished,

and I have therefore been obliged to content myself with merely making this
allusion to it, as an illustration of the more general considerations to which I have
ventured to ask your attention.

BOn the Calculation of Bernoulli's Numbers up to r ,t by means of Staudt's

                Theorem. By Professor J. C. Adams, M.A., F.11.S.

Thirty-one of the numbers of Bernoulli are at present known to Mathematicians,

Ohmand are to be found in a communication by     in Crelle's Journal, vol. xx. p. 11.

Of these numbers the first fifteen are given in Eider's ' Institutiones Calculi Differ-

Ohmentialis,' part 2, chap. 5, and  states that the sixteen following numbers were

calculated and communicated to him by Professor Rothe of Erlangen. I find, how-

ever, that the first two of these had been already given by Eider in a memoir con-

tained in the 'Acta Petropolitana ' for 1781.

  A remarkable theorem, due to Staudt, gives at once the fractional part of any

one of Bernoulli's numbers, and thus greatly facilitates the finding of these numbers

by reducing all the requisite calculations to operations with integers only.

The theorem may be thus stated :

If 1,2, a, a' ... . 2m be all the divisors of 2m, and if unity be added to each of

these divisors so as to form the series 2, 3, rt-f-1, «'-f-i .... 2w-|-l, and if from this

series only the prime numbers 2, 3, p, p' .... be selected, then the fractional part
of the «tli number of Bernoulli will be

<-»-G+H +>-)-

   Having found, several years ago, a simple and elementary proof of this theorem,
I was induced to apply the theorem to the calculation of several additional numbers
of Bernoulli, and I ultimately obtained the values of the thirty-one numbers which

are given in the present paper.

   The method which has been employed affords numerous tests, throughout the
course of the work, of the correctness with which the requisite operations have been

peiformed, so that I feel entire confidence in the accuracy of the results.

   I propose to publish some of the principal steps of these calculations in an Ap-
pendix to the twenty-second volume of the ' Cambridge Observations,' which is now

in the press. In making them I have received very efficient aid from my Assis-

tants, Mr. Graham and Mr. Todd.
   The following is an outline of the method employed :

  B BBernoidli's numbers u a, &c. are defined by the equation

--XT -,=l-<5.t'+r^- ~i 9 3 4? +«c.-r-(-I)                            -KVc.

If we multiply by --e* 1, and equate to zero the coefficient of ar"+I on the right-

hand side of the resulting equation, we shall find

                                   +C 1 /1 +C 2 /2 +&c.+Cm /a

  Now by Staudt's Theorem the fraction £ occurs in each of the fractions/^; hence

must be divisible by 2n+lj and this supplies a test of the correctness of the work.

   I have proved that if n be a prime number, other than 2 or 3, then the numerator
of the wth number of Bernoulli will be divisible by n.

   This forms another excellent test of the correctness of the work.
   I have also observed that if q be a prime factor of n, which is not likewise a factor

Bof the denominator of B, then the numerator of B,, will be divisible by q. I have

not succeeded, however, in obtaining a general proof of this proposition, though I
have no doubt of its truth.

        It may be sometimes useful to have the values of Bernoulli's numbers expressed

     in integers and repeating decimals.
        It readily follows from Staudt's theorem that if the fractional part of the wth

     number of Bernoulli be converted into a repeating decimal, then the number of
     figures in the repeating part will be either 2n or a divisor of 2», and the first figure
     of the repeating part will occupy the second place of decimals.

On the Calculation of the Sum of the Reciprocals of the First Thousand In-

   tegers, and on the Value of Eulers Constant to 260 Places of Decimals.
   Bxj Professor J. C. Adams, M.A., F.B.S.

   If S denote the sum of the harmonic series
                     tt

Rn being an integer, and if n denote the value, defined in the usual way, of the

semi-convergent series

where     B,,  B        B^,  &c.  are  the  numbers  of  Bernoulli,  then  the  value  of Euler's  con-
                    2,

stant E is given approximately by

                                       E=S>  -logoec     n-i-+R,,.

                                                                 in
                                   TUANSACTIONS Or THE SECTIONS.                                                 15

   Having computed the values of 31 of Bernoulli's numbers in addition to those

previously known, I have been able to find a much more approximate value of E

than has been before obtained.

  In fact, by putting n = 1000 in the above formula, the value of E is correctly found

to more than 260 places of decimals.

   In order to diminish as much as possible the number of decimal fractions which

mii3t be added together to form S 1000 , 1 first resolved the reciprocal of every integer
up to 1000 into ordinary fractions whose denominators were primes or powers of
primes, and then combined the fractions corresponding to each of these primes into
one sum, so that finally the number of decimal fractions to be added together was

reduced to the number of prime numbers below 1000.
   Also the value of log 1000 or 3 log 10 was derived from the Napierian loga-

                10   25                   81
rithms of
                                ,  and 575, which may be found by extremely simple operations
                  9

when the reciprocals of the successive integers are supposed to have been pre-

viously expressed in repeating decimals.

   The following Table gives the results which I have thus obtained :

mean motion, and /x the absolute force.
   Also let r, r' denote the radii vectores, and u, u' the excentric anomalies at the

extremities of any arc, k the chord, and t the time of describing the arc.

Then                               = =r «(1 -e cos m), r' -a(l e cos *«'),

Suggestion of a Mechanical Integrator for tlic calculation of \(Xdx+Ydy)
                along an arbitrary Path. By Professor Caylet.

YI consider an integral \(Xdx-\-Ydy), where X, are each of them a given func-

tion of the variables (x, y). Xdx-\-Ydy is thus not in general an exact differential

but assuming a relation between (x, y), that is, a path of the integral, there is in

effect one variable only, and the integral becomes calculable. I wish to show how

for any given values of the functions X, Y, but for an arbitrary path, it is possible

to construct a mechanism for the calculation of the integral, viz. a mechanism such

Dthat a point thereof being moved in a plane along a path chosen at pleasure, the

corresponding value of the integral shall be exhibited on a dial.

The mechanism (for convenience I speak of it as actually existing) consists of

a square block, or inverted box, the upper horizontal face whereof is taken as the

plane of xy, the equations of its edges being y=0, y= 1, x=0, x=l respectively. In

the wall-faces represented by these equations we have the endless bands A, A',B,B'

respectively, and in the plane of xy a driving point D, the coordinates of which

are (x, y), and a regulating point R, mechanically connected with 1) in suchwise

R Ythat the coordinates of are always the given functions X, of the coordinates of

D* ; the nature of the mechanical connexion will, of course, depend upon the par-

ticular functions X, Y.

  ADThis being so, drives the bands and B in such manner that to the given

Dmotions dx, dy of corresponds a motion dx of the band A, and a motion dy of the

B Aband ; drives A' with a velocity-ratio depending on the position of the regu-
R Rlator in suchwise that the coordinates of being X, Y, then to the motion dxot
A Bcorresponds a motion Xdx of A' ; and similarly drives B' with a velocity-ratio
Bdepending on the position of R, in suchwise that to the motion dy of corresponds
Da motion Ydy of B'. Hence to the motions dx, dy of the driver there correspond

the motions Xdx and Ydy of the bands A' and B' respectively. The band A' drives

a hand or index, and the band B' drives, in the contrary sense, a graduated dial,

the hand and dial rotating independently of        each  other  about  a  common  centre
                                                                                                             ;

Ynate functions of X, respective!}'.

=the increased reading of the hand on the dial is thus Xdx-\-Ydi/ and supposing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

Dthe original reading to be zero, and the driver to he moved from its original post"

tion along an arbitrary path to any other position whatever, the reading on the

+dial will be the corresponding value of the integral [(Xd.i Ydy).

It is obvious that we might by means of a combination of two such mechanisms

calculate the value of an integral J/(«) du along an arbitrary path of the complex

=variable u,=x+iy; in fact, writing /(*+(v) r+e'Q., the differential is now
(P+iQ)(dx + id!/), = rdx -- Qd!/+i(Qdx'+Vdi/); and we thus require the calculation

of the two iutegrals |"(P<fa-- Qdy) and UQdx+Tdy), each of which is an integral

of the above form. Taking for the path a closed curve, it would be very curious to
see the machne giving a value zero, or a value different from zero, according as the

path included or did not include within it a critical point ; it seems to me that this

discontinuity would really exhibit itself without the necessity of any chaDge in the

setting of the machine.

   The ordinary modes of establishing a continuously variable velocity-ratio between
two parts of a machine depend upon friction ; and in particular this is the case in
Prof. James Thomson's mechanical integrator : there is thus, of course, a limitation

of the driving-power. It seems to me that a variable velocity-ratio, the variation

of which is practically, although not strictly, continuous, might be established, by
means of toothed wheels (and so with unlimited driving-power), in the following
manner :

  Consider a revolving wheel A, which, by means of a link BC pivoted to a point B

Aof the wheel and a point C of a toothed wheel or arc D, communicates a recipro-

cating motion to D, the extent of this reciprocating motion depending on the dis-

Btance of from the centre of A, which distance, or say the half-throw, is assumed

to be variable. Here, during a half-revolution of A, l) moves in one direction, say

Dupwards ; and during the other half-revolution of A, moves in the other direction

say downwards, the extent of these equal and opposite motions varying with the

Dthrow. Suppose, then, that works a pinion E, the centre of which is not abso-
A Alutely fixed, but is so connected with that during the first half-revolution of
D E(or while is moving upwards) is in gear with I), and during the second half-
A E DDrevolution of (or while is moving downwards) is out of gear with · the
Acontinuous rotation of will communicate an intermittent rotation to E, in such

manner, nevertheless, that to each entire revolution of A, or rotation throuo-li the

Eangle 2tt, there will (the throw remaining constant) correspond a rotation of

through the angle n . 2ir, where the coefficient n depends upon the throw. And evi-

Adently if be driven by a wheel A', the angular velocity of which is r- times that
                                                                    A
--of A, then to a rotation of A' through each angle
                                                     there will correspond an entire

Erevolution of A, and therefore, as before, a rotation of through the determinate

angle n.2w; hence, X being sufficiently large, to each increment of rotation of A'

Ethere corresponds in an increment of rotation which is tiX times the first-men-
Etioned increment, viz. moves (intermittently, or in beats as explained, and possi-
Ebly also with some " loss of time " on coming successively in gear and out of

gear with D) with an angular velocity which is =MA times the angular velocity of

A-'                and thus the throw, and therefore n, being variable, the velocity-ratio nX is also
                :

variable.

  AAVe may imagine the wheel Las carrying upon it a piece sliding between guides,

which piece L carries the pivot B, of the link BC, and works by a rack on a toothed

wheel a, concentric with A, but capable of rotating independently thereof. Then

if a. rotates along witli A, as if forming one piece therewith, it Avill act as a clamp

B Aupon L, keeping the distance of from the centre of (that is, the half-throw) con-

       On the Enumeration of the Primes in BurcJchardt and Base's Tables.

                        By J. *W. L. Glaisher, M.A., F.B.S.

    Burckhardt's 'Tables des diviseurs ' (1814-1817) give the least divisor of every
number up to 3,036,000, and Base's ' Factoren Tafeln ' (1862-65) give the least di-
visor of every number from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000 ; there is thus left a gap of three
millions for -which there are no printed tables.

   In 1871 I commenced the enumeration of the primes in the six millions over
which the published tables extend. The work was performed in duplicate by two
computers independently ; the two enumerations were then read with one another
and the discrepancies marked. All the doubtM numbers were then examined and
brought into agreement ; subsequently one of them was examined tie novo with the

original tables.

  A short account of the enumeration, as far as it had then proceeded, together with

an abstract of the results for two of the millions, was published in the British Associa-

tion Report for 1872 (" On the Law of Distribution of Prime Numbers," Transac-

tions of the Sections, pp. 19-21). I have there given tables showing the agreement
of the number of primes counted with the theoretical numbers derived from the
logarithm-integral formula of Tchebycheff and Hargreave for the second and ninth
millions, arranged in groups of 50,000. Soon afterwards I became acquainted with
the enumerations printed amongst the posthumous works of Gauss (' Werke,' t. ii.

pp. 436-447, 1863j, and I found many discrepancies between these results and my

own. This, taken in conjunction with the great difficulty of attaining the certainty

of accuracy in so troublesome an enumeration, led me to lay aside the work. In

1876, however, I recommenced the whole again, the work being carefully performed

by a fresh computer, who had had no connexion with the previous enumerations.
The primes in the first three millions and in the seventh million were enumerated
de novo ; but the results for the eighth and ninth millions were only examined. No

errors were found in the values for the ninth million given in the 1872 paper, but
several were found in the second million ; they are as follows :

Whenever there is no prime in a century, there must be a succession of at least

100 consecutive composite numbers ; and whenever there is only one prime, there

must be a succession of at least 50 ; but, of course, a 2-prime century or a 3-prime

century need not indicate a long sequence. In order to find long successions of

composite numbers I had all the instances in which there were 0, 1, 2, or 3 primes

in a century looked out in the tables, and the cases noted down in which the

sequence was fifty or upwards. These lists, for the six millions, were exhibited to

the Meeting at Plymouth. I only here give, in the next Table, some of the longest

sequences found in this manner, viz. those which exceed 110 in the first three

millions, and those which exceed 120 in the other three millions.

to the lower limit and the upper limit are all composite. It is to be noted that the
above list is not complete, as the method pursued does not, of course, give all the

sequences. The two long sequences in the first million seem to me very remarkable.

   Lists of sequences of 79 and upwards in the first million, and of 99 and upwards
for the other five millions, are given in the ' Messenger of Mathematics/ vol. vii.
pp. 102-106 and 171-176 (November 1877 and March 1878), where also are to be
found several other tables of a similar kind, including a complete list of sequences
exceeding 50 between 1 and 100,000.

   Tho following sequences that occur very early in the series of natural numbers

deserve to be specially noted, viz.

                                   By Henry M. Jeffery, M.A.

           1. There are four cases for consideration, according as the number of foci at

        infinity is three, two, one, or none.
           If three foci are real and at an infinite distance, the line at infinity (£=i;=0) is

        an acubitangent,

    Let the equation be written with polar tangential coordinates

                                j>=aco8 (0+a) cos (0+/3) cos (6+y).

 --The position of the cusps is thus determined : Since -^=0,

    +f=tan (0+/3) tan (6+y) tan (6+y) tan (6+a)+ tan (6+a) tan (6+P).

   If the cusps form an equilateral triangle, the lines joining them with the satel-
lite-point pass through the foci.

   2. If two foci are at infinity, the line at infinity is a bitangent.

   The cubica of this division may be thus expressed by oblique Boothian co-

ordinates,

                        ^+0£+</7-l)(£2 +'?2 -2£? cos »)=0.

If X.ry+a;2 -r-2/2 +2a^cos<i))=0,

the cubic is resolved into a point and a parabola,

                                     \x y                               )

= --4If X 4 sin2 ^-, or      cos2 ", the cubic is inflexional, and acubitangential or veri-

bitangential, according as X lies within or beyond these limits.
   The exhibited figures were constructed for rectangular coordinates.
   3. Let three single foci be collinear, and one of them at infinity.
   Let the Boothian equation denote the group

                           x$a-w+(*i+w-i)(£2 4y)=o,

so that the origin bisects the distance between the foci.

   It denotes a unipartite curve whose asymptotes intersect at an angle 60°. For
such a position of the satellite on this locus there are three critical values of the
parameter, which yield inflexional, acubitangential, and veribitangential cubics.
If the satellite lies within the bounding curve, there are four critical values ; if be-
yond, two are real, and two imaginary.

   4. Let one focus be at infinity, and the quadrantal pole of the line joining the

other two.

   The discriminant of this quintic determines the locus of the satellite, when the

cubic is inflexional.

The curve is trinodal at the foci, and unipartite, with a pair of asymptotes

through the origin, and the (y) axis for a third asymptote. If the satellite lie on

either of the exterior loops of the bounding curve, there are four critic values, one

of them inflexional ; if the satellite fall within, five ; if without, three critic values
if it lie on an interior loop, two critic values, one of them inflexional ; if within, only

one critic value, viz. the veribitangential.

For positions of the satellite along the (a?) axis, the preceding quintic becomes

                                  (J2£-.r)(&2£2 -2*!+l) 2 =0.

   The first value resolves the cubic into a point and a parabola ; the other pair of

--coincident values yields two bitangential and not inflexional cubics four, if the

satellite lie beyond the foci.
   5. The case in which the focus at infinity has neither of the preceding positions,

and all the cases where the foci are finite, remain for consideration.

A1. non-singular cubic consists of an infinite number of such tetrads ; and if

any one be drawn, the remaining tetrads may be obtained by transversals drawn

ABCDfrom the several points of the cubic. Each tetrad                                                                                    yields three pairs of

dyads,      AB,     CD                  AC, BD ;     AD, BC                                and each pair                of  dyad iines touches a sepa-

rate Cayleyan class-cubic.

Let transversals through P on the cubic pass through A, B, C, D, and intersect

it again in A', B', C', D' ; then, as has been stated, these points constitute a new

tetrad; and if A', B', C, D' be joined in pairs with A, B, C, D, their points of

intersection are three, and with P constitute a new tetrad.

These characteristic theorems, which are not new, maybe simply obtained by the

following proofs. It will also appear that the locus of the intersections of pairs of

tangents drawn at the points where transversals through a fixed point on the

cubic intersect it is a trinodal quartic, which passes through the first tetrad of

corresponding points, the three other corresponding points of the second tetrad of

which the fixed point is one, and through the coresidual or its own tangential point.

The loci of the several points in which these concurrent transversals are divided

to those of the primitive cubic, and at whose node the rectangular tangents are

parallel to the asymptotes of                              its  pole conic                                    (2)  a central          cubic, with asymptotes

pole conic, as is well known, a rectangular hyperbola.

   It will be simpler, and not less general, to take the centre of the inscribed circle
(1, 1, 1) as the origin of transversals ; the cubic then becomes

                                 ^O-y)+L,     (y_        o)  +  f!(a-/3)=0.

corresponding points, of which the centre (1, 1, 1) is their common tangential

Apoint.            second tetrad of corresponding points is formed by the diagonal points of

the quadrilateral A, B, 0, and D, the centre (1, 1, 1); their common tangential

point  (a;2        y",  s2)  is  the conjugate       pole of    the           first     tangential                  (1,  1,  1)  with respect

By the first property, the two points are conjugate poles with respect to the

system of conies through the basis-points (+x, +y, +s).

second tetrad, A, B, C, D; the coordinates of the third points of intersections

On a Meteor which passed over Bhawnpore, in India, in October 1873.

                           By Major G. N. Monet.

While staying at the capital of the independent state of Bhawnpore, on the

Sutlej, the author was aroused from sleep early one inorning by a tremendous

sound resembling the passage of several express trains, while the room was brightly

illuminated, and this sound was followed by violent explosions which shook the

building. He at first supposed an earthquake had occurred. After breakfast he

heard that a shower of stones had fallen eighteen miles ofl" to the north-east, and

later in the day some pieces were brought in. The largest was an irregular mas?,

ii ft. long by 1 ft. thick, still hot, blackened outside as by the action of fire, of a

dark grey colour inside, and very heavy. The natives said there were many more

Aone as large as a bullock-cart.  second shower fell about thirty miles beyond the

first. There could be no deception, as there were no other stones within a hundred

miles of Bhawnpore, the soil being purely alluvial or sandy. The meteor, it ap-

Jteared, was seen by a European who was superintending the erection of a palace
 or the Nawab. He described it as a huge ball of fire, as big as twenty moons,

which passed with a roaring sound directly over his head in a north-easterly di-

rection. It lit up the whole sky, the light being perfectly dazzling, and left behind

it a flaming track of red, green, and yellow. Before passing out of sight two ex-

plosions in quick succession took place, at each of which a shower of sparks seemed

to fall, but no alteration was apparent in the size or shape of the meteor itself.

No attempt was made by the Government to collect information about this re-

markable meteor. To give some idea of its magnitude it was stated that it was

seen and heard at points quite 400 miles from Bhawnpore.

Some neiv Optical Illusions. By Shvantjs P. Thompson, B.Sc, B.A.

The relative motions of an object and a spectator may give rise to illusions in

which motions differing- in direction or character may he apparently produced.

Some illusions of this class were brought forward by the late Sir D. Brewster in

the 'Transactions ' of the Brit. Assoc, for 1845, 1848, and 1861. The author has

observed several other cases of illusory motion apparently due to a retinal compen-

sation of the disturbance produced by the motion of images across the retina.

Several of the illusions cited were observed in railway travelling. Thus, if from

a rapid railway train objects from which the train is receding be watched, they

seem to shrink as they are left behind, their images contracting and moving from

the edges of the retina towards its centre. If after watching this motion for some

time the gaze be transferred to an object at a constant distance from the eye, it

seems to be actually expanding and approaching.
--AThe author also drew attention to the following illusion:
                                                                                                          series of concentric

circles of black and white are drawn upon a card. This is held firmly between the

the thumb and finger, while a circular shaking motion is imparted to' it by a move-

ment of wrist and elbow, the circles appearing to rotate upon the card. It was held

that the various effects of "compensation" to the movement of retinal images

could be explained by supposing them to set up a secondary wave of nervous dis-

turbance propagated in an opposite direction to that of the primary movement of

the images.

On the Relative Apparent Brightness of Objects in Binocular and Monocular

                Vision. By Silvanus P. Thompson, B.Sc, B.A.

It is a common idea that objects appear brighter when seen with the two eyes

than with one. There appear, however, to be exceptions to this statement. The

following is a method of submitting the question to photometric measurement. The

comparison-photometer employed consists of a cardboard screen having an aperture

divided into two equal portions. One half is covered with tissue-paper, and illu ·

ruinated directly from behind. Behind the other half is set, at the polarizing angle,

a mirror of black glass. Light from a second lamp falls upon a screen of tissue-

paper, whose light is then reflected in the mirror. Thus the two halves of the aper-

ture may be illuminated equally, but with light in one case wholly unpolarized, in

the other wholly polarized. Let two Nicol prisms be now taken, having their prin-

cipal sections placed parallel and perpendicular respectively to the plane of polari-

zation of the mirror, and let one Nicol be placed in front of each eye. One eye only

will receive the whole of the polarized light, while the unpolarized light will be

equally distributed, half to each eye. The total amount of light received upon the

retinal surface will be the same from each half of the aperture ; but their apparent

illuminations will be unequal, that of the polarized light appearing the greater. By

comparing the distances at which the lamps must be placed it appears that light is
more powerful in producing an effect when concentrated upon one eye than when

equally distributed to the two, though according to what law experiments are not

yet sufficiently numerous or exact  to determine                                                    but,  on the other hand, the  light
                                                                                                 ;

so concentrated on one eye does not produce the sensation of twice as much illumi-

nation as the half of the light viewed by both eyes at once.

On Magnetic Induction as affecting Observations of the Intensity of the

   Chambebs, F.B.S., Superintendent of the Colaba Observatory, Bombay.

   All our experiments for the measurement of the earth's magnetic force are neces-
sarily made in the field of that force, consequently the magnets used in observations
of deflection and vibration are subject to the inducing action of that force and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

it is the universal practice of magnetic observatories, sanctioned by the most
eminent writers on terrestrial magnetism, to apply corrections on accoimt of induc-

tion both to the deflection and vibration observations. The object of this com-

--munication is to advance theoretical reasons supported by experimental evidence

against the propriety of the particular correction applied to the vibration observa-

tion. This correction is based on the assumption that the vibration-magnet is
susceptible of induction longitudinally but not transversely, or not so sensibly and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the assumption probably rests on what the writer regards as a false analogy between

a permanent magnet and an induced magnet. The former, when removed from

the influence of a strong magnetizing action, remains a magnet by virtue of its own

internal forces, whilst the latter is a magnet by virtue of external forces alone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

--it does not therefore follow that because the power of a permanent magnet mea-
--sured by its magnetic moment cannot be made by the same means nearly as great

transversely as longitudinally, therefore the same may be said of an induced magnet.

Indeed, in his treatment of the subject of the deviations of the compass, Sir
George Airy gives to each elemental portion of a ship's iron as great a suscepti-

bility to induction in one direction as in another ; and in the more elaborate treat-
ment of the same subject, in which Poisson's equations are taken as expressing the

fundamental conception of the theory, terms representing transverse induction are

still retained, as of comparable magnitude, in presence of others representing longi-

tudinal induction.

Applying the Astronomer Eoyal's theory to the particular case of the vibration

magnet, its induced magnetism becomes an assemblage of elementary magnets

whose magnetic axes are all parallel to the magnetic meridian, and which, since

they sensibly retain their parallelism to the meridian during the oscillation of the

magnet, give rise   to no moment of                                                                                                                                     restitution                                                    hence, according  to this view, no
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

correction would be required. According to Poisson's theory the amount of the

correction is matter for experimental inquiry, and cannot be safely determined on

a priori ground. It may be objected, however, that the swinging of a ship being

a slow motion compared with the oscillation of a magnet, the theory of the devia-

tions of the compass must be modified in its application to the case in question
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;
and this is no doubt a correct view
                                                                                                                                                                     ;  for the theory regards the inductive action as

being, at every moment considered, sensibly carried to its limit of effectiveness

whilst it is not only conceivable, but doubtless the fact, that where, as with the

oscillating magnet, the motion is reversed every few seconds, the transverse induc-

tive action only partially approaches its limit. On this account we should be pre-

pared to expect, then, that even if the transverse induction were as great as the

longitudinal, when time for full development of the induction was allowed, it

would be in some degree in defect in the case of the vibrating magnet.

   In the years 1873 and 1874, long before these views on the subject of induction

first occurred to the writer, he had had made in Bombay a useful comparison of

two Kew umfilar magnetometers, by means of practically contemporaneous obser-

vations. The result was to show a persistent difference in the values of the hori-

zontal force yielded by the two instruments, far exceeding any probable errors of

observation, and, after a careful examination of each single observational quantity,
and of each constant entering into the computations, the writer came to the con-
clusion that no error of the magnitude of that in question could have its source

anywhere but in connexion with the induction corrections. The values obtained
for the horizontal force were (in British units of force) :

No. 23 showing an excess over No. 17 of -0154 British units of force, or of -0019 of

the whole horizontal force.

  We observe that the greatest value given by No. 17 is less than the least value

given by No. 23, and infer that the difference between the two means cannot be

attributed to probable error of observation, the value of which for a single deter-

mination (about -001 of the whole force) is, moreover, much smaller.

If we now remove the corrections applied for induction to the vibration observa-

tions, the mean value yielded by No. 17 becomes -0004 of the whole force, greater

than the mean yielded by No. 23. It thus appears that a small correction, such as
we have already seen reason to expect, is required for the vibration observation,

but (on an average for the two instruments employed) only of about one sixth of

the  value of that which  it is  the custom of magneticians to                                     apply                               and as this

small quantity scarcely exceeds the probable error of the mean determination of the

horizontal force, it is yet premature to attribute it to any definite cause. Whilst,

however, the experiments afford no sufficient reason for applying this small cor-

rection, they speak very distinctly in favour of no induction correction at all for

the vibration observation as against the common practice.

To show that the error that we have been discussing is not of that minute order

that is usually disregarded, we may mention that it would amount, in the case of

the unifilar magnetometer used at the Kew Observatory, to about eight times the

probable error of an observation.

          On the Telephone. By W. H. Pbeece, Memb. Inst. C.E., fyc.

   In the following paper, instruments employed in the transmission of musical
sounds are called tone telephones, and those employed in the transmission of the

human voice, articulating telephones.
   In the year 1837, Page, an American physicist, discovered that the rapid magne-

tization and demagnetization of iron bars produced what he called "galvanic
music." Musical notes depend upon the number of vibrations imparted to the air

per second. If these exceed sixteen we obtain distinct notes. Hence, if the
currents passing through an electromagnet be made and broken more than sixteen

limes per second, we obtain "galvanic music" by the vibrations which the iron bat
imparts to the air. The iron bar itself imparts these vibrations by its change of

form each time it is magnetized or demagnetized.

   De la Rive, of Geneva, in 1843, increased these musical effects by operating on

long stretched wires which passed through open bobbins of insulated wire.

    Philip Reiss, of Friedrichsdorf, in 1801, produced the first telephone which re-
produced musical sounds at a distance. lie utilized the discovery of Page by
causing a vibrating diaphragm to rapidly make and break a galvanic circuit. The
principal of his apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 annexed, in which the diagram (b) is
a hollow wooden box into which the operator sings through the mouthpiece (a).

                                       Xine

The sound of his voice throws the diaphragm (e) into rapid vibration, so as to make

and break contact at the platinum points (d) at each vibration. This interrupts the

current flowing from the battery (c) as often as the diaphragm vibrates, and

therefore magnetizes and demagnetizes the electromagnet as often. Hence what-

ever note be sounded into the box (a) the diaphragm (e) will vibrate to the note,

and the electromagnet/ will similarly respond, and therefore repeat that note.

Musical sounds vary in tone, in intensity, and in quality. The tone depends on

the number of vibrations per second only                                                                                                                                                                                            the intensity on the amplitude or extent
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

of those vibrations ; the quality on the form of the waves made by the vibrating

particles of air.

It is evident that in Reiss's telephone everything at the receiving end remains the

same, excepting the number of vibrations, and therefore the sounds emitted by it

varied only in tone, and were therefore notes and nothing more. The instrument

remained a pretty philosophical toy, and was of no practical value.

   Cromwell Varley, in 1870, showed how sounds could be produced by rapidly

charging and discharging a condenser.

   Elisha Gray, of Chicago, in 1873 succeeded in producing tones from the finger
when rubbing a dry sonorous body, such as an ordinary tin can, while the inter-

mittent currents sent by a vibrating tuning-fork were passing through it ; and by
attaching an electromagnet to a hollow sounding-box, open at one end and closed

at the other, he was able to reproduce the tones of the musical notes transmitted.

His electromagnet had its armature rigidly fixed to one pole, and separated from

the other by a space of fjth of an inch. He called it a resonator. The vibrations

of this armature are imparted to the sounding-box, and become, therefore, magnified.

He constructed a keyboard, of two octaves compass, with steel reeds, each of which

was tuned to its proper note and maintained in vibration by electromagnets.

When the key corresponding to any note was depressed, its corresponding reed was

connected to line and the proper number of currents transmitted to the distant

station, where they operated the resonator and thus reproduced the note. In this

way tunes were played, and the instrument became an electric organ. By attaching

organ-pipes to his resonator he magnified the sounds, and was able to fill a large
hall with music played at places from 00 to 208 miles away. More than that, he

proved the practicability of transmitting chords and composite sounds to distant
places. Gray also invented a method by which the intensity of the notes as well

as their tones could be transmitted. Mr. Leonard Wray also introduced a capital
--36 REPORT 1877.

receiver which emits the sounds received from a distance by means of Keiss's
diaphragm.

   It remained for Professor Graham Bell, of Boston, who has been worMng at this
question with the true spirit of a philosopher since 1872, to make the discovery by
which tone, intensity, and quality of sounds can all be sent. He has rendered it
possible to reproduce the human voice with all its modulations at distant points. I

have spoken with a person at various distances up to 32 mile3 ; and through about
a quarter of a mile I have heard Professor Bell breathe, laugh, sneeze, cough, and,

in fact, make any sound the human voice can produce. Without explaining the

various stages through which his apparatus has passed, it will be sufficient to explain
it in its present form. Like Reiss he throws a diaphragm into vibration, but
Professor Bell's diaphragm is a disk of thin iron (a), which vibrates in front of a

Nsoft iron core (b), attached to the pole of a permanent bar-magnet S (see Fig. 2).

                                                                                 T.inc:

                                  K

NThis core becomes magnetized by the influence of the bar-magnet S, inducing all

around it a magnetic field and attracting the iron diaphragm towards it. Around
this core is wound a small coil (c) of No. 38 silk-covered copper wire. One end of
this wire is attached to the line wire, the other is connected to the earth. The
apparatus at each end is identically similar, so that it becomes alternately trans-
mitter and receiver, first being put to the mouth to receive sounds and then to the

ear to impart them. Now the operation of this apparatus depends upon the simple

fact that any motion of the diaphragm a alters the condition of the magnet field
surrounding the core b, and any alteration of the magnet field (that is, either strength-
ening or weakening) means the induction of a current of electricity in the coil c.
Moreover, the strength of this induced current depends upon the amplitude of the
vibration, and its form on the rate of vibration. The number of currents sent of

course depends upon the number of vibrations of the diaphragm. Now each current

induced in the coil c passes through the line wire to the coil c, and then it alters
the magnetization of the core &', increasing or diminishing its attraction for the iron
diaphragm a\ Hence the diaphragm a! is vibrated also, and every vibration of
the diaphragm a must be repeated on the diaphragm a' with a strength and
form that must vary exactly together. Hence, whatever sound produces the vibra-
tion of a is repeated by «', because its vibrations are an exact repetition of those

of a.

   It is quite evident, however, that Bell's telephone is limited in its range. The
currents operating it are very weak, and it is so sensitive to currents that, when at-
tached to a wire which passes in the neighbourhood of other wires, it is subject to
be acted upon by every current that passes through any one of those wires. Hence
on a busy line it emits sounds that are very like the pattering of hail against a
window, and which are so loud as to overpower the effects of the human voice.

  Now Mr. T. A. Edison, of New York, has endeavoured to remedy those defects in

Bell's by introducing a transmitter which is operated on by a battery-current, whoso

strength is made to vary directly with the quality and intensity of the human

voice. In carrying out his investigations in this field, he has discovered the curious
fact that the resistance of plumbago varies in some ratio inversely with the pressure
                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                37

brought to bear upon it. Starting from Reiss's

transmitter he simply substitutes for the platinum

point (d) asmall cylinder of plumbago, and he finds

that the resistance of this cylinder varies sulli-

ciently with the pressure of the vibration of the

diaphragm to cause the currents transmitted by

it to vary in form and strength to reproduce all

the varieties of the human voice. His receiver

also is novel and peculiar. In 1874 he discovered

that the friction between a platinum point and

moist chemically prepared paper varied every timo

a current passed between the two, so that the rate with which the paper moved was
Nowaltered at will.
                        by attaching to a resonator («) a spring (b), whose platinum

face (c) rested on the chemically prepared paper (d), whenever the drum (c) was

rotated and currents sent through the paper, the friction between c and e is so

modified that vibrations are produced in the resonator (a), and these vibrations are

an exact reproduction of those given out by the transmitter at the other station.

Edison's telephone, though not in practical use in America, is under trial. In

some experiments made with it, songs- and words were distinctly heard through

12,000 ohms, equal to the distance of 1000 miles of wire.

  Bell's telephone is,  however,  in  practical  use  in  Boston,  Providence,  and  New

^

York. There are several private lines that use it in Boston, and several more are

under construction. I tried two of them, and though we succeeded in conversing,

the result was not so satisfactory as experiments led one to anticipate. The inter-

ferences of working wires will seriously retard the employment of this apparatus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but there is no doubt that scientific inquiry and patient sidll will rapidly eliminate

all practical defects.

   To Professor Graham Bell must be accorded the full credit of being the first to
transmit the hiiman voice to distances beyond the reach of the ear and the eye by
means of electric currents.

ference 'beats'. These 'beats' are heard also if the forks be held one to each ear,

or if their sounds be conveyed separately to the ears with pipes. No combinational

tone is heard, however, when two forks of an interval of a fifth, third, or fourth

Aare held to the two ears and the intervals are harsh.                                       minor third produces thus

an intensely disagreeable sound. When two tones in unison but differing 180°

in phase are led to the two ears there does not appear to be any mutual destruction

of the tones, and both are heard. As there is no physical decussation of the auditory

nerves after leaving the fourth ventricle of the brain, the inference appears to be in

favour of a means of comparison existing within the structures of the brain itself.

The intention of the author was to furnish some materials for a correct estimate

of the reciprocal influence of land and sea on the temperature of the air in the

South-west of England, and inferentially on that of the more eastern districts. The

physical geography of the promontory of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles rendered

them interesting for their meteorology, and also as a scientific instrument from

Nature's workshop, hardly to be equalled elsewhere for displaying, and to some

extent measuring, the operation of most of the factors of climate. The stations

of observation were St. Mary's (Scilly), Penzance, Helston, St. Agnes, Truro, Ply-

mouth, Guernsey, and Greenwich, the latter as a generally recognized central

standard. The observations extended over four years. The mean highest

temperature was the same at Scilly and Penzance, namely, 71° Fahr. ; at Guern-

sey, which came next, it rose to 72°-70 ; at Helston it approached 79° ; at Truro it

was  nearly 78°                                          and at Plymouth 74°.  The mean lowest temperatures were St.

Mary and Penzance, again almost the same, 59°; Guernsey, 61°; Truro, 56-8°, nearly

the same as Greenwich. The absolute highest temperatures at Scilly and Penzance

were again much alike, namely, 74° and 75° ; Helston and Truro, 86° and 85° ; Guern-
sey, 785°, while at Greenwich it reached 91°-8, so that there was a difference of 16°

between the extremes of Scilly and Greenwich, and of 12° between places almost

adjacent, as Penzance and Helston. The absolute lowest summer temperature showed

a similar relative equability. With regard to sea temperature, it' was stated that the
mean temperature of surface-water at Scilly and round the Cornish coast in the height

of summer was 60°. Its influence was well shown in abstracting more than 8° from

the average heat of hot days in the ten miles between Helston and the shores of

Mount's Bay. There was scarcely any difference between Penzance and Scilly, in '

consequence of the almost island character of the peninsula ; but immediately they

got beyond the estuary, they got to a mainland climate, Helston being much higher

in summer and much lower in winter. That was the great reason why Penzance

was so suitable as a health resort, its climate, though not identical with that of

Scilly, having still a great analogy to it. The extreme cold recorded at Penzance

during 50 years was 23° ; occasionally, but very rarely, it fell to 26° ; and at Scilly
it was rarely below 29°. The mean temperature of the sea in the winter months

was  50°               and this, it was                  seen, penetrated      the  extreme  of  cold  in winter in the
                    ;

same way as it did the extreme of heat in summer. In the course of further obser-

vations Dr. Barham showed how much further inland the influence of the westerly

winds extended than that of the east winds.

The deductions drawn in the paper are from observations taken daily at 8 a.m.

for the past twelve years, viz. from 18G5 to 1876, both inclusive.

 --I. Atmospheric pressure The average is 29945 in. ; the months of greatest pres-

sure are June, 30-059, and July, 29-996 ; the months of least pressure are January and

October, both being 29'868 ; these months correspond with a great and small rainfall.

February and April to August have a mean pressure below the average, whilst the

other six months have a pressure above it. The mean monthly range is l - 074in.,
those of greatest range being January, February, November, and December, and
those of least range are July and August. The greatest ranges correspond to

--the months of least pressure and vice versd.
   II. Temperature. The coldest month is January, whose average is 42°-82 F.,

which  is  half  a degree lower than  December                                                   but the  nights of March are colder
                                                                                              ;

than those of February. The hottest month is July, whose average is 630, 56 P.,

which is about 1° F. higher than August. The lowest maximum I have recorded is

28° F. on 22nd December 1870, and the highest minimum 67° F. on 27th August

1869. The maximum temperature during the twelve years is 93° F. on 27th

June 1866. The minimum is 14° F. on 27th December 1869. The mean

daily range is 20° -74 F. ; the greatest daily range was on 27th April 1865,

when it was 44° F., with a maximum of 86° F. The least range was on 22nd
December 1870, when it was 2° F., with a maximum of 28° F. The averages,

according to the author's returns, agree with those published by the British

--Association from 1833-7, within one tenth of a degree.
   III. Wet and Dry Bulbs. The greatest difference between the bulbs is in June,

3°-79 F., and July, 3°-56 F. The least difference is in December, -89, and January,
·94. The relative humidity for May, June, and July is 79°-77 and 79° respectively,

whilst that for October is 93°. The greatest difference recorded by the author
between the bulbs is 15° on June 22nd, 1865, when the dry bulb was 78° and the

relative humidity was 41° ; but this occurred after several days of continuous

easterly winds.

 --IV. Rainfall. January has the greatest rainfall, as well as the greatest number

of rainy days, viz. 4*852 inches in 21*15 days. June has the least of each, viz.

1-375 inch in 9J days. September stands fifth in order of rainy days, but is

second in order of rainfall ; hence, if we neglect thunder-showers, our heaviest rains

Wemust occur in that month.      have nearly twice as much rainfall in the six

months from September to February as during the remaining six months ; whilst

Wethe number of rainy days is almost as 3 is to 2.                                               sometimes have heavy showers,

as on 29th July, 1871, when in less than half an hour three-quarters of an inch of

rain was registered; and sometimes, though rarely, suffer from want of rain, as, for

example, from 18th March to 2nd July, 1870, when, if we omit a thunder-shower

on 12th May, only l - 3 inches of rain fell in 106 clays ; but on the average we have

--Werain amounting to more than '1 inch every day.
V. Winds.        get 195 westerly to 144 easterly winds in the year, or the days

on which westerly winds and calms prevail are 20 per cent, more than those on

which easterly ones blow. The months of July and August have the greatest

number of westerly winds ; March, April, and May have the greatest number of
easterly winds. Winds of greatest violence blew in November, December, and

January.

                 We get 20-49 per cent, of winds from N. by E. to E.

and less violent than in the Midlands. No doubt a large portion of the atmospheric

electricity which is generated by the evaporation and friction of the waters of the

sea is silently discharged through our damp atmosphere, and thus eludes obser-

vation.

      Note on the Volumes of Solutions. By J. A. Ewing and J. Gordon

                                      MacGregor, M.A., D.Sc.

    In a paper by the authors, published in vol. xxvii. of the 'Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh,' containing an account of experiments on the density
and electrical conductivity of certain saline solutions, notice is directed to the fact
that the density of very weak solutions of sulphate of copper and sulphate of
zinc is greater than it would be on the hypothesis that the anhydrous part of the
salt dissolves without increase of volume in the whole of the water present, inclu-

ding the water of crystallization. On the other hand, the density of comparatively
strong solutions is less than this hypothesis would make it. From this it follows

that if a small quantity of one of these salts in the anhydrous state were added
to water it would cause contraction, while a large quantity of the salt would
produce expansion. The amount of such contraction, however, as indicated by
observations of density, was so small that the authors were unwilling to speak
positively as to its existence until they had applied a direct volumetric test.

They have now done so, with the result of confirming the deduction drawn from

their earlier experiments.

   The apparatus consisted of a large bottle 2744 c.cm. in capacity, through the cork
of which projected a vertical tube of OGG cm. bore. The bottle, as well as part of the
tube, was filled with distilled water, and the salt was introduced through the tube
in quantities of 10 grammes at a time. The resulting change of volume was shown
by the rise or fall of the liquid in the tube. In order to eliminate the effect of
variations of temperature, a second precisely similar bottle and tube were prepared
and filled with water, and the two were placed together in a large tub full of
water. The second bottle acted as a thermometer, and the expansion or con-
traction due to the introduction of the salts into the first bottle was indicated by
the difference between the changes of level in the two tubes. After the introduc-
tion of each dose of salt the bottle was rolled about for a time so as to secure
thorough diffusion and solution, and then an interval of at least six hours elapsed
before readings were taken, in order that the heat given out by the hydration of the
salt might be dissipated.

    The following results have been obtained in the case of anhydrous sulphate of

copper. The maximum contraction occurs when the proportion of anhydrous salt to

water is about 1 to 50, and the amount of contraction is then 0-00043 of the original
volume of water. As more salt is added, the solution begins to expand, and
with 1 part of salt to 18 of water the volume is equal to that of the water originally
 present. After this, any further addition of salt produces expansion beyond the
           TRANSACTION^ Of THE SECTIONS.                                 41

original volume. The rate of expansion per unit quantity of salt appears to in-

crease continually, but at first it is negative.

   The above numbers are given subject to correction by more elaborate experi-
ments which are now going on. The authors hope to extend the inquiry to other
salts. They have already examined the behaviour of anhydrous sulphate of soda

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but with that salt no contraction whatever has been observed, the solutions expand
rapidly from the first.

On some Points connected with the Chemical Constituents of the Solar System.

      By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.E.S., President of the Chemical Society.

   The discoveries of the spectroscope, and the general advance of knowledge of the

heavenly bodies, have greatly confirmed the nebular theory of the creation of worlds.

Assuming a nebulous mass of many chemical elements gradually condensing to a
centre, how should we find these elements distributed ? The least volatile would
form the liquid or solid nucleus, while the others would arrange themselves accord-

ing to their volatility, condensing into cloud at various distances from the intensely
heated centre. Also, as Mr. Johnstone Stoney has shown, the gases would arrange
themselves according to their relative density, the lightest gases being at the out-
side. In neither case, however, would the separation of the constituents be perfect
for mechanical movements and diffusion will always cause some portions of the

less volatile bodies or denser gases to rise into the upper region. This is actually
what is taking place in the sun at present.

   Supposing the solar system to have been originally a great revolving nebula of
this description condensing to a central sun, and forming from its outer portions
smaller masses, such as the planets and their satellites, or the comets and meteorites,

we may expect these to consist principally of the more volatile or the lightest
elements with smaller portions of the less volatile or heavier ones. On arranging
the elements of which the earth is composed according to the known or presumed

density of their vapours, it is found that such is actually the case.

   The plentiful elements, whether non-metallic or metallic, have always low atomic
weights ; the less plentiful ones are generally heavier, and the very rare ones have

almost invariably high densities.

   This is still more strikingly the case with reference to the meteoric stones, which
are composed, almost without exception, of elementary substances which are light
when in the gaseous condition, viz. iron, nickel, chromium, oxygen, sulphur,
silicon, magnesium, calcium, sodium, carbon, hydrogen.

  Among the circumstances which interfere with the universality of this rule

are the great changes in density and volatility that are brought about by chemical
combination ; and the chemistry of the surface of our globe is but little guide to
the compounds that exist at the high temperature at which meteorites, and proba-

bly our own earth, were formed.

   Reasons were assigned for believing that the self-luminous heads of comets are
not composed of carbon vapour, but rather of incandescent compounds of that

substance.

             Address by Professor Abel, F.R.S., President of the Section.

The subject which my predecessor, in the honourable position of President of this

Section, made the chief topic of his interesting- and instructive Address, affords
excellent illustrations of the operation of purely scientific research in creating- and
developing important branches of industry. Mr. Perkin, whose name has from
the very commencement of the history of coal-tar colours been identified wit li their
discovery and their scientific and technical history, referred to several series of
researches, each one of which formed a link in a chain of discoveries in organic

chemistry of the highest value as establishing, illustrating, or extending important
chemical theories, but at the time, and for long afterwards, of value purely from a
scientific point of view. These researches, undertaken and pursued by ardent and
philosophical investigators under more or less formidable difficulties, and solely in
the interests of science, resulted in the discovery of certain organic bodies which
were produced originally only on a very small scale and at great cost, but which,
after the lapse of years, have been readily manufactured from abundant sources,
and have constituted important elements in the development of the industry of
artificial colouring-matters. In fact this industry, which owes its origin to the

discovery of mauve by Mr. Perkin about twenty years ago, and which is second
to no branch of chemical industry in regard to the rapidity of its development and
its influence upon other important branches of manufacture, affords more copious
illustrations thau any other of the immediate influence of pure science upon indus-
trial progress. It therefore affords a topic which the chemist may well be excused
for continually recurring to, with an interest bordering on enthusiasm, when
illustrating the material advantages which accrue to communities from the pro-
motion of scientific training and the encouragement of chemical research.

                                                                                                    4*
--44 repokt 1877.

The iron-and-steel industry presents a great contrast to that of the artificial

colours in regard to the extent of influence which the labours of purely scientific

investigators have exerted upon its development. The efforts of scientific men to

unravel such problems as, for instance, the true chemical constitution of steel, or

the precise differences between the various combinations known as cast iron, and

the conditions which determine their individual production or conversion from

one to another, have hitherto been attended by results not at all proportionate to

the patient experimental investigation of which from time to time they have been

made the subject. Thus the protracted experiments and discussion carried on by

Frenvy and Oaron, some years back, with reference to the dependence of the

characteristics of steel upon the existence in it of nitrogen, cannot be said to have

led to results of a more conclusive or even definite nature regarding the conditions

which regulate the production, composition, and properties of steel than those

arrived at by previous distinguished experimenters ; and the same must be said,

with respect to cast iron, of such experiments as those carried on for several years

by Matthiessen (in which I also took some part) under the auspices of the Associa-

tion, with the view to eliminate many existing points of doubt regarding the

chemical constitution of cast iron, by preparing chemically pure iron and studying

its combination with carbon and other elements occurring in cast iron.

The prosecution of purely scientific investigation may therefore of itself fail to

bear direct fruit in regard to the development of new metallurgic achievements, or

even to the elucidation of the comparatively complicated and numerous reactions

which occur in furnaces, either simultaneously or in rapid and difficultly controllable

succession, between materials composed of a variety of constituents in variable

proportions. There can, however, be no question regarding the important benefits

which have accrued from the application of chemical knowledge to the study and

the perfection of furnace-operations by those who happily combine that knowledge

with practical experience and with the power of putting to the test of actual prac-

tice the results of reasoning upon an intelligent observation of the phenomena

exhibited in such operatious, and upon the data which chemical analysis has

furnished. In the hands of such men, the scientific results arrived at by Karsten,

Berthier, Bunsen, Scheerer, Percy, and other eminent investigators acquire new

value, and by them the fruits of the labours of the patient toiler at analytical pro-

cesses meets with that appreciation which their solid and permanently valuable

work does not always command at the hands of their numerous brother-workers

in chemical science who follow the far more attractive paths of organic research.

Naturally, the brilliant results achieved from time to time by investigators in

organic chemistry, the rapidity with which, by those results, theories are esta-

blished or extended, types founded, their offspring multiplied, and their connexion
with other families traced and developed, impart to organic research a charm

peculiarly its own. This, and the general ease with which new results are obtained

by the pursuit of methods of research comparatively simple in their nature and few
in kind, have for many years not only secured to organic chemistry an overwhelming

majority of workers                                                                                              they also  appear to  have had a tendency to lead the younger
                                                                                                              ;

labourers in the field of organic research to underestimate the value and importance,

in reference tothe advancement of science, of the labours of the plodding investi-

gator of analysis. Yet no higher example can be furnished of the patient pursuit

of scientific work, purely for its own sake, than that of the deviser or improver of

analytical processes, who, undeterred by failure upon failure, indefatigably pursues

bis laborious work, probing to its foundation each possible source of error, care-

fully comparing the results he obtains with those furnished by other methods of

analysis, and patiently accumulating experimental data till they suffice fully to

establish the value and trustworthiness of the process which he then publishes for

the benefitof his fellow-workers in science. Truly the results of such labours do

not stand in unfavourable contrast, from whatever light they may be viewed, to

those of the investigator of organic chemistry. It is not to be denied that the

labourer at organic research may, so far as the analytical work which should fall

to his share in the course of his                                                                                           investigations is  concerned,  be  tempted to reduce
            _

 operation of the simplest kind, such as the examination of a platinum-salt,

obtained a numerical result approximating to that which his theory demands, may

 hasten on to the further development of his airy structure, possibly not without

risk to its stability. Unquestionably there are instances of frequent occurrence, in
the pursuit of a particular line of organic research, in which more is not required
than the identification of a particular product by some such simple means as above

indicated. It is certain, moreover, that the labours of the organic investigator

also not unfrequently afford bright examples of indomitable perseverance under
formidable difficulties ; and this alone should constitute a strong bond of union

between the worker in organic research and his brother-worker in analytical
chemistry, if one did not already exist in the active interest which each, if a true

lover of science, must take in the work of the other.

   It has been remarked by one of the most distinguished investigators, and, at the
same time, one of the most brilliant lecturers and successf id teachers of our time,

that the contrivance of a new and good lecture experiment may rank hi import-
ance with the preparation of a new organic compound ; and it may certainly be
said with equal truth that the elaboration of a new and good method of analysis
may rank in importance with a good research in organic chemistry, in reference

both to the part it plays in the advancement of science and to its influence upon

industrial progress.

   An excellent illustration of this is afforded by reference to the Proceedings of

the British Association when it met in this town thirty-six years ago. In a letter
to Dr. Playfair, Liebig, who took a very active part in the proceedings of the
Association in the earlier years of its existence, reports that Doctors Will and
Varrentrapp have devised an excellent method for determining the amount of

nitrogen hi organic bodies, "very exact and easily performed." He then describes

in a few lines the process so well known to chemists, which not only has been, and
continues to be, invaluable to those engaged in organic research, but which, as may
be testified by such researches as those of Lawes and Gilbert, has borne a most
important and indispensable part in the advancement of agricultural chemistry. It is,

I believe, but an expression of the unanimous conviction of chemists to say that the

achievements in analytical chemistry of such men as Berzelius, Heinrich Eose, and

Fresenius take equal rank with the brilliant researches and theoretical expositions
of such chemists as Liebig, Laurent, Gerhardt and Berthelot, and that, of all the

important contributions to the development of organic chemistry which we owe to

Liebig, there is none which has exerted so great an influence on the progress of
this branch of chemical science as his beautifully simple method of organic elemen-

tary analysis.

   "Reverting to the industry of iron and steel, which, in regard to some of its most
important branches, cannot fail to be a subject of special interest in Plymouth and

Devonport, it is not difficult to demonstrate that the labours of the analytical
chemist have exercised, and continue to exert, an important influence on the very
considerable advance which has in recent years been made, and still proceeds,
towards securing complete control over the quality and character of the products

obtained. The epoch is well within the recollection of chemists of my generation

when the British ironmaster first awoke to the benefits which might accrue to him

from an application of the labours of the analytical chemist in connexion with iron-

smelting. When the last great stride was made in the manufacture of cast iron, by

the introduction of the hot blast, the iron-smelter was naturally led to seek profit, to
the fullest extent, with respect both to the great increase in the rate of production
of pig-iron attainable thereby, and to the economy achievable in regard to_ the
proportions and characters of the materials employed in the production of pig-iron.
But after a time, the great falling off* in the quality of a large proportion of the
products of the blast-furnace, and the difficulties experienced in the production of
malleable iron of even very moderate quality, aided by the great impetus to
competition, in respect of quality, given by the first International Exhibition in
1851, directed the attention of our more enlightened ironmasters to the likelihood
of their deriving important aid from chemical science, and more especially from

the investigations of the analytical chemist.

   Amorjg the earliest to realize the importance of trustworthy and detailed in-

formation regarding the Composition of the iron ores of the country was Mr. S. IT.
Blackwell, who, in presenting to the Royal School of Mines a very extensive and
interesting series of British ores, which he had collected with great labour and
expense for exhibition in 1851, placed at the disposal of Dr. Percy the requisite
funds for engaging the services of competent analysts (Messrs. J. Spiller and
A. H. Dick), who, under his direction and with subsequent pecuniary aid from
himself and from Government fimds, carried out a very careful and complete exami-
nation of this series, the results of which have been of great value for purposes
of reference to those actively interested in the iron industry. It was, however,
the first connexion of Messrs. Nicholson and D. S. Price and of Mr. E. Riley
with two of the most important iron-works of this country, about a quarter of a
century ago {i.e. at the time when the above investigation was commenced), that
marked, I believe, the commencement of systematic endeavours to apply the results
of analytical research to the improvement and regulation of the quality of the

products of our iron-works.
    It is, perhaps, but natural that the primary object sought by application of

the knowledge of the analytical chemist should have been to eliminate or reduce
the existing elements of uncertainty in obtaining the most abundant yield of pig-

iron capable of conversion into railway bnr sufficiently good to meet the minimum

standard of quality, and to reduce still further the cost of production of such bar
iron by utilizing materials concerning the composition of which (richness in iron,
&c.) the iron-smelter was completely in the dark. The information accumulated
by the analyst respecting the composition of the ores, fuel, and fluxes available
at the works, and the composition of the pig-iron and slags (or cinders) produced
under varied conditions, in regard to materials employed and to the proportions of
ore, fuel, and flux used in the blast-furnace, could not, however, exist long without
exerting a marked beneficial influence upon the quality of the iron produced, and
generally upon the iron industry of the country.

   Percy's invaluable work of reference on metallurgy furnishes abundant evidence

of the scientifically interesting, as well as practically useful, nature of the results

obtained at that time by the chemists above named, and others, worlring under
Dr. Percy, with respect both to the elaboration of important analytical processes
(in which direction Mr. Riley has continued to the present day to do valuable
work) and to the elucidation of the reactions occurring in the processes of reduc-
tion and refining of the metal. It is needless to dwell upon the fact that the aid

of the analyst has now long since become absolutely indispensable to the iron and
steel manufacture ; but I may perhaps be allowed briefly to refer to one or two

recent illustrations of the indispensable part which analytical research has played
and continues to play in the extension of our knowledge of the chemical reactions
involved in the production of cast and wrought iron and of steel, and of the influ-
ences which the chief associates of iron in its mercantile forms exert upon its

 physical characters.

   Among the many valuable communications made to that most important body,
the Iron and Steel Institute of Great Britain, by men who combine great practical

 knowledge and experience in iron and steel manufacture with high attainments in
mechanical science and such knowledge of chemical science as ensures a full appre-
 ciation of its value at their hands, one of the most interesting and suggestive to the
 chemist is that on the separation of carbon, sulphur, silicon, and phosphorus in the
 refining- and puddling-furnace, and in the Bessemer converter, contributed to the
Transactions of the Institute's recent meeting by Mr. Lowthian Bell, whose valuable
 investigations in connexion with the iron industry are as interesting to the chemist
 as they are usefid to the manufacturer. Mr. Bell has brought together the results
 of an extensive series of practical experiments on the treatment of different kinds

 of pig-iron of known composition in the finery, the puddling-furnace, and the

 Bessemer converter, and, by comparing the results of analytical investigation of
 the products of those experimental operations with each other and with those of
 the materials operated upon, he has obtained valuable confirmation of the views
 already held by metallurgic chemists regarding the succession in which carbon,

 silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus are attacked when pig metal is submitted to the
TRANSACTIONS <>!·' THE SECTIONS.  47

above purifying processes, and the extent to which these foreign associates of iron
are abstracted, or resist removal, by the more or less thorough application of those

several modes of treatment. He has also thrown new light on the reason why the

most difficultly assailable impurity, phosphorus, obstinately resists all attempts
to effect even a slight diminution in its amount, by application of the Bessemer
treatment. The earnestness with which Mr. Bell wages war against this enemy of
the ironmaster, in one of its most favourite haunts, the Cleveland District, not simply
with the old British pluck which acknowledges not defeat, but systematically on
scientific principles, calling to his aid all the resources which the continual advances

in applied mechanical and chemical research place within his reach, cannot fail to

contribute importantly, if it does not of itself directly lead, to the complete subjec-
tion of this most intractable of the associates to which iron becomes linked in the

blast-furnace. Indications have lately not been wanting that the existence of

phosphorus in very notable proportions in iron may not of necessity be inimical to
its conversion into steel of good quality ; and it may be that this element, which is
now turned to usefid account to impart particular characteristics to the alloys of

copper and tin, is even destined to play a distinctly useful part in connexion with
the production of steel possessed of particular characters, valuable for some special

purposes.

   In the great development which steel manufacture has received within the last
few years, one most prominent feature has been the production with precision, upon
a large scale, of steel of desired characteristics, in regard to hardness &c, by first
adding to fluid cast iron of known composition the requisite proportion of a rich
iron ore (with or without the addition of scrap iron) to effect a reduction of the
carbon to the desired amount, concurrent with a refining of the metal by the

oxidizing action of the ore, and then giving to the resulting steel the desired special

qualities by the addition of suitable proportions of iron compounds of known com-

position, rich in manganese and carbon (Spiegeleisen and the similar product called

feiTO-manganese). The germ of this system of producing steel-varieties of prede-
termined characteristics exists in crucible processes like that of Uchatius, which
have been in more or less extensive use for many years past ; but it is to such
invaluable arrangements as are most prominently represented in the Siemens-
Martin furnace, wherein several tons of metal may be fused and maintained at a
very high temperature with as little liability to change from causes not under
control as if the operation were conducted in a crucible, that we are indebted for
the very great expansion which the direct application of the analytical chemist's
labours to the development of the steel industry is now receiving.

    The production of steel upon the open hearth, to the elaboration of which Dr.

C. W. Siemens has so largely contributed, since he first established the process at

Llandore in 1868, has, in fact, become assimilated in simplicity of character and

precision of results to a laboratory operation, and may be justly regarded as a

triumph of the successful application of chemical principles, and of the power of
guidance and control afforded by utilizing analytical research, to the attainment of
prescribed results upon a stupendous scale, with an accuracy approaching that
which the experienced chemical operator secures in the laboratory upon a small
scale, under conditions which he can completely control. The production of steel

by a large number of small separate operations in pots has now become supplanted
with great advantage hy the Siemens-Martin system of working at some of our

 largest establishments at Sheffield ; this system has also secured a footing at highly

renowned continental works, which are formidable competitors with us in the manu-
facture of steel, such as those of Essen, Creusot, and Terrenoire. It is specially
interesting to notice that, in the hands of those who, on the Continent at least equally
 with ourselves, have learned to combine the results of practical experience with
 the teachings of chemical science, the facilities now existing for dealing in a single
 receptacle with large masses of fluid steel have greatly facilitated the application
 of chemical means to the production of solid masses of considerable size, thereby

 reducing, if not altogether dispensing with, the necessity for submitting large steel
 castings to costly mechanical operations, with the object of closing up cavities

 caused by the escape of occluded gas as the liquid metal cools. The success i

this direction which appears to have attended the addition of silicon, in combination
with iron and manganese, to the steel before casting, in preventing- the formation

 of so-called llaic-Iiv/es, and in contributing at the same time to the production of

 the particular character of steel required, bids fair to be of special importance iu

 connexion with the application of steel to the production of projectiles for use
 against armour plates, as affording ready and comparatively very economical means

 of ensuring the production of perfectly sound castings, which, in compactness of struc-

 ture, will, it is asserted, compete successfully with carefully forged castings, and

even with the magnificent material which Whitworth produces by submitting the

 fluid metal to powerful pressure.

    The part which silicon plays, by its comparatively high susceptibility to oxidation,
 in promoting the production of sound steel castings is readily intelligible ; but the
 functions of the manganese compounds, which are an indispensable adjunct to the
 Bessemer process, and the application of which has become an integral part of

 steel manufacture, are still far from being thoroughly understood ; and there is
 ample scope for chemical research, in co-operation with practical experiment, in the

 further study of the influence not only of manganese in the production and upon
 the properties of steel, but also of elements such as titanium, tungsten, and boron,
 and of chromium, which exists, associated in considerable quantities with iron, in a
 very abundant Tasmanian ore, to which prominent attention has lately been directed.
 The achievements of the mechanical engineer have so facilitated the handling and
 perfected the means of production and the mechanical treatment of malleable iron

 and of steel, that the full advantage may now be reaped of any improvement of a
 chemical nature which may be effected in the production of those materials; and it

 must be a source of pride to the chemist to observe with what success the teach-
 ings of his science are being applied by practical men of the present day in the

 construction of furnaces capable of withstanding the high temperatures required for
 the production and working of iron and steel in large masses, and in combining the
 perfect consumption and consequent great economy of fuel with the attainment of
 those high temperatures and with a thorough control over the character of the
 gaseous agents to which the fluid metal is exposed in the furnace. I need not quote

 the names of those men who have already rendered themselves prominent by their
 services in this particular direction, but may refer, in special illustration of the residts

 achieved by purely practical men, to the success in applying very simple furnace-
 arrangements to the attainment of the above residts which has recently attended

 the labours of Mr, William Price, a principal Foreman in the Eoyal Gun Factories
 at Woolwich

   A few of the experiments made in the early clays of the application of armouring

 to ships and forts appeared to demonstrate, on the one hand, that steel was quite
 incapable of competing with malleable iron, of even very moderate quality, as a
 material for armour plates, and, on the other hand, that'the penetrative power of
 projectiles made of chilled iron, upon the Palliser system, could not be surpassed,
 or even attained, with any degree of certainty, by projectiles of steel, produced at
 comparatively very great cost. But some recent results obtained on the Continent,
 and especially iu the course of the important experiments instituted by the Italian
 Government at Spezzia, have afforded decisive indications that steel, the application
  of which to the construction of ordnance has since that time been very greatly ex-
 tended, may now be looked to hopefully as capable of affording greater protection
 against the enormous projectiles of the present day than can be seemed by propor-
 tionately large additions to the stupendous iron-armouring of the most modern
 ironclads, and also as applicable, at a cost very moderate when compared with that
  often years ago, to the production of projectiles of large dimensions superior in
  point of penetrative power, and of uniformity in this respect, to those of chilled
  iron, the difficulties hi the production of which are very greatly increased by the
 formidable increase which has lately been made in their size. Promising results
 have also_ quite recently been obtained at Shoeburynese with a new system of apply-
  ing steel in conjunction with malleable iron, by' which a perfect union of masses
  of the two materials at one of their surfaces is effected by the aid of heat.

     The superiority of soft aud very homogeneous steel over wrought iron of the

beet quality, iu regard to lightness combined with strength and toughness, is lead-
ing to its very advantageous employment in the construction of a particular class of

vessels for the Navy ; and the perfect confidence which can he placed in the unifor-
mity, in structure and strength, of steel of such character as is produced by the
Whitworth system of manufacture has greatly facilitated the production of air-

chambers of small weight, but capable of being quite safely charged with sufficient
air, under a pressure of 1000 lb. on the square inch, to carry the Whitehead tor-
pedo through water to the distance of a thousand yards in little more than a
minute and a half.

   Thus the results of the recent development of the steel-industry, to which the
labours of the chemist have not unimpi irtantiy contributed, give promise of exerting
a great influence upon the resources of nations for defence and attack. Although
the necessity for the continual expansion of such resources cannot but be deeply
deplored, there can be no doubt that the problems which it presents, and the
special requirements to which it gives rise, must operate, and perhaps as importantly
as the demands created by peaceful industries and commercial enterprise, in en-
couraging the metallurgist, the chemist, and the engineer to continue their com-
bined work in following up the successes, to the achievement of which the results
of scientific research have greatly though indirectly contributed.

   If it were necessary to add to the illustrations which Mr. Perkm gave in his
Address last year of the practical fruits of research in organic chemistry, I might be
tempted to dilate upon the important results which have, especially during the last
ten years, grown out of the discovery and study of the products of the action of
nitric acid upon cellulose and glycerine. During the six years which have elapsed
since I had the honour of bringing before the members of the British Association
the chief points of scientific interest and practical importance presented by the his-
tory of those remarkable bodies, their application to technical and war purposes has
been greatly developed. Nitroglycerine and gun-cotton may now be justly classed
among the most interesting examples of the practical importance frequently

attained by the results of chemical research, while the history of the successive
steps by which their safe manipulation and efficient application have been developed
affords more than one striking illustration of the achievements effected, by com-
bined physical and chemical research, in the solution of problems of high scientific
interest and practical importance, and in the vanquishment of difficulties so for-
midable as, for a time, to appear fatal to the attainment of permanently practical

success.

   It is to a careful study of the influence which the physical characters of gun-
powder (its density, hardness, &c.) and its mechanical condition (/. e. form and size
of the masses and condition of their surfaces) exert upon the rapidity of the ex-
plosion under confinement that we chiefly owe the very important advance which
has been made of late years in controlling its explosive force, in its application as
a propelling agent, and the consequent simple and effectual means whereby the

violence of action of the enormous charges now used in siege- and ship-guns is

effectually reduced to within their limits of endurance, without diminution of the
total explosive force developed. But, concurrently with these important practical
results, the application of combined chemical and physical research to a very ex-
tended and comprehensive investigation of the action of fired gunpowder has
furnished results which possess considerable interest from a purely scientific point

of view, as in many respects modifying, in others supplementing, the conclusions

based upon earlier experiments and theoretical considerations with respect to the
nature and proportions of the products formed, the heat developed by the explosion,
the tension of the products of combustion and the conditions which regulate it,

both when the explosion is brought about in a close vessel and when it occurs in the
boreofaguu. The residts of these physico-chemical researches have, moreover,
already acquired practical importance in regard to the light they have thrown upon
the influence exerted by variable conditions of a mechanical nature upon the action
of, and pressure developed by, fired gunpowder iu the bore of a gun, and in demon-

strating that modifications in the composition of gunpowder, not unimportant from

an economical point of view in dealing with the very large charges now employed,
may importantly contribute to render the storing of the maximum of work in the
projectile, when propelled from a gun, compatible with a subjection of the gun to

comparatively veiy moderate and uniform strains.

Other interesting illustrations of the intimate manner in which physical and chemi-

cal research are linked together, and of the important extent to which some of our

most illustrious workers in chemistry have contributed to demolish the semblance

of a barrier which existed in past times between the two branches of Science, are

furnished and suggested by the recently published list of grants of money which

the Government has made to scientific men, on the recommendation of the Royal

Society, from the fund which, for the first time last year, was added to the very

modest sum previously accorded from national resources in support of research.

The perusal of that list, representing as it does a most carefully considered selec-

tion by the highest representatives of science in the country, from a very large

number of applications, affords important evidence, on the one hand, of the

active pursuit of science in Great Britain and, on the other, of the very wide range

of subjects of interest and importance, the full investigation of which demands the

provision of adequate resources. That the necessity for such resources needs but

to be thoroughly made known to ensure their provision, even from other than

national sources, has been demonstrated by the success which, in a comparatively

biief space of time, has attended the efforts of the Chemical Society to establish,

upon the foundation patriotically laid by one of its original members, Dr. Longstaff,

a special Fund, to be administered by the Society, for the advancement of Chemi-

Ancal Science.  inspection of the list of contributors to this special Fund in aid of

chemical research, which, in about two years, has reached the sum of four thousand

pounds, and from the proceeds of which the first applications for grants have

recently been met, is suggestive of two observations : one is, that the proportion

and amount of contributions hitherto received are comparatively small from the

source whence the greatest support of such a Fund may naturally be looked fi >r,
namely, from those who most directly benefit by the results of chemical research.

It is to be hoped that there are many prominent representatives of the Chemical

and Metallurgic Industries in this country who still intend to give practical effect

to their natural desire to aid in the advancement of Chemical Science, and to the

appreciation which they can hardly fail to entertain of the usefulness of this Fund.

On the other hand, it is a matter well meriting special notice that a very prominent

section of the contributors to the Fund is composed of some of the most ancient

corporate bodies of the City of London. Most welcome evidence is thereby afforded

of the readiness with which the City Companies are prepared to respond to appeals

for the substantial support of measures well calculated to promote progress in

science. This evidence, and the combined action which they are even now con-

templating for promoting the application of scientific research to the advancement

of industry and commerce, by establishing an Institution for technical education

                         By Professor J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S.

   Mr. Latimer Clark had sent the author some specimens of candles recovered
from the wreck of a vessel sunk off the Spanish coast in 1702. They had remained
submerged till 1875, a period of 173 years.

   The wick has rotted away, leaving scarcely any trace of its existence, while the
fatty portion has become a friable heavy substance of a dull white colour. The
candles bore evidence of having been made by dipping, for the concentric layers
were easily separated from one another. Beth the outer and inner portions still
contain some of the fat apparently unchanged ; they are unctuous to the touch and
have a fatty odour. The fat can be easily separated from the rest by treating the
altered candles with ether.

    After combustion there remained a strongly alkaline white ash, consisting of
carbonate and chloride of calcium and sodium, with traces of magnesium and

potassium. From the details of the analysis it appears that the fat has been con-
verted in great measure into calcium and sodium salts, doubtless by the slow
replacement of the triatomic group C ,11- in the stearino by 3 atoms of the metal,
with the simultaneous production of glycerine. Though the calcium in sea-water
is far less abundant than the sodium, it appears to have had a much greater effect
and it is of course impossible to say whether the one salt has not been made by
double decomposition from the other. The author pointed out as a most interesting
fact, that whereas the fat has been in contact with a practically unlimited amount

of sea-water for 173 years, and a chemical cbange between them has been possible,

the double decomposition has proceeded so extremely slowly that the reaction is
only about half completed at the present time.

  On tlie Application of a new Unit of Light to the Examination of Coal-gas.

                       By A. Yernon Harcottrt, M.A., F.B.S.

  --After pointing out the variations to which the unit of light now in use a sperm
--candle burning 120 grains of sperm per hour is liable, and the irrelevance, for the

purpose of estimating the value of illuminating gas, of tests affected by any other
portions of the force radiating from aflame besides those which produce vision, the

author explained the application of the new unit of light to the examination of coal-
gas. By making a mixture in a small gasholder of the most volatile spirit from
American petroleum, which distilled at 50° C, with ordinary air, in the proportion of

one of the liquid to 600 of air, or seven of the vapour to twenty of air, he prepared
a gas which was scarcely at all soluble in water, and was permanent at ordinary
temperatures. and pressures. This gas was burnt at a pair of burners, corresponding
to the two candles commonly used in photometry, each consisting of a brass tube
surmounted by a plate through which the standard gas issued at the rate of half a
cubic foot per hour, through an opening one quarter of an inch across. The
illuminating power of the gas and the rate of burning were so adjusted that each
burner gave the average light of one candle. Photometric results obtained with
the same sample of coal-gas showed that successive observations made with standard
gas gave closely corresponding results.

On Hcderic Acid and Resin of Scammony. By Charles T. Kingzett, F.C.S.

   In a paper " On some new lleactions in Organic Chemistry and their Ultimate
Bearings ; '*, the author, in conjunction with Dr. H. W. Hake, has described a

number of instances in which bodies (for instance, camphor) give with strong sul-
phuric acid and sugar a violet-coloured product. Other bodies give this colour
with sulphuric acid without the addition of sugar ; and by means of these reac-
tions the constitution of many substances may be in a measure predicted.

   Huderic acid C,aH26 4 (Possett; also Davies), a constituent of ivy-leaves, gives

this colour-test with sulphuric acid; also in a less degree does resin of scam-
mony. In the present paper the author has described the processes by which he
has isolated glucose from the respective substances, thus confirming the hypo-
thesis given in his original paper above alluded to. Incidentally it is shown that the
root of Convolvulus scammonia contains no alkaloid; and some information is given

regarding a volatile oil obtained below 00° C. on distillation of scammony resin.

Preliminary Account of the Alkaloids from Japanese Aconite.

By B. H. Paul, Ph.D., F.C.S. , and C. T. Kingzett, F.C.S.

The authors have isolated from Japanese Aconite an alkaloid of the formula

NO29 II,i3    which  is  crystalline,  but  does not  form  crystallizable  salts.  It is further

            a,

shown that when the alkaloidal principle is extracted by means of Duquesnel's pro-

cess, it is accompanied by the salt of an alkaloid, perhaps aeonitrate of aconitine

and from this it is suggested that the so-called aconitine obtained and analyzed

by Wright and others has never been obtained absolutely pure, being probably

a variable mixture of the alkaloid with the above salt.

On an Improved System of Alkali Manufacture. By James Macteak, F.C.S.

 --The author claims for this system these advantages : 1. By its use the output

of the furnaces had been increased from 50 to 70 per cent. 2. That there is a

large saving both during lixiviation and in coal. 3. That there is a much re-

duced quantity of waste. 4. That there is a considerably increased yield of alkali
from a given amount of sulphate of soda. 5. That there is a considerable saving in

wages. This new process has been widely adopted in Great Britain, and is also

very successfully used in France.

                    On the Action of various Fatty Oils upon Copper.

                           By William H. Watson, F.C.S.

   This communication enumerates a number of experiments showing the extent
to which ten different oils act upon copper. The conclusions arrived at are that
paraffin oil and castor oil have the least action upon copper, while the action of
sperm oil and seal oil is but slight. The rest of the oils examined (linseed, olive,
almond, colza, sesame, and neat's-foot) all acted considerably upon copper, and the
action of linseed oil was especially great.

   The author concludes, from experiments, that the comparative action of different
oils cannot, in all cases, be correctly decided upon from the a^earances of the oils'
after exposure to copper plates, though minute quantities of the metal may be easily
detected in most oils from the colour produced.

from the winter-quarters of the second ship of the Expedition, II.M.S. 'Discovery,'

The coal occurs in the side of a narrow mountain-gorge in the form of a slight

saddleback, thickest in the centre, and becoming continually smaller towards each

end                   the         seam was exposed on the N.W.       side of  the gorge   for      a considerable dis-
                   ;

tance                        the  thickness  of  the  seam  at  the  deepest  visible  portion  was  25  feet.  Neither
                          ;

the bottom of the seam nor the underlying strata were visible at any place ; the

height, from the top of the seam to the surface of the ground above the gorge, was

about 30 feet. Above the coal was a shale containing numerous impressions of

Miocene plants. The seam is almost uniform in character and free from clayey

veins. The prevailing rock of the surrounding district is a shingly clay-stone,

somewhat similar to the red Miocene rock of the Disco Coal-beds.

The coal has a bright shiny appearance, looking somewhat of a pitchy character

it is very brittle, but possesses a slight cleavage, sometimes having a conchoidal

fracture. When finely powdered it is of a brown colour, which is the case with

most bituminous coals. Here and there small particles of iron pyrites were

observable. The following is the result of several analyses :

These figures indicate a coal of very good quality, and of very much the same

character as the coal from some of the English coal-fields.
   The Arctic coal gives about 65 per cent, of coke, which exhibits a very slight

amount of caking. The ash is white and bulky, and contains silica and alumina,
with a little free lime, present no doubt in the coal as carbonate, also a very small
quantity of iron. The calorific value is high. The coal can readily be obtained
by the process of quarrying ; and the author points out the probable use which
would be made of it by any future expedition.

   It is probable that this coal is one of those which, although in reality Miocene,
approach in their character very nearly to true Carboniferous coals. For the
details regarding the position in which the coal is found the author is indebted to
Dr. Coppinger, late of H.M.S. ' Discovery.'

      Address by W. Penoellt, F.B.S., F.O.S., President of the Section.

When, as long ago as 1841, the British Association made its only previous visit to
Plymouth, some of us, now amongst its oldest members, thought ourselves too

young to take any part in its proceedings. If the effects of that meeting are still
traceable in this district, it will be admitted, of course, that the seed then sown
was of excellent quality and that it fell on good soil. Be this as it may, the hope

may be cherished that thirty-six years will not again be allowed to elapse between
two consecutive visits to the capital of the two south-western counties.
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  55

One effect of this wide hiatus is the loss of almost all the human linkswhose

presence on this occasion would have pleasantly connected the present with the.

Apast,  glance at the lists of Trustees and the General, Sectional, and Local

officers in 1841 will show that the presence of scarcely one of them can bo hoped
for on this occasion ; and there is but little probability that any of those who pre-

pared Reports or Papers for the last Plymouth Meeting will have done so for that

which is now assembled.

Nor are these the only changes. In 1841 Section C embraced, as at the beginning,

the Geographers as well as the Geologists ; but ten years later the geographers were

ili-tached, whether to find room for themselves, or to make room for the students

of an older geography, it is not necessary to inquire.

   Some years afterwards came an innovation which, until entering on the preparation
of this address, I always regarded as a decided improvement. The first Presidential
Address to this Section was delivered at Leeds in 1858 by the late Mr. Hopkins,
so well known to geologists for his able application of his great mathematical

powers to sundry important problems in their Science ; and from that time to the
present, with the exception of the Meetings of 18G0 and 1870 only, tbe President

of this Section has delivered an address.

  None of the local geological papers read in 1841 appear to have attracted so much

attention as those on Lithodomous Perforations, Raised Beaches, Submerged Forests,

and Caverns (see 'Athenaeum ' for 7th to 28th of August, 1841); and, as an effort to

connect the present -with the past, I have decided on taking up one of these threads,

and devoting tbe remarks I have now to offer to the History of Cavern-Explora-

tion in Devonshire. I am not unmindful that there were giants in those days ; and

no one can deplore more than I do our loss of Buckland and De la Beche, amongst

many others; nor can I forget the enormous strides opinion has made since 1841,

when, in this Section, Dr. Buckland " contended that human remains had never

been found under such circumstances as to prove their contemporaneous existence

with the hyaenas and bears of the Caverns," and added that " in Kent's Hole the

( Vltic knives  were found in holes dug by art, and which had disturbed the

floor of the cave and the bones below it " ('Athenaeum,' 14th Aug. 1841, p. 626).

This scepticism, however, did the good service of inducing cavern explorers to con-

duct their researches with an accuracy which should place their results, whatever

they might prove to be, amongst the undoubted additions to human knowledge.

The principal Caverns in South Devon occur in the limestone districts of Ply-

mouth, Yealmpton, Brixham, Torquay, Buckfastleigh, and Chudleigh ; but as those

in the last two localities have yielded nothing of importance to the Anthropologist

or the Palaeontologist, they will not be further noticed on this occasion. In dealing

with the others it seems most simple to follow mainly the order of chronology

that is to say, to commence with the Cavern which first caught scientific attention,

myand, having finished all that the time at  disposal will allow me to say about it,

but not before, to proceed to the next, in the order thus defined ; and so on through

the series.

  --Oreston Caverns. When Mr. Whidbey engaged to superintend the construction

of the Plymouth Breakwater, Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society,
requested him to examine narrowly any caverns he might meet with in the lime-
stone-rock to be quarried at Oreston, near the mouth of the river Plym, not

more than two miles from the room in which we are assembled, and have the bones

or any other fossil remains that were met with carefully preserved (see Phil. Trans.
1817, pp. 176-182). This request was cheerfully complied with, and Mr. Whidbey
had the pleasure of discovering bone-caves in November 1816, November 1820, Au-
gust and November 1822, and of sending the remains found in them to the Royal

Society.

   It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that, though Cavern-researches received a great

impulse from the discoveries in Kirkdale, Yorkshire, and especially from Dr. Buck-

land's well-known and graphic descriptions of them, such researches had originated

many years before. The request by Sir Joseph Banks was made at least as early as

1812 (see Trans. Devon. Assoc. v. pp. 252, 253), and a paper on the Oreston discoveries
was read to the Royal Society in February 1817, whereas the Kirkdale Cavern was
--56 report 1877.

not discovered until 1821. British Cave-hunting appears to Lave been a science of

Devonshire birth.

   The Oreston Caverns soon attracted a considerable number of able observers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

they were visited in 1822 by Dr. Bucldand and Mr. Warburton ; and in a compa-

ratively short time became the theme of a somewhat voluminous literature. No-

thing of importance, however, seems to have been met with from 1822 until 1858,
when another cavern, containing a large number of bones, was broken into. Un-

fortunately, there was no one at hand to superintend the exhumation of the speci-

mens ; the work was left entirely to the common workmen, and was badly done
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

many of the remains were dispersed beyond recovery ; the matrix in whi'ch they

were buried was never adequately examined ; and we are utterly ignorant, and

must for ever remain so, as to whether they did or did not contain indications of
human existence. I visited the spot from time to time, and bought up everything
to be met with ; but other scientific work in another part of the county occupied

me too closely to allow more than an occasional visit. The greater part of the

specimens I secured were lodged in the British Museum, where they seem to have

mybeen forgotten, whilst a few remain iu  private collection.

   Some difference of opinion has existed respecting the character of the successive
caverns, and much mystery has been imported into the question of the introduction

of their contents. Mr. Whidbey, it is said, " saw no possibility of the cavern of 181G
having had any external communication through the rock in which it was enclosed "

(Phil. Trans. 1817, pp. 176-182); but Dr. Buckfand was of opinion that they were all
at first fissures open at the top, and " that the openings had been long filled up with

rubbish, mud, stalactite, or fragments of rock cemented, as sometimes happens, into

a breccia as solid as the original rock, and overgrown with grass " (Phil. Trans.

1822, pp. 171-240).

  The conclusion I arrived at, after studying so much of the roof of the cavern of

1858 as remained intact, was that Dr. Bucldand 's opinion was fully borne out by

the facts ; that, in short, the Oreston caverns were Fissure Caverns, not Tunnel

Caverns.

   The Cavern of 1858 was an almost vertical fissure, extending a length of about 90

feet from N.N.E. to S.S. W. It commenced at about 8 feet below the surface of the

plateau, continued thence to the base of the cliff, but how much further was not

known, and its ascertained height was about 52 feet. It was 2 feet wide at top,
whence it gradually widened to 10 feet at bottom. The roof, j udging from that part
which had not been destroyed, was a mass of limestone-breccia, made up of large

angular fragments, cemented with carbonate of lime, and requiring to be blasted as

much as ordinary limestone. The Cavern was completely filled with deposits of

various kinds.

The uppermost 8 feet consisted of loose angular pieces of limestone, none of which

exceeded 10 lb. in weight, mixed with a comparatively small amount of such sand

as is common in dolomitized limestone districts, but without a trace of stalagmite

or fossil of any kind. The 32 feet next below were occupied with similar materials,

with the addition of a considerable quantity of tough, dark, unctuous clay. Between

this mass and the outer wall of the cavern was a nearly vertical plate of stalagmite,

usually about 2 feet thick, and containing, at by no means wide intervals, firmly

cemented masses of breccia identical in composition with the adjacent bed just

mentioned. The bones the cavern yielded were all found within these 32 feet

and were met with equally in the loose and the coherent breccia, as well as in the

Astalagmite.    somewhat considerable number of ellipsoidal balls of clay, from 1*6

to 2'5 inches in greatest diameter, occurred in the clay of this bone-bed, but not

elsewhere. Still lower was a mass of dark, tough, unctuous clay, containing a very

few, small, angular stones, but otherwise perfectly homogeneous, and known to be
12 feet deep, but how much more was undetermined.

fallen into the open fissures and there perished, and that the remains had sub-

sequently been washed thence into the lower vaultings (Reliq. Dil. 2nd ed. 1834,

p. 78), I venture to add that some of the animals may have retired thither to die
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;
a few may have been dragged or                                                                                   pursued  there by beasts  of prey ;    whilst
                                                                                                                                                                  rains,

such as are not quite unknown in Devonshire in the present day, probably washed

in some of the bones of such as died near at hand on the adjacent plateau. Nothing

appears to have been met with suggestive of human visits.

 --Kent's Hole. About a mile due east from Torquay harbour and half a mile north

from Torbay, there is a small wooded limestone hill, the eastern side of which is,
for the uppermost 30 feet, a vertical cliff, having at its base, and 54 feet apart, two

apertures leading into one and the same vast cavity in the interior of the hill, and
known as Kent's Hole or Cavern. These openings are about 200 feet above mean

sea-level, and from them the hill slopes rapidly to the valley at its foot, at a level
of from 60 to 70 feet below.

   There seems to be neither record nor tradition of the discovery of the Cavern.

ARichardson, in the 8th edition of ' Tour through the Island of Great Britain,'

published, in 1778, speaks of it as " perhaps the greatest natural curiosity " in the

county                               its name occurs on a                                                   map  dated 1769 ;  it  is  mentioned  in    a  lease  dated
                                  ;

1059                    visitors cut their names and dates on the stalagmite from                                                                 1571 down       to the

present century; judging from numerous objects found on the floor, it was visited
by man through mediaeval back to pre-Roman times ; and, unless the facts exhumed

by explorers have been misinterpreted, it was a human home during the era of the
Mammoth and his contemporaries.

   In 1824, Mr. Nortkmore of Cleve, near Exeter, was led to make a few diggings in

the Cavern, and was the first to find fossil bones there. He was soon followed by
Mr. (now Sir) W. C. Trevelyan, who not only found bones, but had a plate of them
engraved. In 1825, the Rev. J. MacEnery, an Irish Roman Catholic priest residing

in the family of Mr. Gary, of Tor Abbey, Torquay, first visited the Cavern, when
he, too, found teeth and bones, of which he published a plate. Soon after, he made
another visit, accompanied by Dr. Buckland, when he had the good fortune to dis-

cover a flint implement--the first instance, he tells us, of such a relic being noticed
iu any cavern (see Trans. Devon. Assoc, iii. p. 441). Before the close of 1825,
he commenced a series of more or less systematic diggings, and continued them
until, and perhaps after, the summer of 1829 (ibid. p. 205). Preparations appear
to have been made to publish the results of his labours ; a prospectus was issued,
numerous plates were lithographed, it was generally believed that the MS. was
almost ready, and the only thing needed was a list of subscribers sufficient to justify

publication, when, alas ! on 18th February, 1841, before the printer had received
any " copy," before even the world of Science had accepted his anthropological

discoveries, before the value of his labours was known to more than a verv few,
Mr. MacEnery died at Torquay.

After his decease his MS. could not be discovered, and its loss was didy deplored.

Nevertheless, it was found after several years, and, having undergone varieties of

fortune, became the property of Mr. Vivian, of Torquay, who, having published

portions of it in 1859, presented it in 1807 to the Torquay Natural-History Society,

whose property it still remains. In 1869, I had the pleasure of printing the whole,

in the 'Transactions of the Devonshire Association.'

Whilst Mr. MacEnery was conducting his researches, a few independent diggings,

on a less extensive scale, were undertaken by other gentlemen. The principal of
these was Mr. Godwin-Austen, the well known geologist, whose papers fully bore
out all that MacEnery had stated. (See Trans. Geol. Soc. Loud. 2nd series, vi.

took the careful exploration of very small parts of the Cavern, and their Report

--was entirely confirmatory of the statements of their predecessors that undoubted

flint implements did occur, mixed with the remains of extinct mammals, in the
cave-earth, beneath a thick floor of stalagmite. The sceptical position of the
authorities in geological science remained unaffected, however, until 1858, when the
discovery and systematic exploration of a comparatively small virgin cavern on
Windmill Hill, at Brixham, led to a sudden and complete revolution ; for it was
seen that whatever were the facts elsewhere, there had undoubtedly been found at

Brixham flint implements commingled with remains of the Mammoth and his
companions, and in such a way as to render it impossible to doubt that Man occu-

pied Devonshire before the extinction of the cave mammals.
   Under the feeling that the statements made by MacEnery and his followers

respecting Kent's Hole were perhaps, after all, to be accepted as verities, the British
Association, in 18G4, appointed a Committee to make a complete, systematic, and

accurate exploration of the Cavern, in which it was known that very extensive
portions remained entirely intact. This Committee commenced its labours on

28th March, 1865 ; it has been reappointed, year after year, with sufficient grants
of money, up to the present time ; the work has gone on continuously throughout
the entire thirteen years ; and the result has been, not only a complete confirmation
of Mr. MacEnery's statements, but the discovery of far older deposits than he sus-

--pected deposits implying great changes of, at least, local geographical conditions ;

changes in the fauna of the district ; and yielding evidence of men more ancient and
for ruder than even those who made the oldest flint tools found in Kent's Hole

prior to the appointment of the Committee.

   The Cavern consists of a series of chambers and passages, which resolve them-
selves into two maiaDivisions, extending from nearly north to south in parallel lines,
but passing into each other near their extremities, and throwing off branches, occa-

sionally of considerable size.

   The successive deposits, in descending order, were :
   1st, or uppermost. Fragments and blocks of limestone from an ounce to upwards
of 100 tous weight each, which had fallen from the roof from time to time, and
were in some instances cemented with carbonate of lime.

   2nd. Beneath and between these blocks lay a dark-coloured mud or mould, con-

sisting largely of decayed leaves and other vegetable matter. It was from 3 to 12
inches thick, and known as the Black Mould. This occupied the entire Eastern
Division, with the exception of a small chamber in its south-western end only, but
was not found in the other, the remoter, parts of the Cavern.

   3rd. Under this was a Stalagmitic Floor, commonly of granular texture and fre-
quently laminated, from less than an inch to fully 5 feet in thickness, and termed

the Granular Stalagmite.

   4th. An almost black layer, about i inches thick, composed mainly of small frag-

ments of charred wood, and distinguished as the Black Band, occupied an area of
about 100 square feet, immediately under the Granular Stalagmite, and, at the
nearest point, not more than 32 feet from one of the entrances to the Cavern. No-

thing of the kind has occurred elsewhere.

   5th. Immediately under the Granular Stalagmite and the Black Band lay a light

red clay, containing usually about 50 per cent, of small angular fragments of lime-
stone, and somowhat numerous blocks of the same rock as large as those lying on

the Black Mould. In this deposit, known as the Care-earth, many of the stones
and bones were, at all depths, invested with thin stalagmitic films. The Cave-earth
was of unknown depth near the entrances, where its base had never been reached

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but in the remoter parts of the Cavern it did not usually exceed a foot, and in afew
localities it "thinned out " entirely.

   6th. Beneath the Cave-earth there was usually found a Floor of Stalagmite

having a crystalline texture, and termed on that account the Crystalline Stalagmite.
It was commonly thicker than the Granular Floor, and in one instance but little

short of 12 feet.

   7th. Below the whole occurred, so far as is at present known, the oldest of the
Cavern deposits. It was composed of subangular and rounded pieces of dark red
grit, embedded in a sandy paste of the same colour. Small angular fragments of
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  59

limestone, and investing films of stalagmite, both prevalent in the Cave-earth, were
extremely rare. Large blocks of limestone were occasionally met with : and the
deposit, to which the name of Breccia was given, w«B of a depth exceeding that to

which the exploration has yet been earned.
    Except in a very few small branches, the bottom of the Cavern has nowhere been

reached. In the cases in which there was no Cave-earth, the Granular Stalagmite
rested immediately on the Crystalline ; and where the Crystalline Stalagmite was
not present, the Cave-earth and Breccia, were in direct contact. Large isolated
masses of the Crystalline Stalagmite, as well as concreted lumps of the Breccia, were
occasionally met with in the Cave-earth, thus showing that the older deposits had,

in portions of the Cavern, been partially broken up, dislodged, and redeposited. No

instance was met with of the incorporation in a lower bed of fragments derived
from an upper one. In short, wherever all the deposits were found in one and
the same vertical section, the order of superposition was clear and invariable
and elsewhero the succession, though defective, was never transgressed.

    Excepting the overlying blocks of limestone, of course, all the deposits contained
remains of animals, which, however, were not abundant in the Stalagmites.

   The Black Mould, the uppermost bed, yielded teeth and bones of Man, Bog, Fox,
Badger, Browu Bear, Bos lonyifrons, Roedeer, Sheep, Goat, Pig, Hare, Babbit, and

--Seal species still existing, and almost all of them in Bevonshire. This has been

called the Ovine bed, the remains of Sheep being restricted to it. In it were also
found numerous flint flakes and " strike-lights ; " stone spindle whorls ; fragments
of curvilineal pieces of slate ; amber beads ; bone tools, including awls, chisels, and
combs ; bronze articles, such as rings, a fibula, a spoon, a spear-head, a socketed
celt, and a pin pieces of smelted copper ; and a great number and variety of

                                                                             ;

potsherds, including fragments of Saurian ware.

    The Granular Stalagmite, Black Band, and Cave-earth, taken together as be-
longing to one and the same biological period, may be termed the Hyanine beds,
the Cave Hyaena being their most prevalent species and found in them alone.
 So far as they have been identified, the remains belong to the Cave Hyaena,
Eguus caballm, Rhinoceros tichorkinus, Gigantic Irish Beer, Bos primipettiui, Bison
prisons, Bed Beer, Mammoth, Badger, Cave Bear, Grizzly Bear, Brown Bear,

--Cave Lion, Wolf, Fox, Reindeer, Beaver, Glutton, Machairodus lutidens, and

Man the last being a part of a jaw with teeth, in the Granular Stalagmite. In
the same beds were found unpolished ovate and lanceolate implements made from

Jtakcs, not nodules, of flint and chert ; flint flakes, chips, and " cores ; " " whet-
stones;" a "hammer-stone;" "dead" shells of Pecten; bits of charcoal ; and

bone tools, including a needle or bodkin having a well-formed eye, a pin, an awl,
 three harpoons, and a perforated tooth of Badger. The artificial objects, of both
bone and stone, were found at all depths in each of the Hyremne beds, but were

 much more numerous below the Stalagmite than in it.

    The relics found in the Crystalline Stalagmite and the Breccia, in some places

 extremely abundant, were almost exclusively those of Bear, the only exceptions
 being a very few remains of Cave Lion and Fox. Hence these have been termed
 the Ursine beds. It will be remembered that teeth and bones of Bear were also

 met with in both the Hysenine and the Ovine beds and it should be understood
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 that this biological classification is intended to apply to Kent's Cavern only. The

 Ursine deposits, or rather the Breccia, the lowest of them, also yielded evidences of

 human existence ; but they were exclusively tools made from nodules, notJlakes, of

flint and chert.

  --Anstys-Cove Cavern. About 3 furlongs from Kent's Hole towards N.N.E., near

 the top of the lofty cliff forming the northern boundary of the beautiful Ansty'a

 Cove, Torquay, there is a cavern where, simultaneously with those in Kent's

 Cavern, Mr. MacEnery conducted some researches, of which he has left a brief

 account (see Trans. Bevon. Assoc, vi. pp. (31-69). I have visited it several times,
 but it seems to be frequently kept under lock and key, as a tool and powder house,

 by the workmen in a neighbouring quarry. It is a simple gallery, and, according
 to Mr. MacEnery, 63 feet long, from 3 to 9 feet high, and from 3 to 6 feet

 broad. Beneath some angular stones he found a stalagmitic floor 14 inches thick,
--60 REPOKT 1877.

and in the deposit below remains of Deer, Horse, Bear, Fox, Hyama (?), Copro-

lites, a few marine and land shells, one white flint tool with fragments of others,

a Roman coin, and potsherds.

In a letter to Sir W. C. Trevelyan, dated 16th December, 1825, Dr. Buckland

states that Mr. MacEnery had found in this Cave " bones of all sorts of beasts, and

also flint knives and Roman coins                                                                                                                                                             in short,  an  open-mouthed                                                               cave,  which   has

been inhabited by animals of all kinds, quadruped and biped, in all successive gene-

rations, and who have all left their exuvias one upon another " (ibid. p. 69).

  --Yealm-Bridr/e Cavern. About the year 1832 the workmen broke into a bone-

cavern in Yealm-Bridge quarry, about one mile from the village of Yealmpton,
and eight miles E.S.E. from Plymouth ; and through their operations it was so

nearly destroyed that but a small arm of it remained in 1835, when it was visited
by Mr. J. C. Bellamy, who at once wrote an account of it, from which it appears

that, so far as he could learn, the Cavern was about 30 feet below the original

limestoue surface, and was filled to within from 1 foot to 6 feet of the roof (see

Nat. Hist. S. Devon, 1839, pp. 86-105). In the same year, but subsequently, it

wasexamined by Captain (afterwards Colonel) Mudge, who states that there were

originally three openings into the Cave, each about 12 feet above the river Yealm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

that the deposits were, in descending order :

             1. Loam with bones and stones                                                                                                                                                                              3*5 feet.

             2. Stiff whitish clay                                                                                                                                                                                     2-5 ,,

             3. Sand                                                                                                                                                                                                60 ,,
             4. Red clay                                                                                                                                                                                            35 ,,

             5. Argillaceous sand                                                                                                                                                                            6 to 18-0 ,,

and that, where they did not reach the roof, the deposits were covered with

stalagmite.

On the authority of Mr. Clift and Professor Owen, Capt. Mudge mentions relics

of Elephant, Rhinoceros, Horse, Ox, Sheep, Hyama, Dog, Wolf, Fox, Bear, Hare,

and Water-Vole. The bones, and especially the teeth, of the Hyasna exceeded in
number those of all the other animals, though remains of Horse and Ox were very

abundant. Mr. Bellamy, whilst also mentioning all the foregoing forms, with the

exception of Dog only, adds, Deer, Pig, Glutton, Weasel, and Mouse. He also

speaks of the abundance of bones and teeth of Hyasna, but seems to regard the Fox

as being almost as fully represented ; and next in order he places Horse, Deer, Sheep,

and  Rabbit or Hare                                                              whilst the relics                                                                                            of  Elephant,  Wolf, Bear, Pig, and Glutton

are spoken of as very rare. The bones, he says, were found in the uppermost bed
only. They were frequently mere fragments and splinters, some beiug undoubtedly

Kehquise of Carnivorous animals greatly exceeded those of the Herbivora, and teeth

were very abundant. Coprolites occurred at some depth below the stalagmite, in

the upper bed, which also contained granitic and trappean pebbles, and lumps of

breccia made up of fragments of rock, bones, pebbles, and stalagmite. The bones

found prior to 1835 had been removed as rubbish, and some good specimens were

recovered from materials emploved in making a pathwav. Nothing indicating the
presence of man appears to have been found.

   The Ash-Hole.--On the southern shore of Torbay, midway between the town of
Brixham and Berry Head, and about half a mile from each, there is a cavern known

as the Ash-Hole. It was partially explored, probably about, or soon after, the time

Mr. MacEnery was engaged in Kent's Hole, by the late Rev. H. F. Lvte, who,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       _s

             1841, Mr. George Bartlett, a native of Brixham, who assisted Mr.
£yte, described to this Section the objects of interest the Ash-Hole had yielded (see
Report Brit. Assoc. 1841, Trans. Sections, p. 61). So far as was then known the

Cave was 30 yards long and G yards broad. Below a recent accumulation, 4 feet

deep, of loam aud earth, with laud and marine shells, bones of the domestic fowl

and of Man, pottery, and various implements, lay a true Cave-earth, abounding in

the remains of Elephant. Professor Owen, who identified, from this lower bed,

relics of Badger, Polecat, Stoat, Water-Vole, Rabbit, and Reindeer, remarks, that

for the first good evideuce of the Reindeer in this island ho had been indebted to

Mr. Bartlett, who stated that the remains were found in this Cavern (see Brit.

Foss. Mam. 184G, pp. 109-110, 113-114, 116, 204, 212, 479-480). I have made

numerous visits to the spot, which, when Mr. Lyte began his diggings, must have

Abeen a shaft-like fissure, accessible from the top only.  lateral opening, however,

has been quarried into it ; there is a narrow tunnel extending westward, in which

the deposit is covered with a thick sheet of stalagmite, and where one is tempted

to believe that a few weeks labour might be well invested.

 --Brixham Cavern. Early in 1858 an unsuspected Cavern was broken into by

quarrymen at the north-western angle of Windmill Hill at Brixham, at a point

75 feet above the surface of the street almost vertically below, and 100 feet above

mean tide. On being found to contain bones, a lease in it was secured for the
Geological Society of Loudon, who appointed a Committee of their members to

imdertake its exploration ; funds were voted by the Royal Society, and supple-
mented by private subscriptions ; the conduct of the investigation was intrusted to

Mr. Prestwich and myself ; and the work, under my superintendence, as the only

resident member of "the Committee, was begun in July 1858 and completed at
midsummer 1859.

   The Cavern, comprised within a space of 135 feet from north to south, and 100
from east to west, consisted of a series of tunnel galleries from 6 to 8 feet in
greatest width, aud 10 to 14 feet in height, with two small Chambers and five

external entrances.

   The deposits, in descending order, were :

  A1st, or uppermost. Floor of Stalagmite, from a few inches to a foot thick, and

continuous over very considerable areas, but not throughout the entire Cavern.

  A2nd. mass of small angular fragments of limestone, cemented into a firm con-

crete with carbonate of lime, commenced at the principal entrance, which it com-
pletely filled, and whence it extended 34 feet only. It was termed the First Bed.

  A3rd. layer of blackish matter, about 12 feet long, and nowhere more than a

foot thick, occurred immediately beneath the First Bed, and was designated the

Second Bed.

  A4th. red, tenacious, clayey loam, containing a large number of angular and

subangular fragments of limestone, varying from very small bits to blocks a ton in
weight, made up the Third Bed. Pebbles of trap, quartz, and limestone were some-
what prevalent, whilst nodules of brown hematite of iron and blocks of stalagmite
were occasionally met with in it. The usual depth of the bed was from 2 to 4 feet,
but this was exceeded by 4 or 5 feet in two localities.

   5th. The Third Bed lay immediately on an accumulation of pebbles of quartz,
greenstoue, grit, and limestone, mixed with small fragments of shale. The depth
of this, known as the Fourth or Gravel Bed, was undetermined; for, excepting a

few feet only, the limestone bottom was nowhere reached. There is abundant
evidence that this bed, as well as a stalagmitic floor which had covered it, had been

partially broken up and dislodged before the introduction of the Third Bed.

   Organic remains were found in the Stalagmitic Floor aud in each of the beds

beneath it, with the exception of the Second only ; but as 95 per cent, of the whole
series occurred iu the Third, this was not unfrequently termed the Bone Bed.

   The Mammals represented in the Stalagmite were Bear, Reindeer, Rhinoceros
/ iehorhinus, Mammoth, and Cave Lion.

   The First Bed yielded Bear and Fox only.
   In the Third Bed were found relics of. Mammoth, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Horse,
Bos primigenius, B. longifrons, Red Deer, Reindeer, Roebuck, Cave Lion, Cave
Ilyama, Cave Bear, Grizzly Bear, Brown Bear, Fox, Hare, Rabbit, Lagomys

spelaus, Water-Vole, Shrew, Polecat, and Weasel.
62 report--1877.

The only remains met with in the Fourth Bed were those of Bear, Horse, Ox,

and Mammoth.

The Human Industrial Remains exhumed in the Cavern were flint implements

and a hammer-stone, and occurred in the Third and Fourth Beds only. The pieces

of fliut met with were 36 in nurnher. Of these, 15 are held to show evidence of

having been artificially worked, in 9 the workmanship is rude or doubtful, 4 have

been mislaid, and the remainder are believed not to have been worked at all (see

Phil. Trans, vol. 163, 1873, pp. 561, 562). Of the undoubted tools, 11 were found

in the Third and 4 in the Fourth Bed. Two of those yielded by the Third Bed,

found 40 feet apart, in two distinct but adjacent galleries, and one a month before

the other, proved to be parts of one and the same nodule-tool ; and I have little or no

doubt that it had been washed out of the Fourth Bed and redeposited in the Third.

The Hammer-Stone was a quartzite pebble, found in the upper portion of the

Fourth Bed, and bore distinct marks of the use to which it was applied.

 --Speaking of the discovery of the tools just mentioned, Mr. Prestwich said in

1859 : " It was not until I had myself witnessed the conditions under which flint

implements had been found at Brixham, that I became fully impressed with the

validity of the doubts thrown upon the previously prevailing opinions with respect

-- Ato such remains in caves " (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 280) ; and according to Sir 0.

Lyell, writing in 1803 : " sudden change of opinion was brought about in

England respecting the probable coexistence, at a former period, of man and many

extinct mammalia, in consequence of the results obtained from the careful explo-

ration of a Cave at Brixham      The new views very generally adopted bjr English

geologists had no small influence on the subsequent progress of opinion in France "

(Antiquity of Man, pp. 96, 97).

 --Bench Cavern. Early in 1861 information was brought me that an ossiferous

cave had just been discovered at Brixham, and, on visiting the spot, I found that,
of the limestone quarries worked from time to time in the northern slope of Furze-

ham Hill, one known as Bench Quarry, about half a mile due north of" Wiudmill-

Hill Cavern, and almost overhanging Torbay, had been abandoned in 1839, and
that work had been recently resumed in it. It appeared that in 1839 the workmen
had laid bare the greater part of a vertical dyke, composed of red clayey loam and

angular pieces of limestone, forming a coherent wall-like mass, 27 feet high, 12 feet
long, 2 feet in greatest thickness, and at its base 123 feet above sea-level. In the

face of it lay several fine relics of the ordinary Cave Mammals, including an entire
left lower jaw of Hyecna spelcea replete with teeth, but which had nevertheless
failed to arrest the attention of the incurious workmen who exposed it, or of any

one else.

   Soon after the resumption of the work in 1861, the remnant of the outer wall of
the fissure was removed, and caused the fall of an incoherent part of the dyke, which
it had previously supported. Amongst the debris the workmen collected some
hundreds of specimens of skulls, jaws, teeth, vertebrae, portions of antlers, and
bones, but no indications of Man. Mr. Wolston, the proprietor, sent some of the
choicest specimens to the British Museum, and submitted the remainder to Mr.

Ayshford Sanford, F.G.S., from whom I learn that the principal portion of them

are relics of the Cave Ilyrena, from the unborn whelp to very aged animals. With
them, however, were remains of Bear, Reindeer, Ox, Hare, Anicola ratticeps, A.

ar/restis, Wolf, Fox, and part of a single maxillary with teeth not distinguishable

from those of Cants isatis. To this list I may add Rhinoceros, of which Mr. Wolston
showed me at least one bone.

   From the foregoing undesirably, but unavoidably, brief descriptions, it will be

--seen that the Devonshire Caverns, to which attention has been now directed, belong

to two classes, those of Oreston, the Ash-Hole, and Bench being Fissure Cares
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

whilst those of Yealm Bridge, Windmill Hill at Brixham, Kent's Hole, and Ansty's
Cove are Tunnel Caves.

   Windmill-Hill and Kent's Hole Caverns have alone been satisfactorily explored

and besides them none have yielded evidence of the contemporaneity of Man with

the extinct Cave Mammals.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  0,3

   Ofeston is distinguished as the only known British Cavern which has yielded

remains of Rhinoceros leptorhmw (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. xxvi. p. 45C).

   Yealm-Bridge Cavern, if we mav accept Mr. Bellamy's identification in 1885,
was the first in this country in which relics of Glutton were found (South Devon
Monthly Museum, vi. pp. 218-223 ; see also Nat. Hist. 8. Devon, 1839, p. 89). The
same species was found in the Caves of Somerset and Glamorgan in 1865 (Pleist.
Mam., Pal. Soc. pp. xxi, xxii), in Kent's Hole in 1869 (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1869,

p. 207), and near Plas Heaton, in North Wales, in 1870 (Quart. Journ. Geol.

Soc. xxvii. p. 407).

   Kent's Hole is the only known British Cave which has afforded remains of
Beaver (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1869, p 208), and, up to the present year, the only
one in which the remains of Machairodus latidens had been met with. Indeed,

Mr. MacEnery's statement, that he found in 1826 five canines and one incisor of

this species in the famous Torquay Cavern, was held by many palaeontologists

to be so very remarkable as, at least, to approach the incredible, until the Com-
mittee now engaged in the exploration exhumed, in 1872, an incisor of the same
species, and thereby confirmed the announcement made by their distinguished

f>redecessor nearly half a century before (Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1872, p. 46). In April

 ast (1877) the Rev. J. M. Mello was able to inform the Geological Society of
London that Derbyshire had shared with Devon the honour of having been a home
of Machairodus latidens. he having found its canine tooth in Robin-Hood Cave in
that county, and that there, as in Kent's Hole, it was commingled with remains of
the Cave Hyasna and bis contemporaries (Abs. Proc. Geol. Soc. No. 334, pp. 3, 4).

   The Ash Hole, as we have already seen, afforded the first good evidence of a

British Reindeer.

    In loolcing at the published Reports on the two famous Torbay Caverns it -will

 be found that they have certain points of resemblance as well as some of dissi-

 milarity :

    1st. The lowest known bed in each is composed of materials which, whilst they
 differ in the two cases, agree in being such as may have been furnished by the dis-

 tricts adjacent to the Cavern-hills respectively, but not by the hills themselves,
 and must have been deposited prior to the existing local geographical conditions.
 In each, this bed contained flint implements and relics of Bear, but in neither of

 them those of Hyaana. In short, the Fourth Bed of "Windmill-Hill Cavern, Brix-
 ham, and the Breccia of Kent's Hole, Torquay, are coeval, and belong to what I

 have called the Ursine period of the latter.

    2nd. The beds just mentioned were in each Cavern sealed with a sheet of stalag-
mite, which was partially broken up, and considerable portions of the subjacent

 In ds were dislodged before the introduction of the beds next deposited.
    3rd. The Great Bone Bed, both at Brixham and Torquay, consisted of red clayey

loam, with a large percentage of angular fragments of limestone; and contained

Jlake implements of flint and chert, inosculating with remains of Mammoth, the

tichorhine Rhinoceros, and Hyaena. In fine, the Cave-earth of Kent's Hole and the
 Third lied of Brixham Cavern correspond in their materials, in their osseous con-
tents, and in their flint tools. They both belong to what I have named the Ilyccnine
 period of the Torquay Cave.

    But, as already stated, there are points in which the two Caverns differ :
    1st. Whilst Kent's Hole was the home of Man, as well as of the contemporary
Hyaena during the absences of the human occupant, there is no reason to suppose

that either Man or any of the lower animals ever did more than make occasional

visits to Brixham Cave. The latter contained no flint chips, no bone tools, no
utilized /VriV'w-sliells, no bits of charcoal, and no coprolites of Hyaena, all of which

 occurred in the Cave-earth of Kent's Hole.

   2nd. In the Torquay Cave relics of Hyaena were much more abundant in the

 Cave-earth than those of any other species. Taking the teeth alone, of which vast
numbers were found, those of the Hyaena amounted to about 80 per cent, of the
entire series, notwithstanding the fact that, compared with most of the Cave-

mammals, his jaws, when furnished completely, possess but few teeth. At Brix-
64 REPORT--1M77.

ham, on the other hand, his relies of all lands amounted to no more than 8- 5 per
cent, of all the osseous remains, whilst those of the Bear rose to 53 per cent.

   3rd. The entrances of Brixham Cavern were completely filled up and its history
suspended not later than the end of the Palaeolithic era. Nothing occurred within
it from the days when Devonshire was occupied by the Cave and Grizzly Bears,
Reindeer, Rhinoceros, Cave Lion, Mammoth, and Man, whose best tools were un-

polished flints, until the quarryrnau broke into it early in a.d. 1858. Kent's Cavern,

on the contrary, seems to have never been closed, never unvisited by Man, from
the earliest Palaeolithic times to our own, with the possible exception of the Neo-
lithic era, of which it cannot be said to have yielded any certain evidence.

Though my History of Cavern Exploration in Devonshire is now completed, so

myfar as the time at   disposal will allow, and so far as the materials are at present

ripe for the historian, I venture to ask your further indulgence for a few brief

moments whilst passing from the region of Fact to that of Inference.

 --That the Kent s-IIole men of the Hyaenine period to say nothing at present of
--their predecessors of the Breccia belonged to the Pleistocene times of the Biologist,

is seen in the fact that they were contemporary with Mammals peculiar to, and

characteristic of, those times. This contemporaneity proves them to have belonged

to the Paleolithic era of Britain and "Western Europe generally, as defined by the

Archaeologist ; and this is fully confirmed by their unpolished tools of flint and

chert. That they were prior to the deposition of even the oldest part of the Peat

Bogs of Denmark, with their successive layers of Beech, Pedunculated Oak, Sessile

Oak, and Scotch Fir, we learn from the facts that even the lowest zone of the bogs has

yielded no bones of mammals but those of recent species, and no tools but those of

Neolithic type ; whilst even the Granular Stalagmite, the uppermost of the Hyaenine

beds in Kent's Hole, has afforded relics of Mammoth, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Cave

Bear, and Cave Hyaena.

  That the men of the Cave Breccia, or Ursine period, to whom we now turn, were

of still higher antiquity is obvious from the geological position of their industrial

remains. That the two races of Troglodytes were separated by a wide interval of

time we learn from the sheet of Crystalline Stalagmite, sometimes 12 feet thick,

laid down after the deposition of the Breccia had ceased, and before the introduc-

tion of the Cave-earth had begun, as well as from the entire change in the materials

composing the two deposits. But, perhaps, the fact which most emphatically in-

dicates the chronological value of this interval is the difference in the faunas. In

the Cave-earth, as already stated, the remains of the Hyaena greatly exceed in

--number those of any other mammal ; and it may be added that he is also disclosed

by almost every relic of his contemporaries their jaws have, through his agency,

lost  their  condyles  and  lower   borders                                       their  bones  are  fractured after a fashion
                                                                               ;

known by experiment to be his ; and the splinters into which they are broken are

deeply scored with his teeth-marks. His presence is also attested by the abundance

of his droppings in every branch of the Cavern. In short, Kent's Hole was one of

his homes ; he dragged thither, piecemeal, such animals as he found dead near it
and the well-known habits of his representatives of our day have led us to expect

all this from him. "When, however, we turn to the Breccia a very different spec-
Wtacle awaits us.
                       Te meet with no trace whatever of his presence, not a single

relic of his skeleton, not a bone on which he has operated, not a coprolite to mark

as much as a visit. Can it be doubted that had he then occupied our country ho

would have taken up his abode in our Cavern ? Need we hesitate to regard this

entire absence of all traces of so decided a cave-dweller as a proof that he had not

yet made his advent in Britain ? Are we not compelled to believe that Man formed

part of the Devonshire fauna long before the Hyaena did ? Is there any method of

escaping the conclusion that between the era of the Breccia and that of the Cave-

--earth it was possible for the Hyaena to reach Britain ? in other words, that the

last continental state of our country occurred during that interval ? I confess that,

in the present state of the evidence, I see no escape ; and that the conclusion thus

forced on me compels me to believe also that the earliest men of Kent's Hole were

inter(jlacial, if not prec/lacial.

   The foregoing Table will serve to show at one view the co-ordinations and theo-
retical conclusions to which the facts of Kent's Cavern have led me, as stated briefly
in the foregoing remarks. The Table, it will be seen, consists of two Divisions,
separated with double vertical lines. The first, or left hand, Division contains three
columns, and relates exclusively to Kent's Cavern, as is indicated by the words
heading it. The second, or right hand, Division is of a more general character, and
shows the recognized classification of well-known facts throughout Western
Europe. The horizontal lines are intended to convey the idea of more or less well-
defined chronological horizons ; and their occasional continuity through two or
more columns denotes contemporaneity. Thus, to take an example from the two
columns headed "Archaeological " and " Danish-Bog," in the second Division : the
horizontal line passing continuously through both, under the words " Iron " and
" Beech," is intended to suggest that the " Iron Age " of Western Europe and the
" Beech " zone of the Danish Bogs take us back about equally far into antiquity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

whilst the position of the line under the word " Bronze," indicates that the " Bronze
Age " (still of Western Europe) takes us back from the ancient margin of the
Beech era, through the whole of that of the Pedunculated Oak, and about halfway
through the era of the Sessile Oak ; and so on in all other cases.

             On the Succession of the Palceozoic Deposits of South Devon.

                     By Arthur Champernowne, M.A., F.G.S.

   Opinion is still much divided on the vexed question of the older rocks of Devon
and Cornwall. General information on the history of the controversy may be
gained from Prof. Geikie's ' Memoir of Sir Roderick Murchison.'

   The writer (with others) holds that Jukes was right iu his main thesis, viz. that
the Devonian rocks are the general equivalents of the Lower Carboniferous, and not
the Marine equivalents of the Old Red Sandstone ; but that in his great fault theoiy
of North Devon he was mistaken, as Mr. Etheridge has apparent^ demonstrated.

   The South-Devonian area is perhaps more disturbed than any other equal area in
the United Kingdom. Inversions are very numerous ; but it is not always easy to
say what beds are inverted, and what are iu their normal position. To give purely
palseontological reasons appears to be reasoning in a circle, and some sort of rules

are necessaiy.

   If, for example, we are studying a band of rocks inclined in one direction, but
which we suspect is not intercalated between the beds on either side, and we
observe that the outer or bounding planes show a tendency to converge downwards,

--the presumption would be that the mass is an inclined trough if upwards, an in-

clined anticlinal fold. The simpler the fold the less liable we shall be to error.

    In applying these principles the author selects three areas for comparison, viz.,

the Torquay Promontory, the tract south of Brixham and east of the Dart, and the
Plymouth district.

   In the Torquay district a series of Red Sandstones is undeniably subjacent to the
Great Devon limestone. It is believed that the Red Sandstones of the other areas
fall into the same horizon, and that together they represent the Old Red Sandstone,
the base of which is scarcely seen south of the Bristol Channel.

   Professor Phillips's section at Plymouth shows that the southern boundary of the
Plvmouth limestone is steeper by 25° than the northern (the former being 70° and

the latter 45°).

    Blue and grey fossiliferous slates &c. separate the limestone from the violently

contorted Red Sandstones of Staddon Point.
   The convergent dips of the limestone, together with the contortions of the

      ^

Staddon beds, points to the conclusion that the limestone occupies a trough, and
the Staddon beds are an inclined anticlinal, as Jukes also believed.

    Phillips held at that time that the superposition of beds on each side of the
Sound on the Plymouth limestone, "except by some improbable conjecture, could
not be shaken" (' Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames,' p. 79), but he
subsequently modified this opinion.

_ The bright claret-coloured slates at Mutley, north of Plymouth, "draw a fransi-

tioinil character to Old lied Sandstone, but no sandstones are seen, and the further

we cross the beds to the north the less are the axes upraised, and the slates may

have overlapped the Old   lied and rested on   the granite before it was  upheaved    ; but
                          beds which skirt it  were compressed into far   less space  than
when this took place the

they had previously occupied.

If the Staddon beds are above the Plvrnouth limestone they must be overlapped

with  a wide  unconformity  by the  (Julru  Measures of Tavistock  and  Launceston                                                but
                                                                                                                               ;
the Cuhn Measures of North Devon are, on the contrary, perfectly conformable to

the underlying series.

   The Fossihferous beds of Whitesand Bay, in the strike of the Plymouth lime-

stone, are also probably older than that limestone.

   In the Brixham area the limestone of Higher Brixham, extending from a little
west of that town to Sharkhain Point, is doubled under beds to the south older

than itself. This is seen to be the case near the Point, the base of a sharply doubled

inclined trough being well exposed above the sea-level, the contorted Bed Sand-
stones of Southdown Cliff corresponding with an anticlinal.

   The beds are not cut out by a fault along the strike, and it is a mistake to repre-

sent the iron-ore of Sharkhain Point as a lode.

   In the Torquay district, provided that the Cockington Bed Sandstones, like those
of the Lincombe and Warberry Hills, can be shown to be older than the limestones,
these last must be the newest Paheozoic beds of the Promontory; but they are not

seen in their natural relations, the intervening space being marked by New Bed

Bocks.

   The Great Devon limestones, then, are, as Mr. H. B. Woodward has said, the

highest rocks of South Devon, and the belief in a series of slates and Bed Sand-
stones overlying them is a fallacy.

   The beds which do succeed the limestones are the Culm Measures (Upper Car-
boniferous), and, from the field work of Messrs. Woodward and Beid, there is reason
to believe them perfectly conformable.

    In this case the difference between the Devonian and Carboniferons Limestones
would be one of life distribution--a geographical and not a chronological difference.

   Tins would probably have been long ago recognized had the characteristic Ich-
thyolites of the Old Bed occurred in the Staddon beds.

   If any doubt remains as to the position of the Great Devon Limestone, it might be
brought to a practical test by boring through supposed Upper slates.

   In America we are told that Old Bed Sandstone overlies Devonian rocks and
fossils. But can the Great Devon Limestone with certainty be equated with any of

the formations beneath the Catskffl beds ? It is very doubtful, and their Lamelli-
branchiate Fauna is said to present somewhat of an Upper Silurian facies.

   If this be so, thosegeologists may be quite right who look for marine equiva-

lents of the Old Bed, in some parts of the world, bridging over the Siluro-Carboni-

ferailfl interval. At the same time, in not admitting that the Great Devon Lime-

stone is such an equivalent, future observers would be unfettered in working out

the structure of Devonshire.

          On the Origin and Antiquity of the Mounds of Arkansas, U.S.

                                 By Prof. J. W. Clarke.

   These mounds form a prominent feature of the State. They are present on all
soils capable of cultivation, alike on the small prairies, in the densest forest, and the
tablelands of the Ozark Mountains, but excepting the bottom-lands of Arkansas
and Mississippi rivers. They vary from 3 to 5 feet in altitude, and are from 50 to

140 feet in diameter.

   The author suggests that they were evolved from the simple corn-hillock by a
race who followed the retreating glaciers.

         Note on the Serpentine of Duporth, in St. Austell Bay, Cornwall.

                               By J. H. Collins, F.G.S.

   In this paper the author shows that an intrusive Greenstone rock, extensively
worked for road-stone at St. Mewan, near St. Austell, is, within 3 miles of that
place, converted into a Porphyritic Serpentine, and believes that this change has
been effected by the agency of mineral solutions acting through fissures from
below.

            On the Drift of Plymouth Hoe. By J. H. Collins, F.G.S.

    The author stated that excavations were nearly always going on in the neigh-
bourhood of Plymouth Hoc, and that fresh sections of the so-called liaised beaches
and Glacial deposits were continually being exposed.

   He had lately visited the Hoe, Mount Batten, and Deadman's Bay, in company

with Mr. Whitley, of Truro, and had found gravels, sands, and clays lying in the
hollows of the limestone and filling fissures and caverns. The gravels were some-
times cemented by stalagmite into a conglomerate. The pebbles were composed of
quartz, limestone, tourmaline and schist, greenstone, blue and red grit, hard clay-
slate, schorl rock, granite, elvan, flint, chert, stalagmite, and one pebble of granite,
all of which the author considered had been derived from the rocks of the neigh-
bourhood within a few miles. None of the pebbles were in the least degree ice-
scratched, and there were very few angular fragments of any kind.

    The gravels had yielded bones of Bhinoceros, Elephants, and other animals of

the so-called Mammoth period.

    The author discussed the evidence of local denudation, and arrived at the fol-
lowing conclusions :

    1. The deposits are not raised beaches.
    2. They are not glacial.
    3. They were formed rapidly.
    4. Gravels, fissure deposits, and cave deposits are of the same age.

   5. That they belong to the Mammoth period.

    6. There is no evidence in the immediate neighbourhood to carry back their for-
 mation more than a few thousand years.

 Note on the Correlation of certain Post-Glacial Deposits in West Lancashire,

              By C. E. De Eance, F.G.S., of H.M. Geological Survey.

    The valley of the Pibble, at Preston, is entirely excavated in Glacial drift, con-

         _

 sisting of Boulder-clay, with an included bed of sand and shingle, together reaching

 a thickness of between 150 and 200 feet. At the bottom of the valley is a broad

 alluA'ial plain through which the river swings in a series of S-like curves, denuding
 away the sides of the valley, and forming them into steep cliffs where the convex
 curves of the S touch the margin of the valley, on the slopes of which are left frag-
 ments of old river-terraces, marking the former position of the Ribble before it had
 vertically denuded as low as at present.

    The terraces, as well as the lowest alluvial plain, generally exhibit the following

 sequence of deposits :

                        1. Fine alluvial silt and loam.
                       2. Peaty beds and trunks of trees.
                      3. Large gravel and stones washed out of the drift.

  --Marking: 1. Alluvial deposit from floods.

                          2. Obstruction of drainage.
                         3. Denudation.

    Throughout Western Lancashire an extensive plain occurs often below the sea-
 level, covered with peat often 30 feet in thickness, and descending to a depth of

--some 60 feet beneath high-water mark a depth sufficient, if the district was ele-

 vated to that amount, to connect Cumberland with the Isle of Man, in which, as in

England,1, C'ervtis megaceroa occurs in the grey clays underlying the peat, 'which, in

the main1 inland districts of Lancashire, is replaced by marine sands and shingle

Awith recent shells resting on the Boulder-clay.                                       submerged forest invariably

occurs on the base of the peat, and is well seen on the coast or the mouth of the

River Alt, near Liverpool, on the coast of Wirval, in Cheshire, and at Rossall, near

Fleetwood : at the latter place a horizon of Scotch Fir is found beneath one of Oak
occasionally Beech most occurs both at the base and at higher horizons in the peat,

overlying which at Rossall occurs Tidal Alluvium, in which were discovered a large

number of Roman coins, which gives a pre-Roman date to the growth of the thick

Seat of Lancashire. In Cheshire there is a very similar sequence, and Neolithic
  int implements have been found in the Peat Series, and are preserved in the Liver-

pool Museum.

  When the Lancashire Peat is followed into the valley of the Ribble it is found to

be continuous with the peat horizon found in the alluvium of the lowest alluvial

flat of that river. In other words, the valley of the Ribble at Preston had been

excavated as low as it is at present before the obstruction of drainage, which led

to the destruction of the forests in the plains and the consequent growth of thick

peat, the whole of which denudation took place after the deposition of the newest of
the Lancashire Glacial Deposits, the Upper Boulder-clay. The old river-terraces,

therefore, that fringe the sides of this valley are distinctly of post-Glacial age,

though of far greater antiquity than the lowest plain, which is the partial equiva-

lent to the peat of the plains.

To sum up the total information obtainable in West Lancashire, it would appear

that after the deposition of the Upper Boulder-clay the Ribble gradually cut a

broad valley, a mile in width and 180 feet in depth, out of the Glacial Drift ; at the
same time the sea was denuding the western edge of the drift and wearing back

a lowland plain, on which afterwards grew a forest surrounding the whole of the

N. W. of England, the laud standing higher than at present ; after which the outfall

of the streams became obstructed and the growth of the peat ensued, which was

followed by a subsidence of some 70 feet or more, followed by the denudation of

coast-lines (still going on), the sequence being, commencing at the newest :

                                                                       In the Plains.  In the Ribble VaMey.

   In the valley of the Irwell the work of excavation is also post-Glacial, and series of
old river-terraces occur ; and though no Palaeolithic implements have ever been found
in them, or in any stream north of the Mersey and the Ilumber, the author cannot
resist the conclusion, looking to the work of excavation done, that these terraces
are of the same geological age as those further south.

            On the Devonian System in England and in Belgium.

                       By Gr. Dewalque, For. Corr. G.S.

Having surveyed, last year, the Devonian system of this country, I avail myself

of the Meeting of the British Association to offer a few remarks on the results of

my survey. As my visit was short I cannot lay claim to a minute aquaintance with

this great  formation  in  England                                     but  as I am well acquainted with it in Belgium
                                                                    ;

and the Rhenish provinces, I hope the following remarks may prove of some interest

to geologists.

  A. I had not the time to visit South Devon. As regards North Devon my con-

clusions are as follows :
--70 REPORT 1877.

   1. The raetamorpliic character is more prevalent there than in Belgium, especially
in the Middle and the Upper Devonian.

   2. All this series is perfectly continuous from Barnstaple to Lynton. Nowhere is
there a reappearance of such identical rocks as to prove by repetition of the series

the existence of a fault.

   3. The Sandstones of Baggy Point and Marwood (Cucullcea zone) perfectly agree,

both lithologically and palseontologicallv, with certain portions of our " Psarnmites

du Condroz." The Red Sandstones of Pickwell Down correspond to the lower part

of these Psarnmites,

   4. The limestone of Ilfracombe represents, as already stated on palaeontological
evidence, the Stringocephalus limestone (Calcaire de Givet) of Belgium and Germany,

while the lithological appearance of the rock is very distinct.

    Hence it is easy to compare this part of the Devonian series with that of the Con-
tinent. In this respect I differ but little from Mr. Etkeridge.

   5. The Devonian limestones are much more abundant on the Continent than on

--this side of the Channel. I think, moreover, that the same is to be said of the Car-

boniferous formation that is to say, that the Mountain limestone is replaced in North
Devon (at least in part) by the beds of Barnstaple and Pilton. I found in the slates
of Pilton, beds and nodules of siliceous concretions (phthanites'), which represent, I
think, the chert of the Carboniferous limestone, or the so-called phthanites of our
" Calcaire carbonifere.

   B. As to the Old Bed Sandstone, I spent a week in Hereford, but saw very little

 of it. I coidd only examine conveniently the cornstones, of which I had from the
descriptions a very imperfect notion. Such limestones occur identically in Belgium,
with red shales, sandstones, and conglomerates, in the northern trough, or " Bassin
de Namur"*.

    This fact seems to me of the highest value, for it leads me to this paradoxical
conclusion, viz. the Old Bed Sandstone of the United Kingdom is a marine forma-
tion, probably formed in the same ocean as the Devonian. The Old Bed of Belgium,

 with the cornstones exhibited, lies regularly between limestones with Stringocephalus
 Burtiiii and others with Spirifer disjunctus. That is certainly a marine formation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 the same must be the case with the English Old Bed Sandstone.

 some of the most important of them.

                     By C. Le Neve Foster, B.A., D.Sc, F.G.S.

  --The author described the Tin-deposits of the following mines : Balmynheer,

  The Lovell, and South Wendron.
     At Balmynheer there is a mass of stanniferous rock 3G fathoms long, and 30 or 40

  feet thick, dipping N. It is mainly a mixture of quartz, chlorite, gilbertite, iron-
  pyrites, and tinstone.

     * Specimens from England, and others from Belgium, were exhibited. They were all

   recognized as cornstones.
TRANSACTIONS OF TH E SUCTIONS.                               71

   Tim Loral] mine is worked Upon two so-called lodes, which are irregular masses
of tLn-bearing rock, adjoining' certain joints running about N.E. and S.W. The rock
is made up of quartz, gilbertite, mica, zinc-blende, chlorite, iron-pyrites, and tinstone.

   Smith Wendron is remarkable for a pipe of somewhat similar rock.
   The author supposed that the tin-bearing rock is an altered granite, and brought

--forward in support of his argument the facts 1st, that pseudomorphs of quartz and

of gilbertite after orthoclase are found at the Lovell mine ; and 2ndly, that there is

always a gradual passage from the tin-bearing rock into the granite, (See Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxxiv. 1878, Aug.)

              On the Great Flat Lode south of Redruth and Camborne.
                     Bg C. Le Neve Foster, B.A., D.Sc, F.O.S.

   In this paper the author described an important tin-lode which is wrought in

various places for a distance of 3i miles, at Wheal Uny, West Basset, &c.
   In some places it occurs (for instance, at Wheal Uny) at the junction of the clay-

slate ( killas) and granite, but in other mines it lies entirely in granite.

    Its characteristics are

  A1. leader or true fissure vein, generally only a few inches wide, and filled with

clay, fragments of the enclosing rocks, and tin- or copper-ores, dipping 30° to 50° S.,
and striking from 20° to 45° N. of E. (true). "

   2. The lode, from 4 to 15 feet wide, on one or both sides of the leader, consisting
mainly of schorl-rock, containing grains and veins of tin-ore. It yields from 1 to 3

per cent, tin-ore.

  A3. capel, or non-stanniferous or slightly stanniferous schorl-rock, separating the

lode from the killas or granite.
   4. Absence of any wall or plane of separation between the lode and capel, or

between the capel and granite.
   The author said that all the appearances pointed to the fact that the lode and

oapel are merely altered granite. In confirmation of this view, he explained that he
bad found cavities in the lode resembling felspar crystals in shape, and probably left
by its removal ; furthermore the microscopic examination of the capel shows ap-
parent pseudomorphs of quartz after felspar.

   If it is admitted that the mass of the " Great Flat Lode" and its capels are altered
rocks once containing felspar, we are driven to conclude that that rock must once
have been granite, because of the gradual passage of the capel into granite. Sup-
posing this view to be correct, we must adopt a similar explanation in the case of
many of the important tin-lodes in Cornwall.

   The great mines north of Carn-Brea Hill, such as Dolcoath, Cook's Kitchen, some
of the Carn-Brea lodes, South Crofty, and East Pool, all furnish" tinstuff" more or
less similar to the stanniferous rock described above ; and the author ventured the
opinion that half of the tin-ore obtained in Cornwall is now derived from altered

granite. He contended that the typical tin-lode of Cornwall should no longer be

represented as the mere contents of what was once an open fissure, and asserted that
though fissures were necessary, their principal function was, not to serve as recep-
tacles for minerals, but to convey the fluids which changed the granite and deposited
the tin-ore in little minor cracks and pores of the altered rock. The large tin-lodes,

in the author's opinion are merely long tabular stockworks rather than ordinary

mineral veins.

    In the year 1876, 83,452 tons of tinstuff were produced from the Great Flat Lode,
yielding 1846 tons of clean tin-ore (black tin) , or more than \ of the total quantity
of tin-ore obtained from Cornwall. (See Quart. Journ. G. S. vol. xxxiv. 1878, Aug.)

The Post-Tertiary Fossils procured in tlie late Arctic Expedition ; ivith Notes

   on some of the Recent or Living Mollusca from the same Expedition. By
   J. Gwyn Jeffreys, LL.D., F.R.S,

   The fossils were collected by Captain Feilden and Mr. Hart, the Naturalists of tlie
Expedition, and by Lieut. Egerton and Dr. Moss, two of the officers of H.M.S.
' Alert,' in very high latitudes, viz. between 82° and 83° N. long. The furthest point
reached by the Expedition was 83° 20' 26". These fossils were found in mud-
banks or raised sea-beds, at heights ranging from the level of the sea to 400 feet above
it. They consisted of 18 species of Mollusca, 1 of Hydrozoa, 1 of Forarninifera, and 1

of marine plants, being altogether 21 species, all of which now live in the Arctic

Seas. The author gave a list of the species, and showed their distribution in a recent
or living as well as fossil state ; and he added some remarks as to the recent Mollusca
procured in the Expedition, and as to the apparent abundance of marine animals in
the " Palseocrystic Sea " of Sir George Nares.

      On the Occurrence of Pebbles in Carboniferous Shale in Westmoreland.

                               By G. A. Lebour, F.G.S.

   This paper was a note of the occurrence of rounded and subangular pebbles of
quartz or quartzite (which were exhibited) in a bed of Carboniferous shale in Angill,
Westmoreland. The pebbles were all of the same character, and were probably
derived from some of the Lake-District rocks and not from veins. The author
brought the present note forward chiefly to elicit the opinions of members of the
Section as to the probable origin of the stones. The rocks associated with the shale
in question were briefly described.

       Notes on the Age of tlie Cheviot Rods. By G. A. Lebour, F.G.S.

    The great mass of the Cheviots consists essentially of porphyrites passing into
granite and syenite, of ashes, and of doleritic rocks of varied character. Wherever
 Silurian rocks are seen in contact with this mass they are tilted up and disturbed
 by it. Wherever, on the other hand, unfaulted junctions of Carboniferous beds
 (including the so-called Upper Old lied, or Basement beds) with Cheviot Traps arc
 seen, the former rest undisturbed upon tlie latter. Moreover, the basement beds
 are largely composed of fragments of Cheviot porphyrite, &c, and these extend
 upwards into the Tuedian or Calciferous Sandstone Series. Tlie Cheviot rocks as a
 whole, then, are post-Silurian and pre-Carboniferous, probably of Devonian age.

This is well attested if not a very generally known fact. Two sets of rocks, how-

 ever, of minor importance in the mass appear to bear witness to at least one, and
 probably two, later dates in the history of the range. These are, first, certain
 vesicular dolerites which occur chiefly in the southern portion of the English side
 of the Cheviots, and which form bosses among the porphyrites, and appear to be
 quite distinct from the more compact dolerites which seem to pass gradually into
 the latter. The vesicular dolerites are, in fact, intrusive in the porphyrite and in
 the compact dolerites. This fact alone would give no clue to their age. This clue
 is afforded by bosses of this vesicular dolerite piercing through the older Car-
 boniferous rocks immediately to the south of the Cheviot mass near the head of
 the Dedewater, in Northumberland, a mile or two from the Scottish border. Rock
 of this character is seen nowhere else in the district. It seems fair, therefore, to
 assume that the vesicular dolerites are at least of Tuedian age. In this they pro-
 bably agree with a mass of intrusive porphyry which crosses the valley of the
 Tweed near Corham, but which the author has not studied.

The second set of rocks claiming attention are some doloritic breccias which occur

in somewhat obscure and confused patches in Punchestown, Burn, and perhaps

elsewhere, These breccias consist of fragments of porphyritic and Lower Uarboni*

ferous 7-ocks embedded in a matrix of dolerite. They arc therefore at least post-

On the Occurrence of Aviculopecten and other Marine Shells in Dejiosiis
    associated with Seams of Coal containing Salt Water in the Ashby Coal-
  field. By William Moltneux, F.O.S.

   The author described the strata passed through in sinkings for coal at the
Colliery belonging to the Coton Park and Linton Colliery Company (Limited), on the
Leicester branch of the Midland Railway, near Burton-on-Trent, as consisting of
Keuper Sandstones, Bunter Conglomerates, and Permian Marls and Breccias, about
·500 feet in thickness, lying horizontal and unconformable to the succeeding Coal-
measures. The situation of the pit was west of the supposed boundary fault of the
Coal-field, and about half a mile north of Gresley Station. In the shale immediately
overlying the Main Coal were found specimens of Aviculopecten papyraceus, Goniatites
Listeri, Posidonia, sp., Orthoceras, sp., and Lingula mytiloides. The coal in ques-
tion has long been known to contain large quantities of water, yielding, accord-
ing to an analysis by the late Dr. Ure, 3700 grains of chloride of sodium to an
imperial gallon. It is also possessed of bromine and other constituents of sea-
water ; and the Saline Baths at Ashby and Moira are supplied with it, the water
being pumped from the coal in the Moira pits adjoining. The Main Coal had been
worked at its base or outcrop many hundreds of years ; but the occurrence of salt
water in it did not appear to have been noticed till the deep pit of Moira was sunk
in 1832, by the late Mr. Ed. Mammatt, the author of ' Geological Pacts,' in
which work Dr. Ure's analysis is contained ; the discovery and manner in which the
water is found is fully described. With the above exception, and a brief notice of it
by Professors Hull and Green, in the ' Memoirs of the Geological Survey ' (Ashby
Coal-field), the author was unaware of any published reference to the water. Salt
water had also been discovered about two years ago in sinkings for coal through

New Red Sandstone and Permian rocks, at the village of Snarestone, near

Measham, by the Appleby Magna Colliery Company (Limited) ; and in this case it
was found in a bed or shale immediately overlying a seam of coal which, there was
every reason to conclude, occupied the horizon of the Main Coal of the Ashby field,
but which from local causes had here become attenuated and impoverished. In the
shale the author found Lingula mytiloides, but none of the other shells of which the
Coton Park series is composed. The upper part of the seam found here consisted
of brown cannel, the lower portion of bright bituminous coal, in every respect cor-
responding with the character of the Main Coal ; and the division of the seam, about
three inches in thickness, was made up in part of compressed plants and a stony
brown cannel containing several specimens of Palaocarabus Russellianus, Anthracosia,
sp., Beyrichia, sp., and spores of Lepidodvndron. The original discovery of the salt
water was in coal uncovered by any newer rocks than Drifts of the Boulder-clay
series ; but the two sinkings in question, together with an earlier sinking through

similar strata at Netherseal, placed on record the existence of the salt water in coal
where covered over by the naturally on-coming groups of rocks.

   It did not appear to the author that any explanation had been advanced to
account for the presence of the saline water in this isolated position. Most of the
other coal-seams of the field, both above and below the Main Coal, contained water,
but in no other instance was it in the least charged with saline matter. The author
showed that it could not have been derived from the saliferous marls, because
where the Bunter and Permian intervened, the water (of which they contained
enormous quantities) was perfectly fresh ; and had the Red Marls spread over the
--74 REPORT 1877.

upturned edges of the coal-seams been the source of the saline matter the water of

other coal-seams must have been similarly affected. Immediately above the Main
Coal, between it and the shale containing the marine shells, is a bed of impervious
clay called " Tow," and directly below it an equally compact bed of fire-clay ; and
it was the author's opinion that the saline water of the coal was in fact the fossil
or pent-up water of the sea in which those animals lived whose fossil remains had
been found in the shales above, and that it had been preserved to the present day
from evaporation and admixture by the impervious beds of clay, the position and

character of which he had described above. He adduced evidence he had met with

of the total submersion of every seam of coal found in the Ashby coal-field, and

in the other coal-fields of the Midlands, immediately after the completion of the
formation or deposition of each seam ; and from the fossils and other data therewith
associated, the submerging agent was, with few exceptions, fresh water; but
although there were several instances of the alternation of fresh- with salt-water

deposits in the Coal-measures generally, he knew of no other in which there was

so direct and clear an association of salt water with the fossil remains of marine
animals. The history of the Coal-formation of this county was as yet but imper-
fectly understood.

     The Carboniferous Limestone and Millstone Grit in the Country around

              Llangollen, N. Wales. By George H. Morton, F.G.S.

   The author described the Carboniferous Limestone exposed in the Eglwyseg

ridge near Llangollen, N. Wales. He stated that the finest section is exposed at

the Ty-nant ravine on the west of Cefn-y-Fedw, and that the country around must
be considered as the typical area of the Lower Carboniferous series of North Wales.
The Millstone Grit, or Cefn-y-Fedw Sandstone, which reposes on the limestone in
the same district, was also described. The following tabulation explains the suc-
cession and thickness of the entire series :

   These few facts serve to verify the general conclusions arrived at by former
observers, and, when more fully investigated and the fossils identified, will help to
correlate the Carboniferous of North Cornwall with the divisions now established
elsewhere. They serve, at least, to show that there are provinces in our local geology

still holding out temptations of further conquest to the geological explorer.

    On the Exploration of some Caves hi the Limestone Hills in Fermanagh.

                                     By T. Plunketx.

   In the caves were found a large quantity of human and animal remains, together
with rude flint inplements, bone and iron pins, and coarse pottery. Some of

these caves are found at an elevation of over uOO feet above the adjoining valleys,
showing the extraordinary waste of the surface of the country by the denuding
forces of ice and water. Before being explored they were almost filled to the roof
with cave-earth.

   After removing the upper stratum of dark earth in a cave which occurs in the Knock-
ninny hill in the south side of Fermanagh, a large cinerary urn was found placed in
a niche in the side of the cave, inverted on a flag and containing burnt human bones.
It stood 14£ inches high and 15 inches in diameter, and was devoid of any orna-

mentation save a few scratches made across the fine when the clay was soft. On
digging deeper down some angular blocks of stone were turned up which had

evidently fallen from the roof of the cave during its earlier history. Underneath

these blocks charcoal, human remains, bones of the wild boar, red deer, fox,
and short-horned Celtic cow were found. The cave-earth having been removed
five vertical feet below where the urn was found, a floor of stalagmite, highly
crystalline, was met with, underneath which an ancient hearth was found, together
with rude flint implements and broken pottery and portions of human skulls. The
human remains found in this cave were considered to be of very great antiquity.

   Cave No. 2 contained a vast quantity of cave-earth and gravel and penetrated an
escarpment on the side of a limestone hill. Layer after layer of cave-earth was
removed to a depth of 20 feet. Three floors of stalagmite were blasted Tip with

dynamite, and underneath every one of the floors human relics and animal remains
were found. Bone pins of various patterns were found in the lowest stratum of the

cave, and broken animal bones, charcoal, and rude pottery were found interspersed
through the whole of this mass of cave-earth from top to bottom.

   The exploration of several other caves which occur in the same locality was de-
scribed. These have yielded a quantity of flint flakes, rude pottery, and the bones
of the horse, wild boar, wolf, red deer, and remains of various other animals. In
one cavern a human jaw was found embedded in glacial clay and associated with
scratched stones. The entrance to this cave was in a steep limestone acclivity about
250 feet above the adjoining valley. The work is still going on, and Mr, Plunkett

expects to find objects of still greater interest.

      On the Junction of the Limestone and Culm-measures near Chudleigh.
 By Clement Eeid, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England and Wales.

   Although there was little positive evidence of the relations between the Devonian

          _

Limestone of Chudleigh and the Culm-measures, there were indications of con-
formability in the general arrangement of the strata, and in one instance evidence of
                                                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                             77

passage-beds between the two. Mr. Reid pointed out that the Limestone and

underlying Devonian Slates were faulted against the Culm-measures on the west, as

supposed by Jukes                                                                                       and he had been  able  to trace the fault through certain points
                                                                                                     ;

which had previously been held as evidence of unconformability.

On a new Method for Studying the Optical CJiaracters of Minerals.

                        By H. C. Sokby, F.R.S. 4'c.

The author first described the principles on which this method depended, and

showed that the great difference between the appearance seen with the naked eye

and the microscope is due to the object-glass being able to collect divergent rays.

In looking with a two-magnifying power at a small circular hole seen through a

section of a crystal, very different phenomena present themselves, according to its

optical characters. If it has no double refraction, only one well-defined circular

bole can be seen. If the mineral possess double refraction and only one optic axis,

like calcite, two images of the hole are seen. If the section be cut perpendicular to
the_ axis, two circular holes are seen directly superimposed but at two different

foci. If the section be in the plane of cleavage two widely divided images are

visible--the one due to the ordinary ray being circular, and the other, due to the

extraordinary ray, being distorted and drawn out in two opposite planes at two
Whendifferent foci.
                                                                                                        the section is cut parallel to the axis, this image due to the

extraordinary ray is still more elongated, but the images are directly superimposed.

We thus at once learn that the mineral has double refraction, has an optic axis, and

also what is the direction in which the section is cut. In the case of crystals like

aragonite, which have two optic axes, there is no ordinary ray ; and at two focal

points we see tbe circular hole drawn out in opposite planes into crosses. The

character of these crosses depends upon the direction of the section ; but the fact of

the crosses being seen at once proves that the mineral has two optic axes. Some

facts are better observed if, instead of a circular hole, we examine through the

crystalline plate a grating with two systems of lines at right angles to one another.

We then obtain what the author calls unifocal or bifocal images, according to the

systems of crystallization. Crystals without double refraction have only one unifocal

image                            crystals having                                                        one  optic  axis  have  one  unifocal  and  one  bifocal  image
                              ;

whereas crystals having two optic axes give two bifocal images. The definition of

unifocal images is independent of the position of the lines ; whereas in the case of

bifocal images the lines are distinctly visible only when they are parallel or perpen-

dicular to a particular axis of the crystal, and spread out and become obscure and
disappear when rotated to a different azimuth. The above-named general characters

differ so much in different minerals that they furnish a most valuable means for

their identification.

Influence of the Position of Land and Sea upon a Shifting of the Axis of the
                 Earth. By Arthur War. Waters, F.G.S., F.L.S.

   The author pointed out how the unequal distribution of land and sea may be an

agent in preventing the movements of elevation and depression of the land, in one

part of the globe, balancing those in another, and further showed how similar

movements in various localities woidd differently affect the pole.

   Any movement, such as a submarine elevation, which displaced water would

spread it over the oceanic area ; and the effect of this woidd, with the present con-
figuration, be the same as if about -jV of the weight had been added in the southern
hemisphere along 45° 44' long. E., viz. in a line passing by the entrance of the White
Sea over the Caucasus through the middle of Madagascar.

   As every submarine movement woidd create a force acting in this direction, there
seems reasonable grounds for thinking the tendency woidd be for the shifting of the

axis to take place near this fine. Dr. Jules Caret considers that the pole must have
moved approximately in a line passing through 52° long. E., and what is cause/what

effect, and how far they react on one another is fully worthy of examination by any

physical geologist.
78 REPORT--1877.

   The shifting caused by any elevation of land near the equator or poles is very
slight, so that the effect of the water displaced is, up to about the oth degree of
latitude, as great or greater than that caused directly by the movement of the land.

From this it is apparent that near the equator a submarine movement may act on
the pole in a contrary direction to that exercised by a similar movement nearer

^45° lat. As about of the globe is included between the latitudes 5° N. and 5° S.,

the effects of movements here are specially worthy of consideration.
   The effects of the drying up of an ancient Caspian sea was taken as an illustra-

tion of the points brought forward. The loss of water of double the area of the
Caspian, evaporating to a depth of about 200 feet, woidd, by the loss of weight of
water, shift the pole about 106 feet towards the White Sea ; but as this water
would be so distributed as to cause additional weight along 45° 44' long. E. in
the southern hemisphere, it woidd shift the pole still further in the same direction,
making a total of about 170 feet. If there were a Caspian Sea in the south along
this line, then similar phenomena would cause a movement of 156 feet as against
176 feet in the north.

On the Occurrence of Branchipus or Chirocepbalus in a Fossil State in the upper
   part of the Fluvio-marine Series {Middle Eocene) at Gurnet and TJiorness

   Bays, near Cowes, Isle of Wight. By Henry Woodward, F.R.S., of the

    British Museum.

    The author referred to the great interest surrounding the geology of the Isle
of Wight, from the labours of Ibbetson, Forbes, Mantell, Prestwich, BristowT, and
many others, and the rich Fauna contained in its strata, much of which remains to
be described, although its stratigraphical geology has been well worked out by the

officers of the Geological Survey.

   Mr. Woodward called attention to a thin band of freshwater limestone occurring

at the base of the cliff belonging to the Bembridge series, from 2 to 12 inches thick,
which at places is full of remains of plants and insects, Dytiscus, Curculio, Formica,
&C, and, what is most remarkable, the diaphanous bodies of a small Phyllopod
Crustacean without a hard shelly covering. This little Crustacean is closely related
to the " Brine-shrimp " (Artemia salina), so abundant in the brine-pans at Lymington
at the present day. Branchipus or Chirocephalus is a freshwater Crustacean found
living in ponds in Devonshire and Kent. Its preservation is due to the admirable
nature of the fine argillaceo-calcareous rock in which it has been entombed in such
 numbers, the delicate outline of its gill-feet being stained with iron so as to be as
well shown as in a photograph.

 Notes on the Devonian Rocks near Newton Allot and Torquay ; with Remarks

    on the Subject of their Classification. By Horace B. Woodward, F.G.S.,

    of the Geological Survey of England and Wales.

     After having alluded to the imperfect state of the information respecting the
 Devonian rocks, especially in regard to local details of structure, the writer pointed

--out that the succession of strata near Newton Abbot and Torquay was (in descend-

ing order) as follows: 3, Limestone; 2, Slates; and 1, Red Sandstones. He

 noted the resemblances in lithological characters between these beds and the Lower
 Carboniferous rocks and Old lied Sandstone, with which they were classed fifty
 years ago by De la Beche. lie likewise drew attention to their relations with the
 Culm-measures, observing that while there were indications of conformability to

 them, no positive proof to the contrary had been established ; and the supposed
 instances of unconformability were all of them, as Jukes had considered, capable of
 explanation by faidts and other disturbances. Attention was drawn to some striking
 cases of such phenomena. The impossibility of accepting fossil evidence alone was
 insisted upon, inasmuch as its value in classification could only be gained after the
                       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTION'S.                                              ? J(

stratigraphieal relations of the beds had been made out, and at present the exact
horizons from which many of the species bad been collected was not determined.

   Further, the theory that the Devonian rocks were the equivalents in time to the

Old Red Sandstone, required the existence at this period of a great barrier between
t lie marine deposits of the former group and the freshwater accumulations of the
latter, and there was no physical evidence in support of this. Talcing all the facts
into consideration, the author argued that they were in favour of the classifi-
cation proposed by Jukes, which regarded the lowermost Devonian rocks as Old
lied Sandstone, and the slates and limestones as Lower Carboniferous, formed in an
area which constituted a zoological province differing to some extent from that in
which these rocks were deposited further north in the British area.

     Address by J. Gwyn Jeffreys, LL.D., F.R.S., Treus.G.SfL.SS.,

                                        President of the Section.

Being merely an amateur naturalist, and not having had any strictly scientific

education, I consider it a great honour to be invited to preside over this important

Section of the Association. I cannot pretend to give such an Address as may be

expected from the President; but I will offer some remarks on a subject in which

1 take considerable interest and have done some work, viz. the deep-sea Mollusca.

The historical part of the subject has been fully treated by Dr. G. C. Wallich in

his  ' North-Atlantic  Sea-bed/  1862                           by  Professor  Prestwich  in  his  Presidential
                                                             ;

WyAddress to the Geological Society of London in 1871 ; and by Professor Sir                       ville

Thomson in his ' Depths of the Sea,' 1873.

By the term " deep-sea " I do not mean the zone which the late Professor Edward

Forbes called the eighth, and which he supposed to be the lowest and the limit of

habitability, in his elaborate and excellent P»,eport on the yEgean Invertebrata,

published by the Association in 1844. That zone comprised the depths lying

between 105 and 230 fathoms. Nor would I refer to it the " deep-sea " zone which

I defined in the Introduction to my work on 'British Conchologv,' 1802; this

applied to the British seas only, and extended to the " line of soundings," being

about 100 fathoms. Since that time the exploring expeditions in H.M.SS.

' Lightning,' ' Porcupine,' ' Challenger,' and ' Valorous,' as well as in the Norwe-

gian frigate ' Yoringen,' have shown that Mollusca inhabit the greatest depths

that have been examined, and that life is not less abundant and varied in the

abvs3es of the ocean than it is in the shallowest water. Instead of 300 fathoms or

1800 feet, which Forbes assumed to be the extreme boundary of submarine life,

we must now take 3000 fathoms or 18,000 feet, and even much lower depths. It

may be well to distinguish two zones of depth exceeding that which I have termed

"the line of soundings;" and I would propose the name "abyssal" for depths

between 100 and 1000 fathoms, and " benthal " (from the Homeric word (ievOos,

signifying the depths of the sea) for depths of 1000 fathoms and more.

   The first knowledge that I had of the Mollusca from the lowest or "benthal"

zone I owe to Dr. Wallich, who kindly gave me a few small shells which he got
in a sounding of 1G22 fathoms in N. Lat. 55° 36', W. Long. 54° 33', oflf the coast

of Labrador, during his cruise in H.M.S. ' Bulldog ' in 1860. These consisted of

undescribed species of Aclis, Homaloyyra, and Pleurotoma, Pteurotoma tenuicostata
--80 REPORT 1877.

of M. Sar.?, and fragments of Saxicava rugosa, Linne", and of other shells which

are unknown to me. Among these was a dead but perfect specimen of Crenella
fuba, Fabricius, which is a common inhabitant of the laminarian zone in Arctic
seas, and may have been voided by a fish or sea-bird. This would account for the

occasional occurrence at great depths of other shallow-water shells and fragments.
    I had the good fortune to take part in the two ' Porcupine ' expeditions of 1869

and 1870 and in the ' Valorous ' cruise of 1875 ; and the Mollusca of the ' Light-
ning' (1868), < Challenger ' (1873-76), and 'Voringen' (1876) expeditions have

been submitted to my inspection. I am consequently enabled to form some idea

of the bathymetrical distribution of the Mollusca thus obtained, with the aid of

my dredging experience for upwards of forty years.

   Perhaps the best way of communicating this idea to others will be by giving
the subjoined list of the species of deep-sea Mollusca dredged by me in the ' Valorous,'
all of which are found at depths exceeding 1000 fathoms. The range of deptli

there and elsewhere in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean will be noted, as
well as some geological and other observations. Four only of such deep dredgings
were made during the cruise, viz. in 1100, 1750, 1450, and 1785 fathoms. The
first two were in Davis Strait, and the other two between Cape Farewell and

W. Long. 26° on the return voyage.

As far as I have had an opportunity of judging from the Molluscaof the North and
South Atlantic, I am inclined to think that the Arctic and Antarctic currents do

not extend heyond tho Equator. The South-Atlantic species procured by the

' Challenger ' party in deep water appear to he different from those of the North

Atlantic in similar depths, according to our present notion of species. It is unne-

cessary for me to renew my objection to the phrase " representative species," as

Sir Wyville Thomson has satisfactorily disposed of the matter in page 14 of his

' Depths of the Sea.'

It will be seen, on referring to the list of deep-water Mollusca procured in the

f Valorous ' cruise, that several of the species are also Sicilian fossils. They occur

in the Pliocene formation of the south of Italy. Professor Seguenza has just pub-

lished a very complete and valuable catalogue entitled ' Elenco dei Cirripedi e dei

Molluschi della zona superiore dell' antico plioceno,' which are arranged in two

divisions, " Depositi littorali " and " Depositi suhmarini." But some further dis-

tinction would seem to be necessary in order to separate the strata, inasmuch as

certain species which are assuredly littoral are included in the submarine division.

For instance, Adeem piisillus, Forb. (which lives at depths varying from 40 to 1450

fathoms), and Cylichna ovata, J. (G6-8G2 fathoms), are entered in both divisions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

while peculiarly shallow-water species, such as Patella vulgata, Tectum virginea,

and six now also living species of Cluton, appear only in the submarine or deep-
water division. Many of the species in Segnenza's Catalogue (besides those noticed

in the ' Valorous ' list of deep-water Mollusca), which had been previously con-

sidered extinct, were discovered hy me in the ' Porcupine ' expeditions to be still

living ; and I have no doubt that the rest of the so-called extinct species, from the

upper zone of the older Pliocene in Sicily, will sooner or later be detected in future

deep-sea explorations. In fact our examination of the ahyssal fauna has been

hitherto extremely slight and cursory, taking into account the enormous extent of

area, the difficulties caused by unfavourable weather, and the inadequacy of the

instruments used in the investigation. Our good neighbours, the Norwegians,

have not relaxed in their work ; and while this Address is being delivered their

second year's expedition to the Arctic seas will almost have been completed. May

every success attend them !

There has heen lately a good deal of controversy as to the supposed " continuity

of the Chalk ;" and the affirmative of the proposition has been most ably argued by

my colleague and friend, Sir Wyville Thomson, in his ' Depths of the Sea.'

Prof. E. Forbes, in his Report on ^Egean Invertebrata (1844), was, I helieve, the

Hefirst to state the proposition.  says, at p. 178, that the strata in his lowest

region, or 230 fathoms, would, if filled up, " present throughout an uniform mineral

character closely resembling that of chalk, and will be found charged with charac-

teristic organic remains and ahounding in Foraminifera. "We shall, in fact, have

an antitype of the chalk."

Sir Wyville Thomson supports his view by the weighty authority of Dr. Car-

penter, Prof. Huxley, and Prof. Prestwich ; and although the late Sir Charles Eyell

entered a vigorous protest against the hypothesis, and went so far as to designate it

a " popular error," I will refrain from expressing any opinion of my own, but will

content myself with stating a few facts in elucidation of the question.

   The comparison of the deep-sea ooze with the geological formation known as
chalk depends on two points, viz. the mineral composition and the organisms

belonging to each.

 --1. Mineral composition. The late Prof. David Forbes, whose knowledge as a

mineralogist and chemist was universally recognized, furnished me, on my return

from the ' Porcupine ' expedition of 1809, with a complete analysis of a sample of

Atlantic mud procured at a depth of 1443 fathoms. He proved that it differed

from ordinary chalk in containing scarcely more than 50 per cent, of carbonate of

lime, whereas chalk consisted all but entirely of carbonate of lime. Indeed Sir
Wyville Thomson admits that " a more careful investigation shows that there are

--very important differences between them."
   2. Organisms. I must here confine myself chiefly to the Mollusca, which Sir C.
Lyell regarded as " the highest or most specialized organization " on which geolo-

gical reasoning and classification are founded.

   Mielel by the apparent resemblance of Mediterranean and Atlantic ooze to
the ancient chalk, geologists have been accustomed to consider the chalk fauna as

having lived in deep water. Let us see how this is with respect to the Mollusca.
I have lately, with the assistance of Mr. Henry Woodward and Mr. Etheridge,
examined the Cretaceous Mollusca in the British Museum and the Museum of

Economic Geology ; and Mr. Etheridge has most obligingly prepared and furnished

me with a tabular list of the genera and number of species in each genus in the

Upper Cretaceous group (exclusive of the Gault and Greensand), which list I will,
with his permission, here insert :

  A glance at the above list, and, much more, an inspection of the Chalk Mollusca

in a good collection, ought to convince any conchologist that all these genera were
comparatively shallow-water forms. I should infer that the depth might have been
from low-water mark to 40 or 50 fathoms. None of the genera are deep-water.

Charna, Ostrea, Pitma, Calyptrcca, Hippomjx, and, most assuredly, Patella cannot
86 report--1877.

be placed in the latter category ; and the old proverb, " noscitur ex sociis," will

apply to mollusks as well as to men. Teredo may have been littoral or have come
from floating wood. Not a single species of Leda, Pecchiolia (or Verticordid),
Neara, not one of the Solenoconchia nor of the Bulla family occurs in the upper or
white Chalk, although they now inhabit the deep-sea ooze and especially charac-

terize the modern deposit.
   But Nautilus and Spirula are believed by some to be deep-water forms. This

must be a mistake. Although the animal of that common species Nautilus pom-
pilius has rarely been met with, the shells are often found on beaches in the Indian
Ocean and South Pacific; and I am not aware of any instance of a deep-water

mollusk being cast ashore. It is not likely. Buniphius (the "Plinius Indicus "),
in his ' Amboinsche Rariteitkarner,' or Cabinet of the Curiosities of Amboyna,
1705, has given an interesting account of the habits of the Pearly Nautilus, a trans-

lation of which I will copy from the admirable monograph of Professor Owen :

" AVhen the Nautilus floats on the water, he puts out his head and all his tentacles,
and spreads them upon the water, with the poop of the shell above water ; but at the
bottom he creeps in the reverse position, with his boat above him, and with his head

and tentacles upon the ground, making a tolerably quick progress. He keeps himself

chiefly upon the ground, creeping also sometimes into the nets of the fishermen ; but
after a storm, as the weather becomes calm, they are seen in troops, floating on the
water, being driven up by the agitation of the waves. This sailing, however, is
not of long continuance, for having taken in all their tentacles, they upset their
boat, and so return to the bottom."

   As to the Spirula, the old Dutch naturalist remarked that it attaches itself to
the rocks, and is thrown up on the beach when the north wind blows. Peron

found the first living specimen in Australia ; Mr. Percy Earl obtained one on the

coast of New Zealand ; the late Sir Edward Belcher another in the Indian Archi-

pelago ; Mr. Bennett got one off Timor ; and an imperfect specimen was procured

m the ' Challenger ' Expedition. I was favoured, in January 1875, by Mr. J.

Tyerman, of Tregony, sending for my inspection a perfect specimen of Spirula

aus/ralis and one of Aryonauta gondola in spirit of wine, with a memorandum

that " the Spirula and Argonauta were taken by a friend while dredging or, rather,
skimming for Pteropods in the Persian Gulf." Mr. Tyerman added that other live
 specimens of the Spirula were captured at the same time. Sir Lewis Pelly informs

me that the Persian Gulf is nowhere deeper than between 40 and 50 fathoms.

 Spirula has apparently the same habit as species of Loligo and allied genera, in
 occasionally frequenting the surface of the sea. The shells of S. australis are
 thrown up in considerable numbers on every beach in the North Atlantic, having
 been wafted northwards by winds and the equatorial cm-rent or so-called " Gulf
 Stream."

     Assuming, therefore, that the usual habitat of Mollusca in past epochs did not

 differ from that of recent Mollusca of the same kind, I think we may safely con-

 clude that the shells of the Cretaceous system, or, more strictly, the Upper Chalk,
 belonged to shallow and not deep-water Mollusca.

    Mr. Woodward tells me that the Chalk Crustacea are also shallow-water forms.
    The white chalk is in many places principally composed of Globiyerinee, Orbulhuc,

 and coccoliths or coccospheres, all of which inhabit at present the surface of the
 sea. According to Dr. "Wallich, Gldbigerina is found in all latitudes and at all
 depths, ranging from 50 to 3000 fathoms *. Mr. Parker and Prof. Eupert Jones
 (first-rate authorities on the Foraminifera) admit that Orbulina and Globitjerina
 are " occasionally found in shallow water "f.

    I cannot identify a single species of the Cretaceous Mollusca as now living or

 recent. All of them are evidently tropical forms. One of the Cretaceous species,
 indeed, Terebratula striata, Wahlenberg, has been supposed by some palaeon-
 tologists to be identical with T. caput-serpentis, the latter of which has a range of
 bathymetrical distribution from low-water mark to 808 fathoms ; its geographical
 extension is equally great, and it has also not a slight amount of variation in

striata the ribs are much narrower than in the typical T. caput-serpentis and are

finely beaded or tuberous, especially towards the beaks, and they are not so

close together as in the variety septeiitrionalis. This question of identity depends,

however, on the capability of hereditary persistence which some species possess

and although a certain degree of modification may he caused by an alteration of

conditions in the course of incalculable ages, our knowledge is not sufficient to

enable us to do more than vaguely speculate, and surely not to take for granted

lution, or succession, appears to be the law of nature ; evolution (in its modern

ment hy other species. * The notorious imperfection of the geological record ought

                                               cannot conceive the extent of this

imperfection. Not merely are our means of geological information restricted to

those outer layers of the earth which are within our sight, but nearly three fourths

of its surface are inaccessible to us, so long as they are covered by the sea. Were

this not the case, we might have some chance of discovering a few of the missing

links which would connect the former with the existing fauna and flora. It is
impossible even to guess what strata underlie the bottom of the ocean, or when the_
latter attained its present position relatively to that of the laud. The materials of

the sea-bed have been used over and over again in the formation of the earth's

crust ; " Omnia mutantur, nihil interit ; " * and the future history of our globe

will, to the end of time, repeat the past. What does Shakespeare say, as a geolo-

gist, to such cosmical changes ?

  Make mountains level, and the continent

   There is also the difficult problem of submarine light, evidenced by the facts
of deep-sea animals having conspicuous and well-formed eyes, and of the shells

of deep-sea Mollusca being sometimes coloured, which is yet unsolved.

   Much more remains to be done ; and probably many generations, nay, centuries,
must elapse before the very interesting subject which I have now ventured to sub-

mit to your consideration will be mastered or thoroughly understood in all its varied

--aspects. Let us then confess our ignorance, and conclude in the sublime words of

Anatomy and Physiology.

Address bxj Professor A. Macalistee, M.D., M.R.I.A.

Dubing the thirty-six years which have elapsed since the former meeting of the

British Association at Plymouth, in the year 1841, the whole aspect and position of

the system of sciences now grouped under the name of Biology have undergone a e< im-
plete change. Then they were little more than crude and disconnected clusters of
facts, whereas now they have become sciences so organic in their unity and so phi-

losophic in their basis that they have risen wholly above the reproach which the
cultivators of the mathematical sciences were once wont to cast upon the biologist.

More especially is this true of that corner of the scientific vineyard which it it.s

the business of this department to cultivate, the two sciences of Anatomy and

Physiology, of which it is not enough to say that they have made enormous ad-

vances, for they have become remodelled in almost every respect. Then the busi-

ness of this department was supposed to be purely medical, as can be seen from
the record of the sectional proceedings at that meeting, when the subjects considered
were such as scald head, opium, squinting, and dropsy. From these narrow limits

we are now emancipated ; Anatomy, in its true scientific sense of Animal Morphology,
and a truly scientific Physiology have now become no mere adjuncts to a profes-
sional education, but have won for themselves a very prominent place among in-

dependent sciences.

This year the department of Anatomy and Physiology meets under singularly

favourable auspices. Our sciences have had the honour of supplying a President,

one peculiarly our own, to the entire collective body of the British Association

and as in the animal body the special characters of the head impress themselves

throughout the whole extent of the organism, so in our own body corporate we are

naturally to expect that an Anatomical President will give to the Department of

Anatomy and Physiology the stimulus of an increased and vigorous vitality.

Owing to the rapidly increasing general interest in Biological Science and to the

increased facilities for research, every year adds largely to our stock of facts, so

largely, indeed, in point of detail, that a single year's advances in knowledge suffice

--to fill more than one portly volume. In two directions especially has our know-

ledge progressed in pure Physiology/,where it trenches on the domain of Physical

Science, and in Embryology.

As in the science of Sociology, for the right understanding of any institution, our

most philosophical method of study consists in an examination of the conditions

which led to its origin and of the influences under which such an institution has

grown up, so in our efforts after the comprehension of the organology of the living

body, we can only hope for an adequate understanding of the nature of its compo-

nent parts by a parallel course of study, an examination of the first appearance of

the organ and of its primitive nature, together with a view of the external condi-

tions which acted on it, inducing internal reactions and consequent alterations with-

out. It is along the lines of this method of research that the largest amount of

progress has been made in Morphology during the past few years ; and in this direc-
tion the most rapid future advances may be expected. Each animal attains unto

its adult condition by a devious course of growth , which here and there exhibits

strange complications, shadows, apparently the precursors of coming events settling

down and then vanishing, transitory conditions appearing and disappearing.

In this field of research the number of labourers has been increasing from year

to year; and by the improvements which are rapidly being made in methods of

work, an abundant harvest of important results is being gathered in, which is

widening and strengthening the basis of the science of Morphology. In the list of

those whose labours have conduced to place the science of Embryology in its pre-
sent position, no name stands higher than that of Allen Thomson.

The records of Embryological research for the past few years contain many im-

portant additions to our knowdedgo concerning fundamental parts of this science

some relate to the early formation and primary developmental changes in the egg,

and others elucidate later and more specialized conditions of embryonic structure-.

myIn dealing with this part of  amsubject I  in considerable difficulties, as I find

myself forestalled in some respects by the President, and hesitate to intrude into the

domain which his master-hand has so clearly elucidated.

  Among the researches of the first group I woidd briefly refer to the elaborate

observations made by E. van Beneden, Biitschli, Jhering, and Oscar Hertwig, on

the primary changes in the ova at the first beginning of development. It had long

ago been noticed that (as our President reminded us) the disappearance of the ger-

minal vesicle is one of the most universal of the early conditions of incipient growth

in the fertilized egg, and the ultimate fate of this nucleus of the egg has been sought

for carefully and with varying, but unsatisfactory, results. In 1845 Frey described

that at certain early stages one or more singular bodies were found external to the

yolk, but within the egg ; and other observers, especially Robin, noticed that these
TRANSACTIONS OK THE SECTIONS.                                       8'J

masses are extruded at one pole of the vitelline mass. To these the name polar

bodies, or RicldtmgsbUischm, direction-vesicles, has been given ; and it has been

conjectured that the appearance of these corpuscles is in some way related to the

vanishing of the germinal vesicle. The three problems which this primary stage of
development presents for solution are :--1st, AVhat is the method whereby the sti-

mulus to development directly operates on the egg? 2nd, What becomes of the

germinal vesicle P and 3rd, In what manner and from what source the direction-

corpuscles arise, and what function do they serve in the animal economy?
   In relation to the first inquiry, the researches of E. van Beneden * and of many

others show that on the surface of the ovum, in the mammal, spermatic nuclei are
observable before development ; and the careful researches of Oscar Hertwigt, and,

after him, of Fol show that in the purple Sea-urchin (Stronr/i/locentroUis liridus)

the nucleus or head of one of these traverses the vitelline membrane of each egg,

enters the yolk, and therein travels until it reaches the nucleus of the egg ; where-

upon the two, by fusion, form the segmentation-nucleus, which then begins to

cleave and to set tip the conditions which we formerly looked upon as primary in

the developing egg. In certain Leeches also, Ilertwig f has shown that the entrance
of the spermatozoa takes place in the same way; and in the egg of the Frog the
track of the entering nucleus has been even more easily observed, being indicated

Weby a streak of clear protoplasm in the midst of the dark pigment of the egg.

may correlate with this Auerbach's§ observation, that in certain Nematodes nuclei

become approximated in the egg, and thereby originate the segmentation-nucleus;

and while the exact nature of the burrowing nucleus has been questioned by

Butschli, yet Hertwig's discovery of a tailed spermatic nucleus burrowing into the

egg in Strongyhccntrotus, and a similar instance quoted by him from Hensen,
together with the absence of any probability or reason to the contrary, seem to

render it certain that the ingoing nucleus is cither an unaltered spermatozoon, or

(though this is less probable) a compound nucleus of vitelline and spermatozoal

elements, as E. van Beneden has surmised.

In the second place, as to the fate of the germinal vesicle, the results of observa-

tions have been various, although reconcilable.  Thus, Oellacher describes that
                                                                                                                                                ||

in the eggs of the Trout the germinal vesicle is emitted, having first reached the

surface ; Goette f finds that in the bombardier frog (Bombinator) the germinal
vesicle seems to vanish without visibly approaching the periphery; while Butschli

finds that in Nematodes the vesicle is extruded as a direction-corpuscle, and Van

Beneden states -that at least some of the materials of the vesicle are extruded

Ilertwig, who has studied these transformations in Leeches with great care, describes

that at the beginning of development the nucleolus or germinal spot first appears

amoeboid, then divides, while simultaneously the wall of the germinal vesicle thins

and vanishes, its place being marked by a clear non-granular space, within which a

spindle-like body forms, consisting of a central plate of granules, formed from the

broken-up nucleus, and rays of protoplasm disposed in two tapering cones fore and

aft from this central " nuclear plate," as Strasburger has called it, the whole being
a somewhat closterimn-like or caraway-seed-like figure, at each of whose extremi-

ties there is a clear space surrounded by an aureole of star-like rays in the proto-

plasm of the egg. The material of this spindle, or carylolytic figure, as it is called,

is derived from the germinal spot and from some of the original protoplasmic con-

tents of the now indistinguishable germinal vesicle. Approaching the surface, one

of the points of the spindle makes a hillock or projection on the periphery of the

egg, then the nuclear plate divides transversely, one layer being displaced outwards

into the papilla, while the other remains within the circumference of the egg-

sphere.

   The papilla then becomes constricted off from the surface of the egg, and forms

a nearly isolated sphere, the first of tli9 direction-corpuscles, while a second ra-

diating system arises in an unknown manner within the egg, and, approaching the
still included half of the first spindle, forms with it a second spindle, which, by a

similar process, gives rise to the second direction-corpuscle.

  A third radiating system then appears, similar in most respects to the preceding

one, but having in its centre a small nucleus, which, becoming vacuolated, ulti-
mately combines with the nucleus of the included end of the last spindle, derived
from the nuclear plate, and forms with it the segmentation-nucleus. This third
radiating centre Hertwig believes, from its close similarity to the second or Samen-

kern of the Sea-urchin egg, to be the spermatic nucleus.

   From these and other confirmatory observations, which time forbids me to refer
to, we are warranted in drawing the conclusion that the germinal vesicle is not

entirely expelled, but that it undergoes a transformation, mixing in part with the
neighbouring yolk, and, having usually parted with a portion of its substance in the
form of the Richtungsblaschen, it supplies one essential element to the formation of

the segmentation-nucleus for further development.

   On the third line of inquiry, namely, as to the nature and origin of the direction-
corpuscles, there has been hitherto no accurate concordance among observers.

.Robin* describes these as derived from the homogeneous yolk-substance ; Biitschlif,
Oellacherf , and others consider them to be formed from the extruded germinal
vesicle, or at least to contain a part of that structure. Oscar Hertwig §, in this
connexion, has attempted to distinguish two kinds of bodies emitted from ova ; to
the first he limits the name IHchtungsbliisehm, and these he characterizes as always
arising by a process of budding, to which the division of the nucleus is a necessary
preliminary. Such true direction-corpuscles he considers as representing a kind of
suppressed parthenogenesis, a theory which is borne out by the observations made
by Richard Hertwig on the infusorium Spirochora gejnmipara , wherein he shows

                                                                                                                                 ||

that similar spindles are formed before fission takes place in that form. Stras-

burger^T, on the other hand, who has discovered similar bodies in the ovules of coni-

fers, supposes that by these corpuscles certain elements are got rid of, which, by
their presence, prevent development in the egg.

   From the true MichtunffsblascJien Hertwig distinguishes the simple protoplasmic
matter produced from some eggs, not by any process of budding, and apparently

with no precedent spindle-stage. These he calls, after Fol, " excretion-splieres."

   On this subject we require much additional information before we can feel war-

ranted in drawing any inferences or conclusions as to the true nature of these re-
markable bodies.

   Among the observations on special parts of later stages of embryonic growth, I

--shall ask your attention specially to two sets of recent researches : 1st, those on

the primitive groove of the fertilized egg ; and 2nd, those on the embryology of

limbs.

   As most of my hearers are aware, Prof. Dursy ** first described, several years

ago, that in one of the earliest stages of the developing embryo there is formed a
 primitive groove, which, having appeared and lasted for a short time, finally
 vanishes, being pushed out of existence by the medullary groove, the first trace of
 origin of the spinal cord. This arrangement, singular from its transitoriness, has
naturally attracted much attention, and various hypotheses have been advanced
 to account for its existence ; some, like the veteran embryologist Kolliker, have
 expressed their belief that this groove is but a continuation of the medullary groove,
 with which, prior to Dursy's discrimination, it had always been confounded, and

 that its margins, the primitive folds, are simple extensions of the medullary folds

 but such a view fails to account for its obvious distinctness, for its frequent want
 of symmetrytt, for the evident fusion beneath it of the embryonic layers, epi- and
 mesoblast, and probably also, at its hinder end, of the hypoblast (though Kolliker

denies this*) ; in fact, for a single peculiarity among them any which characterize

this primitive groove.
    Mr. Schafer, of University College, conceives this groove to be an infolding of

the epiblast or outer layer of the embryo, which then expanding laterally, forms
the mesoblast by a process of lateral cell-growth ; and his sections of the embryonic
Guinea-pig show clearly that from the fusion of layers which constitute the axis-
cord of His at the bottom of the primitive groove, the laterally outgrowing mass of

mesoblast can be seen to spring. Those who adopt the view of Kblliker and

Hensen, that the mesoblast is derived from the epiblast, will probably regard this

hypothesis, or some modification of it, with favour ; but if (as I am from my own

observations personally inclined) we regard the mesoblast as a derivative from the

inner embryonic layer, then we are forced to look elsewhere for an explanation of

the appearance.

  Our own English embryologist, Mr. Balfour, whom as a fellow member of the

British Association we delight to honour, has made this groove the subject of ex-

amination, and has correlated it with the change in position of the embryo on the

surface of the germinal disk. He has shown that in the egg of the bird or mammal

the embryo from the first appears in the centre of the blastoderm, while in more

generalized forms, such as the Shark, the first trace of the embryo is marginal

and from this position it gradually recedes, as in the growth of the blastoderm,

over the surface of the yolk the former extends more rapidly at each side of the

embryo than it does opposite the embiyo itself, and in the course of development

the two headlands which border the bay at whose fundus the embryonic shark

appears, approximate and unite mesially, forming a sutural fine leading from the

margin of the embryo to the edge of the blastoderm. He considers that in the

highly specialized form of the bird or mammal the primitive groove is the heirloom

of this ancestral change in condition; and if we correlate with this historic evi-

dence such appearances as the marginal notch in the germinal disk, described by

Professor llaubert of Leipzig, and considered by him as the ideal hinder edge of

the primitive groove, we can, I believe, make out an almost overwhelming c,

favour of this theory, more especially as we cannot but believe that the change

which Balfour postulates has taken place, and that this, in accordance with mor-

phological analogy, should leave some trace of its having existed behind it.

Prof. Baubert, who has also written several papers on this subject, has con-

sidered this groove to be a trace of the opening of invagination of the hypoblast, a

groove continuous with the extremity of the blastopore, or primitive mouth, of

which, indeed, he supposes it to form a part. This view is based principally on

the dorsal extension of the blastopore in Amphioxus and in Ascidians§, and on the

general evidence of the origin of the hypoblast by invagination, as well as on the

observed  fusion of  the hypo- and                            mesoblast  at the  hinder end of the                                                            groove and
                                                                                                                                                           _

their separateness anteriorly. As the blastopore is placed at the hinder end of the

embryo, at the bottom of the bay of blastoderm, and as the neural and hypoblastic

canals are here confluent, as are the primitive and medullary grooves, this may be

one factor in the formation of the groove, at least of its anterior extremity. Into

the larger question of the origin of the mesoblast time forbids our entering.

I shall now very briefly direct your attention to a second series of embryological

res. -arches, viz. those on the earliest formation and ontogeny of limbs.

In his remarkable and suggestive series of papers on the development of Elasmo-

branchs,  Mr.  Balfour                                        describes the first appearance of  the limb to be a thickened

a continuous lateral fin. In later stages of development themesoblast beneath this

ridge thickens, projects, and, being substituted for the epiblast, forms the chief

substance of the limb as it afterwards exists. In the rabbit-embryo Kollikerf like-

 ·wise describes the same condition, a primarily epiblastic superficial process, replaced,

 as development progresses, by a mesoblaslic outgrowth ; and in the bird-embryo

Foster and Balfour, Kolliker, and others describe similar stages. Here we have

--two very remarkable conditions first, an indication that the primitive vertebrate

 form possessed an epiblastic system of appendages ; and, secondly, that the limbs
 are the remnants of a continuous lateral fin. To the first hypothesis, that the pri-
 mary appendicular system was epiblastic, there are no ontological objections ; for

in such generalized forms among Vermes as Sagitta we have lateral epiblastic fin-
 processes, which, like the hooks of Peripatus or the bristles of Polychceta, may well
indicate allied epiblastic forms of archaic protovertebral limbs. As the surviving

forms of protovertebrates, such as the Tunicates and Amphioxus, as well as the

lowest craniotes, like the Lampreys, are limbless, they give us no information as to

the primary condition, as this deficiency may in them be due to obsolescence*.
Thus, as from the now classic researches of Ivleinenbergt, we have learned that,

in the primitive Metazoa there was a primary muscular system derived from the
epiblast, which has vanished in higher forms of animals, being replaced by a secon-
dary musculature of mesoblastic origin, and with the mesoblast derived, at least

in Invertebrates and Ichthyopsids, from the hypoblast, so we have now learned

that there was probably iu the protovertebrates an epiblastic appendage system,

which, having no inherent muscular apparatus, and being incapable of sufficient

specialization, vanished or became rudimental, and was replaced by the more per-
manent and more plastic mesoblastic limbs.

   The second point is of still greater interest, namely, that Embryology supplies
us with demonstrative evidence that the limbs are the remains of a continuous

lateral fin. This Mr. Balfour has found to be the case in Elasmobranchs, and there
are traces of similar though shadowy thickenings along the Wolffian ridge in frogs
and in birds. But while the epiblastic ridges are thus continuous, the mesoblastic

enlargements are much more indistinctly so, even from the first, exhibiting the two-

fold arrangement of fore and hinder linibs.

    I cannot forbear in this connexion referring to a closely related point in the
general subject of the morphology of limbs.

   The vertebrate animal is primarily composed of a chain of similar segments, and

there is no a priori reason in morphology why any one metamere should not bear
limbs as well as any other. Nay, from the analogy of Chsetopod worms, we might

expect that, as in these, each zonite usually bears two pairs of parapodia or stumpy

foot-processes, so in similarly derived and similarly segmented forms there might
be at least traces of a similar multiplication of appendages.

   In effect, we really do find a somewhat parallel series in the metameres of fishes

for, as Mr. Balfour has shown, the mediodorsal fin comes into existence precisely

in the same manner as the lateral fin-ridge ; and being a double structure, as we

learn both in its specialized form and even in the structure of the cartilaginous

precursor of the interspinous boues, it may reasonably be supposed to represent

structures homologous with the system of notopodia in a laterally compressed

worm, fused together, while the paired fins may be regarded as the neuropodia,

separated by the visceral cavity, and which in the degraded and compressed meta-
meres behind the visceral cavity also coalesce, forming another primary ridge, that
of the anal and caudal fin.

   In relation to the primary source of origin and method of derivation of limbs,

we have to account for two separate factors, the limb-girdle and the limb-rays
with regard to the former, I can now only refer to the hypothesis of Gegenbaur

--and Dohrn, that the limb-girdles represent modifications of the visceral arches, and

I pass this by with two comments : 1st, that the visceral arches are themselves, to

--a certain extent, specialized, and, consequently, it would be better to state the

hypothesis^ thus that the limb-girdles and visceral arches are specializations of
corresponding paraxial structures in different metameres ; 2nd, in the light of the
evident fundamental complexity of the limb-girdles, it seems a simpler explanation
of phenomena to regard each girdle as made up of the arches of several (probably
three or more metameres fused) rather than as subdivisions of a single arch.

   As to the primary nature of the limb-ray, Professors Huxley and Gegenbaur

have taught us, in their recent reconstruction*' of the theory of the archipterygium,

that the primitive limb was constructed somewhat like the limb-ray of Cerutodus,

having a central jointed axis from which diverge, fore and aft, lateral processes,
or, to use the elegant nomenclature of Professor Huxley, "the primitive vertebrate
limb consisted of a column of mesomeres, to each of which a lateral pre- and post-

axial paramere was articulated."

But even this form, though doubtless the stock from which the limbs of all ver-
tebrates above the Dipnoi have sprung, is regarded, and with reason, by Gegenbaur
as a derivative one, formed by the coalescence of a still more archaic arrangement
of rays appended to the paraxial arches referred to above. It is possible that the
primary fusion may have taken such a form as that which Gegenbaur represented
         original archipterygium, with more than one cartilage appended to the
in his
girdle,  a form of which the arrangement in the Dog-fish and Angel-shark may be

representative; and these, by a still further concentration, attended with an exal-

tation of the mesopterygium and a displacement of the propterygium as in Ilcv-

anchus, or of the pro- and metapterygium, as in Cestracion, may thus reach the

elongated form of the limb in Dipnoi. It seems obvious that this fish, Ceratodus,
though singularly generalized, has arisen from a point in the vertebrate stem above

the starting-point of the Elasmobranchs.

   Whether this has been tho case or no, whether the Elasmobranch has been de-

rived from an earlier condition than the Dipnoan progenitor or no, the researches
of Professor Huxley have made it plain that it is from the meso- and not from the
rnetapterymmi that the single basal ray-bone of the higher vertebrates has arisen.

  A curious question will naturally occur to any one considering the genesis of

limbs--What is the reason that, in vertebrate animals, the number of limbs is
limited, and apparently has been always limited, to four ? And as we have seen

that there is an ontological possibility that each of these contains elements from
several metanieres, there is no morphological reason, and therefore must be some

mechanical cause, for this limitation. Were the primitive vertebrates terrestrial,
we could understand that the tetrapod has a mechanical advantage over the tripod

or any condition with an inferior number of limbs, both statically, from the inde-
terminateness of the strain on each support in the four-legged form, and in pro-
gression, from the easily understood conditions of stability of equilibrium in walk-
in^ · while the tetrapod excels the hexapod or millepede, not only because, by a
reduction in number, the amount of nutrition required for the use of the limbs is

minimized, but it is absolutely demonstrable that the facility of rotation is increased

by the reduction of the limbs to the lowest number consistent with other conditions
of utility. In connexion with this point, Professor Haughton has made some
curious observations, the results of wliich I hope we shall have laid before us in

this department during our present meeting.
But the earliest vertebrates were aquatic ; and yet even here we find the four-
fold division of these actinal appendages. These primitive forms differed from
worms in the greater amount'of fusion of their metanieres, which at an early period
had ceased to°give to these animals an externally jointed appearance, as we may
leam from Amphioxus, which has branched from the vertebrate stem long before
most of the secondary characters, which are constant throughout the rest of the
vertebrates, had been foreshadowed. Being thus more consolidated than worms, and
movin"-, as they would necessarily do, more as a unit and less as a chain, the ad-
vantages of the mode of propulsion by a tail over swimming by means of the con-
tinuous lateral fin of united parapodia would be increasingly manifest with in-
creasing somatic rigidity. Hence, naturally, the parapodia of the hinder somites
would coalesce to form a tail, as they have done in fishes, and theappendages
placed further forward would undergo retrogression, unless some fmiction could bo
"found for them which would make their retention an advantage in the economy.
                          forms like Lampreys, such a retrogression has absolutely taken

most fishes ; and they not only act in elevation and depression, but in lateral rota-

tion, as any one can verify for himself by watching fishes in an aquarium. In

order to accommodate these united lateral appendages most conveniently to the

sinuous curves into which the body of a fish is thrown in swimming, and to di-

minish the surface of resistance to the water, the parapodia have divided them-

selves into two groups, leaving the centre of the body, where the cephalic and

caudal curves meet during progression, free from lateral appendages..

   Time would fail to permit me to catalogue the many other recent additions to our

knowledge of Ontogeny derived from Embryology, so I must draw to a conclusion

by referiing very briefly to the department of morphological science with which my
own daily work brings me most closely into contact, viz. that of Human Anatomy.

   Considering the limited field, and the care with which the human body has been
scrutinized for so many years, it is easily understood that the amount of annual

progress is inconsiderable, except in matters of minute detail; still every year

gives to us a solid addition to our knowledge ; and of the fruits of the past year's
work^ I would refer, in passing, to the papers of Bernays on the development of

the Auriculo-ventricular Valves, of Klein on the Histology of the Omentum, and
of Herbert Watney on the Distribution of the Connective Reticulum throughout

the whole alimentary canal.

   In matters of detail it is still surprising how much yet remains to be done even
in this much wrought department. In a subject so personally interesting as that
Humanof Anatomy, it is surely of practical utility, if not of scientific interest, that

we should have correct and broadly based statements regarding averages of con-

ditions in the case of the variable structures of the human body (and what part is

not variable F). In the dissecting-rooms of Great Britain and Ireland there are at
least six hundred hiunan bodies examined annually, and yet there are few variable

structures concerning which we have observations made on any thing like such a

numerical basis.

   It has been the fashion on the part of certain anatomists to disparage the work

of those who observe and collate such cases of variety ; but surely such a method

of regarding any group of constantly recurring morphological facts is unphiloso-

pbical, even though the bearing of the facts be not at first sight obvious ; and until

we know the laws of whose operations these so-called anomalies are special cases,

on general principles it becomes the business of the anatomist to collect, collate,
and record these cases. Thanks to the researches of the laborious and indefati-

gable Prof. Wenzel Gruber, of St. Petersburg, that prince of descriptive anatomists,
and to those of others too numerous to mention, the anatomical text-books of to-day
are much more definite than they were thirty years ago. Yet much still requires

to be done ; and in even our most recent hand-books we often seek in vain for

information on points of descriptive anatomy. Surely it is to be hoped, and not

too  much   to expect,      that  in  a  few  years  some of  the many small lacunae in our
                         _

knowledge will be filled up, and the study of human anatomy will become, not a

mere matter of words and names, as it has in too many respects been hereto-

fore, but a really scientific study, a practical application of sound morphological

principle.

  Address to the Department of Anthropology. By Feancis Galton, F.R.S.

Permit me to say a few words of personal explanation to account for the form
of the Address I am about to offer. It has been the custom of my predecessors to
give an account of recent proceedings in Anthropology, and to touch on many
branches of that wide subject. But I am at this moment unprepared to follow their

example with the completeness I should desire and you have a right to expect,
owing to the suddenness with which I have been called upon to occupy this chair.
I had, indeed, the honour of being nominated to the post last spring ; but circum-

stances arising -which made it highly probable that I should bo prevented from

attending this meeting, I was compelled to ask to be superseded. New arrange-

ments were then made by the Council, and I thought no more about the matter.
I lowever, at the last moment, the accomplished ethnologist who otherwise would

have presided over you was himself debarred by illness from attending, and the

original plan had to be reverted to.

Under these circumstances I thought it best to depart somewhat from the usual

form of Addresses, and to confine myself to certain topics with which I happen to

have been recently engaged, even at the risk of incurring the charge of submitting

to you a memoir rather than an address.

   I propose to speak of the study of those groups of men who are sufficiently

similar in their mental characters or in their physiognomy, or in both, to admit of

classification and I especially desire to show that many methods exist of pursuing
                                                                        ;

the inquiry in a strictly scientific manner, although it has hitherto been too often

conducted with extreme laxity.

The types of character of which I speak are such as those described by Theo-

phrastus, La Bruyere, and others, or such as may be read of in ordinary literature

and are universally recognized as being exceedingly true to nature. There are no

worthier professors of this branch of Anthropology than the writers of the higher

works of fiction, who are ever on the watch to discriminate varieties of character,

and who have the art of describing them. It would, I think, be a valuable service

to Anthropology if some person well versed in literature were to compile a volume

of extracts from novels and plays that should illustrate the prevalent types of human

character and temperament. What, however, I especially wish to point out is, that

it ha3 of late years become possible to pursue an inquiry into certain fundamental

qualities of the mind by the aid of exact measurements. Most of you are aware of

the recent progress of what has been termed Psycho-physics, or the science of sub-

jecting mental processes to physical measurements and to physical laws. I do not

now propose to speak of the laws that have been deduced, such as that which is

known by the name of Fechner, and its numerous offshoots, including the law of

fatigue ; but I will briefly allude to a few instances of measurement of mental pro-

cesses, merely to recall them to your memory. They will show, what I desire to lay

stress upon, that the very foundations of the differences between the mental qualities

of man and man admit of being gauged by a scale of inches and a clock.

Take, for example, the rate at which a sensation or a volition travels along the

Wenerves, which has been the subject of numerous beautiful experiments.  now

loiow that it is far from instantaneous, having, indeed, no higher velocity than that

of a railway express train. This slowness of pace, speaking relatively to the require-

ments that the nerves have to fulfil, is quite sufficient to account for the fact that

very small animals are quicker than very large ones in evading rapid blows, and

for the other fact that the eye and the ear are situated in almost all animals in the

head, in order that as little time as possible should be lost on the road in trans-

Nowmitting their impressions to the brain.  the velocity of the complete process

of to and fro nerve-transmission in persons of different temperaments has not been

yet ascertained with the desired precision. Such difference, as there may be, is

obviously a fundamental characteristic, and one that well deserves careful examina-

tion. I may take this opportunity of suggesting a simple inquiry that would throw

much light on the degree in which its velocity varies in different persons, and how

far it is correlated with temperament and external physical characteristics. Before

I describe the inquiry I suggest, and towards which I have already collected a few

data, it is necessary that I should explain the meaning of a term in common use

among astronomers, namely "personal equation." It is a well-known fact that

different observers make different estimates of the exact moment of the occurrence

of any event. There is a common astronomical observation, in which the moment

has to be recorded at which a star that is travelling across the field of view of a

fixed telescope crosses the fine vertical wire by which that field of view is inter-

sected. In making this observation it is found that some observers are over-san-

guine and anticipate the event, while others are sluggish and allow the event to

pass by before they succeed in noting it. Tins is by no means the effect of inex-

perience or maladroitness, but it is a persistent characteristic of each individual,
--96 report 1877.

however practised in the art of making observations, or however attentive he may

be. The difference between the time of a man's noting the event and that of its

actual occurrence is called his personal equation. It remains curiously constant in

every case for successive years, it is carefully ascertained for every assistant in every

observatory, it is published along with his observations, and is applied to them just

as a correction would be applied to measurements made by a foot-rule that was

known to be too long or too short by some definite amount. Therefore the magni-

tude of a man's personal equation indicates a very fundamental peculiarity of his

constitution ; and the inquiry I would suggest is to make a comparison of the age,
height, weight, colour of hair and eyes, and temperament (so far as it may admit of

definition) in each observer in the various observatories at home and abroad, with
Wethe amount of his personal equation.
                                             should thus learn how far the more

obvious physical characteristics may be correlated with certain mental ones, and

we should perhaps obtain a more precise scale of temperaments than we have at

present.

   Another subject of exact measurement is the time occupied in forming an ele-

mentary judgment. If a simple signal be suddenly shown, and if the observer

presses a stop as quickly as he can when he sees it, some little time will certainly

be lost, owing to delay in nerve-transmission and to the sluggishness of the me-
chanical apparatus. In making experiments on the rate of judgment, the amount
of this interval is first ascertained. Then the observer prepares himself for the
exhibition of a signal that may be either black or white, but he is left ignorant

which of the two it will be. Ho is to press a stop with his right hand in the first

event, and another stop with his left hand in the second one. The trial is then
made, and a much longer interval is found to have elapsed between the exhibition
of the alternative signal and the record of it than had elapsed when a simple signal
was used. There has been hesitation and delay : in short, the simplest act of judg-
ment is found to consume a definite time. It is obvious that here, again, we have

means of ascertaining differences in the rapidity of forming elementary judgments

and of classifying individuals accordingly.

It would be easy to pursue the subject of the measurement of mental qualitii s

to considerable length, by describing other kinds of experiment, for they are numer-

ous and varied. Among these is the plan of Professor Jevons, of suddenly exhi-

biting an unknown number of beans in a box, and requiring an estimate of their

Anumber to be immediately called out.  comparison of the estimate with the fact,

in a large number of trials, brought out a very interesting scale of the accuracy of

such estimates, which would of course vary in different individuals, and might bo

used as a means of classification. I can imagine few greater services to Anthro-

pology than the collection of the various experiments that have been imagined to
reduce the faculties of the mind to exact measurement. They have engaged the

attention of the highest philosophers, but have never, so far as I am aware, been

brought compendiously together, and have certainly not been introduced, as they

deserve, to general notice.

  Wherever we are able to perceive differences by intercomparison, we may rea-
sonably hope that we may at some future time succeed in submitting those differ-

ences to measurement. The history of science is the history of such triumphs. I

will ask your attention to a very notable instance of this, namely, that of the esta-

blishment of the scale of the thermometer. You are aware that the possibility of

making a standard thermometric scale wholly depends upon that of determining
two fixed points of temperature, the interval between them being graduated into a
scale of equal parts. These points are, I need hardly say, the temperatures of freezing

and of boiling water respectively. On this basis we are able to record temperature

with minute accuracy, and the power of doing so has been one of the most important

Weaids to Physics and Chemistry as well as to other branches of investigation.

have been so accustomed from our childhood to hear of degrees of temperature,

and our scientific knowledge is so largely based upon exact thermometric measure-

ment, that we cannot easily realize the state of science when the thermometer,
as we now use it, was unknown, Yet such was the condition of affairs so recently
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     97

as two hundred years ago, or thereabouts. The invention of the thermometer, in
its present completo form, was largely due to Boyle ; and I find in his Memoirs

(London, 1772, vol. vi. p. 403) a letter that cannot fail to interest us, since it well
expresses the need of exact measurement that was thou felt in a particidar case,
where it was soon eminently well supplied, and therefore encourages hope that our

present needs as Anthropologists may hereafter, in some way or other, be equally
well satisfied. The letter is from Dr. John Beale, a great friend and correspondent

of Boyle, and is dated February, 1663. Tie says in it :

   " I see by several of my own thermometers, that the glass-men are by you so well

instructed to make the stems in equal proportions, that if we could name some
degrees, ... we might by the proportions of the glass make our discourses intel-
ligible in mentioning what degrees of cold our greatest frosts do produce. ... If
we can discourse of heat aud cold in their several degrees, so as we may signify the
same intelligibly, ... it is more than our forefathers have taught us to do

hitherto."

   The principal experiments by which the mental faculties may be measured

require, unfortunately for us, rather costly and delicate apparatus ; and until phy-

siological laboratories are more numerous than at present, we can hardly expect
that they will be pursued by many persons.

   Let us now suppose that, by one or more of the methods I have described or alluded
to, we have succeeded in obtaining a group of persons resembling one another in
some mental quality, and that we desire to determine the external physical charac-
teristics and features most commonly associated with it. I have nothing new to

say as regards the usual anthropometric measurements ; but I wish to speak of the

great convenience of photographs in conveying those subtle but clearly visible pecu-
liarities of outline which almost elude measurement. It is strange that no use is

made of photography to obtain careful studies of the head and features. No single
view can possibly exhibit the whole of a solid, but we require for that purpose views

to be taken from three points at right angles to one another. Just as the architect

requires to know the elevation, side view, and plan of a house, so the Anthropologist

ought to have the full face, profile, and view of the head from above of the indi-
vidual whose features he is studying.

   It might be a great convenience, when numerous portraits have to be rapidly

and inexpensively taken for the purpose of anthropological studies, to arrange a
solid framework supporting three mirrors, that shall afford the views of which I

have been speaking, by reflexion, at the same moment that the direct picture of

the sitter is taken. He woidd present a three-quarter face to the camera for the

direct picture, one adjacent mirror would reflect his profile towards it, another on the
opposite side would reflect his full face, and a third sloping over him would reflect
the head as seen from above. All the reflected images would lie at the same
optical distance from the camera, and woidd therefore be on the same scale, but
they would be on a somewhat smaller scale than the picture taken directly. The
result would be an ordinary photographic picture of the sitter, surrounded by three

different views of his head. Scales of inches attached to the framework would
appear in the picture and give the means of exact measurement.

   Having obtained drawings or photographs of several persons alike in most
respects, but differing in minor details, what sure method is there of extracting the

typical characteristics from them ? I may mention a plan which had occurred both

to Mr. Herbert Spencer and myself, the principle of which is to superimpose opti-

cally the various drawings and to accept the aggregate result. Mr. Spencer sug-

gested to me in conversation that the drawings reduced to the same scale might be

traced on separate pieces of transparent paper and secured one upon another, and

then held between the eye and the light. I have attempted this with some success.

My own idea was to throw faint images of the several portraits, in succession, upon

the same sensitized photographic plate. I may add that it is perfectly easy to

superimpose optically two portraits by means of a stereoscope, and that a person

who is used to handle instruments will rind a common double eyeglass fitted with

1877.                                 8
--98 report 1877.

stereoscopic lenses to be almost as effectual andfar handier than the boxes sold in

shops.

   In illustration of what I have said about photographic portraits, I will allude to

some recent experiences of my own in a subject that I have still under considera-
tion. In previous publications I have treated of men who have been the glory of
mankind ; I would now call your attention to those who are its disgrace. The
particular group of men I have in view are the criminals of England, who have

been condemned to long terms of penal servitude for various heinous offences.

  It is needless to enlarge on the obvious fact that many persons have become con-

victs who, if they had been afforded the average chances of doing well, would have
lived up to a fair standard of virtue. Neither need I enlarge on the other equally

obvious fact, that a very large number of men escape criminal punishment who in
reality deserve it quite as much as an average convict. Making eveiy allowance
for these two elements of uncertainty, no reasonable man can entertain a doubt

that the convict class includes a large proportion of consummate scoundrels, and

that we are entitled to expect to find in any large body of convicts a prevalence of
the truly criminal characteristics, whatever these may be.

    Criminality, though not very various in its development, is extremely complex

in its origin ; nevertheless certain general conclusions are arrived at by the best

writers on the subject, among whom I would certainly rank Prosper Despine. The

ideal criminal has three peculiarities of character : his conscience is almost deficient,

his instincts are vicious, and his power of self-control is very weak. As a conse-

--quence of all this he usually detests continuous labour. This statement applies to

the criminal classes generally the special conditions that determine the descrip-

tion of crime being the character of the instincts, and the fact of the absence of

self-control being due to ungovernable temper, or to passion, or to mere imbecility.
    The deficiency of conscience in criminals, as shown by the absence of genuine

remorse for their guilt, appears to astonish all who first become familiar with the

 details of prison life. Scenes of heartrending despair are hardly ever witnessed

--among prisoners ; their sleep is broken by no uneasy dreams on the contrary, it

 is easy and sound; they have also excellent appetites. But hypocrisy is a

very common vice ; and all my information agrees in one particular, as to the

 utter untruthfulness of criminals, however plausible their statements may appear

 to be.

    The subject of vicious instincts is a very large one : we must guard ourselves against
 looking upon them as perversions, inasmuch as they may be strictly in accordance
 with the healthy nature of the man, and, being transmissible by inheritance, may

 become the normal characteristics of a healthy race, just as the sheep-dog, the
 retriever, the pointer, and the bull-dog have their several instincts. There can be

 no greater popular error than the supposition that natural instinct is a perfectly

 trustworthy guide, for there are striking contradictions to such an opinion in indi-

 viduals of every description of animal. All that we are entitled to say is, that

 the prevalent instincts of each race are trustworthy, not those of every individual.

 A man who is counted as an atrocious criminal by society, and is punished as such

 by the law, may nevertheless have acted in strict accordance with his instincts.

 The ideal criminal is deficient in qualities that oppose his vicious instincts ; he has

 neither the natural regard for others which lies at the base of conscience, nor has

 he sufficient self-control to enable him to consider his own selfish interests in the
 long run. He cannot be preserved from criminal misadventure, either by altruistic

 or by intelligently egoistic sentiments.

It becomes an interesting question to know how far these peculiarities may be

correlated with physical characteristics and features. Through the cordial and

ready assistance of Sir Edmimd Du Cane, the Surveyor-General of Prisons, who

has himself contributed a valuable memoir to the Social Science Congress on the

subject, I was enabled to examine the many thousand photographs of criminals that

are preserved for purposes of identification at the Home Office, to visit prisons and

myconfer with the authorities, and lastly to procure for  own private statistical
                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     99

inquiries a large number of copies of photographs of heinous criminals. I may as
well say that I begged that the photographs should be furnished me without any

names attached to them, but simply classified in three groups, according to the
nature of the crime. The first group included murder, manslaughter, and burglary ·

the second group included felony and forgery; and the third group referred to
sexual crimes.                             The photographs
terms of penal                                                                     wore  of  criminals who  had been  sentenced  to  lon°°-
                                          servitude.

By familiarizing myself with the collection, and continually sorting the photo-
graphs in tentative ways, certain natural classes began to appear, some of which

are exceedingly well marked. It was also very evident that the three groups of
criminals contributed in very different proportions to the different physiognomic

myThis is not the place to go further into details : indeed                                                        inquiry is far from
complete. I merely quote my experiences in order to show the way in which ques-
tions of character, physiognomy, and temperament admit of being scientifically

approached, and to give an instance of the helpfulness of photography. If I had
had the profiles and the shape of the head as seen from above, my results would
have               been much more instructive. Thus, to take a single instance, I have seen
                   pencil studies in outline of selected criminal faces drawn by Dr. Clarke, the
many

accomplished and zealous medical officer of Pentonville Prison ; and in these sketches

a, certain very characteristic profile seemed to me conspicuously prevalent. I should
have been very glad of photographs to corroborate this. So, again, if I had had
photographic views of the head taken from above, I could have tested, anions
other matters, the truth of Professor Benedict's assertion about the abnormally
small size of the back of the head in criminals.

I have thus far spoken of the characters and physiognomy of weD-marked

varieties of                                                    :  the Anthropologist has next to consider the life-history of   those

varieties, and especially their tendency to perpetuate themselves, whether to dis-

place other varieties and to spread, or else to die out. In illustration of this, I will
proceed with what appears to be the history of the criminal class. Its perpetua-
tion by heredity is a question that deserves more careful investigation than it has
received                                  but it is on many accounts more difficult to grapple
                                       ;                                                                    with than it may at

farst sight appear to be. The vagrant habits of the criminal classes, their illegiti-
mate unions and extreme untruthfulness are among the difficulties. It is, howe°ver
easy to show that the criminal nature tends to be inherited ; while, on the other

their life in prison can contribute many children to the popidation. The true state
of the case appears to be that the criminal population receives steady accessions

from classes who, without having strongly marked criminal natures, do nevertheless
belong to a type of humanity that is exceedingly ill-suited to play a respectable

part in our modern civilization, though they are well suited to flourish under half-
savage conditions, being naturally both healthy and prolific. These persons are apt
to goto the bad; their daughters consort with criminals and become the parents

of criminals. An extraordinary example of this is given by the history of the
infamous Jukes family in America, whose pedigree has been made out, with extra-
ordinary care, during no less than seven generations, and is the subject of an elabo-

to the 85 legitimate descendants, they were less flagrantly bad, for only 5 of them

had been in jail, and only 13 others had been paupers. Now the ancestor of all

this mischief, who was born about the year 1730, is described as having been a

hunter and a fisher, a jolly companionable man, averse to steady labour, working

hard and idling by turns, and who had numerous illegitimate children, whose issue
has not been traced. He was, in fact, a somewhat good specimen of a half-savage,
without any seriously criminal instincts. The girls were apparently attractive,

marrying early and sometimes not badly ; but the gipsy-like character of the race
was unsuited to success in a civilized country. So the descendants went to the bad,

and the hereditary moral weaknesses they may have had rose to the surface and

worked then" mischief without a check. Cohabiting with criminals, and being ex-
tremely prolific, the result was the production of a stock exceeding 500 in number,

of a prevalent criminal type. Through disease and intemperance the breed is now
rapidly diminishing ; the infant mortality has of late been horrible among them
but fortunately the women of the present generation bear usually but few children
and many of them are altogether childless.

   This is not the place to go further into details. I have alluded to the Juices
family in order to show what extremely important topics lie open to inquiry in a

single branch of anthropological research, and to stimulate others to follow it out.
There can be no more interesting subject to us than the quality of the stock of

our countrymen and of the human race generally, and there can be no more worthy
inquiry than that which leads to an explanation of the conditions under which it

deteriorates or improves.

                  On t7ie Colour of Animals. By Wm. Ackrovd.

   The tendency to change which we see in all departments of nature is perhaps
nowhere more strikingly shown than in the phenomena of colour in the animal
kingdom. The apparent seasonal change of garb by the arctic fauna, the assump-

tion of brigher colours by males than by females in the gradual change from cub-
hood to the adult state, and the fading of the tints upon the nearing of old age,
are sufficient evidences of this. The author proceeds to deal with these phenomena
from a physical standpoint.

  mRespecting colour the inorganic world, two propositions are enunciated, in

which the coloured substance is referred to as the absorbing body.

Prop. I. Alteration of atomic position in the absorbing body is accompanied by change
                   of colour.

Prop. II. is the converse of I.

               Cliange of colour in the absorbing body is an evidence of its loss or gain of

                     potential energy.

   The latter proposition the writer attempts to apply to the study of the colour of
animals, and works with the following scale, which he terms the biological meta-

chromatic scale :

                    / \ Black

                          Brown

                    Red

Increase of Animal  Orange                   Decrease of Animal

Potential Energy.   Yellow                   Potential Energy.

                    Green

                    Blue

                    White or Colourless \ /
                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      101

Thus, placing a mechanical interpretation upon colour, he considers the evidences
mof (i) gain and (ii) loss of energy
                                                        the animal kingdom, and finally deals with

(iii) adaptation to environment and (iv) colour-distribution.

 --I. Evidences of Gain of Energy. Under this head the author includes those

changes of tint in hair Sec. which take place from youth to adult age. The change

is not only seen in man, but in the Primates and other orders of animals. Sexual

differences are tabulated, and it is shown that the fact of the male being most ab-

sorptive-coloured is indicative of its having more energy than the female. The

order is reversed among the fishes.

 --II. Evidences of Loss of Energy. Greyness accompanying old age in the animal

kingdom is taken as a proof of this greyness produced by disease and the change
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

one sees in certain fishes previous to putrefaction.

 --III. Adaptation to Environment. There is reason for thinking that the winter

change in the arctic fauna is induced by rigour of climate, and is protective

against that rigour. In dealing with adaptation as manifested in the lower orders

of life, he first proceeds to show that certain well-known cases of colour-change
among chemical salts produced by light and by heat are cases of adaptation to
environment. It is shown that the cases of adaptation in the lower orders of

--animals are probably analogous, if not identical, to those among inorganic bodies.
   IV. Distribution of Colour. In the lighter tint generally found on the abdominal

parts of animals, we have a colour localized which, in the arctic regions, is distri-
buted all over. It may be similarly induced and have to serve the same end.

Those parts are most absorptive-coloured, and presumably are the best radiators of

heat, where warmth andeconomy of heat is not very necessary, as, e. g., the pri-
maries and tails of birds, and the leg-flanks, manes, and tails of quadrupeds. Brown

horses have black manes and tails.

On the Habits of the Pearly Nautilus (Nautilus pompilius).

                   By Dr. G. Bennett, F.L.S.

The author said that the idea that Nautilus and Spirula are deep-water forms is

fallacious                                              for though the Nautilus pompilius has rarely been  met with, the shells
                                                     ;

are often found on beaches in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, where, he said,

he was not aware of any deep-water mollusk ever having been cast. On the 24th

of July, 1874, however, the ' Challenger ' exploring party netted a Nautilus in

about 320 fathoms of water off Matuka Island, and for some time kept it alive in a

tub to observe it habits. It propelled itself, after the manner of Cephalopoda,

" backwards," and each pair of its tentacles was found to have a definite and diver-

gent direction. The great depth at which the ' Challenger's ' specimen was cap-

tured was so opposed to experience that Dr. Bennett felt inclined to believe it was

netted by the trawl as it passed near the reef, or as it was floating at a slight depth.

It was noticed that the ' Challenger ' Nautilus attained locomotion by ejecting

water after the manner of the Cuttlefish. The paper described the air-chambers,

by means of which the fish descends or rises at will in the water ; the muscular

funnel, by the use of which it propels itself in any direction, regardless of currents

and concluded with a comprehensive and clear description of its peculiarities.

        On Biological Results of the North-German Exploring Expedition.

                                   By Dr. Otto Einsch.

   In this paper Dr. Finsch pointed out the principal biological results of the North-

German expedition to Western Siberia. He divided the regions traversed into the

steppes, the mountains, the wooded region of the Obi, and the treeless " tundras "
north of 67° north latitude, and enumerated the most characteristic animals of each

region. Among the most important points were the occurrence of Himalayan and

Indian forms in the mountains near the Altai range, where such truly Arctic types
as the Reindeer were met with.

Remarks on the Colorado Beetle, and on the Panic existing as to the possibility

    of its becoming obnoxious in this Country. By R. M'Lachlan, F.R.S.

   The author dealt categorically with the history of the insect, its habits, its
migratory movements, and the reason the inhabitants of Europe have had to
dread its infliction upon them. The beetle, he said, has existed from time imme-
morial in the west of Colorado, on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
Until eighteen or twenty years ago it was little known except in its native
haunts or the cabinets of entomologists. In its home its larvae fed upon one or
more species of Solanmn; but when the white man migrated to Colorado he took
with him the inevitable potato (another species of Solanmn), which proved ac-
ceptable to the beetle, and which afforded it the means of prospering and in-
creasing prodigiously. Growing in numbers, the beetles spread over a wider
area, and continued their migrations, until, in about fifteen years from the time
of the introduction of the potato to them, they had travelled from their native
home to the coast of the Atlantic. But even here the insects' journeyings did not
cease ; and there is reason to believe that it has bred in Germany, and has been

present in its larval state in England. It belongs to the class of Coleopterous insects

known as Phytophaga (Vegetable-feeders), which in the larval state live upon the

--leaves of vegetables. The life-history of the insect is stated thus : The female

lays her eggs on the leaves or other part of the plant above ground. These hatch
very soon, and the larvae proceeding from them, after eating voraciously, descend
into the earth and form small cavities, in which they turn into pupae. They then

remain quiescent till the final change into the perfect beetle takes place. The
insect breeds four or five times a year in America; but it is in its larval state
that it does nearly all the injury chargeable to it. The perfect beetle is not
known to interfere much with the plants, though some say it has attacked tubers
during the hibernating period. In Europe attention was not much directed to
this formidable farmer's enemy until four or five years ago, when the danger of
importation forced people to weigh the disadvantages of a possible scourge, and
impelled entomologists to study. Laws were passed in consequence of the agita-
tion which then took place, the effect of which was virtually to put in quarantine
vessels from America which there was reason to apprehend might bring any of
the beetles. In England fear of the insect culminated in the Destructive Insect
 Bill, passed by Parliament a week or two since. But unless potatoes be imported

 in the future in far greater quantities and with less care than heretofore, the author

believes the danger of their coming concealed among tubers to be very small. It is
 certain that the beetle swarms on the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, so
 that there is every chance that it has over and over again been conveyed on

 steamers and other vessels leaving for Europe. It therefore seems not improbable

 that a few should have arrived here promiscuously. The opinion expressed in the
 paper was that the pest is more likely to be introduced in a general manner than
 from any association with potatoes.

Neiv Points in the Zoology of Neiv Guinea. By Prof. Rolleston, F.R.S.

The author commenced by saying that the zoology of New Guinea has had a

great deal of research bestowed upon it, and will yet have a great deal more, as a
Aconsequence of the profit which has already resulted.
                                                        point which recent

zoological discoveries in New Guinea throw light upon is, that there was a dry

land passage at one time between Australia and New Guinea, recent discoveries

in the latter country having revealed the presence there of animals similar to, or

identical with, some found in Australia. This is held as proof that where Torres

Strait now is there was once dry land. But against this hypothesis is urged the

difference between the vegetation of the two islands. This, however, is accounted

for by what Herbert Spencer calls the circumambient medium. Though people

are inclined to think vegetables considerably less sensitive than animals, sometimes

they are more sensitive to heat and dryness ; and the author believes that it is the

greater tenderness of the vegetation in those countries which accounts for the

disparity observable between the vegetable growths of New Guinea and those of
Australia. In the centre of New Guinea there is a high range of mountains, which

attract and impart moisture to the surrounding country ; while the interior of

Australia consists of great barren plains, which harbour no moisture. The plants,
as they have not had the means to protect themselves available to animals, have

Agradually altered their form to accommodate themselves to circumstances.

curious creature, covered with prickles, living on ants and other insects, and

unprovided with means of militant operations, is found on both sides of the Straits.

Two kinds of Echidna have also been discovered in New Guinea, and corresponding

with them is one in Tasmania and another in Australia. These creatures could

not travel over water, and so there must have been land communication at the

period of their original distribution. Quite lately an Echidna has been found in

the south-west corner of New Guinea, and sent to Professor Rolleston by the

Rev. Mr. Lawes, the discoverer, accompanied by a letter, in which the statement is
made that this is the first ever found. For this species the name Echidna lawesi
is proposed. The Cassowary has also been found on both sides of Torres Straits.

Proof of the existence of the Tree-Kangaroo, both in Australia and New Guinea,

Professor Rolleston also considered reliable. At its conclusion the paper treated

of the Admiralty-Island pig, in the fore part of which Professor Rolleston pointed

out the peculiarity of a glabella.

Specimens of Philongria rosea exhibited. By J. B. Rowe, F.L.S.

Much of the interest attaching to thi3 minute Crustacean was due to the fact

that hitherto it has been captured in one locality only in England, and in an area,

of only a few yards.  It  was  first found by Mr. Spence Bate  in Plymouth                                                     but
                                                                                                                            ;

specimens were soon after discovered by Mr. Rowe in a garden at the back of his

house, and four of these organisms were captured on a fern by him on the previous

Sunday, three of which he exhibited. His observations confirm the remarks of

Messrs. Bate and Westwood about the insect.

   The author illustrated his paper by means of a map of the district of which he
treated, and specimens of many of the plants referred to. The author had

endeavoured to identify the roses flourishing within a radius of twelve miles of
Plymouth with those species and varieties classified by Mr. Baker. This involved

extensive research, both on the Continent and at home ; and, among others, M.
DCs6glise, of Geneva, one of the first authorities on the genus, had rendered him
valuable assistance. From his inquiries, he found it advisable to divide the area
over which he extended his observations into six districts, four in South Devon and
two in Cornwall, viz. the Erme, Yealm, Plyni, Tavy and S.E. Tamar, S.W. Tamar,
and Notter, Tiddy, and Seaton districts. The result of the investigations was the

discovery of the following varieties of indigenous Roses : spinosissima ; tomentosa
(Sm.), tomentosa (type form), tomentosa subglobosa, tomentosa scabriuscida, tomentosa
sylvestris; rubiginosa; micrantha, micrantha pedunculo nuda ; canina hdctiana,

   Notes on Anticipatory Inheritance in Plants, especially with reference to the

               Embryology of Parasites. By GL S. Boulgeb, F.L.S.

   The paper was designed to call attention to three groups of facts : first, facts
relating to the embryology of parasites, epiphytes, saprophytes, and carnivorous
plants. These were shown to agree in having fleshy perisperm, and mostly to have
reduced cotyledons. The cotyledons are absent in some, but not all, leafless
parasites and saprophytes ; and the latter class of plants, on the whole, have the
most reduced type of embryo. Secondly, facts relating to the form of the young
and mature leaves in Tropccolum and Aucuba japonica, and in seedlings of the
latter species, which suggest that immature and seedling leaves indicate an ancestral
type now abandoned by the plants in favour of more recently acquired forms.

Thirdly, facts as resemblances of detail between the floral organs of certain plants

and their leaves, under which head especial reference was made to Sarracenia,
Hypericum, and Dionma. These three groups of facts are considered by the
author to exemplify the accumulated effect of a tendency, described by Mr. Darwin

as sometimes seen, viz. that at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it
tends to reappear in the offspring at a somewhat earlier age (Origin of Species,

chap. i. p. 10, in Gth edition). For this accumulated effect the name " anticipatory

inheritance " is used.

      On the Classification of the Vegetable Kingdom. By Prof. M'Nab.

   The proposed classification is a modification of that of Sachs and Prantl, and
most closely follows that recently published by Luersseu. The vegetable kingdom
is divided into 4 subkingdoms, Thallophyta, Bryophyta, rteridophyta, and Pha-

nerogamia, each including certain classes, in all 12 in number. These 12 classes
are subdivided into orders, numbered from 1 to 82 in ascending series, the orders
being still further subdivided into families, corresponding to the natural orders
of British botanists. In each order a selected series of families was given, the
attention of the student being thus directed most prominently to the larger groups
instead of to the more specialized families. In the flowering plants the group of
the Apetalffi was abolished, as suggested by Luerssen, and the families distributed

among the Polypetalous orders.

       The Classification of Flovjering Plants considered PhytogeneiicaUy.

                                     By Prof. M'Nab.

   Haeckel's monophyletic pedigree of the vegetable kingdom, as given in his
'History of Creation,' vol. ii. (English edition), was discussed, and objections to

its conclusions urged. Thus in two cases the groups are known to occur earlier
thanHaeckel'stheory requires; in another case (Monochlamydeous Dicotyledons) the
plants do not appear until much later (in the Cretaceous instead of in the Triassic).
The geological distribution of the Dicotyledonous flowering plants, founded on
Schimper's ' Paleontologie Vegetale,' was then fully discussed. The general con-

--clusion drawn was the following : 1st. That the Gamopetalse are more recent

than the Choripetalce. 2nd. That the apetalous orders must be looked upon, not
as forming a separate group, but as being the lowest members of the subordinate
groups of the Choripetala3. 3rd. That the older representatives in the Chalk of
the larger group generally belong to families having variable characters, more
especially in regard to the number of the parts of the flower. Thus the oldest

               mOn the Movements of Water Plants. By Prof. M'Nab.

   In some experiments published some time ago by the Royal Irish Academy, a
rapidity of ascent of water in the xylum of the stem of the'Cherry Laurel, equal
to 40 inches per hour, was observed. Since the publication of those experiments,
numerous other experiments have been performed by Professor Pfitzer of Heidel-
berg, with the view of ascertaining the velocity of ascent of fluid in plants.

Pfitzer first experimented by observing how soon leaves that had become flaccid
from want of water reassumed their normal position. He also tried the lithium-

citrate method, and in a third series combined the two, using the one method as a
check on the other. In his experiments with lithium citrate, Pfitzer has observed

the greatest rapidity of ascent yet recorded, the Helianthus animus being found
to give a velocity equal to 22 metres per hour, or 15 inches per minute. Professor

Pfitzer also describes a new method to supersede lithium and the spectroscope,
and suggested to him by Professor Kohne, namely, a solution of soluble indigo-
carmine (4 parts to 1000 of water). Experiments made with this solution have

been perfectly successful.

   Hoehnel, in his recently published dissertation, ' Ueber den negativen Druck
der Gefassluft,' has shown that the air in the vessels of the xylum of rapidly
transpiring shoots is in a state of diminished tension ; and when such a shoot is cut
under mercury, the mercury will rise in the stem from 20-38 centimetres in a few
seconds. From his experiments he concluded that the diminution of the tension
of the air in different plants was as follows :

               Quercuspedunculat.a .... 24-5 centimetres of mercury.

From this it is evident that an important source of error may be introduced into

all experiments with lithium or coloured solution or cut shoots, as this abnormal

current, as Pfitzer calls it, may be more rapid than the normal. Experiment,

however, shows that the normal current is more rapid than the abnormal, due to

the diminished tension of the air in the vessels, hence no error has been introduced

into the experiments from this cause.

        On an abnormal Plant of Primula veris. By Professor M'jSab.

  A plant of Primula veris was picked in a field on the east side of the Hill of

Howth, co. Dublin, in April 1877, having in the axil of one of the older and
outer leaves a single flower of Primula vulgaris. The plant had the leaves of tho
Cowslip, as well as two umbels of flowers of P. veris, both arising from the axils
of the younger or inner leaves. One of the umbels had the flowers expanded, the
other had_ only small buds. The single primrose flower was in all respects normal,
and both it and the cowslip flowers were macrostylous. In the field along with
the abnormal plant both P. veris and P. vulgaris were common, as well as occasional
plants of evident hybrid origin. The abnormal plant exhibited was probably a
hybrid showing the return to the parent forms, much in the same manner as the
well-known Cytisus Adami. Mr. Darwin, in his last book on the forms of flowers,

mentions the occurrence of such a form as that here described in cidtivated hybrids

between the cowslip and primrose. It is therefore a matter of much interest to
find that similar forms may be produced in a wild state.

 On tlie Fossil Flora of tlie Arctic Regions ; an Extract from a Letter from
    Prof. Heer to Sir Joseph Hooker, K.C.S.I., F.B.S. Communicated by the
   Eov. W. S. Symonds.

    This was an extract from a letter from Professor Heer to Sir Joseph Hooker, and
gave data relative to the flora found in extremely high latitudes.

   On the recent occurrence of Lavatera sylvestris, Brot., in the Scilly Islands.
                           By Henry Tkimen, MM., F.L.S.

    This Mallow was collected first in July 1873 by Mr. Curnow of Penzance, on tho
Island of St. Mary, and again in 1876. During the past summer it was found in
abundance in the islands of St. Agnes and Tresco.

  --The exotic range of the species Portugal, Madeira, Azores, Canaries, and Mo-
--gador shows it to belong to that small, but interesting type of distribution to

which the name " Atlantic " may be fitly applied. Of this type the western counties

of England already possess several examples, e. g. Arihrolobrium ebracteatum,
Erica vayans and E. ciliaris, Trifolium strictum, T. Bocconi, and T. Molinerii,
Hypericum bcsticum and H. linarifolium, Physospennum comubiense, liume.v ru-
pestris, and Lobelia arem. The term " Atlantic" was employed by Mr. H. C. Wat-
son to indicate those and other species also which are confined in a similar way to

the west of England. Many of these latter, however, do not in their exotic dis-

tribution exhibit the same strictly Atlantic distribution, but occur also in Central,
 Southern, or even Eastern Europe.

    Lavatera sylvestris, though thus agreeing with the true Atlantic type in its
distribution, cannot, however, be considered native in Scilly (as was supposed by

--its discoverer there) for the following reasons: (1) It was not seen there in 1863

by Mi*. Townsend, a careful botanist, who published a list of the flora of the
group. (2) In the original station in St. Mary's it grows in company with Reseda

fruticidosu, and looks clearly an introduction, in the opinion of Mr. T. R. A. Briggs.
(3) It appears to have spread very rapidly, a characteristic of several Malvaceae,
e.g. Malva borecdis, Wallm., near Plymouth, and Lavatera cretica, L. (a close ally

Aof L. sylvestris), in several points of the coast of Western France. (4) few spe-

cimens have occurred near Penzance, on the mainland of Cornwall, under circum-
stances clearly showing it to be a mere casual introduction.

                 The Structure and Development of the Vertebrate Skull.

                             By G. T. Bettany, M.A., B.Sc,

    This paper gives an account of conclusions to be published in an immediately

forthcoming work on the ' Morphology of the Skull,' by Prof. W. K. Parker,

F.R.S., and G. T. Bettany. The trabecule are believed to be structures of the
 same order as the parachordal and basilar cartilages of the skull, and to be similar
 to the lower parts and base of neural arches in the vertebral column. The skull
becomes a more or less continuous neural tube of cartilage, with new perforations
 at intervals, and a series of sense-capsules embedded in it laterally. The only
 part of the craniuni answering to the main part of the vertebral centra is a slender
 tube of tissue surrounding the notochord, which becomes separately ossified in some

forms after the manner of vertebral centra ; and there are indications of three of
these all becoming either fused into the basioccipital bone or absorbed. The basilar
or postpituitary region of the skull corresponds to not fewer than four body-seg-
ments, and possibly represents a considerably larger number. The osseous skull
supplies no data for fixing the total number of body-segments that have gone to
make up the skull. The segments discernible in the skulls of Mammalia do not
enable us to lay out the composition of lower skulls on that plan. The mammalian
skull is the culmination of an evolution, not the simple type to which all skulls are

to be referred. Many bones of the mammalian skull are modifications of bones

which primarily are scales and dermal bones in lower vertebrates, and have no
original relation to deep parts, and cannot receive names expressing vertebral

relations.

                  On the use of the terms Assimilation and Metastasis.

                          ByG. T. Bettany, M.A., B.Sc.

   This paper urged the bringing about of a close unity between animal and vege-
table physiology by the use of terms in the same sense, and the expression of
processes in the same manner and wherever possible. The term assimilation is

now used in a total different manner in the two, and physiology is retarded thereby.
The manufacture of protoplasm out of food by pre-existing protoplasm is the
legitimate use of the term assimilation. It is much better to use other words for

other processes. " Chlorophyll-function " is an expression deserving of introduc-

tion. " Metastasis," or Stofiswechsel, as used by Sachs, covers much too wide an

area ; it should be restricted to changes occurring in order to the transport of
materials, and distinguished from assimilation.

On the Mammillary and Accessory Processes as Persistent Epiphyses in tJie

   Human Spine. By ~D. J. Cunningham, M.D., Senior Demonstrator of

    Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.

   The author showed a vertebral column which he had obtained in the dissecting-
rooms of the Edinburgh University, and called the attention of the Department to
the following peculiarities which it exhibited. (1) Twelfth dorsal vertebra : the
mammillary processes were present as separate nodules of bone quite distinct from
the vertebra. (2) First Lumbar Vertebra: the mammillary and accessory pro-
cesses were fused and constituted on each side of the neural arch a V-shaped ossicle
in opposition with but not attached by osseous union to the vertebra. (3) The
tip of the spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra and the tip of the transverse
process of the seventh dorsal vertebra were also present in the form of ossicles,
unconnected by osseous union with the basal portion of the process.

   In the recent state all these ossicles were jointed to their respective vertebrae by

true diarthrodial joints.

On the Myology of the Shoulder and Upper Arm of the Thylacme, Cuscus,
   and Phascogalo. By D. J. Cunningham, M.D., Senior Demonstrator of

    Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.

   Towards the close of last Winter Session I was so fortunate as to obtain, for the
purpose of anatomical research, all the marsupial animals brought home by the

* Challenger Expedition.' In the present instance I purpose confining my remarks

entirely to the anatomy of the shoulder and upper arm of three of the least-knc

of these specimens, viz. the Thylacinus c/noccphalus, the Phalanyista maculuta or
Cuscus, and the Pkascoyale calura.

  --Trapezius. This muscle, which springs from the occipital crest, the spines of all
108 REPORT--] 877.

the cervical vertebras, and the spines of the seven anterior dorsal vertehra3, has a
somewhat complicated insertion. The posterior and greater part is inserted into
the scapular spine ; the anterior portion sweeps over the head of the humerus and
the clavicle, and is inserted differently in each of the three animals. In the Cuscus

--a very few of the fibres those constituting the anterior free margin of the muscle
--are attached to the clavicle ; the others pass down and fuse with the acromial

and clavicular portions of the deltoid. In the Phascogale the insertion of this por-

tion of the trapezius is precisely similar, with the exception that none of its fibres

enter the acromial deltoid, all join the clavicular part of that muscle. In the

Thylacme the humeral division of the trapezius passes over the rudimentary clavicle,

and some of its fibres mixing with the muscles attached to that bone, it ends

entirely in the clavicular deltoid.

   Acromio-trachelien (the omo-atlantic of Professors Haughton and Macalister).

In the Cuscus and Phascof/ale this muscle is double ; in the Thylaeme it is single.
   In the Cuscus and Phascogale the muscle consists of two distinct fleshy bands,

which from their position ruay be called the acromio-trachelien superior and the

acromio-trachelien inferior. In both cases they arise from the transverse process

of the altas, but in the Cuscus the upper muscle derives an additional slip from the
transverse process of the axis. They are inserted into the acromion process and
spine of the scapula. In the Cuscus the two muscles fuse at their insertion, and

occupy the whole length of the scapular spine. In the Phascogale they are separate

throughout, but the upper muscle fuses near its insertion with the rhomboid

muscle.

In the Thglac.ine the muscle is single. It arises from the transverse process of

the altas, and is inserted into the lower half of the scapular spine and into the

--posterior border of the acromion process.
    Ckido-oceipital. This muscle is present both in the Cuscus and Phascogale, but

it is absent in the Thylacinc.

   It is a very narrow slip of muscle in the Cuscus, and being closely applied to the

upper margin of the cleido-mastoid it is not at first apparent. Posteriorly it is

unattached to the sternal end of the clavicle in close apposition with the origin of

the cleido-mastoid                                                                                     anteriorly it is attached to the occipital ridge at the same level,
                                                                                                    ;

and between the stemo-mastoid and trapezius.

   In the Phascogale it is a well-marked muscle, distinct and separate from the
cleido-mastoid throughout its whole extent. Its attachments are the same as in

the Cuscus, but as it approaches the occiput it fuses with the anterior margin of the

--trapezius.
   Subclavius. In the Cuscus and Phascogale this muscle presents nothing worthy

of special notice. In both it is very strongly developed, and in both it arises from

the cartilage of the first rib, and expanding is inserted into the outer half of the

clavicle by fleshy fibres. In neither dors it extend beyond the outer end of the

clavicle towards the acromion process or supraspinatus fascia.

WeIn the Thylacinc it has the same origin but a very different insertion.                              trace

it to the supraspinatus fascia, and through the medium of this it is inserted into

the spine of the scapula.

 --Deltoid. In the Cuscus the scapular and the clavicular portions of this muscle

are separate above, but they are united at their insertion into the humerus. The
former is much the larger of the two. It arises from the acromion process, from

the entire length of the scapular spine, and from the fascia covering the infraspinatus

muscle. As the acromial fibres pass downwards they are reinforced by those fibres
of the trapezius which in man are inserted into the acromion process. The

clavicular portion of the muscle arises from the middle third of the clavicle, and it

receives those fibres of the trapezius which in man are attached to the clavicle.
The two portions of the deltoid, thus reinforced, converge as they proceed down-

wards, and fusing with each other, and to a certain extent also with the lower part

of the pectoralis major at its insertion, they are inserted into a well-marked deltoid

impression on the upper and outer aspect of the shaft of the humerus.
   In the Phascogale the deltoid is broken up into three distinct factors, quite

separate from each other except at their insertion. This triple constitution of the

muscle is due to the acromial fibres passing down as a narrow band, apart from
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        109

tlio fibres which take origin from the spine of the scapula. The humeral portion

of the trapezius joins the clavicular part, and the muscle has the same insertion as

in the Cuscus.

In the Thylaoine the deltoid is in two parts, a scapular and a clavicular, and

these are separate from each other, both at their origin and insertion. The scapu-

lar deltoid is much the more extensive of the two. Its origin is the same as in

the Ciischs. It is inserted into the outer aspect of the humerus, distinct from, and

at a higher level than, the clavicular deltoid. The clavicular deltoid derives iibres

from three distinct sources. The chief proportion is derived from the trapezius

and cleido-mastoid muscle, but it also receives some which spring directly from

the rudimentary clavicle. This portion of the deltoid is inserted into the outer

aspect of the shaft of the humerus at a lower level than the preceding.

We are now in a position to understand the constitution of the compound muscle

Weknown in comparative anatomy as the cephalo-humeral muscle.           have already

studied its component parts.

In the Cuschs it consists of that portion of the trapezius which in man is inserted

into the acromion and clavicle, joined with the acromial and clavicular parts of the

deltoid. In the Thylacine and Phaseoyale, on the other hand, the acromial deltoid

is not a constituent. In the former it is composed of the cleido-mastoid, the

anterior fibres of the trapezius, and the clavicular deltoid ; in the latter by the

--anterior fibres of the trapezius and the clavicular deltoid.
   Teres minor. This muscle is very short, but present in them all, and quite dis-

tinct from the infraspinatus.

  --Triceps. In the Thylacine the origin of the long head is remarkable for its great

extent. This portion of the muscle arises from nearly the whole length of the

axillary border of the scapula. But all the fibres springing from this do not reach

-- Adown to the olecranon. They consist of two sets : (1)  set arising from the

scapula, close to the glenoid cavity, and running down in the form of a thick round

fleshy muscle, which, as it approaches the elbow, blends with the other two heads

Aof the triceps. (2) set springing from the axillary border of the scapula, posterior

to this, which constitutes a thin fleshy mass composed of short fibres. These short

fibres curve forward, and are lost amongst those which spring from the scapula

close to the glenoid cavity.

  --Coraco-brachialis. Professor Wood, of King's College, London, in his very able

paper upon " Muscular Variation " (Journ. of Anat. and Phys. vol. i.), has taught

us to look upon the typical coraco-brachialis as being a muscle with a triple con-

stitution. The animals in question afford a beautiful example of this.

In all three the coraco-brachialis superior is found, whilst in addition the median

--variety is present in the Phaseoyale, and the long variety in the Citscus.
   Latissimus dorsi. In the Cuscus and Phascogale the insertion of this muscle is

the same ; in the Thylacine it is somewhat different. In all it is more or less con-

nected with that of the teres major.

In the Cuscus and Phaseoyale the latissimus, as it approaches the humerus,

divides into two parts. Of these the upper and smaller slip, which corresponds to

the superior margin of the muscle, passes behind the other part and, joining the

lower margin of the teres major, is inserted into the inner lip of the bicipital

groove. The lower and main portion of the muscle ends in a strong tendinous band,

which is attached to the bottom of the bicipital groove, separated by a wide

interval from the insertion of the teres major.

   In the Thylacine the teres major and latissimus dorsi have a common insertion
into the humerus, and chiefly through the medium of a strong tendinous band,

which arches backwards from the bottom of the bicipital groove, where it is firmly

fixed to the humerus. This band is twisted upon itself so that its lower margin

has a round and cord-like appearance. Into its anterior half are inserted tho

greater proportion of the fibres of the -teres major, only a small portion of this

muscle being directly attached to the bone, and into its posterior half the latissimus

dorsi is inserted.

The dorsi cpitrochlear muscle is present in them all.
--Pectoral muscles. These muscles have a very complicated arrangement.

                                 ;

which, according to Professor Macalister, is tbe representative of the pectoralis

minor ; and (4) a pectoralis quartus.
   Of tbese the first two are simply constituent parts of tbe great pectoral muscle.

Together tbey represent tbe pectorabs major. Tbe superficial part arises from tbe

whole length of the sternum and ensiform cartilage, and is inserted into the outer
lip of the bicipital groove, fusing sbgbtly -with the clavicular deltoid. The deep
part of the pectorabs major arises from the anterior third of the sternum, and is
quite separate throughout its whole extent from tbe preceding muscle. Stretching

outwards as a thick fleshy band, it is inserted into the external tuberosity and

outer bicipital ridge.

   Tbe pectoralis minor arises from the posterior two thirds of the sternum, ex-

cluding the ensiform cartilage, and also from one or two of the costal cartilages.
From this it extends outwards and forwards under the deep portion of the pectora-

lis major, and it is inserted into the inner margin of tbe great tuberosity of the
humerus, and through the medium of fascia into the tendon of the supraspinatus

muscle and the coracoid process.

Tbe pectoralis quartus (of Macalister) arises from tbe linea alba and from the

fascia over the rectus behind the ensiform cartilage, and it proceeds forwards under

cover of the superficial pectoral muscle to its insertion into tbe upper part of the

--pectoral ridge.
   Phascogale. Tbe pectoral muscles are identical with those of tbe discus with

two exceptions, viz. (1) there is no deep muscle corresponding with the deep part

of the pectoralis major                                                                                       (2) tbe  pectoralis quartus is better developed and more in

tbe form of a fleshy band.

In the Tliylacine the pectoral muscles are reduced to a superficial and a deep

muscle and a very rudimentary pectoralis quartus.
   The superficial muscle is the representative of the pectorabs major, and arises

from that part of tbe sternum which lies anterior to the second costal cartilage.
   The deep pectoral, which represents that muscle to which in the Cuscus we

have given the name of pectoralis minor, arises from the whole length of the ster-

num behind tbe origin of the preceding muscle, and also from some of the posterior

costal cartilages.

   The pectoralis major is inserted into the pectoral ridge at a lower level than the
pectoralis minor, which is inserted into tbe outer tuberosity of tbe humerus and

into the tendon of the supraspinatus.

   Tbe pectorabs quartus is represented by tbe minute slips of muscle wbich end

on the under surface of the pectoralis major.

     On the Brachial Plexus of the Cuscus. By D. J. Cunningham, M.D.,

              Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.

   In tbe Cuscus the brachial plexus is formed by the anterior divisions of tbe 5th,
Gth, 7th, and 8th cervical nerves, together with tbe anterior division of the 1st
dorsal nerve. Tbese enter tbe axilla as from cords, tbe 5th and Gth cervical nerves
having previously effected a junction. Here they all unite to form a short flattened

--nervous band, which bes between the axillary artery and vein.
   Branches. The branches of tbe brachial nerves may be divided into two sets:

1, those which spring from the cords before they enter the flattened band or
plexus ; 2, those which arise directly from the plexus.

   Under the first heading we have the suprascapular nerve, the subscapular nerves,

tbe musculo-spiral nerve, and the circumflex nerve.
   Of these the circumflex alone deserves special notice, and this on account of the

large size and extensive distribution of its cutaneous branch. Under cover of the
deltoid muscle it divides into two divisions of equal size ; of these, one suppbes tbe
deltoid and teres minor, whilst the other becomes superficial and gives branches not
only to tbe skin on tbe outer aspect of the upper arm, but also to tbe skin on tbe

outer aspect of the forearm. It apparently talies the place of the cutaneous portion
of the nerve which corresponds to the musculocutaneous in man.

   The branches arising directly from the plexus are tbe median, musculocutaneous,

   The median nerve, accompanied by the brachial artery and vein, passes through
a large supracondyloid foramen. The same arrangement is found in the Thylacine
and Phascogale.

   The musculo-cutaneous nerve appears to be a purely motor nerve. It is distri-
buted to tho biceps, coraco-brachialis, aud brachialis anticus.

                 Researches on the Life-history of the Simplest Organisms.

                            By the Rev. W. H. Dallingee.

   The author stated that he had worked out the life-histories of six Monads, and
then proceeded to give the results of numerous experiments in connexion with the
same. Motion was, perhaps, nowhere so universal as in the most minute forms of
life, and here it was that we often found movement of the most graceful kind. It
had now been made quite certain that the degrees of ease and force of motion of
these animals depended upon the number of their flagella, which, so far as investi-
gation had yet gone, ranged from one to four. With regard to the most minute

forms of life, the author considers that the study of their life-histories shows that
these forms were perfectly complete and definite ; there was no mutation nor any
thing unnatural. The results of his experiments with certain life-germs showed
that when ordinary air was charged with given germs, any nutritive fluid receiving
these germs would produce monads, while when the air was kept perfectly pure

the same fluid would not produce a single monad. With the air at a temperature
of 310° Fahrenheit and charged with germs, the fluid produced no monads. The

author stated that he is a perfect convert to the theory of the " survival of the

fittest." At a temperature of 46° the six monads with which he had been experi-
menting were found to live and flourish, and they covdd bear a sudden increase of
temperature up to 60° without exhibiting any signs of inconvenience ; but if, upon
reaching this point, the temperature was suddenly increased by five degrees, the
monads showed a faintness. The temperature might, however, by a slow process
be increased to 127° degrees, in which the monads would live, and multiply even
more rapidly than in a temperature of 45°. The results of similar experiments
also seemed to show that it took a much longer time to produce a modification in
the ovum than to produce a modification in the parent.

wOn Transcendental Anatomy, a Geometrical Investigation of the best possible

  number of Limbs for Terrestrial and Aquatic Animals. By the Rev. Pro-

   fessor Hatjghton, F.R.S.

Treating of the swimming powers of the numerous members of the Naiad family,

the author explains their various abilities of exercising muscular and fibrous force

in different directions. The two-limbed Naiad is, he considers, related to our pre-

sent Rays and Skates, whilst the three-limbed Naiad finds close representatives in

some of the fossil fishes. Odd-limbed Naiads all possess advantages over the even-
Alimbed ones.

Medusa is, in spite of its sluggish disposition, perhaps the most beautiful of swim-

ming animals. The system of vortex rings (the form of force which passes through

water with the least resistance) produced by these creatures in swimming is the

secret of their easy locomotion.

Photograplis of Representations of Vascular Injection by Prof. Dantscher, of

                 'Innsbruck. By Dr. Allen Thomson, F.B.S.

   The author brought under the notice of the Section the approaching publication
of a series of photographic representations of the minute distribution of blood-
vessels in a number of the organs of the animal body, made under the superinten-
dence of Prof. Dantscher, of the University of Innsbruck, from injected and corroded
preparations made by himself. Dr. Thomson saw some of these preparations some
years ago at Innsbruck, and admired them much.

   The collection has since been much increased, and the photographs executed

partly on paper and partly on glass : and some of them, coloured after the original
preparations, are capable of being viewed with the stereoscope so as to give a most
truthful and instructive view of the beautiful structures they represent.

   Dr. Thomson regretted that accidental circumstances had made it impossible to
show some of these photographs to the Section. They are all to be presented to
the Meeting of German naturalists at Munich in September, and the work will be
dedicated to the University of Tubingen on the occasion of the four-hundredth anni-
versary of its foundation, which was held in the past month of July.

On Flint Flalces from Cormvall and the Stilly Isles. By Dr. Baeham.

Prehistoric Remains on Dartmoor. By C. Spence Bate, F.R.S.

The author made some remarks on the prehistoric remains near the Plym.

The remains were unique in their character. He exhibited a diagram of the

remains lying within two branches of the Plym, bounded on the upperside by

Aylesbury and Higher and Lower Hartor, which were, he said, typical of all the

other remains on Dartmoor. They consisted of lines of stones, about a pace apart,

and of different lengths, terminating with a stone circle at one end and with a " kist

vaen " at the other. The kist vaen was a stone box, two feet broad, four feet long,

and about two feet four inches deep. In the one investigated the cap-stone was still

there, and in a most perfect condition. Near it was a cairn or stone heap, not a

barrow, which was distinguished from a cairn by being an earth heap. He had

opened one or two of these cairns on Hamel Down some time ago. In one he found

the remains of some burnt human bones, a single stone, and near them a single flint

implement, a very fine Hake, which might be supposed to make a useful flint hat-

Achet.  second barrow near differed very little from the first. There were, however,

a number of stones lying flat : beneath them he found a little ornamental article

composed of amber inlaid with gold ; its margin was broken, and it had little gold

rivets put around the sides. Close by he found a little bronze blade of a dagger,

--and he ultimately conceived that the two articles were originally connected that

one was, in fact/the blade and the other the handle of a complete dagger. They

were evidently not of British type. Mr. Franks had confirmed him in the idea

that they were of the Neolithic period, just as flint was passing into bronze, and

were probably Scandinavian in their character. On the banks of these little rivers

they found the remains of tin-works to an enormous amount. He did not say they

all belonged  to  pre  1   istoric  times  ;  for in the  days  of Elizabeth, when  Sir  "Walter
                        ,

Kaleigh was Lord Warden of the Stannaries, he held his court in this district.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  115

With regard to the cairns and the paraleliltra, Mr. Bate stated that Mr. Ferguson's
theory was that they occupied the positions of two opposing armies. The author
thought there might have been battles between the Scandinavians and the
Devonshire tinners. As they found several east Tors and no west Tors, he sug-
gested that they probably marked the position of the " Eastmen," in this case
Scandinavians. With respect to the paraleliltra, his theory was that the greatest
man who fell in the battle was interred in the paraleliltra, and the general mass

in the neighbouring cairn.

                   The Bulgarians. By J. Bedboe, M.D., F.B.S.

   The author said that the races of Turkey were separated by national anti-
pathies and linguistic difficulties, and yet it was difficult to separate them, because
the boundaries of race in Turkey were very undefined. The true Slavs had ex-
tended themselves over a pretty large area in Asia, and maintained the same
characteristics. The Bulgarians, however, though they spoke Sclavonic, were a
dift'erent race altogether, and, strange to say, they had little or no Turanian element
in them. The original Bulgarians were a tribe from the north-east, from the Volga

region, where probably they were connected with the Huns and Avars, with whom

they appeared to have much in common, and who had been considered of mixed
Turkish or Finnish blood. By the kindness of Dr. Barnard Davis, who placed his
rich collection at his service, the author was able to see and measure a Bulgarian
skull and the cast of another, and to compare them with divers Sclavish, Turkish,
and other skulls. The cranium had the following characteristics, all of which were

--considered by Copernicki to belong to the type : Cylindrical form, moderate

breadth, frontal region sloping away rapidly above, and to some extent also late-

rally; absence of frontal and parietal bones, large occipital region, comparative
elevation of posterior part of skull, not one of which points were Sclavonic. The

narrowness of the forehead permitted the zygomata to be visible when looked at
from above. The nasal notch was deep, and the nose might have been well formed.
The face was evidently prognathous, and sufficiently so to distinguish it from a
Kussinack, Slavack-Czech, or Civat skull. The deformity of the nose, which
attained portentious proportions, occurred in a less degree among nearly pure
Sclavs, such as the Poles. The skull form, however, must be traced in the main

either to the pre-Bulgar inhabitants of Mcesia and Thrace, or to the true original
Bulgar. The author fell back upon the latter. His conjecture was that the type

was Ugrian, and that the modern Bulgarians were at least as much Ugrian as any
thing else. They differed from the Serbs in some points favourably, but in more,
perhaps, unfavourably. They were not, however, mere embodiments of force, but

were both industrious and ambitious, with a desire of knowledge and a capacity to
learn, and under more favourable circumstances better things, perhaps, might be

expected.

  Ethnological Hints afforded by tlie Stimulants of the Ancient and Modem
                        Savages. By Miss A. W. Buckland.

   The study of primitive agriculture, which formed the subject of the memoir read
by the author before the Association last year, led naturally to that of the stimu-
lants adopted by ditlerent races, because it was found that from a very early period
in the history ot mankind some sort of stimulant had been used almost universally.

Among the lowest races this consisted now, as in ages past, only of some root or

leaf chewed for its strengthening and invigoi-ating properties, such as the Pitberry,
recently discovered in use among nations in Central Australia, and the cocoa-leaf
among the Indians of South America ; but no sooner did the nations advance to
the agricultural stage than they began to make fermented drinks from the roots of
grains cultivated for food. Hence the beer of Egypt, which probably found its

                                                                                                    9*

way with the wheat and barley of that land to the Swiss lake-dwellings and over
a great part of Europe, having been evidently known in Greece and Rome at a very

early period, whilst a similar liquor still formed the chief beverage of all African
nations, being now, as formerly in Egypt, fermented by means of plants. In China

and Japan rice was and is used to make wine or beer instead of wheat or barley or
American maize. In Bolivia this is chewed to produce fermentation, like the
M kava " of the South-Sea Islands, a practice which reappears among the in-
habitants of Formosa, who use rice instead of maize. The sour milk or " kournis "
of the pastoral tribes of Central Asia, and the mead of the ancient Scandinavians,
both reappear among the Kaffirs of South Africa. Palm wine was used wherever
palms flourished; but wine of the juice of the grape, although known in very
ancient times, seemed to have been confined to the civilized races of Western Asia
and Egypt, extending later to Greece and Rome. The multitude of wines described
by Pliny were, however, in almost all cases flavoured with herbs or garden plants
for medicinal purposes. The conclusions to be drawn from the history of fer-
mented beverages, as recorded by travellers, were that the earliest stimidants were
simply leaves and roots chosen by animal instinct, chew7ed, and found by expe-
rience to produce exhilaration and strength. With the dawn of civilization, these
roots and plants, still chewed, were mixed with water, and thus a kind of fer-
mentation was induced, producing a mildly intoxicating drrnk; and when the
agricultural stage was attained the cereals took the place of the earlier roots and
leaves, and were also probably at first chewed to produce fermentation, as still in
Formosa and South America, to be superseded in a higher degree of civilization
with the use of the grape. Yet even in this, as in the liquors made from grain, the
roots and plants of an earlier age were retained for flavour and to produce fer-

mentation: and even the form and material of the earlier drinking-cups were
retained in civilized countries skilled in the manufactory, whilst the originally

medicinal character of these beverages gave rise to many superstitions, to the

 deification of plants and their dedication to various gods, to the birth of gods of
wine, as well as to the universal custom of commencing every orgie with libations
to the gods and of proposing healths at feasts. The art of distillation, though
 probably known early in the Christian era, is comparatively modern, and was
 certainly imknown to savage races until " fire-water " was introduced, to their
 serious detriment, by Europeans.

               On some Paleeolithic Implements found in the Axe Valley.
                                By J. Evans, D.C.L., F.B.S.

    The author called attention to the discovery of palaeolithic implements in the
 valley of the Axe, a considerable collection of which had been obtained for the Albert
 Memorial Museum of Exeter by its curator. The implements had for the most
 part been found upon the South-western Railway in ballast dug in a pit at Broom,
 between Chard Junction and Axminster. They present the usual forms of palseo-

 lithic implements, though formed of chert from the Black Down beds, and not of

 flint. Though no mammalian nor testaceous remains have as yet been found in the
 gravel, it seems to be of the same age as the other gravels in which such implements
 had been found. Though the number of implements collected was large, they are
 by no means common. The author exhibited a large, but somewhat rude specimen.
 The discovery of these implements proved that where chalk flints were scarce other
 siliceous rocks were utilized by Palaeolithic men for the same purpose.

   On some Saxon and British Tumidi near Guildford. By Col. Lane Fox.

     The author considered that in one of the tumuli the central interment, whether
 burnt or otherwise, must have been placed on the surface of the ground, the mound
  raised above it ; but no trace remained. Near the centre of the mound, however,

 --three British urns were found with burnt bones in them probably, he thought,

 secondary interments, but possibly the original interment for which the mound
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  117

Awas raised. It was evident that this was a British harrow of the bronze age. pecu-

liarity of the mound was that it contained no flakes, showing that the custom of
throwing them into harrows was not universal. In another tumulus, near this one,

the author found no central grave ; but a layer of black coal, probably the result of

fire, was found just beneath the surface ; although in the centre a small hole was
clearly seen, where, no doubt, a burnt body had been deposited. There were a
great number of burnt flints, but no flake or implement of any kind. The author
described six tumuli (sections of which were exhibited) in the same locality. Burnt
bones, an iron Saxon knife, and other remains were found, which led the author

to fix the date of the erection of the tumuli at about 500 or 600 a.d.

     Some Rune-like Characters on Chalk. By J. Park Harbison, M.A.

   The author stated that the characters in question had been found in some chalk

galleries at Cissbury, in Sussex. He said they had all the appearance of early

characters, and had been accepted as such by several eminent palajographists, who,
however, were unable at present to decipher them. They were neither Scandina-

vian nor Saxon. He exhibited a diagram of a Runic inscription found on a granite

block at Smolensk for comparison with the chalk inscriptions.

                   Tlu Ancient 'People and Irrigation-works of Ceylon.

                          By Bertram F. Hartshorne, M.A.

   The author pointed out generally the system of social polity and the high state

of civilization which existed in the island in early ages. The character and desti-

nies of the inhabitants were mainly determined by the influence of the Buddhist
religion, which was introduced into the island in the Gth century before Christ.
About 500 years later the practice of devil-dancing was added to the national reli-

gious observances, with the view of appeasing the malignity of the red-eyed
demon, to whose displeasure was attributed a famine and plague which happened

at that time. So popular was this new custom that one hundred years afterwards
King Budha Daasa ordained that every division of ten villages should have an
astrologer, a devil-dancer, and a preacher attached to it. At the present day
devil-dancing is of very frequent and general occurrence. The early Singalese

people were essentially a martial race, owing to the repeated invasions of the
Solleans from the south of India; but pearl-diving is recorded to have been a
regular occupation among them in the third century B.C. In later times the

social condition of the people is curiously illustrated by the rock inscriptions of

the date of about 1200 a.d. The King Parakrama Bahu I., we are told, thrice

visited all the towns and strongholds of his kingdom, and established such security

everywhere that " even a women might traverse the country with a precious
jewel, and not be asked, What is it?" His Majesty also, "wearing the crown

and decorated with the Royal armaments, caused himself, as well as his chief
queens, his son, and his daughter, to be weighed in a balance every year," and be-
stowed five times their weight of goods upon needy people, and made every one
happy " by causing a constant supply of rain." The great tanks remain as monuments

of the enlightened despotisms of various kings, who raised the country in turn to a
splendid height of prosperity. Some of them belong to periods long before the
Christian era. One, called Kalawewa, was an inland sea, thirty miles in circum-
ference, formed by damming up two rivers by means of an immense embankment

twelve miles long ; another, Padawya, must have occupied a million of people for
ten or fifteen years in its construction. Its bimd, or embankment, is eleven miles

in length, 70 feet high, and 160 feet thick at the base. The bed of the tank is now

overgrown with a magnificent forest, and for miles around there is not a Aestio-e of

man. Its last restoration was effected by King Parakrama Bahu I., and a stone
obelisk on the spot records how he accomplished this work, "in the hope of ob-
taining the happiness of this ns well as the nexl world." King Maha Son, who
--118 REPORT 1877.

reigned about 275 a.d., seems to have done most in the formation of these vast

tanks. It is calculated that one which he formed, named Kanthelai, could only be

constructed at the present clay at a cost of upwards of one million sterling. Under

the vigorous and energetic government of the Eight Hon. Sir William Gregory,

much has been effected in the way of the restoration of many of these tanks" and

with the happiest results. The neglect and apathy of successive generations, both

of rulers and of the people, has been the main cause of the abandonment and deso-

lation of large tracts of lands, whose fertility was formerly indicated by such

names as " The Golden Plains," or "The Granary of the Kings." Foreign and

internal warfare no doubt caused the destruction of some irrigation works, and

their continued disrepair has been mainly owing to the disregard of ancient

customs, and to the abolition of the system of compulsory labour. The population

has simultaneously been seriously diminished by disease, resulting from bad food

and habitual violations of every principle of sanitary economy. The Tank country

in the North of Ceylon has also been afflicted by a terrible scourge, termed the

Parangi disease, or Wanni plague, an hereditary and peculiar malady which seems

to be amenable to no direct treatment. Probably good food and pure water will

ultimately tend to check it more than any thing else; and this happy result would

be_ chiefly due to the comprehensive  scheme of restoration lately                                                 initiated                                         whilst
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

it is tobe hoped that the island, which now requires an annual import of nearly

five million bushels of rice, will before long grow sufficient for its own require-

ments.

              Notes on Socotra. By F. M. Hunter.

The author described the island and its inhabitants. The Bedouins, of the

interior are divided into families, but there are only a few principal tribes. One

tribe, called KiBshim, claims to be descendants of the Portuguese. The Momi, who

reside in the eastern part of the island, are said to be the result of intermarriage

between  the  aborigines  and  Abyssinians                                                 and  the  Camabar, who  occupy Plaj air                                   and
                                                                                        ;

the higher ranges above Tamarida, are supposed to have resulted from mixture of

the aborigines with the Mahri Arabs. The manners and customs of the inhabitants

of Socotra were described in detail. It was observed that the mark of the cross
was still used on the headstones of the graves.

  On tlie proposed Exploration of certain Caves in the neighbourhood of Tenby.
                                        By Ed. Laws.

   In a cave near Tenby, Pembrokeshire, the author found Hyccna crocuta, Ursus
spetous, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Cervus tamndus, Cervus elephas, Equus spelteus,

human bones, the remains of domestic animals, chips of flint, a remarkable horn-
stone, copper pennies of George III., and an old penknife. This cave Mr. Laws
advocates the exploration of. The author minutely detailed the peculiarities of such

of the remains as were of indubitable antiquity, and urged that in the interests of
paleontology further search should be made.

            The DeviVs Arrotvs ( Yorkshire). By A. L. Lewis, M.A.I.

   This name has been given to certain stones standing in aline near Boroughbridge,
of which three now remain out of five known to have existed formerly. Others
may have existed, but the five of which we know would have formed a tolerably
symmetrical monument by themselves. The author, while contending for the pre-
Ilonian origin of most of our rude stone monuments, is disposed to think that
these might commemorate some victory of Scandinavian invaders. The author
also described an easy and ingenious method by which large stones are transported
and erected by some hill-tribes of India.

                  On the District <>f Mycena and its early Occupants.
                                By Dr. J. S. Phene, F.S.A.

   It was explained in this paper that the usual custom adopted by travellers and
historians of describing ancient towns, as those of Mycenaj, Argos, Nauplia, &c,
by the walls and other features peculiar to each, was not sufficiently comprehen-
sive to convey an idea of the condition of society and military power in ancient
times. They were seldom or never referred to by recent historians as parts of a
kingdom, but rather as separate kingdoms ; and their relationship to each other,
except in cases of alliance or hostility, was very seldom hinted at. This was a
partial way of viewing the matter, and conveyed but a small knowledge of those
ancient times to which the Greek poets, as Homer, ^Eschylus, and others, referred.
These historians, if faithfully examined, woidd be found to deal with the question

on a broader base, and one more faithful to facts. Thus Agamemnon was King

of Argos as well as Mycenrc, and his kingdom would be found to have extended
not only over those cities, but also to a great part of Corinth, while Menelaus, his
brother, governed a large portion of the territory of the Peloponnesus. The object
of drawing attention to these points was to account for the number of minor Cyclo-
pean works which are to be found on a careful inspection around the Argolic dis-
trict, and which can only be accounted for by supposing they were used as out-
works or garrison towns by the House of Atreus and by earlier sovereigns. Too

small in themselves to be independent fortresses, they prove that even the larger
ones were not independent. Thus military organization and governmental rule

were shown to have existed among a people often referred to as barbarous, whose
works and actions could only be explained by the ancients by referring them to
the mythical Cyclops. The particular features of some of these outworks are very
peculiar. The pyramid was a favourite form of those most remote from the

centre of government. These pyramids Dr. PheniS found east and west of the
Argolic plain, at the extreme boundary of the Parthenium mountain, and as far
almost as Epidaurus ; while between them and the great fortresses, bearing classic

names, were many unnamed and unnoticed Cyclopean structures of considerably

larger dimensions than the pyramids, yet bearing no comparison with the larger

cities. These garrison forts evidently guarded the passes to the great Argolic

plain. The discoveries made by Dr. Schliemann would be soon under their notice
in his forthcoming work ; he should therefore forbear to touch upon them, as it
was ground that that great investigator was exclusively entitled to tread first,
whoever might subsequently support his theories or enter the lists with him anta-
gonistically. But having seen a very large portion of the articles themselves at
Athens, having carefully examined the field of the operations at Mycenns, and
made a close comparison between Dr. Schliemann 's labours at that place and his
labours at Troy, he might, at least, add his testimony to that of others as to the
great historical value and interest of the find and the enormous age of the treasure,
exhibited more prominently in the conditions of the articles of silver. Dr. Phene

inclines to the belief that there is a great deal yet to be learnt of the Cyclopean cities
of Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy. It was remarkable that in the Trojan district
the Cyclopean city of Chigri, which is of great size and high antiquity, has attracted

little notice in ancient or modern times, although many points about it answer
the description of the Trojan city. Visiting the island of Samothrace, he made the

ascent of the mountain, and was, he believed, the only Englishman, at least of

modern times, who had accomplished it. There he found a Cyclopean city larger
than any he had seen on the mainland of Greece. The position ot this large city,
< if which we had neither record nor history, in an island most difficult of access, and

having no harbour or anchorage, awoke questions of thrilling interest, especially as
it was on the island on which the darkest rites of mystery, those of the Cabin, were
practised. With our present limited knowledge it is difficult to identify the

people who constructed these works; but that they came from the mainland vest-

ward into Greece is generally held. If this hypothesis be sound, Samothrace was

probably occupied before the Peloponnesus, and must be much older than either

firyns or Mycense.

                        On the Flora and Fauna of Prehistoric Times.

                           By Prof. Eolleston,' M.D., F.R.S.

   The author, referring to various prehistoric trees, said that the common elm in
this country spreads entirely by suckers and not by seeds, whilst such trees as the
spruce and larch spread with great quickness. The author then pointed out an

error into which Julius Caesar had fallen in reference to the presence in Britain of
certain trees which he had found in Gaul, particularly the Coniferfe. The beech
was probably a prehistoric tree, for beechmast was a very preservable thing.
Buckwheat, or beechweat, and beechmast were one and the same thing in form,
both being of triangular shape. The letters f, a, g, lay at the bottom of the word
for beech in most of tbe ancient languages in which it was named. The terms
" bacon " and " beech " were allied : and a bacon-fed pig was a pig that had been
fed upon beechmast. " Bacon " meant " beech," the article out of which bacon was
made. After going over the list of the trees which chiefly arrest the attention as
forming a portion of the landscape, the author called attention to the fact that

Chaucer, who was essentially a poet of nature, omitted from his detailed lists of

trees the names of the willow, beech, and birch. Spencer, writing later, and pro-
bably with Chaucer's description before him, had supplied the names of these three
trees. It was the opinion of Professor Rolleston that the beech was present in
England in prehistoric times, and that it formed a part of the landscape. Witch-
elm was used, he thought, in very early times, for the making of coffins, whilst
birch had been put to the uses of tools. Remains of the ash were found in English
peat, but they were not to be traced in the Scotch peat : nor were the remains of

the beech to be found in Scotch peat. The spruce fir, or Norway pine, now of
common importation, was not found in England at all, though it will flourish, and
does now flourish, here, and spreads by seed without help. The lime tree was, in

England, taken great care of, and kept for the uses of bees. There was, however,
considerable doubt as to whether or not the lime tree was indigenous to England,
though the author had been informed that at a short distance from Worcester

there was a large wood in which the small lime is found forming the entire mass

of the underwood. Passing from trees to bees and their product, the author

asked the question as to when the hive was introduced. The only real fact which
they were able to get hold of in answer to this was that in all cases they found
the word for hive always like the Latin. The taming of the bee had been

ascribed, without any real reason for so doing, to several nations. People having
neither the sugar-cane nor the beet-root from which to get sugar, would be
compelled to get it from milk or grain, or from similar sources : and honey must
have counted for a very great deal. Passing on to prehistoric fauna, Professor
Rolleston called attention to the great changes which had taken place in the
Mollusca of our country since those times. Referring to what had been termed

the Roman snail, he said that this was, without doubt, a very old and well-esta-
blished British snail. But there was a little snail which had come all the way
from the Caspian, which was now found in such numbers in some parts of England

that it would sometimes stop up water-pipes &c. It had been called a mussel,
and looked something like one. Not long since it was reported that this snail
had been found in prehistoric deposits ; but this the author could not believe. It

came to us in large numbers from Russia with the timber which we got from
that country, and which was floated down the rivers to be put on board ship. It
was easier for these creatures to establish themselves in and along the rivers of a
country than in any other part of it. The rabbit had only very lately established

itself in this country ; for the author had several times found flints &c. at the mouths
of burrows which had been thrown up by rabbits. Now, had these rabbits been in
the country for any very long time, the chances would be that the remains of all
these barrows would have been destroj'ed. Consequently it was his opinion that
the rabbit was not one of our prehistoric animals, but that it was probably brought
over by the Romans, as the chestnut, the sheep, and the fallow-deer had been
brought by them. The white-breasted marten, which had once been very pre-
valent, was a great enemy to the rabbit, and had, doubtless, kept the latter animal

in check. In the Greek islands the rabbit was now very prevalent ; but the Greek
name for the rabbit he did not know ; for though the Greeks mentioned the hare
again and again, they said nothing of the rabbit. The fallow-deer must have
lived in the time of Chaucer, who spoke of " The dreadful roe, the deer, the hart,
the hind."' The Norway rat, or grey rat, was not known in prehistoric times, nor

was the black rat. The rat came to us from the other side of the Volga ; but in

one of the prehistoric tumuli the author had found several handfuls of jawbones

of the common water-rat. This at first puzzled him very much ; but he subse-

quently found amongst the remains a large carnivorous tooth, a canine of the

polecat, one of which animals had evidently made its nest in the tumuli and fed

its young upon water-rats.

   Professor Rolleston exhibited and explained the uses of a flint hammer from

the Western coast of New Guinea.

                    Notes on the Zaparos. By Alfred Simsok.

   TheZaparos are a people in Ecuador, inhabiting chiefly the Curarai and its tri-
butaries, the Nushinu, the Nuganu, Supinu, &c, the main river Napo, in the
neighbourhood of Sinchichieta, and the Yasuni. They are expert woodsmen and

hunters, with very keen eyes and ears. When unprovoked they are shy and

retiring, but are quite fearless, and will not suffer any one to force them by
physical means. They exhibit marked pleasure in the destruction of human life.
The Zaparos are very disunited, and wander about in separate hordes. Their
superstitions were described by the author, who had passed some time with

these Indians.

  On the Colouring-matters in Human Hair. By H. C. Sorbt, F.B.S. 6,'c.

   This was only a provisional account of the author's experiments. He has been

able to separate several well-marked different-coloured substances. The chief
of these are the black pigment and a red-brown substance, which, when oxidized,
passes into a yellow colouring-matter. Though very red human hair contains a
small quantity of a pink-red substance, yet by far the greater number of the

different tints of human hair may be explained by supposing that it contains a

varying amount of a variable mixture of the above-named three substances.

On Ethnology of West Cornwall. By the Rev. W. S. Lach-Szyrma.

The variations of races that go together to make the present population of West

Cornwall are to be divided into two classes :

1. Those Britons who came here from pressure of the Saxon invasion, and the

aboriginal or jMa«'-aboriginal Uamounii.

2. Those who came as immigrants to settle on the coast districts.

1. The Cornu-Britons are the backbone of the population. Their language was

Address by Admiral Sir Erasmus Ommanney, Knt., C.B., F.E.S., F.E.A.S.,

                                  F.R.G.S., President of the Section.

In opening the proceedings of this Section, it occurs to me that it will be interesting

to take a general review of the magnitude of Geographical research, and the

advance in Geographical science which has been effected during the lapse of time

since this great National Association assembled in this renowned town and naval

port of the West.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science has met in Plymouth but

pnce before, in 1841                                                                                                          During that thirty-six years of time our globe, whilst gyrating
                                                                                                                           .

in its orbit through nearly twenty-three thousand millions of miles in its progress

round the sun, has turned on its own axis 13,000 times : it can scarcely fail to be
a question of some interest to mark at the end of this period what Geographers

have been about on the surface of this globe whilst it has thus been bodily pro-

pelled through this stupendous space.

   Before entering, however, upon this consideration of the advances that have
been made on the then unknown regions of the globe, I would draw pointed

attention to the change which has been effected by the recognition of Geography

in the proceedings of this Association since the last meeting here in 1841. Geo-

raphy was then ranked only as a subordinate branch of one of the Sections ; it

now forms a Section of its own, and we may say tbat it always commands a con-

siderable and increasing share of public interest. This growing interest is due, in a

great degree, to the exciting and important revelations made by great discoveries,
and. the presence of many renowned travellers at our meetings. This independent

position must mainly be ascribed to the labours of those distinguished and learned

men who took a lea'd in the organization of the Royal Geographical Society of

London                                        foremost amongst                                                                them  should  be  placed  the  names  of Hamilton,  Grecn-
                                           :

   The enlarged views now held by geographers in a more scientific direction is

certainly a satisfactory feature in the progress alluded to ; for in 1841 Physical
           TRANSACTIONS OV THE SECTIONS.  123

Geography was not studied : the teaching of geography was then little more than a

dry catalogue of places and countries, sketched on plane surfaces. The geography

that is now taught in schools is a description of the physical condition of all the

surface of the earth. In way of illustration of this progress, draw a comparison
of an old school map of 1841 with one of the hest forms of school maps recently

produced hy Stanford. Physical Geography is now looked upon as an essential

work in the routine of ordinary education. The geographers of the present day,

whilst appreciating the marvellous achievements of our great travellers, com-

monly deplore the deficiency of scientific training which blinded the observation

from perception as to the value of many treasures in nature for scientific purposes.

Geographical science has of late years received considerable impulse from the

establishment of new societies on the Continent, and most especially from the

inauguration of International Congresses, which are destined to renew in a v. ide

field of action all that has been so auspiciously established within the British

Islands by our own Association. The movement was inaugurated in the renowned

city of Antwerp in 1871, the native place of Mercator, and was marked by a great

Asuccess.  second International Congress of geographers was held in Paris in

1875, which was equally satisfactory in its results. The first fruits that have

been already gathered from the effect of international cooperation have been the

discussion of unsettled problems, the establishment between nations of a common

interest in the great expeditions of discovery, the improvements of instruments

adapted to the particular needs of travellers and navigators, and of the methods of

delineation adopted for maps and charts. Amongst the distinguished foreigners

who have taken a leading position in the diffusion of geographical knowledge,

there is no one who deserves a more grateful recognition at our hands than
Dr. Augustus Petermann, of Gotha, the now somewhat venerable editor of the

' Geographische Mittheilungen,' which has for so long a period poured its streams

of valuable information over the world.

   It will be fresh in the memory of many assembled here, how excellent an oppor-

tunity of comparing the position and methods of the past with those of the present

day, in all that relates to geographical investigation, was afforded by the Loan
Exhibition of scientific instruments and appliances which was established at South
Kensington last year. The visitor to that Exhibition was able to compare the
astrolabe of Sir Francis Drake and of the mariners who steered the Spanish
Armada to the coast of England, the back-staff of John Davis, the quadrant of
Hadley and of Captain Cook, with the finished specimens of the sextant of this
day ; the compass of Galileo with the standard compass of the Admiralty, cor-
rected by the Astronomer Royal, for use on board iron ships, and with the light
multiple-needle of Sir William Thomson. The collection of maps, charts, and
models which were exhibited effectually demonstrated all that has been said con-
cerning the advance of geographical science. Here was to be seen a copy of the
chart of the coast of America discovered by Columbus on his second voyage,
made by the pilot who accompanied him ; a chronometer which belonged to
Captain Cook, and was taken by him to the Pacific in 1776, and was again taken
to the Pacific by Captain Bligh in the ' Bounty,' 1787 (it was taken possession of
by the mutineers atPitcairn's Island, and was sold in 1808 by Adams to a citizen
of the United States at Chili, where it was purchased by Captain Sir Thomas
Herbert, R.N.). The manuscript maps of Livingstone, together with the instru-

ments used by that great African traveller on his last journey, were exhibited ; and

what was of personal interest to me was " the first traces ever found of the

Franklin Expedition," discovered by Captain E. Oninianney, II.M.S. ' Assistance,'

on 23rd August, 1850, at Franklin's first winter quarters near Beechey Island.
But of all the inventions of interest to the navigator was " the bathometer," pro-
duced by the genius of Dr. Siemens, for measuring the depth of the sea without

sounding-lines. By means of this instrument, which can be placed in the cabin,

the mariner can record with the same ease as reading off the barometric pressure
the depth of the sea beneath him at a moment's glance.

   In the year 1841 the triangulation of the British Islands was in progress ; the
great base-line on Salisbury Plain, which was to be made the test of the accuracy

                                                                                                 10*

of the work, remained to be surveyed ; this base was laid down in 1849 ; the
primary base-line, on the margin of Lough Foyle, was measured in 1827. The base
on Salisbury Plain was 360 miles away, aud its length in the first instance was

computed by a connected series of triangles projected on from Lough Foyle. When

this base was measured by the standard compensation base, it was found that the

actual measurement agreed within five inches of the length computed by the

triaugulation and trigonometry : this fairly expresses the accuracy which had now

been introduced into this branch of surveying.

The English triaugulation was connected with the systems of France and

Belgium in 1862, and in 1865 a remarkable International Congress was held at

Southampton, in which town the standards of linear measure of England, India,

Russia, Belgium, Prussia, Austria, Spain, Italy, and the United States were com-

pared with each other as a preliminary to a measurement of a great arc of a

parallel of latitude. In the very year in which the British Association last met at

Plymouth, the arc of India, which extends from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, was

completed. In 1867 a base-line was measured at Bangalore, which was found to

be within a quarter of an inch of the length that had been assigned to it by a

series of triangles from Vizagapatam. The detailed plan of the survey of London

was completed on 326 sheets in 1871. General Dufour brought out his celebrated

map of Switzerland in 25 sheets : this is one of the finest specimens of mapping the

physical features of a country ever accomplished.

In the work of hydrographical progress we have ample reason to be proud of

--all that has been accomplished by this country, under the direction of those

eminent hydrographers of the Admiralty Beaufort, Richards, and Evans. To enu-

merate all the work that has been carried out by the several scientific naval

officers employed in the surveying service all over the world, and give them a full

consideration of their merits, is beyond the limits of this brief space ; the accuracy
of our surveys is so thoroughly credited, that our Admiralty charts and sailing

directions afford to the mariners of this great maritime nation every confidence in

the pursuit of their calling. The delineation of our charts has attained such a high

degree of boldness in style and clearness as to give them a reputation of excellence

among all nations. Although our maritime surveyors have accomplished mighty

work in the examination and the correctly laying down a very extensive pro-

portion of the coasts on our globe, there remains a large amount of interesting

--work for our attention ; for the " unsurveyed world " is of considerable extent new

routes are opened up to the commercial world in unfrequented seas, which demand

the careful examination of the skilled marine surveyor.

During the period now before us, our kindred across the Atlantic have taken up

a very high position in this branch of hydrography : the admirable manner in which

the Cnited-States Coast Survey has been conducted is exemplary to all nations as

regards its liberal provision, as well as for the comprehensive and systematic

method of execution in carrying out this great work. I would point to the

reports made to Congress for the last quarter of a century as containing matter of

surprising interest both to the mariner as well as to the scientist ; every new

object is recorded with minute precision, an enormous amount of information is

collected on meteorology, magnetism, tides and currents, as well as on hydrography

and geography; also discussions on the causes as to the increase and decrease of

coral-reefs, besides important additions to natural history ; above all, the complete

investigation and information regarding the great Gulf-Stream. It is a work

nobly organized and executed, truly worthy of a great maritime nation. Here

I deem it as opportune for this Section to accord a tribute of praise to the works of

Captain Maury, of the United States. He has honoured us with his presence at

--the meetings of this Association, and favoured us with the benefit of his informa-

tion his elaborate charts of the trade-winds of the Atlantic Ocean and his laborious

work on ' Winds and Currents ' being a combination of science and experience

which have contributed to abridge  our long ocean voyages                                                                                          the  production of  his

marvellous work, the ' Physical Geography of the Sea,' in which the " wonders of

the deep " led the way to a general interest on the subject of oceanic physics, and

its style and language are so engrossing that it is attractive to the general reader, and

takes its place as a work of literary excellence.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  125

    It is no less our duty to recognize the services of Admiral Sir Edward Belcher,
who was a constant attendant at this Section, and was a great contributor to the
proceedings of several branches of this Association. As a marine surveyor, he
leaves behind hiru a large amount of work in all quarters of the globe, which is

celebrated for accuracy. He published a very able work on ' Marine Surveying/

The greatest portion of his life was devoted to the surveying service in all parts of

the world. He first came into notice as lieutenant of the ' Blossom,' in the expedition

to meet Franklin in 182G-27, on the latter's journey along the coast to ascertain the

practicability of a North-west Passage ; and his last service was in command of
an Arctic expedition in search of Franklin's ships, when a large extent of new
discovery was added to our charts of the Arctic seas ; and the rescue of McClure
from his perilous position was accomplished by the expedition under his orders

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

so that he took a large share in the completion of the so-called North-west

Passage.

   At the very time that the British Association was holding its last meeting at
Plymouth, Captain James 0. Boss was engaged on his memorable expedition into

the Antarctic Sea, a region replete with interest for discovery and scientific in-
vestigation. The ' Erebus ' and ' Terror,' old bomb-ships, were selected for this
service, names for ever famed to posterity. James Boss and his second, Captain
F. B. M. Crozier, afterwards second to Franklin, and survivor, in command, were

officers of tried experience and scientific attainments, who served many a year in
all the voyages under the renowned Parry. Men endowed with less courage and

practical knowledge would never have faced the perils and hazards in pushing
through streams of floating ice and icebergs for hundreds of miles, until arrested
by the formidable impenetrable precipice of eternal glacier which caps the south

pole axis of our globe.

   This expedition was sent forth by a representation from the British Association,
in 1838, on behalf of those eminent savants of the day in this country and in
Europe, chiefly in the cause of terrestrial magnetism in the southern hemisphere,
in connexion with a system of simultaneous observations which were being con-
ducted at fixed stations at various points on the earth's surface ; and to no better
hands could this great undertaking have been entrusted than to James Boss, who
fixed the position of and planted the British flag on the north magnetic pole.

   The expedition set out in August 1839, and returned in safety in September
1843, bringing results of the highest importance in the history of maritime discovery,
the crowning feature being the discovery of Victoria Land, lying between the
parallels of 70° and 78° S., with two high mountains, named Erebus and Terror,

respectively 12,400 and 10,900 feet elevation above the level of the sea,
Erebus being a volcano in full action, emitting flame and smoke in awful majesty
amidst its glacial and silvery solitudes. The southern progress was arrested by a
coast presenting a vertical cliff of ice from two to three hundred feet high, which
being higher than the ships' mastheads precluded any observation into the
interior of this supposed continent. This imposing icy barrier was examined for
some hundred miles ; it is the nursery of icebergs, and was found inaccessible

everywhere.

   The position of the South magnetic pole was laid within the icy barrier, and
approximately determined from lat. 76° 12' S., and long. 104° E. ; the magnetic dip
there observed was 88° 40' ; the pole was assigned to be 160 miles from the ship on

the 17th February, 1841.
   Iu the following year a further examination of the icy barrier was attempted,

and the highest southern Latitude ever attained by man was on the 23rd February,
1842, when the mean latitude of the two ships was 78° 10' S. Throughout I lie

voyage a series of magnetic observations were recorded without intermission, witli
the utmost regularity, thus accomplishing the main object in view: the mass of

work brought home has taken some years to discuss, under the direction of

Sir Ed. Sabine.

   In this expedition oceanic physics was a prominent work ; deep-sea soundings and

dredgings were frequently obtained ; serial observations for temperature, the con-
ditions of sea-water at the surface and at great depths, have supplied data for

theorizing on oceanic circulation. As many as 161 deep-sea temperature soundings

were obtained, chiefly in the southern and Antarctic oceans, varying from 12 to
7200 feet; in lat. 15° 33', long. 23° 14' W., soundings were tried for with 4000
fathoms of line, the greatest depths of the ocean that had ever been satisfactorily

ascertained up to that time. Meteorological observations of great value were
made, and the fact established that a lower barometric pressure exists in the
Southern hemisphere than in the Northern. It is impossible to do more than

refer to the above leading results of this voyage, reflecting so much honour on the

skill and courage of all concerned in it.

   Those regions on our terrestrial surface which have attracted the enterprising

--traveller are naturally those where civilized men have not penetrated the ice--
bound seas of the Arctic regions ; also the interior of Africa, which in 1841 was a

blank on our map, where the equator alone extends through a stretch of something-

like 2000 miles, and the northern tropic through more than 4000 miles of land.

Little was known of Australia within the fringe of settlers located on certain parts

of the coast. I will therefore, in the first instance, speak of Arctic exploration,

which has so recently culminated in the Expedition under Nares to the Polar Sea.

  When the British Association met here in 1841, Franklin had not started on his

memorable attempt to force the North-west Passage from the Atlantic to the

Pacific Oceans                                                                     at that time the  coast-line of Arctic "America had  not    been com-

pletely explored. It was not known whether the projecting mass of Boothia was

connected with the American continent, or whether the neighbouring Kino- "Wil-

liam's Land was an island or a peninsula. Parry, in 1819, had discovered the

group of islands extending to the west from Wellington Channel, still bearing his
name and twelve

West Boothia.

time were lost to sight.

It was not until 1848 that the Government yielded to the public demand for

succour being sent after the missing ships ; and an expedition, consisting of the

' Investigator' and 'Enterprise,' under the command of that distinguished Arctic
and Antarctic voyager, Sir James Ross, was sent out. The extent of his efl'orts
was hunted to a small range of search. His ships wintered at Port Leopold, at the

entrance of Regent's Inlet. In the spring of 1849 he made a sledge journey alono-

the shores of North Somerset and to the east side of Peel                                                                           Sound to lat. 72°  38,

advance, owing to Barrow Straits being blocked with ice, Ross returned home
with his ships, but without a vestige of Franklin's people. Universal disappoint-
ment was manifested at this result. The veteran traveller, Sir John Richardson,
with the noble spirit of sacrifice to duty for which he was distinguished, had re-
turned from his examination of the Arctic shores of America, between the Mackenzie
and the Coppermine rivers, without finding any clue to the missing ships. Thia
was sacred ground to him, associated as it was with the trials undergone when he
was the companion of Franklin in their overland journey to the Arctic coasts, 1820

-21, to discover the North-west Passage. The Admiralty, the Hudson's Bay Com-
pany, the United States and Russian Governments, together with private enter-

prise, all combined, in 1850, to leave nothing undone to secure an effectual pursuit
alter I rank-tin's ships, the 'Erebus' and ' Terror.' The two ships brought back-
by Sir James Ross were fitted out with all dispatch, to enter the Arctic seas through

Behnng Straits before the navigation season of 1850 closed. You all know
the eventful history of those two ships, the < Enterprise ' (Captain Colhnson) and
Investigator (Commander McClure). They parted company in the Pacific Ocean
never to meet again,--thus becoming, in fact, two separate expeditions, and adding

greatly to our geographical knowledge, by filling up the vacant space on our charts
mbetween the continent of America and the Parry group. The ' Investigator' was

abandoned Mercy Bay, on the north coast of Banks's Land, by McClure and his
gallant crew, leaving the British ensign and pennant flying. There they probably
will remain, a monument to our intrepid band of seamen who completed the North-
west Passage, the relics of which, like those of Barentz in his North-east expedi-

tion, recently found at Novaia Zemblia, may be lighted on some three centuries
hence. The ' Enterprise,' bv hugging the Arctic shore of America from Behring

Straits to Dease Straits, has 'proved the practicability of accomplishing the North-

west Passage from Baffin's Bay to the Pacific in one season, in a vessel suitable
for the service. This was the object which Sir Allen Young had in view when ho
generously diverted his expedition into Smith's Sound last year, to effect a com-

munication with Nares's Polar Expedition.
   Lieutenant Pullen had examined the coast between Wainwright's Inlet and the

Mackenzie River in the autumn of 1849, in a boat voyage full of adventure ; no
traces of Franklin's ships were discovered, nor had the Esquimax seen any thing of

them or the crews.
   In 1850, the Behring Straits Expedition being fairly set off, the Admiralty

purchased two ships, the ' Resolute ' and ' Assistance,' to which were attached two
steam tenders, the ' Pioneer ' and ' Intrepid.' The introduction of steam, and an

improved form of ship with fine lines, instead of the square-ended bomb-vessels of

Parry's time, marked a new era in Arctic navigation, and facilitated the means of

exploring the icy regions. This expedition was sent to follow up the search via

Barrow's Straits, and entrusted to the command of Capt. H. T. Austin in the ' Re-

solute,' seconded by Capt. E. Ommanney in the ' Assistance,' Lieutenant Sherard

Osborn commanding the ' Pioneer,' Lieutenant Cator the ' Intrepid.' Simultane-

ously with this expedition it was desirable to enlist the services of men experienced
Ain the enterprising and hazardous life of the whaling trade.
                                                                        carte blanche was

confided to Captain William Penny, a seaman eminently qualified for the object he

had at heart, to equip an expedition in the north. Two smart clipper brigs were

fitted out with every requisite for the service, and manned by a noble set of daring

seamen experienced in ice navigation. These vessels, the ' Lady Franklin ' and

' Sophia,' set out from Aberdeen on April 13th, 1850, with the object of searching

commanded  by  Lieutenant  E.   J.  De Haven,            United         States Navy                                                   and  the  veteran

Sir John Ross, at three score and ten, started in a small schooner to look for his

old friend Sir John Franklin.

I will now pass briefly through the proceedings of the expedition most interest-

ing to myself, the one above-named, under Austin and Ommanney, which left Green-

hithe, 4th May, 1850. In our passage through Baffin's Bay we were more or les3

obstructed and detained by ice, reaching Cape York, in North Greenland, early in

August. Here we divided into two expeditions--the < Resolute ' and ' Pioneer

proceeded  to  examine  Pond's  Bay                      I was left to  search the north                                              shores of  Bar-

row Straits. Having embarked an Esquimaux at Cape York, we first examined
Wolstenholme Sound, and found a record left there by H.M.S. ' North Star,' which

had been forced to pass the winter there ; then crossing the north water of Baffin's

Bay, through loose ice, the coast of North Devon, from Cape Warrender to Cape

Riley at the entrance of the Wellington Channel, was examined, discovering Port

Dundas. On the 23rd August, 1850, whilst searching along the shore at Cape

Riley, I stumbled on " the first traces ever found of Franklin's ships " since they

were last seen in Baffin's Bay in 1845, consisting of fragments of stores and

clothing. Cape Riley is the southern point of the Bay, which proved to be the
Wefirst winter quarters of Franklin, 1845-46.
                                                                        searched about in vain on

Beechey Island and around the locality, but to our grievous disappointment no

record could be found, though the sad evidence afforded by three graves, with the

names of the deceased seamen and their ships, was a confirmation that the ' Erebus'

and ' Terror ' left their quarters in the summer of 184(3. Seeing that the other

ships were coming up in order to follow the clue so happily found, whilst the few
days of navigation were available, it was incumbent on me to push across Wel-
lington Channel with the 'Assistance' and ' Intrepid ' for Cape Hotham, Corn-

wallis Land. In doing this we were closely beset in heavy ice, and sustained, some

very awkward pressures. The south coast of Cornwallis Land was explored without

finding further traces. September set in, the navigation season closed, and the ex-

pedition was finally frozen in for the winter two miles eastward of Griffith Island.

With regard to the other expeditions, Penny's vessels took up their winter

quarters in Assistance Bay, about forty miles to the eastward of our position, as

did also Sir John Ross. The American Tessels under De Haven got beset in "Wel-

lington Channel, and they drifted helplessly under the influence of that current

which bears such a remarkable feature in ocean circulation, and is so eventful
in the history of Arctic voyagers. De Haven's ships, beset in pack ice, were

drifted through Lancaster Sound into Baffin's Bay, then soiithward to Davis

Straits, and, after an anxious winter, were released in the Atlantic Ocean.

Throughout the winter of 1850-51 our speculations were incessant as to the

course Franklin had taken from Erebus and Terror Bay, and our minds and eflbrts

were cheerfully devoted to preparations for sledge travelling with the return of

sprinsr. Although we were not fortunate in finding a harbour for wintering iD,

we were in fixed ice out of the influence of currents. Our expeditions were in

good position for searching the south shore of the Parry Islands, and exploring

beyond Cape Walker, which was distant about CO miles to the S.W. As regards

Penny's vessels, they were well situated for searching the Wellington Channel

northward. With the fine crews at our command and ample resources, we had

the means of exploring all the coasts westward and southward, and ascertaining

the fate of our missing countrymen. On the Behring Straits side of the North-

west Passage depot ships were in station, and Collinson's expedition from the

Pacific we fondly hoped might meet us halfway in 1851.

The year 1851 opened with sanguine hopes that Franklin's track would be fallen

Wein with.  had searched many conspicuous positions for record, the absence of

which involved a mystery over his course from Beechey Island. In April our

sledging parties set out, perfectly organized and trained, to carry out exploration

to the utmost limit of our resources. To examine the south shores of the Parry

Islands and reach Winter Barbour of Parry was an important object; but to reach

Cape Walker and follow on the course south-west from that position to the Ame-

rican continent, as suggested to Franklin in his instructions, afforded the best hopes

of success. This route of search was confided to me, and, with Lieutenant Osborn,

six officers, and forty-five men, we crossed over Barrow Straits 60 miles to Cape

Walker. "Again no traces found." I provided for a search along the west shore

of Peel Inlet, down to lat. 72° 49" N., long. 96° 40' W., whilst I continued the ex-

amination of the coast, accompanied by Lieutenant Osborn, to the west and south to

Ommanney Bay, and attained a position in lat. 72° 40' X., long. 105° W., the extre-

mity of our journey. This land I named Prince-of-Wales Land. The coast trended

away to the south-east, and around the horizon bounded a sea of solid heavy ice.

On the very same day of reaching our extreme west (24th May, 1851) it became

known to us afterwards that a party was advancing towards us from McClure's

ship, the ' Investigator,' in Prince-of-Wales Straits, to a point in lat. 72° 21' N.,

long. 112° W. : thus on that very day a party from the Pacific, and one from the

Atlantic Ocean, were within  140 miles  of each   other                             except  for  this  small  gap

between us the North-west Passage was completed ! I retraced the shores of

Prince-of-Wales Land to Cape Walker, 200 miles of coast, and reached the ' As-

sistance ' again off Griffith Island, after an absence of sixty days from the ship, and

having travelled over 500 miles.

The land explored was generally low, and covered with hard frozen snow, veiy

destitute of animal life, a most dreary journey ; the only vestige of a human being

having trod this land before was the remains of a very old cache, with fragments of

Abones.  low shingly beach in many parts indicated shallow water ofl* the coast,

on which a frozen sea of ice rested, in many places of great thickness. The one

feature of scientific interest of the journey was fixing the magnetic meridian of 180°,

passing due north of the magnetic pole. Lieutenant McClintock accomplished a

great achievement in reaching Melville Islaud of Parry, and Liddon Gulf; the

search of Parry's Winter Harbour was of great interest, conspicuous records and other

traces of that noble navigator were found there.

   Lieutenant McClintock was absent 80 days from the ship ; the parties under him
had searched all the southern shores and inlets of the Parry Islands ; his own party

travelled 700 miles, a marvellous feat for seamen.

   In the mean time Penny's expedition had explored both sides of the Wellington
Channel to a high latitude, 76° 25' N, travelling over a large extent of new ground
                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                  129

I a cluster of islands in the broadest part of the channel; to the north-west of

the channel he observed open water leading to the Polar Sea.

With the end of June sledge-travelling ceased, and with it came disappointment

Ano clue of the missing ships had been traced from Beechey Island.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  large extent

of new ground had been thoroughly searched, yet their fate remained shrouded in

mystery. The amount of sledge-travelling was unprecedented (this mode of explo-

ration in icy regions was here developed to perfection) ; our great journeys were

accomplished without loss or sickness ; the total distance actually travelled over

by our crews amounted to 5817 miles, under the severity of Arctic cold.

The summing up of results and opinions inferred that Franklin had not gone

westward, and an examination of Jones Sound, at the head of Baffin's Bay, was

made, with no better success, before the expedition returned to England.

The year 1851 closed replete with matter of great Arctic interest. Extensive

exploration had been carried out beyond any that had been effected before. Im-

portant additions to science and geography had been obtained. The first wintering

quarters of the Franklin                                                                      Expedition had been discovered                                                                                                                                                 but regarding the course

country clamoured for another search.

   The same ships were refitted : Sir Edward Belcher, in the ' Assistance/ had the

aided by McClintock and Osborn, in the steam tender, with a depot ship to ac-

company them                                                                         these vessels left Woolwich, April loth,                                                                                                                                                1852.

   Search to the north-west up the Wellington Channel, and to Melville Island, was
the tenor of the Admiralty instructions. From Beechey Island the Expedition di-
vided into two divisions : Belcher was favoured with open water, and attained a
wintering' quarter at Northumberland Inlet, in a high northern latitude, nearly 77°

IN'., on the north-east coast of the Wellington Channel. Kellet and McClintock

reached Melville Island, and were compelled to winter near Dealy Island, about

30 miles eastward of Parry's Winter Harbour. At the sandstone bearing the in-

scription that Parry wintered there in 1819-20, while laying out provision depots

for spring travelling, Lieutenant Mecham, on the 14th of October, found at Winter

Harbour the important record deposited by Commander McClure in April 1852,

which stated that H.M.S. ' Investigator ' was frozen up in Mercy Bay, Banks's Land,

and had completed the North-west Passage. At that period of the year, October,

it was impossible to send a party across the straits which separated the two ships

' Resolute' and 'Investigator.'

of- Wales Straits, where the winter of 1850-51 was passed. An excursion from the

' Investigator ' took McClure through the straits to an open sea, and on 26th October,

1851, he pitched his tent upon the shores of Barrow Straits (now called Parry

Sound), lat. 70° 31' N., long. 114° 14' W., the land on the north being that put
down by Parry, in 1820, as Banks's Land. Thus was established the existence of a

passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, denominated the North-west

Passage.

   McClure passed the first winter in Prince -of-Wales Straits ; in his spring travelling
he had explored Baring Island and the north shores of Prince Albert's Land, embracing

800 miles of coast ; but not a vestige of civilized man was seen. With the return

of the navigation season his attempts to push through Prince-of-Wales Straits into
Barrow Straits failed, from an unbroken body of ice covering the sea beyond these

W.straits; his greatest advance in that direction was lat. 73° 18' N, long; 115° 32'

Retracing his course through Prince-of-Wales Straits, and rounding Nelson Head,
he continued hugging along the coast of Baring Island, trending northward, con-
tending with formidable ice and severe pressures, overcoming perils and hazards

found safety on the 24th of Septemher, 1851, in Mercy Bay, lat. 74° 6' N., long.

W1 18° 15' . That night the ' Investigator ' was firmly frozen in, never to be re-

leased.

   The winter passed. In April 1852 McClure crossed the straits, sledging over to
Melville Island ; at Winter Harbour he deposited a record of his position at the

sandstone bearing the inscription of Pan-y's visit; he here found the record of
McClintock left by him in 1851, on his journey from the ' Assistance.'

   The summer of 1852 passed away, keeping the ' Investigator ' in her ice-bound
prison ; a second winter was to be passed in Mercy Bay, on short allowance of pro-
visions; mean temperature of January 1853 was --44°. Arrangements were made
for abandoning the ship, when, early in April, a party from Kellett's ship at Mel-
ville Island electrified their vision; the means of succour were at hand. The sequel
was, the ' Investigator ' was abandoned ; McClure and his gallant band were trans-
ferred to the ' Resolute,' Captain Kellett, and under his command they reached
England, in 1854, via Barrow Straits.

   During the spring and summer of 1853, great work was accomplished by the
crews of Belcher's division and Kellett's under McClintock, Richards, Osborn,
Hamilton, &c, under whose leadership the configuration of the northern shores of

--the Parry Islands was completed, and large geographical discoveries were added to

the North Polar regions McClintock's explorations of Prince Patrick's Islands,
and Sir Edward Belcher's discovery of Belcher Straits connected with Jones Sound,
leading to Baffin's Bay, accompanied by valuable scientific and hydrographical in-
formation. I will not prolong the account of the proceedings of those gallant ex-

plorers any further. By Sir Edward Belcher's orders his ships were all abandoned

in 1854, the officers and crews fell back to Erebus and Terror Bay, and finally reached

England with the heroes of the North-west Passage. And here ended the Govern-
ment search for Franklin's ships. But where could they be ? Beyond my dis-

covery of the first traces in 1850, nothing authentic of their whereabouts had been

--found their fate remained shrouded in mystery.

   The services which Dr. John Rae, the eminent Arctic traveller, rendered to this
cause in the search for Franklin added a considerable extent of new coast-line in
connexion with the North-west Passage. In 1851 he descended the Coppermine
River, and crossed the strait over to Wollaston Band, near Cape Franklin ; then
explored the coast in a north-west route up to Cape Baring, in 70° N. lat. and 117°

17' W. long., and returned to Port Confidence early in June. After a few days'

rest he set off again on a boat expedition, and explored a continuous coast-line along
Wollaston Land to Victoria Land on to a position in lat. 70° 2' N., long. 101° 25' W.,
on the 15th August, which was the extreme limit of his journey, where his naviga-
tion was stopped by ice. Victoria Straits separated him from King William Island.
Could Rae have then advanced 50 miles due east he must have struck on the site
of Franklin's disaster. Rae retraced his course along the shores of Victoria and
Wollaston Land, returning to Fort Confidence by 10th September. In these two

ably conducted journeys he travelled along 400 miles of new-discovered coast. He

met with Esquimaux who knew nothing of Franklin's ships, but picked up some
pieces of wood and line bearing the Government mark. Amongst other contribu-
tions to Geography was the spirited summer voyage of Commander Inglefield in a
small schooner in 1852, when he entered Smith's Sound to a higher latitude than
was ever attempted before. Some extent of coast-line was added to on this route

into the Polar Sea.

   In October, 1854, important intelligence was received from Dr. Rae, who had been

sent to the North in 1853 to complete certain surveys on the west coast of Boothia.
After wintering at Repulse Bay, during his spring journey he met with Esquimaux,
in whose possession he found several articles, including pieces of plate, on one of
which Sir John Franklin's crest was engraved, which were identified as belonging

to the officers of the ' Erebus ' and ' Terror,' and was told that a party of white men
had perished some four years gone by. The recovery of these precious relics, the
only ones found since those discovered by me at Cape Riley and Beechey Island,
together with the statements made by the Esquimaux, was conclusive as to the fact

that the ships must have been abandoned near the neighbouring coast. This painful

discovery, and the return of Belcher's expedition, may be said to terminate the

Franklin search, which had been earned on by this Government since 1847. The

exploration produced valuable results for geographers, which are seen at a glance
by comparing the Arctic chart of 1845 with that of the year 1854.

   The ' Enterprise,' under Captain Collinson, returned to Behring Straits in 1851,
and followed closely on the discovery of Prince-of-Wales Straits by McClure in 1850,
and the researches of Dr. Rae upon Wollaston and Victoria Lands, collecting much.

valuable geographical and hydrographical information of great interest, spending
three winters in the Arctic Sea. The first winter was passed in Prince-of-Wales

Straits, and he communicated with Melville Island. Frustrated, like McClure, in
passing through this Strait to the north-east, Collinson made for the Dolphin and

Union Strait, and coasted eastward to Cambridge Bay, where he passed the second

winter. In the spring of 1853 he attained the lat. of 70° 25' N. on Victoria Land,
and thus, like Rae, was actually within a few miles of the last resting-place of
Franklin's ships. With exhausted supplies, and seeing no prospect of advance to
King William's Land, he had to .return to Behring Straits by the same route ; but,
unfortunately, before he reached the Strait the ship was again beset in ice for a

third winter, which was passed in Camden Bay ; and in August 1854 he effected

his escape by Behring Straits, and reopened communication with the civilized world

after an interval of 1,126 days.

An expedition was generously provided by the United States Government for the

search of Franklin through Smith Sound, under the command of Dr. Kane, in a vessel

Aof 120 tons.    winter station was gained the first summer in lat. 78° 37' N., long.

70° 40' W., on the Greenland coast. Many interesting discoveries and scientific

observations collected were of great value. The coast of Greenland was traced to

lat. 81° 22' N., and on the American side of Kennedy Channel to 82° 30' N. Open

water was Been in the Polar Sea. The lands discovered north of the 80th parallel

were named Grinnell on the American side of the Strait leading to the Polar Sea,

and Washington Land on the Greenland side. In this highest latitude ever wintered

in, the sun was 120 days below the horizon. The lowest temperature observed in-

dicated -70° F.

The geological structure of the lands was fully described by Dr. Kane, together

with the natural history and botany of these regions : the stupendous Humboldt
glacier and smaller glaciers were grand features, and afforded evidence as being the

source of iceberg supply. Moreover, life exists in this locality in the shape of a tribe

of Esquimaux isolated from the rest of the world.
   The heavy floe-ice never cleared out of Smith's Sound; and, after the second

winter, the vessel was abandoned ; Kane with his followers escaped in boats after a

perilous voyage to Upernavik.

  A few years subsequently (1860-61) another Polar expedition left the United

States, under Hayes, for these regions ; but such was the condition of Smith's
Sound then, which was choked with ice, that Hayes could not effect an entrance
into it with his sailing schooner, so had to winter at Port Foulke.

   After all that was done in the searching between 1847 and 1855, beyond the

relics and graves found at Beechey Island by me in 1850, and the relics recovered

by Rae, no authentic records of the ill-fated expedition had come to light through-
out the vast extent of coast explored under so many highly gifted and zealous

leaders.

   There still remained a strong feeling on the part of the public and the relatives
of Franklin's Expedition to clear away the mystery connected with the discovery
of Rae ; though it was evident that the ships had been abandoned, yet no records
or documents had yet been foimd. The limited area for search lay south of Peel

Inlet.

   Lady Franklin, supported by Sir Roderick Murchison, Allen Young, and other
eminent names, contributed largely towards a " final search " for the ' Erebus ' and
' Terror.' The yacht ' Fox ' was purchased, and the command fell into the able hands

of Captain F. Leopold McClintock, already distinguished for his remarkable feats

of ice sledge-travelling and explorations; Lieutenant W. R. Hobson, R.N., and

Captain Allen Young came forward and served under him. Well furnished with

all requisites, the 'Fox' left Aberdeen the 1st July, 1857. On her outward voyage she

became beset in crossing the north water of Melville Bay, and was frozen in for the

winter, which was passed drifting bodily with the pack-ice southward in the pre-

vailing current. She was beset in lat. 75^° N., and drifted in 242 days to lat. 63£° X.,

long. 58° 25' W., altogether 1194 geographical miles. On April 28th, 1858, the

{ Fox ' anchored in the Danish harbour of Holsteinborg in Greenland. Nothing

daunted by this detention of a dreary winter imprisonment in the ice-pack, with the

attendant anxieties and perils, after a refit McClintock proceeded northward again

with better success, touching at Beechey Island, the first winter quarters of Franklin,

and then went down Prince Kegent's Inlet to Bellot Straits, where the ' Fox ' was

frozen in for the winter. With the return of spring (1859) travelling parties set off to

explore West Boothia and King William's Land, which resulted in the great discovery

of the " Record," the only one ever found, raid which was picked up near the site

of the magnetic pole fixed by James Bo.^s (1831). The contents were brief, and to

this effect : that the expedition ascended the Wellington Channel to lat. 77° N.,

that it returned by the west side of Cornwallis Island, and wintered, 1845-46, at

Beechey Island. After leaving Beechey Island the ships were beset on 12th Sep-

tember 1840, and continued wintering in the ice until 24th May 1847, when they
W,were in lat. 70° 5' N., long. 98° 23'
                                               on which day Lieutenant Gore and Mr.

Des Vaux with six men left the ship all well; Bound the margin of the record is

written :

--"April 25th, 1848. JE.M. ships 'Erebus 'and ' Terror ' were deserted on the

22nd April, five leagues N.N.W. of this, having been beset since 12th September,
1846. The officers and crews, consisting of 105 souls, under the command of Cap-

tain F. 11. M. Crozier, landed at lat. 69° 37' 49", long. 98° 41'. This paper was

found by Lieutenant Nairn, under the cairn supposed to have been built by Sir

James Boss in 1831, four miles to the northward, where it had been deposited by

the late Commander Gore in June, 1847. Sir James Boss has not, however, been

foimd, and the paper has been transferred to this position, which is that in which

Sir James Boss's pillar was erected. Sir John Franklin died on the 11th June,

1847, and the total loss by death in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers

and 15 men.

and start to-morrow, 25th, for Back's Biver."

   The " Becord " was then deposited again on the site of Sir James Boss's pillar,

where it was found by Lieutenant Hobson, on 6th May 1859, detached to search in

that direction by Captain McClintock. Belies of clothing, watches, plate, guns, &c.

were found along the beach, also the body of a young man ; the boat was found on

W.the beach in lat. 69° 9' N., long. 99° 27'   ; all of winch have often been described

before, and need not be repeated. No journals were found nor the ships seen. The

shore had not been visited by Esquimaux since the abandonment of the ' Erebus

and ' Terror.'

The whole of the coast of King William's Island was searched by McClintock,

while Allen Young examined Prince -of-Wales Land, and determined its insula-

rity by a laborious journey, filling up the intervening space between the points

reached by my parties in 1851.

Thus was successfully accomplished the object of this voyage, and the mystery

of the ill-fated expedition cleared up by the several searching expeditions for

Franklin's ships : the heroes had perished at the point of success.

Franklin died gloriously at his post, as did the old voyager Barentz on the

shores of Novaia Zemblia in 1596. The conclusions drawn from Bae's discoveries

were confirmed ; but the total disappearance of the ships remains unaccounted for.

After the important discoveries brought to geographical knowledge by the

Franklin Expedition and the North-west Passage were settled, a lull of interest

in Arctic research followed for a time ; it was revived again by Dr. J. L. Hayes, of

the United States, the companion of Kane, who returned to the scene of his

labours animated with an ambition for gaining the Pole. IBs expedition of 1860-61

point of land, in 81° 85' N., than had been reached by any previous navigator.

lie brought back valuable observations on the physical geography and hydrography

of this route into the unknown Polar Sea, with sanguine ideas of navigable waters

north of Greenland.

Then sprang up the rage for Polar exploration and emulation for reaching the

Pole itself. Captain C. F. Hall, of the United States, an enthusiast for discovery

in the north, who was famed for his two prolonged residences among the Esqui-

maux to inure himself to the climate, living, and privations of that northern race,

was single-minded, and devoted to the perils of Arctic life and discovery. Supported

by public feeling and the President of the United States, he was appointed to the

' Polaris,' for an expedition towards the Pole ; she was 387 tons, schooner-rigged,
and propelled by steam-power. In July 1871 Hall started for the north, visiting

the Danish settlements in Greenland, where dogs for sledging were procured. The

season was unusually favourable, which enabled the ' Polaris ' to enter Smith's
Sound with few obstacles, and reach the high latitude of 8lu 20' N. ; the naviga-

tion was persisted in, by struggling through formidable ice-floes, up to the high

position of 82° 11' N., and refuge was sought on the Greenland coast of the Robe-

son Strait, named Thank God Harbour, in lat. 81° 38' N., long. 61° 44' W. Here
the career of this devoted voyager was ended by his untimely death. He made a

reconnoitring journey in October, just at the approach of winter, in an

extreme low temperature : the severity of the climate and the exertion proved

too much for him ; on his return to the ' Polaris ' he was attacked with a severe

illness, and died in a few days. The death of Captain Hall was fatal to the object

of the expedition. To him is assigned the discovery of the Strait extending north-

ward from Kennedy Channel, and named by him Robeson Strait. The most

eventful crisis occurred in October 1872. During the drift of the ' Polaris ' out of

Smith's Sound, a severe nip in a gale threw the vessel on her beam ends

destruction was imminent ; the crew took to the floe of ice to save themselves.

Whilst in the operation of getting provisions out of the ship a disruption of the floe

took place ; suddenly the ' Polaris ' was drifted away a distance, leaving 19 souls on

the Hoe to their fate, exposed to the  rigour of an Arctic winter                                                                                     thus  at  daylight
                                                                                                                                                   ;

these unhappy people found themselves abandoned to their fate, with a very small

quantity of provisions and clothing, with slender materials to provide shelter, and

two boats. The chief officer of their party was Captain Tyson, and out of 19, 7

were Esquimaux. This awful separation happened near Lyttletou Island : influenced

by the southerly current the floe drifted away through the long dark Arctic

winter. The narrative of the privations and sufferings of these is unparalleled

how life was preserved seems miraculous, due entirely to the Esquimaux, who

were expert seal hunters. As they drew south of Davis Straits the floe reduced by

breaking away in a warmer sea, and they shifted about to different pieces of ice :
from day to day their condition became more hopeless. On the 30th April, in
lat. 53° 35' N., off Labrador, relief came to them jnst in time to save them from

starvation: the steamer ' Tigress,' employed in sealing, saved them.

The ' Polaris ' suffered so much damage from the nip, that she was driven on to

the coast to save her from sinking. After the ffoe party had disappeared, Captain

Buddington and 14 men were found onboard; the 'Polaris' was abandoned, and
the party passed the winter in a house of their own construction. In the spring

of 1 873 they took to their boats, and after many perils were picked up near Cape
York by the whaler ' Ravenscraig,' of Kirkcaldy.

Following upon the great discoveries so nobly made under the British flag by

naval officers in the Arctic seas northward of the American Continent, and the

failure of the United States Expedition to enter the Polar seas by way of Smith's

Bound, a strong feeling sprung up on the Continent to emulate our glorious feats
in the North, and under the advocacy of Dr. Petermann, the Swedes, Germans, and

Austrian.*, several expeditions have been conducted into the Spitsbergen seas and to
Novaia Zemblia since 18G5. Let us not omit to accord our praise to the spirited

yachtmen of this country, who have so nobly and ably encountered the perils of the

Polar seas, even to the north of Spitsbergen, in the cause of discovery, and returned

with valuable information. I refer to Lord Dufierin, Mr. Laniont, and Mr, Leigh

Smith ; after several voyages the two latter gentlemen hold to the opinion that the

nearest approach to the Pole lies in that direction.

On the east side of Greenland, the German Expedition of 1809-70, under Kolde-

wey, passed a winter in a small steamer of 140 tons, the ' Germania,' with a crew
of only 17 hands, on the same ground where our Captain Clavering, R.N., with

Captain Sabine, had conducted scientific pendulum observations in 1823, on Pendu-
lum Island, and laid down the coast from 72° to 76° N. Under Koldewey, Paver

won his first laurels as a traveller, in exploring deep fiords abounding in grand

scenery, with animal life, and an interesting flora. The 'Hansa,' tender to the
' Germania,' got separated from her before the winter in the packed ice. She was

drifted along by the prevailing current from the Polar Sea, along the east coast of

Greenland towards the south ; after many perils this vessel was crushed ; the crew

escaped in open boats to the Danish settlement near Cape Farewell. Professor
Nordenskiold has made several successful expeditions to Spitzbergen on scientific

pursuits, which are of the highest value.

Then we have to recognize the Austro-Hungarian Expedition under Weyprecht

and Payer, who set off to enter the Polar Sea to the north-east, acting on the views

of Petermann respecting the extension of the warm current from the Atlantic in

that direction                                                                 but at first starting from  the  north  coast  of  Novaia Zemblia their
                                                                            ;

small vessel was beset, and drifted in a helpless condition for more than a year in

the frozen sea, and they involuntarily became the discoverers of Franz-Josef Land

and adjacent islands, a group very similar to Spitzbergen. The feat accomplished by
Payer in exploring on foot to the north of these islands is unsurpassed. The

account of this celebrated voyage is familiar to you all, as well as their remarkable

escape from their abandoned ship.

   England could no longer look on idly and see other nations striving to eclipse
her Arctic fame, and repeated applications from the Royal Geographical and

other learned societies, also supported by this Association, resulted in Govern-
ment granting the Expedition which has so recently been conducted with so much
credit under Capt. Sir George Nares, seconded by Capt. Stephenson. It would be
tedious to you now, and indecorous of me, to repeat all what Captain Nares and
his noble followers have so gallantly accomplished, and which has been so fully and
prominently related to the world. You must bear in mind that although we male
such extensive discoveries in the search for Franklin, discovery was not then the
object, and since the celebrated effort of Parry to reach the Pole from Spitzbergen
in 1827, when he attained the high latitude of 82° 45' N., no further attempt to
explore the Polar seas had been sent forth. Smith's Sound was selected on the

opinion of a majority of Arctic officers, grounded chiefly on the statements received

from the United States Expedition respecting land trending north from Robeson
Channel, with facilities for navigation in the summer.

The 'Alert ' and the ' Discovery ' set forth in May, 1875, with the unanimous

good wishes of the nation for success. The chief object in view was to reach the

Pole of our globe, to extend our geographical knowledge, and obtain scientific

observations. The expedition left most amply provided for the perilous service, and

in the passage through Baffin's Bay as far as Smith's Sound was highly

favoured with an open navigation, and on the 28th July they reached

Port Foulke at the entrance of Smith's Sound. Here commenced the

trials  and impediments which                                                  the Arctic seaman has to contend with                                                                                                                                                                                  the  rest of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

the navigation season was one repeated struggle amidst heavy ice-fii tee icebero-s

sometimes for days beset in packed ice. The ships were advanced through Kennedy

Straits to the Robeson Channel of " Hall of the Polaris." The condition of the

navigation this season proved very different, as the ' Polaris' reached lat. 82° in

comparatively open water. On August 25th the ' Discovery ' was placed in a

harbour well suited for wintering and most favourably placed as the reserve station

should disaster happen to the ' Alert ' in a high latitude of the circumpolar sea.

The 'Alert' then advanced alone, contending against currents and massive floe-ice.
On September 1st, aided by a south-west gale, a passage was opened which enabled

Nares to clear the Robeson Channel, and attain the latitude of 82° 24' N., the most

northerly position ever gained by any ship. He found himself confronting the

circumpolar sea, filled with packed ice, varying from 80 to 100 feet in thickness,

which arrested all hopes of advancing further north, and, what was a greater dis-

appointment, not a glimpse of land coidd be discerned northward. Struggling

amongst the formidable floe-bergs, a station was gained on the coast in lat. 82° 27

and under the protection of heavy grounded ice, the ' Alert ' was secured for the

winter. Thus was the British flag the first time carried into the circumpolar sea,

so aptly termed the Palteocrystic Sea. The ship had been navigated with a skill

and courage never surpassed, and advantage taken of every piece of open water

peared for 142 days, and a minimum temperature of 730, 7 below zero was

registered.

    In the spring of 1876 the sledge parties set forth on discovery and research

those from the ' Alert ' taking up the exploration of the coast to the north and

westward, and the great attempt towards the Pole over the Palseocrystic ice; to
the 'Discovery' was confided the exploration of Greenland to the north and east-

ward. Commander Markliam, after contending against obstacles in the way of
hummocky ice never encountered before, against which progress was impractic-

able, gained the latitude of 83° 20' N. ; to him remains the honour of leaving the

British flag in the most northern point ever attained by man. Lieutenant Pelham
Aldrich succeeded in making 220 miles to the westward of the ' Alert's ' winter

   Thus the geographical results of this voyage are about 400 miles on the coast of

this circumpolar sea, which has been discovered and accurately laid down, with all
the physical features and productions of the country described. Besides these

leading parties, others were employed in surveying many detailed parts of the

shores and inlets of the Robeson Channel. I would observe that all hopes of gain-
ing access to the Pole ended when the Palseocrystic sea was entered, and no land visible
to the north. The two essential conditions were wanting for success, viz., a coast-
line trending north and ice suitable for sledge travelling, neither of which existed.

   Many valuable scientific observations have been made, and from which much

benefit will be gained to science ; these are in course of publication.

As an Arctic voyager, I may be permitted to express my unqualified approval of

the conduct of Captain Nares in his wise decision to return home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   in fact, nothing

could have been gained by remaining out another season, and the able seamanship

displayed in effecting the escape from such a perilous position is admirable;

for, remember, that in the three previous expeditions into this dangerous

channel Kane and Hall met with disaster, and Hayes can hardly be said to have

penetrated Smith's Sound in his schooner.

Before quitting these glacial regions, I would venture to give my opinion with

reference to future exploration. I never was sanguine as to the success generally

expected by the advocates of the Smith Sound route. By the valuable information

brought home by Nares as to the physical conditions of the Palaeocrystic ice, which

I believe to occupy all the circumpolar area within the eighty-third parallel, all

ideas of reaching the Pole from that direction, or anywhere north of the Parry

group, may be discarded                                                                                                                  and I thing this formidable "ice will  arrest                                                                                                                             the  voyager

sooner or later in navigating towards the Pole. But, instead of nations racing

for the Pole, let us accomplish what is practicable. To complete the coast-line of

North Greenland would be interesting to all geographers (that is, to connect the

coast between Beaumont's furthest and Koklewey's north limit of discovery at Cape

ABismarck), and might be accomplished from a Winter station on the east coast.

scientific survey of Franz-Josef Land would be of great service to the interests of

science. Payer observed a navigable sea from his extreme north position at Cape

Fligeley, between him and Oscar Land ; research in that direction appears to hold

outa hope of success in finding more land in that region. The Swedes are pre-

paring an expedition to make a passage from Novaia Zemblia along the Siberian
--136 report 1877.

coast to Behring Straits. In conclusion, all must admit that England retains the
proud distinction of being the foremost nation in polar research ; and if Nares did not
reach the Pole, his voyage has contributed largely to the sum of human knowledge.

Within the period now under review, ocean telegraphy has been developed by

means of  a  cable reposing on the bed of the  ocean                          we converse, as it were, with
                                                                           ;

our neighbours across the Atlantic, and our colonies at the Antipodes. In 1841

the Atlantic Ocean had not been fathomed ; we are now contouring the bed of the

ocean. I well remember the interest exhibited at this port in 1858, when the

United States frigate ' Niagara ' and our own ' Agamemnon ' departed to lay down

--the first cable from Valentia to Newfoundland. The mode of operation on that

occasion was the two met in mid-Atlantic, the cable was spliced and lowered to the

bottom, then each ship proceeded paying out the cable as she went towards America

and to Ireland. After three failures the cable was laid ; the joy was great; the
Queen and President Buchanan interchanged messages, but the joy was of short

duration. The cable spoke for twenty-five days, and in that time 4359 words

passed between the continents ; it then became weak in voice, and on September

1st ceased to speak altogether, though the cause of its silence was never ascer-

tained. In 1805 a new cable was manufactured and the 'Great Eastern,' carrying

24,000 tons and drawing 33J feet of water, was chartered to convey it. After
1200 miles had been laid, disaster occurred, and the ' Great Eastern ' returned

home with half the cable, the other half being at the bottom of the Atlantic. In

1866 the ' Great Eastern ' again started, and this time complete success was

achieved ; the new line was laid from Ireland to Newfoundland, and the wonder-
ful feat accomplished of fishing up the broken half from a depth of more than two

miles of water. Again congratulatory messages passed between England and

America, and since then the working of the cable has been entirely satisfactory.

Following on this achievement, the naturalist, geologist, and the physicist

became eager to obtain evidences concerning the condition of our globe at these

hidden depths, which form data for investigating the theories of oceanic physics

and the system of ocean circulation. This desire culminated in the ' Challenger '

Expedition under Nares, and a scientific corps under the direction of Sir Wyville

Thomson. Captain Evans, R.N., Hydrographer of the Admiralty, in his address

last year to this Section, demonstrated the position of the science known as the

'Physical Geography of the Sea,' up to the completion of the ' Challenger' Ex-

pedition ; I will now do no more than review the work accomplished during that

interesting voyage.

The ' Challenger ' Expedition, complete with every appliance and equipment

requisite for the investigation of the ocean depths, sailed from Portsmouth on

December 21st, 1872 ; she crossed the Atlantic three times, namely, between the
Canaries and Virgin Islands, between Bermuda and the Azores, and between the

main coasls of Sierra Leone and San Roque, and also examined an axial stretch of

the ocean basin from Halifax to the Virgin Islands. The expedition next visited

Bahia and Tristan d'Acunha, and was at the Cape in December 1873, one year of

the cruise being thus devoted to the examination of the Atlantic. The ' Chal-

lenger ' next proceeded from the Cape to Kerguelen Island, and investigated its

suitability as an observing station for the approaching transit of Venus, explored

the high southern latitudes between the 80th and 100th meridian of west longitude,

and from those shaped its course across the South Sea for Melbourne and New
Zealand, which was visited at the beginning of July 1873. From New Zealand

the course was laid by the Fiji Islands, Bass's Straits, and the Philippines to

Hong Kong, which was attained at the end of 1873. In this part of the expedi-

tion the Bandas, Celebes, and Sulu seas were examined and were found to be

curious submarine basins, circumscribed by runs of comparatively shallow water.

From Hong Kong, Captain Thompson, who had there superseded Captain Nares

upon his appointment to the command of the North Polar Expedition, returned to

the Philippines, and thence passed to the north coast of New Guinea, and from it

to Japan, where the Expedition was reported to be in the month of April 1875.
From Japan the ' Challenger ' crossed the Pacific to the 155th west meridian, then

passed directly south along the middle line of the ocean for eighty degrees of
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.               137

latitude, taking the Sandwich and Society Islands by the way, and afterwards turned

east across the remaining half of the Pacific, reaching Valparaiso at the end of

November 1875. The Straits of Magellan were traversed during the first days of thfe

year 1876, and the expedition was at Monte Video on the 25th of February, at the

Cape-Verde Islands on the 20th of April, and at Spithead on the 24th of May 1870.
  By this memorable expedition, Dr. Carpenter's views of the vertical circulation

of the ocean were substantially confirmed. It was found that the old idea of a

uniform deep-sea temperature of 39° was an error, which had been caused by the

derangement of the readings of the old unguarded thermometers under the pressure

of the water of the deep sea, and that a temperature of 32° prevails at deep ocean

bottoms, even at the equator, the cold there being due to a constant underflow of

dense water from the Polar seas towards the equator. But wherever the deep

basins are protected from the cold lower currents by comparatively elevated ridges

of rock, the deep soundings give warm water in the place of cold. This was

remarkably instanced in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the ridge-protected basins of

the Banda, Celebes, and Sulu seas. The temperature was found to be 50° at

1800 fathoms in the Sulu Sea, although in the neighbouring open China Sea it

was 37° at only 900 fathoms. In the Celebes Sea the temperature was 384° at

2007 fathoms.                  ·

               _

                                  <
In the Atlantic the very interesting fact has been determined by the ' Challenger'

soundings that the basin of the ocean is divided into two subordinate troughs by a

submarine ridge running from south to north through the Dolphin Rise and the

Azores, to the shallow water which bounds the Atlantic to the north. The average

depth of the Atlantic seems to be within 2640 fathoms, or three miles. The

deepest sounding in the Atlantic was in a depression lying 100 miles north of St.

Thomas, where the bottom was reached at 3800 fathoms, or four and a quarter

miles. The deepest sounding in the Pacific was midway between New Guinea and

Japan, in 11° N. and 143° E., where the bottom was reached at a depth of 4475

fathoms, or 453 feet more than five miles. Very near to this the temperature of

the deep sea was found to be 33 0, 9. In this deepest sounding one of the thermo-

meters was broken, but red clay was brought up from the bottom. Throughout

the long examination of the ocean depths by the ' Challenger/ the conclusion was

amply confirmed that there is animal life at all depths.

Maritime meterology, which has resolved itself into a distinct subject of investi-

gation, and is being conducted in this country under the direction of Mr. Robert H.

Scott, F.R.S., and the Meteorological Committee, will be productive of useful and

practical service in navigation. International Conferences were organized at

Brussels in 1859, when suggestions for a uniform system of meteorological observa-

tions at sea were adopted for observance by the navies and mercantile marine of all

nations. The patient and laborious collating from the returns and logs of ships

made by Admiral Fitzroy have produced those descriptive ' Tract Charts ' and

Pilot Charts which tend to curtail the length of voyages and avoid disaster

and under Admiral Richards, Hydrographer of the Admiralty in 1868 and 1872,

there was published a work containing a set of Charts showing the winds and

currents of the oceans on the surface of the globe, which has been highly valued
Aas a work of reference by the navigator.
                                           journal is published by the Meteoro-

logical Committee, which elaborately discusses all the materials collected on the

subject of ocean meteorology.

We must now direct our attention to the gTeat continent of Africa, where the

obstacles to be overcome by the traveller are very different from those enumerated

in the Arctic wastes, but are scarcely less terrible to encounter. Again referring

to the year 1841, speculations were then rife as to the sources of the Nile, the

region of tropical lakes was unexplored, and the whole river-system imperfectly

known. In place of desert in the interior high lands with fertility and a climate suited

to Europeans has been found. To enter into the marvellous extent of work accom-

plished by all the distinguished travellers, from the early days of Livingstone

to the last feat of Cameron, could not be compressed into this Address.

   In 1845 we find Mr. Murchison, in one of his early addresses, observe, " Indeed

it woidd be difficult to instance any part of this world whose streams have given

rise to greater diversity of opinion respecting their course ; thus, upon the whole,

we have a most limited knowledge of Africa, and that little confined almost
exclusively to the coast ; in the interior we are nearly as ignorant as we ever
were." But this ignorance did not last long. Very soon after this time we find

Livingstone crossing Africa from Loanda on the Atlantic to Quillimane, near the
mouth of the Zamhesi, exploring the Lakes of Nyami and the Nyassa, discovering
the grand and maiestic Victoria Falls, rivalled only by the Niagara. Then come
 in rapid succession those giants of travel, Burton, Speke, Grant, Baker, and Barth,
 &c, unveiling to the civilized world the hidden mystery of all historic time, that great

--equatorial system, Victoria Nyanza, Albert Nyanza,*Tanganyika inland seas and

 head-waters of the great Nile. In 1840 Barth, Overweg, and Richardson travelled
 the desert of Sahara to Timbuctu, and navigated the Lake Chadd, studded with its

 hundred islands. Almost simultaneously we observe that Rebmann, Krapf, and
 Van der Deeken start from Mombaz on the east coast in 4° S., and discover the

 snow-clad mountains of Kilimanjaro and Kenia, which rise to 22,000 feet high
 between Victoria Nyanza and the Indian Ocean, and are capped with perpetual
 snow. Of late years the heart of Africa has been traversed by those highly gifted

 travellers Nachtigal and Schweinfurth, who have collected such ample information

 on the ethnology, botany, and natural products of vast interior regions previously

 unexplored.

     Livingstone's last work of enduring toil, after he left England in 1866, was the
 discovery of the lakes Moero and Banguelo, and following the watercourse of the
 Lualaba northward to Nyangwe\ Previous to his death he had recrossed the

 Tanganyika to Ujiji, where he was met by the noble traveller Stanley, who had

 generously gone to succour him ; but the worn-out traveller and missionary dis-
 dained to leave his work, and returned to the heart of his new discoveries to end
 his days. Thanks be to Stanley throughout this land for bringing home to us the
 last tidings of the great African traveller. Upon the death of Livingstone the

  public feeling of this country to civilize the African and to develop the productions
  of the country greatly increased. Under Stanley, Gordon, and Cameron, the great
 achievement has been attained of navigating the three great lakes. To Colonel
 Gordon is due the honour of placing a steamboat on the Albert Nyanza, com-

 pleting the work which the gallant Baker, the discoverer of the lake, had so much

  at heart.

     But last of all let us accord our tribute of praise to the young naval officer,

 Lieutenant Cameron, for his marvellous journey, as being the first European who

  has ever crossed tropical Africa from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, a distance

  of about 3000 miles, 1200 of which was over new ground never before trodden by
  white man. The geographical results are highly valuable. He made a survey
  alone of the southern hall of Lake Taganyika, and gave it a true position, fixing its
  level at 2710 feet above the sea. From its western shore he discovered an outlet,
  the Luku<ra. From Lake Tanganyika he plunged into the heart of Africa, nothing

  daunted by sickness or danger, and without friend or white companion he fol-
  lowed upon the track of Livingstone to Nyangwe, the last place visited by that
  great traveller, a town on the Lualaba, which he found to be 1400 feet above the

  sea, making it 500 feet below Gondokoro, thus setting at rest the idea that the
  Lualaba was connected with the Nile. From Nyangwe Cameron embarked on the
  Lualaba, a broad and rapid river flowing westward, in full hope that it woidd
  prove to be the Congo ; unhappily a hostile chief denied him a passage through
  his country. Then he directed his steps southward to the capital of Kisongo,
  whence he discovered that the head-waters of the Lualaba are formed by a system
   of lakes. After a most adventurous journey under the guidance of an atrocious

  slave-dealer, who subjected him to many tedious delays and hardships, he reached
  the shores of the Atlantic near Benguela. On this route he defined the parting water-

   shed between the basin of the Lualaba and the tributaries of the river Zambesi.

  Cameron carried on a complete series of hypsometrical measurements across the con-

  tinent from Bagamoyo to Benguela, a work of great value, showing at a glance a sec-

   tion of south tropical Africa from ocean to ocean. Another naval officer, Mr. E. D.

  Young, has also earned distinction as a traveller by exploring the Lake Nyassa,

   which he found to extend 100 miles further north than Dr. Livingstone had
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                      139

imagined. This officer had rendered good service in a former expedition, when be

placed a screw launch on the Nyassa, and set at rest the villanous report of

Livingstone's murder. Under the light of this brilliant series of explorations,

tropical Africa appears to be a system of great inland lakes and rivers, which it

may be boped will end in forming the main trade-routes by which the thickly

populated interior will be reached and civilized. The most interesting problem

now to solve will be to find the head-waters of the mighty Congo, and connect it

with the Atlantic. Schweinfurth, south-west of Khartoum, reached the parting

watershed of the Nile-basin tributaries, and discovered the sources of a river

trending into Central Africa, named the Ualle. Can it lead to the Shari dis-

charging into lake Chad, or will it prove to be the Ogowe or Ogowai, which dis-

charges into the Atlantic near the Gaboon river ? The large measure of success

which has attended our recent explorations in Africa is succeeded by a desire to

civilize the unhappy people, and free them from the horrors of barbarism and

slavery. Missions have been successfully planted on the Nyassa, and the Church

Missionary Society have commenced operations to construct a road into the

interior from Bagamoyo, and despatched a mission to be established on the Victoria

Nyanza.

I would here desire to call the attention of this Section to the international

effort initiated last autumn by His Majesty the King of the Belgians at a Congress

held in Brussels, attended by Sir Rutherford Alcock and Sir Henry Rawlinson,

and many other distinguished British geographers, for the purpose of organizing

means for the systematic and continuous exploration of Africa, and with a view

t 'i the interest of all civilized nations of the world in such a desirable object. One

result of the Congress has been that the Council of the Royal Geographical Society

of London have founded an African Exploration Fund, under the patronage of

H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, with an Executive Committee. This fund will be ap-

propriated to the scientific examination of Africa, with a view to the exploration of

regions yet unknown to civilized nations, and the attainment of accurate information

regarding the inhabitants and physical features of the country, in order to consider

the best routes for opening up Africa by peaceful means. Ihe Council have pre-

pared a circular, which will be issued amongst you, setting forth the course they
Aintend to take in this great movement, and the mode of raising funds.
                                                                            very

instructive map accompanies this circular, in which the lines of recent exploration

are laid down, and in which the unknown regions of the great continent are brought

under notice at a glance.

With regard to the continent of Asia, I will not attempt that which would be

merely a recapitulation of what has been laid before the world by that learned and

distinguished geographer, Sir Henry Rawlinson, and other eminent savants, who

have so ably summarized all the information from the laborious work so systema-

Wetically carried on by scientific surveyors under the Russian Government.  have

now full descriptions of the physical geography of all the countries under Russian

dominion, including hydrographical surveys of the inland seas and lakes in Asia.

The same applies also to the labours of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India

bounding our Indian Empire. It is very satisfactory to find that the Indian Go-

vernment have restored the Department of Marine Surveying in India practical
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

operations have already produced beneficial work in correcting old surveys on the

coasts of India and Burruah.

Madagascar has hitherto been little noticed by the civilized world, with the

exception of a trade supplying our holding of Mauritius with animal food ; but with

the intercourse now springing up in Eastern Africa, with the spread of colonization

northward of Natal, we may expect to see British enterprise seeking a field in this

large island. Madagascar has an extent of 818 geographical miles from north to

south, and a breadth of 301 miles in its widest part. Since 1870 the interior of this

island has been traversed and examined by the labours of Dr. Mullens; and other

intelligent missionaries have furnished valuable information regarding the physical

geography of the interior and the natives. The able paper of Dr. Mullens on the

Central Provinces is well worthy of attention : there is a magnificent country,
--140 REPORT 1877.

abounding in the necessaries of life, with a population bordering on 2,000,000, of

whom some 300,000 are reported to be under civilized influence and instruction

they are spoken of as a kindly, gentle, and capable race, ruled over by a Queen who

is herself a Christian and a devoted friend to the missionaries.

   But of all the wonderful changes effected by the mind of man and engineering

skill has been the separation of the connecting link between Asia and Africa, under
the genius and perseverance of Lesseps, in the construction of the Suez Canal.
Egypt lias ever been the land of wonders, and this mighty achievement bears com-
parison with the colossal works of the Pharaohs. The Suez Canal has a length of
i)9 miles, and was fully opened for traffic in 1869 ; in the first eight months of last
year 1009 vessels passed through the Canal, and the revenue dues amounted to

£811,000. The Mediterranean is no longer separated from the Red Sea by a neck

of land 72 miles wide, as the geography of our youth taught us.

   The late survey of the eastern end of New Guinea is an instance, among many

others, of countries lying contiguous to civilization which have never been surveyed

until recent date ; it is scarcely creditable to a great maritime nation to remain so

long ignorant of a coast within 80 miles of her own territories, and in the midst of

a region traversed in all directions by her commerce. New Guinea was first dis-

covered in 1526, by Don Jorge de Menezes ; it was partially examined by Dampier
and Cook, but the most important survey has been made by H.M.S. ' Basilisk,'

under Captain Moresby, from the eastern extremity of the island for 278 miles to
that part of the coast where D'Entrecasteaux's observations began. Captain Price

Blackwood and Owen Stanley gave some valuable information of the country within

range of the south portion of the coast which they surveyed. Missionaries and ex-
peditions of a commercial character from Australia have attempted to establish

settlements, but without success: the climate is pestilential, the interior impene-

trable, and the natives, who are of a degraded and barbarous condition, avoid

intercourse with us.

  A word on nomenclature. It is much to be regretted that voyagers and travellers

do not attempt to attach the native name to a locality wherever it can be obtained,
instead of fixing familiar names of our language in profusion over our new surveys.

   The rapid progress and development of America, since 1841, arising from the
discovery of auriferous deposits, the extension of the United States to the shores of

the Pacific, the peopling of California, with its agricultural wealth, have brought so

many discoveries from " Nature's mighty workshop " which it is impossible to enter
upon now. The colonization of Vancouver's Island has connected more firmly our
continuous dominion in the north from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The railway
constructed across the Isthmus of Panama, from Colon to Panama, defines a line of
demarcation between the two continents ; the railway was opened for traffic in

1855, and has been the means of avoiding the horrors of the old voyage round
Cape Horn, and brought the Pacific within a few days' voyage from Europe.

   The empire of Japan was, in 1841, a land of exclusion : a reversal of ideas has
pervaded this intelligent race, who now aspire to emidate Europeans in arts,
commerce, and civilization.

   Amongst the most instructive works which any traveller has ever produced upon
China should be specially cited " The Scientific Researches of the Baron Richt-
hofen "*, the important feature being the large extent of coal-field found by him
in the interior, which may be developed at some future day, and effect a wonderful
revolution in the habits, commerce, and intercourse of that singular and shrewd race
with the whole world.

   I cannot conclude without recognizing the marvellous services which the growth
of steam navigation has rendered to geographical science. About three years pre-
vious to the meeting of the British Association here in 1841, the first great achieve-
ment of ocean voyaging by steam was when the ' Great Western,' a ship of 1400

tons, steamed all the way from Bristol to New York in 15 days. In 1850, the screw

steamship ' Argo,' of 1850 tons, circiunnavigated the globe in 124 days ; in 1852,
the ' Australian ' steamed from Plymouth to Melbourne in 76 days. The levia-

 than ship, the 'Great Eastern,' of 18,000 tons burthen, was launched on the
Thames in 1859; though, as a commercial speculation, she was a failure, yet this
 wonderful ship was destined, as it would seem, providentially, to complete the
great work of laying down submarine telegraph-cables on the bed of the Atlantic,

which has brought the Old and New Worlds into instantaneous converse. The enor-

mous carrying powers of this ship, together with its great stability, facilitated most

materially the operation of laying out these cables in a direct course. It was about
the same year (18-41) that Wheatstone had the boldness to state before a Parlia-
mentary Committee his conviction that the Straits of Dover might be crossed by a

telegraph wire laid on the bed of the sea. There may be some present here who can

remember those early aspirations to the application of steam power and electricity,
and who can now reflect on the marvellous progress of these two invisible agents,

which have given to man the means of expanding his labour and profits in a three-

fold degree during his allotted probation here on earth.

   Having now briefly reviewed the leading discoveries which have so enlarged

our knowledge of this finite planet, chiefly by the enterprise and courage of this
nation, and accomplished by men whose names will for ever be enrolled on the

banner of fame, we may justly feel proud that the verdict of other nations accords

to us pre-eminence in Geographical research. It is satisfactory to perceive that
Geography has become a subject of general interest, and, as a science, is daily pro-
gressing and taking a more elevated position in the political as well as in the com-

mercial world. With a view to give greater encouragement to the study of Geo-
graphy in a more strictly scientific direction, the Council of the Royal Geographical

Society have provided means for ensuring a certain number of lectures during each

session from scientists of the highest order. Let us hope that our efforts on this

occasion may tend to increase that spirit for advancing Geographical knowledge

which has been so well exemplified in days past by the exploits of Drake, Raleigh,
and many other naval worthies from this county ; and, quoting from Cicero, I will

conclude with these words :
   " I speak of that learning which makes us acquainted with the boundless extent

of nature and the universe, and which, even while we remain in this world, dis-

covers to us both heaven, earth, and sea."

    On proposed Stations in Central Africa as Bases for future Exploration.
                         By Commander V. L. Cameron, R.N.

    After reviewing the remarkable journey of Dr. Livingstone on the Zambesi, and
other travels which had opened up the country during the past twenty years, the

authorsaid that in this matter the Old and New Worlds might well shake hands, for

Stanley's daring journeys were worthy of those of old-world travellers. Much still
remained to be done, and a step was taken last year by the King of the Belgians in

starting an international association for the exploration of Central and South Africa
but eventually this great association broke up, and it was found better to form an
entirely British organization which might work independently, but in friendly
relation to other efforts. The committee had selected routes starting from the east
coast as a basis of exploration. His opinion was that it would be better to establish

a direct line of stations to explore certain districts, not only for the purpose of map-
making, but for the extension of trade and commerce and the general influences of
civilization. In appointing persons to the command of these stations it would be

necessary to exercise great care, as they must be invested -with magisterial power.

At present the natives showed great inclination to gather for protection around any
settlement formed by merchants or slave-traders, who granted them immunity from

their warlike neighbours in order to obtain necessary supplies. If, instead of the

capricious rule of the slave-trader, the judicious rule of a British agent were esta-

blished, they would soon find thousands of natives settling round, and as their num-

bers increased, greater care would have to be exercised in dealing with them. It

was doubtful whether our Government would give their authority to such a system

as this ; and, if they should decline to do so, the next best thing would be to esta-

blish agencies under the sanction of the Sultan of Zanzibar. In proportion to the

work done, the excessive cost of travelling in Central Africa was more apparent

than real, whilst the country possessed enormous natural wealth at present almost

entirely undeveloped. The india-rubber trade was comparatively new. In the year

1875 the exports were worth £40,000, in 1876 they rose to £100,000, while this

year they were estimated at nearly a quarter of a million. The rise in this impor-

tant trade was entirely due to the enlightened efforts of his Highness Seyyid Bur-

ghash in suppressing the slave traffic in his dominions, the capital formerly used in

the slave-trade being now employed in this more legitimate commerce. Among

the other resources of the country were Indian corn and various other grains, the

export of which might form a most important food supply for the popvdation of

--India. Considering the famines in that country, it behoved us to open up such an

important resource the products of Central Africa being vastly in excess of the

native requirements. Apart from this great social question, it seemed that the

continent of Africa had been purposely kept until this time in its present condition

in order to supply the growing wants of the 19th and 20th centuries. He believed

the establishment of one or more great corporations, somewhat on the basis of the

Honourable East-India Company, although apparently the day for such great enter-
prises was past (the spirit of the age was against the granting of exclusive powers

to such bodies), woidd be the most efficacious means of bringing the centre of

Africa under the influences of trade and civilization. If from any cause the pro-

posed stations could not bo fixed, he would propose the opening up of a certain

district, which, having been thoroughly explored, missionaries, traders, &c. would
soon occupy, and thus form a basis for further exploration and settlement. All

petty jealousies must, however, be put aside, or the prestige of the white man would

be damaged. If the proposed stations were established they should be utilised as

centres for meteorological and other scientific observations. The more rapidly the
centre of Africa was opened up the more rapidly would the disgraceful traffic in
human flesh and blood be abolished. To the English this should be a work of
especial importance. Devon and the West country were justly proud of the
veterans and explorers of olden times, the Raleighs, Grenvilles, and others ; but it

could not be forgotten that there had been one who had sullied the British flag by

introducing the slave-trade, and that trade we, as Britons were therefore indi-

rectly responsible for. Thanks were due to the Khedive and the Sultan of Zanzibar,
and also to Dr. Kirk, his most able adviser, for the efforts which had been made to

put a stop to the traffic in the east of Africa, especially when it was remembered
that the Sultan of Zanzibar was acting against a strong opposition on the part of
members of his own family and other persons of influence with him. The syste-
matic exploration of Africa was a subject which now interested the whole world;
little Belgium, readily responding to her rider's call, had subscribed £12,000 for
sending out an expedition. Portugal had sent out an expedition at a cost of
£20,0U0, and other countries were giving attention to the matter. If we did not
take care Ave should have the fruits of our own efforts taken from us by more

enterprising neighbours. In this country, where all the finances of the Government

had to be submitted to the House of Commons, we could not expect the Govern-

ment to act so liberally as those of other  nations                               but this  should  stimulate  us  as
                                                                               ;

On Bashakard in Western Baluchistan. By Ernest A. Floyer.

The author made two prolonged journeys into the previously almost unknown

interior of this remarkable country, whilst engaged in constructing the line of tele-

graph to India which runs through Baluchistan from Persia. Although small in

area, Bashakard retains all the distinctiveness of a large country. It is so exces-

sively mountainous that no animals except the donkeys of the country can cany

loads in it. The paths are intricate and so little used by the sparse population that

strangers cannot find them. The access of the natives of the surrounding country

is thus, to a certain extent, barred                                                                                                                               and there is in the disposition of Bashakardis a
                                                                                                                                                                ;

mixture of pride and cowardice, added to intense ignorance, which makes them alow

to mix with strangers. The author went on to speak of the general grotesqueness

and barrenness of the huge crags which compose this district, and which take from

the oxides of iron and lead they contain almost every colour of the rainbow. The

remains of massive forts and extensive burying-grounds were described ; and the

Fauna of the country stated to consist chiefly of ibex, mountain sheep, bears, and

norcupines. The population was estimated at 2000, about half of whom are slaves.

i;t is, however, many years since any new slave blood has been introduced, and Mr.

Floyer was inclined to think that the ancestors of the present slaves did not come

from Africa ; for, though some of the men are very dark, he nowhere saw thick lips
Aor woolly hair.
                  wealthy Bashakardi, such as the governor of a province, has

about 100 slaves, a few of whom carry arms and remain near his person, while the

rest are distributed about in six or seven little mat villages, where they sow maize,

wheat, and beans, cultivate date-trees, and tend goats and a few small sheep. On

the least rumour of fighting or disturbance of any sort, they retire into some lofty

mountain fastness, where they have previously assured themselves of the existence

of water. The country is divided into six provinces, which are simply so many

--clusters or ranges of mountains. These are Marz to the north, Baroser (with the

capital) in the centre, Gavr and Parnrint to the east, Pizgh to the south, and

Jangda to the west. These provinces are each under a governor, all of whom till

recently submitted to a head chief at Anguhran, the capital. Seif Allah Khan,

however, the late rider, in pursuit of a blood-feud of long standing, shot down on
his own threshold four of the leading members of the family of Ghulani Abbas,

Governor of Baroser ; and this family having obtained help from the Persian Govern-

ment, which always keeps an eye on such matters, Seif Allah Khan was driven into

hiding, though his tribe were so powerful that he coidd not be dispossessed of his

extensive date-groves. After this the Governor of Kirman sent a tax-collector (one

sent some years before had been murdered), and, through the medium of the

Governor of Pizgh, whom the Persians promised to make head chief, they collected

about 200 tomans, being roughly three krans per head, from all the free population

who coidd be induced to pay. The vicinity of Anguhran is almost the only flat

space in the country. It is situated at the confluence of two huge torrent-beds, in

tlie fertile silt of which, walled up from the winter freshets, are thousands of very

superior date-trees. Here, as elsewhere, the only places available for cultivation

are the deposits of silt in the beds of torrents. The climate is almost like that of

land, though ratherwarmer ; lime-, orange-, and fig-trees are grown, and willow;

a kind of pepper and pomegranate-trees thrive. The peculiarity of the scanty vege-

tation of the hills themselves is the unusual abundance of powerfully-scented plants.

The general elevation of the country is 2000 feet, sloping down to the east and up

to the north. The only trade is the occasional export of Sunaiti, a small red wheat,

to Minab and dates to Jask, in return for which the inhabitants get salt, beads,

coarse powder, and salt fish, and a very little calico. They make and wear a very

coarse cotton cloth kilt and rope sandals of bruised palm-leaves ; their arms are

sword, shield, gun, and dagger. The Bashakard dialect is similar to that of the

Makran Baluch, describee! by Mr. Pierce in the 'Proceedings' of the Bombay

branch of the lloyal Asiatic .Society ; but it is more corrupt, and contains many

words the derivation of which Mr. Floyer could not ascertain.

                 On tlie Lower Course of the Brahmaputra or Tsanpo.
                         By Lieut.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen.

   The author gave his reasons for supposing that the great river Subansiri was the
outlet of the Tsanpo. Whilst engaged in the survey operations of 1875-6 in the
Dufla Hills, he could not, after looking north into the mountain region from the
two highest peaks then visited, avoid being impressed with this idea. From the
two peaks of Tornputu, 7300 ft., and Shengarh, 6700 ft., lying? on the high outer
ranges, the great main valleys on the north were well seen, and could be laid down
on the Plane Table with very considerable accuracy, even to very great distances,
as all the conspicuous peaks up to the snowy range and several of its summits
were intersected upon it. The finest view of this area was obtained from Shengarh,
where he was detained for several days by heavy rain. During this interval a
party of sappers and his Khasi coolies completely cleared the peak, which was
covered to the summit with grand forest growth, so that the view was unimpeded
in every direction on the bright clear day that rewarded their labour. Continuous
observation revealed the run of the main ranges and ridges and the position of the
deep valleys. The valley of the Subansiri was well traced, with its two main
branches ; one from the north-west, near lat. 28°, long. 93°, had its sources among
the high mass of snowy peaks (23,000 ft.), so well seen from the valley of Assam
 near Tezpur, while another deep depression in the mountains lies just east of long.
94°, and joins the first near lat. 27° 40'. The first of these the author took to be
the tributary crossed by the native explorer Nain Singh on his way into Tawang
 from Lhassa, and the other he believed might be the Tsanpo. Other considerations

--in support of this view were the following: 1, the temperature of the Lohit or

 Subansiri where it joins the Brahmaputra is lower than that of any other tributary
 of that river, this being especially noticeable during the rains, ?'. e. in June and July
 2, Mr. J. O. N. James, Assistant Surveyor-General, says it is borne out by the

 Revenue Survey Map of the District Sakluinpur, into which the Subansiri enters

 after leaving the hills ; 3, Lieut. Ilarman, R.E., after seeing the Dihong at its
junction with the eastern branch of the Brahmaputra near Sudiya, considers the
 Subansiri to have the largest body of water ; \. the Pundit Nain Singh could

 trace the Tsanpo, where he crossed it, for thirty miles east, and thence it flowed
 south-easterly, which would take it towards the great valley observed by the author
 and 5, the hill people, on being questioned by Lieut. Harman, gave evidence which
 tended to show that the Subansiri and Tsanpo are the same, and that the Dihong

 is not the Tsanpo, as geographers at present generally believe.

               On the Miner Kingani in East Africa.

By F. Hoimwood, Assistant Political Resident at Zanzibar.

This river, which was thoroughly examined by the author in July 1876,

disembogues opposite the island of Zanzibar, and was long classed as one of those

hopeful-looking rivers which it was trusted might become highways to the interior

but, like the Bovuma, the Wami, and others, it has been found, though not abso-

lutely unnavigable, not to fulfil the expectations excited by the appearance and

extent of its waters. The author ascended the stream in the Church Missionary

Society's yacht for 120 miles. Its lower course was found to be broad and shallow

its waters in this part inundating the adjoining flat country during the rains, and

giving rise to the virulent swamp fever, which desolates the coast region in the

neighbourhood of Bagamoyo during the greater part of the year. In ascending the

river the average depth for the first 20 miles was found to be 18 feet, shallowing

to 12 feet for 10 miles further. Its breadth averages 200 yards up to the first ferry

(Kivuko) and 150 yards up to Kingwere ferry. Beyond the latter point hippopo-

tami abound, and the width of the stream contracts to 70 yards, the navigation

being also obstructed by snags and sunken trees, which leave only narrow passages,

through which the water rushes like a sluice. The banks in the lower part are

inhabited by the coast Suahili people                                                                                                                                            beyond the district of Uzaramo commences,

and the country becomes hilly, This continues for several miles, and then a -wilder

country is reached, where t he important tributary, the Lungerengere, joins the

main stream. The banks here abound in game, and gnu, waterbuck, buffalo, and

rhinoceros are plentiful. The position of the mouth was lixed by Mr. Mackay, a
member of the Expedition, by observation, at 7°0' 89" S. lat. and 38° 28' E. long.

The Lungerengere was only 20 feet in breadth and two feet in depth, but it is not
Aso tortuous as the Kingani.
                              few miles beyond this the main stream proved

no longer navigable. It was 25 to 40 yards wide, and about 8 deep in the

channel ; but the obstructions in the deep water became so numerous that the
author decided on returning. Beyond the junction of the Lungerengere the

Kingani is called the Mpezi ; the natives persisted in declaring it to be a separate

river, and could not be made to understand any civilized notions on the subject,
a circumstance which shows how untrustworthy must be all African geography
founded on the reports of natives. The result of the exploration was the con-

viction that the Kingani, as a navigable river, is practically useless.

             On a Visit to the Mungao District in East Africa in 1870.
              By Dr. J. Kirk, H.B.M. Political Resident at Zanzibar.

   The Mungao district is the most southerly division of the Sultan of Zanzibar's

dominions, and extends along one hundred miles of coast from Kiswere, in S. lat.
0° 2-)', to the small stream that forms the limit of the Sultan's territory in the
Bay of Tungi, at Cape Delgado. Previous to the survey carried on by Capt. Gray,

of II. M.S. Nassau, in 1875, little was known of the different harbours of this part
of the coast, and before 1870 the trade of Mungao consisted of a little copal,
orchilla-weed, and cowries, but principally of slaves that came from the Nyassa
lake. During the prevalence of southerly winds slaves were sent to Zanzibar,
Somali-land, and Arabia ; when the monsoon changed, Arab vessels transported
slaves to the Comoro Islands and Madagascar. So late as December, 1873, Vice-

--Consid Elton described the condition in which he found the Mungao district as

follows : " Trade is at a stand-still ; copal-digging is entirely stopped, the diggers

being sold as slaves when on their way to the coast.'' Since then, Mungao had
not been revisited until Dr. Kirk's southerly cruise, and he was much gratified

at the improvement witnessed in the social condition of the people as the result

of one year's cessation of the slave-trade under decree of the Sultan. He found

that throughout the whole district the slave-trade was really at an end. The
principal chief who carried on the wars for slaving purposes that depopulated tho
district so late as 1873 had become settled and industrious, and a commerce had
sprung up that in one year had reconciled the people of Mungao to the new stato

--of things, and opened up to them a new source of wealth one which was wholly

incompatible with wars and slave-trade. Last year the export of India-rubber

from the Mungao district, under this new state of things, was 1,400,000 lb., which
represents approximately £90,000 value. In this new industry the chief Machemba
and his people, who before were the scourge of the district, had taken the lead.
But there are also many other sources of wealth for the region is suitable for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

agriculture, and abounds in copal, cowries, orchilla-weed, ebony-wood, calumba-
root, and dye-woods ; while inland there is coal of good serviceable quality, and

iron in abundance. Wherever Dr. Kirk came in contact writh the people, he was
glad to find the want of labour generally felt and acknowledged, and to meet with
no sign of the slave-trade, the Nyassa caravans now passing by a direct route in-
land, and not through Mungao, as before. The plans and charts of this coast
lately published by the Admiralty showed that it abounds with spacious har-

bours, some of which are land-locked, with deep approaches, and capable of
receiving the whole British fleet. The chief of them are Kiswere, Mehinga, Lindi,

Mwania, Mtwara, and Mikindani. Any one of these places would afford a good

station as basis for operations under the scheme set on foot by the King of the
Belgians ; but it would be necessary to ascertain which of them were free from the
tsetse-fly, the presence of which would render impossible the use of bullocks for

land carriage. Dr. Kirk found the fly dangerously prevalent in several of the best
localities. It is not known, however, to exist at Lindi, which on this account
could be recommended as the most suitable station and starting-point for the

interior.

     On the Line of Levels run from the Mediterranean to the Sea of Galilee.
                                By Lieut. Kitchener, H.E.

    The levelling was commenced in June, 1875, under the direction of Lieut.
Conder, R.C., but was interrupted a few weeks afterwards by an unfortunate dis-
turbance at Safed, which for a time put an end to all survey operations in
Palestine. The work was taken up again in March, 1877, under circumstances of
some difficulty, and carried to a successful conclusion by Lieut. Kitchener. There
had been no opportunity at present of examining the field-books and applying any
corrections which might be necessary ; but the reporter thought it might be stated
that the line of levels, 86£ miles, was run with two instruments, a 10" spirit-level
and a 7" thedolite, read by independent observers, and that the result gave the
Sea of Galilee a depression of 682 544 feet. The fine of levels has been marked
by 31 bench-marks, cut on the rock or on solid masonry in places where they
are not likely to be destroyed by the natives, and the positions of the bench-
marks have been fixed and laid down on the 1-inch map of Palestine which is
being constructed by a party of Royal Engineers, under the auspices of the Pales-
tine Exploration Fund. The levelling commenced on the shores of the Mediter-
ranean at Haifa, and was carried thence across the Akka plain, past the villages
of Jidru, Kefr Etta, and El Mejdel; from the last-mentioned place it was con-

tinued up the Wady el Melek, along the southern side of the plain of the But-
tauf, and over the ridge to the Wady el Hamam, down which it proceeded, and,

passing through a great gorge between cliffs over 1030 feet high, was carried

over the plain to its termination at the edge of the sea.

                      On the German Expedition to Western Siberia.

                                     By Dr. 0. Finsch.

    The object of the expedition was to explore the isthmus which separates the
river Obi, near Obdorsk, from Kara Bay. The expeditionary party consisted of
Dr. Finsch, Count Waldburgzeil, and Dr. Brehrn. On their outward journey from
Moscow they made a long detour southward towards the Altai before descending
the Obi, passing through Kasan, Ekaterinburg, and Tjumen to Tobolsk ; thence,
crossing the Irtish on the ice (in early April), to Omsk, Semipalatinsk, and Lake
Zaisan. Turning to the northward they travelled via Barnaul to Tomsk, and em-
barked on the Obi, at the latter place, for Samarow, where a lotka or decked boat,
propelled chiefly by oars, was placed at their disposal for the work of exploration.
Nine days on board this craft brought them to Obdorsk, whence they proceeded
to ascend the Chuya, a considerable tributary which drains the eastern side of the
isthmus, and seemed to hold out promise of a navigable route over a considerable
portion of the interval separating the navigable waters of the great river from the
Arctic Ocean, at a point accessible by trading ships from Western Europe. The
object of the expedition (which was preceded in the same month by a Russian
party having the same mission) was to ascend this river as far as practicable, and
thence find the nearest and best road, by river as it was hoped, to the sea at
Kara Bay- The navigation of the Obi downward from Obdorsk was exciting,
owing to the immense waves of the giant river, which so terrified the native
crew that they would gladly have returned had they not been bound by contract.
The vessel kept close under the right bank, which presented high steep walls of
clay or sand, the opposite (left) bank being low and fringed with forest, beyond
which rise in picturesque beauty the snow-covered summits of the Ural mountains.
Their first halting-place was Knidski-Yursti, a station composed of six Ostiak
houses constructed of timber, and the chief residence of the venerable Ostiak

prince, Iwan Teisciu. The reindeer herd of the prince had been reduced from

7000 in number to 700 through the rinderpest, which had caused great havoc

amongst these valuable animals. Continuing their voyage the}' reached Kiochat,

an important fishing-station                                                                                                                                      here  were seen block-houses, huts built of twigs

and turf, pointed tents or wigwams, called Jmns, constructed of birch-bark, nets

spread out to dry, fishing-tackle in great variety, and the varied people engaged

--in the fishery Russians, Siranes, Ostiaks, Samoiedes, with their women, children,
--and dogs, forming a scene of great animation in the midst of these northern

solitudes. The boldness of the sea-gulls amused them greatly, flying about in

numbers, and with hoarse screechings trying to rob the fishermen of their booty

out of their very nets. From Kiochat they crossed the great Obi, and entered upon

the tranquil waters of the small Obi, which at that season formed a perfect

labyrinth of channels swollen by inundation, which rendered it difficult to map

its course. The channels are bordered on both sides by tall willows. Here, as

everywhere on their river voyage, the gnats proved a terrible annoyance, owing to

their immense numbers and blood-thirstiness. Fishing-stations were met with on

the lesser Obi at tolerably regular intervals of about ten miles. On the 18th of

July they arrived at a station near the western mouth of the Chuya, but were

unable to obtain any information as to the course of the river from the natives

residing there.

They continued their journey down the Obi until they reached, at Yanburri, the

eastern mouth of the Chuya. Yanburri is the last fishing-station on the Obi. All
these stations are tenanted only in the summer months, from June to the middle

of September. None of them are permanent, and the names marked as such on
maps are only misleading. Ascending the Chuya they found the banks presenting
the character of tundras. At a native village on the river they procured two

guides, one an Ostiak, the other a Samoiede, and proceeded onward to the Sort-

johan-jokort, or bifurcation, where they arrived on the 20th. After four days'

further travelling they reached Junshi, a settlement of the Ostiaks, from the head-

man of which, who had lived here for four years, they obtained some valuable
information regarding the stream. He told them the waters would soon begin

to subside, and that their vessel would be unable to proceed on account of the

shallows and sandbanks. They had not yet reached the northern limit of the

growth of trees ; on the contrary, the larch still flourished, and the low flat districts
were covered in places with an impenetrable growth of willows and alders. The

river itself is excessively tortuous, the bends being very numerous and so abrupt

that at the end of a day's journey they were not out of sight of their starting-

place of the morning. On the 25th the country became more hilly and the river

narrower and shallower, and on the following day they reached the limits of navi-
gation. The further journey was continued by land towards the Podarata. Trees

were now no longer met with, and a desolate tundra was entered upon, the sur-
   e of which was covered with moss and the small dwarf birch. On the 80th

they reached the camp of an Ostiak chief, whose reindeer herd had been reduced

from 2000 head to 500 by the terrible rinderpest, which threatens to destroy the

whole of the reindeer in Northern Siberia and thus deprive the inhabitants of almost
their only means of subsistence. The party saw on the day of their arrival eighty

fine animal animals lying dead near the native huts, and thirty more died before the
next morning. The chief ceded nine reindeer and three sledges to enable the party

to continue their journey over the monotonous tundra, which was here and there
varied with pools and bogs, forcing them to make long detours. Animal life was
not very varied, the lemming, gulls of two species, the golden plover, and the ptar-

migan being the chief species met with. On the 2nd they sighted the waters of

Kara Bay, and in the evening arrived on the banks of the Podarata, which flows into
the bay. It had been hoped that this river woidd prove navigable for a considerable

distance, so that a portage of moderate length to the Chuya might only be required

ineffectual. From a look-out on an eminence they saw before them a vast swampy

plain, reaching to the sea, intersected by rivulets and bounded on the west by the

by a long detour. The Podarata seemed to lose itself in the wilderness of swamps
before reaching the bay. Provisions failed, and the natives refused to go any
further, and so they resolved to return.

    Nor was the Russian Expedition more successful. Returning south, the German

--party skirted the low, bare, granitic range of Yangana-pei a spur of the Urals.

These elevations, and the hills which traverse the mossy tundras, proved to the party
the utter impossibility of the suggested canal across the isthmus. Moreover, the
long winter, the soil thawing hardly more than two feet in depth during the summer,
and the unnavigability of the two rivers, which swell rapidly, like mountain torrents,
after every rainfall, and flow in such tortuous courses, seem to forbid the realization

--of the scheme. The portage between the Chuya and the Podarata was found to be

forty-seven miles much longer than had been estimated. The party reached Ob-

dorsk on their return on the 19th of August, and finally quitted it en route for
Europe on the 3rd of September.

 On a Journey overland to India in 1872, via Meshed, Herat, Candahar, and

          the Boulan Pass. By Capt. H. C. Marsh {Bengal Cavalry).

   The chief interest of this paper lay in the description which the author gave of the
scenery and people of the region he travelled through and the manner in which he was
received by the civil and military authorities of Afghanistan, who treated him as a

British officer, although travelling in his private capacity. He was well received

and kindly entertained at Herat and Candahar, but was refused entry into Cabul on
account of his not having the required permission to travel from his own Govern-
ment, and was compelled to take the lower road into India rid Quetta, Kelat, and
the Boulan Pass. It was with great difficulty he was able to find guides to conduct

him through the pass, owing to the fear of the robber tribes who infest it ; and,

having at length engaged one native courageous enough to undertake the task, he
completed the journey unmolested, by a hurried inarch of forty miles without

stopping.

             From Guayaquil to the Napo by the Upper Patassa Route.

                                   By Alfred Simson.

   That part of the author's journey lying between the rivers Pastassa and the

Napo had never, as far as is known, been before traversed by a European. He began

his journey by crossing the Andes by the little-frequented Tachuelo Pass, which
lies to the south of the Arenal, the usual route followed in going to Quito and the
Napo. The summit of the pass, 14,000 feet above the sea-level, is a small breach in
a ridge, or wall, of solid bare rock, access to which is attained by a breakneck path
winding over loose porphyry debris. The descent on the eastern side is also fear-
fully rough, the toilsome day's journey terminating at the town of Cajabamba.
The road thence passes through Riobamba, and along the ledge of the Chambo
valley, and across the torrent of the same to Banos on the Pastassa. This remote
village is built at an elevation of 5204 feet above the sea-level, and enjoys a mean
annual temperature of G3f ° Fahr. It lies in a cauldron-shaped valley, enclosed by
the steepest mountains, the only outlets from which are the narrow gorges of the
river. At night one cannot get rid of the depressing sensation of being at the
bottom of a well, surrounded by high walls, with the sky only visible overhead.
From Bafios Mr. Simson started, with sixteen Indian porters, for Santa Inez, by
unfrequented paths through dense forests drenched by almost continual rains, where
landslips down the mountain-sides often carry away all traces of the solitary track.
Below Santa Inez several tributary streams, descending from the Andes, fall into

Pastassa, and present great obstacles to the traveller, being unfordable and liable to

sudden rises, when they become wholly impassable torrents of enormous volume.

The principal of these is the Topo. This much-dreaded stream forms the chief

obstacle to communication between Ecuador and the countries to the eastward.

The rise of its waters is sometimes so sudden that small parties of traders, with

their train of Indian porters, have been separated whilst crossing it, and sometimes

imprisoned between it and the next torrent, running parallel, for two or three weeks

without the possibility of effecting an exit either way. It rushes, or rather springs,

down its bed at a frightful pace ; and as this is filled with unevenly dispersed

boulders piled up between high rocky banks, the waters leap up to a great height,

filling the air with spray. It was in this condition as Mr. Simson and his party

approached it after a wet and stormy day's march. The spray and even the heads

of the crests thrown up from the boulders washed over the rude suspension bridge

by which the steram is usually crossed. These sudden floods are caused by the

sudden melting of the snow in huge rifts on the eastern flanks of the Ecuadorian

Andes. The waters fell on this occasion as suddenly as they rose, and the author

continued his march down the left bank of the Pastassa until he reached a small

village of the Jivaro tribe of Indians, near the little river Pintuc. Here he com-

menced his westerly march across the country to the banks of the Napo. The

path lay through the same continuous forest which clothes the whole of Eastern

AEcuador, but the steep mountains had here subsided into lower elevations.

peculiar feature of the country was the constant recurrence of long ridges with

narrow summits, called by the Spaniards cuchillas (knives). These run generally

for ten or fifteen miles, and have an elevation from their base sometimes as

great as 500 feet. On one side they are almost perpendicular, and on the other

they descend at a sharp angle. They are composed wholly of loose vegetable

earth and loam, and are held together by the entangled roots and vegetation

with which they are covered. The explanation of these curious ridges, which

occur often between parallel rivers, is not far to seek, in a country where the de-

nuding forces of copious precipitation and flooding waters are displayed on so mag-

nificent a scale. They are simply those portions or " cores " of laud which have

resisted to the present time those denuding agencies that have been for ages at

work grinding down the surfaces of the Eastern Andes and spreading the materials

over the plains at their feet. The coarser portions of the detritus are spread over

the region immediately contiguous, forming the gradually sloping country through

which the Nago and Pastassa flow, which has been worn into valleys, hills, and

cuchillas                                 and the finer silt has been carried  by the  streams  down  to the Amazons
                                       ;

and thence to the Atlantic. The route followed by Mr. Simson crossed the Bobo-

naza to the little settlement of Canelos, and thence to Curarai. The last-mentioned

stream, scarcely known to geographers, has its sources on the outermost slopes of

Llanganati, and after receiving the waters of the Villano, Nushinu, Supinu, Nuganu,

Pundinu, and others, empties itself into the Napo on the right bank. The party

reached the Napo, opposite Aguano, after eighteen days actual walking from Banos.

The Napo at Aguano was found to be a noble river, broader than the Thames at

London Bridge, even when not flooded. At this point the distance is 3100 miles

from the ocean, and no obstacle to navigation exists the whole way.

                                    By Alfred Simson.

   On his journey down the Amazons from the Napo, Mr. Simson seized an oppor-
tunity which offered to take the command ef a small steamer lent by the Brazilian
Government for the purpose of pioneering the way up the little-known river Putu-
mayo, an affluent of the Upper Amazons on the left bank. The Expedition origi-
nated with some energetic merchants of Popayan, in New Granada, who had entered

into an agreement with the Brazilian Government with the object of opening up
this stream to steam navigation and trade, in the conviction that it could be made

an easy outlet for the products of the rich province of Pasto in New Granada sur-

rounding its headwaters. One of these enterprising men had previously descended

the river in a caiioe, and being struck with its adaptability to steam navigation, Lad
purchased a small steamer for the purpose of regular trade communication. The
Brazilian Government cooperated by lending a steam-launch which was to precede
the steamer, survey the navigable channels of the river, and form depots of firewood
at regular intervals for the use of the vessel that was to follow. Mr. Simson's ad-

venturous voyage was completely successful. He ascended the river to a point

1200 miles from its mouth, and found it free from serious obstacles. Its course,
however, is extremely tortuous, and the lower parts subject to malarious fever.
Throughout the whole distance it flows through an alluvial region clothed with
dense forest, at present entirely unexplored. The Putumayo joins the Amazons at
a point distant 1700 miles from the ocean ; and as lines of large steamers have been

for many years established on the main stream, the establishment of steam-navigation
on the Putumayo will now enable any one desirous of making the voyage to ascend

from the Atlantic by steam to the foot of the Andes of New Granada.

        An Account of the Latest Expedition across Central Australia.
                                  By W. H. Tietkens.

   In this paper the author gives a detailed account of an exploring expedition

fitted out by the Hon. Thomas Elder, of South Australia, and headed by Mr.
Ernest Giles, Mr. Tietkens being second in command, the object of which was to
cross the continent from the settlements of South Australia to those of Western
Australia. This object it carried out after seven months of laborious march. The
success of the expedition was rendered possible only by the use of camels instead
of horses, the scarcity of water, that bane of Australian explorers, and the extreme
hardships of a march through dense scrub being more than the horse can endure.

   The expedition, consisting of the above-named officers, including Mr. Young,
four men, and eighteen camels with their drivers, started in July 1875 from Youldeh
(S. lat. 3-4° 10' and E. long. 131° 46'), and after camping at "Ooldabinna (S. lat.
30° 7' 4" and E. long. 131° 15' 4"), and at a native dam a few days journey to the
westward of that place, marched for sixteen days, a distance of 323 miles, without
finding any water. At this perilous moment, when retreat was impossible and
advance almost certain destruction, even the camels being much distressed, Mr.
Tietkens most fortunately discovered a spring which was named by Mr. Giles the
Victoria Spring ; its position is in S. lat. 30° 25' 30", E. long. 123° 31' 13". About
ninety miles to the east of this valuable spring the expedition had traversed a tract
of land which Mr. Tietkens considers the only district on the whole fine of ex-

ploration which would be fitted for settlement. An undulating limestone country,

well grassed, with occasional clumps of Myall {Acacia pendula), and within easy
distance of the seaboard, renders it especially adapted to the staple industry of the
country, that of wool-growing. The experience of this latest expedition confirms
that of previous explorers with regard to the arid and waterless aspect of the
interior of Australia and its absolute unfitness for permanent settlement. The
discovery of this fertile, though apparently waterless, district must therefore be
regarded as a great gain.

   After a march of eight days through the ever-present scrub, [from the Victoria
Spring, the expedition came upon a native well called Ularring (S. lat. 29° 25',
E. long. 120° 31' 4"), and were here attacked by a large party of natives, narrowly
escaping, by prompt action only, the loss of several men, including Mr. Giles. The
possession by some of these natives of articles used in civilized life showed the
expedition that they were at last nearing the settlements. The soil in the vicinity
of Ularring being excellent they planted several seeds of Giant Bamboo, Tasmanian
Blue Gum, and various acacias. These were presented by Baron Ferd. von
Mueller, a distinguished explorer and botanist.

    After a rest of four days at the well, the explorers again plunged into the dis-
tressing scrub, which continued without intermission (a distance of 153 miles)

until they reached Mount Churchman ; this being a point on the borders of civiliza-

tion, they felt that their hardships were nearly over. They soon after reached a
station belonging to a Mr. Chines, -whose shepherd hospitably received and enter-
tained them. Thence to Perth the progress of the expedition was a triumphal

procession.

  The results of the observations made during the journey may he shortly summed

up as follows :

The  main geological feature  of  the country was red  granite                                    early in the journey
                                                                                               ;

limestone was crossed, and once to the south of the route a quartz matrix was hit

upon.

   The phytology was most interesting, and many specimens were collected by Mr.

Young. The vegetation consisted chiefly of Eucalyptus, Casuarina, Callistris, and

various kinds of acacia. The variation of the thermometer during the journey,

which began in June and ended in November, was very considerable. On several

occasions it was as low as freezing-point before simrise, though during the day in
October and November (the Australian spring) it rose to 98° in the shade. In E.
long. 118° 30' and S. lat. 29° 53', on the 26th of October, dew -was first noticed,

and continued to fall throughout the remaining distance to the settlements.

                 ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address by The Eight Hon. the Eael Foetescue, President of the Section.

It is with great diffidence that I present myself before you as Chairman of this

Section. This is the first occasion on which I have accepted any post of any thing

like this kind since, more than 20 years ago, in the course of personal sanitary

investigations to collect materials for my resolutions in the House of Commons about

the health of the army, I contracted a disease which destroyed one eye, per-

manently inj ured the other, and rendered me for years an invalid unable to winter

in England. Nor should I have been induced now to accept this honourable post

were it not that the British Association this year is holding its meeting, not merely

within my own county of Devon, but also in a town which has the strongest claims
upon my gratitude. For it was Plymouth that first gave me a seat in Parliament,

and continued to return me triumphantly as long as I desired to represent it. Great,

indeed, is the increase in extent and the improvement in appearance of the three

towns since those days. I hope and believe that their moral and sanitary improve-

ments have been equally great, though not, of course, as apparent to the mere

visitor's eye. It was in Plymouth, too, that, about 32 years ago, I read in the

Mechanics' Institute a lecture on the Health of Towns, the first paper I had ever

prepared for publication ; and it was in the preparation of that lecture that I first
became fully sensible of the inadequacy of benevolence alone, without some know-

ledge of political economy, to produce really beneficent results, and that I first

practically learnt the great value of Statistics, and their indispensable necessity as

Mythe surest tests of past and safest guides to future action and legislation.                    dis-

tinguished predecessor in this chair last year said (and having myself, as a member

--of the Council of the Statistical Society, received an intimation to the same effect,

I will adopt his words) : " I understand it to be the object of the Association that

in the treatment of the subjects presented to us we should study, in this as in other

departments, to follow as far as may be a strictly scientific method of inquiry, not

lapsing into the discussion of political details, but attempting to ascertain the prin-

ciples on which economic results are founded, and to define the main lines of

economic truth. It may not always be possible to draw the boundary between
--152 report 1877.

science and practice ; but I am sure that we shall all try as much as possible to avoid

matters which involve party or personal questions, and to maintain a calm and

scientific attitude in our treatment of the many subjects which come within the

range of this Section."

   Sir G. Campbell speaks of " the range of this Section." But I must observe that

the further man advances in scientific research the more apparent becomes what, to
use a word borrowed from the French, may be caUed the general solidarity of

science, and the consequently ever-increasing difficulty of drawing hard and fast

lines between its different departments.

For instance, Chemistry has of late thrown great and unexpected light upon Astro-

nomy, after having been extensively brought to bear upon the investigations carried'

on respecting the nutrition of animal and vegetable life and the causes and effects

of disease in both ; while the animal and vegetable kingdoms have been discovered
to approach each other so closely in their lower forms that their exact boimdaries

can hardly be determined.

  And so I may be allowed to remark, even with regard to this Section, whose

double title faithfully represents the inseparable connexion between Economic Science

and Statistics, that it has more connexion in several ways with some of the other

scientific departments of the Association than might in the first instance be supposed.

For example, facilities and cost of transit to persons, goods, and information have

a very practical bearing on scientific investigation generally, and especially on
investigations carried on in concert by a number of different persons in different

places, which it is one great object of this Association to promote ; and therefore

this Association collectively and departmentally has an appreciable interest in the
productiveness, as to direct pecuniary returns, of means of transit, and in the ques-

tion whether profit or public convenience ought to be made the chief object in the

regulation of railways, roads, canals, postal arrangements, and electric telegraphs.

And so, f urther, this Association is interested in the economic laws governing the

service for extending, improving, and working these means of transport; and

further yet I must add, after what happened last month in the United States, it is

interested in the liability of that service to disturbance by the action of the servants

employed iu it, when misguided by the delusion that because they can affect the
cost of production they can control also the demand for what is supplied, and there-

fore its marketable value.

But to return to the connexion between Economic Science and Statistics. The

mere numerical record or collection of bare facts not marshalled on any system

remains an unfruitful heap until the facts reduced to order can be brought to bear

upon the elucidation of some general principle. I was therefore rejoiced when the

London Statistical Society, to which I have had the honour of belonging more than

thirty years, recognized this truth, and from its device of a sheaf with "Aliis

exterendum" under it, omitted the words implying the Society's repudiation of
the duty of thrashing out the corn and winnowing away the chaff. Notwithstand-

ing its modest disavowal, however, I venture to confidently assert that from the very

beginning the records of that Society show a vast amount of pure and valuable

--grain not merely collected, but well threshed and winnowed out by its members,

and stored away in the condition most available for use.

  My predecessor well observes, in language better than I should have been able

to find for myself, " At first sight Statistics expressed in figures might seem to

constitute the most exact of sciences ; but in practice it is far otherwise. In

nothing is so great caution necessary ; there is too great temptation to reduce to

figures facts which are themselves not sufficiently ascertained ; too often an exact-
ness is claimed for these figured results which is altogether fallacious and mislead-

ing It is especially necessary to distinguish between figures which are really

ascertained, and those which are merely drawn by deductions from rough and

conjectural facts  There is very often fear that Statistics are sought out

and adapted to suit a preconceived theory. Another misuse of Statistics is this,

that when they are used to test certain capacities and qualifications work is directed

and shaped to meet the statistical test, and the results thus obtained become mis-

leading. In such a case it is necessaiy very frequently to change the form in

which the statistical test is applied."

I!ut if, on the one hand, the mere record of bare acts till systematized remains

practically useless, and if imperfect or misapplied statistics are misleading, so, on

the other hand, principles deduced from purely abstract reasoning upon economical

for the truths on which they are based are often far from the only truths having

a real bearing' on the particular questions.

 --As. Sir George Campbell further justly observes : " It is by collecting, verifying,

and classifying facts that we are able to approach economic truth. There was a time
when it seems to have been supposed that political economy was a science regulated

by natural laws so fixed that safe results could be attained by deductive reasoning.

But since it has become apparent that men do not in fact invariably follow the

laws of money-making pure and simple, that economic action is affected by moral

causes which cannot be exactly measured, it becomes more and more evident that

we cannot safely trust to a chain of deduction; we must test every step by an

accurate observation of facts, and induction from them. This is, it seems to me,

Wethe highest function of statistical science.   recognize that men are not mere

machines whose course may be set and whose progress may be calculated by a

simple formula. Men are complicated being3, whose minds and motives of action

we do not yet thoroughly understand ; we cannot foretell what they will do till
we are sure that we know what in fact they actually have done and do in a
great variety of circumstances." And therefore deeper reflection and fuller

inquiry have often revealed other truths, which in many instances have largely

modified and, in some, even to a certain extent reversed the conclusions practically

to be deduced in the particular case.

I will take one striking example of the subsequent large modification, not to say

reversal, of the earlier views of political economists, owing to the deeper reflection

and especially the wider information brought to bear upon the question by, in the

first, one single eminent authority among them.

Malthus, in his famous work on Population, lays it down as a law that

while population naturally increases in a geometrical, subsistence increases in an

arithmetical progression only. He was followed in this view by a great majority
of the political economists of his day. And Mr. J. S. Mill, in the last edition

which I have seen (that of 1862) of his 'Principles of Political Economy,' says,
" Having a large family, so far as concerns the public interest, is a thing rather to

he discouraged than promoted; " and again, " That the producing of large families

ought to be regarded with the same feeling as drunkenness or any other physical

excess." Such writings led men to believe that wars and pestilences were sharp but

salutary remedies for the great evil to be feared, namely, over-population, and

were the sad but indispensable supplements to the inadequate operation of what

Malthus and his school called the preventive checks of prudence and morality.

We have, indeed, recently had, professedly based on Malthus's doctrines, to which

public attention has been recalled, a preventive check of immorality propounded.

Put on that I need say no more now than that, however plausible it may sound,

it would be sure in the long run to weaken the national strength and impair the

national well-being, by lowering the national standard of duty and degrading the

national character. History shows how true it is that " righteousness exalteth a

nation, while sin is a reproach to any people."

Put to return to the warnings of Malthus and his school against the danger of

over-population. They founded their views almost entirely on deductive reasoning

without appealing to any adequate amount of actual experience, and therefore

failed to take into account what, in most cases, practically modifies, and even

neutralizes, the action of the principles which they set forth.

Mr. Chadwick demonstrated, in several of his early writings, and especially in

that most remarkable work the ' Sanitary Report of 1642,' that excessive sickness,

mwith premature disability and mortality a population, did not (except, of course,

in very extreme cases) tend in general to diminish the aggregate number, but only

the average efficiency, of the living, and the .average productiveness of their labour.

He showed, with the aid of the comparatively very imperfect statistics then avail-

able, that in the unhealthiest districts of the country the proportion of persons

--incapable of maintaining themselves, of children, of invalids, of the aged (for some

of the most remarkable instances of individual longevity are to be found in them),

was far larger than in the healthy districts. He showed, comparing the healthiest

with the average districts, that the cost of excessive sickness and premature dis-

ability and death, including the consequent loss of productive labour, involved
throughout the kingdom an annual loss of over £14,000,000, even according to

--that defective standard a loss, I may observe, which has gone on uninterruptedly

to the present day ; for, notwithstanding all our wise sanitary legislation and

great expenditure on sanitary works, our annual percentage of excessive mortality
throughout the kingdom resulting from preventible disease has hardly been appre-

ciably diminished, so largely has population increased during that time in places

and under circumstances where no commensurate sanitary precautions had been
adopted. Indeed London has not had its rate of mortality diminished under the
costly mismanagement of the Metropolitan Board of Works.

    Mr. Chadwick, followed and aided by an ever-increasing proportion of econo-

-- --mists, has thus more than modified he has to a great extent reversed the

practical conclusions to be drawn on the report of excessive sickness and mortality,
and has demonstrated the concurrence of the demands of economical prudence

with those of Christian duty on this important subject. But, further, he contended
that in an energetic and skilful population, freely allowed to obtain what they coidd
get more advantageously from other countries for what they could produce more

cheaply at home, the tendency of the demand for labour would be absolutely to

outstrip the ordinary growth of population. He predicted years before it occurred

thai very scarcity oi labourers in England, compared with the demand for them,
which made itself so much felt a few years ago in every branch of industry
 (except perhaps the work of clerks among men, and g >vernesses among women)
 and which, though less pressing quite latterly, owing to the recent almost universal
 depression of trade throughout the world, still presents a marked contrast to earlier
times, and keeps wages at a point, if slightly lowered of late in some branches, yet
in all immensely higher than the old standard.

     Dr. Farr, in his truly philosophical supplement to the 35th report to the Registrar

 General in 1875. shows that as the death-rate rises so does the birth-rate, that the
 christenings for Lend' n from L651 to 1660 were G4,000, while from 1601 to 1G70

 (including the great plague) they were 100,000 in round numbers. He shows that
 within certain limits this continues. But when these are passed and the death-rate

 becomes excessive, as 32*6 per thousand in Manchester and 88- 6 in Liverpool, then

  the birth-rate recedes to 87'3 per thousand in Manchester and 37 - 6 in Liverpool, so
  that but for immigration Liverpool would gradually be depopulated.

     It is curious that while the average number of living children in France is
 under .'!, and in some communes even under 2i, per family, it was about 4i in
 her two German provinces, Alsace and Lorraine. That distinguished economical
  writer, the late M. Wolowski, mentioned to Mr. Chadwick the superior efficiency and
  value of Alsatian labour as compared with French labour generally. It woidd
  almost seem as if a large family, requiring acquisition of means to supply the
  increased demands consequent upon it, acted as a stimulus to increased exertion
  while a small family, requiring only conservatism to supply an unaltered demand,
  permitted more stagnation. The larger families seem to have been chiefly found

 --among those who worked for wages, the smaller ones among the small land-

  owners the latter being less adventurous and energetic, but decidedly the more
  self-denying and saving. The consequence of this state of things in France is
  certainly remarkal >le. The population has remained for some time nearly stationary.
  Indeed, particularly in years of war, as in 1854-1855, it has actually declined a
  little, while it decreased in the two years 1870-71 together about half a million,
  independently of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Still, since the commencement
  of the century, it has decidedly increased, though more and more slowly. The
  number of births per marriage, which at that time was 3-10, had gradually fallen
  to 2-06 in 1808. Dr. Cros, in a paper in the ' Hygiene Publique,' on the " De-
   population of France," remarks that even the actual small surplus of births over
   deaths is entirely owing to the illegitimate births, as by the age of 20 only 1*92
  per marriage would be living of those born in wedlock, i. e. less" than the number

required to replace the two parents. He mentions that eminent statist, M. Legoyt,

and a number of other French writers, as having from time to time for some years

called  attention  to the  diminishing tendency to increase      in  the      French population
                                                                                                                                                          ;

and, while making various suggestions of more than questionable soundness to

check what he, unlike Malthus and Mill, describes as the greatest national mis-

fortune, speaks quite despondingly of the relatively retrogade position of France

in the world, as compared with the Anglo-Saxon race increasing at the rate of

a million a year. The pressure of population in France has never been such as

to lead to any great amount of emigration, though there was some which prospered

fairly in the old Bourbon times. In Algeria, the last conquest of that dynasty, and

--now the only considerable Colonial possession held by France for it may be doubted

whether Cochin China has not too recently been acquired, and whether its occupa-

--tion is not still too largely military, fairly yet to count as a colony in Algeria the

few colonists have not generally prospered much, or spread far beyond the towns

indeed the majority of them "are not French, but Maltese and other foreigners.

And whereas in the' days of the great Lord Chatham her colonies in North America,

with Canada on one side and Louisiana on the other, were more extensive than

--ours whereas, besides having several islands in the West Indies, she balanced us

--in the East Indies, and in France herself she bad more than double the population

that we had in the British Isles, in less than a century she had been practically

swept out of the East Indies, and had lost most of her islands in the "West

Indies. Only a few French settlers remained in America, and those all under

Anglo-Saxon dominion, those in Louisiana being subjects of the United States,

those in Canada of England. For we had conquered Canada and extended our

dominion to the Pacific Ocean, thougb we had by our folly lost the United States

we had taken the Cape from the Dutch, and pushed our settlements far into South

Africa ; we had increased largely by conquest our possessions in the West Indies

almost the whole of Hindostan had been gradually either incorporated in our

dominions, or practically accepted our supremacy; and last, not least, wc had

colonized the Australian continent and New Zealand, both of which were yearly in-

creasing prodigiously in wealth and population. And yet, notwithstanding the large

emigration  from   the  British  Isles  to  the  United  States  as well  as  to  our   >wn  colonies,

                                                                                       i

the number of inhabitants in them had nearly tripled, from about 10,000,000 in

1760, to more than 29,000,000 in 1801, though in France they had only increased

from nearly 22,000,000 to rather more than 37,000,000 during the same interval.

Indeed ours have now increased to more than 32,000,000, which is_ only about

4,000,000 less than those of France since she has lost Alsace and Lorraine.
   To show the complete reversal, among political economists in general, of the once

almost universally received doctrine as to subsistence and population, I must quote,
abridging it slightly, another passage from the same supplement by Dr. Farr which

I cited before :

" Iu the earlier years, though not recorded, the produce hi America increased

undoubtedly as nearly in geometrical progression as the population counted at each

census ; and if the early censuses prove that popidation mcreases, the recent cen-

suses prove that subsistence increases in geometrical progression                      There is a

lnnit to the increase of both people and produce ; but the tendency now is, as men

endowed with skill, weapons, tools, and marvellous machines are diffused over the

world, to create subsistence faster than population                       Malthus lays it down

that (1) ' popidation cannot increase without the means of subsistence ; ' that (2)
'popidation does invariably increase where there are means of subsistence ; ' and

that (3), as stated in Ins last edition, ' the checks which repress the superior power
of population, and keep its effects on a level with the means of subsistence, are all

resolvable into moral restraint, vice, and misery.'                  The theory is as mislead-

ing in practice as it is defective in statement, and, as expressed, erroneous in fact.

It assumes that the restraint of popidation is the corner-stone of policy. Had this

principle been accepted by the people, the population of the kingdom, instead of

amounting to thirty-two millions, would have remained, as it was at the beginning

of the century, sixteen millions. England, in the presence of the great continental

states, would have been now a second-rate power ; her dependencies must have been
lost ; her colonies have remained unpeopled ; her industry crippled for want of

hands ; her commerce limited for want of ships."
156 report--1877.

In truth I know of no book on political economy, certainly in English, tho-

myroughly to be relied on as a guide ; but, then,  power of reading has been for years

so impaired that I find myself more and more left behind in this and other subjects

which I used to study. I have always thought that the valuable works of the late

Mr. Mill owed more of their influence to his marvellous clearness of conception, and

still more of expression, to the delightful simplicity and unaffected grace as well as
lucidity of his style, than to the soundness of his views on several points of political
economy. I have already mentioned the increasing dissent from his views on the
question of over-population. His chapters on Value have been objected to by some

eminent economists, his opinions on freehold cottier farmers (among whom he

erroneously classes Norwegian peasants owning 30 acres of land and upwards, -with

eight or ten cows) are protested against by others, and his views about unearned

increments by still more. He touched very slightly on the important question to

--which I, a little while ago, adverted in relation to means of transit the question, I

mean, of what services or supplies are in their nature monopolies, and on what

principles ought such to be dealt with by the State. His early edition before 1844,

I remember, gave a decidedly defective answer to the first question ; and I have

not found, though that may be because it has escaped my observation, any more

satisfactory answer to it in the last edition I have seen, that of 1862. If I remember
rightly, he, in the early one, ascribed the character of a monopoly requiring State

interference to the extreme costliness of the fixed capital or plant required for pro-
viding that particular source of supply for the public ; but ignored the other more
essential element requisite to the character of a natural and practically inevitable

monopoly of that kind, namely, that of the local, as distinguished from the general,

value of the particular service or supply rendered.

The largest copper- or iron-mine in the world, if it had a million of fixed capital

or plant invested in it, would not have, and ought not to be dealt with as having, a

monopoly, because the article supplied has a general value in the market of the

world. On the other hand, the gas- or waterworks of the smallest town or village,

with a plant of less than £'1000, would have, and ought to be treated as having,

a monopoly, because the whole value of the water and the greater part of that of

the gas supplied depends upon its position, and the greater part of the cost of sup-

plying either consists of the interest on the capital invested in the fixed and perma-

nent works. The water, which is to be had for nothing but the trouble of dipping

for it in the brook below, derives its whole value from the convenience of its position

in the waterpipe, which brings it into the house from the reservoir or forcing-pump.

The value of the service of a coach or omnibus depends equally on its localization
it, like a railway, takes people who want to go from some particular place to some

other. But then the cost of its service consists chiefly in circulating or easily

transferable capital in the shape of the vehicle, horses, and harness, equally available

at a slight expense to render similar service elsewhere ; whereas the materials of

--the reservoirs and the pumping-engines and pipes in the case of waterworks and,
--may I not add, its local act, till lately one of the most costly items would only, if

transferable elsewhere at all, be so at an expense very heavy in proportion to the

concern.

   About these local services and supplies, I know not how to put the argument

more tersely than I did in my address in this town in 1845 :

" In cases where, for the supply of a limited demand, the fixed capital invested

bears a very large proportion to what is called reproductive or circulating capital,

no effectual competition can take place. Unless the exorbitant charges provoke, or

the exorbitant profits tempt, some other party to contend with the original one for

the occupation of the whole or a part of a field not large enough for two, the

monopoly is complete, limited only by the willingness of the public to consume at

the rate charged, and by the dread of the establishment of a rival party. As the

probability of this latter occurrence varies, so will the prices ; they will fall when

the danger is imminent, and be slowly raised as it subsides. If another capital is

invested, for a time competition is sharp ; but before long the two parties find it
their interest to coalesce and to charge the public for a supply produced by the

application of two fixed capitals where one would have sufficed for the work, as
high a price, on the same principle and subject to the same limitations only, as those
hwich affected the returns upon the original capital."

   Sir Robert Peel used to speak of the " torpid hand of Government," and depre-

cated the State or public boaies doing what trading companies could do instead.
I well remember, not long after his passing bis comparatively free-trade tariff,
when we thought he was meditating, though nut yet determined on, the Repeal
of the Corn Laws, how, -peaking one day on some gas or water bill and there-

fore not reported by the papers or Hansard, he described what, in his opinion,

--was a proper remedy for a bad, inadequate, or unduly dear supply namely, to

establish another company to compete with the one complained of. And I "well
remember how, with mo: t unwonted audacity (for at no time of my life have I
but with extreme reluctance, and never, I may add, with any success, attempted

a speech in Parliament), I on that occasion jumped up and said that when he
had studied the question of Free Trade a little more he would find it was per-

fectly applicable to foreign corn and sugar to which he refused to apply it, but

--not without stringent restrictions to water, gas, and railways, to which he was

then applying it that, unlike the former, the latter were all in their nature mono-
polies, and ought, for the sake of the public, to be very carefully restricted as

such*. He ended by applying Free Trade to foreign corn and provisions, but

protesting against its application to foreign, as distinguished from colonial, sugar,
and persisting to the last in his imsound and disastrous encouragement of unre-
stricted competition in railways. His various successors in the Government have
ever since left each proposed line of railway to be unsystematieally dealt with

in the most costly manner each on its own merits, by successive separate com-

mittees of both Houses, not only selected at haphazard, but without being furnished

for their guidance witli any clear principles laid down by Parliament, not even

as to whether the fact of a proposed line being a competing line should be con-
sidered a recommendation or an objection. The natural result of such a continued
lottery in legislation has been an immense needless increase to the cost of rail-

--ways in the shape of parliamentary expenses both in proposing and opposing

lines expenses which have unfairly kept down the average dividends to share-

* Memorandum sent me by an eminent economist and statistician;

" In 1824 a matured plan of a general public system of railway communication was

brought before Sir R. Peel by Mr. Thomas Gray of Exeter. The plan was based,

not upon any mere imagination as to mechanical power, but upon tried and ascer-

tained instances of what had been done and was then doing by steam-power in

railway transit on iron tramways in mines and colleries                                                                                                                                                                                                           and it proposed the general

application of these means, rudimentary it was true, but improvable on more

matured trial, as was afterwards abundantly proved. Now any one who had a

perception of the primary economical importance of cheap and quick transit to a

nation, especially to a manufacturing nation, woidd have regarded the proposal with

lively interest. But he dismissed it with apathy. Gray pressed it then upon the

commercial community of Lancashire, by whom it was taken up, with what ultimate

results we know                                                                  but  they  took it  up  solely at first  for the transit of                                                                                                                      their goods,

and not for the transit of passengers mainly as Gray proposed, and which proved

afterwards its great success.

   "After the great demonstrations afforded by subsequent experience of the gain in

economical power to a nation of this new means of communication, and of what
should have been the new ' King's Highway,' or public means of transit at the

lowest cost, the cost of the service instead of a trading profit (in which view it was
successfully taken up in Belgium and in other parts of the Continent), he still was

lamentable in its consequences by Robert Stephenson and railway authorities them-

selves, as well as by leading political economists. The consequences of that

economical error are recognized as now burtbening the freedom of transit in this

holders, and will for all time necessitate the imposition of otherwise needlessly

high fares and rates on passengers and goods in this country.

  --Now the rates on goods traffic especially involve and this must be my'apology for

--dwelling so long on the subject a very serious question of national importance, once

put in a striking aspect by my enlightened, truly noble, and much-lamented friend,

Lord Taunton, who I always thought would have been more adequately appreciated

by the public, if even in his time, as compared with Lord Althorp's, the ever-

increasing influence of mere oratory, irrespective of political knowledge, statesman-

like foresight, and calm judgment (in a word, of wisdom as distinguished from

cleverness), had not already begun to obtain an undue ascendency in this country.

"While still Mr. Labouchere, he carefully pointed out to the House of Commons

that, after we had wisely abolished the customs duties on all exports whatever,

and on all imports of raw material, in order to give our manufacturers fair play in

their severe competition with foreign rivals, it was essential to protect them from

--being burdened with unduly heavy import and export duties in the shape of high

rates on goods traffic by railway taxes none the less onerous because they went

into the pockets of railway shareholders instead of into the Treasury in relief of

general taxation. In fact the influence of high railway rates on commerce is con-

siderable. In Belgium, the Government owns and works the railways, and,

trusting to their indirectly raising the revenue by increasing the national prosperity,

does not seek to make them a source of direct profit. The consequence is, I am

assured, that an increasing amount of through traffic is being diverted through

Belgium and its ports, the natural course of which would have lain through France

but for her high goods rates.

   The sound view with regard to these questions of local public service and supply

--would seem to be that long ago indicated by Mr. Chadwick namely, that they

should be recognized as, in their nature, monopolies, but, as such, considered to be

the property of the public to be alienated in part for a time, or retained in their

own hands by the State or local authorities as may seem most for the public advan-

tage. That this view is gaining more and more acceptance is evident from the
number of municipalities which have already either set up for themselves or have

bought from their original proprietors the waterworks and the gasworks of their

towns, and are working them for the benefit of the inhabitants. Some have already

done this  with  one or both for many years                                                                                                         many more are taking  steps to do so
                                                                                                                                                 ;

and the Metropolitan Board of Works, who have long only too well verified, by

their mismanagement of much of the business entrusted to them, my predictions

during the debates on the Bill for their establishment in 1855, have now for some

time been wisely contemplating buying up both the water- and gasworks of the

Metropolis, and consolidating under one management what now occupies the staffs

of a number of companies. The very able report just presented to the House of

Commons by the Committee under the efficient Chairmanship of Sir Selwin

Ibbetson, after taking evidence for two Sessions on the subject of the fire brigade

-- myof the Metropolis, gives, in  opinion, conclusive reasons in favour of its various

recommendations the most material of them being that the Metropolitan Board

of Works should purchase all the waterworks within its district, establish a

constant supply at high pressure, and place hydrants all over London, putting the

duty of extinguishing fires in the hands of the police, with a special superintendent

and a special staff to attend particularly to this new branch of police work.

Further reflection and inquiry (and I may add, especially, the warning afforded by

the working of the Metropolitan Board of "Works) have confirmed me in the

--impression which I expressed in these terms in this town in 1845 : " On the
--whole, it seems to me that the necessary works for similar purposes are best con-

structed by individuals or companies for the action of self-interest will induce

--them to do it better and more watchfully with a monopoly granted to them for a

certain time on certain terms; after which the works themselves should revert to

the town, or become, purchasable by the town for a certain amount : that after-
wards they shoidd either be managed by the corporation, or, better still, be let by

public auction by the corporation to parties, either with certain fixed condition's
attached to them at an annual rent to be decided by competition, or else be let

at a fixed rent to whatever party will undertake to guarantee the cheapest and best

supply to the town. These systems seem to me to combine to the greatest degree

practicable the energy and economy observable in undertakings carried on by inte-
rested parties as compared with public bodies, with due security from the unreason-
able charges or ruinous and wasteful competition of companies or individuals under-
taking for profit works which are" too important to the public, and at the same time

too much monopolies in their nature, to be advantageously entrusted unreservedly

and for ever to interested parties."
   "When these or other public works of some analogous kind (as gas, docks, piers)

thus become the property of the municipality, the expenses become a local charge

--upon the inhabitants either wholly borne by those who personally use the supplies

or accommodation thus afforded, leaving only so much as may be used for purely

public purposes, as, e. g., the gas for street lamps, to be paid out of the rates ; or

else chiefly borne by the public, when the payments for what is used by private

individuals are regularly supplemented out of the rates, the rates being the security
on which the requisite capital had to be raised.

   And this brings me to a subject on which I intend troubling you with a few words,

because it is very important, very pressing, andean no longer be considered to partake
at all of a party' character ; for the idea of a more consolidated management of local
public business in our towns, and still more in our country districts, under the

long-established Municipal .Corporations in the former, and under new Coimty
Boards of a more or less representative character in the latter, has now been for
some years advocated as warmly by Conservatives as by Liberals. And the same

happy absence of party character applies to another proposal, not so long pro-
minently brought forward, of making the Union the unit of English administration

after such an adj ustment of boundaries that it should never trangress those of the

county. I rejoice much that this should be so ; for sure I am that to deal at all

satisfactorily with the complicated question of local government in England, with

its rapidly increasing cost, with its chaotic multitude of administrative bodies, all
with their intermixed administrative areas and separate officials, will require all

the combined efforts of the most high-minded and enlightened of both political

parties.

   In the remarks I am now about to offer, I shall rely mainly on the admirable
paper read before the Statistical Society by Captain Craigie, the fruit of much

 research and ability, both in the collection and arrangement of facts and in the
 conclusions founded upon them. I must draw upon his admirably arranged tables
 (most of them laboriously prepared by the collation of several returns, not simply

copied from any one) for the facts which I am about to mention.

Authorities,
160 REPORT--1877.

"I would suggest as the primary and absolutely indispensable step of all attempts

to reform local administration, that a more uniform form of accounts, a thorough

official audit, and a consistent series of returns for a single period be annually re-

quired from every local body, as an absolute condition of its right to levy local taxes.

But, further, I have tried to trace the heads of local expenditure which have most

developed since 1808, and I have endeavoured to give in some sort a rough and, I

fear in many points, a rather crude sketch of the distribution of certain important
heads of local outlay at the present time, a sketch which tended to impress me

--with the value of keeping distinct the twofold functions of local authorities that

of the agents of the State carrying out in local limits national duties affecting the

common weal, and that of undertaking the regulation and execution of purely local

enterprises of special benefit to particular communities.
   " Lastly, I have glanced very briefly at the medley of governing bodies, areas,

and officers which go to make up our system of local administration. And here I

would ask the most earnest consideration for the possibility of reducing the cost of

local government by greatly simplifying its machinery, by devolving on district and

on county authorities, as circumstances prescribe, the several local functions which

have to be carried on. Adopting as the unit some such area as the union, and

bringing that area into harmony with county boundaries, it would present a district

within which it would be perfectly competent to transact all highway, sanitary, and

poor-kw work, embracing such special local needs as are now discharged in lesser

areas by minor bodies, such as lighting and burial boards.

" These districts, apart fronvthe separate organization of the larger municipalities,

might then be drawn together for common action, within their coimty limits, by a

strong representative provincial authority, charged, as it might most economically

be, with all work not necessarily magisterial, and therefore retained in the hands of

officers of the Crown."

   After thus briefly quoting his tersely expressed conclusions, I will proceed to

enforce with some observations of my own his last, relating to the chaotic state of

local administration in England, to which for years I have frequently endeavoured

to call public attention in Parliament and elsewhere.

The confusion of administrative areas, and, till quite lately, in several cases of

duties also, of the different administrative bodies for different purposes is quite

marvellous, with the natural consequence of much needless waste of time, trouble,

--and money. The boundaries cross each other in all directions the boundaries of

counties and unions, the boundaries of unions and highway districts, the boundaries

of unions and magisterial divisions. Neither the municipal boundaries nor those of

local boards under the Public Health Act are always conterminous with those of

parishes ; nor even without exception are the boundaries of counties and parishes,

much less those of the drainage-areas for rating in the Pen districts under private

Acts. Lastly, school districts have introduced (I think needlessly) afresh set of

administrative authorities and areas and of rates ; while the ecclesiastical arch-

deaconries and rural deaneries are independent of all civil divisions except parishes.

For example, one third of my deer-park with its lodge and many of my cottages
and some of my largest coverts, being within a municipal borough, are in a

different administrative area for roads and police and magisterial jurisdiction and

for education, and were two years ago in a different rural deaneiy, from the

rest of my deer-park and my house, though in the same area for poor relief

Captain Craigie shows in a Table that the number of separate local authorities

whose accounts are abstracted in the returns, to which he has referred in his

paper, are more than 12,000, and that the number of persons returned in the

census of 1871 as officers in the employ of the Local Government of the country

was alone 50,000, with salaries which, after careful inquiry, he puts at nearly two

mymillions and a half. As I had contrasted, in 1852, in     published letter to the

electors of Plymouth, so Captain Craigie now contrasts the high salaries of some

of the municipal officials with the comparatively small ones paid to officers of the

Imperial Government. The Town Clerks of Manchester and Liverpool, for

instance, he says, now receive much larger salaries than the President of the

Council or the Local Government Board, or the Secretaries of the Treasury or the

Admiralty. He shows that the debt of local authorities in 1875 was already over

 91 millions, of which the towns owed nearly 40 millions, the Metropolitan Board
  18, Maritime Boards 21, and School Boards 4, together 83 out of the 94, and that
 those debts are rapidly increasing1. It is remarkable how many of these numerous

 administrative bodies have been created, and of these administrative areas have

 been laid out, and of this immense local debt has been contracted in our own time.
    I remember when the parish was bond Jide the unit of English administration,

 with few other bodies besides, except municipal corporations and Courts of County
 Quarter Sessions, administering the local affairs of the country. The parish then

 had to maintain its own poor, keep the King's peace and its own, mend its own roads,
 and repair its own church, after a fashion. It has none of these things to do any

 longer. Indeed it has recently been wittily proposed to define the parish as a place
 where a Church-rate can be made, but cannot be levied. I feel satisfied that the
 first step towards introducing order, economy, and efficiency into this chaotic mass

--of administrative business, into this labyrinth of administrative areas, into this

 army I am afraid, with regard to too large a part, I ought to rather say this mob

 of officials, woidd be to establish County Representative Boards, and make the
 union instead of the parish the unit of English administration, giving it most of
 the power which Municipal Corporations already enjoy, in addition to that which,

--and which alone, it was, in our own time, originally created to fulfil that of ad-

ministering legal relief to the poor. I remember well being attacked, during one

myof contested elections, as an advocate of centralization and the enemy of local

self-government, because I denounced the abuses of Vestry administration and sup-
ported the interference of the Central Government with the mismanagement. I
answered that I did so because I wished local self-government to be economical and

efficient, and therefore strong in the confidence and affection of the people. And

this wifi be best secured, I believe, by placing it under a certain amount of central

control, in order to maintain unity of principle, not, of course, uniformity of detail,

throughout our local administration, so as to protect both minorities from anomalous
treatment and exceptional oppression, and posterity from unjust and unwise burdens,

at the will of perhaps merely temporary local majorities, and, further, to afford

reasonable security to officers engaged in difficult and often necessarily unpopular

duties'. I may add, as the justification for empowering the central authority to re-

quire very full returns and accounts from the local ones, that this would tend to

avert the wastefulness of obliging each local authority in succession to buy much of
its experience by its own errors, instead of having a central body to collect infor-

mation from each, and afterwards circulate it for the guidance of all.

   I must now conclude, with many apologies for the length at which I have in-

truded upon you. But, in truth, some unexpected business has unavoidably engaged

much of the time unduly near the day of meeting, which I had destined to the

preparation of this address, and I have not had leisure to condense it as I ought

and otherwise should. I doubt not that the papers to be read in this Section will

make you some amends by their* superiority in terseness, as well as in all other

respects.

       Memorandum.

In the course of the discussion of one of the papers subsequently read to the

Section on the question of Population, I took occasion to disavow for Mr. Chadwick,

Dr. Farr, and other economists who take our view of the doctrines of Malthus and
Mill on this subject, any idea of in any way countenancing improvidence in mar-

riage or in any thing else. But as I have issued this Address in a separate form, I

think it right to add a few words here in my friends' vindication and my own.
  Under the old Poor Law as it had been for many years administered, children,

whether legitimate or illegitimate, gave the parent a generally recognized claim to
parochial relief proportioned to their number; and the amount of wages was ex-

tensively regulated, not by the action of supply and demand, nor by the amount of
work done by the labourer, but simply by the number of his family. Mr. Chadwick

--drew up for the Commission of Enquiry that remarkable Report which laid the foun-

dation of the new Toor Law Act of 1884 an Act of which it is not too much to say

that it arrested, nay, reversed, the tide of improvidence and idleness resulting frorii

.

the old law, which then threatened the general pauperization of the rural and, to a
considerable extent also, of the urban population. In that and all his subsequent
writings Mr. Chadwick has always sternly denounced improvidence, idleness, and
waste, and consistently advocated enlightened economy and industry alike in
national, local, and individual work. Indeed it is a question whether he will be

better known to posterity and is now better known abroad, where (as is shown by

his Membership of the Institute of France) he enjoys more consideration than he

does in his own country, as the chief author and, practically for years, the chief
administrator of the new Poor Law of 1834, or as the pioneer in the kindred
work of Sanitary Reform. Dr. Farr, coming after him, has always taken
the same line. And I, their humble disciple, may venture to say for myself that

I have always fearlessly denounced, whether officially while Secretary to the

Poor Law Board, or publicly and privately, before and since, all legislation or

administration tending by its laxity to facilitate improvidence, idleness, or waste

and, on the other hand, have done my utmost to promote all legislation, and person-

ally to labour in all local administration, and to support all institutions tending to

facilitate and encourage health, industry, and thrift among our people. With this

object I accepted the office above mentioned and the laborious and unpaid one of
Chairman of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers; with this object, except

while serving in thePoorLawBoard, I have constantly acted as aPoor Law Guardian

ever since I came to man's estate; with this object I, more than a quarter of a
century ago, became President of the Western Provident Association ; with this ob-
1'ect I recently took shares in, and became one of the original Trustees of, the Penny

 3ank founded by Mr. G. Bartley.
   But the clear and fundamental difference between the old school of Malthus and

Mill and the newer and, in my opinion, far sounder one, to which, under the wise

leadership of Mr. Chadwick and Dr. Farr, I have long felt it an honour to belong,

is that we look to morality, intelligence, industry, and thrift, coupled (where expe-

dient) with emigration, instead of, like Malthus and Mill and their disciples, to the

mere restriction of the number of children, as the chief source of national, family,

--and individual well-being. F.

      Thrift as an Element of National Strength. By G. C. T. Bartlet.

   The results of thrift are so universal in the present that they are apt to be for-

gotten by their very familiarity. The houses we live in, the roads along which we
travel, the everyday things we use, even in most places the water we drink, have
only come down to us by the thriftiness of past generations. The effect thrift has

on population is various ; for where it is excessive, as in France, and where it often

merges into the evil of hoarding, it may be said to tend to check increase by
unduly postponing marriage. The application of the results of thrift is a most
important part of economic science. At the end of the last and the beginning of

the present century a great proportion went to maintain wars ; but for the last
fifty years in England it has been devoted generally and very largely to the pro-
duction of works, railways, docks, &c. &c, and without doubt it is this which has

influenced as much as any thing else the progress of this country. Future progress

must depend largely on the same habit ; and hence the importance of promoting
thrift, especially in children, by such agencies as penny banks &c. This thrift
must not be confined to money, but must include economy in time, the best use of
materials for dress, food, &c, and instruction in such matters should therefore
form a part of our national system of education. Experience shows, as proved
undoubtedly by the National Penny Bank, that the promotion of the habit of

thrift depends largely on the facility for its exercise. Thrift may be called not

only the science of domestic comfort and happiness, but of national progress.

  Notts and Recollections on the Cultivation of Tea in the British Himalaytm
        Provinces of Kumaon and Gurlavdl. By J. H. Batten, F.li.G.S.

   The author pointed out on a large map (which had heeu prepared and set up
by .Mr. A. Burrell, for the purpose of illustrating his own statistics of the general

distribution of the tea-plantations throughout all India) the particular districts to
which his paper referred, and, amongst other prefacing remarks, observed that the

highest mountain in Her Britannic Majesty's own dominions, Nunda Devi, having
an elevation of 25,661 feet, was situated in Kumaon, the highest Himalayan peaks,
Mount Everest, Kinchinghingee, and Dwalagiri, being in foreign native territory.

   The main object of the paper was to show that the origin of the tea-industry
was owing, in those districts, not to any discovery of the indigenous plant there
(for he went into botanical details to show the absence of any true Then or Camellia
west of Sikkim, and the mistakes which had been made with regard to certain

plants alleged as producing tea), but to the ability and zeal of certain distin-

guished men, displayed after Kumaon, Gurhwal, and Dehra Dun had been under
British government for some years. These men were, primarily, Dr. Wallich,

Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, and Dr. Royle, similarly placed

at Saharanpur, in Upper India, who had urgently represented the feasibility of

introducing tea into India, with Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General,
who, with characteristic wisdom, had formed an influential committee for the

investigation of the subject. Then, in communication with that committee, ap-

peared on the scene Dr. Hugh Falconer (successor of Boyle at the Saharanpiir

Garden), whose special merits in recommending the Sub-Himalayan districts, and
subsequently in extending the tea-nurseries, introducing Chinese tea-manufacturers,
and in bringing the first manufactured Hill tea to England in 1843, were fully

recorded. Mr. G. W. Traill, Commissioner of Kumaon, was highly commended

for his happy selection in 1835, with the assistance of Mr. Blink worth, plant-
collector for Dr. Wallich, of the two earliest experimental tea-sites, at Almorah
and Bhimtal, and for having sown the first tea-seeds imported from China, and
having nurtured the first tea-plants, destined to become the parents of all that
followed. Next in order Dr. William Jameson was duly celebrated as the central
name notoriously associated with the great official exportation, which between
1843 and 1867 spread the tea-plant broadcast over the Hill districts, and made
Himalayan tea a great fact in the commercial world of Asia and Europe. The
episode of Mr. Robert Fortune, the gardener traveller of China and Japan, visiting
and reporting on the tea-plantations, and suggesting appropriate sites, was men-
tioned as an important era in the history of this industry.

   Mr. Batten, after quoting his own official reports on the suitability of the
Katyur and other districts in Kumaon for future plantations, and giving due
honour to some of his own colleagues, after pointing out certain tentative mistakes
which had occurred in the course of the early exploitation by Government in the
matter of land taken up for tea, concluded his paper by presenting a statistical
list of the existing tea companies and private planters in Kumaon, Gurhwal, and
Dehra Dun, with their several locations (more than 50 in number), and by con-
trasting the state of affairs in 1877, when in the former province alone the esti-

mated yield of tea for the year amounts to 690,000 lbs., with the petty beginnings
of cultivation under Traill and Falconer, where less than ten acres represented the
whole tea-sown soil of the Western Himalaya.

                          Notes on the Statistics of Victoria (Australia).

                              By John Beddoe, M.D., F.R.S.

   The following brief notes are abstracted or condensed from the ' Victorian
Year-book ' for 1875, by Henry Ileylin Hayter, Governient Statist.

   The estimated population for the year consists of 447,000 males and 376,000
females. The proportion of females to males is less than in Tasmania and South

Australia, but greater than in the other Australasian colonies.
   Births are stationary ; the birth-rate is decreasing, but is still higher than in

                                                                                                   13*

England ; the death-rate varies much from year to year, and was high (18 per

1000) in 1875, but does uot seem to be on the increase, notwithstanding that the
average age of the population is probably increasing. In the years 1854 and 1860
the death-rate exceeded 20 per 1000, a rate never since reached.

   Marriages increase very slowly ; the marriage rate decreases, and is now quite

moderate, about 6 per 1000.
   Immigration and emigration fluctuate, but of late years there is a slight excess

of immigration, at least by sea. The Chinese immigration is not large, but exceeds
the emigration, and may be about sufficient to maintain the numbers. Immigration

generally is much less active than in New Zealand, Queensland, and New South

Wales, but more so than in South Australia. In Tasmania and West Australia

emigration is excessive, and Tasmania, especially, is a constant feeder of the

Victorian population.

   The population of live stock increases rather beyond the growth of the human

population; cattle increase faster than sheep. The colony falls below New South

Wales, absolutely, in number of horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs, below Queensland

in cattle only ; it equals New Zealand in number of sheep, and exceeds it in other

animals ; and it exceeds all the other Australasian colonies in the amount of live

stock. The imports of live stock from New South Wales are considerable.

    Relatively to population, however, Victoria is less rich in live stock than any of
the other colonies, except Tasmania and South Australia as to cattle. In extent of
cidtivated land Victoria stands relatively high, and the cultivated area rapidly
increases ; but the increase is almost wholly taken up in green crops. South
Australia stands out from its neighbour, and indeed from all Australasia, by its
great extent of wheat cidtivation, which constantly increases.

   The quantity of wine made has not increased of late.
   The export of gold has fallen off pretty steadily since 1868; that of wool
increases; that of tallow falls off; that of hides and skins is pretty steady. The
imports of butter, cheese, flour, and beer and tobacco decrease. In these, as in
many other respects, the colony grows more independent and self-supporting.
   The population and ratable value of towns, the numher of manufactories, the
amount of deposits in savings'-banks, the number and funds of friendly societies,
the number of scholars, all increase out of proportion to the population of the
colony ; so does the number of letters and newspapers passing through the post-
office ; so does the number of churches and chapels, but not quite so fast.
   Crime decidedly tends to diminish; commitments and convictions are fewer.
Of the criminals, an unfairly large proportion arc Irish Catholics, Irish Protestants
contributing apparently few. Pagans, i. e. Chinese, yield more than their share of

serious crime.

   The general result of all this may be thus briefly stated. With the faffing off,

both absolute and relative, of the production of gold, and the diversion of labour to
other channels, the colony is gradually settling down into a more stable condition

and though the production of wealth may not increase, there is greater economy,

security, and general prosperity.

                  On Agricultural Statistics. By William Botly.

   In the past year there had been a decrease in cattle of 165,598, and in sheep of
1 ,239,369, but an increase in pigs of 239,262, with a decrease in horses used in
agriculture of 12,441, accounted for partly by the steam-engine superseding the
horse, and partly by the decrease of land under the plough. Corn, flax, roots, &c.
showed a decrease of 201,010 acres, whilst pasture &c. increased by 279,671 acres,
of and to which increase the waste lands contribute 78,661 acres. The import of
butter from Denmark, the United States, Belgium, France, and Holland, in 1875,
was 1,251,118 cwt., of the estimated value of £7,285,927; imports of meat
531,008 cwt., of the declared value of £1,465,552. Imports of wheat and other
cereals &c. in 1876 were 77,522,558 cwt., estimated at no less than £51,550,122.
Thus one half of our consumption was imported, each person averaging a con-
suming power of 114 lbs. of animal food per annum, exclusive of poultry, fish,

game, and rabbits. Agricultural statistics had, from a very early period, be< n
considered the means of averting scarcity, famine, and disease; and instead of
the returns being merely permissive, they would most probably eventually, of

necessity, become positive and compulsory.

On tlw Growth of Population with Relation to the. Means of Subsistence.

                          By Stephen Bourne, F.S.S.

                                             [Ordered to be printed in extenso.]

   From the time when Malthus propounded his theories on population, the minds
of many have been concerned with the question whether such a growtli as ho

deprecated is not indeed an evil to be warred against.

    These theories appear to have been :
   1. The growth of population must follow or be regulated by the means of

sustenance.

   2. That the tendency of population was to increase in geometrical, that of sub-
sistence in arithmetical, progression, and therefore that without some corrective
the one must of necessity outstrip the other, and the world become unable to support

the lives thus produced.

   3. That this correction wa3 found in the natural or unnatural occurrence of
famine, pestilence, and war, at the cost of much misery, which it would be wise to
prevent by restraining the natural increase of population through the avoidance of

early marriages.

    In later times our sense of decency has been shocked by the outspoken denuncia-
tion, not of marriage, but of its consequences, and the bold inculcation of means

whereby the gratification of natural inclinations may be conjoined with the viola-
tion of nature's laws and the frustration of nature's ends. Upon the consideration

of such a question it would be manifestly improper to enter here. If, indeed, any
place or time be fitted for such discussion, it must be some other than this one.

But whatever opinion may exist as to the means thus proposed for our adoption,

it is a thoroughly legitimate subject for inquiry, whether the growth of population
is, as these so-called philosophers assume, an evil to be averted; or, as others assert,

a burden to be borne ; or, as many believe, a source of wealth to be prized.

   Ao-ain, looking at the trepidation which Malthus felt at the misery certain to
follow upon any large accession to the seven millions of inhabitants which England

then supported, and comparing the condition in which it now holds and maintains
more than three times that number, we may smile at the folly of his forebodings.
Yet the question is still an open one, whether the limits of sustenance may not
have been reached, and the time have arrived when to follow his counsels would
be true wisdom. It is a desire to see what light can be thrown upon these two
subjects for investigation that has suggested the attempt made in this paper to
ascertain how the various sections of our population are distributed as to occupa-

tions, and the proportions engaged respectively in providing food, other necessaries,

and luxuries.
    Taking as a basis in our inquiry the Census Beports for the year 1871, we, shall

find the population for the three divisions of the United Kingdom thus stated :

England and Wales              22,712,266
                                 3,3(30,018
Scotland                        5,412,377
Ireland

                                                                                                         31,484,601

   Since that date it is estimated to have increased by 1,604,-576, so that at present
it amounts to slightly more than 33 millions. But as there are no means of dis-
tributing these additional inhabitants amongst the several occupations, it will be

necessary to confine our attention to the figures furnished for the census year.
These are divided by the Begister-Gcneral into six classes, in this order :
166 report--1877.

  i. Professional                                                                         891,100
                                                                                       0,804,709
 ii. Domestic                                                                          1,035,737
iii. Commercial                                                                        2,989,154

                                                                                      13,338,704
 v. Industrial
vi. Indefinite

                                                                                                          31,484,001

 --The individuals composing these classes are alike in one respect that they are

all consumers, and need to he provided with the means of subsistence. They differ,

--however, greatly in another in that only a portion are producers, and on the pro-

ductive power of this portion must the whole rest for support. It is impossible

minutely to separate the one from the other ; but we cannot greatly err in adopting
the above division into classes, and for the present purpose may include the third,

--fourth, and fifth as the productive, and the remaining three the first, second,
--and sixth as those whose labour does not actually contribute to the supply on

which they, in common with the producers, depend for sustenance. This, in a
sense, the commercial class does. Strictly speaking, the merchant may be no more
essential to the welfare of the community than the schoolmaster; but the one

assists in procuring the means whereby life is supported, whilst the other, in this

respect, does not consume a portion of that on which existence depends. Thus,

separating the population into two divisions, we shall have :

Producers                                                                             10,450,028
Non-producers                                                                         21,034,03o:"o

                                                                                      81,484,661

the latter being very nearly double the former. Further dividing the class of

producers, we find those engaged in agricultural operations to be 2,989,154, and

the industrial and commercial together 7,400,874; in round numbers three, and

seven and a half millions respectively.

I. The agricultural class embraces those engaged in the cultivation of the soil,

whether "in fields and pastures, 1,447,481 ;" "in woods, 7801;" or "in gardens,

103,095," including not alone the actual agricultural labourers, shepherds, farm

servants, and_ gardeners, but all those returned simply as landed proprietors, all

farmers, graziers, bailiffs, agents, and others whose sole or principal employment is

upon or about the land. It further comprises all persons engaged about animals,

such as horsekeepers, gamekeepers, drovers, cattle-salesmen, fishermen, and others,

-- whomthe business of all of                                   is the capturing, rearing, and dealing in beasts, birds,

and fishes the whole class thus comprehending all whose manual or mental labour,

whose time, thought, and capital, are devoted to calling into existence and utilizing

the various products of animal and vegetable life. It is obvious, however, that not

all of these are engaged solely in the production of human food, which numbers,

for our present purpose, it is important to ascertain. The value of the wool and
flax grown at home has been estimated at per cent, of the whole produce, that of

the oats at 13 per cent., of the barley at 11 per cent., of the peas, beans, and rye at

4 per cent.                                                     in all, 34 per cent.  The corn and hay for the support of horses not
                                                             ;

employed in farming operations is of considerable value, whilst a large number of

woodmen and gardeners, grooms and gamekeepers, are solely engaged in minister-

ing, not to subsistence, but to enjoyment, or in other useful operations. To dis-

cover the exact proportion thus employed would be difficult; but it cannot be

deemed an undue estimate if we say that one fourth at least must devote their

labours to other objects than the raising of food. If we make a deduction to this

extent, it follows that two and a quarter millions of the population axe sufficient to

produce all the home-grown food. This is estimated at about three fifths of the
whole consumption of the kingdom, the remainder being derived from foreign sup-

plies, received in exchange for the produce of our mines and manufactori

suming, as may fairly be done, that each individual employed in manufacturing

operations will produce goods for export equivalent at least to the food which he
                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            167

could raise directly from the soil, we arrive at the conclusion that two thirds of
two and a quarter millions, say one and a half million, should be deducted from the

industrial and added to the food-producing class, and that three and three quarter

millions are actually engaged in producing or procuring food for all the inhabitants

of the United Kingdom.

   But we must go a step further. There are other things which are absolutely
essential for those who thus labour--houses to live in, clothing to wear, and several
minor articles of food, over and above that which is raised at home._ To provide
these, some of our mechanics and operatives must devote their time either directly
to their production, or directlv to producing that which will procure them from
abroad. For reasons which will be better explained when speaking of the indus-
trial class, the number thus employed may be computed at half a million of workers.
The result of these calculations may thus be stated in round numbers :--

whose labour in one shape or another sufficed to maintain in food the 31,500,000

ascertained inhabitants of the kingdom in 1871.

   II. The industrial class, numbering six and a quarter millions, includes all persons
engaged in art and mechanic production, and those working and dealing in textile
fabrics and dress, in food and drinks, and in animal, vegetable, and mineral sub-

stances. To these we may, as before stated, add the commercial class, one million

not that they are actual producers, but because their employment is necessary for
the distribution and exchange of that which others produce, and which without

such assistance could not be utilized. To these seven and a quarter millions we
must add the three quarters of a million of the agricultural class whom we con-

sidered as employed in producing other articles than food, but deduct the one and

a half million the product of whose labour we reckoned as applied to the purchase

of food imported from other countries, leaving six and three quarter millions of
workers engaged in producing, for the benefit of the whole population, substances

not to be consumed as food. In like manner, however, as we added to the food-

producers half a million for those providing articles necessary to their existence, so

must we deduct this half a million from the industrial producers, together with,

say, three quarters of a million similarly employed upon necessaries for these

workers themselves.

These two numbers, thus transferred as necessary for the workers, are to a cer-
Atain extent conjectural, yet not altogether arbitrary.
                                                         close examination of the

suborders and divisions of the census return under the various occupations of the

industrial class leads to the conclusion that, after making the deduction for goods

manufactured to be exchanged for food imports, one half of the workers may be

assigned to the production of articles of necessity; and as this would give some

three or three and a half millions, the proportion for the consumption of the

workers themselves woidd bo about a quarter of a million for the agricultural and

three quarters of a million for the industrial. Thus we get five and a half millions,

the products of whose labour supply themselves with food and necessaries, and the
rest of the community with every thing it uses, beyond the absolute food on which

it subsists.

   Assuming that the necessary supplies for the wants of. the non-productive popu-

lation (including most of the women and all the children ) will absorb the labour of

two and a half millions mi re, we shall have left some three millions for the pro-

duction of luxuries or superfluities and the accumulation of wealth, nearly one

third of the total workers.

   These calculations may be tabulated in round numbers thus :--

                                                            31,500,000

   Although resting upon a sound basis, as regards the numbers employed and the

class of occupation, these calculations can only claim a presumptive accuracy as to

the purposes which such employment serves. There is not much reason to question
the proportion of the nation's power assigned to the production of food; but
opinions may differ as to how much is required for the supply of its necessities,
and the degree in which the product of the remainder is to be considered essential

to comfort and happiness, or to be looked upon as unnecessary or even hurtful. It

is not, however, requisite that there should be precise agreement on these points.

Let it be granted that, after providing the means of subsistence (whatever that may

be deemed to include), there is any surplus at all, the national welfare cannot really
be imperilled by its existence. That such is the case needs no proof. The rapid

growth of its wealth, the luxurious living of so many of its members, and the
ability of so many to exist and spend without any labour, all prove that the means

of subsistence have hitherto kept ahead of the increase of the population.

   III. Another line of argument, founded also upon the Census Returns, will lead
up to the same conclusion. Dividing the whole population, as ascertained in

1871, according to sex and age, we find that there were 15,301,830 males and
16,182,831 females, viz. :--

                              Males.          Females.      Both sexes.

their own support or that of others. It is true that many children below 15, and

aged persons beyond G5, do in part earn the means of subsistence ; but there is

probably an equivalent number between 15 and 05 who do not actually work, and
thus one may be set against the other. Married women, too, and those engaged in

household duties, although in some instances assisting as bread-winners, must,
generally speaking, be excluded from the class of productive workers. These
together amount in round numbers to 17^ millions, leaving 14 millions of an age
and position to be profitably employed. So far, however, as being actually produc-

tive members of the community, we must except the professional class and those

engaged in domestic service, together numbering 3£ millions. Deducting these

from the 14 millions at the working age, we have 10^ millions to perform the

various agricultural and industrial operations on which the nation depends for its

sustenance (necessary and superfluous) and its growth in wealth. By the former
separation into productive occupations, we found that 10^ millions were so classed

--a number so singularly near to the 10| millions arrived at by the division into

ages, as to confirm the accuracy of the reasoning by which we arrive at the follow-

ing results, viz. :

   1. That one third of the population is capable of labouring, and actually does

labour for its own support and that of the remaining two thirds which are depen-

dent upon it.
   2. That of the productive portion of the community about 40 per cent, are

either directly or indirectly engaged in the production of food, from 25 to 30 per
cent, in that of other necessaries, leaving 30 to 35 per cent, free for those occupa-

tions which furnish us with luxuries for consumption or wealth for accumulation.
    3. That therefore the growth of population in this coimtry has not hitherto un-

duly pressed upon or overtaken the means of subsistence.
   IV. If then, as these two sets of figures seem conclusively to show, one worker,

besides procuring food and necessaries for his own support, can and does produce

the food which nourishes six or seven others (4| to 31} millions), whilst there are
on the average no more than one adult and one child dependent upon each pro-
ducing member of the community (10j to 10^ over, and 11 under 15 years), there
can be no doubt whatever that the power employed in raising the means of subsist-
ence is far below what might be made available should more be required. If, again,
the strength of the nation is such that, after allowing for the employment of nearly

one half of its producing power (5 out of 10| millions) in labour for their own

necessities and the food of others, it has more than the other half (5-~ millions) left

to supply the remaining wants of the other 21 millions and the further desires of the

whole 31| millions, there can be no true reason why the growth of the population

needs to be restrained. Neither is there any room to fear that such a ratio of
increase as the present progress furnishes can do no other than add to the produc-

tive power of the nation. If such restriction be advocated, let it be honestly dono
with the object of confining the use of the nation's wealth in undue proportion to

a part of the community, or of substituting luxurious self-indulgence for the natural

use of our powers and privileges.

   The numbers and the conditions of existence with which we are now dealing
are those of the present time, when it is admitted that much room exists for

sanitary, hygienic, and moral improvement, the beginnings of, or rather some advance

in which we already witness. From such improvement there would certainly
result a strengthening of our position. Disease lessens the power of those who
live, and premature death destroys the power which has cost much to rear. The
children under fifteen years of age are rather more in number than the productive

workers ; and reckoning the average consumption of each as equal to half that of
an adult, they must absorb one sixth of the food and necessaries produced by the
workers. This they more than repay during mature years. If, however, life is
 cut short before maturity, every year that it has lasted has been a tax upon the
 means of subsistence, for which there is no recompense. Infant mortality is con-
fessedly higher than it ought to be. Every life which knowledge or care can rescue
 is an addition to future producing power, and so to the surplus which makes the
 nation's wealth. Still more is this the case with improved health amongst pro-

 ducers, because to the extent which disease exists it not only destroys power in the
--170 REPOKT 1877.

sufferer himself, hut draws upon the resources of those whose own power is thus
directed to unproductive uses. It is not too much to hope that an improvement
in this respect is taking place, by which a considerable gain may ensue, the whole

of which will be that of surplus power.
   Beyond this, the constant increase of mechanical power, and of economy in its

uses, largely adds to the producing capacity of those who call it to their aid. What-

ever is thus applied to the actual forcing of a greater yield from the soil, or to the

manufacture of the necessaries for home use, must be a clear gain but so much as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

increases the product of manufactures for exchange with other nations may not

really be any gain, if thereby, through competition or other causes, the value of the
articles produced sustains an equivalent diminution. To make this plain, the reap-

ing-machine will set free so many reapers to reclaim and plant other land ; but an
improved steam-engine may only increase the produce of the loom without ensuring
its value in exchange for food being any greater. The whole tendency, however, of
growing intelligence, knowledge, and wealth is to render the employment of power
more productive, and thus to increase the available surplus. If, therefore, there
be any surplus at all at present, and we have seen that there is a considerable one,
increase of population should cause it to become still greater.

   V. Two objections, however, may arise, which it is important to meet. It may

be asserted that there must be a limit to the numbers which our country can hold
and maintain, and that the time when this limitation makes itself felt has arrived,

or is soon to come. Again, many will maintain that we have even now no true

surplus of productive power, because the producers and their dependents are both
straightened in their consumption, and overstraightened by the amount of labour

which is necessary to procure even that they have, whilst a proper supply of neces-

saries and a just limitation of labour would consume or lessen the surplus now

produced.

   To deal first with this latter argument in both its branches. If we look at the

so-called working classes, it is impossible not to see that in both the quality and
quantity of the food they consume, in the sufficiency and finery of the clothes

they wear, and in the comfort and size of the houses they inhabit, they are better

off at this time than at any previous period. There may be much of squalid
poverty, many ill-filled stomachs and ill-clad backs, uncomfortable houses and

miserable homes, but there is still more of lavish expenditure in drink and
tobacco, of wasted food and unsuitable clothing, of ill-kept habitations and mis-
managed homes. The relief from want is to be obtaiued by the repression of
extravagances, and comfort is to be procured by the economic use of time and
money; for there can be little doubt that the wages earned, if properly employed
and fairly distributed, are amply sufficient to purchase food and necessaries for a
larger population than they now support. With the middle class the strain and
privation, not perhaps of the absolute necessaries, but in those which habit and
education have made such, is probably much greater than in the lower strata.
There is more difficulty in finding profitable employment for sons and fitting
homes for daughters ; but here, too, the cause is to be found in the improvident

--expenditure of money and time, ill-regulated desires, and undue aspirations not,

indeed, here or in the lower classes always on the part of those who suffer ; for the
misery-maker is too often not the one who endures the suffering. With the

higher classes there can be no question as to the actual means of subsistence

or of comfortable existence; it is one of maintaining their present position, or of

failure in attaining a higher one, should the numbers amongst whom existing or

prospective means are to be divided greatly increase. Looking to the rapid
growth and concentration of wealth on the one hand, and the equally rapid in-
crease of luxurious expenditure on the other, it cannot be for a moment main-
tained that, even supposing this accession of means not to keep pace as it has
hitherto done with the growth of population, there is not ample for division
amongst greater numbers. Besides this there seems to be some natural cause or
effect whereby the accretion, possession, or expenditure of wealth is generally at-
tended with a stationary or decreasing family.

   As regards the supposed undue amount of labour exacted from those who pro-
duce for themselves or work for others, almost the same course of reasoning may
                    TRANSACTIONS 01' THE SECTIONS.                171

be pursued. It is not that the aggregate amount of exertion is more than the
whole body can well put forth, it is the unequal distribution among its various

--members. There is scarcely a family or neighbourhood certainly not a town or
--county in which we do not see quite sufficient available power for the relief of

those who are unduly pressed. The time which is devoted to pleasure, or spent in

frivolity and idleness, and the strength which is wasted unnecessarily or ex-

hausted by dissipation, is amply sufficient for lessening the strain put upon the

overworked members of the community ; nay more, it needs no argument, for it

is self-evident to the most ordinary observer, that a just appropriation of time and
a wise administration of power would produce far more than at present without at

all limiting the hours which may rightly be devoted to rest, improvement, and

enjoyment. Excepting for our follies and our pleasures, it cannot be said as a

nation we are on tlie whole overworked, or that we need to restrict the total time

devoted to labour.

But granting, for argument's sake, that these evils do exist, are they to be

removed or lessened by [restraint upon marriage or increase ? Is the disease one

which may be cured by the prescriptions of either Malthus or Bradlaugh ? Do we

find that deferred matrimony or life-long celibacy really add to the productive

power which the abstainers put forth ? Is it not a fact that, as a rule, the larger

families thrive the best, and that a large number of those who have none de-

pendent upon them, themselves become dependent upon others? Let a young

man feel that he has no home to make or keep, and he too often loses the stimulus

to putting forth his productive power, and fails to preserve it by healthy exercise.

He is tempted to expend his earnings in unprofitable or hurtful enjoyments, if even

he does not exhaust his energies by dissipation and self-indulgence. Let a young

woman feel that she is debarred from having a home of her own with those for
whom she may expend her powers and cultivate the best feelings of her nature,

and let her know that instead of being provided for by the husband or sons, on

whom she may lavish her affections and her cares, she must earn her own liveli-

hood, and she is too often forced into uncongenial pursuits and exhausting labours,

which go far to repress her vital powers, and ultimately extinguish her capacity,

not so much for being herself a producer as a real helper to those who are such.
When, on the contrary, the young of both sexes feel that they may possess a
united heme, in which the obligations of parental love may be an incentive to the

preservation and development of their powers, they are supplied with the strongest

inducement to the right use of the health and strength which makes them an

addition to the nation's productiveness. There is nothing in this to enforce matri-

mony and its consequent multiplication of life upon those who are unfitted or

unwilling to enter upon it, nor yet to encourage premature, imprudent, or ill-

assorted unions ; on the contrary, the steady contemplation of the married state

as a legitimate object to be attained will be the best encouragement to prudent

Apreparation.  knowledge of the duties it entails, and the noble self-sacrifice it

likely to have healthy offspring, and in adding to the numbers of the population

to jrive those who will be an increase of its productive powers.

VI. Thus far it has been assumed that an increase of productive power is a

source of strength and prosperity ; but here the former of the two objections

which were suggested requires to be met, and we need to be satisfied that with
possession of increased power we have a sufficient field for its employment.

   Malthus thought that the prudential limits of population for our island was

bed, and trembled for the time when the world might have more

inhabitants than it could possibly feed. The only possible justification for
Bradlaugh's philosophy is, that we are already full enough, and that an addi-

tion to our numbers can but add to our misery.

Political economists, social reformers, and practical philanf hropista of the highest

si imp have thought thai the growth of population is unduly pressing upon the

nation's means, and there can be no doubt that the problem is 03  imewhat

difficult solution. For a series of years the national expenditure for food lias gone

on increasing simultaneously with a diminishing receipt from the salo of the

manufactures which our producing power enables us to send to the countries with

which we trade.

Since 1872 each year has been worse hi this respect than its predecessor, and the

present year promises to be the worst of all that have yet passed. Every succeeding

year the home resources afford a less amount of food per head of its population,
and every year the money value of our exports is also less per head. There
are those amongst us, whose judgment is entitled to respect, who view this state

of things without anxiety, believing either that the growth of our income abroad

advances at least in proportion to our draughts upon it, or that the present de-

pression of trade is but temporary, and will soon give place to returning prosperity.

There are some, too, who really believe that, despite all adverse tokens, the profits

in our manufacturing and trading operations are really greater, and so compensate

for the larger supply we draw from abroad. With the soundness or fallacy of

these different views it is not the business of this paper to deal ; but we have to
consider what bearing these circumstances have upon the continued increase of
the mouths we have to fill, the wants we have to supply.

   Let it be granted, again, that there is a real evil to be overcome, what does it
mean ? that we must interfere with nature's laws or natural results ? or that

we must learn the lessons these results are designed to teach ; that we must

obey the other laws which nature enacts P Is it impossible to bring increased

supplies to our people ? And if it be so, is it out of our power to carry our
people where they may find scope for the employment of their productive power,

in making provision for their wants, and securing possession of comforts and

luxuries ?

  When Abraham and Lot found the land too small to pasture their flocks, they
agreed to extend the borders they occupied. When Solomon wanted the wood of

Lebanon and the gold of Ophir, he exchanged the surplus products of his own
Weland for those of others.
                             in times past have done both, and we must still

do both in larger degree ; for we have this advantage, that the two go hand in

--hand the one helps the other, and thus lessens the strain on both. Every family

which goes forth to cultivate an unoccupied space, to render the earth pro-

ductive where it has never hitherto yielded fruits, or to make two blades grow

where only one grew before, furnishes additional customers for our industrial

class at home, and enables our land in comfort to hold increasing numbers.

It is probable that there never was a time when colonization was so easy as it

empty-handed, and cau prepare the way for them with the certainty that the

Weinvestment will pay.  have ships that can carry them with speed, safety, and

Weeconomy.    have broad acres under our own sovereign's sway where we may

plant or consolidate cur laws, our customs, our principles of justice and religion;

or we have peaceful relations with other nations who will be only too glad to
Wereceive our people.
                        have scientific means for lessening the hardships inci-

dent to a new life, and we have still brave hearts and true to go up and possess

Wethe lands.     have, then, mechanical skill, industrious workers, rich capitalists

and manufacturers at home to receive the products of industry abroad, to cheaply

convert them into articles of utility and luxury, to speedily return them in their

useful forms to those who have raised the  raw materials                                                       and  we  have facility of

intercourse to prevent the entire rupture of family ties, to cement old friendships,

and to create new tastes and inclinations in those who are in reality less sepa-

rated in time and distance than were our forefathers when actually within the
borders of our own little island.

Again, colonization in the present day may be different in its character from that

Weof previous times.  then went forth to conquer, rob, oppress, and exterminate

Wethe aboriginal inhabitants of the settlements we chose.                                                           now go, or ought to

go, to them with the open hand of friendship, teach them our laws, instruct their

ignorance, help their weakness, carry to them the blessings of civilization and
Christianity, and thus make them at once our friends and our customers.

   In all these several ways a small exodus from home may serve to restore the

balance and to furnish the means of subsistence for the many who remain behind.
By so doing a rcdunduncy of population will become the means of producing re-

dundant food, health, happiness, and wealth.

   VII. Away, then ,with the false economy and cold expediency which would stifle
all the finer feelings of our nature, cramp all the expansive powers of our minds,

rob us of all the warmer desires of our hearts, which would check the progress of
the world in all that can constitute real greatness, by selfishly refusing to convey
to the dark regions of the earth the light which art, science, and religion have

 emitted us to enjoy. Away still more with the impure philosophy which would

Segrade us to mere machines for the gratification of the inclinations given us for

--wise and noble ends creatures of the fiesh rather than of the mind and spirit,

wallowers in the filth of this world rather than aspirants for the purity of

heaven.

   Whether, therefore, we examine into the present resources and demands of the
population, or whether we look to the economy of the vegetable or the animal
world, the experience of human history, the record of human progress, the con-
stitution of the human frame, the objects of human existence, or the prospects
of our race in the future of this world and the eternity of the next, we shall find

that the law of increase is of natural and divine enactment. Let us honestly
strive to discover wherein lies the secret of our strength, the security for our hap-

piness, and we shall realize the conviction that it is to be found in fulfilling the
terms of the charter whereby we hold possession of the earth and dominance over
the lower creatures : " Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."

         On the Water Supply of London. By J. F. Bramwell, F.B.S.

   In the year 1874 the population of London supplied with water was 3,055,000,
dwelling in 511,000 houses, and the daily average quantity throughout the year was
110,250,000 gallons. The quantity per head, therefore, for all purposes was a
little under 32 gallons. This water supply was in the hands of eight companies,
and the aggregate capital employed in 1874, including share and loan capital, was
£11,196,000. The gross income from the water was £1,137,000, and, in addition
to this, there was £10,000 from land rents, making a total of £1,153,000. The
expenses were £447,000, so that the nett income was £705,700, giving a rate of
interest upon all capital employed of proximately 3- per cent. The last report,
made in June, showed that the population supplied was 3,790,000, dwelling in
533,000 houses, and the average daily quantity was 132J million gallons, equal to
a little less than 35 gallons per head. The water supply of London for purposes
of cleanliness (personal and domestic), manufacturing, and road-watering was

generally satisfactory ; but, except in rare cases, this could not be said of the water
for drinking and culinary purposes, nor in any case could it be said of the water for

the purpose of extinguishing fire. And yet the importance of these two objects it

was diihcult to exaggerate, as on the quality of the potable water depended to a
large extent the health of a vast population, and on an adequate provision for the
extinction of fire depended the preservation of the largest aggregation of wealth in the
world. There were many who supposed that the defects complained of arose from the
fact of the supply being in the hands of private trading companies, and who urged
that if the undertakings of those companies were acquired by the governing body
of the metropolis, so as to put the whole water supply under one management, every
complaint would disappear ; but this could not be the case if, after the acquisition
of the property by the governing authority, the present system was continued.
That system was the obtaining of water for all purposes either from the Thames,
the sea, or from wells. With the exception of the well-supply the water so ob-
tained was put into depositing reservoirs, was filtered, and was thus treated whether
it be used to flush a sewer or whether it was drunk and delivered at one and the
same pressure, whether it be required at the basement of a house or for the ex-
tinction of a fire. If the governing authority pursued the same system, obviously,
though there might be some economy in management, there would be no radical
change, either in the quality of the water for drinking, or in the quantity and
pressure for the extinction of fire. It would be no advantage for the Corporation
to buy up the present companies unless they went to a di lie rent source for a supply
--174 report 1877.

and his proposal was that the water should be got from deep wells within a dis-
tance of about twelve miles from London, and pumping that water to reservoirs
400 feet above the ordnance datum, these reservoirs to be connected or coupled with
large mains, and arterial pipes to be laid in every street, and hydrants fixed on the
pipes. These pipes for the supply of potable water should be laid to every house,
with a closed cistern attached, so that from three to ten gallons could be drawn off
at a time. But all water for washing-purposes was to be taken from the companies
as before. The object of this proposed change was to give to the metropolis good
water for drinking and culinary purposes, as well as to secure a sufficient quantity

for the extinction of fire.

  On the Debts and Liabilities of Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign States due to

                   Foreign Creditors. By Hyde Clabke, F.S.S.

   The author showed how the number of these States had increased in this century,

and that for all were claimed the prerogatives of sovereign States of the highest
civilization. The U.S. of Columbia and the Argentine Confederation had imitated
the United States of America in endowing their provinces with a sovereign title.
In consequence of the war of secession, the States of the American Union had
ceased to be really sovereign, although retainingthe title and privileges. Thus
they could not be sued in the United States Supreme Court, nor in foreign courts,
while no diplomatic agents were accredited to them, and the United States Federal
Government declined to interfere with them. At the same time the English
Foreign Office had adopted a policy of non-interference with sovereign and semi-
sovereign States for claims of English merchants and creditors. The author traced
the progress of the issue of foreign loans in its legitimate relations, and in its

recent illegitimate expansion for fraudulent purposes. He showed that at present

although States can sue in English courts for claims against English citizens, they

are not allowed to be sued. He expressed a doubt whether, as a question of interna-
tional law, any State had the prerogative of suing. He held it to be only a matter of

 comitv, but subject to submission to the procedure of the courts of England, France,
 &c. Having pointed out the hardship to merchants and others of the present one-

 sided jurisdiction, he proposed that it should be made a rule of the procedure of
 courts' in Europe and America, that on a State presenting itself as plaintiff, it should

 be acquired to accept services as a defendant. Service should be made, not on an
 ambassador or minister, but on the commercial agents, the consul, or fiscal agent.

              On some Doctrines of Population. By Dr. Faee, F.B.S.

    The author said the unity of the human family was an accepted scientific truth.

 Although there were infinite diversities in men, differences not only in rank, but

 in character, never such equality between man and man as was passionately asserted

 at the French revolution, and no single nationality in the same stage of civilization
 as the rest, yet there was a unity of plan, of structure, faculty, passion, sense, and
 intellect in individuals and in nations. The population of the world was estimated
 by McCulloch in 1841 at 800,000,000 ; others raised the numbers to a thousand

 millions ; but the more recent estimates of Behm and Wagner made the popula-

 lation of the world 1,424 millions. The population of Europe and of America was
 known by the censuses to be increasing, and it was probable that there was some,
 though not a corresponding increase in Asia and Africa ; but the chief difference
 was due to the recent estimate being based on a better knowledge of Africa and
 Asia, acquired by geographical exploration. There had been censuses of the greater
 part of European States, and it was announced at the St. Petersburg Conference
 that the Russian Government proposed to take a census, by name, of its subjects in

 --1878. In a few years we might hope that the popidation of Turkey the only un-

--istical State in Europe would be enumerated. What degree of reliance was

to be placed on tbe census of China he did not know. The most remarkable recent

statistical operation, and one which did infinite credit to the Government, tbe Civil

Service, and the people, was tbe census of British India, which was found to con-

tain more subjects than had ever been conjectured. In the last century some

thinkers called in question the account of the origin of mankind in tbe hist chapters

of Genesis. They contended that it was impossible to admit that tbe millions of

--people then living on tbe earth could have descended from two ancestors Adam

and Eve. But Euler undertook to meet the objectors, and he showed that by a

process of doubling tbe population from one pair, it might be increased to any con-

ceivable number. Tbe subject bad been prosecuted still further by Malthus and

others, and in tbe abstract nothing was simpler than the exponential equation by

wbicb tbe number of years in which a sum of money, increasing at compound in-

terest, or a population increasing at any rate in geometrical progression would

double itself. It bad been laid down that a population eoidd double itself in

twenty-five years, but it bad not yet been proved. It was true that the popidation

of tbe United States, during a period of seventy years, was doubled every 2;jj years,

but it did not double itself at tbat rate, for the increase was largely due to immi-

gration.

The autbor next pointed out that tbe natural increase of population was due to

tbe excess of births over deaths ; and be filso showed by a series of statistics that

the reduction of the death-rate did not imply a more rapid increase of population.

He argued further tbat a diminution of the "mortality of England by sanitary im-
provement was in no danger of multiplying men beyond tbe means of subsistence.

Experience proved tbe contrary : the birtb-rate and the death-rate by tbe providence

of tbe people rose and fell together. The birtb-rate was depressed below its

standard in England and France                                                                                                                                                     it varied with the prosperity of tbe country, witb

tbe demand for people, and it could be reduced to as low a figure as tbe lowest

attainable deatb-rate ; and he contended that to keep a population stationary, or to

--retard national growth, there was need of neitber of tbe destroying angels war,

pestilence, or famine. While he did not decry the existence of armies and navies,

be utterly denied tbat wars were necessary to cbeck tbe g-rowtb of population.

Although it bad been sbown tbat tbe birtb-rate could be reduced, be asked wbether

it would be wise in this country to accept tbat policy wbicb bad been advocated

by Malthus, Mill, Drysdale, and others. He shared in the admiration which bad

been expressed of Mill, and appreciated mucb tbat Malthus had written                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    but against

nothing was it more clearly their duty to protest than tbe errors of authorities in

philosophy. Admirable as were the industry and thrift of the Frencb peasant, be
could no more bold tbat England was called upon to practice his social philosophy,

than to revolutionize our agriculture by eitber cutting up the land into infinites-

imal parcels, or ceasing to employ in its culture tbe several capitals of tbe land-

lord in acres, tbe farmer in stock, or tbe labourer in thews, sinews, and inherited

skill.

On the Cost of adopting the System of Public Prosecutors in England, as illus-
   trated by the results of the Scotch and Irish Systems. By W. Neilson
   Hakcock, LL.D.

   Tbe autbor showed that the extension to England of tbe system of public pro-
secution, which bad long existed in Scotland and Ireland, was apparently only a
question of time. In 1872 Mr. Walpole had said, " it was really a disgrace", and' lie
used the word advisedly, that England was the only country in the world where
prosecutions for crime were left at the mercy of private individuals, who might or
not proceed with them as they thought fit." That the delay in adopting so eesen-
tial a reform is connected with fears of the cost, appears from the observation of

the Home Secretary, who, while announcing tbat a bill was prepared, said, a

" public prosecutor was an expensive luxury." The Scotch system of a local Crown

Solicitor, called a Procurator Fiscal, in CO districts in Scotland, taking charge under
tbe direction of the Lord Advocate (who corresponds to the English and Irish
 176 report--1877.

 Attorney-General) of all prosecutions from the yery commencement to the final

 --stage, C09t only £27,960 a year, viz. : £23,332 for salaries, £3,708 for other emo-

 luments, and £920 for office expenses. The effect of this public local officer taking
 charge of prosecutions arising out of sudden deaths was to dispense altogether with
 coroners' inquests, the inquiry by the Crown Solicitor into every sudden death that
 might possibly have resulted from crime being accepted as a complete substitute for
 coroners' inquests, which do not exist in Scotland. In England the direct cost of
 coroners' inquests was £84,285. From this it may be estimated that the dispensing
 with coroners' inquests iu Scotland is a direct saving of about £14,000 a year, or
 half the whole cost of the Crown Solicitors. There is a further saving in having
 only a single instead of a double preliminary inquiry : this diminishes the time and
 expenses of witnesses, and saves double information, with all risk of complication
 and failure of justice the double informations before coroners and justices give rise
 to. The Scotch system leads to a further saving at the trial. With them the case
 goes hefore only one jury, composed partly of special and partly of common jurors.
 Their proceeding is like information in England, and, except in cases of treason,
 bills of indictment are not sent to a Grand Jury. This saves time of witnesses, of
 judges, and jurors when trials actually take place. The witnesses especially are
 saved, because the public prosecutor can regulate the whole course of the business,
 and witnesses need not as at present necessarily attend from the commencement of
 the assizes, hut only when the trial is fixed. The single jury system leads to
 another saving, prosecutions in Scotland being stopped at an early stage, which in
 England and Ireland are stopped by Grand Juries, involving cost of attendance, of
 witnesses, and of court proceedings. In Ireland (if the cost of inquests, £8,094,
 which the Scotch precedent would indicate to be unnecessary, be deducted) the

 true cost of the public prosecutor system, £69,025, very slightly exceeded the cost of
 the English system, £02,015,' in a portion of the population equal to that of

Ireland. The slightly greater cost of the public prosecutor system in Ireland was
 far more than counterbalanced by having only 9§ in each 10,000 of the population,
instead of 14, as in England and Wales, confined at the cost of the State in goals,
convict prisons, and reformatories. These institutions cost only £187,155 in the
year in Ireland, as compared with a cost of £239,926 in an equal population in
England and Wales, or £52,771 less. The Irish system does not, like the Scotch,
meet frauds connected with public companies, and embezzlement on private
people : these are left to the private prosecutor, as to which there is a strong de-
mand for a public prosecutor intervening. This arises in part, no doubt, from the
idea that crimes of this class seldom occur without some great carelessness or neglect
of checking on the part of the person injured making it proper for them to bear
the cost of prosecution. This view could, however, be met without entrusting the
conduct of the cases to them, with the strong temptation to abandon a prosecution
that must disclose their own neglect and want of caution. The true plan would
appear to be, not only in those cases of fraud and embezzlement, but iu all cases
where crimes arose to any considerable extent from culpable carelessness or neglect,

or from provocation of the person against whom the crime was committed, to give

the court power, while punishing the crime on the one hand, to award, on applica-
tion of the public prosecutor, the whole or any portion of the costs to be paid by
the person whoso neglect or provocation led to the crime being committed.

On the Law of Succession to Property. By W. Neiison Hancock, LL.D.

The author said that fewpeople who discuss laws of succession seem to be aware that

there are in England three laws of succession as to property in land, and were, till 1856,

three laws of succession as to personal property. They rest, however, upon nogeneral

or scientific principle. The differences in the succession of real property depend

on the accidents of tenure ; those in personal property arose from the customs which

eldest son and widow, the widow getting a third for her life only. In freehold

succession (estates for a life or lives, whether renewable or not) all goes to the

eldest son, and the widow gets nothing. In succession to yearly tenancies
or leases for years, however many, it goes to the widow and all the children,

the widow getting a third (not for life, but absolutely), and all the chil-

dren taking the other two thirds in equal shares, and the eldest son comes in

for this share, no matter how much of fee-simple or freehold he may inherit

from the same intestate from whom the personal property comes. As to succession

to personal property in the Province of York, land, as well as money, before 1856,

constituted an advancement ; and, however small the value of the land inherited by

the eldest sod, it was an absolute bar to his sharing with the other children in the

personality under the custom. According to the custom of London, in the matter

of advancement, no regard was paid to a freehold estate, but chattel interests were

deemed an advancement. As to the succession of widows, the customs of London
and York both gave widows their apparel and the furniture of their own room ; in

York they had, besides, their coffer- box including all jewels, &c In addition to

these privileges, if there be children, they got four ninths of the residue ; or, if

there be no children, three fourths. In all other parts of England and in Ireland

widows had no privilege as to apparel, furniture, or coffer-box, and get only three

Whenninths, or a third if there be children, and a half if there be not.  these

various laws of succession are tested by the usages of settlement and devise, they are

found not to correspond with the usual dispositions of any class as to landed pro-

perty. As the disposal of property in England and Ireland rests upon freedom of
bequests and settlement, it follows, as a scientific consequence, that when there is,

amongst large classes that can be easily marked out by well-ascertained differences,

the usual disposal of property at death, the true and scientific solution of the law

of succession is to make the law for each such class correspond to the usage. It is
upon this principle of recognizing usage that the customs of London and York have

prevailed for two centuries. The etl'ect of this would be to leave primogeniture
amongst peers and landed proprietors undisturbed. The eldest son should, however,

take the property, charged with portions at the usual rate for younger children, and

jointure at the usual rate in lieu of dower. Amongst manufacturers and other capita-

lists the mansion and furniture, and an income to maintain it, would go to the widow,

subject to condition of not marrying again, and providing home for her unmarried

children. Property, whether real or personal, would be divided so as to give each

son twice the portion of each daughter, the sons' shares to go equally, the daughters.'

--shares to form a common fund, subject tomothei's appointment amongst daughteis

and their issue, with farmers (whether tenants or proprietors), unless there be

to the son that she shall select ; or if there be not any son, in like event to daugh-

ters that she shall select. The widow, thus displaced by child in succession, to have

On the importance of Increasing the Punishment of Habitual Drunkards, and
       of Punishing those who Seriously Injure their Children by what they Spend
      in Drink. By \V. Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

The author quoted some Irish statistics, with which he was officially connected,

showing that out of 14,410 commitments of men of ascertained bad character pro-

ceeded against on indictment and summarily, no less than 5,602, or 39 per cent.,

were commitments of habitual drunkards. Taking the corresponding classes among

--women out of 4,477 commitments the commitments of habitual drunkards were

1,063, or 32 per cent. In the case of men the commitments of habitual drunkards
were rive times the number of known thieves, and in the case of women three times.

--This indicates one of two conclusions either that the habitual drunkards are a very

numerous class as compared with the thieves, or else that owing to the shortness of
the punishments for drunkenness the same habitual drunkards are committed oyer
and over again. The statistics do not enable the author to analyze exactly which
is the true solution ; but it is obvious that if the habitual drunkards are more nume-
rous than the known thieves, something like the punishment of thieves should be
applied to such a formidable class. If, on the other hand, it is the same persons being

repeatedly committed within the year that swells the number, it indicates how in-

effectual the petty imprisonments inflicted are to reform and check the habitual
drunkards so punished. The calamitous effects upon the victims themselves of
allowing habitual drunkards to proceed in their career unchecked is shown by some
other figures. The deaths from excessive drinking in a year in Ireland (128) are more
numerous than the manslaughters, murders, and deaths aggravated by neglect (126).
In a portion of the population of England and Wales equal to that of Ireland the
proportion is still more marked, 115 deaths from excessive drinking, as compared
with 93 from manslaughter, murders, and deaths aggravated by neglect. In com-
paring the serious crime of Ireland with that of England and Wales, it has been

for many years from 30 to 40 per cent, less in Ireland than in a corresponding
population in England. One marked exception occurs to this rale; in crimes
against human life taken together the proportion is the other way. Takings recent

year for example, the Irish figures are greater than the English by about eight per
cent. Taking a selection of these carefully examined, it appears that 4G per cent,
belong to the less serious class, and 54 per cent, to the most serious class. Of the

--most serious cases, 57 in number, 27, or nearly one half, were connected with

 drunkenness or drink a very large proportion, compared with G from party or
 faction disputes, G from malicious ill-feeling, 5 from agrarian crimes between
 landlord and tenant, 4 from immorality, 3 from protection of game, and 2 from

 robbery. Of the 243,145 offences determined summarily in a single year in

 Ireland, no less than 102,304, or 42 per cent., were for drunkenness, or drunk
 and disorderly. Of the 192,857 classed punishments, 170,056, or 86 per cent., were
 fines, and only 47 per cent, other punishments. In England and Wales 24 per

 cent, were other vices punished, and only 79 per cent, fined. From the aspect of

 these figures there can be little doubt that the habitual drunkards figured largely in

 these respective cases of fines, which occupied so much of the attention of the courts
 and police. One other aspect of the statistics should be noticed. Notwithstanding
 the general and continuous decrease in serious crime in Ireland, when there is an
 increase in convictions for drunkenness, the author has generally had to notice an
 increase in offences indicating a low moral tone, such as aggravated assaults on
 women and children, cruelty to animals, and assaidts on peace officers. The State
 has commenced in England and Scotland protection from one species of parental
 neglect, that of not supplying education. The necessity of this protection, so far as
 England is concerned, was shown by the fact that in 1875 there were in England and
 Wales 21,334 convictions for offences against the Elementary School Act. In Ire-
 land we have no similar protection, as there is no provision for compulsory education
 in Ireland. The analogy of protecting children by these provisions as to compulsory
 education suggests protection of them in other respects against the results of undue

 expenditure in drink, connected as it so frequently is with habitual drunkenness.

    The remedies suggested were :
     1. That punishment for drunkenness should take the form of more lengthened
 detentions, with a view towards reformation ; in other words, that punishment

  should be of a reformatory character.

    2. That when reformation became hopeless, the drink-craving should be treated

  as a physical disease to be treated like any other form of insanity.

    3. That the protection of children and wives of men repeatedly convicted of
 drunkenness should commence at an earlier stage than at present, by the men being,

 after imprisonment, at first let out on license like younger persons released from

 reformatories, witli a certain supervision and watchfulness over their conduct to

 their wives and children, to see that they were adequately cared for according

 to the means of the parent.

 On the Assimilation of the Laws of the United Kingdom, with especial reference

       to the Town Laws of Scotland as to Ruinous Buildings. By W. Neilson

        Hancock, LL.D.

    In Scotland in one hundred of the principal towns called Royal Burgs, unber an
Act of the Scotch Parliament two centuries old, in all cases of doubtful or in-
secure title, certain Burg magistrates can, after certain public notice, give a valid
charge for the execution of repairs and buildings sanctioned by them. In England
and Ireland the corresponding power only dates so recently as 18ti8, and, instead
of extending to all town-buildings, is limited to the single case of artisans' and

labourers' dwellings in a state dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habi-

tation. The Scotch Law further deals with the case of waste and uninhabited
houses when the owners are not known, or are unwilling to build or repair in a

decent way. The Burg magistrates may, after due notice, have the property valued
and sold, preserving the price for the owner. These Scotch Laws are reported by
Mr. MacNeel Caird as in successful operation, and their extension to Ireland has

heen approved of by the Town Councils of Dublin and Belfast. The delay in ex-
tending to the whole United Kingdom this simple and wise embodiment of the

sound economic principle of promoting improvements by giving security for capital
and guarding against the impediments to improvement which defects of title create,
shows the backward state, of the whole system of the assimilation of the laws of
the three parts of the United Kingdom. While the Ante-Union statutes of England
have been all revised and expurgated, and a revised edition published some time
since, for Ireland and Scotland the similar work has been neglected, the revision
of the Irish statutes being thus several hundred years behind the English and Im-
perial statutes. Thus the very basis of a scientific assimilation of the laws is want-

ing. If a state provision for carrying out assimilation as far as possible existed, the

distinct law of Scotland and Ireland would be studied, and the elements of good in
them, as in the present case, preserved, by being generalized and extended to the
whole United Kingdom. The defects and shortcomings in them would, on the other
hand, be remedied. The past Session of Parliament has been marked by some very
wise and successful assimilations, the three Prison Acts for England, Scotland, and.
Ireland on substantially the same lines, the Irish Judicature Act and the Irish
County Courts Acts on the lines of the corresponding English Acts. These legis-
lative achievements only show what wonderful results would be attained if there

was a really large and systematic effort at assimilation of the laws of the three

portions of the United Kingdom. If the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary,

the Chief Secretary for Ireland, the Irish Attorney-General, and the Lord Advocate
of Scotland were constituted a standing committee charged with this duty, their
hist step would be to have the expurgations of the Ante-Union statutes of Ireland
and Scotland brought to the same state as that of the Ante-Union statutes of Eng-
land, and to have an expurgated edition of these statutes published. Their second
step would be to have the able and succinct account given by Paterson of the dif-
ferences in the laws of England and Scotland revised and brought up to date.
Thirdly, to have a similar account of the differences of the Irish and English law
prepared. Fourthly, to have steps taken for the prompt extinction of all non-essen-
tial differences in the laws, where the assimilation was easy, obvious, and not
strongly opposed. Fifthly, in cases where assimilation was found difficult or was
strongly opposed, a careful historical account might be prepared of the origin of the
differences of the laws and of the practical working of each form of legislation.
The publication of such accounts would have a tendency to diminish opposition,
and to lead to suggestions for removing difficulties. Such a work would by its
breadth and scientific character simplify the business of legislation, save the time
of Parliament, and prevent delay in the adoption of useful reforms, the principles
of which are conceded. It would, too, lay the lasting and sure foundation of
good government and the contentment of all Her Majesty's subjects in whatever
part of the United Kingdom it was their lot to live.

On the Health of Plymouth. By Thomas Littleton, M.B., F.B.O.S.

   The estimated population of Plymouth, in 1877, was 72,911, that of Devonport
49,449, and that of Stonehouse 14,685 ; total of the Three Towns, 136,945. The

--health of Plymouth represented that of a large extent of country the banks of the
--Tamar and Plym. The late Rev. J. Wallis (Cornwall Register, 1847), speaking

of this district, said : " The twelve parishes, &c, form one of the most interesting

and beautiful districts in the world, &c." The health of Plymouth in fortirc times

had been fully illustrated by Drs. lluxham, Mudge, Yonge, Woolcombe, and

Blackmore, Sir S. Hammick, Dr. Butter, and others. Plymouth had been also the

subject of a great number of reports in connexion with sanitary matters by Odgers,

Rawlinson, Hawksley, A. Rooker, Dr. A. Smith, and Dr. Letbeby, and they were

now awaiting a report by Dr. Ballard, of the Local Government Board. But it

was to the elaborate and exact statistics set fourth by Dr. Farr, in his Supplement

to the Thirty-fifth Annual Report of the Registrar-General, that he must chiefly

direct attention. The average annual rainfall of Plymouth, as observed by Dr.

Huxham, was 30'35 inches. Sir John Forbes stated it at 81, and during the last

12 years Dr. Merritield had found the average to be 37 inches. Mr. G. J. Symons's

statement that it was 44-81 inches represented Ham, Plympton, Dartmoor, &c,

and not the town of Plymouth proper. The same is to be understood of Mr.

Bellamv's remarks. The chemical examination of Plymouth rain showed its

healthf"illness in a favourable light. The planting of trees had been spoken of, and

a decision given in its favour ; but if such were to any great extent indulged in,

Plymouth would be injured by so doing. Dr. Huxham's work proved the preva-

lence of ague, and changes by recovery of marsh lands and drainage had been the

--agents in its removal. Large tracts of land were recovered in the reign of William

and Mary Chelson Meadow (175 acres) by Lord Morley, and other large tracts at

Maristowe, Landulph, Ernesettle, &c. The last of these marshes, between Ply-

mouth and Devonport, had been removed in the time of those still living. As

intimately associated with this part of his subject attention must be particularly

directed to the excellent water supplied to Plymouth by Sir Francis Drake. As

supplied in its unfiltered state it was found to be as follows :--Free ammonia, 0-02

per  million                                     albuminoid ammonia, 0-09.  After filtration through a silicated
                                              ;
--part
carbon filter :  Free ammonia, 0-05 ; albuminoid ditto,                     - 03               solids  in  grains  per
                                                                                            ;

gallon, equal 4 grains. This water was unequalled, and not surpassed even in the

town supply of Glasgow. While speaking thus highly of the town water, he would

advise the local wells of Plymouth to be carefully kept, as these supplied a goodly

proportion of lime salts, and would prevent by their use very much of the rickets

which prevailed amongst children, and leueorrhcea in women. The insufficient

supply and bad quality of the milk, as well as overcrowding, had very much to do
Awith the prevalence of rickets.
                                                 registration of disease was much required to

make known the extent of this and other diseases, which did not affect the death-

--rate, but diminished very materially the efficiency of the population a point so

judiciously remarked on by Earl Fortescue in his presidential address. By a com-

parison of the death-rates of this town at different periods they would at once be

able to notice the value of sanitary improvements. The death-rate of Plymouth in

1829 was 35-7 per 1,000; 1811, 357j 1841-1850,25; 1851-1800,24; 1861-1870,

23; 1871-1876, 21-75; and during the past six months ending June, 1877, 21.

Zymotic death -rate in last six months, 1-5. The density of population in Plymouth

had been doubled in the period between 1841 and 1870. Prom 1841-50 the acres

to a person were 0-4; in 1851-60, 0-3; and in 1861-70, 0'2. The periods of

doubling of the population had been sixty years before 1800, and thirty years since

that date. If the paper read by Sir James Watson received that attention to

which it was justly due they shall see the death-rate in Plymouth still further

reduced. The great advantage of increased cubic space in military barracks showed

how much of consumption was removable by the increase of cubic space. This

evil of overcrowding, the density of population, and the large number of emigrants

(10,000 annually) passing through Plymouth were amongst the chief causes of

epidemic diseases and the severity which they at times manifested.

On the Amendment of the Patent Laws, referring to several points not hitherto
                             discussed. By Thomas Morgan.

 --The author said that inventions were of two classes major and minor. The

major referred to those embracing' principles of processes or constructions, such
as Giffard's injector, Bessemer's steel process, &c. ; the minor referred to
mere improvements in detail, or to small matters too numerous to particularize.
The minor inventions were proposed to he, in the majority of cases, provided for
by improvements in the utility of Designs Act: that was by lengthening its
term of protection, decreasing its cost, and increasing its legal scope, provision

being made that provisional registration under the Designs Act should allow

of proceeding to a patent instead of complete registration under the said Act.

Mr. Morgan advocated various amendments with regard to the practical operation

of the present patent laws, such as could be effected without fresh legislation, and
which would avoid the necessity of instituting a body of technical examiners, the
objection to which had been fully shown by Mr. Bramwell. This should be coupled,

--however, with new legislation on one point only, namely, a large reduction of cost
    at least one half reduction in all the stages of the cost in the life of a patent
also the addition of a proper permanent commissioner (or commissioners) to the
present Commissioners of Patents, the idea being that codification and other

necessary improvements would hereafter follow.

            On Hospital Mortality. By Dr. Lawson Tait, F.B. C.S.

   The author said that in order to obtain a proper estimate of the quality of the
work done in any general hospital it was necessary to obtain exact information
concerning three factors ; and it was very much to be regretted that the method
of keeping hospital records was generally so careless and inefficient that it was a
very difficult matter to obtain correct data. After a great deal of trouble, how-
ever, he had been able to extract trustworthy figures from the records of 179
hospitals for a period of six years. The three factors required were the average
daily population of each hospital, the actual number of admissions from the 1st of
January to the 31st of December, and the total deaths occurring within the walls

of the building. Ey dividing the admissions by the average population a fio-ure

was obtained which might be termed the " activity " of the hospital (that is, the
number of cases treated per annum in each bed), and dividing 365 by the result
gives the mean residence. The death-rate is to be calculated as a percentage on
the admissions. Splitting the hospital up into four groups according to size, he
found tbat the activity diminished and the mortality increased just as did the size
of the hospital. Selecting amputation below the knee for injury as the best in-
stance for contrasting results, the author produced the following remarkable results,
and the figures showed conclusively that the causes of the increment of mortality
are intrinsic to the large hospitals, and therefore entirely, or almost entirelv.

avoidable :

The case of the Leeds Infirmary showed that it was possible, by improved hyo-iene
to bring- hospital mortality down nearly 2 per cent., and was done solely by* allow-
ing a larger floor area and cubic space to each patient. The state of St. Thomas's

Hospital was, in the author's opinion, greatly to be regretted, and should imme-

diately be altered.

                 School Banks. By the Rev. "W. Ttickwell, M.A.

   The writer, a master of a school, being painfully impressed with the reckless
expenditure of pocket-money, adopted the system of penny banks established in

--the primary Belgian schools. He adopted two systems a current account with

no interest, and a deposit account with 10 per cent, interest on the money being
left undisturbed throughout the school term. The bank was opened in January
1876, and, up to the present time, the result had been most satisfactory.

                On Improving the Sanitary Condition of Large Towns.

                                 By Sir James Watson.

   There are few subjects more interesting or important than those which relate to
the general health of the community, and particularly to that of the sanitary con-
dition of large and populous cities. These affect not only the physical but also the
moral state of society. If our population are huddled together in wretched dwel-
lings, so old and ill-ventilated as to be almost untenantable, or so damp and con-
fined from want of sufficient breathing-space as to render them alike unwholesome
and dismal, can it be wondered at if such population should either resort to stimu-
lating drinks to relieve their physical depression, or seek for enjoyment beyond
their own homes ?

   That such a state of things shoidd exist to a considerable extent in most of our

large cities is much to be deplored, and it is only of late that the public have been
awakened to the importance of providing against this serious evil. The author

mentioned that the city of Glasgow has been one of the first to set the example of
seeking to remedy these defects. The city of Edinburgh, to a limited extent, fol-
lowed, and it is satisfactory to know that other towns are about to follow their
example. In the session of 1860 the author had occasion to bring under the notice
of the Social Science Association, at their meeting in Glasgow, the then existing
state of the lower portions of the city, showing that in these the population, which
numbered from 400 to 1000 in an acre, were crowded together in pent-up lanes or
closes of about three and four feet wide, with large tenements of three and four
stories rising on each side and running backwards to the extent of 250, and in some
cases 280 feet, into which neither the light nor air of heaven could freely penetrate.

A large portion of these dwellings were dark, dismal, and unwholesome, devoid of

comfort and family accommodation, and inhabited chiefly by the lower and cri-

minal class of the population. When fever or contagious disease broke out in

these places the results were appalling. As an instance of this, it has been shown

that, even as late as 1871, in one district known as the Ilavannah and New Vennel,

where the population amounted to 3200, 803 fever patients and 16 smallpox

m --patients were one year removed to hospital at the public expense in all 319, or

10 per cent, of the population. The death-rate was 70 in the thousand. The
moral disease in these districts was not less appalling, the houses being to a large

extent receptacles of pauperism, disease, and crime. What rendered this state of

things more distressing was the fact that a fresh stream of people from the country,
seeking employment, were each year pouring into the city ; that from the want of
cheap dwellings these people were driven into those haunts, and though respectable
when they entered, they very soon fell, by contact with their neighbours, to the
same low level.

   To remedy this state of things, measures were adopted by the Corporation, at
the instigation and under the presidency of Lord Provost Biackie. The city was
surveyed with the view of clearing out those objectionable districts, and plans
were drawn out with the view of obtaining an Act of Parliament, showing the
portions of the city necessary to be dealt with, and scheduling every tenement

required for carrying out the scheme.

   The plan was a bold and extensive one, seeking to sweep away whole streets of
unwholesome houses in order to obtain breathing-spaces, and to form broad, spa-
cious streets and open spaces in their stead, selling the vacant ground for this pur-
pose. Power was asked to expend £1,250,000 in the purchase of property, and to
assess by taxation (jd. per £ on rental for five years, and 3d. per £ for ten years.
 The scheme, as originally devised, covered an area of 88 acres of overbuilt ground,

and included the formation of new streets and improvement of old thoroughfares
to the number of forty-five.

In the Parliamentary Session of 1866 the Improvement Act was passed almost

·without opposition, and immediately thereafter a committee was appointed for

Acarrying out its provisions, over which committee I presided for six years.                            tax

of Or/, per £ on the rental of the city, to be paid by occupiers, was imposed for the

first year. Negotiations were entered into for the purchase of properties, and a
bank credit was arranged for until the tax could be collected and money borrowed

on the security of the trust. As many of the properties required were old and

dilapidated, the owners were generally not averse to quit them ; and from care
and skill on the part of their manager, Mr. Lamb, the committee succeeded for a

considerable time in purchasing at a very moderate rate--in many cases from ten

to twelve and fourteen years' purchase of the gross rental for dwellings, and

eighteen to twenty years' for shops. By the end of the first year the committee

had secured, by private bargain, property to the extent of £50,512, and loans had
begun to come in freely on the security of the trust at the rate of 4 per cent, per
annum. These purchases have gone on from year to year, and, as will be seen from

the published accounts, the sum paid for properties up till 31st May last amounted

to £1,612,504, of which they have sold to the extent of £830,532. In addition to

this the committee purchased and paid £40,000 for a public park for the use of the

citizens. The whole of these purchases have been made by private negotiations
and friendly arbitration, with the exception of two cases of trial by jury. The
principle laid down by the committee, which has been adhered to amidst strenuous
opposition, was to begin no improvement until the whole property in the district
had been purchased, and also to take care that both sides of the streets should be
secured. They consider the adherence to this principle the means by which they
have been able to secure properties at a moderate rate, and so promote the success

of the scheme.

The tax, which was 6d. per £ for the first year, was, in the second, reduced to

4rf., at which it was continued for four years, viz. till 1871. Afterwards it was

reduced to 3d. for two years, and since then to 2d. per £, at which it now stands.

In about two years after the passing of the Act there was commenced that pro-

cess of demolition which has been carried on gradually up to the present time, by

which old and dilapidated buildings were removed, the haunts of the criminal

classes broken up, breathing-spaces opened in pent-up lanes and closes, playgrounds

procured for children, old streets widened, and new streets driven through the

most densely crowded districts. The effects of these changes on the health of the

inhabitants, and more particularly on that of the children, have been very striking,

the procuring of open playground having in many cases wholly changed their sickly

appearance into that of robust health. During the first four years the operations

of the committee were chiefly confined to the purchase of property, to the putting

into temporary repair many of the worst dwellings, and particularly in taking down

and removing tenements of houses which were dens of fever and disease in the

crowded districts.

 --As recorded in the information given to the Home Secretaiy : "It was feared

at one time that the dispersion of the low-class population might have a tendency

to spread crime and disease, and was a dangerous experiment. None of these fears

have been verified ; on the contrary, the police and sanitary inspectors have re-

peatedly certified that the whole condition of the population displaced has been

improved, and ' that although paying higher rents in other districts of the citv for

houses  worthy     of  the  name,  they  are  themselves  satisfied  of  the  advantages             1  the

                                                                                          of

change.'" The information furnished to the Government of the operations of the
Trust, and a visit from the Home Secretary, led to Mr. Cross bringing in and pass-

ing the "Artisans' Dwellings Bill."

The clearances thus effected, along with the other clearances made by the Union

Railway Company, have led to a diminution of crime, and have, besides, given a

power and control to the police over the parties inhabiting these districts not for-

merly possessed. It is consequently found, that while between the years 1867 and

1873 there is a diminution in the total cases of crime annually reported of 3030,

there is an increase      in the apprehensions of   749.   The criminal returns give the

                "
--184 report 1877.

Total apprehensions in 1867, 5042 ; in 1873, 5791. This in the face of an increase
in the population of 57,483 during that period."

  --In giving his report in 1871 the chief constable says: "Through the operations

of the City Improvement and the Union Railway the city has been cleared of the
foulest dens of crime and profligacy, and their occupants been scattered amongst a
population breathing a purer moral atmosphere, thereby affording facilities to the
police for bringing the vicious to justice more easily and certainly than when the
whole formed a concentrated and combined colony of ruffianism." The death-rate,
which was 29 per 1000 in 1866, was 25 in 1876 ; should this differerence of 4 con-
tinue, it would show a saving of life (counting the population at 500,000) of 2000
annually. So many circumstances, however, affect this, that we dare not impute it
wholly to these operations, or trust entirely to its continuance.

    In about five years after the passing of the Act, the Committee began to dispose
of the ground for carrying out the Improvement plans, care was taken not to put

much in the market at one time, and the prices realized have exceeded their expec-

--tations in some cases more than sufficient to recoup them, in others less ; but the

prices realized have been on the whole most satisfactory. In every case the ground
has been sold by public sale.

   When the operations of the Committee began to be seen, and the want of work-

men's houses began to be felt (a want which had existed for some time previously),
builders immediately commenced the erection of such dwellings. The rage for
building these went on from year to year; new streets of houses of this description
have sprung up, until the supply is now in excess of the demand.

    In an able pamphlet on this subject by Mr. Morrison, the present able and active

chairman of the committee, it is shown, that since the passing of the Act, now ten

years, there have been provided 40,460 houses within the municipality, giving
accommodation for 202,320 persons, while within a radius of half a mile of the city
there has been provided a further accommodation for not less than 100,000, making
accommodation for 302,300, to meet the natural increase of the population and
the 28,965 persons displaced by the Improvement Act. In alluding to the accom-
modation thus provided, he says, " he believes it constitutes a fact unprecedented
in the history of any city, not even excepting Chicago itself."

   In the early stages of their displacements, some fears existed on the part of the
committee as to finding accommodation for the population so displaced, and two
large lots of building-ground in the immediate vicinity of the town, and costing
about £74,000, were therefore purchased, so as to give ground to builders at
moderate rates for erecting such houses. The plau proved eminently successful,
and has resulted in a profit of about £30,000. In the displacement of so many,
the Committee found that there were living in these localities certain poor persons
unable to pay for more than the most miserable accommodation, viz. Is. or Is. 6d.

per week. To provide for such, and as a single apartment in the new buildings
could not be had under £5 or £5 5s. per annum, or say from 6s. 8r/. to 8s. 3d. per
month, the Committee erected Model Lodging Houses in six different quarters of

the city, the cost of lodging, including fire, gas, and cooking utensils being 3|c?.
per night, or Is. 9^/. per week, Sunday being allowed gratis. These have been
taken advantage of to a large extent, and, while self-supporting, have enabled the
inmates to live with more security and in a more healthy atmosphere than that in

which they were previously located. As yet there has been no case of infectious
disease in any of these houses. These, with the exception of a Model Tenement in
Drygate, are the only buildings which have been erected by the Committee, the
others having been done by private enterprise.

   Lastly, as to cost. The property sold and what is on hand, moderately valued,

amounted on 31st May 'last to £1,647,332, while the sums paid amount to

£1,612,504, showing a difference of £34,828 in favour of the improvements ; so that

these, properly speaking, may be said to have paid themselves. Taxes, however,

have been raised to the extent of £283,462, and there is still to raise, at 2d. per £,

for four years, £80,000, making in all £363,462. From this has to be deducted
price of a public park, purchased and made over to the citizens, £40,000. If from
this we deduct eighteen acres of most valuable ground thrown into streets, and
open spaces valued at not less than £100,000, and a further sum for paving streets
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      185

 and for construction of sowers, say £65,000, you reduce the actual cost of the im-
 provements to £178,462, arising from waste rents, interest of ground remaining for
a time unbuilt upon before being sold, parliamentary expenses, and expenses of
management. In this estimate the author has been anxious not to give the most
favourable view of the case.

    The result of the operations of the Committee has been entirely to renovate large
portions of the city. Wide and handsome streets, with large spacious shops and
dwellings, have taken the place of narrow streets and lanes, of old and dilapidated
buildings. The narrow closes, where the criminal classes were wont to combine
for all sorts of crimes, and from whence they nightly sallied out to rob and plunder,
have given place to respectable dwellings. Fever-dens have been extirpated, and,
by the aid of the Sanitary Committee, the death-rate has been in these districts

greatly reduced. Many of the vicious who inhabited these localities being driven

from them, have been forced either to labour or to emigrate. The moral effect
produced it is not easy fully to ascertain, and this effect can only be gradual. It
must, however, be apparent to every one that there are few things more likely to
raise the tone of the working classes than clean and comfortable homes in healthy
localities and respectable neighbourhoods.

   The author is glad to find that the important town of Birmingham is proposing
to engage in the good work ; and he hopes the result of what has been done in
Glasgow will be sufficient to encourage other towns throughout the kingdom,

"where reform of this kind is wanted, to follow the example.

Oil a proposed Reduction to System of the ' Modifications] or Privileges to
   work Overtime, which are granted under the Factory Acts to particular

  Trades. By Sir George Young, Bart.

After a preface claiming that the Factory Acts, if rightly considered, were not

out of harmony with the principles of political economy, and were even a good

exemplification of the principles of legislation which are founded on political eco-

--nomy, the paper proceeded, " The principal enactments under which overtime can

be worked are these: 1. Provisions for leave to be given to " season trades " to

work overtime to the extent of 1| or 2^ hours in the day, for a maximum of 72 or
96 days. This applies in some cases to women and boys over 14; in others to

women and boys over 10. The list includes the makers of wearing apparel, Christ-

mas goods, &c. 2. Exemptions of lads of 16 from the provisions of the Acts, so

that they may be worked as adults. 3. Permission to work "according to the

accustomed hours of the trade," which amounts, in fact, to an almost entire absence

of regulation. This applies to paper-making and Turkey red dyeing. 4. Suspen-

sion of the Acts for particular emergencies, such as the danger of spontaneous com-

bustion in Turke3r red dyeing and the gutting and salting of fish immediately on

their arrival in the boats. 5. Permissions for night-work in the case of boys over

1-'!. The metal trades, blast-furnaces and foundries, and paper-making profit by

these. The working of females at night has never been permitted. 6. Water-

in iwer manufactories have been allowed to make up for time lost by flood or

drought ; but the recent course of legislation has been adverse to the privileges.

7. Half an hour's extra time is allowed to bleach-works and glass-blowing to finish

an incomplete process. There are also miscellaneous enactments, consulting the

requirements of Jewish employers, of lace factories, glass foundries, &c. The com-

plexity of these rules occasions great difficulty in ascertaining and administering

the law. The commissioners recommend that they should be simplified, upon a

--plan of which the following are the leading principles : 1. They did not interfere

with the prohibition of female labour at night. 2. The regulations permitting

night-work to boys of 13 would be by their recommendations altered so aa to limit

tho minimum age to 14. 3. They desired to limit, so far as possible, the oppor-

tunities of working overtime. 4. They recommend that these privileges should

be conceded to whole trades and not to particular trades, on personal application

but as this would enormously increase tho opportunities of working overtime,

they propose to diminish considerably the maximum which is allowed to be worked.

1877.                                 15
--186 report 1877.

5. They leave to the Secretary of State a discretionary power to extend the privi-

lege to other trades which fall within the same principle. 6. All exercise of such
discretionary power to be subject to the assent of Parliament, obtained by laying

the authority for a fixed period on the table of the House. 7. Privileges of re-

covery of lost time to be reduced to the same rule as those of working overtime.
8. All privileges to work u according to the custom of the trade," or for the ex-

emption of boys of 10 from the supervision of the law, are disapproved. The

--classes of trades which are defined by the commissioners for enjoyment of the pri-

vilege of working overtime are : 1, trades where the material is perishable, and is

brought to market in large quantities at one time, as curing of tish, preserving of

fruit, &c. ; 2, trades wheie stoppage is caused by weather emergency, as open-ail
bleaching, brick-making, and (if that form of claim is still to be allowed) mills

worked by water-power; 3, trades liable to emergency from a sudden press of

orders, as dressmaking, letterpress printing, &c. ; 4, trades liable to similar emer-

gency from a press of orders which can be, to some extent, foreseen and provided

against, as printers of almanacks and periodicals, Christinas goods makers, and

some provision trades. In these latter cases they propose, as an additional check,
that the overtime worked shall be repaid out of the ordinary time when the emer-

gency is past." In conclusion, the author expressed a hope that this classification

would find its way into the draft of the Factory Consolidation Act before it came

--on again for consideration in Parliament. He said : " In legislation, as in every

other Act, it is most mischievous to talk as if it proceeded, here and there, in con-

travention of scientific principles. Science all the while stands patiently waiting,
Wewith her hands full of gifts, which are principles.
                                                       come to her, like children,

for a gift ; and, having received it, we run away and put it to all manner of uses,
for some of which it is unsuited, till it breaks in our hands. Those who return,

time after time, to the fountain of principles to rectify their general conclusions,

and learn to apply them more carefully, will not be disappointed in that exhaust-

less storehouse. When, therefore, in legislation an exception or group of excep-

tions has forced itself upon us, and broken up the symmetry of our system, it is the

part of a wise legislator to set to work to discover the principles which lie behind

these exceptions, and to reduce them, in their turn, to rule."

        Address by Edward Woods, Esq., C.E., President of the Section.

                                           [Plates III. & IV.]

In accordance with long-established usage it has been customary for the Presi-
dent of this as of the other Sections to open the proceedings of the Session by

giving an introductory address.
   Presuming on your land indulgence, I venture on this occasion to submit to

your notice some remarks on a subject which has latterly much engaged the

attention of the Railway Companies and of the Government, namely, the question
of the application of adequate brake-power to the coutrol of railway trains.

   In the summer of 1874 a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the

causes of accidents on railways, and into the possibility of removing any such causes
by further legislation.

   One branch of this inquiry naturally led to the consideration of the causes con-
tributory to accidents of the nature of collisions ; and it appeared from the evidence
taken before the Commissioners that not only was there generally an insufficiency
of controlling power in trains, but also that the distance within which a train
running at high speed could be stopped by the brake-power ordinarily in use was
not ascertained with any approach to accuracy.

    It was under these circumstances that the Commissioners applied to the Railway
Companies to institute a definite series of experiments to test the amount of control
given by the brake-power ordinarily applied to their trains, and the effect of various
systems of continuous brakes.
                          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                           187

    Several of the railway companies at onco, and willingly, responded to this sug-
gestion, and, in conjunction with Colonel Inglis, of the" .Royal Engineers, I was
entrusted by the Royal Commissioners with the supervision of an important series
of experiments, to the satisfactory conduct of which the Railway Companies con-
tributed in the most liberal manner, placing for the purpose all their resources at
the disposal of the Commissioners.

   It is mainly to the conduct of those experiments, and to the conclusions that

may be legitimately drawn therefrom, that I would now desire to invite the atten-
tion of the members of this Section, although I am aware that the subject is one
with which many gentlemen present are perfectly familiar.

   With a few exceptions, and up to a comparatively recent period, Railway Com-

panies appear to have remained content with the brake appliances which were

common forty years ago. These no doubt were sufficient to control the trains of

those early days, infrequent as they were in number, and limited both in weight and

speed.

   The brakes were applied separately and by hand power, always to the tender,
and usually to some few of the carriages, and to the guard's van, or vans if such
accompanied the train.

   As long ago as 1858, and consequent upon reports from their inspecting officers,

tin' Board of Trade had by a circular of their then secretary, Captain Douglas
Galton, called the special attention of the Railway Companies to the fact that the
amount of brake-power then habitually applied was insufficient to prevent the fre-

quent occurrence of accidents from collisions, many of which might, they consi-

dered, have been modified, or averted, had the trains been more adequately supplied
with brake-power. Special reference was directed to two systems which had
then come into daily use on the lines of the East Lancashire, and Lancashire and
Yorkshire railways, viz. the brakes of Newall and of Fay, by means of which
trains of ninety tons to a hundred tons weight, at speeds of over fifty miles an
hour, could be effectually controlled by driver or guard, even when running down
steep inclines, and could be brought up within a moderate distance ; whilst the
wear and tear of rolling-stock, it was alleged, was sensibly diminished by reason
of the more extensive distribution of brake-power over the vehicles of the train.

   In fact Mi*. Newall's brake had been patented five years before, viz. in 1853.

   It seems certainly matter for surprise, in view of the advantages afforded by the
application of continuous brakes, as then illustrated in the daily working of the
two systems referred to, on several lines of railway, that railway companies should
have continued to allow themselves to remain content with the old system, and
should have been so slow to avail themselves of advantages which were obviously
disclosed in the instances brought under their notice, wherein the brake-power was
largely augmented, and instead of being dependent for its due action on the atten-
tion of several attendants, was effectually placed under the immediate and prompt

control of one.

   This lethargy prevailed, too, throughout a period when increased speed came to
be demanded, when increasing traffic required heavier trains, and when conse-
quently more ponderous and powerful engines had to be applied for their transport
circumstances, all of which would have naturally, one would think, induced the

companies to effect simultaneously a corresponding readjustment and improvement

of their brake appliances.

It may here be of interest to glance briefly at the appliances which have been

used for controlling trains since tramways and railways have been introduced.

In the early tramways, the necessity for some means of control at once com-

manded attention, more especially as, in the wooden roads introduced in the North

of England and in South Wales during the last century, the course of the lines

was  made  to follow the    natural  inclinations  of  the  surface  of  the  country                             the
                                                                                                               ;

declivities being often rather steep, and the friction of the vehicles being small,

accidents arising from their too rapid descent were of frequent occurrence.

On most of these earlier lines the controlling power was of the simplest kind,

being produced by "spragging" the wheels, or, in other words, inserting a bar of

wood between the spokes, which prevented them from turning and converted the

motion from a rolling to a sliding one.

                                                                         15*
--188 report 1877.

   Brakes, in the proper sense of the term, appear to have come in with the intro-

duction of edge rails ; and we read of such being used on the Tyne and Wear Rail-

ways, where the wagons were controlled by pressing on the end of a bent wooden
lever moving on an axis fitted to the side of the wagon, and rubbing against the

opposite surfaces of the two wheels on that side of the wagom
   Here we have presented, in a rude form, the type of the ordinary lever brake now

generally in use in mineral and goods wagons.

   Such a form of brake, but moving on a vertical instead of a horizontal axis, is

in the present day, and probably has been almost from time immemorial, applied

to the ox-carts of Spain which travel on the common roads and mountain tracks of

that country conveying mineral and other produce.

   Such were the rude contrivances which maintained their ground until the close

of the first quarter of the present century, though here and there it may have been

that some thoughtful mechanic sought to introduce a more perfect mechanism.

   That such was the case in one instance is clear from the description, given in
1 Desagulier's Experimental Philosophy,' by Charles de Labelye, of a particular form

of brake which was applied early in last century, as the writer states, to the
" Carriages made use of by Ralph Allen, Esq., to carry stones from his quarry,
situated on the top of a hill, to the waterside of the River Avon near the City of

Bath."

   Here the rails were of oak, the wheels were of cast iron with flanges, the brake
a lever brake. The end of the brake-lever, or "jig-pole," as it is there termed, was
pulled down by a chain wrapped round a windlass worked by an iron hand spike,
whilst the brake-block could be held down to its place until released by raising the

pall which had dropped into the teeth of the ratchet-wheel on the barrel.

   Here we have the germ of the chain-brake, now so much used on the lines of

North America. Hand-brakes of improved construction, worked by levers as

applied to wagons, and by screws in the case of carriage?, were devised for the

rolling stock of the first passenger lines : and brakes of this description, varying in

the minor mechanical details, have maintained their ground to the present day,

and are generally used in the working of ordinary trains.

   It is scarcely necessary to advert to the fact that since the year 1830 many

attempts have been made, and patents taken out, for brakes intended to supersede

--those of the ordinary type some to be self-acting and operated upon by the

momentum of the train ; some to act as sledges or shoes ; some to nip laterally the

upper tables of the rails ; but nonejof these proved to be successful. Brakes acting

through the buffer-springs and buffer-bars would stop a train when steam was

shut  off, and  the  momentum tended to  compress the  springs                               but from the same
                                                                                          ;

cause the brakes could not be kept out of action when backing the trains. Sledge

brakes, or shoes, pressed down before the wheels had the effect of throwing the

engine or carriages off the rails, and, indeed, were often broken by the shocks which

suddenly came upon them.

All these forms, therefore, came to be rejected, and if ever adopted for the regular

service of trains, were speedily abandoned.

The continuous brakes of Newall and Fay, however, did not involve auy new

principle of this kind, but simply proposed a wider distribution of power over the

different vehicles of the train, and gave the means of applying and controlling that

power by one or at most by two attendants.

   It is in this direction that the ingenuity of inventors has of late years been

turned and we have now presented to us several systems of continuous brakes,
                                 ;

which are successfully working on many of our leading railways, each claiming some

special advantage over its rivals, whether as more simple in construction, less

expensive in application, or effecting more complete control of the trains.

The Royal Commissioners desired that our attention should be primarily

directed to the following points :

      a. To test the distances within which trains running at various speeds can

                be controlled by the system of brakes in ordinary use on the different

                lines in the United Kingdom.

      b. To ascertain what results can be obtained by the additional application of

                brake-power.
          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  189

         c. To determine how far the sudden application of a very large amount of

                       brake-power can he resorted to with safety in heavy trains running-

                       at high speed.

  A special Committee of the Railway Companies' Association, on which Mr.

Oakley, the General Manager of the Great Northern Railway Company, sat as
Chairman, was appointed to confer with us as to the course the experiments should

take, the trains that should he furnished for the purpose, and the ground on which

the trials should he conducted.

  We selected for this latter purpose the portion of the Nottingham and Lincoln

branch of the Midland Railway which extends from Newark to Thurgaton, as

offering a piece of line comparatively level and free from any sharp curves ; and

through the admirable arrangements made by the Midland Company, we were

enabled to carry on the experiments without interruption for the period of a whole
week, having free use of the down line of railway, the traffic both ways being
worked for the time over the up line.

   Six railway companies furnished for the trials eight complete trains with

engines and tenders complete. These trains represented as many systems of con-

tinuous brakes, comprising four classes, viz.

Class 3.    Clarke and Webb's brake.

   The ground chosen for the trial was measured and staked out with a view to

obtaining accurate records of the speed of the trains before and after the applica-

tion of the brakes.

   It was also levelled, and the gradients thereby carefully determined and laid
down in section. The part on which the brakes were generally applied was a dead

level. The War Office placed at our disposal the valuable services of Captain

(then Lieutenant) R. G. Scott and Lieutenant M. H. P. R. Sankey, of the Royal
Engineers, aided by twelve non-commissioned officers and men of that corps. With
their aid we were enabled to record in full detail, and with great accuracy, the

particulars of each train and of each experiment.

   The speed of the trains was ascertained by means of stop-watches, and to ensure

further correctness independent results were recorded by an electric instrument.
This was arranged to record in half seconds the time the trains should take to pass

over a definite number of the spaces. By clockwork arrangement a long slip of

paper was unwound from a drum and passed between rollers. The time corre-
sponding with half-second beats of the pendulum was marked upon the paper by
a pecker in red ink, and when the flange of the leading wheel of a train passed
one of the posts the instant was denoted by a mark in black ink made on the
paper slip by another pecker actuated hj a magnet. Opposite each post a circuit closer
was fixed to the inside edge of the rail, and when the flange of the wheel pressed
down the lever, the circuit was closed and the magnetic action induced.

   The time was measured by noting the positions on the tape of the black or space
dots with reference to the red or time dots, which denoted the half-second intervals.

   It was arranged that each train should correspond with that of an ordinary
fast passenger train, with average load consisting of engine, tender, thirteen

passenger carriages, and two brake-vans, and that each carriage should be loaded
with a weight corresponding with three quarters of a cwt. per seat, to represent an
average load of passengers with luggage, and that each van should be loaded with
190 REPORT--1877.

a weight of 2 tons, as representing the average weight of luggage it conveys. The
Companies had the option of using either 4-wheel" or 0-wheel carriages.

    Subject to those conditions the trains varied considerably in gross weight, which
ranged from 130 tons to 195 tons in respect of the fifteen loaded vehicles, and from
200 tons to 260 tons when the weight of engine and tender was included, the
heaviest trains being those of the Great Northern, and London and North-Western
.Railways, as being made up of 6-wheol carriages, all the other trains being furnished
with 4-wheel carriages.

    All the comparative trials, class by class, were made, as nearly as circumstances
would permit, at the same timo and under the like conditions of weather, state of

rails, &c.

   The trains were started from a point near Newark, about three miles from the
signal-post at which the signal to put on brakes was given, in order that they
might acquire the requisite speed. Owing to the differences in weights of trains,
and to the different powers of' the engines applied to them, it was not possible to
ensure equal rates of speed at the time of signalling to stop ; but by computing
the vis viva of the train in each case and dividing this by the stopping distance,
the mean retarding force is obtained in each case as a coefficient of the weight of

the train.

   The Royal Commissioners were desirous that, if possible, some graphic mode of
presenting the results should be arranged, so that by a glance, and without the
need of reference to the Tables which would of course accompany our Report, the

relative efficiency of the different brakes might be seen.

   We accordingly devised the means of doing this by diagrams, of which the one

now before the Section is a specimen (Plate III.).

   We were led to this method of exhibiting the duty done by the following con-

siderations :

   The work done from first to last in the act of stopping a train by brake-power,
or otherwise, is necessarily equal to the vis viva or accumulated work which the
train possessed at the moment of commencing the stop *.

   The vis viva which a train possesses at any moment is that which it would have

acquired in falling vertically through the height required to produce the assigned
velocity in a body falling freely from a state of rest under the action of gravity.

   Thus the vis viva destroyed in the act of stopping is represented by the weight
of the train lifted through the vertical height in question, the condition necessary
being that the vis viva can only be exhausted by the train rising on any given
gradient to the height due to its velocity.

   Supposing, then, that at a given point of its course the propelling power of a
train should be suddenly arrested, and that at the same point it should be made to
enter upon a rising gradient, it would continue to run (setting aside for the moment
the question of friction) until it reached a point on that plane the vertical elevation
of which shall be equal to the height which would suffice to produce the particular
velocity which the train had attained on reaching the foot of the gradient.

    If the gradient be a gentle one, the distance run before the train is brought to a
stop will be considerable, and in proportion to its increasing steepness so will the

run be shortened.
   Taking such gradient as a convenient measure of the forces applied to stop a

train, its effect is represented by the inclination of that gradient, taking its height
as that due to the initial velocity and its length as the distance traversed during

the stoppage.

  A diagram can therefore be constructed by setting off by scale, from a zero point

on the base line, a gradient the length of which shall equal that of the distance of
the stop and its height the vertical height through which a body falling from a
state of rest would attain the observed velocity of the train at the time of the
commencement of the stop.

   This becomes the measure of all the forces concerned in producing the stop,

                                                                               2

 inclusive of brake-power, friction, and gravity, which latter force comes also into
 operation either positively or negatively, according as the stop is effected on an

 ascending or descending portion of the railway.

    The retarding force assumed as uniformly acting throughout the period of the

 stop, such as friction, or brake-power, or gravity, or all combined, can therefore be
 compared with and measured by the force of gravity acting on a gradient opposed

 to the motion of the train.
    That force, as measured by the supposed gradient, admits of being expressed

in various ways, but preferably for our purpose (as we considered) by referring the

 vertical height of the plane to its length as a percentage of the latter.

    The figure representing that percentage will of course also represent the effect
 of gravity on that plane ; and is therefore the coefficient of the weight of the

 train.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .
    The course of our experiments, which extended over the period of a week,

comprised several series: one for ascertaining the friction of the carriages and
 van*, apart from the application of any brake or other retarding power under the
 control of the attendants; another for determining the frictional resistance of the
 engines and tenders ; and lastly one for measuring the value of break application

 under varied combinations.

                                         1. Fbiction of Carriages.

    Six trains of fifteen vehicles each, but detached from their respective engines
and tenders, were propelled successively past the zero or signal post, where the

propelling power was suddenly withdrawn, when the trains were allowed to run

freely forward until they stopped.

    The speeds at the zero post ranged from 27 to 42^ miles per hour.
    The distances run during the stop ranged from li to 3 miles.
    The Great-Northern train, weighing 199 tons, at 42i miles per hour, stopped in
a length of 15,189 feet ; the London and North-Western train, 188 tons at 42 miles
per hour, in 15,054 feet--giving a mean retarding force in those particular trains

of -35 per cent, of their weight, or about 8 lbs. per ton.

   The mean of the entire series gave a slightly higher figure.

                             2. Friction of Engine and Tender.

   In like manner it was found that the friction of engine and tender coupled
together, no brakes being applied, amounted to -62 per cent, of their combined

weight, being about 14 lbs. per ton.

   Hence it may be assumed that the friction of a complete train (in which the

weight of engine and tender constitutes, say, one fourth of the gross weight of the

train), inclusive of the atmospheric resistance it encounters in its course, may be

taken at -42 per cent., being about 9| lbs. per ton.

   These results confirm what long experience would lead us to anticipate.

                                   3. Effect of Hand-Brakes.

   With the exception of a few passenger trains of some of the leading com-
panies, the bulk of the passenger traffic of the railways in this country had been

conveyed in trains possessing hand-brakes, one to the tender, and one to each van,
the former worked by the stoker, the latter by the guards.

   It thus became important, in the view of the Royal Commissioners, to ascortain
with precision what is the controlling power which these appliances afford._

   The suitable trains were those furnished bv five of the Railway Companies, viz.
the London and North Western, the Caledonian, the Midland, the Great Northern,
and the London Brighton and South Coast, when it was found that the total mean
retarding force induced bv the application of hand-brakes to tender and to the two

vans amounted, inclusive of ordinary friction, to 2-30 per cent, of the gross weight

equivalent to encountering a gradient of 2-36 per cent., or 1 in 42. The mean
-ross weight of these trains, including engine and tender, was 220 tons, and their
mean speed at the time of cutting off steam was 47 1 miles per hour. _

   The effect of such brakes was, in fact, such as that on a level railway a train
--192 report 1877.

running at 45 miles per hour -would be stopped in the space of 10CO yards, or if at

CO miles per hour in the space of 1700 yards or about mte mile.

   The necessity for some greater control oyer fast passenger trains than that
afforded by hand- brakes to engine and vans was rendered obvious by such a

result, and" the .Royal Commissioners accordingly reported as follows :
   " It appears that the amount of hand-brake power usually provided with the

trains of the respective Companies failed to bring up the London and North-

Western train within 2374 feet ; that of the Caledonian within 311'0 feet ; that of

--the Midland within 3250 feet ; that of the Great Northern within 3570 feet ; and

that of the Brighton within 3G90 feet the speed of the trains varying from 45-5

miles to 48-5 miles per hour.

" These trains were in the most complete order, and the guards and drivers had

notice of the exact spot at which the signal to stop would be given.

  A" large addition must therefore be made to these distances in practice, and

unless much greater control is obtained over trains by additional brake-power, it

is clear that to ensure safety the distance signals must, for a level line, be carried

back to the distance of a mile."

It is to be observed also that from the want of a larger amount of brake-power

much time is lost on the journey when the stoppages are frequent, the drivers being-

compelled to slacken speed at such long distances from the stopping-places.

The suburban lines have not been slow to recognize this advantage, and hence

continuous brakes have been generally introduced on the North London and on

the underground lines of the Metropolis.

   It seems, indeed, scarcely to admit of question that a system, which may be

deemed almost a necessity in such special cases, would not be advantageously

applicable in all cases, and that, in fact, to render the control of a train complete

brakes should be adapted to all or nearty all its wheels, and that at least the

driver if not the guards should possess the power of promptly bringing the whole

of them into action.

The truth of this principle seems to be now very generally admitted by all our

leading Railway Companies, and it will be seen, from a return made by them

recently to the Board of Trade, that they appear to be fully alive to its import-

ance ; that some of them have adopted systems of continuous brakes which in their
judgment answer the ends desired; and that others are preparing to make trial of

inventions which promise better results.

It was not part of our duty to the Royal Commissioners to select for coinmc n-

Wedation any one or more of the systems presented for trial.     had only to

conduct the trials with all possible care, and to record faithfully the facts which

those trials disclosed.

It is true that some rather startling disparities in the operation of the different

systems of brakes were disclosed during the course of our experiments ; but this

we considered might, to a certain extent, have been fairly expected from the cir-
cumstance that many of the contrivances were of comparatively recent origin, and

that from want of sufficient time some of the mechanical details had to be hastily

settled, and could not therefore be properly tested and corrected beforehand.

   Some of these disparities, however, appeared to be incidental to the principle
upon which the action of the brake was founded, and in particular we had to
notice the marked effect resulting from the differences in the intervals which

elapsed between the times of applying the power and the times when the pressure

on the blocks attained its full effect, as between the air pressure and vacuum
breaks we noticed a loss of 6J seconds, which, in a train running 60 miles per hour,

is equivalent to 180 yards additional space traversed in the stop.

Brief mention has already been made of the systems of continuous brakes sub-

mitted for trial. There were :

1. Two forms of brake in which the power was transmitted by wheels, chains,

      rods, and levers, viz. Clarke and Webb's (London and North Western)
       and Fay's (Lancashire and Yorkshire).

2. Two forms in which the power applied was that of the pressure of the

      atmosphere induced by vacuum formed in pipe and vessels, viz. the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  193

              Westinghouse vacuum (London, Brighton, and South Coast) and Smith's
              vacuum (Great Northern Railway).
      3. Two forms in which the power was that of compressed air forced through
              a continuous pipe into suitable vessels and operating upon pistons : West-
              inghouse's Automatic (Midland), Steel and MTimes' (Caledonian).

      4. Two forms in which the power was transmitted by pressure of water

             pumped through a continuous pipe against pistons working in cylinders :

               Barker's Hydraulic (Midland), Clarke's Hydraulic (Midland).

   These brakes have been so frequently described in detail that it may not be

needful to do more than glance at some of the points hi respect of which they

differ.

   Of the mechanical brakes, Fay's is worked by hand-gear in two separate sections,
actuated each from its own van. Blocks are drawn on to the wheels by means of

a shaft passing under the centre of each carnage, with sliding-jointed connexions

rendering it continuous throughout each section of the train, and made to rotate

by a vertical shaft and hand-gear in the van.
    Clarke and Webb's brake is also applied to the train in sections, but the power to

work it is derived from the momentum of the train itself. This is transmitted by

means of a friction-pulley fixed on to the axle of the guard's van. Another fric-
tion-pulley, with barrel and chain on the same axis, is brought into contact with
the first by the guard releasing a lever in the van. The chain is thus wound up,
forcing the brake-blocks on to the wheels. The driver, too, is able to put on the
brakes by pulling a cord which extends from the tender to the vans.

    Fay's brake, and also NewaU's, which it closely resembles, have been generally
adopted throughout the Lancashire and Yorkshire system, where they have been
in use for twenty years, and it is stated that all the passenger-trains are fitted with
and controlled by them.

   On the North-Staffordshire line all the passenger-trains, with one exception, have
been fitted with slide-brakes after the manner of Fay's, and these, the Company

state, have been found to answer the requirements of the line.

   No train fitted with Newall's Brake was presented to the Royal Commissioners

for trial. In addition, however, to its use on the Lancashire and Yorkshire system,
it has been adopted since 1863 on the Highland Railway for all their through

passenger-trains.

   The London and South-Western Company has applied it to 110 of their brake-
vans, and the North-Eastern Railway to 55 vans, as also to some of their carriages.

    Clarke and Webb's brakes have been extensively adopted on the London and
North-Western system. According to a published return as many as 943 of their
carriages have been fitted with the brake apparatus, and 712 with the attachments
to enable them to be worked in the continuous sections. The remainder of the
stock is being thus fitted. On the North-London line twenty-three trains are run-
ning with an improved brake, which is gradually displacing Clarke's original chain-
 brake, with which all the trains were fitted about twelve years ago. Trials of the
brake have been made on the Caledonian, Great Eastern, and Great Northern and
Midland lines.

   In the Westinghouse Vacuum Brake and Smith's Vacuum Brake the exhaustion
 of air is effected by one or more air-ejectors worked by steam-jet fixed on tho
 engine. To apply the brakes it is only necessary to exhaust the air from the pipes,

 which, in the case of the Westinghouse, connect with a pair of cylinders with
 pistons placed under each carriage ; and, in the case of Smith's, with collapsing-
 India-rubber bags or cylinders, one to each carriage, and the movable ends of which
 are connected with the brake-gear of their respective carriages.

    In the first and rear van of the Great Northern train thus fitted with Smith's
 brake was an air-exhauster, worked as might be required by means of friction-
 wheels from the van-axle, to enable the application of brakes to be made on an
 emergency and independently of the Ejectors. These Exhausters are also started
 by the action of the Ejectors.

    The Westinghouse Vacuum Brake is used on the London, Brighton, and South
 Coast line, and in the train which was made the subject of several of our experi-
--194 report 1877.

incuts                                   at Lincoln                                           but  its  application  in  this country has  been greatly superseded
                                                                                           ;

by the later inventions of Mr. Westinghouse, in which compressed air is made the

motive power. On the other hand, Smith's Vacuum Brake nas been adopted with

advantage in all the trains of the Metropolitan Railway Company ; and it has been

so far approved by the Great Northern Railway Company that they have already

fitted fifty engines and 168 carriages, aud are preparing to fit more of their stock

as fast as they can procure the material. The Great Eastern, Great Western,

Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire, Midland, South Eastern, North Eastern,

North British, and Lancashire and Yorkshire railways have applied it to a more

limited extent, some of them by way of experiment.

                                                                                                        COMPEESSED-AlR BbAKES.

Of the Compressed-Air Brakes, the system most extensively introduced is the

Westinghouse, which in its latest form has been made automatic.

In this system air is forced under a pressure of about 60 lbs. per square inch into

a main reservoir of about 1) cubic feet capacity placed underneath the foot-plate,

and a line of tubing extends therefrom throughout the tram. Each vehicle is

fitted with a small reservoir and a brake cylinder, the reservoirs and tubing through-

out being filled with compressed air at a uniform pressure. By reducing the

pressure in the main to a slight extent, valves are opened which permit the air to

enter the cylinders and press the brakes home. The severance of the main pro-

duces the like effect.

In the Steel-McInnes system there are two main-pipes. Each carriage carries a

vertical cylinder, with piston and rod to communicate the pressure to the brake-

gear, and a small air receiver on its lower end. Receivers, cylinders, and con-

necting pipes throughout are kept charged with compressed ah- by means similar

to those of the Westinghouse ; and to apply the brakes a differential pressure on
the pistons is established by opening a cock which allows the compressed air to

escape from above the pistons. The same action follows if the pressure of air in

the pipes be relieved by any accidental disconnexion of them.

The Westinghouse Automatic Air-pressure Brake has been rather extensively

adopted on the Midland and the North British Railways ; on the Midland 57

engines and 166 carriages have been fitted wdth them, and many more vehicles
are in progress of fitting. The North British Company have fitted 15 engines and
100 carriages, and purpose increasing the number as may be required. They state

that they have adopted this brake as being, in their opinion, the best that has yet

been devised.

The London, Chatham, and Dover, the North-Eastern, the Caledonian, the

Glasgow and South-Western, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways have

fitted or are fitting up engines and carriages for trial of this form of brake.

Hitherto the application of Steel and MTnnes' Brake appears to be limited to

the Caledonian Railway, where it has been in use for two years on the Edinburgh

and Glasgow section.

The Hydraulic Brakes of Barker and Clarke are worked by water under pressure,

conveyed through continuous tubing along the length of the train. The pressure

is obtained in Barker's by a double-acting steam-accumulator on the engine ; and
in Clarke's by a loose piston, without a rod, resting in its normal position at the

bottom of a vertical cylinder, filled with water, fixed under the foot-plate of the

engine                                   when steam from the                                            boiler  is admitted beneath,       the water is  driven into
                                      ;

the tube and thence into the carnage cylinders. In Barker's each carriage is fitted

with a pair of cylinders on rams, in Clarke's each carriage carries a single cylinder.
The brakes were not arranged in the experimental trains to be self-acting in case

of a train parting asunder.

On the Midland Railway two engines and twenty-six carriages have been fitted

with Barker's brakes and are there working ; and it has also been tried on the

Monmouthshire section of the Great Western Railway, as also on the Crystal

Palace line of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway.

  I am not aware that Clarke's Hydraulic Brake has been fitted to any other train

than that of the experimental train of the Midland Railway, which was the subject

pf trial at Lincoln.

         Results of Lincoln Expebiments with Continuous Bbajtes.

    The experiments to ascertain the effect of Continuous Brakes were arranged in
several groups, three of which involved the application of all available power for
stopping, sand being allowed to be used in two sets of trials out of the three. It
was found that the application of sand, in combination with brake-power, added
sensibly to the stopping-power, and on an average might be estimated as giving an
addition of 1-30 per cent, to the retarding force otherwise brought into play. The
trains were stopped by flag-signal, the driver and guards doing the utmost the
means afforded them allowed for bringing the train to a stop in the shortest pos-
sible distance. Not using sand, the retarding forces operating were found to range
in the respective trains from 4 1)4 to 1004 per cent, of their weights, corresponding

with the effects which would be produced by the trains encountering gradients of

1 in 20 and 1 in 10 respectively.

   Barker's Hydraulic, Clarke and Webb's Mechanical, Fay's Mechanical, and

Smith's Vacuum Brake produced retarding forces varying from G-47 to 5-72 per

cent, of the gross weight, forming a group giving an average of 6-04 per cent, of

retarding force, from which amount no deviation greater than 042 per cent, occurred

either way.

The diagram (Plate IV.) illustrates this group of experiments.

Three out of the four brakes last named, viz. Barker's, Clarke and Webb's and

Fay's, gave, when sand was used, an average of 7 - 79 per cent, of retarding force,

and none of them differed from that mean by more than - 15 per cent.

These trials served to show in a very striking manner the great advantage

obtained by the application of  a continuous brake                                                                                         for  even  in the                                                                                                                                                                                   least effective

power was afforded than by  the  usual  system  of  hand-brakes                                                                                       wdiilst                                                                                                                                                                                         in  the  most

effective form the stopping-power was quadrupled, enabling, in the latter case, a

train travelling at 60 miles an hour to be pulled up on an emergency within a

space of 400 yards instead of the mile required in the case of hand-brakes to

tender and vans.

   The highest amount of retarding force obtained in any of our trials had been
10t>4 per cent, of the entire weight of the train, a force which stopped a train,
weighing 208 tons, from 51 miles an hour in the space of 275 vards.

   In this instance the continuous breaks were applied to seventy wheels out of the
seventy-two wheels on which the train ran; and 94-4 per cent, of the total weight
was supported by those seventy braked wheels.

This performance is above the average of the several systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but I  am  of   opi-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

nion that no system of continuous brakes should be regarded as satisfactory or

otherwise than provisional which should not afford a retarding power equal to at

least 8 to 10 per cent, of the entire weight of a train ; in other words, a power by

which the stoppage of fast trains can be effected in from one third to one fourth

the distance required under the ordinary brake appliances.

   It may be believed that the range between 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, of re-

tarding force, as afforded by the brakes used in our experiments, involving a cor-

responding range of difference in the stopping distance, will be greatly reduced

now that much experience in their working has been gained.

   Indeed it is satisfactory to note that already better results have been attained,

especially in the case of the Smith's Vacuum Brake and the Westinghouse Auto-

matic.

   I find in No. 801 of ' Engineering,' July 6, 1877, the record of a series of twelve
trials on the North-Eastern Railway of each of these two systems of brakes, said
to have been conducted with great care, giving as the average result of each set of
trials no less than

   8| per cent, of gross load in the case of Smith's Vacuum, and
   12g per cent, in the case of the Westinghouse Automatic, as the respective re-
tarding forces developed where the gross weight of train was 170 tons, and the
initial speeds ranged lrorn 44 to 64 miles per hour.

It is obvious that the stopping distance is influenced by two primary condi-

tions :
--196 report 1877.

   First, by the length of the interval of time which occurs between the moment
of performing the operation which has the effect of putting the brake into action,
and the moment wheu the brake-blocks begin to place an effective grip upon the

wheels, and

Secondly, by the amount of pressure brought to bear on each wheel, and by the

constancy or otherwise of the action after the blocks have come to grip the wheels.

It would not appear to be a difficult task to arrange the proportions of the parts

of the mechanism of any brake in such wise as to ensure that an assigned and

definite  pressure  shall  be  brought  to bear on each block                                                                                                    and it is doubtless from
                                                                                                                                                              ;

the want of such suitable adjustment that the pressure in some of the examples of

continuous brakes is found to be too feeble for accomplishing a rapid stop.

The reduction of the interval of time elapsing before the pressure is fairly put

on may not so easily be effected, being in a measure incidental, more or less, to each

specific form of brake.

   That much room for improvement remained in the way of effecting an equal
and constant pressure on the wheels throughout the period of the brake-action was

evident from the results brought out by au analysis of the time-records.
   These have been translated into the form of the submitted diagram (Plato IV.),

from which it will be observed that the retarding force, in its earlier stage, instead of
being uniform and constant, is broken up into a series of impulses more or less violent,

but becoming more uniform towards the close of the period of its action, a condi-
tion due probably to the increasing number of the wheels which had become skidded.

   The diagram serves to illustrate this effect. It has been prepared from the

electrically recorded time-observations.

   The ordinates represent by scale the mean speeds at successive intervals of space

traversed.

   The curved lines connecting the extremities of the ordinates thus show approxi-

mately the variations of the retarding force.
   It is this intermittent fitful action which produces undue strains on the drawbars

and chains, and the unpleasant sensation frequently experienced during quick stops.
   It would seem that after the brakes are first brought to bite the wheels, their

hold becomes relaxed, a slip takes place, followed by successive bites and slips, the

latter giving rise to sudden accelerations of speed.
   The action of a perfect brake should exactly resemble that which gravity would

cause if an ascending incline of uniform gradient could be suddenly presented in

front of the train to stop its motion.

   Under such conditions no inconvenience or danger is to be apprehended from

accomplishing the stop in even shorter distances than any effected during the course

of our experiments.

   Practically no inconvenience was experienced in stopping one of the best
appointed trains, 200 tons in weight, running at over 50 miles an hour, in a period

of 18 seconds ; and generally the stops were effected without unpleasant sensation,
though in some instances the recoil of the buffers at the final moment of stoppage

gave rise to a sensible and disagreeable jerk.

   It became obvious, during the course of our experiments, that a valuable addition
of brake-power, under the immediate control of the driver, was afforded by the
fitting of breaks to the engines ; and it is satisfactory to find that the recommenda-
tion of the Royal Commissioners in this respect has met with the prompt attention

of Railway Companies.
   "We learn from the Board of Trade return already referred to, that about 250

engines have been so fitted, about 100 engines with the Westinghouse, 100 with
Smith's Vacuum, 30 with Stroudley's Steam Brake, and the rest with the brakes of

Saunders, Barker, and the Steel-McIrmes, showing how fully the importance of

utilizing the heavy weight of the engine is becoming appreciated, and affording

proof at the same time that the apprehensions of injury to the engines entertained

by some of the locomotive superintendents are virtually without foundation.

    It is believed that far less objection attaches to the application of brakes to thi$

engine-wheels than to the act of reversing by back steam, whilst such reversing waij
proved by our experiments to be less effective than brakes.
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       197

The measure of brake-power developed in the engine may be illustrated by the

following' experiments which we made :

  A North-Eastern Company's engine, 40 tons weight, with tender 27 tons

(altogether 67 tons), and travelling at 59 miles an hour, was brought up by
.Smith's Vacuum Brake applied to the engine only in 617 yards, giving a retarding
force of 4"22 tons or 10'50 per cent, of the weight of the engine, an important

factor when it is considered how large a portion of the gross weight of a train is

represented by its engine.

On several of the continental lines, on a few of our railways here, and notably

on the Highland railway, the Chatelier or Counterpressure Brake has been applied

to the engines with considerable advantage, and this may in cases of emergency

prove a valuable auxiliary to the engine-brake.

   The Locomotive Superintendent of the Highland Railway Company has favoured

me with some details of its working on that line, where it has been applied to 60

out of their 67 engines. " Generally speaking, it is not used on that line every dajr
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,

and never in stopping at stations if approached at the ordinary speed ; nor by the

majority of drivers is it used to control the trains down the banks in ordinary
working, but each driver can refer to cases in which it was of great use, especially
by the service it has rendered going down banks in snow, when the ordinary brakes

had lost their effectiveness."

  When the reversing lever is pulled back to cut off at 40 per cent., the retarding

force produced by back-pressure steam appears to be just sufficient to prevent

acceleration in the speed of a train of 180 tons weight, inclusive of engine and

tender, on a descending gradient of 1 in 70.

The question of the best material for brake-blocks has of late received a good

deal of consideration, and it would seem that cast-iron and even steel blocks are fast
superseding wood. The majority of the trains sent to Lincoln for the trials were

litted with cast-iron blocks, the only important exception being the Lancashire and

Yorkshire Company's train (Fay's Brake), which was furnished exclusively with

wooden blocks.

  We were unable to discover any clear indication of the one being superior to the

other in skidding power ; but doubtless the wear of iron blocks is much less rapid.

  We had occasion to observe that with none of the Continuous Brakes used did

the wheels become skidded until a very considerable reduction in the speed of

the train had taken place.

  When the rails are in a damp and greasy state it is likely that cast iron or

steel blocks displace sooner than wooden blocks the film of slimy matter which

forms on the tyres of the wheels, a film which may become impressed and

embedded into the soft substance of the wood, preventing, until removed by

prolonged pressure, a full and powerful bite on to the wheels.

It is to be remarked that the utmost brake-power obtained scarcely exceeded

10 per cent, of the weight of the braked vehicles ; whereas, from the experiments
of Morin, Rennie, and others, it has been shown that the coefficient of friction

of iron sliding upon iron, the surfaces being clean, is from l-5th to l-6th, say 16

to 20 per cent, of the insistent pressure.
   The discrepancy is to be accounted for by the circumstance that dm-ing the

larger portion of the space traversed in effecting the stop, only few of the wheels

become skidded, and for the remaining portion not all the wheels come into that

condition.

Nor does    it seem desirable that such should be  the  case                    for without doubt the
                                                                             ;

wear and tear of wheel-tyres and of rails is sensibly increased by skidding.

For ordinary stops, therefore, the brake-pressure should be adjusted to act just

short of skidding the wheels, whilst the full skidding power should only be applied
in cases of imminent danger.

  A difference of opinion exists on the question of the relative effects of skidded

and unskidded wheels in effecting the stop ; but this we considered was set at rest
by two experiments with a train of six of the Midland Railway Company's four-

wheeled vans coupled together and formed into a single train, each van having its

own guard to apply the brake-power by hand. All the wheels of this train had

brakes.
                                                                                             ----

--198 report 1877.

   The speed being- about 40 miles an hour in each case, stops were effected with

the following results :

   1st. With force applied to brakes just short of skidding, stopped in 226 yards;

retarding force 7'74 per cent.

   2nd. With all the force that could be applied, stopped in 192 yards ; retarding

force 9-28 per cent.

   Tims it was found that the skidding had added about 20 per cent, to the force
produced by the same brakes when they did not skid the wheels.

It is clear that the ultimate resisting force is derived from the rails ; consequently

the effect under the differing circumstances of skidding or not skidding is propor-

tional to the difference of the space traversed by the train and that described (on

the average) by the tyres of the several wheels. If the wheels could be taken as

being all of them skidded throughout the entire period of the stoppage, that

difference would be represented by the space traversed, and then the retarding

force would be  a  maximum                                                                   whereas if  the  wheels  continue  to revolve at a rate
                                                                            ;

below that due to the speed of the train, the " slip " will represent so much

retarding power lost.

The superiority of Continuous Brakes over brakes of the ordinary kind appears

to be practically admitted by all railway companies, seeing that a good Continuous

Brake willreduce the stopping distances of fast trains to one third of the distance

within which they can be stopped by ordinary means.

The general adoption of some one effective system of Continuous Brakes on

carriages which have to run from one line to another would certainly be productive

of much advantage                                                                            for even in breaking up and remaking a train  at any junction-
                                                                                          ;

station they would be found fitted with the appliances requisite for* working

together, and for availing of the common source of power which may be afforded

by the engine or by the vans. Otherwise the speciallv fitted trains must be

arranged to run through from end to end of the line, or "passengers to whom ia

accorded the security afforded by the continuous brakes, must change from one

train to another when entering a line of railway on which some other system of

brake is employed.

   If the allied companies could agree to adopt the same system there is little
doubt but that the conversion of ordinary into continuous brakes would proceed
with far greater rapidity than would be the case on the other assumption, and that

the public would at a much earlier period be found to enjoy the full benefit of the

change. Nevertheless, and until sufficient time has been allowed for testing under

all circumstances the merits of the different systems now on trial, it may be scarcely
reasonable to expect the present adhesion of any considerable number of railway

companies to one particular system.

   The time, however, has arrived not only when each system should be
scrutinized and tested in the most complete manner, but when the companies should

clearly set before themselves the conditions which a good continuous brake should

satisfy.

  A study of the different systems of brakes which came under our notice, and their

behaviour under the different circumstances of their application, seems to point to
the following as the conditions which a perfect continuous brake for heavy fast
trains should be called upon to satisfy :

   1st. The brake-power should be applied to all the wheels of all the vehicles
throughout the train.

   2nd. The power by which the blocks are forced upon the wheels should
be adequate to skidding the wheels upon the speed becoming moderately

reduced.

   3rd. The Driver should have the whole of the brake-power of the train completely
under his command, and be able to apply it at a moment's notice, as he is the

first person likely to discover any obstruction ahead, and is primarily responsible

lor the regard of danger signals. lie can thus stop the train at once,' and no time
is lost by his having to signal danger to the Guard.

   4th. The Guards should individually possess the like means of applying the
continuous brake, that they may be enabled to stop the train without referenc
to the Driver on an emergency which may have manifested itself to the Guard, but
                                                                            '

                                                                                                             <

of which the Driver is unaware, such, for instance, as a broken axle, or a carriage

getting oif the line.

   6th. The power in hand should be susceptible of easy modulation that the Driver
may be able to apply a moderate amount only for effecting ordinary stops, whilst
he keeps in reserve a proper excess of power to be used only on emergencies, or on

the contingency of slippery rails.
   Gth. Full break-application should not require more than a very moderate effort

OH the part of Driver or Guard.

   7th. The pressure should be steady and distributed as equally as possible over all
the wheels, and acting upon them with the intervention of some elastic medium to
prevent too suddeu and violent action, which might occasion the snapping of

chains or drawbars, and tend to inconvenience the passengers.
    8th. The machinery should be of simple construction, not likely soon to get out

of order, and admitting of being easily repaired.
    9th. Indication should be constantly afforded to Driver and Guards that the brakes

are in a proper condition to work or otherwise.
    10th. The power of working the tender brake and the van brakes by hand, as

well as by power, may be advantageously retained.
   11th. The brakes to be self-acting in case of severance of the train, and when

Severed the Guards to have control over the severed portions.
    12th. Automatic action being provided, means should be furnished to the brake-

attendants for modifying that action instantaneously, according to the circumstances

in which the trains may be placed after an accident has occurred.

    13th. It would be dangerous, and therefore unadvisable, to give to passengers any

power over the brakes.
    Such seem to be the principal conditions necessary for realizing the conception

of a perfect brake ; and these, when carried into practice, and combined with the
power of applying at will a force which, inclusive of the friction of the train,
should amount" to 10 per cent, of its weight, would constitute an invaluable instru-
ment in the hands of our train-attendants for use under contingencies of almost
daily occurrence at some place or another of the great network of railways which

 covers this country.

                                On the Upward Jets of Niagara.

                     By W. H. Barlow, V.P. Inst. C.E., F.B.S.
   When visiting Niagara last year, after acting as one of the Judges at the

 Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, 1 observed certain physical effects connected

 with the Great Falls to which I desire to draw attention.
    First. It was observable that the doors and windows of our hotel, unless tightly

 closed, were subjected to a jarring movement, the impulses of which varied in time
 and degree.
- The hotel in question is "Clifton House," on the Canada side, the southern face
 being parallel to and nearly opposite the American Falls, from which it is distant
 about a quarter of a mile ; and its south-west corner is not far from being opposite
 to the mean line of face of the Canada or Horseshoe Falls, the distance Deing
 over half a mile.

    The windows of the hotel opened on hinges, and if tine of them was set slightly
 open, and the observer placed himself in such a position as to see the reflexions of
 distant objects in the surface of the glass, the times and varying intensity of the

 jarring impulses could be clearly observed.
200 .                             report-- 1877.

Secondly. On looking at the Falls themselves, and especially at the Horseshoe

Fall, there appeared from time to time, through the mist which always envelopes

the lower part of the Falls, jets of water projected suddenly upwards. These jets

frequently rose much ahove the level of the upper part of the Fall. Judging from the

known height of the Falls, they frequently rose front 10 to HO feet ahove the upper

level. They occurred at varying intervals ; but very few minutes elapsed without

seeing one of greater or less magnitude.

   It was also observable that they had a characteristic form, somewhat resembling

--a pine-tree that is to say, small or pointed at the top, and widening out

downwards.

They were not formed of a compact mass of water, but had that appearance,

which is seen in large fountains, of being composed of lumps of water of various

sizes, decreasing in the lower part, until they were lost in the general mist which

surrounded the lower part ot the Falls.

The continual recurrence of these jets, and the continual recurrence of the jarring

action above referred to, point to the conclusion that both effects are due to one

cause                             and my object in drawing attention to the subject is to endeavour to suggest
                               ;

the nature of the cause which is producing these effects.

Proceeding to a nearer view of the waters by going beneath the Falls, and looking

at and through them, it becomes apparent that the water which flows over the

upper rocks in a continuous curved stream breaks up into masses of greater or less

magnitude during its descent, so that air in large quantities gets in and between

the falling masses of water.

In this intermixing of air and water it may frequently happen that a quantity

of air is surrounded^and enclosed in a heavy mass of water ; and falling in this state

with a velocity due to the height of 150 or 1G0 feet, the contained air would become

suddenly and violently compressed on striking the rocks below.

The energy of the charge of compressed air thus suddenly generated would burst

through the thinnest layer of its surrounding water, and so constitute a species of

explosion carrying a portion of the water with it.

Assuming the weight of the water which generated the compression to be greater

than that on which the energy of the compressed air operated, the effect would be

to project the smaller mass of water with a greater velocity than that due to the

original force.

The supposition most consistent with the observed phenomena appears, therefore,

to he that the two effects, namely, the jets of water, and the jarring action shown

on the doors .and windows, are both due to the explosions or sudden expansions of

air compressed b}r the falling water as above described.

There are several circumstances which appear to favour this supposition :

   First. The sudden upward blasts of air accompanied by water, felt by persons
when beneath the Falls, which are probably only minor effects of a like action.

   Secondly. The jarring motion imparted to the doors and windows appears to

have no corresponding effect in the solid ground ; from which it may be inferred

that the effect is due to concussions conveyed through the air, and not "to the tremor

of the earth by the weight of the falling water.

   Thirdly. The characteristic form of the jets, which is similar to that produced by
explosions under water, when the conditions are such as to throw the water to a

considerable height.

Lastly. The suddenness and energy of the operating force, as shown by the jets

being frequently projected considerably above the level of the upper water.

   The inquiry is one of some interest, and may serve to throw light upon those

anomalous effects which have been observed from time with regard to heavy seas

falling on a rocky shore, and the extreme height to which the water is occasionally

projected under those conditions.

  Two notable instances of this kind have been given by the engineers of the

English and Scotch Lighthouses.

One at the Bishop Lighthouse, where a fog-bell weighing three hundredweight,

and fixed at a height of 100 feet above the sea, was displaced and thrown down to

the rocks below.
                                                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.             201

    The other occurred at the North-Unst Lighthouse, -which is built on a rock,
whose height is 190 feet ahove high water, and presenting an almost perpendicular
face to the sea. In this case, during a heavy north-west gale, a quantity of
water was projected upwards sufficient to overthrow the boundary walls and force
open the door of the house.

   With regard to the form of jet produced by a subaqueous explosion near the

surface, I had the opportunity, a short time since, of witnessing an experiment
made by Professor Abel at the Eoyal Arsenal at Woolwich.

   The explosive used was compressed gun-cotton. The jet on this occasion rose to
a great height, reminding one of the great Crystal-Palace fountain, and it was
remarkable from the complete vertically of its centre line of force, and from the
resemblance in its pine-tree form to the jets of Niagara.

Lode Mining in the West of England. By J. H. Collins, F.G.S.

   The author restricted his remarks to the mining of lodes properly so called,

Without referring to the general geology of the district or to the mineral deposits

other than lodes. He also left untouched the questions of drainage, ventilation,
and ore-drainage. He defined a lode as a mineral deposit occupying a fissure in the

ground or the rocks on either side in its immediate neighbourhood, and containing

metallic minerals in greater or less proportion, and the rich parts as being those

parts of a lode which are sufficiently rich to pay for working.
He stated that the same lode might be, and often was, worked at the same time

by several companies, and that it might yield ores of different kinds, as tin and

copper, either mingled together or at different depths; that the "bearing" of best

tin- and copper-lodes was approximately east and west (magnetic), the average

inclination or underlie 70°, the variations in width from a mere line to 20 or 30

feet, the average width less than 4 feet, and the average produce, even of the rich

parts, taken as a whole, was less than 4 per cent, for copper-ores, and less than 2

per cent, for tin-ores                                                                     that copper-lodes in groimd of moderate hardness were
                                                                                        ;

generally richer than those in very hard or very soft ground; that the more

vertical parts of lodes were generally richer than the less vertical, the wider richer

than the narrower, the lodes dipping towards granite richer than those dipping

away from it                                                      but that there were many exceptions to all these generalizations.
                                                               ;

He then compared a lode to a steep or rearing seam of coal, and stated that it

was in general subject to all the irregularities of such a seam with other irregularities

superadded.

   He then described in detail the modes of discovering lodes and laying out lode-

workings, and the mode of sinking shafts, driving levels, &c, with the cost, under

ordinary and extraordinary conditions, and the comparative advantages of downright
or vertical and inclined shafts.

   He then described the methods of timbering shafts and levels &c, and the

different classes of workmen employed in the mines, with the nature of the

different contracts under which they worked, with their advantages and disad-
vantages, also the arrangements for supervision.

On the Works now in course of execution for improving the Navigation of one
    of the mouths of the Mississippiy under the. direction of Mr. James Eads, C.E.

   By Captain Douglas Galton, C.B.^D.C.L., F.R.S.

  New Orleans is situated about 120 miles above the mouth of the Mississippi.

The town lies in a semicircular area formed by a bend in the river, which at that
part is above a mile in width and of sufficient depth to accommodate the largest
vessels, as well as to allow them to lie alongside of the wharves which occupy the
circumference of the semicircle. The river flows undiminished in width and

breadth for about 10S miles below New Orleans, when it separates into three prin-

cipal passes, which in their turn divide into many subsidiary channels, forming the
delta by means of which its waters reach the Gulf of Mexico.

   The point where the stream separates is called the Head of the Passes, and the

three principal channels are termed the Pass k Loutre, the South Pass, and the
South-west Pass respectively.

   The Pass a Loutre separates into five branches of various sizes.
   The South Pass gives access at about midway in its length to another channel
called the Grand Bayon.
   The South-west Pass runs in a continuous stream for 1 7 miles, but divides into

separate channels at its lower end.

   At the commencement of Mr. Eads's works, about 58 per cent, of the water of the

Mississippi passed through the South-west Pass, 12 per cent, through the South
Pass, and the remainder through the Pass a Loutre.

  A shoal-bar exists at the mouth of each of these three Passes; the depth of water

on each bar varies generally in proportion to the volume carried to the Gulf over
it. This bar is composed entirely of sedimentary matter brought down by the river.
The water issuing from the passes, no longer confined by banks, spreads out on
either side. The velocity diminishes, the sediment drops, the bar forms. The
central thread of the current being the strongest, and the water being the deepest

there, the velocity is preserved and the sediment carried out much further than in
the shoal water over the submerged new banks of the pass. The outer crest of the

bar is thus thrown out 2 J miles from the end of the land at the South Pass, and 5
miles at the South-west Pass. The depth on the bar at the former pass was 7£
feet at mean low tide, when Mr. Eads's works were commenced.

   The depth on the bar at the South-west Pass was about 15 feet ; but it has been
increased recently by continued dredging, under the auspices of the United-States
Government, to a depth of from 16 to 17 feet.

   The depth of the bar of the Pass a Loutre was somewhere between the two. The
rise and fall of the tide at the mouth of the Mississippi does not exceed from one
and a half to two feet.

   In former years the trade of New Orleans was a large and increasing one ; but

the gradual introduction into commerce of a class of vessels too large to cross the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  203

bars at the mouths of the passes has for some time past tended to divert trade, and

the grain-trade especially, to the Atlantic seaports.

   Moreover, the war of secession interposed a sudden check to commercial inter-

course between the North-western States of the Union and New Orleans. When,

however, the trade between the Northern and Southern States began to revive, after
the wars of secession, the merchants of St. Louis urged upon the United-States

Government the necessity of improving the access from the sea to New Orleans.

   The United-States Corps of Engineers, in 1873-4, were consequently called to
advise ; and they submitted a project for a ship-canal, which was to be protected by
lock-gates, and was to be constructed from Fort St. Philip, a point in the Mississippi
some 18 miles above the passes, in an easterly direction, into water of about 30 feet
depth, in Isle-of-Breton Sound, whence the ships would pass out into the Gulf of

Mexico.

   The canal was to be entered by a lock. It would have required about 10 years
for completion ; its cost was estimated at $10,000,000, and it would only, when
completed, have been able to accommodate a limited trade.

   Mr. Eads at the same time proposed a rival scheme for improving one of the
passes, by increasing and controlling the flow of water through it.

  He proposed to improve the South-west Pass, which aflbrded the best prospect

of success. The United-States Government refused this, but allowed Mr. Eads to
experiment on the South Pass, provided he undertook the work at his own risk.

   In addition to the bar at the mouth of the South Pass, there was also a shoal of
about 12 feet deep at the head of the pass. Mr. Eads's confidence, and that of his
friends, in his scheme enabled him to accept the Government offer. The following

are the terms on which he has undertaken the work:--
   When a depth of 20 feet for a width of 200 feet has been obtained through the

channel, he was to receive a sum of $500,000; for each succeeding depth of two feet
down to a depth of 30 feet he is to receive a further sum of $-500,000, with several

--further sums of $250,000, each contingent upon the several depths being maintained

for 12 months each respectively making the total payment $4,500,000, when a
depth of 30 feet has been maintained for 12 months. He is to receive two further
payments of $500,000 each when the work has been effective for 10 years and 20
years, in addition to $100,000 a year for maintaining the work during 20 years.

   The work was commenced on the 15th of June 1875.
   The object of the works is to concentrate an increased flow of water in the South

Pass as well as across the shoal-bars at each end--first, by means of lines of jetties,

funnel-shaped at the head of the pass and parallel at its lower end ; secondly, by
closing the Grand Bayon, which diverted a portion of the water after it had entered
the South Pass and prevented its reaching its lower end ; and thirdly, by regulating
the proportion of water to be admitted into the Pass a Loutre and the South-west

Pass.

   The jetties and all works in the water are constructed in a simple and compara-
tively inexpensive manner. Stone is not found on the lower Mississippi ; that which
has been used came either in ships as ballast, or has been brought down the Missis-

sippi from the Ohio river : if stone alone had been used, the light mud of which

the bottom is formed woxdd have swallowed up an enormous quantity, and a very
long time woidd have been occupied in the formation of the jetties.

  --The construction which has been adopted is as follows : Piles are driven in the

line of the proposed jetties at about 10 feet apart : against these piles mattresses of

willow-branches about 2 feet thick are sunk. These mattresses vary in size from 75

feet in length and 40 feet wide to smaller widths and shorter lengths as may
be desired. To make the mattress, strips of pine- wood about 3 inches by 2 inches

are laid parallel to each other on inclined ways on the river-bank; they are kept in
position by cross strips nailed to them at intervals : into these longitudinal strips
pegs of hickory, two feet long, are fixed at six-feet intervals, the top of the peg being
turned so as to correspond with a hole in a second strip of pine-wood to be eventually

put on ; after the pegs of hickory have been fixed into the longitudinal strips first
mentioned, a layer of willow-branches is laid across and trodden down, then a second
layer lengthways, and so on alternately until the thickness of two feet is attained,

when the whole is kept in place by the second mentioned strip of pine-wood being
                                                                                                   16*
--204 report 1877.

fixed on to the tops of the hickory pegs ; and thus sufficient solidity is obtained to

permit of the mattresses being handled.
   These mattresses, 75 feet long and 40 feet wide, are sunk in horizontal layers, with

one edge resting against the piles on the side towards the channel. To sink them

they are loaded with just sufficient stone to carry them down.
   It is stated that the sediment deposited by the water would of itself suffice to

sink them after its exposure in the water for a week. On these wider mattresses

narrower ones are then placed, with one edge close against the piles, and so on in

succession they thus form a series of steps, till the surface of the water is reached,
                                                 ;

when a pile is driven close against the outer edge of the top mattress through the
under layers to hold them all in place. The top mattress is then covered with stone
to about two feet above the surface ; and when the top sinks down, as it does

gradually and unevenly, it is again raised by stone or by mattresses and stone.
   It is intended eventually to cover the whole with stone ; the sloping sides will be

covered with large rough stones thrown in, and the top surface with stones laid

with more regidarity.
   This is the method of constructing the more permanent jetties ; where more

temporary effects are desired to be obtained, as for the purpose of directing the flow

of the current during the construction of the permanent work, the mattresses are

applied sometimes vertically, sometimes at a steep incline.

The peculiarity of this mode of construction in the Mississippi is, that at first the

jetty is very pervious to water ; consequently a portion of the water which comes
down the Pass flows through the interstices of the wickerwork in its progress

through the jetties, and thus the scouring effect of the water is gradually lost.

   But the water is so full of silt that by degrees the interstices become filled up,
and the jetty wall is thus gradually made impervious to water : in proportion as the
work is thus strengthened, the scouring power of the water on the channel will

increase.

The operation of the current in the channel is therefore necessarily gradual, and

its effect increases with the consolidation of the banks.

   At the mouth of the Pass, the east jetty is 12,100 feet in length ; and the west

jetty, in consequence of the greater prolongation of the west bank of the Pass, is

about 7,660 feet in length.

   At the head of the Passes there is an island about mid-channel ; this has been

connected with the east side of the channel, so as to confine the water in one channel

and from this island, and from a point on the western shore, jetties have been
carried up the stream across the shoal at the head of the Pass for a length of about

2,500 feet.

   At the Grand Bayon the area of a section of the channel, at high water, contained

about 24,000 square feet, whereas at the southern extremity of the Pass a corre-
sponding section had an area of section of about 14,000, the diminished section

being due to the diminished volume of water consequent upon a portion being ab-
stracted by the Grand Bayon.

  A dam has been erected across the Grand Bayon, as well as one across a small

bayon lower down the Pass, so that the whole of the water which enters the
head of the Pass now flows through the jetties at the mouth into the Gulf of

Mexico.

   Since the closing of the Grand Bayon, the advance in width and depth of the

channel below that point has been steady and regular ; and the increased volume of
water issuing from the mouth of the Pass is gradually producing its effect, by
tending to make the section of the lower part of the Pass equivalent to the normal

section above.

The third object to be attained by the works, viz. to control the flow of water

through the South-west Pass and the Pass a Loutre, is in progress, but not yet
Acomplete.
                sill has been placed across the head of the South-west Pass to prevent

scour. It consists of an apron of mattresses. It runs from a point on the west

line of piles were driven and mattresses were sunk against the upperside. These

mattresses are 70 feet wide, and are sunk side by side so as to make the apron 70 feet
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         205

wide and 2 feet high. After the mattresses were sunk, the piles were pulled up to

give a passage-way to vessels.

The soft nature of the bottom is shown by the fact that in places where the water

was 30 feet deep, it was necessary to use piles 70 feet long, to make them stand.

WhenThe idea is that this sill will prevent scour in these channels.  I visited

the works last spring this apron had stood the test of one flood, and no movement

of the mattresses had occurred.

  A similar apron is in course of being laid across the head of the Pass a Loutre.

The results of the whole works so far are, that a deep-Avater contour-line, of from

about 22 feet to 23 feet, has been earned through the shoal at the head of the

Pass ; at the lower end on the outer bar the depth, which in June 1875 was 9 feet

2 inches, had increased in March of this year to 20 feet 10 inches.

The general result of the works to the last date at which I have obtained reports

is shown in the following table, which gives the depth of water that could be carried

through each 2000 feet below East-Point station at different dates :

      Interception of Rainfall from Sewers. Bu Baldwin Latham, G.E.,

                               M.Inst. C.E., F.G.S., F.MS., $c.

   The author observed that the admission of large and uncertain volumes of_ rain-
fall into sewers at uncertain periods was attended with considerable difficulties in
many districts in which purification of the sewage had to be effected. In the
majority of towns the rainfall was admitted into the sewers, the excess of rainfall
and sewage being discharged by storm- water overflows, to the great detriment of
the streams which received the discharge from such overflows. The complete

separation of rainfall from sewers had been advocated ; but considerable difficulties
arose from such separation in crowded towns, as in times of rainfall the water
flowing from the streets to the sewers was found to be quite as impure as the

sewage proper. Moreover, the admittance of rainfall into the sewers necessitated
an increase of capacity in the sewers--as, for example, London, where two thirds of
the total capacity of the sewers was required for carrying away the moderate
quantity of a quarter of an inch of rainfall in twenty-four hours. The author had
carried out a complete system of sewerage in the Borough of Longton and in the conti-
guous district of the East Vale Local Board, the combined districts containing a popu-
lation of about 25,000. The sewage was taken under an arrangement with His Grace

the Duke of Sutherland, the adjoining landed proprietor, and used for irrigating land.

A duplicate system of sewers had been carried out, a connexion being made

between the rainfall-sewers and the sewers proper, and what was termed an "inter-
ceptor" was provided at the point of junction between the two systems of sewers.
The interceptors consisted of a leaping weir so arranged that when there was a
small quantity of water flowing down the rainfall-sewers, and the liquid as a
natural consequeneo was very polluted, it passed through an adjustable opening
into the sewer proper ; but in time of rainfall, when the volume and velocity of the
stream in the rainfall-sewers was increased and the water was comparatively pure, it
leaped over the opening into the sewer and passed to the natural streams of the
district. The cost of such interceptors was about £31 each, twenty-two of them
being used in the district of Longton and East Vale, and their employment gave

the most perfect satisfaction to the authorities.

 Indications of the Movement of Subterranean Water in the Chalk Formation.

          By Baldwin Latham, C.E., M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S., F.M.S., #c

                                                           [Plate V.]

    It is a matter of considerable importance to the engineer that he should be able
to determine with accuracy the direction of the flow of underground water, as both
the volume and quality of the water to be procured at a particular spot in well-
sinking depend upon knowing the extent of the contributing area and the direction

of the flow of the water.

  A very large number of observations have been made by different persons on the

relative height at which the water stands in wells in the Chalk formation. The
Rev. James Clutterbuck, Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., Mr-. J. Lucas, F.G.S., the author,
and others have shown by direct measurement that the water in the chalk and
other geological formations does not stand at what is termed a " water-level ;" and
what is known as the " water-level " of subterranean water is usually a line having
a considerable declivity. The very fact of water standing at such a declivity is
clear evidence of movement ; and the observed declivity is called the angle-friction,
or the measurement of the resistance of the water in moving through the strata,
just the same as the fall in the surface of an open stream is the measurement of
the resistance the water meets with in its passage down the channel of the stream.
' It was pointed out by Professor Prestwich, some years ago, that subterranean
water is governed in its movement by the same laws as regulate surface-streams.
The more the question of movement of subterranean water is Investigated this is
found to be the case. The greatest elevation of the subterranean water is usually
found under the highest lands, and the least elevation under the lands having the
lowest level. The flow of water laterally is from the hills to the valleys, and
208 report-- 1877.

longitudinally down the valley-lines ; therefore, as a general ride, the flow of sub-

terranean water conforms to the surface-falls of the country. There are, however,

exceptions to this rule, as the author has found in several instances.

  An examination of a district having a number of contributing valleys shows very

clearly that tbe subterranean water moves down the subsidiary valleys into the

main valley ; and the confluence of the streams produces identically the same effect

in the underground channels as is observed by the junction of two streams or the
water flowing in two pipes. The increase of the volume of water brought into a
main subterranean channel from a subsidiary valley elevates the surface of the water

at the point of junction. This is clearly indicated by the longitudinal sections of

a main valley joined by contributory valleys at various points. Taking any one of

these examples, it is found that if a line is drawn from the surface of the water

at a point above where a junction is known to take place with the surface of the

water at another point below where the junction is effected, the result shows that

at every period of the year, and whether the water is rising or falling, there is

a considerable convexity in the longitudinal section of the water at the point at
Awhich water is received.
                                           number of examples of this character are shown in

making careful sections of the chalk valleys south of Croydon, particularly in a

valley about eight miles long, extending from Caterham to the river Wandle at

Croydon. Not unfrequently we find one valley runs across another, and such con-
tinuity of the surface may be observed which might lead to the supposition that

the flow of subterranean water is continuous down the valleys. This, however, is

not always the case, as is clearly shown by a section made above Croydon, in the

neighbourhood of Smitham Bottom, in the valley-line between Merstham and

Croydon. It might be supposed that the water flows from Merstham to Croydon

but this is not so, for the cross valley at Smitham Bottom intercepts the water and

conveys it away in another direction. This abstraction of the water is clearly

Aindicated by the depression in the water-line at the point where the water leaves.
    line drawn from a point in the water-line above the point of abstraction to a

point in the water-line below this point shows, during all periods, a concavity in the

water-surface at the point of abstraction. Where such a depression is observed it

is evidence of the abstraction of water. Just the same is observed by purnpin«-
froma well ; the water is generally lowered all round the point of abstraction. The

amplitude of the depression is greatest near the point of abstraction, and diminishes

as we leave that point. It thus becomes quite feasible to determine, by careful

survey, the exact direction in which subterranean water is flowing in such a dis-

trict as that which has recently been under the examination of the author, and also

to pretty accurately determine both the extent of the contributing area and the

probable quantity of water such an area will yield.

  A point of interest in reference to the rise of the water in the Chalk is that, takino-

a long valley, as, for example, the Caterham valley, observation clearly shows that
the water begins to rise in the wells located at the top of the valley before it rises in

the wells situated in the lower part of the same valley ; in fact the water in the
upper wells began to rise while the water in some of the" lower wells was still falling.

 --Here, again, there is a parallelism of what is observed with regard to surface-

streams that the floods descend from the higher to the lower parts of the countrv.

_ It appears singular that the wells in the upper part of the basin should be^in to

rise first                                 and the only solution that the author  can offer  for  this  circumstance  is
                                        ;

that the rainfall is greater upon the higher lands than in the lower parts of the

valley; for it is quite clear that on the 25th November 1876 the water in the well
began to rise at Cambrian House, in the upper part of the Caterham valley, but it
was not until after the 3rd December that the water in the wells be°-an to rise in
the lower parts of the valley at Croydon ; and the water in an intermediate well at
the Rose and Crown Inn, Eiddlesdown, did not rise until about the 12th December.

   In this case the water rose both in the upper and lower parts of the same valley

before it rose at an intermediate point. The rise in the upper part of the valley was
probably due to rainfall, and the rise in the lower part was probably due to the effect

of the united contributions of a number of short valleys discharging- into the main

valley.

Another point which is deserving of attention has reference to the temperature

of the water. Well-water is usually much colder and of much move uniform tem-

perature than ordinary surface-water. Its coldness is, in part, no doubt due to the

Fact that the greatest absorption of rain takes place in the winter months, and the

water enters the ground at a cold period and at about the normal temperature of

the air. Very careful observations on the Chalk formation south of Croydon show

that the month of December is the month which appears principally to contribute

to the supply of the springs, and that after a rainfall it takes some time for the

Asprings to rise, depending mostly on the dryness or wetness of the season.                                                small

rainfall in December is almost sure to be followed by low springs in the following

year, or a dry December interferes, to a most marked extent, with the contribution

of water to  the springs                                              for  although experiments  with  percolation-gauges  show
                                                                   ;

that certain quantities of water percolate at all periods of the year, the measure-

ment of wells and gauging the volume of springs show that a large part of the rain

falling never influences the quantity of water in the ground in the slightest degree.

In the year 1876, between the beginning of May and the end of November,

although over twelve inches of rain had fallen at Croydon, the rainfall did not

alFect the quantity of water in the subsoil ; but during the whole of this period hoth

the volume of water flowing from the springs and the height of the water in the

subsoil steadily diminished. During the present year, there has been a gradual

subsidence in the water, both with regard to its altitude and volume, since the

25th April, although between the beginning of April and the end of July upwards

of ten inches of rain had fallen. It is found, upon examination, that the water of

the deep wells in the higher parts of the district, notwithstanding the greater depth

of the wells, has a lower temperature than the water in the wells in the lower

portion of the district that are not so deep. The water of wells which have been

sunk into the Upper Greensand has relatively a lower temperature than the water

of wells sunk in the chalk. At certain periods the temperature of the water at

the surface of the well is somewhat warmer than at the bottom of the well. In

other cases the water at the bottom of the well is equal in temperature, or exceeds

that of the surface. In all probability, in the cases where the surface-temperature

is greater than the bottom-temperature, it is due to the conduction of heat from

the warmer air of the well to the surface of the water; and the heat being trans-

mitted through the water very slowly downwards, tends to keep the water at the

surface at a higher temperature than at the bottom of the well. This is very

clearly shown in the case of the temperature of the well at the Water Works at

Croydon. The upper water in the well on the 6th December 1876 had a

temperature of 64°-5, while at the bottom of the well the temperature was 51°-25.

The increase of the surface-temperature in this case was due to the admittance of

hot water from the surface-condenser into the well. The temperature ohserved at

the bottom of the well was about the ordinary normal temperature. In cases in

which the water is excessively cold at the bottom of the well, it is probably due

to the inferior motion of the water, the strata being dense, and there being less

circulation. In the lower districts, especially where the water rises into the gravel

and has very free movement, the temperature of the water is higher than in the

chalk. The temperature of the water under the town of Croydon, which is built

upon the outflow of the springs into the gravel, is higher than in the wells imme-

diately outside the town. The movement of the water from the higher to the

lower districts woidd, of itself, tend to raise the temperature. The descent of the

water from a high to a low elevation would also tend to compress air and gases

held in the interstices of the water, and thus would tend to increase the specific

heat. Probably to these two circumstances may be attributed the slight increase

in the temperature of the water observed in moving down such valleys as that of

Caterham, which has its discharge into the River Wandle at Croydon, and also in

other valleys in this neighbourhood.

copper-ores, especially as required in that branch of copper-manufacture called the

   These furnaces are now being widely adopted by alkali manufacturers with great

success, the saving in labour having been over 60'per cent., and of coal over 20 per

cent., while the quality of work done is much superior to hand-work.

        On a more extended use of the Ordnance Datum of Great Britain.

                         By J. N. Shoolbred, Mem. Inst. C.E.

   At a time when a committee of the Association presents a Eeport * to endeavour
to dispel certain misconceptions as to the meaning and true position of the Datum-

plane selected as the basis of the levels of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, it

may not be inappropriate to ask the question, whether this Datum cannot be more
fully made use of, so as to become what it ought to be, a truly national basis or

connecting link between all works of a public character throughout the entire
length and breadth of the country ; and also by what means this can most readily

be efFected. It would appear, inter alia, that much would be done if this basis

 of the system of Ordnance Levels were connected:
     1. In towns with all surveys of Municipal and other bodies.
    2. In seaports and harbours with dock-sills, tide-gauges, and marine surveys of

 the port and of the adjoining coast, thus enabling tidal observations in different
 parts of the kingdom to be compared with one another.

    3. With existing local datum-marks.
    4. On Railways and other large public works with their system of levels as

 given in their deposited plans before Parliament, so as to allow of the different
 works, or their several portions, being connected together.

     As, in order to give force to this last recommendation, an addition to the Stand-
 ing Orders of both Houses of Parliament woidd be requisite, memorials to the
 Chairman of Committees of each House from such bodies as the Council of the
  British Association, of the Institution of Civil Engineers, of the Institution of
  Surveyors, of the Society of Arts, of the Geographical and of the Geological
  Societies, and of others having kindred objects, might be productive of the desired

   effect.

     The whole of the foregoing remarks, it need hardly be said, apply with equal
  force to the Datum of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.

     It may also here be noted that the Ordnance Department is itself doing much,
  in the direction indicated by the foregoing remarks, by the issue, now being made,
  of the Parish maps (25 inches to the mile). They supply similar information to
  that contained in the several Tithe-Commutation Parish maps ; and besides they

  are studded with levels of the country tliey represent. Thus they afford ample
  requisites for a good estate-map, and as such they promise to become both valuable
   nnd duly appreciated.

       On the Plymouth Breakwater. By R. C. Townsend, Superintendent.

    The author offered a few remarks on the damage done during the storm of 7th and
 8th January 1807 to the western arm of the Breakwater, the most vulnerable part

--of the whole structure first observing that during a South or S.W. gale, and

 about an hour and a half before or after low-water spring tides, the heaviest seas
 culminate and strike the foot of the south or sea slope with destructive force, very

 much exceeding that on any other portion of the work.
    It would seem that each wave increases in volume from the Draystone Buoy, off

Penlee Point, running in line with the Knap Buoy and Panther Shoal, finally
impinging on the slope of the west arm of the Breakwater, where, especially in the

 winter months, it invariably dislodges from the fore shore rough limestone blocks
varying in weight from 5 to 10 tons, carrying them over the work and depositing
them on the inner slope. But in the case of the storm referred to (1867), not only
were large rough blocks swept over, but the masonry forming the granite band
ftrotecting the foot of the slope was upheaved and carried away for a considerable
 ength, leaving the rough hearting of the work exposed to future assault. The
primary cause of weakness I traced to the subsidence of the foundation below the
granite band, leaving cavities of considerable length and depth open to hydrostatic
influences. The author thinks that had the granite band been seated a few feet
lower in the work, and the stones of greater weight, the damage done, amount-
ing to over £20,000, might not have been so extensive. The experience thus

gained induced him to recommend the Director of Works (now Sir Alexander Clerk,
B.E.) to adopt for this especial arm of the breakwater a repair of a more massive

--character, that is to say, to carry the new buttress from 3 feet below low-water

mark up the slope in a solid mass to a level of about half-tide, the face of this work
being of large dressed granite blocks, with dovetailed joints and sunk beds, banded
horizontally and vertically, dowels and cramps being introduced in the two upper
courses. The new work, thus repaired, stands admirably, and has so far fulfilled all his
anticipations. In addition to the stability given to this arm of the Breakwater, the
vertical face (in steps) forming the new buttress prevents travelling limestone
boulders being lifted and carried over the works ; in fact the accumulation of detained
stone at the base of the new work proves to be a valuable adjunct to the strength
of this arm of the Breakwater.

  As an example of the heavy waves that occasionally strike the work during a S.S .W.

gale, the author mentioned the displacement of two experimental concrete blocks,
weighing 24 tons each, and one limestone block weighing 35 tons, deposited 60
feet from the toe of the Breakwater and spaced about 30 feet apart. La a storm
some eight years ago the two concrete blocks were capsized and in one tide swept
completely over the Breakwater and deposited on an inner slope. The limestone
block was driven home to the granite band and joined fast amidst other stones.

   As an experiment, the author's predecessor, 13 years ago, deposited on the sea-slope

of the Breakwater, not far from the return angle of west arm, a small concrete block

(Portland cement), with a view to test its powers of resistance to oceanic influence.
During this time the concrete cube has been dislodged more than once by travelling
stones in a gale, but the author has again restored it to its original position, halfway

down the slope. As it stands now, it appears but little reduced by abrasion, and
forms an interesting sample of what good concrete will withstand.

   The whole of the Breakwater is now in excellent condition and may not require

heavy repairs for years to come.
