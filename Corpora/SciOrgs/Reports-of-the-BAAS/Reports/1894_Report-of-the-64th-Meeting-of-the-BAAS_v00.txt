                     REPORT OF THE COUXCIL.

     Report of the Council for the Year 1893-94, p?*esa2^?:t to the General
                Committee at Oxford on Wednesday, August 8, 1894.

The Council have received reports from the General Treasurer duriiiir

the past year, and his account from July 1, 1893 to June 30, 1894, wliieh
lias been audited, will be presented to the General Connnittee.

     As the amount of money voted for grants has been subject to con-

siderable fluctuations, and as the expenditure on printing is apt to
increase unless carefully watched, the Council appointed a Committee to
report on the desirability of equalising the grants made for scientific-
purposes in diflerent years, and of making, if possible, still further
reductions in the expenditure on printing.

     The Council received and adopted the following Report from their

Committee.

         (1) That it is not desirable that the Invested Fund<! of the Association be
             increased, and that the floating balance in the bands of the Treasurer

            might be diminished if the bill for printing, which is now due, were paid
             out of Capital. The Committee therefore recommend that a sufficient .sum

               be taken out of Capital to allow this to be done.
         (2) That the Treasurer be requested to continue the practice, which he bc^raii

              at Nottingham, of presenting to the Committee of Recommendations, at
              their second meeting, an estimate of the receipts and expenses of the

                Association for the current financial year.

        (3) That it is not advisable to lay down any definite rules as to the amount to
              be expended in grants, but that as far as circumstances permit the following

              regulations should be adhered to :

                    (a) That 1,000Z. be at present regarded as the normal annual grant in aid

                           of research.

                 ()3) That this sum be annually granted, unless the estimated floating
                      balance in the hands of the Treasurer at the end of the current

                        financial year is less than 500Z. or greater than 1,000/.
                     (7) If the estimated balance falls short of '>QQl , it is desirable that the

                        grant should be reduced. If it exceeds 1,000Z., the excess ma}' lie
                        regarded as available for increasing the grant above 1,000/.
                    (8) In the case of a sudden increase of the floating balance above 1,000/..
                       due to an exceptionally large meeting, it is not desirable that the
                       whole of the surplus should be spent at one meeting.

        (·4) That in view of the large annual expenditure on printing, the Committee

           recommend that the attention of Committees to whom grants of money
            are made be drawn to the importance of economy. Good service would bo

             rendered to the Association if members of Committees would remember
              that they are severally responsible for the reports, and would do their best
 j to make them as short and inexpensive as is consistent with their utility.

     In accordance with the recommendation that tlie printer's bill then
due should be paid out of Capital, the Council authorised the Trustees to
sell an amount of stock sufficient for this purpose.

An invitation to hold the ATinual Meeting of the Association at

Liverpool in 1896 has been received, and will be brought before the

General  Committee    on Monday                                                           communications  in  reference  to  tlie
                                                                                       ;

Meeting of the Association in 1S97 have been received from Toronto.

The Council recommend that the Mayor of Oxford, Sir W. R. Anson,

Warden of All Souls' College, and Pnjfessor Sylvester be elected Vice-

Presidents of the Association.

The Council having been informed that Mr. L. A. Selby-Bigge, one

of the Local Secretaries, was obliged to resign his office, owing to his

having accepted the appointment of Assistant Charity Commissioner,

Mr. D. H. Nagel was nominated Secretary in his place.

    The Council have elected the following Foreign Men of Science

Corresponding Members :

Prof. Christian Bohr, Copenhagen.                                                         Dr. K. Hcrtwig, Munich.
                                                                                          Dr. Hildebrand, Stockholm.
Prof. W. C. Brogger, Christiania.                                                         M. Henri Moissan, Paris.

WProf. Einthoven, Leiden.

Prof. Heger, Brussels.

   --Resolutions referred to the Council for consideration and action if

desirable :

        (1) That the recommendations regarding the times at which the Sections and
              Sectional Committees shall meet, which have been received from tlie
               Sectional Committees, be referred to the Council.

     The Council, having regard to the fact that the enforcement of th«
same hour of meeting for all Sections would be contrary to the expressed
wish of some of the Sections, resolved that the times of meeting of the
Sections and Committees be arranged by the several Organising Com-
mittees, and be communicated to the General Officers at least one month
before the Annual Meeting ; and that the times so fixed be regularly

adhered to throughout the Meeting on every day except Thursday and

Saturday, in respect of which days the hours may be settled, as at present,

by the Sectional Committees. If no such resolution ])e received from an
Organising Committee, the times of meeting will be arranged as follows :

Section at 11 a.m.. Committee at 10 a.m.

(2) That the resolution received from the Committees of Sections C and G,
     proposing a change in the rule relating to the appointment of Committee.?

     for special objects of science, be referred to the Council.

The Council, having considered the question, do not recommend any

change in this rule.

In consequence of the establishment of a separate Section of

Physiology, Animal and Vegetable, it seemed likely that papers on

botanical subjects might be divided between this Section and that of

Biology. The Council received a communicatio]i from a meeting of

Botanists, held last November, pointing out the inconvenience that was

likely to arise from such a division ; and they were asked to appoint a

Committee to confer with a Committee of Botanists, who would represent

the views of the meeting. The Council, after receiving their Committee's

Report, resolved to recommend to the General Committee that, instead
Dof Section
             and Section I as at present constituted, there be three

Sections, namely Section D, Zoology ; Section I, Physiology ; and

Section K, Botany

     The Council also propose that the word 'Mineralogy' be omitted
from the title of Section B, as papers on Mineralogy are read not oily

IXXX           --REPORT 1894.

in this Section but also in the Physical Section and in the Geological

Section.

    By a rule of the Association, proposals for a change in the titles of

Sections must be referred to the Committee of Recommendations for a
report. This Committee will be able to consider any representations

which may be made to them by the Committees of the Sections which

would be affected by the proposed changes.
     The Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee for the past

year has been received and will be presented to the General Committee.
      It is proposed in future to print the account of the Conference of

Delegates in the Annual Report of the same year instead of in that
of the following year. The Report of the Oxford Meeting will therefore
contain an account of the proceedings of the Conference both at Nottingham
and at Oxford.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee, consisting of Mr. Francis
Oalton, Professor R. Meldola, Sir Douglas Galton, Sir Rawson Rawson,

Dr. J. G. Garson, Sir J. Evans, Mr. J. Hopkinson, Mr. W. Whitaker,
Mr. G. J. Symons, Mr. W. Topley, Professor T. G. Bonney, Mr. T. V.

Holmes, Professor E. B. Poulton, Mr. Cuthbert Peek, and the Rev.
Canon Tristram, is hereby nominated for reappointment by the General
Committee.

     The Council nominate Professor Meldola, F.R.S., Chairman, Mr.
Cuthbert E. Peek, Vice-Chairman, and Mr. T. V. Holmes, Secretary, to

the Conference of Delegates of Corresponding Societies to be held during
the Meeting at Oxford.

     In accordance with the regulations, the retiring Members of the

Council will be :

      Sir R. S. Ball.                     Prof. H. Sidgwick.

THE MOST HON. THE MAEQUIS OF SALISBUEY,

    K.G., D.C.L., F.R.S., Chancellor of the University of Oxford,

                                 PRESIDENT.

My -functions are of a more comjDlicated character than usually is

assigned to the occupants of this Chair. As Chancellor of the University

it is my duty to tender to the British Association a hearty welcome, which
it is my duty as President of the Association to accept. As President of

the Association I convey, most unworthily, the voice of English science,

as  many worthy and  illustrious  Presidents  have done before me                                                                                but  in
                                                                                                                                              ;

representing the University I represent far more fittingly the learners

who are longing to hear the lessons which the fii-st teachers of English

science have come as visitors to teach. I am bound to express on behalf

of the University our sense of the good feeling towards that body which

is the motive of this unusual arrangement. But as far as I am personally

concerned, it is attended with some embarrassing results. In presence of

the high priests of science I am only a layman, and all the skill of all the

chemists the Association contains will not transmute a layman into any

more precious kind of metal. Yet it is my hard destiny to have to address

on scientific matters probably the most competent scientific audience in

the world. If a country gentleman, who was also a colonel of Volun-

teers, were by any mental aberration on the part of the Commander-in-

Chief to be appointed to review an army corps at Aldershot, all military

men would doubtless feel a deep compassion for his inevitable fate. I

bespeak some spark of that divine emotion when I am attempting to

discharge under similar conditions a scarcely less hopeless duty. At least,

however, I have the consolation of feeling that I am free from some of the

anxieties which have fallen to those who have preceded me as Presidents

in this city. The relations of the Association and the University are

those of entire sympathy and good will, as becomes common workers in

the sacred cause of difi"using enlightenment and knowledge. But we must

Aadmit that it was not always so.  curious record of a very different

--4 REPORT 1894.

state of feeling came to light last year in the interesting biography of Dr.
Pusey, which is the posthumous work of Canon Liddon. In it is related
the first visit of the Association to Oxford in 1832. Mr. Keble, at that
time a leader of University thought, writes indignantly to his friend to
complain that the honorary degree of D.C.L. had been bestowed upon
some of the most distinguished members of the Association : ' The Oxford
Doctors,' he says, ' have truckled sadly to the spirit of the times in
receiving the hodge-podge of philosophers as they did.' It is amusing, at
this distance of time, to note the names of the hodge-podge of philosophers
whose academical distinctions so sorely vexed Mr. Keble's gentle spirit.

They were Brown, Brewster, Faraday, and Dalton. When we recollect

the lovable and serene character of Keble's nature, and that he was at

that particular date probably the man in the University who had the
greatest power over other men's minds, we can measure the distance we

have traversed since that time ; and the rapidity with which the con-
verging paths of these two intellectual luminaries, the University and the
Association, have approximated to each other. This sally of Mr. Keble's

was no passing or accidental caprice. It represented a deep-seated senti-
ment in this place of learning, which had its origin in historic causes,
and which has only died out in our time. One potent cause of it was
that both bodies were teachers of science, but did not then in any
degree attach the same meaning to that word. Science with the Univer-
sity for many generations bore a signification different from that which
belongs to it in this assembly. It represented the knowledge which alone
in the Middle Ages was thought worthy of the name of science. It was
the knowledge gained not by external observation, but by mere reflection.
The student's microscope was turned inward upon the recesses of his

own brain ; and when the supply of facts and realities failed, as it very

speedily did, the scientific imagination was not wanting to furnish to
successive generations an interminable series of conflicting speculations.

-- --That science science in our academical sense had its day of rapid

 growth, of boundless aspiration, of enthusiastic votaries. It fascinated

--the rising intellect of the time, and it is said people were not particular

--about figures in those days that its attractions were at one time potent

 enough to gather round the University thirty thousand students, who for

 the sake of learning its teaching were willing to endure a life of the

 severest hardship. Such a state of feeling is now an archaeological
 curiosity. The revolt against Aristotle is now some three centuries old.
 But the mental sciences which were supposed to rest upon his writings

 have retained some of their ascendency even till this day, and have only
 slowly and jealously admitted the rivalry of the growing sciences of
 observation. The subject is interesting to us, as this undecided state

 of feeling coloured the experiences of this Association at its last Oxford
 visit, nearly a generation later, in 1860. The warmth of the encounters
 which then took place have left a vivid impression on the minds of those

 who are old enough to have witnessed them. That much energy was on
ADDKESS.                                5

that occasion converted into heat may, I think, be inferred from the

mutual distance which the two bodies have since maintained. Whereas

the visit of 1832 was succeeded by another visit in fifteen years, and the

visit of 1847 was succeeded by another visit in tliirteen years, the year

1860 was followed by a long and dreary interval of separation, which has

only now, after four-and-thirty years, been terminated. It has required

the lapse of a generation to draw the curtain of oblivion over those

animated scenes. It was popularly supposed that deep divergences upon

questions of religion were the motive force of those high controversies.

To some extent that impression was correct. But men do not always

discern the motives which are really urging them, and I suspect that in

many cases religious apprehensions only masked the resentment of the

older learning at the appearance and claims of its younger rival. In any

case there is something worthy of note, and something that conveys

encouragement, in the difference of the feeling which prevails now and

the feeling that was indicated then. Few men are now influenced by the

strange idea that questions of religious belief depend on the issues of

physical research. Few men, whatever their creed, would now seek their

geology in the books of their religion, or, on the other hand, would fancy

that the laboratory or the microscope could help them to penetrate the

mysteries which hang over the nature and the destiny of the soul of man.

And the old learning no longer contests the share in education which is

claimed by the new, or is blind to the supreme influence which natural

knowledge is exercising in moulding the human mind.

   A study of the addresses of my learned predecessors in this office

shows me that the main duty which it falls to a President to perform in

his introductory address, is to remind you of the salient points in the

annals of science since last the Association visited the town in which he

is speaking. Most of them have been able to lay before you in all its

interesting detail the history of the particular science of which each one

of them was the eminent representative. If I were to make any such

attempt I should only be telling you with very inadequate knowledge a

story which is from time to time told you, as well as it can be told, by

men who are competent to deal with it. It will be more suitable to my

capacity if I devote the few observations I have to make to a survey not

Weof our science but of our ignorance.  live in a small bright oasis of

knowledge surrounded on all sides by a vast unexplored region of im-

penetrable mystery. From age to age the strenuous labour of successive

generations wins a small strip from the desert and pushes forward the

boundary of knowledge. Of such triumphs we are justly proud. It is a

-- --less attractive task but yet it has its fascination as well as its uses to

turn our eyes to the undiscovered country which still remains to be won,

to some of the stupendous problems of natural study which still defy our

investigation. Instead, therefore, of recounting to you what has been

done, or trying to forecast the discoveries of the future, I would rather

draw your attention to the condition in which we stand towards three or
--6 REPOKT 1894.

four of the most important physical questions which it has been the effort

of the last century to solve.

Of the scientific enigmas which still, at the end of the nineteenth

century, defy solution, the nature and origin of what are called the

elements is the most notable. It is not, perhaps, easy to give a precise

logical reason for the feeling that the existence of our sixty-five elements

is a strange anomaly and conceals some much simpler state of facts. But

Wethe conviction is irresistible.                                 cannot conceive, on any possible

doctrine of cosmogony, how these sixty-five elements came into existence.

A tliird of them form the substance of this planet. Another third are

useful, but somewhat rare. The remaining third are curiosities scattered

haphazard, but very scantily, over the globe, with no other apparent function

but to provide occupation for the collector and the chemist. Some of them

are so like each other that only a chemist can tell them apart : others differ

immeasurably from each other in every conceivable particular. In co-

hesion, in weight, in conductivity, in melting-point, in chemical proclivities

they vary in every degree. They seem to have as much relation to each

other as the pebbles on a sea beach, or the contents of an ancient lumber

room. Whether you believe that Creation was the work of design or of

inconscient law, it is equally difficult to imagine how this random collection

of dissimilar materials came together. Many have been the attempts to

solve this  enigma                            but  up  till  now  they  have  left  it  more  impenetrable
                                           ;

Athan before. conviction that here was something to discover lay beneath

the persistent belief in the possibility of the transmutation of other metals

into gold, which brought the alchemy of the Middle Ages into being.

When the immortal discovery of Dalton established that the atoms of

each of these elements have a special weight of their own, and that con-

sequently they combine in fixed ponderable proportions from which they

never depart, it renewed the hope that some common origin of the elements

was in sight. The theory was advanced that all these weights were

--multiples of the weight of hydrogen in other words, that each elementary

atom was only a greater or a smaller number of hydrogen atoms compacted

by some strange machinery into one. The most elaborate analyses, con-

--ducted by chemists of the highest eminence conspicuously by the
--illustrious Stas were directed to the question whether there was any

trace in fact of the theoretic idea that the atoms of each element consist

of so many atoms or even of so many half-atoms of hydrogen. But the

--reply of the laboratories has always been clear and certain that there is

not in the facts the faintest foundation for such a theory.

    Then came the discovery of the spectral analysis, and men thought

that with 8.n instrument of such inconceivable delicacy we should at last

find out something as to the nature of the atom. The result has been

wholly disappointing. Spectral analysis in the hands of Dr. Huggins and

Mr. Lockyer and others has taught us things of which the woi'ld little

Weexpected to be told.                                 have been enabled to measure the speed with

which clouds of blazing hydrogen course across the surface of the sun :

-- --we have learnt the pace the fabulous pace at which the most familiar

stars have been for ages approaching to or receding from our planet,

without apparently affecting the proportions of the patterns which as far

as historical record goes back they have always delineated on the even-

Weing sky.  have received some information about the elementary atoms

Wethemselves.   have learnt that each sort of atom when heated strikes

upon the ether a vibration, or set of vibrations, whose rate is all its own ;
and that no one atom or combination of atoms in producing its own spec-

trum encroaches even to the extent of a single line upon the spectrum

Wethat is peculiar to its neighbour.        have learnt that the elements

which exist in the stars and specially in the sun are mainly those with

which we are familiar upon earth. There are a few lines in excess to

which we can give no terrestrial name ; and there are some still more

puzzling gaps in our list. It is a great aggravation of the mystery

which besets the question of the elements, that among the lines which

are absent from the spectrum of the sun, those of nitrogen and oxygen

stand first. Oxygen constitutes the largest portion of the solid and liquid

substance of our planet, so far as we know it ; and nitrogen is very far the

predominant constituent of our atmosphere. If the earth is a detached

bit whirled off the mass of the sun, as cosmogonists loAe to tell us, how

comes it that in leaving the sun we cleaned him out so completely of his

nitrogen and oxygen that not a trace of these gases remains behind to

be discovered even by the sensitive vision of the spectroscope ?

All these things the discovery of spectrum analysis has added to our

knowledge ; but it has left us as ignorant as ever as to the nature of
the capricious differences which separate the atoms from each other, or

the cause to which those differences are due.

In the last few years the same enigma has been approached from another

point of view by Mr. Newlands and Professor Mendeleeff. The periodic

law which they have discovered reflects on them all the honour that can be

earned by ingenious, laborious, and successful research. The Professor has

shown that this perplexing list of elements can be divided into families of

about seven, speaking very roughly : that those families all resemble each

other in this, that as to weight, volume, heat, and laws of combination

the members of each family are ranked among themselves in obedience to

the same rule. Each family differs from the others ; but each internally

--is constructed upon the same plan. It was a strange discovery strangest

of all in its manifest defects. For in the plan of his families there were

blanks left places not filled up because the properly constituted elements
                                             ;

required according to his theory had not been foujid to fill them. For the

moment their absence seemed a weakness in the Professor's idea, and

gave an arbitrary aspect to his scheme. But the weakness was turned

into strength when, to the astonishment of the scientific world, three of

the elements which were missing made their appearance in answer to his

call.  He  had  described  beforehand  the  qualities  they  ought  to  have
                                                                                             ;

--8 EEPORT 1894.

shortly after the publication of his theory, were found to be duly clothed

with the qualities he required in each. This remarkable confirmation has left

MendeleefF's periodic law in an unassailable position. But it has rather

thickened than dissipated the mystery which hangs over the elements.

The discovery of these co-ordinate families dimly points to some identical

origin, without suggesting the method of their genesis or the nature of

their common parentage. If they were organic beings all our difficulties

--would be solved by muttering the comfortable word ' evolution ' one

of those indefinite words from time to time vouchsafed to humanity,

which have the gift of alleviating so many perplexities and masking so
many gups in our knowledge. But the families of elementary atoms do
not breed ; and we cannot therefore ascribe their ordered difference to

accidental variations perpetuated by heredity under the influence of

natural selection. The -rarity of iodine, and the abundance of its sister

chlorine, cannot be attributed to the survival of the fittest in the struggle

Wefor existence.  cannot account for the minute difference which per-

sistently distinguishes nickel from cobalt, by asci'ibing it to the recent
inheritance l)y one of them of an advantageous variation from the parent

stock.

The upshot is that all these successive triumphs of research, Dalton's,

Kirchhoff 's, Mendele'eff's, greatly as they have added to our store of know-
ledge, have gone but little way to solve the problem which the elemen-

tary atoms have for centuries presented to mankind. What the atom of

each element is, whether it is a movement, or a thing, or a vortex, or a

point having inertia, whether there is any limit to its divisibility, and, if

so, how that limit is imposed, whether the long list of elements is final, or
whether any of them have any common origin, all these questions remain

surrounded by a darkness as profound as ever. The dream which lured

the alchemists to their tedious labours, and which may be said to hav&

called chemistry into being, has assuredly not been realised, but it has not
yet been refuted. The boundary of our knowledge in this direction re-

mains where it was many centuries ago.

The next discussion to which I should look in order to find unsolved

riddles which have hitherto defied the scrutiny of science, would be the

question of what is called the ether. The ether occupies a highly anoma-

lous position in the world of science. It may be described as a half-

discovered entity. I dare not use any less pedantic word than entity tO'

designate it, for it would be a great exaggeration of our knowledge if I

were to speak of it as a body or even as a substance. When nearly a

century ago Young and Fresnel discovered that the motions of an incan-

descent particle were conveyed to our eyes by undulation, it followed that
between our eyes and the particle there must be something to undulate.

In order to furnish that something, the notion of the ether was conceived,

and for more than two generations the main, if not the only, function of
the word ether has been to furnish a nominative case to the verb ' to un-

dulate.' Lately, our conception of this entity has received a notable
ADDRESS.                                                      9

extension. One of the most brilliant of the services which Professor

Maxwell has lendered to science has been the discovery that the figure

which expressed the velocity of light also expressed the multiplier

required to change the measure of static or passive electricity into that of

dynamic or active electricity. The interpretation reasonably affixed to

this discoveiy is that, as light and the electric impulse move approximately

at the same rate through space, it is probable that the undulations which

convey them are undulations of the same medium. And as induced

electricity penetrates through everything, or nearly everything, it follows

that the ether through which its undulations are propagated must pervade

all space, whether empty or full, whether occupied by opaque matter or

transparent matter, or by no matter at all. The attractive experiments

by which the late Professor Herz illustrated the electric vibrations of the

ether will only be alluded to by me in order that I may express the

regret deeply and generally felt that death should have terminated pre-

maturely the scientific career which had begun with such brilliant promise

and such fruitful achievements. But the mystery of the ether, though it

has been made more fascinating by these discoveries, remains even more

inscrutable than before. Of this all-pervading entity we know absolutely

nothing except this one fact, that it can be made to undulate. Whether,,

outside the influence of matter on the motion of its Avaves, ether has any

effect on matter or matter upon it, is absolutely unknown. And even its

solitary function of undulating, ether performs in an abnormal fashion

which has caused infinite perplexity. All fluids that we know transmit

any blow they have received by waves which undulate backwards and

forwards in the path of their own advance. The ether undulates athwart

the path of the wave's advance. The genius of Lord Kelvin has recently

discovered what he terms a labile state of equilibrium, in which a fluid that

is infinite in its extent may exist, and may undulate in this eccentric
fashion without outraging the laws of mathematics. I am no mathema-

tician, and I cannot judge whether this reconciliation of the action of the

ether with mechanical law is to be looked upon as a permanent solution

of the question, or is only what diplomatists call a modus vivendi. In any

case it leaves our knowledge of the ether in a very rudimentary condition.

It has no known qualities except one, and that quality is in the highest

degree anomalous and inscrutable. The extended conception which

enables us to recognise ethereal waves in the vibrations of electricity has

added infinite attraction to the study of those waves, but it carries its own

difficulties with it. It is not easy to fit in the theory of electrical ether

waves with the phenomena of positive and negative electricity, and as to

the true significance and cause of those counteracting and complementary

forces, to which we give the provisional names of negative and positive,

we know about as much now as Franklin knew a century and a half ago.

--striking but more obvious instance still is Life animal and vegetable

--Life the action of an unknown force on ordinary matter. What is the

mysterious impulse which is able to strike across the ordinary laws of

matter, and twist them for a moment from their path ? Some people

demur to the use of the term ' vital force ' to designate this impulse. In

their view the existence of such a force is negatived by the fact that

chemists have been able by cunning substitutions to produce artificially

the peculiar compounds which in nature are only found in organisms that

are or have been living. These compounds are produced by some living

organism in the performance of the ordered series of functions proper to

--its brief career. To counterfeit them as has been done in numerous
-- --cases does not enable us to do what the vital force alone can effect to

bring the organism itself into existence, and to cause it to run its appointed
course of change. This is the unknown force which continues to defy not only

our imitation but our scrutiny. Biology has been exceptionally active and

successful during the last half-century. Its triumphs have been brilliant,

and they have been rich enough not only in immediate result but in the

promise of future advance. Yet they give at present no hope of penetrat-

ing the great central mystery. The progress which has been made in the

study of microscopic life has been very striking, whether or not the results

which are at present inferred from it can be taken as conclusive. Infini-

tesimal bodies found upon the roots of plants have the proud office of

capturing and taming for us the free nitrogen of the air, which, if we are
to live at all, we must consume and assimilate, and yet which, without

the help of our microscopic ally, we could not draw for any useful purpose

from the ocean of nitrogen in which we live. Microscopic bodies are

convicted of causing many of the worst diseases to which flesh is heir,
and the guilt of many more will probably be brought home to them in due

time                   and they exercise a scarcely less sinister or less potent        influence on

fruits of husbandry, such as the potato, the mulberry, and the vine.

Almost all their power resides in the capacity of propagating their kind

with infinite rapidity, and up to this time science has been moi'e skilful in

describing their ravages than in devising means to hiiider them. It would

be ungrateful not to mention two brilliant exceptions to this criticism.

The antiseptic surgery which we owe chiefly to Lister ; and the inocula-

tion against anthrax, hydrophobia, and perhaps some other diseases,

which we owe to Pasteur, must be recorded as splendid victories over the

countless legions of our infinitesimal foes. Results like these are the great

glory of the scientific workers of the past century. Men may, perhaps,

have overrated the jarogress of nineteenth-century research in opening

the secrets of nature                                                                   but it is difficult to overrate the brilliant service it

own day, it is not probable that we shall deal more successfully with the

problem as it arose many million years ago. Yet certainly the most

conspicuous event in the scientific annals of the last half- century has been
the publication of Mr. Darwin's work on the ' Origin of Species,' which
appeared in 1859. In some respects, in the depth of the impression which

it made on scientific thought, and even on the general opinion of the
world, its momentous effect can hardly be overstated. But at this dis-
tance of time it is possible to see that some of its success has been due to
adventitious circumstances. It has had the chance of enlisting among its
champions some of the most powerful intellects of our time, and perhaps
the still happier fortune of appearing at a moment when it furnished an
armoury of weapons to men, who were not scientific, for use in the bitter
but transitory polemics of the day. But far the largest part of its
accidental advantages was to be found in the remarkable character and

qualifications of its author. The equity of judgment, the simple-minded
love of truth and the patient devotion to the pursuit of it through years

--of toil and of other conditions the most unpropitious these things en-

deared to numbers of men everything that came from Charles Darwin
apart from its scientific merit or literary charm. And whatever final
value may be assigned to his doctrine, nothing can ever detract from the

lustre shed upon it by the wealth of his knowledge and the infinite in-
genuity of his resource. The intrinsic power of his theory is shown at
least in this one respect, that in the department of knowledge with which
it is concerned it has effected an entire revolution in the methods of
research. Before his time the study of living nature had a tendency to

be merely statistical ; since his time it has become predominantly historical.

The consideration how an organic body came to be what it is occupies a
far larger area in any inquiry now than the mere description of its actual

--condition ; but this question was not predominant it may almost be said

to have been ignored--in the Botanical and Zoological study of sixty

years ago.

     Another lasting and unquestioned effect has resulted from Darwin's

work. He has, as a matter of fact, disposed of the doctrine of the im-

mutability of species. It has been mainly associated in recent days with

the honoured name of Agassiz, but with him has disappeared the last
defender of it who could claim the attention of the world. Few now are
found to doubt that animals separated by differences far exceeding those
that distinguish what we know as species have yet descended from common
 ancestors. But there is much less agreement as to the extent to which
 this common descent can be assumed, or the process by which it has come
 about. Darwin himself believed that all animals were descended from 'at

--most four or five progenitors ' adding that ' there was grandeur in the

 view that life had been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms
 or one.' Some of his more devoted followers, like Professor Haeckel, were

 prepared to go a step farther and to contemplate primeval mud as the

 probable ancestor of the whole fauna and flora of this planet.

      To this extent the Darwinian theory has not effected the conquest of

of natural selection as the sole or even the main agent of whatever

modifications may have led up to the existing forms of life. The deepest

obscurity still hangs over the origin of the infinite variety of life. Two

of the strongest objections to the Darwinian explanation appear still to

retain all their force.

I think Lord Kelvin was the first to point out that the amount of time

required by the advocates of the theory for working out the process they

had imagined could not be conceded without assuming the existence of a

totally different set of natural laws from those with which we are

acquainted. His view was not only based on profound mechanical reason-

ing, but it was so plain that any layman could comprehend it. Setting aside

arguments deduced from the resistance of the tides, which may be taken to

transcend the lay understanding, his argument from the refrigeration of the

earth requires little science to apprehend it. Everybody knows that hot

things cool, and that according to their substance they take more or less

time in cooling. It is evident from the increase of heat as we descend into

the earth, that the earth is cooling, and we know by experiment, within cer-

tain wide limits, the rate at which its substances, the matters of which it

is constituted, are found to cool. It follows that we can approximately

calculate how hot it was so many million years ago. But if at any time

it was hotter at the surface by -50° F. than it is now, life would then have

been impossible upon the planet, and therefore we can without much diffi-

culty fix a date before which organic life on earth cannot have existed.

Basing himself on these considerations Lord Kelvin limited the period of

organic life upon the earth to a hundred million years, and Professor Tait

in a still more penurious spirit cut that hundi-ed down to ten. But on the

other side of the account stand the claims of the geologists and biologists.

They have revelled in the prodigality of the ciphers which they put at the

end of the earth's hypothetical life. Long cribbed and cabined within the

narrow bounds of the popular chronology, they have exulted wantonly in

their new freedom. They have lavished their millions of years with the

open hand of a prodigal heir indemnifying liimself by present extravagance

for the enforced self-denial of his youth. But it cannot be gainsaid that

their theories require at least all this elbowroom. If we think of that

vast distance over which Darwin conducts us from the jelly-fish lying on

the primeval beach to man as we know him                                                           now                      if  we  reflect  that  the
                                                                                                                         ;

prodigious change requisite to transform one into the other is made up of

a chain of generations, each advancing by a minute variation from the

form of its predecessor, and if we further reflect that these successive

--changes are so minute that in the course of our historical period say

--three thousand years this progressive variation has not advanced by a

single step perceptible to our eyes, in respect to man or the animals and
plants with which man is familiar, we shall admit that for a chain of

change so vast, of which the smallest link is longer than our recorded

history, the biologists are making no extravagant claim when they demand
                                                   '

at least many hundred million years for the accomplishment of the stu-

pendous process. Of course, if the mathematicians are right, the biologists

cannot have what they demand. If, for the purposes of their theory, organic
life must have existed on the globe more than a hundred million years
ago, it must, under the temperature then prevailing, have existed in a state
of vapour. The jelly-fish would have been dissipated in steam long before
he had had a chance of displaying the advantageous variation which was

to make him the ancestor of the human race. I see, in the eloquent dis-

course of one of my most recent and most distinguished predecessors in this

chair. Sir Archibald Geikie, that the controversy is still alive. The mathe-
maticians sturdily adhere to their figures, and the biologists are quite sure
the mathematicians must have made a mistake. I will not get myself into
the line of fire by intervening in such a controversy. But until it is
adjusted the laity may be excused for returning a verdict of ' not proven

upon the wider issues the Darwinian school has raised.
     The other objection is best stated in the words of an illustrious disciple

--pf Darwin, Avho has recently honoured this city by his presence I refer

to Professor Weismann. But in referring to him, I cannot but give, in

passing, a feeble expression to the universal sorrow with which in this
place the news was received that Weismann's distinguished antagonist,

Professor Romanes, had been taken from us in the outset and full promise

of a splendid scientific career.

The gravest objection to the doctrine of natural selection was expressed

by Weismann in a paper published a few months ago, not as agreeing to

the objection, but as resisting it ; and therefore his language may be taken

We.as an impartial statement of the difficulty. '  accept natural selection,'

he says, ' not because we are able to demonstrate the process in detail, not

even because we can with more or less ease imagine it, but simply because

we must-- because it is the only possible explanation that we can conceive.

We must assume natural selection to be the principle of the explana-

tion of the metamorphoses, because all other apparent principles of

explanation fail us, and it is inconceivable that there could yet be another

capable of explaining the adaptation of organisms without assuming the

help of a principle of design.'

WeThere is the difficulty.        cannot demonstrate the process of natural

selection in detail ; we cannot even, with more or less ease, imagine it. It

is purely hypothetical. No man, so far as we know, has ever seen it at

work. An accidental variation may have been perpetuated by inhei'itance,

and in the struggle for existence the bearer of it may have replaced, bv

virtue of the survival of the fittest., his less improved competitors ; but as

far as we know no man or succession of men have ever observed the whole
process in any single case, and certainly no man has recorded the obser-
vation. Variation by artificial selection, of course, we know very well

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but the intei'vention of the cattle breeder and the pigeon fancier is the
essence of artificial selection. It is effected by their action in crossing,

by their skill in bringing the right mates together to produce the progeni-
                                                                     -

--14 REPORT 1894.

ture they want. But in natural selection who is to supply the breeder's
place 1 Unless the crossing is properly arranged, the new breed will never
come into being. What is to secure that the two individuals of opposite
sexes in the primeval forest, who have been both accidentally blessed with
the same advantageous variation, shall meet, and transmit by inheritance
that variation to their successors 1 Unless this step is made good, the

modification will never get a start ; and yet there is nothing to insure that

step, except pure chance. The law of chances takes the place of the cattle
breeder and the pigeon fancier. The biologists do well to ask for an im-

measurable expanse of time, if the occasional meetings of advantageously

varied couples from age to age are to provide the pedigree of modifications

which unite us to our ancestor the jelly-fish. Of course the struggle for

existence, and the survival of the fittest, would in the long run secure the

predominance of the stronger breed over the weaker. But it would be of

no use in setting the improved breed going. There would not be time.

No possible variation which is known to our experience, in tlie short time

that elapses in a single life between the moment of maturity and the age

of reproduction, could enable the varied individual to clear the field of all

competitors, either by slaughtering or starving them out. But unless the

struggle for existence took this summary and internecine character, there

would be nothing but mere chance to secure that the advantageously

varied bridegroom at one end of the wood should meet the bride, who by

a happy contingency had been advantageously varied in the same direction

at the same time at the other end of the wood. It would be a mere chance

--if they ever knew of each other's existence a still more unlikely chance

that they should resist on both sides all temptations to a less advantageous

alliance. But unless they did so, the new breed would never even begin,

let alone the question of its perpetuation after it had begun. I think
Professor Weismann is justified in saying that we cannot, either with

more or less ease, imagine the process of natural selection.

It seems strange that a philosopher of Professor Weismann's penetra-

tion should accept as established a hypothetical process the truth of which

he admits that he cannot demonstrate in detail, and the operation of which

he cannot even imagine. The reason that he gives seems to me instructive

--of the great danger scientific research is running at the present time the

acceptance of mere conjecture in the name and place of knowledge, in pre-

ference to making frankly the admission that no certain knowledge can

               accept natural selection,' he says, 'because we must

because it is the only possible explanation that we can conceive.' As a

politician, I know that argument very well. In political controversy it is

sometimes said of a disputed proposal that it ' holds the field,' that it must

be accepted because no possible alternative has been suggested. In politics

there is occasionally a certain validity in the argument, for it sometimes

happens that some definite course must be taken, even though no course

is free from objection. But such a line of reasoning is utterly out of place

not provide a sound one. To the riddles which nature propounds to us the
profession of ignorance must constantly be our only reasonable answer.
The cloud of impenetrable mystery hangs over the development and still
more over the origin of life. If we strain our eyes to pierce it, with the fore-
gone conclusion that some solution is and must be attainable, we shall
only mistake for discoveries the figments of our own imagination. Pro-
fessor AYeismann adds another reason for his belief in natural selection
which is certainly characteristic of the time in which we live. ' It is in-

conceivable,' he says, ' that there should be another principle capable of
explaining the adaptation of organisms without assuming the help of a
principle of design.' The whirligig of time assuredly brings its revenges.

Time was, not very long ago, when the belief in creative design was
supreme. Even those who were sapping its authority were wont to pay
it a formal homage, fearing to shock the public conscience by denying it.

Now the revolution is so complete that a great philosopher uses it as a

reductio ad absurdum, and prefers to believe that which can neither be
demonstrated in detail, nor imagined, rather than run the slightest risk of

such a heresy.
      I quite accept the Professor's dictum that if natural selection is rejected

we have no resource but to fall back on the mediate or immediate agency

of a principle of design. In Oxford, at least, he will not find that argument

is conclusive, nor, I believe, among scientific men in this country generally,
however imposing the names of some whom he may claim for that belief.

I would rather lean to the conviction that the multiplying difficulties of
the mechanical theory are weakening the influence it once had acquired.
I prefer to shelter myself in this matter behind the judgment of the
greatest living master of natural science among us. Lord Kelvin, and to

quote as my own concluding Avords the striking language with which he

closed his address from this chair more than twenty years ago : ' I have

always felt,' he said, ' that the hypothesis of natural selection does not

contain the true theory of evolution, if evolution there has been in biology.
... I feel profoundly convinced that the argument of design has been greatly

too much lost sight of in recent zoological speculations. Overpoweringly
strong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie around us, and if ever
perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn us away from them
for a time, they come back upon us with irresistible force, showing to us

through nature the influence of a free will, and teaching us that all living
things depend on one everlasting Creator and Ruler.'

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Dr.
Garson (in the chair), Mr. Topley, Mr. Symons, and Mr. T. V. Holmes

(Secretary).

     Dr. Garson, the Chairman, gave a hearty welcome to the delegates

present. He stated that these Conferences were began at Aberdeen in

188-5. At that time only twenty-four delegates were appointed, while
last year there were forty-two. The number of Corresponding Societies
had also increased. This was evidence that the attempt to brincr to a
focus, as it were, the efforts of the various Corresponding Societies had met
with considerable success. But there was also evidence that the Societies

did not always sufficiently value fheir privileges. When the annual

vcturua were sent out from the office of the British Association the
.

majority of the Secretaries of the Corresponding Societies did not fill up

and return them until they were written to a second time. Again, oat
of more than sixty Societies, only forty-two thought it worth while to

nominate delegates, though it could hardly be a difficult matter to find
members able and willing to serve. It was a very great advantage to

the workers in the various local Societies to have the titles of their papers

printed and published in the Annual Reports of the British Association.

The Transactions of the various Corresponding Societies were bound and

kept available for reference at present in the Office of the Association at

Burlington House, whereas papers read before other local Societies

were not unlikely to remain unknown or unconsalted. It was most

desirable that the British Association should be brought into closer

communication with the Societies. It had been usual hitherto fur repre-

sentatives from the different Sections to attend the Conferences and to

mention anything that had been done, such as the appointment of a

committee for some special purpose, in which the co-operation of the

Corresponding Societies would be advantageous. It would be a good

thing that there should be better means of communication between the

Corresponding Societies and the Secretaries of the various committees

Aappointed by the British Association.  good example of a committee

especially needing the assistance of the Corresponding Societies was that

Hnominated by Section to make an Ethnographical Survey of the United

Kingdom. The first Report of this committee had just been presented to

the delegates, and Mr. Brabrook, the Secretary, would shortly call their

attention to it. At their last meeting at Edinburgh some delegates had

asked whether the Council of the Association might not be able to obtain

greater facilities from the railway companies for members travelling to

and from these meetings. The Council consequently appointed a com-

mittee, of which Sir Frederick Bramwell was an active member, to see
what could be done, The result, however, could not be deemed satis-

factoiy. The Clearing House authorities considered that the ordinary

tourists' tickets met the requirements of the case, and reminded them

that return tickets were issued to members at a single fare for distances

not exceeding fifty miles from the place of meeting. The local authorities

had placed the room in which they then were at the disposal of the

delegates, and in it they might meet to discuss matters at any time.

The Secretary read a letter from Sir Douglas Galton, expressing his

regret at being unable to attend the Conference.

     The Chairman proposed to take the Report which was in their hands

as read. He would be glad to hear any remarks from delegates on the

work done during the past year.

                                                    Section A.

  --Meteorological PhotograpJiy Mr. Symons was much indebted to the

delegates for the number of photographs of clouds sent in to the Com-
mittee up to the pi'esent time. He did not press for more, as the
Committee appointed by the British Association for the ' Elucidation of
Meteorological Phenomena by the Application of Photography ' had the
very considerable collection of 467 to deal with. They proposed to
select the typical ones, reduce them to a uniform scale, and print perhaps
a hundred copies of them. They hoped to publish the atlas during the
22 REPORT-- 1894.

year, and would be glad if the meteorologists would take copies. They
would be pleased to have additional photographs of lightning.

     Mr. Kenward remarked that through the agency of the standing
Meteorological Committee of the Birmingham Philosophical Society com-
plete weather statistics for Birmingham had been obtained from the
observatory in Monument Road. It was believed that the periodical pub-
lication of these records would supply a great want.

                                                     Section C.

     Mr. A. S. Reid said that the Geological Photographs Committee of
the British Association were publishing their fourth Report tliis year.
During the year they had received more than forty new photographs,
making the total collection 846 : they were all British. Their appeal
to the Corresponding Societies had been more successful than in any

previous year, but there was still much to be done, and he hoped the
delegates would stir up their Societies on this point. As to the best
camera, the most portable was to be preferred. He had also to report
that many prints had been sent in without the name of the Societies

sending them, that of the photographer, or that of the place photographed.

They had decided not to lend any more photographs to the Societies,
unless such photographs were sent in duplicate. Mr. Jeffs, the Secretary
of the Geological Photographs Committee, had unfortunately been ill
during nearly the whole of the year, and this had seriously hampered

their work.

    Mr. Tate said that, with refei'ence to geological photographs, many of
those sent in were probably of little value. He trusted that some day

the Geological Photographs Committee would be able to select typical
examples and place them where they would be of use to the Corresponding
Societies. Some had been sent from Belfast, the district he represented.

      Mr. P. F. Kendall remarked that few of the Corresponding Societies
during the past year had given any information to the British Associa-
tion Committee appointed to record the Character and Position of Erratic
Blocks, though appeals for help had been made.

     The Chairman hoped that the delegates present would note this

omission.

      In reply to a question from Mr. Eli Sowerbutts Mr. Kendall said tliat
though the Erratic Blocks Committee had been in existence twenty-one
years, there were whole counties abounding in erratic blocks from which
not a single report had ever been sent. There were thus great gaps in
their information which could only be filled by photographs and reports
from the quarters which had hitherto not responded to the appeal. Most
admirable work had been done in Warwickshire.

     Mr. Topley inquired whether any Society had made researches, like
those brought before the Conference last year by Mr. Watts, as to the
quantity of material brought down streams in flood in the neighbourhood

of Rochdale.

     Mr. Mark Stirrup thought the work, so far as it had gone, had been

brought before the Manchester Geographical Society.

     Mr. Symons said that the work had been confined to the Rochdale
district. It was desirable that results in other districts should be noted,
and ail persons wishing to do similar work should consult Mr. Watts at
Strines Dale, Oldham.

                                                  Section D,

     Mr. Slater recorded the interesting fact that a member of the York-
shire Naturalists' Union recently found the wild maidenhair fern on
the northern portion of Morecambe Bay. It would not be desirable that
the exact spot should be given. He would also remark that it was better

to obtain seeds from these rare plants than to take the plant itself.

                                                    Section E.

     Mr. Sowerbutts remarked that their member, Mr. Crook, went before
the departmental committee appointed to consider the state of the

Ordnance Survey in order to give evidence. He had suggested to Mr.

Crook that he should write a report on what had been done by the
departmental committee, which miglit be presented at the next year's
meeting of delegates. The examination on Yorkshire mentioned in the
report of the Conference of Delegates at Edinburgh did not take place.
They would, however, conduct some examinations next year, and he
would be glad if the delegates would make their intentions widely
known. It was his opinion that there was no cheap book in existence
giving a fairly good account of Yorkshire. The examinations were open
to all public and private schools. There would be one on Canada for

secondary school children. They had been found to know nothing about

geography last year, and he looked for some improvement next time.

     Mr. Hembry had learned that in a certain county children attending
schools were not taught geography in any way. He would like to know

if this was the case anywhere else.

    Mw Andrews remarked that, acting on the advice of Mr. Whitaker,

he had forwarded a list of thirteen ancient earthworks in Warwickshire
to the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, ten of which had since
been inserted in the map.

     Mr. Hembry thought that geography should certainly be a class

subject. In secondary schools they absolutely ignored it ; but he had
been astonished to find that an immense advance had been made in the
teaching of geography in primary schools. In many of the latter museums

of commercial products were now being formed.

                                                    Section G.

     Professor Merivale had nothing to report about Flameless Explosives.

                                                Section H.

     Mr. Brabrook made some remarks on the progress made by the
Committee appointed to make an Ethnographical Survey of the
United Kingdom, whose first report was in the hands of the delegates.
The Committee had, he said, obtained, by communication with the
Corresponding Societies, a list of nearly SOO villages, with some account
--24 i;epout 189i.

of their leading ftaturcs and peculiarities, all of wLicli were wortli'j of

special examination by the Committee. For this result, which was much

bejond their anticipations, the Ethnographical Committee gave their most

hearty thanks to the members of the Corresponding Societies who had
he]23ed them so efficiently. The next step taken by the Committee had
been to draw up a brief code of directions for the guidance of those who
had been kind enough to offer assistance. This code would be found

at the end of their Report.

     Mr. Kenward said that almost all traces of the past had been destroyed
in the Birmingham district. They had, however, established a Folklore

Sub-committee.
     Mr. Brabrook thought that delegation to sub-committees greatly

facilitated the work.

     Mr. Kenward remarked that in Birmingham they were carefully
noting the physical condition of individual children in Board schools,
also that of factory hands. Next year they hoped to present a Report on

the subject to the Association.

The Chairman said that the Sectional discussions being now ended,

he would be glad to hear remarks of any kind that might be of general

interest to the delegates.

Dr. Arlidge suggested that a tabular list should be prepared of tlio

Committees of the Association with which it was desired that the-

Corresponding Societies should co-operate.

Mr. Mark Stirrup said that each year a list of the whole of tlie

British Association Committees was printed and distributed, the name.'j-

of the membei*s and the objects of the committees being given. Ho-

always brought this list before his Society, and asked members to note

anything in which they might like to assist.

Mr.  T.  V.  Holmes  stated  that,  when  writing  in  the 'Essex                                                               *'

                                                                   Naturalist

an account of the Edinburgh Conference for the Essex Field Club last

autumn, he added to his remarks a list of the ten or eleven Committees-

in which the Corresponding Societies were specially interested.

            Nottingham, Second Conference, September 19, 1893.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Dr.
Garson (in the chair), Mr. F. Galton, Mr. Syraons, and Mr. T. V.Holmes

(Secretary).

    The Chairman thought it would be best to take first any discussions
upon the committees appointed in the various Sections.

                                                   Section A.

     Mr. Symons said that the work of the Earth-tremors Committee
was going on under the care of Mr. Davison, and he did not think

Athat there were other committees connected with Section that bore

upon the work of the delegates. With regard to the Report of the Earth-

tremors Committee, he should like to hold it in suspense for a while,
in the hope of future co-operation with some of the Corresponding

Societies.
COKRESrO^DlNU SOCIKTIKS.  25

     Mr. M. H. Mills thought that earth -tremors was one of the subjects
in which members of the Federated Institute of Mining Engineers could

assist.

     Mr. Symons inquired if it would be possible to place instruments-

underground at a depth of 100 feet.
     Mr. Mills did not think there would be any difiGculty.

     Mr. Mark Stirrup said that some mining engineers thought that ft

would be useless to place apparatus in mines because of the vibration
caused by the workings.

     Mr. Symons said that fortunately no difficulty would arise from that

cause, as the instruments, though extremely delicate, were not sensitive

to vibrations of short period.

     Mr. Kenward thought that he knew of a colliery in which instruments

could be placed.

                                                     Section C.

     Mr. A. S. Reid said he had been asked by the Sectional Committee
to make some remarks. The Underground Waters Committee would
present their final Report next year, and would be glad to receive further
information up to the date of publication. The Geological Photographs
Committee thought that the size of photographs should be left to the
donors. As to the best camera further comments from practical
photographers were invited ; also remarks as to the best methods of
printing. With regard to publication, negotiations respecting the pro-
posed album of i-epresentative photographs were then in progress.
The Erratic Blocks Committee had presented a Report, and they were
going to publish as much as they could as soon as possible. The Coast
Erosion Committee had not sent in a Report, though they had plenty of
material in hand. The Committee on Type Specimens in Museums were
making arrangements for the i-egistration of those specimens, and in-
formation was required as to where they were housed.

     Mr. Tate inquired, with regard to geological photographs, if smali
photographs taken with a good lens were not preferred.

     Mr. Reid replied that the Committee were i-eady to receive any good

photographs.

                                                   Section D.

  --Protection of Wild Birds' Eggs. Mr. Slater thought it was high time

something was done to protect the eggs of wild birds. Influence might

be brought to bear upon boys. Ho also deprecated the wanton shooting

of gulls.

     The Chairman stated that the Committee had been reappointed, and
that the delegates would in due time receive a final communication on

the question.

     Mr. C. H. Torr (Nottingham) said that a valuable suggestion had
been made that County Councils, and through them Board schools,
should put up notices during the season asking boys not to take eggs. It

was of little use to talk of legislation, as the eggs would be gone before

it could be obtained.

     The Chairman remarked that at Edinburgh much had been said
about the number of rare eggs in the possession of collectors.
     --

26 BEPORT-- 1894.

     Mr. Andrews recently visited a small village inn in North War-
wickshire, where he saw cases of birds' eggs arranged in the form of
crowns. These crowns were sold for £b each.

     Mr. Kenward thought it would be better to appeal to the common-
sense and humanity of the collector than to pat up notices in Board

schools.

     Mr. Symons thought an appeal to the common-sense of the people
would have a good efiiect, and that it was useless to trust to legislation.
People who made crowns of eggs were irreclaimable.

      Mr. Torr said, on behalf of Nottingham, tliat he -would undertake
that the matter should be brought before the School Board.

   --Museums. Mr. Holmes read a letter from Mr. W. Cole, Hon. Sec.

Essex Field Club, on the maintenance of local museums. Mr. Cole
thousrht that if an annual sum for the maintenance of local museums
could be obtained from the Technical Education Grants in each county
there would be no great difficulty in obtaining substantial sums towards

buildings and fittings. The fear that a museum might not be permanent
often kept back subscriptions. Donations, both of money and of specimens,
would rapidly come in when once the public felt that the museum would
be permanent ; and in no way could a portion of the Technical Educa-

tion Grant be better expended than in placing on a satisfactory footing

the local museum of the county,
     Mr. Symons thought the idea of getting a grant from the source

suggested a very good one.
     The Chairman hoped that members of the Corresponding Societies

would occasionally read papers on the specimens in their local museums,
each writer keeping to a certain department. These papers, if published,
would be catalogued in the Association's list, and brought before the
notice of many workers in the same stibject elsewhere. They would also
be available for reference at headquarters in London.

    AMr. Stirrup believed that something had been done in that way.

Museums Association had been started, and had met that year in London.
In the report from the Owens College Museum there was a paper dealing

with the subject of type specimens.

     The Chairman thought that the object of the Museums Association
was rather to discuss the best kinds of general arrangement than to
describe the contents of museums.

     Mr. Stirrup and Mr. Tate both expressed an opinion that descriptions
of type specimens would be very valuable.

                                             Section H.

     The Chairman said that, as representative of Section H, he had
to draw the attention of the delegates and the Corresponding Societies

to the

  --Ethnographical Survey of the United Kingdom. The first Report of

the Committee had been placed in the hands of the delegates at their
first conference, and he hoped they would bring it before their respective
Societies, as the kind of work required is essentially local and such as
would give great scope for investigation to the members of their Societies.
It includes observations on (1) the physical types of the inhabitants, to be
ascertained by photographing and recording the characters and measure-

ments and other remains of ancient culture; (5) historical evidence as to

continuity of race. The Report contains minute directions as to how the

investigations are to be made.

  -- HExploration of Ancient Remains. The Committee of Section had

passed the following resolution, to whicli they desired the attention of

--the Corresponding Societies to be drawn : ' That in the opinion of this

Section it is desirable that the attention of archasologists and others be

particularly called to the great importance of preserving with the utmost

care all human remains found in ancient dwellings, graves, tumuli, and

other burial places. It is equally as important to preserve the limb-

bones and pelvis as the skull. The information yielded by human and

animal remains is equally as important as that derived from pottery,

implements, coins, &c. When any difficulty occurs in obtaining com-

petent aid in examining such remains, explorers are requested to com-

municate with the Secretary, Anthropological Institute, 3 Hanover

Square, London, W.' He said that it was much better not to attempt to

excavate barrows, &c., unless it was done thoroughly.

     After some remarks on a proposed excursion of the delegates a vote
of thanks to the Chairman closed the proceedings.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee, in accordance with the an-
nouncement made to the General Committee, present the following Report
of the Oxford Conference :

     The Council nominated Professor R. Meldola Chairman, Mr. Cuth-
bert E. Peek Vice-Chaii-man, and Mr. T. V. Holmes Secretary to the
Conference. These nominations were confirmed at the meeting of the
General Committee held at Oxford on Wednesday, August 8.

     The meetings of the Conference of Delegates of the Corresponding

Societies were held on Thursday, August 9, and on Tuesday, August 14,

in the New Examination Schools, at 3.30 p.m. The following Correspond-

ing Societies nominated delegates to represent them at the Oxford

meeting :

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Professor
R. Meldola (Chairman), Pi-ofessor T. G. Bonney, Sir John Evans, Sir
Douglas Galton, Dr. Garson, Mr. J. Hopkinson, Mr. Cuthbert Peek, Sir

Rawson Rawson, Mr. G. J. Symons, Mr. W. Topley, Mr. W. Whitaker,

and Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary).

     The Chairman remarked that as this was their tenth Conference it
had been suggested to him that it would afford a good opportunity for a

review of the work done during that period. On the whole, however, he

thought that a review of that kind might form a dangerous precedent, as
tending to the delivery of an annual address which would occupy time
more profitably spent in discussing topics in which the delegates were
specially interested. Hitherto, owing to a bye-law enacting that the
Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee should be presented to the

   General Committee of the British Association, the Reports of these Confer-
   ences had always been a year behind ; that held at Edinburgh in 1892, for
   example, appearing in the British Association volume giving an account of
   the proceedings at Nottingham in 1893, Steps had been taken, however,
   to prevent this delay in future, and in the Oxford Report of the British
   Association the account of the Nottingham Conference and that of the
   Oxford Conference would appear together. In order that there should be
  no want of material for discussion at these Conferences, their Secretary
  and he had written to the Recorder of each Section asking him to bring the
   existence of the Conference of Delegates under the notice of investigators
  in those departments of science of which the work might be aided by the

  co-operation of local observers. They had also taken a new departure in
  announcing beforehand that some special subject would be discussed at
  the Conference. On this occasion they had been fortunate enough to

  secure the attendance of Mr. Cuthbert Peek to open a discussion on Local
  Museums.

       Mr. Cuthbert Peek, after stating that he was under great obligations
  to that admirable organisation, the Museums Association, said that he

  proposed to deal with the subject under the following headings :

           1. Methods of registration and cataloguing.
           2. The protection of specimens from injury and dust.
           3. The circulation of specimens and type-collections for educational

                        purposes.

           4. Central referees for nomenclature and classification.
          5. The most satisfactory methods of making museums attractive.

         6. Museum lectures and demonstrations.
          7. The relations between museums and County Councils.

--I 1. Methods of Registration and Cataloguing. Having examined several

 systems before arranging a small general museum of his own, he had come
 to the conclusion that for small museums the card catalogue was the most
  convenient on account of the ease with which changes and additions

  could be made. Sectional letters distinguished the various classes of

 objects. Each specimen when received had a number allotted to it under
 the letter assigned to the Section. In order that the number might remain
 attached to the specimen, he painted the letter and number on the speci-
 men with red or white paint, and gave them when dry a coat of oil

 varnish. When practicable it was a good thing to paste a photograph

 showing the locality at which the object was found at the back of the
 card. Labels were often displaced by the careless cleaner, but if the exact
 dimensions of a specimen, with a rough outline of it, were entered on the
 back of a card, identification would always be possible.

    --2. The Protection of Specimens from Injury and Dust. On this subject

 it was necessary to remind them that every closed case was practically
 acted upon by changes in the pressure of the atmosphere (in the same
 way as the cistern of a mercurial barometer), and that it drew in or gave
 out air and dust with every change of pressure. Professor Miall, at the
 Yorkshire College, had a rectangular hole cut in the top of each case and

 covered with damiette. This filters the air passing in. He (Mr. Peek)

 felt inclined to use a tube filled with cotton-wool for this purpose. It
 must be remembered that enough air should be admitted at the authorised
 entrance to prevent supplies from being sucked in through the inevitable
 joints and cracks elsewhere.
30 REPORT-- 1894.

  --3. The Circulation of Specimens and Tyj)e-collections for EducationaZ

Purjyoses. The importance of educating the eye was now generally recog-

nised and the London scientific societies are more and more introducing the

optical lantern at their evening meetings. The advantage of the circula-

tion of loan collections illustrating the subjects taught in elementary

schools was therefore obvious. At Liverpool a system had been elaborated

by which loan collections were prepared and circulated among a large

number of schools. Experience had shown that the collections should be

arranged in cabinets, each containing some special class of objects, such as

food products, woods, &c. Those wishing to organise a plan for the circu-

lation of collections of this kind should consult a Paper by Mr. J. Chard

in the Report of the Museums Association for 1890.

The educational advantages of a museum were much increased by a

liberal use of pictorial illustrations placed as near as possible to the objects

illustrated. In the case of minute objects drawings on a larger scale were

of the highest value, while models and casts were often of the utmost

service. Labels should be clear, and should indicate the most important

points in plain language. When specimens could be replaced without

difficulty a certain amount of handling might be permitted. It was most

desirable that overcrowding should be avoided, and that the utmost care

should be taken in the selection of type-specimens. Much economy of

space would result from the adoption of an American invention which he

would briefly describe. The side of the cabinet, instead of having one

slide for each drawer, has a series of slides, one inch apart, all the way up

the side, the bottom of each drawer having a tongue to fit into one of

these slides. It was clear from this that the drawers might be made in

multiples of an inch and arranged in any order desired.

   --4. Central Referees for Nomenclature and Classification. One of the

greatest difficulties which the average curator of a small museum had

to deal with was the nomenclature of the vai'ied specimens under his

Ancharge.  organisation of specialists who would for a small fee allow

specimens to be forwarded to them for identification would be of t?ie

greatest possible value. Certain abstruse questions might not even then

be easy to answer ; but if nine-tenths of our museum specimens could be

accurately catalogued a great step in the right dii-ection would be taken.

  --5. The most satisfactory Method of making Musextms attractive. To

those who know the museums at South Kensington, or some of the equally

well-arranged local museums, this heading might seem unnecessary.

But many present might be able to call to mind some collection in a

country town containing many most valuable local specimens, the very

existence of which was unknown to the majority of the inhabitants.

This state of things was yearly becoming rarer ; but many persons could
point out some museum almost as much fossilised as the fossils it con-

tained, with labels either illegible from age or invisible from displacement.

Those who casually entered such museums seldom revisited them. It

was most desirable that the English as well as the Latin name of a
specimen should be given. Much might be done to allow of comparisons

between creatures of different families or genera. Thus, at the Natural

History Museum, South Kensington, the skeletons of a man and of a

horse in the attitude of running had recently been placed the one in front

of the other, so that the relations of the two, bone for bone, could be dis-

tinctly seen. The surgical, ordinary, and veterinary names of the bones

were added throughout
         CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                   31

--6. Museum Lectures and Demonstrations. While the great value of

case-to-case explanations was invariably admitted, the difficulty attending

any attempt to make a museum demonstration useful to any large number

of persons was equally obvious. One most experienced demonstrator had

stated tliat the largest number that can receive real benefit from a case-

to-case demonstration is about a dozen, and had recommended that the

lecture, illustrated by specimens and lantern slides, should be given in an

ordinary lecture-room, and a demonstration afterwards in the museum to

the smaller number seeking further information. In any case it was most

desirable that the demonstrator should be placed on a temporary stand, so

that he might see and be seen by his audience.

   --7. Tlie Relations between Museums and County Councils. It having

always appeared to him that demonstrations in museums should take a

very prominent part in technical education, especially in rural districts,

he had been surprised that so little assistance had been given in aid of

local collections by County Councils. In order to ascertain what had been

done in that direction he had sent out a circular to county council

technical education committees, and found that local museums and free

libraries had been assisted only in nine cases. The County Council of

Cunilierland had been the most liberal, having made a grant of 600^. per

annum during the last three years for the purpose of aiding the Corpora-

Ation of Carlisle to erect a museum, free library, and art school.  grant

had also been made to a free library at Whitehaven for the purchase of

text-books for the use of students at technical instruction classes, and a

grant of 200Z. per annum had been given to the local board of Millom in

aid of the free library and technical school at that town. In Westmor-

land a grant of 100^. had been made to the Kendal Free Library, and a

similar sum had been given for the purchase of books on scientific sub-

jects at other centres in the county. In Northumberland 50 per cent, of

the cost of technical books for village and other libraries had (under

certain conditions) been defrayed. At Leeds grants had been made to

the Free Public Libi-ary Committee of the Corporation for the purchase

of pictures and books. In Hertfordshire money had been given to free

libraries for the purchase of technical books, and in Montgomery grants

had been made in two cases. In Surrey no aid had been given to free

libraries, but it was proposed to found a museum in connection with

buildings for technical education and a reference library. The London

County Council had a proposal to aid a certain museum under con-

sideration ; and in Dorsetshire the museums at Poole, Dorchester, and
Sherborne had all received aid. From some counties no information had

yet been received, but enough had been stated to show that there was no

insuperable obstacle to the application of money intended for technical

Aeducation to the development of museums.   leading object with the

Government was the development of local activity, and he felt convinced

that any grants made to local museums and free libraries would tend more

than anything else to further that object.

In conclusion Mr. Peek drew attention to the magnificent museum

founded at Oxford by General Pitt-Rivers, the arrangement of which was

unique.

The Chairman thought they were much indebted to Mr. Peek for his

paper, and invited remarks thereon.

     Sir John Evans said that Mr. Peek had left little for anyone to add.
The card catalogue would commend itself to everyone on account of the
32 REPORT-- 1894.

facility with which it could be consulted, but it was a question whether

^he American system of having a perforated card through which a wire

passed, so that the card could not be disturbed, was not preferable. The

suggestion that a slight sketch of the object should be made on the back

·of the card was a valuable one. In the British Museum the date at
which an object was received was generally painted upon it. He would

"be glad if anyone could suggest any means by which the ordinary cabinet

could be kept free from dust. It exhaled air when the day was warm,

and inhaled it in the cooler evening. He had tried a lining of cotton-
wool, but did not think the result was perfectly satisfactory. He thought

a cabinet constructed on the American principle, alluded to by Mr. Peek,

would be liable to dust unless its door was extremely close-fitting, but he had

applied the principle in a somewhat ditFerent manner. As regards referees

for nomenclature and classification, an association like that suggested

would, no doubt, be useful but at the present time any curator might

·consult the keepers of the various departments of the British Museum,

either at South Kensington or at Bloomsbury, with a certainty of prompt

.and valuable assistance. He doubted whether grants to museums would

he permitted to pass by the Government auditors, though a grant of

technical books to a local museum might be allowed. In thanking

Mr. Peek for the manner in which he had brought this subject before

them, he was sure that he gave utterance to the feeling of all present.

The Rev. O. P. Cambridge believed that in some cases County Councils

had made gi-ants which they were not altogether legally entitled to make,

but which, from the good work done, were not likely to be called in ques-

tion. As regards the obliteration of labels, he had a large collection of

specimens in spirits of wine, and had been in the habit of gumming labels

on the outside. In the course of years he had found that these labels soon

became spotted and indistinct, and had consequently Avritten new labels

on good paper with a pencil and placed them inside the glass jars with the

most satisfactory results.

Sir Rawson Rawson, whose experience had been partly tropical, had

not always found pencil marks indelible.

The Rev. O. P. Cambridge wished to add that some care was necessary

in selecting a pencil, which should neither be very hard nor very soft.

     Dr. Garson could corroborate what had been said as to the advantages

of using pencils in spirit preparations. No kind of ink would answer, but

a pencil mark would remain a very long time after immersion in spirit.

It was an advantage to use a rough paper.

Mr. W. Gray thought they were all much indebted to Mr. Peek for

the admirable way in which he had handled the subject. It was first

necessary  to  stir  up  an  interest in a locality  in  order to  get a  museum
                                                                                                         ;

secondly, to have the specimens properly housed ; and thirdly, to make

the museum attractive. To be attractive it must be educational, and

arrangements should be made for the circulation of some of the cases

through the couuti'y. Aid may then be fairly demanded from the County

·or City Council. The circulation of specimens did away with the dull,

dusty monotony so characteristic of some museums, and which usually

prevented them from being visited more than once or twice. Variation in

the aspect of a museum constituted a most important element of attraction.

In Belfast, through the agency of the Society he represented, they had

established the Belfast Central Museum, Art Gallery, and Library. Sir

John Evans had given the museum three or four thousand valuable
       CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                     33

specimens. But they were still wanting in a proper organisation of their

local museum for educational purposes, and the sentiments expressed at
that meeting would enable him to urge the matter with additional
emphasis before the Town Council.

    Mr. T. W. Shore stated that three years ago he had moved a resolu-

tion, at the Cambridge meeting of the Museums Association, pledging
the Association to do what it could to obtain aid for museums from

County Councils. He hoped that the gathering before him might be able

to aid the movement in some way. Mr. Peek had mentioned that the

clerks of many County Councils expressed doubts as to the legality of
grants to museums, but Mr. Cambridge had shown how the difficulty
might be overcome. It was clear that grants could be made by County

Councils to defray the expense of lectures and demonstrations in museums.

He would therefore suggest that circulars might be sent to County

Councils pointing out that, in the opinion of that meeting, grants in aid

of lectures and demonstrations in museums might be made with excellent
educational results and without any risk of going beyond the law.

Mr. Sowerbutts remarked that, though County Councils might be

subject to the Government Auditor, County Borouglis were (he thought)

not so controlled. In Lancashire they did not trouble the auditors, but
when the councillors became extravagant they turned them out at the

next election.

    Mr. Kenward said that in Birmingham the Corporation had established

an excellent museum and an art gallery which were entirely supported by

the rates. They had never sought aid from the County Council.

     Mr. T. V. Holmes had in his hands a letter from Mr. William Cole,
Secretary to the Essex Field Club, who was intimately acquainted with
the system of technical education as it was carried out in Essex. Mr.

Cole lamented that nothing had been granted by the County Council to
aid museums, but thought that to do so was probably beyond their legal

powers, and hoped for an amendment of the Act. He would doubtless be

cheered by Mr. Peek's observations on that point, which showed that

--grants to museums were by no means unquestionably illegal to say the

least. Mr. Cole's experience had given him a very low notion of the

efficiency of mere lecturing, especially in rural districts. Of course a

lecturer usually brought specimens with him, but with the departure of

the lecturer the specimens also departed, and scarcely any real interest in

the subject was aroused. What was really wanted was a permanent central

museum which was continually sending forth loan collections to the remoter-

districts, and which allowed them to remain there for a certain time
after the lectures, illustrated by these collections, had been given. Mr.
Cole, however, did not think that museums should be entirely worked by
County Councils, as that would greatly weaken the interest taken in
museums by the naturalists and field clubs who had usually originated

them. But the funds of almost all societies of naturalists were so small
that the greatest hindrance to the development of a museum was a want

of money, which suggested a want of permanence. By a small grant

towards the expense of a curator, or for some similar purpose, obtainable

only while the museum remained efficient, a County Council might do
very much to render a museum permanent and efficient without diminish-

ing the interest of individual natui-alists in its development.

Dr. Brett said that, in order to bring the matter to a practical

conclusion, he would like to propose that their Secretary should write to

lS9i.                                                            »
34 REPORT-- 1894.

all the County Councils in Great Britain, urging upon them the importance

of giving aid to their own local museums.

      After some discussion, in which Dr, Brett, Sir Douglas Galton, Mr.
Gray, Sir John Evans, Mr. Gushing, and Mr. Whitaker took part, the

following resolution was proposed by Sir Douglas Galton, who remarked

that in his county it was held to be contrary to the law for a County

Council to give directly to a museum :

      ' That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that local
natural history societies, and those in charge of local museums should
place themselves in communication with the technical instruction com-
mittee of the county or borough in which they are placed with the view
of obtaining pecuniary grants towards extending technical knowledge by
means of lectures or by demonstrations in museums.'

      Dr. Brett seconded the resolution.
      Mr. Coates stated that at Perth they were building a large addition

to their museum, and had applied for aid both from the Town Council

and the County Council. They had obtained a grant from the County
Council on the condition that they should provide specimens suitable for
agricultural teaching. These specimens would be used for lectures and
demonstrations. They had been advised that they could not otherwise

obtain the grant.

     Mr. Elworthy said that a difficulty under which many of them
laboured had not yet been touched upon. They needed the services of an
expert who would visit a museum, and, for a certain fee, pronounce with

Aauthority ' this is rubbish ' in the case of worthless specimens.

Secretary who would not venture to get rid of rubbish on his own re-
sponsibility would do so at once if backed by the opinion of a dis-

interested expert.

     Sir John Evans thought that the opinion of the Secretary ought to be
deemed sufficient. In answer to a suggestion that the word ' specimens '
should be added to ' lectures and demonstrations ' in the i-esolution, he
remarked that County Council money could not be spent in acquiring

specimens.

     The Chairman then put the resolution to the meeting, and it was

unanimously adopted. He then asked if any delegates had other points

connected with museums to bring forward.
     Mr. Seward, as representing the County Borough Council of Cardiff,

was most anxious to learn, if possible, what things bought for a museum
with the view of making it more attractive and useful to the poorer

classes could be legally purchased under the Act.
     Sir John Evans replied that it seemed to him that the last resource in

these cases was the Science and Art Department at South Kensington.
If the Borough Committee wished to purchase specimens to illustrate
lectures for the advancement of technical education, the Clerk of the
Council should write to South Kensington to inquire as to the legality of
the proposed grant. If the specimens were required simply to increasn
the efficiency of the lectures, they would probably be regarded as part of
the lecture appai-atus, and the vote sanctioned.

     Mr. Gray remarked that at Belfast they always got assistance from
South Kensington in acquiring proper specimens for the museum.

     The Chairman thought that the Conference could not possibly attempt

to decide the point raised by Mr. Seward. He felt sure that they were

all most grateful to Mr. Peek for having introduced this discussion on
museums, which he believed would lead to most useful r^-sults.
                                   CORRESrONDING SOCIETIES.

                       Secoxd Conference, August 14, 1894.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Professor
R. Meldola (CLurman), Dr. Garson, Mr. Hopkinsou, Sir Rawson Rawson,
Mr. Symons, Rev. Canon Tristram, Mr. Whitaker, and Mr. T. V. Holmes

(Secretary).

     The Chairman said that with reference to the discussion at the Ligt
Conference, he hoped that those delegates who were situated in places
where there were local museums would do their best to further tlie
resolution then passed, and report progress at the Conference next year.
They had now to consider work done in connection with the various
Sections, beginning with Section A.

                                                 Section A.

  --Meteorological Photography. Mr. Clayden remarked that two years ago

he had asked to be put into communication with gentlemen willing to

photograph clouds and other meteorological phenomena. He had been put

into communication with photographers, but the number of photographs
sent had been very small. Nevertheless, an almost sufficient collection

had been received. He would, however, be grateful for photographs of
lightning showing anything abnormal. Now and then he read of the

remarkable results of a whirlwind in some district, when it was too late
for him to take steps to have the effects photographed. But if, in such

cases, the secretary of a local society would get photographs taken at once,
and send them to him, such records would be most valuable.

     Sir Rawson Rawson inquired if Mr. Clayden had the photographs of
storms and lightning recently exhibited at the Royal Society, and Mr.
Clayden replied that he thought he had a considerable number of them.

      Mr. Holgate thought that if Mr. Clayden wrote to the secretary of a
local society, the latter would always be able to obtain information as to
the existence of photographs showing the results of a whirlwind or other
abnormal occurrence. Mr. Clayden replied that he had often tried that
plan, but had usually found that the damage had been cleared away, and
that he was too late. It was therefore desii'able that the secretaries of
the local societies should arrange for photographs.

     Mr. Hembry inquired whether Mr. Clayden had received photographs

showing the results of a thunderstorm a few weeks ago in which a church had

teen struck and two men killed. Mr. Clayden replied that he had not.
     Mr. Symons remarked that much help could 1)e given by local ."societies

if they would send in reports promptly. The difficulty was that individual
members did not feel personally responsible in the matter. Everybody's
business was nobody's business.

     Remarks on the advantages to be derived from, and the means of securing
inci'eased co-operation between British Association committees and local
societies were made by Mr. Kenward, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Symons.

   --Earth Tremors. Mr. Davison said that in the last Report of the

Earth-tremors Committee there was a description of a bifilar pendulum
invented by Mr. Horace Darwin. It had been tried for a year at
Birmingham, and in consequence of experiments made there a new form of
instrument now exhibited was being constructed. Its cost would be about
36 BEPORT-- 1894.

60^. The local societies were so distributed over the country that most
places where it was desirable that one of these instruments should be

placed were within the area of one of them. Instruments placed on the

course of great lines of fault (or dislocation of the strata) would yield
results of much value.

     Mr. Horace Darwin exhibited and explained the construction and use

of the bifilar pendulum. He said it was not affected by the rapid, com-

plicated movements which took place during an earthquake, or by the

slight tremors caused by passing carts or trains. The movements which
it would measure were such as would make a factory chimney or a

vertical post fixed in the ground lean over to one side. Extremely small

movements of this kind could be measured and recorded on photo-
Agraphically prepared paper.
                              full account of the instrument was given

in ' Nature,' July 12. It is made by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument

Company.

     Mr. Symons, as Chairman of the Earth-tremors Committee, explained

how the work of the Committee had grown and in what direction they
needed additional help. In the first place, the attention of the Committee
had been directed to a solution of the question why certain vibrations

were recorded by an instrument which had been placed at the bottom of
one of the deep coal-mines of the district of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Instead

--of a straight line a series of pulsations had been obtained. They were

traced to two causes one the gradual settlement of the ground in conse-

quence of the removal of the coal, the other the beating of the waves on
the coast. They had since been looking for traces of earthquake tremors,
Mr. Davison, on one occasion, watched his instrument for some time, as he
found pulsations were taking place. These pulsations eventually turned)
out to have been produced by the earthquake then going on in Greece,
They wanted information as to the changes going on in connection with

the faults in geological strata, and, if possible, to get records of the altera-

tions in the earth's crust caused by tidal waves. When the ocean was

piled up at one part of the earth's surface it was quite possible that the

elastic surface of the earth bent slightly under it. Observations of that'

kind should be made at more than one station. The work was now-
going on at Birmingham under Mr. Davison, but they hoped that the
Association would give them a grant for a second instrument. Thev
wished to make sui-e that they were recording, not merely local phenomena,

but the great general phenomena of the earth's crust. He was glad to be

able to record that one instrument had been established at an observatory

.south of Biarritz by M. Antoine d'Abbadie, who had kindly presentee?
a duplicate instrument to the new observatory at Edinburgh. They were

anxious to see two or three instruments of this kind established in different

parts of the British Isles, and hoped that some of the wealthy friends of
the societies represented at that Conference might co-operate in findin ti-
the money for the instruments.

     Mr. Tiddeman asked whether the instrument could be placed in an
ordinary house, or whether it required a special place in a separate-

building.

     Mr, Symons replied that Mr. Davison had placed it on the cellar floor.

A separate building might be preferable, but was more expensive.

     Mr. INIills did not think the instrument would be of mnch use to

person .^1 without a special knowledge of it.
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  37

     Mr. Symons i-emarked that Mr. Darwin had undertaken to gi\e all
the necessary information, and so had Mr. Davison.

     In answer to a question from Mr. Mills, he added that it was not
essential that an instrument should be placed in a mining district, but it
was desirable that they should be scattered throughout the country.

     Mr. Seward said that he would try to get one placed in one of the
deep mines of South Wales.

     The Chairman hoped that by next year some of the Corresponding
Societies would have something to report on this question. Mr. Darwin
had kindly offered to explain, after the termination of the Conference,
the mechanical details to any persons interested.

                                                    Section B.

--I Pollution of Air in Totvns. Dr. G. H. Bailey said that for three or
   four years they had been engaged in Manchester, in connection with the
   Manchester Field Naturalists, in examining the air of towns with the
   view of ascertaining the extent to which it was polluted. This was a
  question of much practical importance, for the amount of the pollution was
   a pretty good indication of the death rate. Those times of the year at
   which the air was most polluted were those at which the death-rate was
   highest. Hitherto there had been very little attempt to ascertain the
   nature and degree of the pollution, and it had been their endeavour to
   examine the methods by which the pollution of town air could be detected,
   and to determine its nature and amount. They had almost perfected a
   method for determining the amount of sulphur compounds in the air, and
   one for measuring the amount of sunlight in towns. They had found that,
   whilst in extreme cases of pollution carbonic acid gas varied between four
   and seven parts in 10,000, the sulphur compounds varied from less than
   one up to fifty per million parts. The pollution varied practically as did
   the amount of the sulphur compounds. The work was hardly yet in so
   complete a state that he could recommend its adoption at a large number
  of other towns, but it would interest the delegates to know what had been
   done. They wei'e at that time working at a method for determining the
   nature and amount of the pollution of different districts of large towns.
   The work already done had been chronicled in the ' Journal of the
   Manchester Field Naturalists' for 1893. They had come to the conclusion
   that about 50 per cent, of the daylight was cut off by the smoke of a town,
   speaking of that form of light which could be registered, viz., the actinic
   rays. They had found that the centres of large towns sometimes showed
   a diminution, as compared with the suburbs, of about 50 per cent., the
   diminution of light in the centres of large towns as compared with the-
  open country amounting to about 75 per cent. When their methods
   were more fully perfected they hoped to have the co-operation of membei-s
   in more rural districts. They had been working at the indoor as well as

   the outdoor pollution of the air.

        Mr. Slater remarked that the plants of very smoky districts were
   either destroyed or injuriously affected by the smoke.

        The Chaii'man said that it was well known to London naturalists that
   lichens were once common on tree trunks in Epping Forest, but few
   if any were to be found there now. It is too near London for them to

    flourish,

        Mr. Symons remarked that Dr. Bailey had apparently employed the
88 REPORT-- 1894..

photographic process for measuring the amount of sunliglit, as he spoke of

the actinic rays. He (Mr. Symons) would point out that the burning

sunshine recorders showed exactly tlie same result for the other end of

the spectrum.

     The Chairman thought the matter one of the greatest importance ta
all dwellers in large towns, and Sir Rawson Rawson remarked on its
special intei'est to medical men.

     Mr. Holgate inquired whether they were to understand that the pro-
portion of sulphur in the air of a town was an indication of the amount of

its deatli-rate.

     Dr. Bailey said that he had been driven to the conclusion, that the
amount of the death-rate of a district was closely connected with the
amount of pollution in its air. While they had in Manchester, in ordi-
nary weather, a death-rate from respiratory diseases of four or five per
thousand, in foggy weather, when the air was most polluted, there was a
mortality of twenty or more per thousand from diseases of that class.

Plants suffered even more than human beings from air pollution. That part

of the work had been undertaken by Prof. Oliver, of University College,
London, who had already published a long account of the work he had
done in connection with the Royal Horticultural Society. Dr. Bailey
added that the method he had used for recording sunlight was not photo-
gi-aphic, but was that originally suggested by Mr. Angus Smith. It gave
a relative not an absolute record, .and recorded the amount not only of
sunlight but of daylight. Delegates would lind a full account of the
methods employed in the 'Journal of the Manchester Field Naturalists'"

for 189:3.

                                                  Section C.

     Mr. Whitaker (representing Section C) said that the first subject to
which he would refer was ' Coast Erosion.' The tinal report on this sub-

ject was to have been made this year, but it would, he hoped, be made

next year. After the publication of the Report the subject would be
lianded over to the Corresponding Societies, and those which have coast
borders could continue the work by recording changes on 6-inch maps,
or, still better, on 2.5-inch maps. The other subject was the ' Circulation
of Underground Waters.' The committee dealing with this matter should
have ceased to exist this year, but the final report would not appear till
next year. In this case also the local societies would be able to continue the

investigation. He took the opportunity of telling the representatives of

the Corresponding Societies that they wanted records of wells and borings,
the nature of the beds passed through, and the exact site ; also the water-
levels and the effects of pumping on them, the temperature, an analysis of
the water, and any other useful information. It was suggested that the
twenty reports of the Committee should be published, but in that case the
information about any particular district would be scattered through several
of these reports. But the Committee thought that if these reports were

arranged topographically, and possibly condensed, many local societies,

would be glad to possess the volume. He hoped the local societies would

be able to encourage the Committee in the publication of the work by
subscribing for a copy of it. It would probably foi-m a book of 250 to 30O
pages, and the cost would not exceed 10s.

      Mr. Slater said that water had been obtained from a deep well at
Malton but the Local Government Board had objected to its quality.
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  39

They were trying to adopt the remedies suggested, and when a report
was issued he would hand it to Mr. Whitaker.

     Mr. Holgate remarked that in the neighbourhood of Leeds they had
Coal- Measures, and had found a different kind of water at each level.
Tliis was the case throughout the coal-basin.

  --Erratic Blocks. Mr. Murdoch said that it seemed a pity that the

labours of the Ei-ratic Blocks Committee were confined to England and
Ireland. The work in Scotland had been by no means so completely
done as was commonly supposed.

     Mr. Gray said that in Ireland they had issued their fii-st report on

erratic blocks.

     Professor Blake wished to inform the representatives of the local
societies that, being engaged in examining the microzoa of clays, par-

ticularly of Jurassic clays, he would be much obliged if they could send

him samples of fossiliferous clays from various parts of the country. He

would be glad to report to the sender on the general character of these
clays and their microzoa. There was another matter he should like to
take the opportunity of mentioning to them. For the past three years
he had published a book ('Annals of British Geology') which contained
abstracts of the geological papers read before the local as well as the
London societies. It had not hitherto been self-supporting, though the

loss was decreasing. He had failed to get a grant from the British

Association, and could no longer afford to publish at a loss, so, though
the manuscript for the fourth volume was ready, he could not publish it

unless he received additional promises of support. As this state of things
was, in all probability, unknown to most of the local societies and their

representatives, he had taken this opportunity of mentioning it.
Mr. Whitaker trusted Mr. Blake's remarks would cause an increased

--sale to that most useful work, the ' Annals of British Geology.'
      Geological Photographs. Mr. Jeffs stated that they laad received

1,055 photographs. Some districts were totally unrejDresented, possibly
from want of photographers. The Geological Photographs Committee
had passed a resolution recommending the Council of the Biitish Asso-
ciation, whose property the collection was, to deposit it in the Museum
of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, London. As to the question of
publication, they had not yet found a publisher who would take the

matter up.

    The Rev. H. H. Winwood had found great difl&culty in getting
an amateur to photograph geological sections. Professional men Avere

sometimes worse.

                                                   Section E.

     Mr. Sowerbutts remarked that last year he had promised to give
a report of the examination in geography at the primary schools of
Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire. Every delegate had received a
copy of that report. They had come to the conclusion that geography
would never be taught satisfactorily unless it was made a compulsory
subject. It was disgraceful that geography was so badly taught, or
utterly neglected, in the schools of a country which had territory in
every part of the world. They had been pleased, however, to notice
that much progress had been made in some of the primary schools by
the institution of school museums. It was a singular fact that in
40 REPORT-- 1894.

Yorkshire the girls won all the prizes, and in Lancashire the boys. The

council of the Manchester Geographical Society thought that next time
they would test the secondary schools. His society had, for the last two
or three years, published an analysis of the chief geographical papers
which had been published in English and foreign journals, a necessary

though expensive work. He hoped that some day there would be an

international committee to deal with that matter. The report on the
Ordnance Survey was a very interesting and important one, and he hoped
the delegates would read it.

     Mr. Whitaker said that the report referred to had not reached
members of the Corresponding Societies Committee, and Mr. Sowerbutts

regretted having forgotten them.

                                              Section H.

   --Ethnographical Survey. Mr. Brabrook remarked that the delegates

had shown so much interest in this question, and so many had given
assistance, that he need only give some account of the progress made

since their last Conference. During the past year they had their list of
suitable villages considerably increased : there were now 367, a much
larger number than they had expected would be suggested as places
suitable for examination. It had taken much time to draw up the forms
of schedule, of which each delegate had received a copy, but he thought

the work well worth doing. He might mention that at Ipswich, where

they would meet next year, a sub-committee had been formed to assist

them, which had already been of much use ; while at Liverpool, where
they would meet in 1896, the keeper of the museum, Dr. Forbes, had been

kind enough to undertake that his assistant in the ethnographical

department should set to work on the lines we projjose to adopt. Many

gentlemen engaged in special observations at particular places might

obtain much assistance from the additional facts which had been collected
by Dr. Forbes. In Wales their sub-committee had met, and had formu-

lated some proposed regulations for action which the Central Committee
thought very wise, and they hoped that work would soon be begun in

"Wales on the lines indicated by Mr. Allen. In Ireland Professor Haddon
had drawn up a report of the work done there, which was of great im-
portance. In combination with Dr. C. R. Brown he had prepared a great
number of papers resembling the schedules of instructions issued by the

Central Committee. He hoped that his Honour Deemster Gill would

become interested in the matter, because they had two excellent corre-

-- --spondents in the Isle of Man already Mr. Moore and Mr. Kermode and

it appeared to him that those three gentlemen would form an admirable
sub-committee for that quarter. In Scotland they had a promise of
assistance from gentlemen representing the Glasgow Archseological Society.

He had lately presided at a congress of archaeological societies, and had

made a statement on the subject of the Ethnographical Survey. The
organisers of the congress were good enough to ask him as to the cost of
an explanatory statement which could be circulated among their own

members with their transactions. He had answered that he would be

willing to pay for the setting-up of the statement, if the various societies

would pay the cost of printing off the number of copies required. He

would be pleased to make a similar arrangement with any of the corre-
sponding societies, and would be glad to receive suggestions of any kind

from any of the delegates present. He wished to make one additional
            CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                41

remark. They had been told that their instructions with regard to photo-

graphing were too minute. But those instructions had been drawn up by

Mr. Francis Galton with reference to his system of composite photographs,

and any departure from them would make the application of that system
comparatively difficult. At the same time they did not wish to lose any

photographs which might come in useful, even if, in their case, the instruc-

tions had not been followed.

Mr. Sowerbutts stated that with regard to photogi-aphs the old people

in his district objected to be photographed and measured, apparently from

a notion that to allow it would be to render themselves subject to witch-

craft. They had found a difiBculty in providing the necessary apparatus

for their ethnographical work.

Dr. Garson wished to say that as regards the photographs it was not

Anecessary to get all the appliances Mr. Galton had mentioned.  very

simple arrangement could be made by means of three sticks set up so as

to give the exact notion of a person's height, the top of his head coming

across the transverse stick. The seat could be raised or lowered like that

of a piano-stool, so that each person sitting on it would have his head in

the same place, whatever his height might be. It was well also to have

chalk lines on the floor at right angles to each other, the sitter being

directed to look along one or the other of them. They did not want the

measurements of very old people, or indeed of persons moie than fifty

years old.

Mr. Brabrook added that, as regards the supply of apparatus, the price

of the cheaper kind of instrument for taking measurements was 11. 6s.,
but there was a better one at 3/. 3s.

Dr. Garson remarked that the one at 1/. Qs. was quite good enough.

     The Chairman said chat in his opinion they had held a very useful
Conference, and in concluding it he wished to express the hope that the

delegates would bring its proceedings under the notice of their respective

societies in as forcible and complete a way as possible. The custom of

the Essex Field Club was to ask their delegate to send in a report of
what had been done, and to publish it as soon as possible in the ' Essex

Naturalist.' He hoped other Corresponding Societies would act in a

similar manner-

   A vote of thanks to the Chairman was proposed by Mr. Symons,

seconded by Dr. Garson, and carried unanimously. The proceedings then

terminated.

     The Committee recommend the retention of all the Societies at present
on the list, with the exception of the Eoyal Geological Society of Ireland,
the Bedfordshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, and the
Liverpool Geographical Society, which have not complied with the regu-

lations.

     The Committee have pleasure in reporting that the Berwickshire
Naturalists' Club, the Glasgow Archaeological Society, and the Norfolk and
Norwich Naturalists' Society have been added to the list of Corresponding

Societies.

Report on the Present State of our Knowledge of Thermodynamics.

                                 By G. H. Bryan.

Part II. The Laws op Distribution of Energy and their Limitations.
                  With an Aj)petulix by Prof. Ludwig Boltzjiann.)

                                     (

           Introduction.

L This Report deals primarily with the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law and
Maxwell's Law of Partition of Kinetic Energy, which form the basis of

the Kinetic Theory of Gases. One of the main points kept in view has

been to show where to draw the line between dynamical systems which

do and dynamical systems which do not satisfy the laws in question.

Since the appearance of the first Report ' several papers have appeai-ed

which have thrown a somewhat different light on certain aspects of the

subject, and have thus materially assisted in crystallising our knowledge

of this branch of Thermodynamics into a definite form. In order to pre-

vent unnecessary controversy, I have, as far as possible, avoided drawing

conclusions from arguments of a vague and theoretical nature. Where,

however, results are based on purely mathematical calculations they must

be understood to be liable to modification should further examination

show the calculations to be faulty or inaccurate. It is necessary to

mention this, as one of the investigations cited in Part I. has subse-

quently been found to be incorrect, with the result of very materially

altering our \'iews on the question at issue.^

   A great advance in the present subject is due to tlie extension of the

use of generalised co-ordinates, by which greater generality has been given

to results and the analysis much simplified, as a comparison of Boltzmann's

Aearly papers with modern writings abundantly testifies.  further sim-

plification has been effected by the use of the Jacobian notation.

   -- --For convenience I have in places written exp 7iEforexp( AE) or e~''^.

     The present Report is divided into three sections. In Section I.

Maxwell's Law of Partition of Energy is regarded in the aspect of a general

dynamical theorem, without reference to any particular applications, and

without taking into account the effect of collisions. Section II. treats of

the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law for a system of bodies colliding with one

another indiscriminately, and partaking of the nature of gas molecules.

Section III. deals briefly with certain researches connecting the Boltzmann-

Maxwell Law with the Theory of Probability, the Virial Equation, and the

Second Law of Thermodynamics.

                             Section I. Non-coli-iding Systems.

                                     Clerk Maxwell's Investigations.

      2. Clerk Maxwell's investigations^ have played such a prominent part
in the literature of the Kinetic Theory that I think it desirable to
recapitulate his paper briefly, so as to show more clearly what assump-

tions he made and how much he actually proved.

      ' Cardiff Beport, 1891, pp. 85-122.

    '^ The results stated in the first tAvelve lines of Part I. Section III. § 44 are now
known to be erroneous. See also §§ 36, 37 below.

     It may be safely asserted that a large portion of our progress in the

present subject has been made, first, by showing that Maxwell's demon-
strations are faulty and unsatisfactory, and subsequently by discover-
ing fresh methods of proof, which, while leading to the same general
conclusions, show more clearly the limitations a,nd conditions under which
these conclusions hold good. In this process of destruction and recon-
struction a large amount of literature has accumulated, and I shall
endeavour in the present Pteport to unearth from the general mass the
main results to which these papers tend.

     3. Maxwell claims that his theoi-em is applicable to any dynamical

system whatever. 'The material points may act on each other at all

distances and according to any law which is consistent with the equation

of energy, and they may also be acted on by any forces external to the

system, provided these also are consistent with that law. The only

assumption which is necessary for the direct proof is that the system, if
left to itself in its actual state of motion, will sooner or later pass through

every phase which is consistent with the equation of energy.' *
     4. Instead, however, of a single system. Maxwell considers a large

number of independent dynamical systems, similar in every respect,
each defined by its n co-ordinates (g,, . . . q,,) and the corresponding
momenta71 (^^i, . . . ^J,,). Each system is capable of passing through
every phase which is consistent with the equation of energy, and it is
thus assumed that all the systems have the same energy. In the case of a
free system unacted on by external forces, the six components of linear
and angular momentum remain constant, and Maxwell assumes that these

are the same for all systems.
     5. Taking the ' action ' of the system during any period of the motion,

he employs this function to establish the determinantal relation between
the multiple differentials of the co-ordinates and momenta at the beginning
and end of any interval, and thus establishes the relation

            S(y/, . . . f.l.qx',. . · An ) _.^            ,j.

    7. He next assumes that the momenta (now denoted by a,, ... a,,)
may be so chosen as to reduce the kinetic energy to a sum of squares, or

                      T = i2Mrar^                      (4)

With this assumption, he integrates (3) with respect to the momenta, and
finds by Dirichlet's method

and that since this expression only involves k,,, therefore the law of distri-

bution of the kinetic energy is the same for all the momenta. Multiplying

--the above expression by k,,, and integrating from A;,,^0 to A;,,^T=E V,

we find that the mean value of k,, is

                            n71

the maximum value being of course equal to T, because the portions of
the kinetic energy due to the other momenta cannot be negative. Hence

Maxwell infers ' that the average kinetic energy corresponding to any one
of the variables is the same for every one of the variables of the system.'
This result is commonly called Clerk MnxiielVs Theorem.

     8. In Part II. of the paper Maxwell deals with a free system, con-
sisting of n particles not acted on by external forces. For such a system
not only tlie energy but also the velocity- components of the centre of mass

and the components of angular momentum round this point in any three

fixed directions will be constant throughout the motion. Maxwell therefore
assumes them the same for every system. Under these circumstances the ^n
momentum-components of the system are not all independent, but seven
of them can be expressed in terms of the rest by means of the seven
equations of condition, and the law of permanent distribution is expres-

--sible in terms of the multiple difierential of the Sw co-ordinates and 3w

of the velocity components of the particles. The algebra is very long
and laborious, and need not be examined in detail here. The objections
to Maxwell's investigations can be much more easily discussed and
criticised with reference to the simpler case considered in Part I., and

the law of distribution in a free system can be treated more simply by

alternative methods {vide §§ 16-18, § 45, and appendices A, B below).

    The Assumption that the System passes through every Phase consistent
                                   iviih the Equation of Energy.

     9. This assumption probably presents greater difiiculties than any
other part of the Kinetic Theory, and it is therefore advisable to com-
mence by stating under what circumstances it requires to be made
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.                                              67

     The whole of Maxwell's demonstration, and most of the investigations
of Boltzmann/ Watson,^ and other writers on the same subject, are based
on the consideration of an infinitely large number of independent systems,
similar in every respect, whose co-ordinates and momenta at any instant
are distributed according to a fixed law, and the object is to find what

this distribution must be in order that it may be independent of the

time and unafiected by the motions of the systems. I cannot see that
these investigations anywhere assume that each individual system passes

through every possible phase. At each instant there must be some

systems in every possible phase ; but a distribution would obviously be

-- --permanent and very much so indeed in which each system always

remained in the same phase, and never passed into any other phase.
     10. The assumption first confronts us when we attempt to pass from

the consideration of a large number of systems to that of a single system,
i.e., if, having investigated the result of averaging the distributions of
energy at a' given instant over the different systems, we wish to infer
similar properties for the corresponding time-averages for any one of the

systems.

     It is easy enough to suggest systems to which the assumption is
inapplicable. Most of the ' test cases ' which have been suggested as dis-
proving the law, and which will be considered later on, are instances of
such systems. Lord Eayleigh ^ has suggested as another instance an
elastic ball moving on a table having a circular boundary, at which it is
reflected. If, instead of taking a single particle. Lord Rayleigh had sup-
posed the table covered with such particles initially distributed uniformly

over its area, and projected in such a manner that at any point as many

particles were moving in one direction as in another, he would find these

same conditions satisfied at any subsequent time, and this is, to my mind,

all that Maxwell proves.
     11. It is far less easy to suggest any simple system which does satisfy

the assumption. The tracing point of a Lissajous' pendulum curve-tracer,
considered by Boltzmann,^ or in other words a particle whose equations
of motion are

x + a^x=0,                        y-\-b"-y^Q,

possesses when a, h are incommensurable the property of passing sooner

or later through every point within a certain rectangle, but it does not
possess the other necessary property of passing through any point in every

possible direction in succession. This may be easily seen for the simplest
case when a is nearly but not quite equal to b : here the path is nearly

elliptical, and there are only two possible directions at any point. Hence,
in order to satisfy the assumption, Boltzmann requires a thin elastic

cylinder to be placed perpendicularly to the plane of motion, so that the

particle may have its direction of motion changed each time it strikes and
rebounds from the cylinder. And this introduces collisions into the

problem.

To discover, if possible, a general class of- dynamical systems satisfying

the assumption would form an interesting subject for future investigation.

It is, howevei', doubtful how far Maxwell's law would be applicable to

Wethe time-averages of the energies in any such system.                     shall see, in

what follows, that the law of permanent distribution of a very large
number of systems is in many cases not unique. Where there is more

than one possible distribution it would be difficult to draw any inferences

with regard to the average distribution (taken with respect to the time)

for one system.

    Thus the proof of Maxwell's Law of Partition of Energy furnishes no

general conclusions with regard to the average distribution of energy in a

xingle conservative dynamical system with a finite number of degrees of

freedom, independently of initial circumstances, except by making as-

sumptions which are nearly tantamount to assuming the law. It may

Wereasonably be inferred that no such conclusions exist.          shall therefore

assume in future, unless otherwise stated, that we are dealing with the

distribution at any instant in a large number of systems.

   12. It is probable that the molecules of a gas in the ' special ' or equi-

librium state, in consequence of their frequent collisions, satisfy the

assumption, which Boltzmann ' has employed to give a simple proof of the-

e~''^ law of distribution. But he was careful to point out that no proof

had been given that the assumption either was satisfied or could be

satisfied by gas-molecules, and he therefore referred for an alternative

verification of his results to an independent but longer proof ^ based on a

consideration of the collisions between molecules. Similar questions are

raised by Boltzmann in his Appendix to this Report.

                     The Evahiation of the Fimctional Determinant.

     13. Watson^ has raised an objection to Maxwell's evaluation of the

functional determinant on the ground that the result takes the form

                                    d{pu . . . q,) A'

where A and A' are separately zero ; and, therefore, the investigation

leaves the value of the determinant undeterminate. This, he shows,

follows from the fact that the condition E constant supplies no independent

relation between the initial and final states.
     Both Watson'* and Lord Rayleigh* have therefore given an inde-

pendent proof based on the substitution of Hamilton's ' principal function '
S, for the ' action ' A, where

                           S = ['{T-Y)dt

     14. There is another Jacobian relation similar in form but entirely
different in meaning, of which the importance seems to have been hardly

fully appreciated, if we may judge from the absence of references to it in

most wi-itings on the Kinetic Theory. In order that the Boltzmann-

Maxwell Law may be definite, it must be independent of the choice of

variables as co-ordinates of the systems considered, and for this it is

necessary for the multiple differential

              dpidp^ . . . dp^dq^dq^ . . . dq^

specify the configuration of the system of each instant of time, provided

that Pi, ^)o, . . . p,, are the corresponding momenta.

       T/^e Most General Law of Permanent Distribution for

                                 Non-colliding Systems.

15. The possible laws of permanent distribution of the co-ordinates

and momenta among a large number of such systems may now be esta-

blished thus :

We know that for any one system the total energy is independent of

the time or

                            E= constant,

and the determinantal relation shows that the multiple differential

                            dpi dp2 . . . dq,,

is also independent of the time.

     Therefore, if the law of distribution be such that the number of
systems included within the multiple differential at any instant of time

(0 is

                            f{^)dp, . . .dq,,               . . . . (9)

where /denotes any function whatever, the same law will hold good at
any subsequent instant of time {t').

     16. The above proof depends only on the fact tliat E=constant is an
integral of the equations of motion of the system and not on any other

property peculiar to E. But the equations of motion may have other

integrals as well. In such cases (3) does not represent the most general
law of permanent distribution.

     For if the integrals in question be

                            --7ij=const. /t.j const., »tc.

then any distribution expressed by the formula

                    /(E, dq,,A,, 7^2, . . . .) djj^ . . . .  . . . (10>

will also be independent of the time, and therefore permanent.
     This is the most general form of the law of permanent distribution in

a system of non-colliding bodies. It is applicable in particular to the free

systems considered in Part II. of Maxwell's paper, where /»,, /tg · . · may

denote the velocity components of the centre of gravity, and the component
angular momenta about the centre of gravity.

     17. Again, take the case of a number of particles distributed unifornily
throughout infinite space and moving uniformly in straight lines under no
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THERMODYNAMICS.  71

forces without ever colliding with one another. If u, v, tv be the velocity
components of any particle, these are constant throughout all time, and
therefore the theorem asserts that any law of distribution of the form

                       f {u, V, lo) du dv dw dx dy dz

is permanent ; a conclusion which is obviously correct.

    /18. In Maxwell's paper is to be taken constant for one particular

value of E, and zero for all others.
     In the Kinetic Theory of Gases /is proportional to e~'"^.
     The question as to how far this law is unique has been raised by

Messrs. Watson and Burbury,' who quote Boltzmann's demonstration of
the proposition, but admit tliat there may be exceptions to its truth.
That demonstration is, however, based on a consideration of the collisions
between the molecules of a gas, and has no application to a problem like

the present, where all the systems considere4 are independent conservative
systems, and no transference of energy takes place between the bodies
of one system and those of the other. It will be considered fully in
Section II. § 42.

    E19. Since for a conservative system is always constant, there will
/always exist possible laws of permanent distribution, for which is any
Efunction of ; but the possibility of other distributions will depend on the

nature of the system and the existence of other integrals of the equations

of motion.

     20. Objections have been raised to this step in Maxwell's work by
myself ^ on the ground that the kinetic energy cannot in general be
expressed as the sum of squares of generalised momenta corresponding to
generalised co-ordinates of the system, and by Lord Kelvin ^ on the ground
that the conclusion to which it leads has no intelligible meaning. Boltz-

mann * has put the investigation into a slightly modified form which meets

the first objection, and which imposes a certain restriction on the generality
of the result. Under this limitation the result is perfectly intelligible,
and the second objection is therefore also met.

      21. Boltzmann reduces the kinetic energy to the form

but he does not assume the quantities a^ to be generalised momenta. He

calls these quantities ' niomentoids.' They are linear functions of the
generalised momenta of the system, and calling these latter ^^i, jSj, . . . ,

an assumption which is convenient but not essential, because ® can only

be a function of the generalised co-ordinates, and the investigation applies

only to systems in a gwen configuration for which these co-ordinates are
therefore constant, Boltzmann supposes with Maxwell that the energy
is the same for all the systems, and with these premises he proves that the
mean value of each of the terms

has the same value. He concludes : ' Instead of the law of Maxwell that

the mean vis viva has the same value for every co-ordinate, we now obtain

generalised momentum of one of the given 2Mrts into a generalised momentum

not belonging to that part.

   A22. Now in Appendix I have shown that for non-colliding rigid bodies

laws of permanent distribution exist in which the mean kinetic energies

due to the rotations about the three principal axes are unequal. This
test case shows, therefore, that Maxwell's result is not always true for et'er?/
possible law of distribution. The following method is shorter than

Boltzmann's and Maxwell's, and shows under what circumstances the mean
kinetic energies belonging to the momentoids may be unequal.

     Let the law of distribution be given by the formula (9),

                     f(E)dpi . . . dp,,dq^ . . . dq,,,

and wbelet ^'i, ^'2, . . . k,, linear functions of ^j,, 2^2,  2^m such that the

kinetic energy is of the form

              T=i(A,2.fA-,2+ . . . ^..2) . . . (11)

Then, since these functions are linear, the determinant

is a function of the co-ordinates g,, . . . q,^ alone, and since we are dealing

only with those systems which happen to be in a given configuration at

Vthe instant considered, ® is constant, the potential energy is constant,

and so is the nmltiple differential dq^ . . . dq,,. The mean value of ^k,.^

and this is obviously the same for all the co-ordinates /i,, thus

Also by addition

therefore each of the above mean values is one nth. of the mean value of T.
      If there exist other possible permanent distributions given by (10) for

which the function/ involves other integrals of the equations of motion
besides the energy, the argument will still hold good provided these
integrals onlij involve the co-m'dinates of the system, and not its velocities or
viomenta, because these co-ordinates are kept constant during integration.
Such integrals may, for example, depend on the equations of the paths of

the particles forming the system.

    yBut if involves any function of the momenta or velocities other than

the energy, the integral in the numerator will assume different forms for
different A-'s, and the mean values of the difi'erent squares forming the
kinetic energy will, in general, be unequal.

    I would propose that the name Maxwell's Law of Partition of

Kinetic Energy be in future applied exclusively to the statement that
if the kinetic energy of a given system be expressed as a sum of squares,
the mean values of these several squares taken over a large number of
systems distributed in a given manner are equal.

    Hence Maxwell's Law of Partition of Kinetic Energy is only true

under the conditions stated above.

       --Test Cases of the Law. Motion of a Particle in a Plane.

     23. The test cases suggested by Lord Kelvin as apparently contra-

dicting Maxwell's Law of partition will be found, on examination, to

afford a valuable confirmation of all that has been said above regarding
the restrictions to which the law is subject.

      It is rather remarkable that the motion of a particle in a plane has
been employed by Boltzmann ' to furnish an illustration of the law, and
by Lord Kelvin ^ to furnish an apparent contradiction of it, which has,
however, since been met by Boltzmann.^

     Lord Kelvin shows that it is impossible to give a general proof that for
a single particle moving in a plane the time-averages of x^ and ij'^ are equal.
This confirms what has been said in §§ 10-12 as to the impossibility of
applying Maxwell's law of partition to a single conservative dynamical
system. If, instead of a single particle. Lord Kelvin had covered the
plane with particles, and had projected them so that their co-ordinates
and velocities initially satisfied any law of distribution given by the
formula

                             / (E) dx dy dio dv,

he would have found the same law to be satisfied at any subsequent time,
and the average values of it^ and v^ to be equal.

24. To prove this, Boltzmann has given (loc, cit.) a highly artificial

and laborious verification of the Jacobian relation

where 6) is the angle the direction of motion makes with the axis of x, and 6'
its value after a time t', which Boltzmann takes to be a small interval, M.

As Boltzmann 's proof is not easy to follow, it may be interesting to obtain
the same result much more simply and without imposing restrictions on

the magnitude of the time-interval t' by considering the Jacobian

We have, keeping the initial time constant,

The first two Jacobian s evidently vanish. And by the equations of

motion

Hence x', y' are functions of x', y', and the quantities in the numerators of
the last two Jacobians are not all independent : therefore these vanish.

Therefore integrating with respect to t' :

 velocities.

           Lord Kelvin's ' Decisive Test Case .'

     26. The test case by which Lord Kelvin claims to have ' effectually
disposed of ' Maxwell's law of partition ' really confirms all that has
been said about the law in this Report. It shows the impossibility of
drawing general conclusions as to the distribution of energy in a single
system from the possible law of permanent distribution in a large number
of systems. In other words, it tells us once more that the mean value of
any portion of the energy obtained by integrating with respect to the
multiple differential of the co-ordinates and momenta is not necessarily
equal to the mean value obtained by integrating with respect to the time

for a single system.

     This test case has been criticised in a general sort of way by Mr. E. P.

Culverwell,^ and the following investigation will, I think, accord with his

views :

   A27. The equal masses and C are supposed to be separated by a

' simple vibrator ' B with which they can collide, and Lord Kelvin assumes

that in the course of a large number of collisions this vibrator will equalise

        K  p A II B          C                    L

Aand keep equal the average kinetic energies with which and C rebound

from B. C is reflected by a fixed wall at L ; but A, in addition to being

stopped by a fixed reflecting wall at K, is acted on by a repulsive force

Kfrom while it lies within a certain space, KH. Part of the energy with
Awhich  left B then becomes potential while the energy of C always

remains kinetic, and Lord Kelvin infers that the average kinetic energy

Aof is less than that of C.
Now it is not obvious that the vibrator at B will actually always
A KBequalise the average kinetic energies of rebound of and C. If
                                                                      is

much greater than BL, C will collide with B much more frequently than

A, and I should be inclined to think that without investigation no definite

relation could be assumed between the average energies of rebound of

A and C. But this is quite irrelevant to the point. Accordingly, let us

assume the vibrator to be possessed of the property in question, so that

Athe average energies of and C are equal. Let x, x' be the co-ordinates

Aof and C, u, u' their velocities, x the potential energy of A, so that x
Avanishes when is outside the region KH. Take each particle of unit

mass.

Kmarks of Mr. Culverwell already mentioned. The A's do not all reach

every time, those that are moving slowly only penetrating a small distance

into the region KH, and the depth of penetration increasing with the

Hvelocity at or B. Hence the density of distribution of the A's diminishes

as we approach K, but out of the whole number at any point the proj)or-

that the number of them whose co-ordinates and momenta lie within given

                 Applicability of the Preceding Investigations to Gases,

     3.0. Before considering in detail those investigations in which col-
lisions and encounters between the molecules of a gas are taken specially

into account, it may be well to examine briefly how far the general results

established in Section I. can be applied to the problem of the Kinetic
Theory of Gases (see also Boltzmann's Appendix, infra).

     The ' independent systems ' considered above may be chosen in several

different ways.

    We(i) may take each ' system ' to represent a single molecule of gas

moving about freely or in a field of external force. The above investi-
gations will apply so long as the molecules considered do not encounter
or collide with other molecules, and we conclude that in the absence of
such encounters any distribution determined by the expression (14) of
§ 15 will be permanent if the 2n quantities 7? , , . . . q,^ represent the
n momenta and n co-oi'dinates of a single molecule.

      This is most important. It is not sufficient in the Kinetic Theory
to investigate a law of distribution which is unaffected by collisions or
encounters any more than it is sufficient to investigate a law which is.
permanent in their absence. It is necessary to satisfy conditions of
permanence in both cases.

    We(ii) may take each ' system ' to represent a pair of molecules or a.

group of several molecules in the course of a binary or multiple encounter,
it being assumed that the intermolecular forces remain finite during
encounter, and that at each instant there are sufficient encounters of the

same kind to give rise to a law of permanent distribution among the
encountering sets of molecules. Here the quantities g,, . . . q,^ will

have to include all the co-ordinates of all the molecules in the group,
considered. Then any distribution determined by (8) will be permanent
so long as the molecules of any one group do not encounter any molecules
not in that group.

     But in a gas each molecule will encounter various molecules in suc-
cession, so that the same set of molecules cannot be considered perma-
nently as a system apart from the rest. From this we find at once that
if the frequency of distribution i is a function of the energy alone ^ it

      ' This is not the case if the mass of gas has a perceptible motion of translation
 or rotation (see § 45 and Appendix B).

must be of the well-known form

                                                                       e-"=.

For before two molecules encounter each other the frequency of
distribution of the co-ordinates and momenta of one cannot depend on

fthe co-ordinates and momenta of the other. Hence if , f^ denote

the frequencies of distribution of the two molecules just before the
encounter

                                           /iX/2=/(E).

    Now the same law must hold just before the encounter as during it,

and just before the encounter the mutual potential energy of the molecules

is zero, so that

                                   E^Ei + Ej,

where EiEj are the separate energies of the molecules ; and the resulting

relation                   ..../iX/2=/(Ei+E.)

                                                                      (20)

can only be satisfied by

     Hence before and after the encounter the molecules have their
co-ordinates and momenta distributed with frequencies proportional to
e~''^' and e~''^- i-espectively. But during an encounter the frequency of
distribution of all the co-ordinates and momenta of the pair or group is

proportional to e~''^.

    For a pair of molecules we may write the function

                          y_-g-'iT, ^g-;iT, g-;i(x,+x^+x,=)  ·  ·  ·  (21)

where xi X2 are the potential energies of the molecules due to the field,

X2          their  mutual potential energy.  This shows that for any given con-
         1
iiguraiion the momenta of the molecules denoted by the suffixes 1, 2 are

separately distributed with frequencies proportional to e"''^' and e''"'^'

respectively. The distribution of the co-ordinates of one molecule is not,

however, independent of the position of the other owing to the presence

Whenof the factor e"*"*'.  the encounter is over ^12 vanishes, so that this

factor disappears, and the distributions of the co-ordinates of the two

molecules become independent of each other.

            Similar reasoning holds good for encounters involving any number of

molecules provided that these encounters are sufficiently frequent to have

a law of distribution.

            (iii) If either the molecules act on each other at all distances, or they

cannot be divided into independent isolated groups, a ' system ' must be
--taken to represent nothing short of the whole mass of gas or other
-- Wematter under consideration.
                                             therefore require the distribution in

a single system, and this brings us face to face with the difficulties con-
sidered in §§ 10-12. Maxwell certainly contemplated the applicability of
his investigation to cases of this kind (see § 3) ; but the assumption required

for this generalisation is at variance with the inferences drawn from the

test cases of §§ 23-28, whatever may otherwise be said in its favour.

with the total time t constant is inapplicable, and, moreover, the S func-

tion used in proving it becomes discontinuous in the case of impacts.

    The difficulty can be overcome by regarding impulsive forces as the

limit of finite forces, and supposing the initial and final states separated

by  a  small  constant  interval  of  time  during  which                the  impact  occurs
                                                                                                               ;

but it is certainly highly desirable to treat the problem separately.

    32. According to Watson, the objections will be avoided if, instead of

supposing the time constant, we assume the initial and final states to be

connected by a geometrical relation between the co-ordinates which can be

expressed in the form

and that in that case the functional Jacobian

     This relation is verified by Watson for the case of a projectile in his
letter in ' Nature.' But in his ' Kinetic Theory of Gases ' ^ he derives it
from the relation (1) with t constant, so that his method applies only to

finite forces.

     If, however, in the course of an encounter between molecules, impulsive
action takes place owing to the energy-function changing discontinuously

when the geometrical relation

is satisfied, we will now show that the states before and after the impulse
are connected by the relation

     This form of the Jacobian is applicable to the hypothetic law of

molecular force, often assumed in the Kinetic Theory, where, when two

molecules (regai'ded as material points) reach a certain distance, c, their
mutual attraction becomes infinite. Their directions of motion undergo

refraction towards the line joining them at the beginning of the encounter
and away from that line at the end of the encounter, and each refraction
must be treated separately, Watson's relation (22) being used for the motion
of the molecules between the two refractions.

     33. In the case of a collision unaccompanied by loss of kinetic energy,
such as occui's between perfectly smooth elastic bodies, the Jacobian
relation between the velocities or momenta just before and just after the
collision is easily found. For Burbury has shown ' that in a system or

--pair of colliding systems with n degrees of freedom, n 1 Linear functions

collision, and one linear function E, has its sign changed. Therefore,

     The same argument could probably be extended to multiple collisions,

ing r had their signs changed, the functional determinant would be equal

a coefficient of ' frictional restitution ' equal to unity the three components

of the relative velocity of the points of contact would be reversed, so that

r have the value 3.

       Statement of the Boltzmann- Maxwell Law.

      34. It is highly desirable that some definite understanding should be
agreed on as to what precisely constitutes the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law.
I would suggest therefore

     (i) That the distribution of a large number of molecules or other
dynamical systems of the same or different kinds in which the co-ordinates
{q) and momenta (;;) of each system are so arranged that the number of
systems in the neighboui-hood of any given state is proportional to

                       e-^'^dpi . . . djjjcji . . . dq,,  .  .                   . (26)

h being the same for all the kinds of molecules or systems, be called The
Boltzmann-Maxwell Distribution.

     (ii) That the law which asserts the permanency of the Boltzmann-

Maxwell distribution in any particular case be called The Boltzmann-
Maxwell Law.

     (iii) That in future these names be not applied to any corollaries such
as that which asserts the equality of the average value of the squares
into which the kinetic energy can be split up. That corollary I have

called Maxioell's Law of Partition of Kinetic Energy.

     I trust that the adoption of these names will be of assistance in
securing that uniformity of nomenclature which is always so desirable

in all branches of science.

       --Verification for Particular Cases. Spheres and Circles.

     35. It is not necessary to consider in detail the law of distribution in

smooth colliding spheres whose centres of mass are at their centres of figure
or, what is the same thing, material particles which rebound when they
approach within a certain distance of one another. The truth of
Avogadro's law, according to which the mean translational kinetic energies

of the molecules of two mixed gases are equal, is now universally admitted.
Even Tait does not deny it, but contents himself with maintaining that
the law cannot be established without making certain assumptions, and

these assumptions are discussed at great length by Boltzmann,' who,
however, places more implicit confidence in Maxwell than is warranted

by Section T. of this Report. It seems to me that Tait's three assump-
tions,^ which are quoted in my first Report,^ actually require little beyond
the assumption that there is a law of permanent distribution. At any

rate, this is all that is necessary for showing that Avogadro's law is a

possible permanent law. The question as to how far the general law of
distribution is unique can be much better discussed in connection with

other applications (see § 45 below).

     36. The next cases are those of splieres in which the CM. is at a small
distance from the centre of figure, i.e., having a ' bias ' as in the game of

bowls, and the two-dimensional problem of circles in a plane having the
same property. Both these cases have been fully investigated by means
of long and complicated integrations by Boltzmann, ' who has also extended
his treatment to bodies of any shape, provided they are convex outwards
and have no sharp corners.

     The case of circular discs is also woi'ked out fully by Watson, ^ who,

liowever, takes the trouble of evaluating the functional determinant step
by step by expressing the final in terms of the initial velocities ; a process
which is obviated by the method of § 33 above. The frequency of col-
lisions of any kind is proportional to the relative velocity of the points of
contact in that kind of collision. It is found that the condition of

permanence will be satisfied if the number of discs whose three velocity
components lie within the multiple differential du dv do) is proportional to

whether the discs in collision are similar or belong to two different sets.
This is the Boltzmann- Maxwell Law.

     37. The case of lop-sided spheres formed the subject of a faulty

demonstration by Burnside, the result of which quoted in my first

-- --Report, § 44, third to twelfth line was in contradiction to the Boltzmann-

Maxwell Law, and is now known to be incorrect. This has been show^i
by Watson,^ by Burbury,* and also in his aforementioned paper by Boltz-
mann. The correct result is that if the velocities and anjrular velocities

Athis distribution will be unaffected by collisions. From Appendix we see

that it will also be unaffected by the free motion of the spheres between
collisions, and therefore it satisfies all the necessary conditions of perma-

nence. The mean values of Mu"^, Mv-, Mw-, Aw,-, Bw2^, Cwj^, are
equal. The other distribution of Appendix A, in which the mean kinetic
energies due to the three principal rotations are unequal, is, in general, no
longer permanent when collisions take place. In fact, Boltzmann starts
by assuming a distribution of tlie form

    Now evidently this conclusion does not necessarily hold good if each

molecule is symmetrical about the line joining its centres of inertia and of
figure, because the angular velocity about this line will be unaffected both

by collisions and by the free motion of the molecules. This angular velocity

might, therefore, follow any law of distribution wliatever, and that law

would be permanent. Neither does the conclusion hold good if the

centres of mass and of figure coincide.

The arguments of Boltzmann might have been rather more conclusive

if they had shown at lohat stage of the process these exceptional cases had

to be excluded. Burnside did worse than this, for he said : ' Hence the

three equations ' (now known to be wrong) ' are a solution ; and, there-
fore, must be the solution of the problem of the special state.'

The cases of perfectly rough spheres or circular discs having both their

normal and tangential coefficients of restitution unity furnish interesting

Weexamples for solution.  may imagine the spheres and discs covered

over with perfectly elastic fine teeth, or minute projections by whose

action the tangential components of the relative velocity ai-e reversed at

impact, and it is no longer necessary to suppose the molecules to have a

' bias ' in order to have a transference of energy between the translational

and rotational kinds.

              The Functional Equation for Colliding Bodies in General.

      38. The earliest investigation of the law of distribution for molecules
other than point-atoms (or smooth hard spheres, whose centres of mass
and figure coincide) seems to be that of Boltzmann in 1871.'

     At the present time the simplest and best treatment of the general
problem for colliding bodies with any number of degrees of freedomis that
given in Burbury's paper ' On the Collisions of Elastic Bodies.' ^ The

methods there used are perfectly general, and include Watson's proofs for
lop-sided circles and spheres as particular cases without the attendant

complications in the formuliie, which arise from writing down in full the

special forms of the various expressions assumed in those investigations.

     39. The assumptions involved in proving the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law
for colliding bodies seem to me to resolve themselves into the following :

     (i) That the law is not meaningless. The expression (26) or

                              Ne-'"^-^'(7j;, . . . dp,,dq, . . . dq,, . . (29)

must represent a definite number of molecules.
     Hence in a volume element so small that x may be considered constant

over it, there must be a very large number of molecules moving about
with all possible momenta, and out of these a large number must have
their remaining co-ordinates and momenta distributed within the corre-
sponding small multiple differential. The law will obviously not hold
at points where x, the potential of the field, becomes infinite or discon-
tinuous. Moreover, the collisions must be sufficiently frequent to admit
of a similar law being applicable to the colliding molecules.

     (ii) That any molecule has a chance of colliding with any other mole-
cule. Hence the frequency of distribution of the molecules must depend
on their actual st^e, and not on their past history or future prospects of

colliding with any particular set of other molecules. As Burbury has just

written in a letter to me : ' To take conventional elastic spheres as the

simplest case we always assume as fundamental that if (a) denotes the

A / / Bchance of sphere having velocity a, and (b) the chance of sphere
Ahaving velocity b, then the chances are always indejyendent, whether

Band collide or not.'

     (iii) The demonstration is based on the hypothesis that in the per-
manent distribution tlie collisions of any one particular kind are balanced
by an equal number of the opposite kind in which the initial and final

states are simply reversed, so that the change in distribution produced
by the former is exactly balanced by the latter. In other words, ' the
numbers of direct and reverse collisions are equal.' This is obviously a

sufficient if not a necessary condition of permanency.

    40. From this it follows that if /, F denote the frequency function of

distribution for two bodies, p^, . . . p^ and P,, . . . P,, their velocities
or momenta, and accented letters refer to the state after collision, then,

remembering that the frequency of collisions is proportional to R, the

relative velocity of the point of contact, we have

       r/=F'/                                       (30)

     This is the functional equation that must be satisfied if the distribu-

/tions determined by the functions F, are to be unaltered by collision be-

tween the two sets of bodies to which they apply, and a similar condition
must hold for collisions between bodies of the same kind. In this investi-

gation, since the forces of collision are impulsive, the co-ordinates of the

bodies are unaltered by collision, and do not enter into the multiple differen-

tials, and for the same reason /),, . . . P,, may be either generalised
momenta or generalised velocities or linear functions of them sufficient to

specify the motions of the colliding bodies.

     I think that it could be similarly proved that for collisions each involving
three bodies the functional equations would be of the form

provided, of course, that such collisions were numerous enough to have a
law of distribution.

     41. Natanson ' has deduced the functional equation (30), which in his
notation becomes

Natanson will succeed in solving the converse problem of deducing (32),

(33) from (31).

                     BoUzmann's Minimum Theorem.

     42. The property that the functional equation (30) is a necessary as
well as a sufficieiit condition of permanence was first proved byBoltzmann

for a single monatomic gas in 1872,^ for a mixture of two gases in 1886,^

and both by Lorentz and by Boltzmann for a polyatomic gas in 1887.^

   A similar investigation based on Boltzmann's was given by Bur-

bury in 1890. ' In his paper ' On the Collisions of Elastic Bodies,'

Burbury has adapted the proof to colliding systems in general, and a

similar generalisation is given in a better form by Watson.* Burbury's

specification of the states of the systems by generalised co-ordinates and

velocities, instead of momenta, is, to say the least, unfortunate, for the

complete investigation involves considerations not only of collisions, but

also of the free motions between collisions. Now, as we have seen in § 13,

the multiple difierential of the co-ordinates and m^omenta is an invariant in

such motions.  But the                                                   same  is  not  necessai'ily  true  of  the  multiple
                                                                      ,

differential of the co-ordinates and velocities ; and even if the validity of

the argument in § 13 of Burbury's paper be admitted, it only applies to

rigid bodies under no forces. Watson obviates the difficulty by the use of

generalised momenta, and arrives at the following result.

     43. Let one of the co-ordinates q^ of one of the bodies be so chosen that

Ha collision occurs whenever q,, attains its maximum value zero. Let

denote the function

    fF(log F-l)cZP, . . . ^Q,,,.|- f/(log/-l) dp, . . . dq,, . (34)

Then it is shown that

J-^(F'f-mdR 1                                                            log ^^^,dF, . . . dq,,,dp, . . . dq,,.,.q,, .  (35)

Hand the latter integral is essentially negative ; hence diminishes with
-- Hcollisions until F'f' Ff=0. Also is constant in the absence of colli-

ysions, because the conditions of permanency then require F, to be in-

dependent of the time. Moreover, the midtiple differentials c?P, . . . c?Q,,

and dp^ . . . dq,, are not affected by the choice of co-ordinates (§14 above),
and therefore no restriction is imposed on the generality of the conclusions

by choosing q,, to vanish for any particular collision under consideration,
nor does this choice affect the value of H.

the two sets. He arrives at the result

                   Is the Boltzmann-Maxwell Distribution unique ?

   We45. have now found the necessary and sufficient conditions for a

permanent or ' special ' state to be

    {!.)/, F independent of time in the absence of collisions.

     (II.) F/=^¥'f' for all collisions between two molecules.
     Under these circumstances the principle of Conservation of Energy at
once establishes the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law, which asserts that

                       F=Aexp-7iEp /=Bexp-/iE'p

always give a solution of the problem.

     Whether the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution is unique depends on

the possibility of finding other functions satisfying the above conditions,

--and it becomes necessary to discuss particular cases separately.
     Case I. When no forces act, the conservation of momentum parallel
to any line chosen as the axis of x gives for masses M, vi

                       MU + 7nu = MU' + mu'

and therefore the conditions are satisfied by

     This is the law of distribution in a gas having what Burbury calls a
* motion of simple translation ' and Boltzmann a ' progressive motion ' of
velocity iig along the axis of .r ; a result agreeing with tlaose found by
Burbury,' Boltzmann,- and others. Here the average molecular kinetic

velocity ?io) ^re equal, so that the quantity which represents tein2)erature

     Case II. When the field is symmetrical about a fixed axis, the
constancy of angular momentum about this axis leads in a similar way
to the distribution of co-ordinates and velocities among the molecules of a

--mass of rotating gas such as that forming the atmosphere of a planet.

     This case I have worked out in detail in Appendix B, and in

conformity with the nomenclature of Case I. the gas may be said to have

a motion of simple rotation.'
      It is remarkable that in the paper last referred to Boltzmann,^ while

w( rking out a number of problems on the motion of gases in a field
of force, specially considers the case in which the gas has no initial

motion of rotation. Maxwell, in the second part of the paper, discussed

above in Section I., gives a long and laborious investigation relating to a,

free system of particles with constant linear and angular momenta ; ' bub
the formulae, which are very long and complicated, do not appear to be

applicable to the present problem, since they take no account of collisions

--between the various systems.
     Case III. When each molecule has an axis of symmetry the angular

velocity Cl^ or W3 about this axis is constant and unaltered by collisions,

provided the molecules be regarded as perfectly smooth. Hence the law

of distribution is independent of O3 and W3, and these angular velocities

may be distributed according to any law. This is not inconsistent with

general conditions, for the collision formuhe Vl^'=-Vl^ and w.^=zu)^ show

that Yf-=Y'f' is satisfied by any functions whatever of W3, ^3.
     This case has already been alluded to in § 37 as furnisliing an exception

to the law obtained for lop-sided spheres. But its chief interest lies in

the fact, pointed out by Boltzmann,^ that since partition of energy only

takes place among live of its six degrees of freedom, tlie ratio of the

two specific heats  ....l+m-=l

                    +  -^  =  l-4  (39)

                       b

agreeing closely with the value found for air and most gases.
     46. Except in the above cases and the still simpler case of smooth

elastic spheres whose cm. is at the centre, it will, I think, be found
impossible to devise any form of riyld bodies in which the conditions
of permanency are satisfied for all geometrically possible collisions other-
wise than by the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution. For example, the
alternative distributions for non-colliding rigid bodies worked out in

AAppendix cannot remain permanent unless the surfaces of the bodies

are spherical, so that the line of collision always passes through their
CM. [This I have roughly verified by a process of ' exhaustion,' the
details of which are uninteresting.]

      In his aforementioned paper on the nature of gas molecules, Boltz-

mann considers the number of degrees of freedom of molecules generally

in relation to the ratio of their specific heats, and arrives at the following:
conclusion : tliat ' the entire aggregate which forms a single gas molecule,
and which can consist, not only of ponderable atoms, but also of ether
atoms bound with them, probably behaves in its progressive motion and
its collisions with other molecules neai'ly like a rigid body.'

      The case of a polyatomic molecule, whose atoms are capable of vibrating
relative to one another, affords an interesting field for investigation and
 speculation. Is the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution still unique, or do
 other permanent distributions exist in which tlie kinetic energy is unequally
 divided between the momentoids 1

     47. The important and highly interesting applications of the Kinetic
Theory to disturbed states of a gas in which, by the action of external forces,
a steady state differing from the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution is main-
tained fall outside the scope of this Report. These include the problems

of steady flow of gases, viscosity, diffusion, heat conduction, chemical

action, &:c. Such questions form the subjects of investigations by Boltz-

mann,' Tait,'^ Burbury,^ Natanson,^ and other writers too numerous to

Amention.  complete list of papers would probably require a Report to

itself, but the references in the accompanying footnotes may be of some

assistance to those specially interested in the subject.

    An48. entirely different class of problems has been treated by Lord

Rayleigh in illustration of the properties of colliding bodies in general,

considered especially with reference to the Kinetic Theory.'^ He con-

siders the law of distribution of energy in a number of large masses, each
of which is bombarded by streams of projectiles of much smaller mass

moving in both directions in a straight line. If the projectiles are all

moving with the same speed v, Lord Rayleigh finds that the velocities u

of the bombarded masses will assume the Boltzmann-Maxwell distri-

bution

                  /(zA)=Ae-^"'

where the mean kinetic energy of the masses is one half that of each pro-

jectile.

      If, however, the velocities of the projectiles themselves are distri-
buted according to the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution, the same is true

of the bombarded masses, and the mean kinetic energies of the masses
and projectiles are equal. Hence the icltole system, consisting of the pro-
jectiles and masses, satisfies the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution as
defined in § 34. Lord Rayleigh goes on to consider the case when the
free masses are replaced by pendulums under a one-sided or two-sided
bombardment, and also gives an interesting investigation of the rate of

progress towards the ' special ' state, the motion in every case being one-

dimensional.

                  Collisions replaced by Encounters.

     49. Boltzmann has pointed out " that the effect of a collision between

material points or monatomic molecules may equally well be represented

by an encounter in which only attractive forces act. When the particles

are at a certain distance apait he supposes a very great impulsive attrac-
tion to act on them, so that their directions of relative motion are refracted
very nearly into the straight line joining them. "When, after passing close
together, they again come to the same distance, they undergo a second re-
fraction under an impulsive attraction equal and opposite to the first, and the

effect of both refractions on the ultimate motion is the same as that of a
collision in which the line of centres is perpendicular to the direction of

relative motion between the two refractions. And by making the relative

velocity between the refractions very great, the duration of the encounter

may be made very small. Boltzmann points out that an encounter involving

three or more particles will sometimes have the effect of leaving two (or
more) particles permanently entangled together, and the number of such
double molecules Avill increase as the temperature and volume are decreased,
thus suggesting an explanation of the phenomena of dissociation and lique-

faction.

      In the case of polyatomic molecules specified by generalised co-ordinates,
the collision foi-mula of § 33 cannot be directly applied to an encounter of
this kind, owing to the changes of position of the molecules between the
two refractions. But there would be no difficulty in here proving the

Boltzmann-lNIaxwell Law by taking separate account of the two refractions

and the free motion between them as explained in § 32.
     50. The effect of double, treble, and multiple encounters in relation to

the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law has been investigated by Natanson.' He

arrives at conclusions entirely in accordance with what has been said
above in § 30, and shows that the translational velocities of the c.m.'s of
two or more molecules during an encounter follow the Boltzmann-Maxwell
distribution. This may be readily verified as follows.

     If the frequencies of distribution among two sets of molecules of
masses 7n^, m^ are proportional to

e-MT,+x,)     and  6-'"^^+''-'

then, as in § 30, the fi'equency of distribution of pairs of such molecules in

the course of an encounter is proportional to  (40)

           .....g-;.(T,+Tj+x,+x,+x,a)

where x,, is the mutual potential energy due to the encountei", so that Xi2

vanishes when the molecules are beyond the range of their mutual influence.

    Now let 7t,,v,,Tf,, U2,Vo,w.2 be the translational velocities of the mole-

cules, u, V, w those of their cm., ?6,., thei',., tv,. components of relative velocity.

Then from

we have total kinetic energy of translation of two molecules parallel to x

*'         -       ' -m,+TO2

·whence it readily follows from (40) that the mean energy of translation of
the whole mass m, -Fmg collected at the cm. is equal to 3/'2h, and is equal

to the mean translational energy of either of the separate molecules. And

by combining the translational energy of the pair with that of a third
molecule the result can be extended to any number of molecules.

    myIn first Report, § 43, I alluded to some difiiculties i-aised by Tait

regarding the question of temperature, but the present conclusions show

that no such difficulties arise in connection with the Boltzmann-Maxwell

    ' ' Ueber die kinetische Theorie unvoUkommener Gase,' Annalen der Phi/sik und.

Law at any rate. For, taking 3/2A as the measure of the temperature,
we see that it is

      (i) The mean kinetic energy of translation per^Vee molecule,
     (ii) The mean kinetic energy of translation of the molecules in an

                 encounter for any given configuration of the system,
    (iii) The mean kinetic energy of the cm. of two or more encountering

                 molecules found by supposing their whole mass concentrated
                 at this CM.

 If the volume of the gas be increased, the number of encountering mole-
cules will be decreased, but their mean kinetic energy will still be equal

 to that of the free molecules.

     51. The proof of the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law thus presents little

difficulty when collisions are replaced by encounters lasting only a limited

 time, so that the molecules are sometimes free and sometimes in the
 process of an encounter, even though these encounters be multiple. But

it fails when the molecules act on one another at all distances, because we

cannot then consider any group of molecules apart from the rest. More-

 over, unless collisions or encounters take place to a certain extent indis-

criminately between molecules, the frequency of distribution for any

particular molecule may depend on other circumstances besides its actual
state, and the assumptions made in proving the equation F/=F'/' (§ 39)
are no longer necessarily true. Hence, none of the above arguments now

afford any evidence that in such cases the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribu-

tion is the distribution which a gas naturally tends to assume, even though

the possibility of such a distribution may not be capable of disproof.

      Thus, in the test case of molecules attracting one another according to
the law of the direct distance, they will if initially arranged according

to the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law remain so distributed ; but this law of
permanent distribution is not unique, nor is there any tendency among

the molecules to attain this law.

      In dealing with such forces as that due to gravitation, as in the case
of a gaseous nebula held together by the attraction of its parts, it is clear
that the attraction of the more distant portions of the gas can be repre-
sented by a field of external force whose potential is the gravitation
potential of the mass. Thus no difficulty will be introduced into the proof

of the Boltzmami-Maxwell Law, except when we come to take account of

the attractions of those molecules that are very near any given molecule.
Theseare probably feeble, except in an encounter. The problem, however,

requires fuller treatment than can be given in the space of this Report.

     52. The application of the Theory of Probability to the determination
of the law of distribution among gas-molecules forms the subject of several
very interesting and suggestive papers in the hands of Boltzmann and
Burbury.

accounts, as, personally, I think they make the matter clearer. They are

not Boltzmann's.

     In his first paper ' Boltzmann starts by taking a finite number n

of molecules, and supposing that the kinetic energy of each molecule must
have one or other of a discrete series of values «, 2f, 3f, . . . ^je. Taking

the total energy T of the system as equal to \f, he investigates the

probability that it should be divided between the molecules in a given
manner, each value of the energy being a priori equally probable for a
given molecule. If wq, w,, w^, . . . w^, be the numbers of molecules having
energies 0, e, 2e, . . . j)e, the number of permutations of molecules satis-

     The cl jMsteriori most probable distribution is that for which the number

Mof permutations is greatest. Taking to be the logarithm of the denomi-

Passing to the case in which the energy is capable of continuous

variation, if/(.x) dx denote the number of molecules with energy between

X and x + dx, we have to put wq=i/ (0), w,=£/(f), . . . w^=itf {pt), and

to make t=-dx in the limit, so that the problem reduces to finding the

    This, therefore, is the a j^osteriori most probable distribution of the

energy among the molecules on the hypothesis that the a p)riori pro-

mbabilities of all energies are equal for any one molecule. If  is the

mass of a molecule, the most probable number of molecules with speeds

between u and u + du is

                           Ce-''"""= mudu                       (.51)

     This is the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution of speed for a system of
monatomic molecules moving in one plane.

     53. To obtain the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution for molecules
moving in three dimensions, Boltzmann finds it necessary to make a

different assumption with regard to the «;;riori probabilities. He assumes,

in fact, that if u, v, to be the velocities along the axes of co-ordinates, all

wvalues of u, v, are a priori equally probable. The problem of deter-

mining the a ])osteriori most probable distribution therefore reduces to

finding the minimum of

     For the general case of molecules with r degrees of freedom in a field

of force, he assumes that all values of the co-ordinates and momenta p are
« priori equally probable.

     This is the assumption that would be fulfilled if the values were
selected by drawings from an urn containing tickets, each ticket having a
set of values of ;j, . . . q,. inscribed on it, and the number of tickets in
which these values lie between the limits dp^ . . . dq^ being measured by
the product of the multiple differential dp^ . . . dq, into a constant. In
the case of a mixture of gases there would have to be a number of urns
equal to the number of gases, and the number of tickets drawn from each
urn would have to equal the number of molecules of the gas in question in
the mixture.

     The final result is that the a 2>osteriori most probable distribution is
that for which the function

is a minimum, 2 referring to the different kinds of moleiules in a mixture

of several gases.

--HThe expx-ession  differs by a constant from JBoltzmann's Minimum

Ftinction.

We have seen in § 43 that, when there are collisions between the

molecules, this function always tends to a minimum until the Boltzmann-

Maxwell distribution is attained, and the present investigation therefore

shows that the gas tends to pass from distributions of lesser probability

--to distributions of greater probability, until it attains the most probable

distribution of all namely, the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution.

Finally, Boltzmann proves that the function ii is proportional to the

entropy (plus a constant), thus affording a verification of the theorem that

the entropy of a system tends to a minimum. The identification of Boltz-

mann's minimum function with the entropy is estabHshed more briefly by

Burbury in his recent paper, to be discussed shortly.'
     54. The particular assumption as to the law of a jjriori probability

precludes the above investigations from furnishing a complete proof of
the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law. In a subsequent paper ^ Boltzmann has
removed this restriction, and has considered the a posteriori probabilities
corresponding to any assumed law of a jmori probability. In other

words, we start with a large number (N) of molecules having a given
distribution of energy, and from them a smaller number {n) are selected,
and their mean energy is found to have a certain value which may be
either the same or diiferent from that of the original N. It is required to
find the most probable law of distribution in the n selected molecules, or,
generally, the probability of any given distribution.

     Boltzmann first considers the case where the original molecules follow

the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law for two dimensional space, and points out the

necessary modifications for space of three dimensions. In the general

case, supposing /j, /a, · · . fp to denote the a priori probabilities of a
molecule having energies f, 2f, . . . pe, the a j)osteriori probability of a
combination in which the numbers of molecules having these energies are

ojq, ojj, . . . Wp respectively is proportional to O, where

The approximate expression for w ! now gives

and Boltzmann finds the following results.
     If the mean energy of the selected n molecules is equal to the mean

energy of the original N, the most probable distribution of energy in the
latter is identical with the distribution in the former.

     If, however, the mean energy of the smaller number is unequal to that
of the larger, the most probable distribution is that given by the form

     Boltzmann's investigation was probahly an attempt to arrive at the
Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution as the ultimate result of a immber of
successive processes such as the above, independently of the initial dis-
tribution. This has recently been actually accomplished by Burbury by
the application of a different method as follows :

     55. Burbury ^ bases his investigation on a generalisation of the theory
of Least Squares, which asserts that if we regard the variations of a series

of n quantities a;,, ajj) · · · ^n ^s being each the result of an infinite number

where S is a certain homogeneous quadratic function of Tthe c's, and a,

constant. This result, which for a single variable leads to the well-known
error-law, is independent of the original law of distribution of the inci-e-
raents, provided that positive and negative values of these increments are

equally probable.

     Taking S as proportional to the kinetic energy of a system, and sup-
posing the number of such systems to be very gi-eat, Burbury next sliows
that if a redisti'ibution of S among the systems is effected in a certain
way, the ultimate result will be the Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution, and
this will remain unaffected by any further redistribution. The method of
redistribution is such that energy is conserved in the final result, but not
in the intermediate processes, and Burbury suggests that the process of

redistribution of energy between the molecules may be effected by waves

transmitted through the ether. The proof requires us to assume that these
waves satisfy the principle of superposition, otherwise the law cannot be
permanent. The author, however, claims that the method is applicable to
systems in which no group of molecules is ever free from the action of
other parts of the system, and for which those proofs of the Boltzmann-

Maxwell Law treated in Sections I., II. of this Report fail.
     Burbury then finds the expression for Boltzmann's minimum function,

and calling this B he verifies that the entropy of the system is equal
--to 2B/tc (plus a constant). The whole ti'eatment is very powerful

and suggestive, and the paper opens up a wide field for discussion and

speculation.

     56. The assumption in the first place that each molecule is capable of
assuming only a discrete instead of a continuous series of different states,
the number of these states being made infinite in the limit, forms the basis

of Boltzmann's proof of his Minimum Theorem for polyatomic gas-mole-
cules.' Natanson,^ taking Boltzmann's starting-point of a number of

systems whose energies can only have one of a series of discrete values

and employing equations (43) (44) above, has worked out the final dis-
tribution of energy among the molecules on the supposition that inter-
change of energy takes place by collisions, and he has also determined
the rate at which the system approaches the Boltzmann-Maxwell

distribution. He gives a complete solution of the problem for the

particular case where ;J=3, and shows that only analytical difiiculties
prevent the method from being applied to higher values of p. When,
however, p is made infinite, the results agree with those found by Boltz-

mann and by Tait (§ 44).

The Connection between the Virial Equation, the Second Law, and the
                                 Boltzmannr Maxwell Law.

     57. The virial equation cannot be used to jyrove the Second Law.

When applied to a perfect gas it leads to the equation

pv=nO                                          (59)

From this equation, combined with the Second Law, certain properties of
pei'fect gases, with which we are all familiar, are deduced in treatises on

thermodynamics. These are that the latent heat of expansion is equal to

the pressure, that the difference of specific heats is equal to R, and so on.

Hence corresponding conditions must hold good in molecular thermo-

dynamics in order that the Second Law may be consistent with the virial

equation.

   A general condition under which the Second Law is true was originally

found by R. C. Nichols,^ and has recently been put into a somewhat

Udifferent form by Burbury.- If ^ or denote the potential energy, this

condition may be written

T\dv^-dv)-~dtdv                                (GO)

where the bar denotes average values.
     Burbury ·* has rightly pointed out that the methods of Clausius and

Szily · require such a condition to be satisfied in order that they may give
the Second Law. The condition comes in when we try to assign a mean-

ing to the ' quasi-period i,' without which meaning the result is unin-
telligible. Burbury shows that if we assume

i=i;*T'- (i.e., a definite time),

tlien x must be a function of v only, so that

^X=^X                                          (Gi)

dv dv

and this is a special case of Nichols' condition.
     It is also to be observed that in the Clausius-Szily method the

averages are time-averages. This, if not an objection, is at least a

disadvantage, since it does not show the relation between the Second

Law and the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law, in which averages are taken over a

large number of molecules in a ' special state ' of permanent distribution.
      58. That relation forms the subject of a very recent paper by Burbury,''

which is a development of his second letter to ' Nature.' ^

     The proof of the Second Law on the assumption of the Boltzmann-
Maxwell Law has long been known, and was given by Boltzmann as early

as 1871/ and by Burbury in 1876.^^ Burbury now treats the converse

problem of determining the law of distribution from the Second Law.

He finds that if the law of distribution of the co-ordinates x^yX^, . . . x-,, be

given by the expression

      N/(x,,a;2, . . . x,^)dxi . . . dx,^ or Jif/du,

and if the law of distribution of co-ordinates and velocities be given by
                            Fda dff' where diy' :=dii . . . d'e^,

then 8Q/T will be a complete diflferential if either                 . (62)

      fBurbury says : ' And since F and must vanish for all infinite values

whei'e X is some positive numerical quantity.  .  .       '
                                                     .

      Now59. this is obviously a solution, but it is not the only solution,

and I think the real inferences are slightly different from those he has

drawn. They are sufficiently interesting to be treated in detail, and they

are intimately connected with another point which at first suggests an

objection to the proof, namely, that c^t drr' is the multiple differential

of the co-ordinates and velocities, and is therefore not in general an
invariant like the multiple differential of the co-ordinates and momenta.

     In § 1 5 of his paper Burbury states that this does not matter. ' If
they' (i.e., da and da') 'do vary, that is, in effect, if the limits of integra-

tion vary, the assumption F=i^ [(U-fr)/Tj will still make 3Q/T acomplete

differential.'

    Now if 2/i, . . . 2/,, denote the generalised momenta con-esponding to

the co-ordinates a;, . . . x,,, the Jacobian

      ( ^1, ·  · ^n )                    j(^^ X2 . . . x,,) suppose

      8(2/1, . · · 2/«)

will in general be a function of the co-ordinates cc,, . . . x,,, and its form,

will depend on the choice of co-ordinates.

     Hence, if Burbury's proof be correct, we have really shown that the-
Second Law will be satisfied if the distribution be determined by any

expression of the form

      ^/-^jj(x-,, . . . x^)dxi . . . dx^dyi . . . dy^                , (64)

where by suitable choice of co-ordinates the form of J may be varied
quite arbitrarily. And by § 22 this expression represents, not necessarily

the Boltzmann- Maxwell distribution, but a distribution satisfying the

condition that if the kinetic energy be reduced to a sum of n squares,
the mean values of these squares are equal. Hence the conclusion may

be stated thus :

     If the necessity for making 8Q 'T a complete differential can be

established as a substantive law by independent evidence, the investiga-
tion affords an independent proof of Maxwell's law of j)artition of kinetic
energy between the momentoids for such a system.

                                              Conclusion.

60. The conclusions arrived at in the present Report are to be regarded

as superseding the statement of Clerk Maxwell's Theorem in §40 and the

mygreater part of §§ 41, 42, 4 3 of Section III. of                first Report.     The rest

of that Report is not, so far as it goes, materially affected by any results

now established, although several important questions connected with the
Boltzmann-Maxwell Law have now received a definite answer.

The proof of the law and the assumptions involved in it are fairly satis-

factory for gases whose molecules collide with each other to a certain

extent at random, but in a medium in which the molecules never escape

from each other's influence the subject still presents very great difficulties.

Even should it be shown that the law cannot be disproved for such a

medium, there still remains the question as to whether the distribution is

the unique one satisfying the conditions of permanence. The general

question of uniqueness, even in souie of the cases where the law admits of

more or less satisfactory proof, still suggests some questions for investiga-

tion. Intimately connected with this is the difficult question of stability.

For example, when a gas is condensed, its density at any point at first

remains proportional to e~'"- in accordance with the Boltzmann-Maxwell

Law                    but  when  a  certain  stage  is  reached,  instability sets  in, and part
                    ;

of the gas liquefies. If the Second Law be true, the new distribution

satisfies Maxwell's law of partition of energy. Does it likewise satisfy

the Boltzmann-Maxwell Law ?

The connection with the Theory of Probability still suggests subjects

for research. The relations of electrical and optical phenomena to the

Kinetic Theory open up an almost unexplored field.

collecting materials for this Report. I am particularly indebted to

Dr. Ludwig Boltzmann for his kindness in sending me copies of nearly all

his writings, and for several valuable suggestions that have helped to

Myclear up difficulties in the work.                     thanks are also due to Mr. Burbury,

Dr. Ladislaus Natanson, Professor Sydney Young, and others for similar

help, which has very materially lightened the work of consulting and

examining the large mass of existing literature relating to this most

interesting branch of Mathematical Physics.

On the Laiv of Molecular Distribution in the Atmospliere of a

                                     Rotating Planet.

     Suppose a mass of gas-molecules to be situated in a field of force that

--is symmetrical about a fixed axis for example, the field due to the

attraction of a spheroidal planet.

     Let this axis be chosen as the axis of and,;:;;, in the first place, let the

molecules be monatomic, so that they may be regarded as smooth homo-

geneous spheres or material points.

   MLet m, be the masses of two molecules, E,,, Ejj their total energies,

  P their angular momenta about the axis of z, so that

J),

p=m{vx-uy)                          P=M(VX-UY) . . (72)

Then, since the field is symmetrical, the angular momenta p, P are constant

in the absence of collisions, and at a collision the total angular momentum

is unaltered, so that

                       p^-V=p' + V'

     Also similar relations are satisfied by the energies E,,, Eji-
     Therefore, if the distributions of co-ordinates and velocities be given

-by the expressions

the conditions of permanence between collisions, and the functional equation

are satisfied by                    F=N exp -(/iEu-itP)

     Take axes of ^, v, K rotating about the axis of ;:; with angular velocity I?
and instantaneously coinciding with the axes of x, y, z.

     Then the relative velocities of a molecule referred to these moving

axes are

                     l=u + Qy,  --17= V fix,     ^=tv

and we at once find

                             9 (u, V, w)

Hence the distribution may be written

  neK^-h{km{i? + ii' + ^)-irX-h'^^\-- + ^'')] ·'i-'^nd^didi^dt . (74)

     Therefore the velocities relative to the moving axes follow the Boltz-

mann-Maxwell distribution, and in addition to this the molecules have a

superposed motion of rigid-body-rotation with angular velocity fi. And

the density at any point is the same as if the gas were acted on by ' centri-

+fugal force 'having a potential --\p'^{^^ r)^), and the reversed angular
--velocity fi were applied to every molecule.

    Hence the Kinetic Theory may he applied to the atmospheres of planets by
reducing the jylanets to rest and applying centrifugal force to the atmospheres

in the usual way.

     It is interesting to notice that the temperature 3/27i is the mean

     The results can evidently be generalised for the case when the mole-

cules are rigid bodies of any kind. Let u,, o),,, w. be the angular velocities
of such a molecule about axes through its cm. parallel to the axes of
a-., y, z, and let wi, w,, i.'a be its angular velocities about its principal axes.

where  T,. is the kinetic energy of the relative motion

       X is the potential energy due to the field ;

       Vq is the potential energy due to centrifugal force.

    Hence, as before, the Boltzmann- Maxwell Law holds for the system

--obtained by applying the reversed angular velocity fiand the centrifugal

-- +force whose potential is ^fi- (aS^ y^) at every point of the gas.

     It would not be difficult to extend the proof to the case of a rotating
ellipsoidal planet with three unequal axes, where the field of force is not
symmetrical about the axes of rotation, but the investigation would
hardly be sufficiently interesting to be worth giving in detail. It will also
be admitted, without difficulty, that similar conclusions must hold good

when the planet and atmosphere besides rotating have a common motion

of simple translation.

     In a communication read at the Nottingham meeting of the Associa-
tion ' I worked out certain results of applying the Boltzmann- Maxwell

Law to the atmospheres of planets ; but in these calculations no account
was taken of axial rotation, as I did not at that time see how the effect of

tliis rotation could be determined. The numerical results there obtained

hold good, without modification, at points alone/ the polar axes of the

various bodies considered. The effects of centrifugal force on the dis-
tributions now furnish a promising subject for future investigation, about
which I hope to say more shortly.

We shall consider a gas whose molecules are compound (or poly-

atomic), but are all similarly constituted. Let a, b, c, . . . be the co-or-

dinates which determine the position and configuration of a molecule of

such a gas ; and let p, q, r, . . . be the corresponding momenta. Let us
suppose that the time during which any one molecule acts upon or is acted

upon by other molecules is short in comparison with the whole time of its

motion. Let the gas be contained in a vessel of invariable form. After

a certain time the state of the gas will become stationary, aiid the ques-

tion is, what is then the probability that the co-ordinates and momenta of

any one molecule lie between certain limits 1 To express the probability

the second <,, the beginning of the third t^, &c. ; the end of the last of the

of length 5 begin. Denote the end of the first part after t,, by <,,+i ; the

end of the next following part t,,^.^, Ac. Assume for a moment that we

liave n separate vessels, all exactly similar to the one containing                    the  gas
                                                                                                          ;

that each of these n vessels contains the same gas, and that the motion of

the gas is the same in each. The beginning, however, is different. For

example, let the gas in the second vessel at time zero be in the same con-

dition in which the gas of the first vessel is at the time t^ ; in the third

vessel let the gas at the time zero be in exactly the same condition as it is

Wein the first vessel at the time <.,) a,nd so on.              have now in the dift'erent

vessels all the different states of the gas existing simultaneously which in

the first vessel exist successively during the whole time interval 0.

The probability div that the co-ordinates and momenta of a molecule

may lie between the limits

      + + +a and a da, b and b pdb . . . j) a-nd -\- dp, q and q dq ... . (1)

can be defined in two ways. If we consider a single vessel containing gas,

we must observe it for a long time © ; if r be the fraction of the time

during which the co-ordinates and momenta of a molecule lie between the

-- --limits (1) which we shall call the condition (1) then r/©is the probability

required. The limits (1) differ only infinitesimally from one another. No

two molecules of the same gas can be in the condition (1) at the same

time. On the other hand, if we consider the above series of n vessels at

any single instant of time, we can define the probability dw to be dz/71, where

dz is the number of vessels in which a molecule is in the condition (1).

Evidently dio will have different values for different values of the co-ordi-

nates and momenta. It will also be proportional to the differentials

                      n

To find the condition for a stationary state we may consider one gas

.at successive instants, or the series of vessels at one instant. In the

first case the values of dw for the stationary state will be the same,

whether we consider the gas from time to time t,,, or from time ty to

time  <,,_,_i,  or in genei'al  from  tot,; <,,+,..       Evidently the converse is true
                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

that is, if dw has the same values for all these cases, the state is

stationary. By the second method we must remember that at the time

we have in our n vessels all the states which appear in the first case from

time to time <,, ; at the time <, we have in these vessels all the states

which appear in the first case from /;, to <,,+i. . . . The above statement,
thatr/0 has the same values in all cases, whether we consider the time

from zero to t,,, or from <, to <,,+i, or from t,. to ^,,+j, becomes in this second
case identical with the statement that dzjn has the same value, whether

we consider the n vessels at time zero, or time <|, or time <2) *^c. That

is, since the difference between <, and zero, t.2 and <, . . . can be made

infinitely small, the above statement amounts to saying that for the

Westationary state dzjn has the same values at all times.                        shall next prove

that dzjn has this property under the following conditions :

   We define a free molecule to be one which is not acted upon by any

other molecule. For each free molecule let the values of _/' {a,b . . . 2^, q · . ·)

of molecules : --

    (i) Molecules which are free at the beginning and at the end, and during

the whole time t. For any of these molecules let the co-ordinates and

momenta lie at the time between

    AandA + c?A, BandB + cm, . . . P and P + (ZP, Q and Q -f- dQ ... (8)

and at the time t between

    Let G and g represent the energy of such a molecule at the times

and t respectively ; G, g being equal. According to equation (3) the number
of vessels in which at the time the co-ordinates and momenta of a
molecule lie between the limits (8) is «He~''^c?A o?B, . . . dP cZQ. . . . But,
by hypothesis, the co-ordinates and momenta of these same molecules lie

between the limits (9) at the time t ; hence the above expression gives
also the number l^ of vessels in which, at the time t, co-ordinates and

momenta of a molecule lie between the limits (9). But we have Gr^g,

Therefore the number ^ is equal to

     nKe-'-sdadb . . .dpdq...

But this last expression gives at the time the number of vessels for

which the co-ordinates and momenta of a molecule lie between the limits
We(9) (according to formula 3).
                                    see that this number remains con-

stant during the time t ; and since the same is true for all values of a,

b, . . . p, q, . . . the theorem holds good for all molecules of the first kind,

     We(ii) call all those molecules ' molecules of the second kind' which are

free at the time 0, but which are in process of encounter at the time t.

For a pair of such molecules let the co-ordinates and momenta lie at the

time between the limits

and  A, andA,-l-<^A,,B, andBi-t-^B, . . . P, and P, +<^P|, Q, and Q, -l-^Q, . . . "I         ,,p^,

respectively. Because these molecules were free at the time 0, the
number of vessels in which at time a pair of molecules fulfils the

condition (10) is, according to formula (5),

     nHV^'«'-«"'c^AirfB, . . . d^.dq, . . . dA^dBo . . . dP.,dQ., . . .

     Gi and G.2 are the energies of the molecules at the time 0. But the
above-mentioned vessels are identical with the vessels for which at the
time t a. pair of molecules fulfil the conditions (11). The number of the
last kind of vessels is therefore also given by the above expression. It is

easily seen that this expression is equal to

                  nlPe~''^da^dbi . . . dp^dqi . . . da.^db^ . . . dp^dq.^ . . .

/where is the whole energy of the two molecules at time t. Compari-

son with formula (7) shows that the last formula gives also the number of
vessels in which at time a pair of molecules fulfilled the condition

(11). Therefore the theorem also holds good for the molecules of the
second kind.

     (iii) Molecules which are in process of encounter at time 0, but are
free at time t

                                                   ;

     (iv) Molecules which are free at times and t, but which have been
encountered by another molecule between these two instants of time.

     It is easily seen that our theorem can be proved in the same way as

before for every pair of molecules of the third or fourth kind.

    To calculate the mean vis viva T of a molecule we put

               +Xi=kiip+ki2q+ . . ., x.2=k2iP ko2q · . ., &c.

The coefficients k may be chosen to be functions of the co-ordinates such

that T acquires the form h {)n^x^^ + 1n^x/+ . . . m^x/), where/ is the

the value 1/2A for the average value of each term of the form \infl^^.

Very little has been done with Balfour Stewart's actinometer during the

past year. It will be remembered that in the last Report it was stated
that an attempt had been made to replace the thermometer by a thermo-
couple of copper and iron. From the preliminary experiments it appears
that this arrangement is extremely sensitive, and using the instrument
as a dynamical actinometer, in which the rate of change of temperature

is recorded, a complete observation may be made in from two to three
minutes. It was mentioned last year that a DArsonval galvanometer
had been tried ; the Committee have now purchased an Ayrton-Mather
galvanometer specially wound for thermo-electric currents : this instru-

ment has been examined Ijy Professor Ayrton, and to him and his pupil,
Mr. Arnold Philip, the Committee are indebted for much useful informa-
cion. The instrument is not yet in a very satisfactory condition, for, in
order to make it sufficiently sensitive, the suspending wire has to be
unusually line, and it takes a pei-manent set, which causes an alteration of
zero. Endeavours are being made to overcome this inconvenience. The
thermocouple of copper and iron does not give currents quite proportional
to the difference of temperature, and it might be preferable to replace the
iron by some other metal or alloy. Copper is, of course, one of the
essential metals, and it appears difficult to find any other material to
replace the iron which will give proportional currents of sufficient strength

to be useful.

     The Committee ask for reappointment and for the unexpended portion

of the grant.

The Committee were appointed for the purpose of investigating the rate
of increase of underground temperature downwards in various localities of

dry land and under water.
     The nineteenth Report contained the results of observations taken in.

1891 by Mr. Hallock, of the Smithsonian Institution, at depths extend-
ing to 4,402 feet in a nearly dry well at Wheeling, Virginia.

    Mr. Hallock, who now dates from Columbia College, New York, has

recently furnished the Secretary with printed copies of a paper, contributed

by him to the American Association for the Advancement of Science last
year, containing further observations iu the well, made at the expense of

the U.S. Geological Survey.

    When the observations of 1891 were finished, an oak plug was driven

into the top of the casing to protect the hole. In July 1893 the plug was
withdrawn, and the well, instead of being dry as before, was found to be

full of fresh water to within 40 feet of the top. This water is believed to

--have leaked in at the lower end of the innermost casing that is, at

1,570 feet below the surface.

    By means of inverted Negretti maximum thermometers, protected

against pressure by sealing them in stout glass tubes, careful observations
were taken at various depths from 1,586 feet to 3,196 feet, two thermo-
meters being employed to check one another at each depth. The results
were practically identical with those obtained two years previously, when
the well was full of air, the greatest certain difference being only one-fifth

of a degree. An obstruction at 3,200 feet prevented observation at

greater depths ; but this obstruction will probably be removed, the well

pumped dry, and the drilling continued.
     In making the observations, four thermometers were lowered at a time,

two of them being in an iroii bucket 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter
at the end of tlie wire, and the other two in an open wire frame 260 feet
from the end of the wire, the diameter of the bore being just under

5 inches.

     The temperatures at 103 feet, 206 feet, and 300 feet were also observed
with suitable thermometers, the temperature at 103 feet being 52°'53,
which is 1°'2 higher than the true temperature of the soil at that depth,
as determined by other observations in the immediate neighbourhood.

     The smallness of the disturbance of temperature by convective circu-
lation in this well, both when dry and when filled with water, is very
remarkable, and renders the well specially suitable for determinations of
the increase of temperature downwards.

     The Committee have to record with deep regret the loss of their
valuable member, Mr. Pengelly.

The Committee were appointed as in former years for the purpose of co-

operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making observations
on Ben Nevis at the two observatories situated respectively at the top and
bottom of the mountain.

     During the year the hourly eye observations by night and by day

have been uninterruptedly made by Mr. Omond and his assistants ; and

the continuous registrations and other observations have been carried on

at the Low Level Observatory at fort William with a like fulness of

detail as in previous years.

     Owing to frequent storms and heavy snowfalls, which lay long and
deep, the climatic conditions at the top of the mountain were very severe

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

hut the Directors have the greatest satisfaction in reporting that the
health of the observers has notwithstanding been good. The Directors
tender their best thanks to Messrs. Charles Stewart, B.Sc, Craig, Shand,
Herbertson, and Rankin.

continuance of anti-cyclonic weather during the time when, as lias been
often referred to in our Reports to the British Association, the tempe-

rature at the top is frequently much higher, absolutely, than it is at

Fort William.

     The lowest mean monthly temperature at Fort William was 37°"6, for
January, and at the top 23^'2 in the same month, these being respectively
1°*7 and 1°*5 under the average of the month. The warmest month was
August at both stations, where the means were 59° -5 and 43° "6, or 2°'5 and

4°'l in excess of their averages.

     The maximum temperature at the top was 62°-6 on June 18, and at
Fort William 83°-2 on August 9. The minimum at tlie top was 6°-4 on
January 2, and at Fort William 13° -9 on January 6 As compared with

previous years the minima for the five months from April to August were
relatively high reading at both .stations, showing that the temperature
was during these months not only high as regards the means, but was
marked by a singular absence of such low temperatures as usually occur.

     At the top the registrations of the sunshine recorder show 680 hours

out of a possible 4,470 hours, being 122 hours fewer than during the
previous year, and 228 fewer than during 1891. The following months

exceeded "the averages : March by 20 hours, April by 60 hours, November
by 23 hours, and January by 6 hours. The maximum was 151 hours in
April, and this is also longer than any pre\ ious recorded April. All other
months fell short of the averages, and during the whole of December only
one hour's sunshine was recorded, and on the following month, viz., January
1894, only three hours' sunshine occurred. At Fort William the number
of hours of sunshine were 1,065, which is respectively 114 and 155 hours
fewer than during the previous two years. The maximum was 186 hours
in June, and the minimum 6 hours in December. At these stations, in
common with a lai'ge sun-ounding district, 1894 was characterised by a

singular deficiency of sunshine, which is remarkable in view of the high

temperature of the year. At the top of the mountain the proportion of

the actual to the possible sunshine was only 15 per cent., and at Fort
William the percentage was 30, or double that at the top.

     At the top the percentage of cloud covering the sky was 84, being the

average of previous years. It varied greatly in the different months,
 being above 90 per cent, in February, July, August, October, and December,

which were characterised by a marked deficiency of sunshine, and reached
98 per cent, in December, when, as already stated, only one hour of sun-

shine was recorded. On the other hand, the minimum 61 per cent,
occurred in April, the montli of the absolute maximum sunshine, being
 66 per cent, above the maximum of the month.

      The following table shows the lowest humidities of each month :

--results are interesting for 1892 and 1893 : Lowest dew-point, 27'^"8 and

-12°-2, highest dew-point 21°-2 and 32°-8 ; lowest elastic force 0-010 inch

and 0'024 inch; highest elastic force 0114 inch and 0"122 inch; and

lowest relative liumidity 7 and 18, and highest 47 and 47. These results

point to a large excess of aqueous vapour in the air at the Ben Nevis

Observatory during 1893.

     The rainfall for the year at the top was 16577 inches, being 18'00

inches above the mean annual rainfall. At Fort William the amount was

83*54 inches, which is 1037 inches above the mean. These amounts are re-

spectively 1 2 and 1 4 per cent, above their averages. The maximum monthly

rainfall at the Ben Nevis Observatory was 2566 inches, in December, and
the minimum 5*48 inches, in May. The minimum monthly fall for 1892

was 5"42 inches in March, and these two years show the largest minimum

falls of any of the years since the Observatory was opened. Hence, at

this high level situation the rainfall was not only considerably above the

mean, but it continued to be relatively large through all the months of

this year, which will be long remarkable for an unprecedented drought

over a large portion of the British Islands. On the other hand, at the
Low Level Observatory the amount of the rainfall was short of the average

for each of the five months from March to July, the deficiency amounting

to 5-12 inches.

     At Fort William the rain fell on 235 days, and at the top on 260 days,

being respectively 3 days under and 26 days above their averages. The

maximum number of days on which rain fell was 31 days at the top and

29 at Fort William in December, and the minimum number 16 days in

March and 12 days in June respectively.

     The maximum daily rainfall at the top was 4-29 inches on Novem-

ber 28, and at Fort William 3*25 inches on October 24. At the former

station instances of one inch a day or upwards occurred during each of

the twelve months, whereas at Fort William, during the five months from

March to July, the rainfall on none of the days reached an inch. During

the year the rainfall amounted to an inch or upwards on 51 days, but at

Fort William the number of days was only 12, being a lower proportion

at Fort William, as compared with the top, than has previously been

recorded. Thus, while during the spring and early summer of 1893 Fort

William participated in some degree in the prevailing drought, the rainfall

and moisture at the Ben Nevis Observatory were above their average, a

result probably occasioned by the stronger ascending currents from the

superheated surface of the earth carrying to higher levels than usual the

moisture of lower levels.

during the rest of the month, so that on several nights the usual daily weather
report could not be wired to the newspapers. The thunderstorm of July 7-8,
though very severe, was foi-tunately unaccompanied by any damage.

    At Fort William the mean atmospheric pressure at 32° and sea level

was 29"871 inches, and at the top 25"324 inches, the difference being thus
4'547 inches. The lowest pressure at the top for the year was 23-888
inches in December and the highest 26 "003 inches in April, the difference
being 2"115 inches, being considerably above the average difference. This
large difference was due to the low reading in December, which was an
altogether exceptional month as regards the almost continuous saturated
state of the atmosphere, and to the high readings which accompanied the
anticyclonic weather of the spring and early summer. In truth, the
monthly means were uninterruptedly above the average for the six months
from March to August, the mean excess for the half-year being so much
as O'lOl inch above the average, an excess only exceeded in 1887, the
Jubilee year, when the mean monthly pressure was uninterruptedly above
the average from February to July, the mean excess being 0'14:4 inch.
This period was also strongly anticyclonic.

    The important hygrometric research carried on at the High and Low

Level Observatories and described in the Committee's last two Reports
to the British Association has been continued. During the past year

Mr. Herbertson has conducted the observations with the assistance of
Mr. Angus Rankin, First Assistant at the Observatories, and of Mr. F. J.
Hambly, F.C.S., F.I.C., Assistant Lecturer on Chemistry at University
College, Dundee ; and of Mr. Marr, Demonstrator of Botany in the same

College.

    An Assmann aspiration psychrometer was read for dry and wet bulb

temperatures, in addition to the thermometers in the Stevenson screen.
The dust particles in the air Avere counted, and the general weather con-
ditions of each experiment were noted. Nearly 100 experiments were

made at both observatories, of which 57 were synchronous.

   A comparison of the readings of the ventilated thermometers with

those of the screen only shows that in calm, or virtually calm, weather

the wet-bulb in the Stevenson box is much nearer the dry-bulb reading

than in the Assmann aspiration psychrometer. When no measures are

taken for causing an air current to pass the thermometer bulbs, all
readings made in calm or light airs require to be neglected in hygro-
metric work. Under ordinary conditions, the total amount of water

vapour in the air does not vary much in a fine day.

   A discussion of the simultaneous observations at high- and low-levels

brings out some very interesting results. On September 11, 1893, with a,

normal temperature gradient between the two observatories, the water-
vapour remained fairly constant at both places all day, there being an

excess of about 1-5 gramme per cubic metre at the lower station. On

September 4 the summit temperature was only from 2° to 7° lower than
at Fort William, instead of 16°'0 the normal difference ; and on this
occasion the difference between the quantities of water- vapour was as great
as from 6-67 to 4"60 grammes per cubic metre. This great variation was
almost entirely due to changes in the amount of water-vapour in the
upper air, since there was a steady increase of vapour from 9*15 grammes
per cubic metre at 9 a.m. to 10'56 at 2 p.m., and 11 '40 at 7 p.m. at the low-
level station ; whereas the vapour at the summit was 2*72 at 9 a.m., 5-96

at 2 p.m., 392 at 5 p.m., 5-55 at 7 p.m., and 5-89 at 9 p.m. ; the maximum

at the summit at 2 p.m. being evidently caused by an uprush of moister

air from the valleys. Thin cirrus clouds floated above the hill all day,

and detached masses of fog were in the valleys. The next day the hill-

top was enveloped in mist, and thick cumulus clouds were observed over

Fort William with a smaller hourly variation both of temperature and

water-vapour,

Mr. Marr continued the work at Fort William at Christmas, and

Mr. Herbertson in May, the latter having carried on the experiments

in the drier air of Montpellier during the early months of this year.

These data have served to extend the curves drawn from the figures

already obtained, the Montpellier results being found to agree well with

those made at Fort William where they overlapped.

It is Mr. Herbertson's intention to continue these investigations in the

coming autumn and winter, more special attention being then given to

secure an increased number of simultaneous high and low determinations

of water-vapour.

The inquiry into the hourly variation of pressure and temperature at

the observatories during days of clear weather on the one hand, and days

of fog or mist throughout on the other, has been prosecuted during the

year. On completing the hourly variations of pressure during each of
these two distinct types of weather at the Low Level Observatory at Fort

William on the same days at the top of the mountain, it was seen that

substantially the same sets of curves obtained in both situations. In

particular at both places the same extraordinarily high pressure from

about 6 P.M. to 2 a.m. occurs during days of fog or mist, or completely

clouded days, thus demonstrating the important role played by the

aqueous vapour of the atmosphere in the diurnal meteorological changes.

The point was considered to be of such importance as to warrant the

extension of the inquiry to another place where the climate, as regards

moisture, resembles in some degree that of Fort William. Trieste, at the

head of the Adriatic Sea, was selected for examination, particularly since

the hourly values for pressure and sunshine are published for this place.
The results for the three observatories are given in Tables III. to VIII.

of this Report. The times over which the inquiry extends are three years,

from August 1890 to July 1892 for the Ben Nevis Observatories, and the

three years 1888 to 1890 for Trieste. The results have been ' bloxamed,' as-

explained in our last Report (p. 284).
     The results of the investigation, so far as it has been carried, are,

broadly stated, these : --During fine cloudless weather the hourly curves,

of the three places are virtually congruent with their curves for the

whole of the observations, clear and clouded alike, except that the diurnal
phases of maxima and minima are more strongly pronounced, and the

evening maximum is continued for a shorter period. During foggy and

clouded weather each of the three places shows in the colder months
of the year the ordinary double maxima and minima of pressure fairly

well marked. It is quite otherwise in the warmer months, when at the
Ben Nevis Observatories the morning maximum is virtually obliterated,
and Trieste very greatly reduced. It is, however, the evening maximum

which shows the most surprising results. This is at all seasons at the
low-level stations, but in the warmer months it is the outstanding feature

of the curves. For May, June, and July the mean at the top is 0-018
inch, at Fort William 0023 inch, and at Trieste also 0023 inch. In
these months the maximum of this phase of the barometric curve occurred

either at midnight or shortly before it.

The temperature curves for the Ben Nevis Observatory have also been

189'1.                                                1

calculated, with the result that on clear days the diurnal range of tempera-

ture is only very slightly in excess of that of foggy days. But in summer
the difference between the mean coldest and warmest hour is l°'l ; but

on clear days the difference is 2°"9, or nearly three times greater.
     The further prosecution of this inquiry and examination of the

cyclones and anti-cyclones of North-Western Europe will engage the
attention of your Committee next year, when a large portion of the time

of Dr. Buchan and Mr. Omond will be given to this work.

     The Committee regret that the insulation of some of the coils referred
to in their last Report, which had been selected for the new standards of
resistance, as defined by the resolutions adopted at Edinburgh, has proved
defective. Traces of acid have been discovered in the paraffin with which
the coils were filled. The two one-ohm standards of the Association,'
as well as two of the one-ohm standards of the Board of Trade,^ were
found in January last to have so low an insulation resistance between the
coil and the case as to be useless.

     Thus the labour spent in the testing of these coils has been wasted
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

much of it will need to be done again. The insulation of some of the
other standard ohm coils is not satisfactory. The single ohm standards

have therefore been remade, and the others are being refilled with carefully
selected paraffin. The original B.A. units have not, so far as comparisons
between them can show, changed their values during the year, and one

set of new ohm standards also has shown no sign of change.
     The Committee print, as an appendix to the Report, the report of the

proceedings at the International Congress at Chicago, presented to the
Secretary of State at Washington by the American delegate to the
Conference.

     During the j'ear Professor J. V. Jones has determined, by the aid of
his Lorenz apparatus, the absolute resistance of certain wire coils of
about -1 ohm. These have been compared with the standards of the

Association by the Secretary. An account of these experiments is con-

tained in Appendices II. and III. The resistance standards of the
Association have been compared with those of the Board of Trade by
Mr. Rennie and the Secretary. Details of this comparison will be found
in Appendix IV., while in Appendix V. is given, by Mr. E. O. Walker,
an account of a comparison between five coils belonging to the Indian
Government, which have been for twenty-four years in India, and Dr.
Muirhead's standards. Mr. Fitzpatrick has continued his work on the
specific resistance of copper, and has drawn up a table (see Appendix
VI.) reducing to the same units experimental results recently obtained
by various observers. Appendix VII. contains the Final Report of the
Electrical Standards Committee of the Board of Trade and the Order in
Council relating to Standards for Electrical Measurement.

     In consequence of the difficulty met with in the insulation of some of
the coils, it was thought well to defer the purchase of other coils for
which the grant of 25^. was obtained last year. The Committee are of
opinion that it is desirable to complete their set of standards by obtaining
from Germany certified copies of the standards of the Reichsanstalt.
They recommend, therefore, that they be reappointed, with the addition
of the name of Mr. Rennie, and with a grant of 251. ; that Professor G.
Carey Foster be Chairman and Mr. R. T. Glazebrook Secretary.

Electrical Congress to be held in August at Chicago, beg to submit
herewith a brief report showing the definitive action of said Congress in
the matter of defining and naming units of electrical measure. The
consideration of this important subject was left to what -was known as
the ' Chamber of Delegates ' of the Congress, consisting only of those
who had been officially commissioned by their respective Governments to
act as members of said Chamber. After conference and correspondence
with the leading electricians of Europe, it had been agreed that the

maximum number of such delegates to be allowed to one nation should be
five, and this number was allotted to the United States, Great Britain,

Germany, and France. Other nations were allowed three or two, and in
some instances one.

      Delegates present and taking part in the discussions and action of the
Chamber were as follows :

                                    Representing the United States.

President of the Chamber of Delegates.

Meetings of the Chamber continued during six days, at the end of

which its members unanimously agreed in the adoption of the following
resolution :^

Resolved, That the several Governments represented by the delegates

of this International Congress of Electricians be, and they are hereby,

recommended to formally adopt as legal units of electrical measure the

following : As a unit of resistance, the international ohm, which is based
upon the ohm equal to 10^ units of resistance of the C.G.S. system of

electro-magnetic units, and is represented by the resistance offered to an

unvarying electric current by a column of mercury at the temperature of

melting ice 14'-1521 grammes in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area

and of the length of 106 '3 cm.

As a unit of current, the international ampere, which is one-tenth of

the unit of current of the C.G.S. system of electro-magnetic units, and

which is represented sufficiently well for practical use by the unvarying

current which, when passed through a solution of nitrate of silver in

water, and, in accordance with accompanying specifications,' deposits

silver at the rate of O'OOlllS of a gramme per second.

     ' In the following specification the term silver voltameter means the arrange-
ment of apparatus by means of which an electric current is pa.ssed through a
solution of nitrate of silver in water. The silver voltameter measures the total
electrical quantity which has passed during the time of the experiment, and by
noting this time the time average of the current, or, if the ctirrent has been, kept
constant, the current itself, can be deduced.

     la employing the silver voltameter to measure cturrents of about one ampere the
following arrangements should be adopted :

     The kathode on which the silver is to be deposited should take the form of a
122 REPORT-- 1894.

    As a unit of electro-motive force, the international volt, which is the

electro-motive force that, steadily applied to a conductor whose resistance
is one international ohm, will produce a current of one international
ampere, and which is represented sufficiently well for practical \ise by
t5t5¥ °^ *^® electro-motive force between the poles or electrodes of the

voltaic cell known as Clark's cell, at a temperature of 15° C, and
prepared in the manner described in the accompanying specification.^

     As a unit of quantity, the international coulomb, which is the quantity

of electricity transferred by a current of one international ampere in one

second.

    As a unit of capacity, the international farad, which is the capacity

of a condenser charged to a potential of one international volt by one
international coulomb of electricity.

     As a unit of work, the joule, which is equal to 10^ units of woi-k

in the C.G.S. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for
practical use by the energy expended in one second by an international
ampere in an international ohm.

    As a unit of power, the ^catt, which is equal to 10" units of power in

the C.G.S. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for practical
use by the work done at the rate of one joule per second.

    As the unit of induction, the henry, which is the induction in a
circuit when the electro-motive force induced in this circuit is one inter-

national volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one ampere

per second.

     The Chamber also voted that it was not wise to adopt or I'ecommend

a standard of light at the present time.

A more complete report of the operations of the Chamber will shortly

be forwarded. This brief resum^ of its definite action in reference to the

matter of units is now submitted to facilitate the prompt dissemination
among representatives of foreign Governments of the important results of

a congress of whose success and fruitfulness the United States may justly

be proud.

platinum bowl not less than 10 centinaetres in diameter and from 4 to 5 centimetres

in depth.

    The anode should be a plate of pure silver some oO sq. cm. in area and 2 or 3 mm.

in thickness.

     This is supported horizontally in the liquid near the top of the solution by a
platinum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite corners. To prevent
the disintegrated silver which is formed on the anode from falling on to the
kathode, the anode should be wrapped round with pure filter jiaper, secured at the
back with sealing-wax.

     The liquid should consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate, containing
about 15 parts by weight of the nitrate to 85 parts of water.

     The resistance of the voltameter charges somewhat as the current passes. To
prevent these changes having too great an effect on the current, some resistance
besides that of the voltameter should be inserted in the circuit. The total metallic

resistance of the circuit should not be less than 10 ohms.

    A' committee, consisting of Messrs. Helmholtz, Ayrton, and Carhart, was ap-

pointed to prepare specifications for the Clark's cell. Their report has not yet been

received.

                              APPENDIX II.

On a Determination of the International Ohm in Absolute Measure. By

     Professor J. V. Jones, F.R.S., Principal of the University College of
     South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff.

     The apparatus for tlie absolute measurement of electrical resistance

myin laboratory at Cardiff" -was completed in 1890, and I first used it

for the determination of tlie specific resistance of mercury in absolute
measure.^ This determination -was made by direct measurement on a
mercury column contained in a trough of paraffin wax. The I'esults of
five complete sets of observations were as follows :

                                                                           94103
                                                                           94074
                                                                           94093
                                                                           94045
                                                                           94021

     The mean of these is 94067 ; and the extreme variation from the
mean is 46, or about four pai-ts in 10,000.

I suspected that much of the variation was due to the paraffin trough,

the temperature of which varied slightly (about half a degree) during

the observations, and was not accurately measurable owing to the low

conductivity of tlie material. With variation of temperature there was

variation of breadth, and the breadth of the trough entered as a primary

factor into the calculation of the specific resistance.

    When I proceeded to use the apparatus for the measurement of low-

resistance standards of solid metal this was conclusively shown to be the

case. I brought a set of measurements made on such a standard under

the attention of the Section last year at Nottingham, in which the extreme

variation from the mean was only about one part in 12,000.
    This may be taken to be the normal performance of the apparatus ; and

seeing that it is an instrument of such precision, it seemed to me of

interest to determine by the use of solid metal standards the relation

between its indications and the results obtained by other observers for the

value of the ohm.

  --With this end in view I obtained four coils from Messrs. Nalder

Brothers two platinum-silver ten-ohm coils and two manganine tenth-

ohm coils. Mr. Glazebrook has measured them in terms of the inter-

national ohm                                                     and I am  much indebted to  him  for the  pains  he has been

126 KEPORT-- 1894.

     It is clear that in the above series the chief variations are duo to
changes consequent on readjustment of the standard coil, and the re-
moval and replacement of the resistance coils in their mercury cups.
Counting as independent only those of the observations before which
there was readjustment of the standard coil or removal of the resistance

coils from the mercury cups, the general mean is

                             ·9997G.

The maximum variation from the mean is -000106, or about one part

in 10,000.

    Assuming that the international ohm is the resistance of a column
of mercury at 0^ of 1 sq. mm. sectional area, and 106"30 cm. long, we

have as a result of the above measurement that the true ohm is the

resistance of a column of mercury of the same sectional area and

106-326 cm. long.

The figure I arrived at in 1890, working direct on mercury, was

106-307, with a probable eri'or of ^f^-Oll. The new i-esult is therefore
a little larger than I was prepared for. The accuracy of the result

depends primarily on

(i) The accuracy with which the resistance coils arc known in terms

of the international ohm.

(ii) The accuracy with which their temperatures are known at the

times of observation.

(iii) The accuracy with which the coefficient of mutual induction of

the coil and disc has been determined.

    Upon the first point I can say little. Mr. Glazebrook knows better
than anyone to what figure the values of the resistances may be

relied on.

     The effect of error in estimation of the temperatures of the coils can
be but slight. The observations have been made in two ways, viz., with

one-minute tapes, the current being put on only during the time of ob-
servation, and with three-minute tapes, the current being kept on con-

tinuously, whether observations were being made or not. During the

last few days of the observations the current was kept passing through

the coils night and day. I ha\e calculated the eflect that would be

produced on the result olitained with one-minute tapes if all the heat

--generated by tlie current were to remain in the coils an extreme case,

obviously less favourable than the actual conditions. It is something

less than two parts in 100,000. The smallness of the eflfect is due to the
fact that if y is the main current, a current equal to |I1',' y passes through
the tenth-ohm manganine coil with its small temperature coefficient, and

only -5-^1  y  through  the  platinum-.silver  coils                        while the effect of  under-
                                                                         ;

estimating the temperature of the manganine tenth-ohm coil is to produce

an error in the result opposite in sign to that produced by underesti-

mating the temperature of the platinum-silver coils.

     There cannot, then, in the case of the one-minute tape oljservations be
an appreciable error due to underestimation of the temperature. But
the first four sets of observations show that the results of the one-minute

tape observations and the three-minute tape observations are practically
the same. Hence it follows that to the degree of accuracy aimed at

our results are unaffected by error due to underestimation of the

temperature.

     It remains to consider the accuracy with which the coefficient of
mutual induction of tlie coil and disc is known.

     To calculate this coefficient we must know the radius of the disc and
the mean radius of the coil. The circumference of the disc is a suf-
ficiently true circle, the disc having been ground true in place. The

measurement of its diameter presented no difficulty. It was determined

on my Whitworth measui'ing machine to the ten-thousandth of an inch.

     The mean radius of the coil cannot be determined with the same
accuracy ; but I believe that it is known to the thousandth of an inch.
The coil consists of a single layer of silk -covered wire wound in a screw
thread cut on a brass frame. It was measured along eighteen diameters
in the Whitworth machine with the following results :

Wetion in this case.  are concerned with another integral, viz.,

and the adjustment for centre is in truth of primary importance. Special
attention should therefore be paid to this in designing apparatus for the
absolute measurement of resistance by this method.

      One other point remains to be noticed in this connection, viz., the pos-
sible effect of the difference of the temperature of the coil and disc when
measured and when in use. On calculating the correction to be applied

for this cause I find it negligible.
      Again, I would say, as I said last year, that the chief value of these

observations consists in the proof they afford of the precision with which

Athe absolute measurement of resistance may be made by this method.

well-constructed apparatus of the kind in a national laboratory^say the

--Laboratory of the Board of Trade will, I believe, prove to be the best

 ultimate standard of electrical resistance.

Comparison of the Standard Coils used hy Professor Jones with

   the Standards of the Association. By R. T. Glazebrook.

The tenth-ohm standards of manganin wire whose value in absolute

measure was determined by Professor Jones by means of the experiments

described in Appendix II. were compared with the standards of the

AAssociation in the following manner.  Wheatstone's bridge was formed

in which the arms were the tenth-ohm to be tested, two single-ohm coils,

and a ten-ohm coil ; if the coils had these values exactly, there would of
course always have been a balance ; since, however, the coils were not
accurately correct, there was usually a small current through the galva-

nometer ; the balance, however, could be obtained by placing a large re-
sistance as a shunt either to one of the one-ohm coils or to the ten-ohm

coil : this resistance, which varied from 10,000 to 20,000 ohms, was taken
from a good box of coils. The resistance of the ten-ohm and of the two one-

ohm coils being known, that of the tenth-ohm coil could readily be found.

The four coils dipped into four mercury cups cut in an  ebonite   block
                                                                                    ;

the bottoms of these cups were copper pieces some 3 to 4 mm. thick.

Binding screws screwed into these copper pieces and rising above

the mercury served to connect the bridge to the galvanometer and the

battery.

   --The mercury cups were somewhat large about 2'5 cm. in diameter

and it was found on January 16 that distinct differences could be observed

by moving the tenth-ohm coils slightly so as to bring their terminals

either close to or as far as possible from the feet of the one-ohm coils

which dipped into the same cups. After this date then two sets of
measurements were made for each coil at each observation : in the one
the terminals of the coils in any cup were put as close together as possible,

in the other the terminals of the tenth-ohm coils were placed at some distance

from those of the other coil in the same cup.

Both sets of values are given in the table as a means of showing the

delicacy of the observations and the error aiising from this cause. The
ON STANDARDS FOR. USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 129

tenth-ohm coils were weighted so as to press firmly on to the copper

bottoms. No variation was produced by shifting the ten-ohm coil in

its cup.

     One or two Leclanche cells wore used in the various experiments : the
coils were in water-baths and the temperatures read by a standardised

Kew thermometer.

    The standard coils used were^

     In the results of the experiments made after January 15 the two
values given correspond to the two positions of the coil in the mercury
cup. They are included to show the magnitude of the error, which may

be due to the resistance of the copper bottoms of the cup.

        In the accompanying table are given the results of comparisons which

were made on May 29 and 30, 1894, at the Cavendish Laboratory, between

the three unit coils :

B.A. standards, Flat, F, G, and H.

     The bridge was of the Carey Foster pattern, constructed for the
Department by Nalder Bros, and Co., and the slide wire used was the
one marked B, having a value of -000,050,9 ohm per division.

   A 100-ohm coil, Elliott's No. 291, was placed in parallel with the

Board of Trade coil for each comparison, this being effected by a large

mercury-in-paraffin bath.

     Temperatures were measured by a mercury-in-glass thermometer, which
had been standardised at Kew,

     Only in cases where considerable masses of the material are used
can the specitic gravity, and from this the cross-section of the wires, be
accurately determined. There is, therefore, an evident advantage in
expressing results in terms of weight, as then the determination of the
cross-section of the wires becomes unnecessary, and there is no reason

why an accuracy of one in two or three thousand should not be attained.

     Again, it is found that different samples of copper have different
densities, according to the method by which they have been prepared ; in
a table · which I published on a previous occasion the variation is from

3-86 to 8-95. Mr. Swan - gives a value as high as 8-9587.
     From samples of copper of the same quality I have had wires drawn

which differed in density ; it was always found that the denser the copper
the less is its resistance, and the difference affects much more the results
expressed as specific resistances than when expressed as the resistance for
a gramme per metre.

      This is another reason for expressing the results in these terms, at least
as well as specific resistances, and for actual practical purposes it is a
question of weight rather than volume.

     In the following tables the results are given for a temperature of

18° C. in CG.S. units :--

statement, which I liave previously made, that it is impossible to prepare

wires on the small scale which are of the same quality, i.e., probably due

to density, as the best specimens specially prepared by large manufacturers.

In Table B are given the results of measurements on three specimens

of copper prepared  by Mr.  Swan                                          one  was given  to  Profs.  Dewar and
                                                                       :

Fleming ; a second was examined by Mr. Swan liimself, and a third

specimen he kindly sent to me ; the quality of the copper in the three

cases may therefore be expected to be the same.

The results of Profs. Dewar and Fleming and Messrs. Swan and

Rhodin are expressed only as specific resistances, whilst the result of my

measurement is only given for a wire one metre long weighing one gramme.

The weight of the copper wire, as measured, was only three grammes, and

that does not allow the accurate determination of the specific gravity of the

sample. The value I obtain for its resistance is identical with that for the

sample of annealed copper wire sent me by Messrs. Bolton.

If it be considered to have the same specific gravity as that sample

(8-94) its specific resistance in C.G.S. units is 1665 ; a value distinctly

smaller than that obtained by Messrs. Swan and Rhodin, whose result is
practically identical with that of Profs. Dewar and Fleming.

Not only may wires drawn from the same specimen of copper have

different densities and different resistances, but the variation of that

resistance with change of temperature may be also diflferent.

In the following table are given the temperature coefficients of various

specimens of copper :

     Either of these two methods seems to give satisfactory results. For
completely annealing silver wires the temperature of the paraffin bath

is not sufficiently high, but from the results of my measurements for

silver, for which the influence of annealing is very considerable, it can be
seen that the first method is quite satisfactory.

                                                         Silver.

    Many of the older measurements for resistances and conductivities are

expressed in terms of the resistance of pure silver : this was the case with

Matthiessen's earlier results.

     Some measurements therefore made on silver wires are given, together
with the results obtained by Matthiessen and Profs. Dewar and Fleming

for the sake of comparison.

     Several samples of silver wires were supplied by Messrs. Johnson and
Matthey : one of tliese was stated to be absolutely pure.

     The results are expressed for wires weighing one gramme per metre.

            --
136 REPORT-- 1894.

In the case of copper ' with increase of purity there is a decrease in

the difference in resistance between annealed and hard-drawn wires.

With silver the reverse is the case.

The value that I obtained for the hard-drawn wire is very nearly the

same as that given by Matthiessen, but he obtained a greater decrease in

Heresistance on annealing.    states ^ that for different pieces of the same

wire there was a variation of from 6 to 10 per cent. ; so that the dif-

ference between his value and that which T have obtained for a sample of

pure silver is not greater than might be expected.

The considerable variation in all the values given above makes it clear

that the values of the specific resistance depend not simply on the purity

of the material, but on a number of other factors, which will be different

in the cases of different wires of the same material, and that therefore

we cannot expect to attain to any great degree of accuracy in the

determination of specific resistances as distinguished from the accurate
measurement for some particular wire.

Final Report of the Electrical Standards Committee of the Board of Trade.

         To the Right Hon. James Bryce, M.P.,
                President of the Board of Trade.

Since the date of our last Report the Board of Trade have laid before

us a resume of the action of the International Electrical Congress held

in Chicago in August 1893 to determine the units of electrical measure-

Wement.  were also informed by the Boaixl of Trade that her Majesty's

Govei-nment had been invited by the United States Ambassador in

London to take steps to adopt the recommendations of the Congress.

These recommendations, so far as they refer to the units of electrical

resistance, electrical current, and electrical pressure, are substantially the

same as those suggested for adoption in our previous Reports.

   We see no reason f(jr further delay in the legalisation of standards of

the above-mentioned units, and we have prepared and attach a revised

Draft Order in Council,^ which we advise may be submitted for her

Majesty's gracious approval.

The accompanying notes * to the specification for the Clark's cell have

been communicated by Mr. Glazebrook, and will be found of great

assistance in the preparation of this form of cell.

Order in Council regarding Standards /or Electrical Measurements.

           At the Court at Onhorne Hovse, Isle of Wight, Auf/vst 23, 1894.
               Prwent : The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in dmncil.

     Whereas by 'The Weights and Measures Act, 1889,' it is among other
things enacted that the Board of Trade shall from time to time cause such
new denominations of standards for the measurement of electricity as
appear to them to be required for use in trade to be made and duly

verified.

    And whereas it has been made to appear to the Board of Trade that

new denominations of standards are required for use in trade based upon

the following units of electrical measurement, viz.

1. The ohm, which has the value 10^ in terms of the centimetre and

the second of time, and is represented by the I'esistance offered to an

unvarying electric current by a column of mercury at the temperature of

melting ice 14-4521 grammes in mass of a constant cross-sectional area

and of a length of 106 '3 centimetres.

2. The ampere, which has the value )',, in terms of the centimetre,

the gramme, and the second of time, and which is represented Ijy the

unvarying electric current which when passed through a solution of

nitrate of silver in water in accordance with the specification appended

hei-eto, and marked A, deposits silver at the rate of O'OOlllS of a gramme

per second.

3. The volt, which has the value 10* in terms of the centimetre, the

gramme, and the second of time, being the electrical pressure that if

steadily applied to a conductor whose resistance is one ohm will produce

a current of one ampere, and which is represented by -6974 (|yf}^) of the

electrical pressure at a temperature of 15° C. between the poles of the

voltaic cell known as Clark's cell set up in accordance with the specification

appended hereto, and marked B.

    And whereas they have caused the said new denominations of stan-

dards to be made and duly verified.

     Now, therefore, her Majesty, by virtue of the power vested in her
by the said Act, by and with the advice of her Privy Council, is pleased

to approve the several denominations of standards set forth in the

schedule hereto as new denominations of standards for electrical measureT

luent.                                               C. L. Peel.

                                                  Schedule.

                            I. Standard of Electrical Resistance.

   A standard of electrical resistance denominated one ohm being the

resistance between the copper terminals of the instrument marked ' Board

of Trade Ohm Standard Verified, 1894,' to the passage of an unvarying

electrical current when the coil- of insulated wire forming part of the
aforesaid instrument and connected to the aforesaid terminals is in all

parts at a temperature of 15° '4 C.

                             II. Standard of Electrical Current.

   A standard of electrical current denominated one ampere being the

current which is passing in and through the coils of wire forming part of
the instrument marked 'Board of Trade Ampere Standard Verified, 1894,'
when on reversing the current in the fixed coils the change in the forces
            ----

138 REPORT-- 1894.

acting upon the suspended coil in its sighted position is exactly balanced
by the force exerted by gravity in Westminster upon the iridio-platinum

Aweight marked and forming part of the said instrument,

                           III. Standard of Electrical Pressure.

   A standard of electrical pressure denominated one volt, being one

hundredth part of the pressure which when applied between the terminals
forming part of the instrument marked ' Board of Trade Volt Standard

Verified, 1894,' causes that rotation of the suspended portion of the
instrument which is exactly measured by the coincidence of the sighting

Awire with the image of the fiducial mark before and after application

of the pressure and with that of the fiducial mark B during the applica-

tion of the pressure, these images being produced by the suspended
mirror and observed by means of the eyepiece.

      In the use of the above standards the limits of accuracy attainable
are as follows :

         For the ohm, within one hundredth part of one per cent.
         For the ampere, within one tenth part of one per cent.
         For the volt, within one tenth part of one per cent.

     The coils and instruments referred to in this schedule are deposited at
the Board of Trade Standardising Laboratory, 8 Richmond Terrace,
Whitehall, London.

  Specifications referred to in the foregoing Order in Council.

                                          SPECIFICATION A.

     In the following specification the term silver voltameter means the
arrangement of apparatus by means of which an electric current is passed
through a solution of nitrate of silver in water. The silver voltameter
measures tlie total electrical quantity which has passed duidng the time of
the experiment, and by noting this time the time-average of the current, or if
the current has been kept constant the current itself, can be deduced.

     In employing the silver voltameter to measure currents of about
1 ampere the following arrangements should be adopted. The kathode
on which the silver is to be deposited should take the form of a platinum
bowl not less than 10 centimetres in diameter, and from 4 to 5 centimetres

in depth.

     The anode should be a plate of pure silver some 30 square centimetres
in area and 2 or 3 millimetres in thickness.

      This is supported horizontally in the liquid near the top of the solution

by a platinum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite corners.
To prevent the disintegrated silver which is formed on the anode from
falling on to the kathode, the anode should be wrapped round with pure
filter paper, secured at the back with sealing-wax.

     The liquid should consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate,
containing about 15 parts by weight of the nitrate to 85 parts of water.

     The resistance of the voltameter changes somewhat as the current
passes. To prevent these changes having too great an eSect on the
current, some resistance besides that of the voltameter should be inserted
in the circuit. The total metallic resistance of the circuit should not be

less than 10 ohms.
           ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 139

                           Method of making a Measuremerit.

     The platinum bowl is washed with nitric acid and distilled water, dried

by heat, and then left to cool in a desiccator. When thoroughly dry it is

weighed carefully.
     It is nearly filled with the solution, and connected to the rest of the

circuit by being placed on a clean copper support to which a binding
screw is attached. This copper support must be insulated.

     The anode is then immersed in the solution so as to be well covered
by it and supported in that position ; the connections to the rest of the
circuit are made.

     Contact is made at the key, noting the time of contact. The current
is allowed to pass for not less than half an hour, and the time at which
contact is broken is observed. Care must be taken that the clock used is

keeping correct time during this interval.

     The solution is now removed fi-om the bowl and the deposit is washed

with distilled water and left to soak for at least six hours. It is then
rinsed successively with distilled water and absolute alcohol and dried in
a hot-air bath at a temperature of about 160° C. After cooling in a
desiccator it is weighed again. The gain in weight gives the silver

deposited.

     To find the current in amperes, this weight, expressed in grammes,
must be divided by the number of seconds during which the cun-ent has
been passed, and by 0-001118.

     The result will be the time-average of the current, if during the

interval the current has varied.

     In determining by this method the constant of an instrument the
current should be kept as nearly constant as possible, and the readings of
the instrument observed at frequent intervals of time. These observa-
tions give a curve from which the reading corresponding to the mean
current (time- average of the current) can be found. The current, as
calculated by the voltameter, corresponds to this reading.

                                           SPECIFICATION B.

                   On the Preparatiox of the Clark Cell.

                                            Definition of the Cell.

     The cell consists of zinc or an amalgam of zinc with mercury and of
mercury in a neutral saturated solution of zinc sulphate and mercurous
sulphate in water, prepared with mercurous sulphate in excess.

                                      Preparation of the Materials.

   --1. The Mercury. To secure purity it should be first treated with acid

in the usual manner, and subsequently distilled in vacuo.

   --2. The Zinc. Take a portion of a rod of pure redistilled zinc, solder

to one end a piece of copper wire, clean the whole with glass paper or a
steel burnisher, carefully removing any loose pieces of the zinc. Just
before making up the cell dip the zinc into dilute sulphuric acid, wash

--with distilled water, and dry with a clean cloth or filter paper.
     3. The Mercurous Sulphate. Take mercurous sulphate, purchased as
pure, mix with it a small quantity of pure mercury, and wash the whole
140 REPORT-- 1894.

thoroughly with cold distilled water by agitation in a bottle ; drain off the
water, and repeat the process at least twice. After the last washing

drain off as much of the water as possible.

   --4. The Zinc Sulphate Solution. Prepare a neutral saturated solution

of pure (' pure recrystallised ') sine sulphate by mixing in a flask distilled
water with nearly twice its weight of crystals of pure zinc sulphate, and
adding zinc oxide in the proportion of about 2 per cent, by weight of the
zinc sulphate crystals to neutralise any free acid. The crystals should
be dissolved with the aid of gentle heat, but the temperature to which
the solution is raised should not exceed 30° C. Mercurous sulphate
treated as described in 3 should be added in the proportion of about
12 per cent, by weight of the zinc sulphate crystals to neutralise any free
zinc oxide remaining, and the solution filtered, while still warm, into a
stock bottle. Crystals should form as it cools.

   --5. The Mercurous Sulphate and Zinc Sulphate Paste. Mix the

washed mercurous sulphate with the zinc sulphate solution, adding
sufficient crystals of zinc sulphate from the stock bottle to ensure satura-
tion, and a small quantity of pure mercury. Shake these up well
together to form a paste of the consistence of cream. Heat the paste,
but not above a temperature of 30° C. Keep the paste for an hour at this
temperature, agitating it from time to time, then allow it to cool ; con-
tinue to shake it occasionally while it is cooling. Crystals of zinc sul-
phate should then be distinctly visible, and should be distributed throughout
the mass. If this is not the case add more crystals from the stock bottle,
and repeat the whole process.

     This method ensures the formation of a saturated solution of zinc and
mercurous sulphates in water.

                                          To set np the Cell.

    The cell may conveniently be set up in a small test-tube of about

2 centimetres diameter and 4 or 5 centimetres deep. Place the mercury
in the bottom of this tube, filling it to a depth of, say, "5 centimetre.
Cut a cork about -5 centimetre thick to fit the tube ; at one side of the
cork bore a hole through which the zinc rod can pass tightly ; at the other
side bore another hole for the glass tube which covers the platinum wire

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

at the edge of the cork cut a nick through which the air can pass when
the cork is pushed into the tube. Wash the cork thoroughly with warm
water, and leave it to soak in water for some hours before use. Pass the

zinc rod about 1 centimetre through the cork.

     Contact is made with the mercury by means of a platinum wire about

No. 22 gauge. This is protected from contact with the other materials
of the cell by being sealed into a glass tube. The ends of the wire project
from the ends of the tube ; one end forms the terminal, the other end and
a portion of the glass tube dip into the mercury.

     Clean the glass tube and platinum wire carefully, then heat the
exposed end of the platinum red-hot, and insert it in the mercury in the
test-tube, taking care that the whole of the exposed platinum is covered.

     Shake up the paste and introduce it without contact with the upper
part of the walls of the test-tube, filling the tube above the mercury to a
depth of rather more than 1 centimetre.

     Then insert the cork and zinc rod, passing the glass tube through the
hole prepared for it. Push the cork gently down until its lower surface
is nearly in contact with the liquid. The air will thus be nearly all
           ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 141

expelled, and the cell should be left in this condition for at least twenty-
four hours before sealing, which should be done as follows.

     Melt some marine glue until it is fluid enough to pour by its own

weight, and pour it into the test-tube above the cork, using sufficient
to cover completely the zinc and soldering. The glass tube containing
the platinum wire should project some way above the top of the marine

glue.

    The cell may be sealed in a more permanent manner by coating the
marine glue, when it is set, with a solution of sodium silicate, and leaving

it to harden.

     The cell thus set up may be mounted in any desirable manner. It
is convenient to arrange the mounting so that the cell may be immersed
in a water-bath up to the level of, say, the upper surface of the cork. Its
temperature can then be determined more accurately than is possible when

the cell is in air.

     In using the cell sudden variations of temperature should as far as
possible be avoided.

     The form of the vessel containing the cell may be varied. In the

H form the zinc is replaced by an amalgam of ten parts by weight of zinc

to ninety of mercury. The other materials should be prepared as already
described. Contact is made with the amalgam in one leg of the cell and
with the mercury in the other by means of platinum wires sealed through

the glass.

         Notes to the Specification on the Preparation of the
                                            Clark Cell.

   --The Mercurous Sulphate. The treatment of the mercurous sulphate

has for its object the removal of any mercuric sulphate which is often
present as an impurity.

      Mercuric sulphate decomposes in the presence of water into an acid

--and a basic sulphate. The latter is a yellow substance turpeth mineral
--practically insoluble in water ; its presence at any rate in moderate

quantities has no effect on the cell. If, however, it is formed, the acid
sulphate is formed also. This is soluble in water, and the acid produced
affects the electro-motive force. The object of the washings is to dissolve
and remove this acid sulphate, and for this purpose the three washings
described in the specification will in nearly all cases suffice. If, however,
a. great deal of the turpeth mineral is formed, it shows that there is a
great deal of the acid sulphate present, and it will then be wiser to obtain
a fresh sample of mercurous sulphate rather than to try by repeated
washings to get rid of all the acid.

     The free mercury helps in the process of removing the acid, for the
acid mei'curic sulphate attacks it, forming mercurous sulphate and acid
which is washed away.

     Pure mercurous sulphate when quite free from acid shows on repeated
washing a faint primrose tinge, which is due to the formation of a basic
mercurous salt, and is distinct from the turpeth mineral or basic mercuric
sulphate. The appearance of this primrose tint may be taken as an
indication of the fact that all the acid has been removed, and the washing
may with advantage be continued until this primrose tint appears. Should

large quantities of this basic mercurous salt be formed, the sulphate should
be treated as described in the instructions for setting up Clark's cells
--142 REPORT 1894.

--Instrumentenkunde,' 1893, Heft 5.
     The Zinc Sulphate Solution. The object to be attained is the pre-

paration of a neutral solution of pure zinc sulphate saturated with

ZnSO^THaO.
    At temperatures above 30° C. the zinc sulphate may crystallise out in

another form ; to avoid this, 30° C. should be the upper limit of tem-

perature. At this temperature water will dissolve about 1"9 time its

weight of the crystals. If any of the crystals put in remain undissolved

they will be removed by the filtration.

The zinc sulphate should be free from iron, and should be tested before

use with sulphocyanide of potassium to ascertain that this condition is
satisfied. If an appreciable amount of iron is present it should be re-

moved by the method given in the directions already quoted, ' Zeitschrift

fiir Instrumentenkunde,' 1893, Heft 5.
     The amount of zinc oxide required depends on the acidity of the

solution, but 2 per cent, will, in all cases which will arise in practice with

reasonably good zinc sulphate, be ample. Another rule would be to add

the zinc oxide gradually until the solution became slightly milky. Tlie

solution when put into the cell should not contain any free zinc oxide ;
if it does, then, when mixed with the mercurous sulphate, zinc sulphate
and mercurous oxide are formed ; the latter may be deposited on the
zinc and affect the electro-motive force of the cell. The difiiculty is

avoided by adding as described about 1 2 per cent, of mercurous sulphate

before filtration : this is more than sufficient to combine with the whole

of the zinc oxide originally put in, if it all remains free. The mercurous

oxide formed, together with any undissolved mercurous sulphate, is

removed by the filtration.

  --The Mercurous Sulphate and Zinc Sulphate Paste. Although, after

the last washing of the mercurous sulphate, as much water as possible

Fig. 2.  may have been drained off, sufficient water

         generally remains to necessitate tlie addition

         of a very considerable quantity of crystals of

         zinc sulphate from the stock bottle, in order

         to insure saturation, when tlie washed mer-

         curous sulphate is added to the zinc sulphate

         solution as described in No. 4 of Specification

         B appended to the Order in Council.

         If the sides of the test tube above the

         cork be soiled by the introduction of the

         paste, the marine glue doos not adhere to

         the glass ; the liquid in the cell rises by
         capillary action between the glue and the

         glass, and may damage the cell.

         The form of the vessel containing the cell

         Hmay be varied. In the          form devised by

         Lord Rayleigh and modified by Dr. Kahle the

         zinc is replaced by an amalgam of zinc and

mercury. The other materials should be prepared as already described.

Contact is made with the amalgam in one leg of the cell and with the

mercury in the other by means of platinum wires sealed through the glass.

The amalgam consists of about ninety parts of pure mercury mixed

with ten parts of pure redistilled zinc. These are heated in a porcelain
                       ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 143

crucible to about 100° C, and gently stirred until the zinc is completely
dissolved in the mercury. The amalgam is liquid while warm, and must

be poured into the cell before it becomes solid on cooling.

The vessel containing the element consists of two vertical tubes.

These, as shown in the figure, are closed below and open above into a

common neck, which can be closed by a ground stopper of glass. The

two tubes should be 2 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. in length. The neck

Ashould be at least 1-5 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. long.                    short length

of platinum wire is sealed through the bottom of each tube.

The end of the wire in one tube is covered by a small quantity of

pure mercury, that in the other tube by the zinc-mercury amalgam.
    Above the mercury a layer about 1 cm. thick of the mercurous

sulphate paste is placed ; above this, and also above the amalgam, a layer,

also about 1 cm. in thickness, of zinc-sulphate crystals, and the vessel is
filled up with the saturated zinc sulphate solution.

The zinc-sulphate crystals are obtained by evaporating at a tem-

perature of less than 30° C. some of the zinc-sulphate solution prepared

as in 4 of the specification.

     The stopper is then inserted, leaving a small air bul^ble above the
liquid, and sealed on the outside with shellac dissolved in alcohol.

     The ends of the platinum wires outside the cell forua the two poles,
and should be connected to suitable terminals.

--The Application of Photography to the Elucidation of Meteoroloqienl
     Phenomena. Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of' Mr.
     G. J. Symons (Chairman), Professor R. Meldola, Mr. J.
    HoPKiNSON, a7id Mr. A. W. Clayden (Secretary). (Braivn up hi/

       the Secretary.)

In presenting their report on the work of the last year your Committee
have but little to say on the subject of the representation of clouds and
lightning by photography. They consider that their collection is nearly

complete so far as the different varieties of cloud form are concerned, and

it is only likely to be increased slowly and at long intervals by photo-
graphs of scarce forms of clouds or by particularly interesting series.

During the year the Secretary has secured many new negatives but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

since the collection already includes satisfactory examples of the same

types, it has not been thought desirable to add more duplicates, and the

offers of co-operation from other photographers have not been fulfilled.

With regard to photographs of lightning also the collection has not been

increased, for your Committee have not been made aware of any such

photographs which show any features not already familiar, and no
opportunity has occurred for the Secretary to make any observations for
the further elucidation of the known phenomena.

     Your Committee propose to invite the Royal Meteorological Society

to take charge of such photographs from their collection as are not likely
to be required for further investigation.

The attention of the Committee has been drawn to another application

of photography which seems to open up a possibility of very valuable
work
                    ;  this  is in  the  measurement of  cloud altitudes.  This is a question

which has become more important since the acceptance by the Munich
--144 REPORT 1894.

Congress of the system of cloud nomenclature devised by Hildebrandsson
and Abercromby, and it is remarkable that so few actual measurements
have been carried out.

     So far as your Committee are aware, the only measurements of the
kind which have been systematically organised, at least in this country,
are those which were begun some years ago at Kew.

    Now it is not only important to have more observations, but it is

especially desirable to have them from other places than the vicinity of
London for comparison, and in the residence of the Secretary at Exeter
.such an opportunity is presented.

     In the course of experiments on methods of cloud photography it has
been found easy to secure well-defined images of clouds even when the
sun is in the middle of the field of view. If, then, two such photographs
are taken simultaneously by a pair of cameras at some distance apart,
there will be a displacement of the image relatively to that of the sun.
The amount of this displacement will depend upon a number of things,
but it will be increased by adding to the focal length of the lens and by

increasing the distance between the two cameras. By knowing these

values and the altitude and azimuth of the sun, the distance of the cloud

and its height above the ground may be calculated without diflBculty.
    The azimuth and altitude of the sun at the time of exposure may be

ascertained by direct observation, or it may be found by calculation, from
the known time at which exposure was made. There seems to be a

manifest advantage in thus using the sun as a fixed point of reference,
since it provides a means whereby any error in the observation of altitude

and azimuth may be effectively checked.
     Your Committee have therefore prepared a pair of cameras so con-

structed that they may be easily directed towards the sun. They are

provided with lenses of 18 inches focus covering a plate of whole plate
size, thereby giving a large displacement and allowing room for a displace-
ment of several inches. The lenses are provided with adjustable shutters,
which can be simultaneously freed by an electrical attachment. They are

placed on stands, which serve as cupboards for them when not in use.
    At present for purely trial purposes they are placed in the Secretary's

garden at a distance of 35 yards, yet even that short distance gives a
displacement of half an inch with clouds 3,780 feet distant. This, of
course, is too small for very accurate measurement, and would be far
smaller with high-level clouds, the determination of the altitudes of which
is most important.

     The intention of your Committee is to place them on a plot of level
ground by the side of the London and South-Western Railway near
Exeter. There is available a strip of waste ground, just over a quarter of
a mile in length, commanding an uninterrupted view of the sun from
sunrise until nearly sunset. The ground is level, and the cameras can be
placed due east and west, thereby greatly simplifying the reduction of
the observations. The directors of the London and South-Western Rail-
way have kindly consented to allow the ground to be used under conditions
which seem to your Committee quite satisfactory, but which involve the
payment of a nominal rent of 11. per annum ; and the cameras would
have been placed in position by the present time had it not been necessary
to get another meeting of the Committee to sanction the agreement. The
method is easy to apply, and promises to yield results at leas^ as accurate
as any which have yet been tried ; so your Committee ask for reappoint-

ment, with a grant of 10^.

R. Copeland                                                                 158

             2Ir. H. Darwin^ Bifilar Pendulum.

The preliminary trial of the bifilar pendulum last year led to the dis-

covery of one or two possible sources of error, chiefly resulting from altera-

tions in the distribution of temperature near the instrument. In order to

eliminate these as far as possible, Mr. Darwin has made several changes in

the latest form of the pendulum.'

    When the gas-jet was kept burning for some time, it was found

that the expansion of the tube produced an apparent tilting to the east,

i.e., away from the source of heat. As soon as the flow of heat through

the instrument became nearly steady, a far more considerable movement

of the mirror in the opposite direction became evident, which was perhaps

due to the action of convection currents in the surrounding oil.

     The expansion of the tube is greatest on the side towai-ds the gas-jet.

Its disturbing effect is therefore a maximum when the gas-jet is in a plane

at right angles to that in which the silver wire lies. In the new instrument

the mirror is held in a frame so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicu-

lar to that of the silver wire, and the principal effect of the expansion is

merely an inappreciable change in the sensitiveness of the pendulum. At

the same time we should expect that this method of mounting the mirror

would diminish the disturbing action of convection currents, as the surface

exposed to them lies chiefly in a plane at right angles to that in which the

movements of the ground are being measured.

     In order to avoid any straining of the tube the lever used in deter-
mining the angular value of the scale divisions is prolonged above the

tilting- screw. To this upper portion is attached a movable weight, which

can be adjusted so that the centre of gravity of the lever coincides with

the axis of the tilting-screw. The lever is moved by a rocking-arm worked

from a distance by a pair of pneumatic bellows.

The instrument rests on three foot-screws, two of which are in a line
Aparallel to the plane of the silver wire.
                                             tangent-screw is connected

with these two, so that one can be raised and the other depressed by an

Aequal amount, and so enable the sensitiveness to be varied.      second

tangent-screw is attached to the third foot-screw, or ' back-leg,' by means

    ' For the account of these improvements I am indebted to notes supplied by Mr.

Darwin. See also a paper, « Bifilar Pendulum for Measuring Earth-tilts ,' Nature

of which the pendulum can be tilted in the plane perpendicular to that of

the silver wire, and the spot of light readjusted to the centre of the scale
or photographic paper. Both screws are worked from a distance by long

wooden rods.

   A bifilar pendulum, with the changes above described, was erected

early this year at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. The instrument is
also further pi'otected by a cover from heat effects. Dr. Copeland, As-
tronomer Royal for Scotland, informs me that, with these arrangements,
it is not at all affected by momentary changes of temperature.

      The Greek Earthquake Pulsations of April 1894.

On April 20 a severe earthquake took place in north- east Greece,

causing much damage in several towns and villages. Soon after the news
of its occurrence was published I made frequent observations with the
bifilar pendulum at Birmingham, and was fortunate enough to watch the

o-reater part of the remarkable series of pulsations proceeding from the

Ansecond great disturbance, that of April 27.  account of these move-

ments is given in its proper place below.

   A few weeks later I received from Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz a list of

the records of the same pulsations made by the horizontal pendulum at

Nicolaiew. As these gave a somewhat greater velocity for the pulsations,

it seemed possible that conclusions of some interest might result from an

endeavour to trace the pulsations as they spread outwards from their

origin. I accordingly wrote to the directors of the leading magnetic and

geodynamic observatoi'ies on the Continent and in this country, and I am
indebted to their courtesy for much information, a summary of which is

given below. Additional details I'elating to the Italian observatories have

been extracted from the valuable ' Bollettino Meteorico ' (Supplementi 104

and 105) of the ' Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia e Geodinamica ' of Rome.
     The total number of shocks belonging to this earthquake series must

amount to several hundred. The strongest were those, already mentioned,

on April 20 and 27. Both were felt over the whole of Greece. The

epicentral areas seem to have been situated in the eparchy of Locris, and

probably not far distant from its capital, Atalante. In the estimates of

the velocity which follow I have supposed the earthquake pulsations to
start from this town, the position of which is 38° 39' N. lat., 23° 0' E. long.,

and about 98 kilometres from Athens. For convenience the recorded
times have all been reduced to Greenwich mean time.

began, and at 7h. 49m. 49s. in the N.E.-S.W. component. These large

oscillations had a period of 7 '2 seconds, and present a principal maximum in

the N.E.-S.W. component at 7h. 50in. 40s., that of the other component not

being well defined. This great undulatory movement ceased at 7h. 57m. 20s.

in the N.E.-S.W. component, and at about 8h. 2m. 20s. in the S.E.-N.W.

component.

April 20, beginning of the movement about 5h. 20m. 20s. p.m. in the
N.W.-S.E. component, about 5h. 22m. Os. in the JST.E.-S.W. component.

The movement gradually increased until the following maxima were pre-

sented : 5h. 25m. 35s., 5h. 26m. Os., 5h. 26m. 55s. (principal maximum),

5h. 28m. 20s., 5h. 29m. Os., after which the traces irregularly and slowly

decreased, the end of the movement taking place at about 5h. 33m. 15s.
in the N.W.-S.E. component, and about 5h. 35m. 10s. in the N.E.-S.W.

component. April 27, the beginning of the movement in both components

at about 7h. 47m. 50s. p.m. ; a series of maxima, first increasing and
then decreasing, at 7h. 50m. 55s., 7h. 51m. 40s. (principal maximum),

gradually increased in amplitude until they attained the following

maxima : between oh. 25m. 40s. and 5h. 26m. 40s. (two principal

maxima), at 5h. 26m. 58s., 5h. 28m. 4s., and 5h. 28m. 40s. ; the
oscillations then slowly disappeared, the total duration being about fifteen

minutes. During the first seven minutes the average period of the oscil-

lations in the E.iS.E.-W.N.W. component was about five seconds, and in

the other, during the first ten minutes, about four seconds. At about

5h. 49m. 40s. there was a group of fourteen small oscillations, lasting for
one minute. April 27, about 7h. 47m. 40s. p.m., beginning of the oscil-

lations,  which  increased   suddenly  in  amplitude                                                 the                       first  maximum  at

7h. 51m., after which there were four others, the principal maximum

being at 7h. 53m. 6s. During an interval of 552 seconds sixty-five oscil-
lations were counted in the N.N.E.-S.S.W. component, and sixty-one in
the E.S.E.-W.N.W. component, giving an average period of eight and a

half seconds for each complete oscillation.

    Kew (Mr. C. Chree), 51° 38' 6" N., 0° 18 47" W. ' There is a very

small but unmistakable movement in the horizontal force curve, and a
simultaneous extremely slight suggestion of a movement in the declina-
tion curve. Careful measurements give 8h. Om. p.m. as the mean Green-
wich time of the middle of the movement on the horizontal force curve,
and 7h. 59m. p.m. as that for the declination curve. There is not the

faintest trace of movement in the vertical force curve.'

    Birmingham, 52° 28' N., 1° 54' W. The pulsations were first seen on

April 27 at 7h. 59m. p.m. Between 8h. Im. and 8h. 3m. 20s. the image passed

the cross wire twenty times, giving an average duration of 14 seconds for
each oscillation. Between 8h. 8m. and 8h. 10m. 2s. the same number of
oscillations was completed, the average duration of each being 12-2 seconds.
The amplitude was determined by adjusting the image of the disc of light
so that at one limit of its movement its edge coincided with the cross-

wire of the telescope. At 7h. 59m. the range was equal to three-quarters
of the diameter of the disc. The whole diameter, it was afterwards found,

is equivalent to 0-98 inch of the scale, so that the trace of the disturbance

on a photographic recording apparatus in the same position as the scale

would have been 18 mm. in breadth. As the angular value of the scale-

divisions had not been ascertained since the beginning of August 1893 a

new determination was made on the evenings of May 16-18. The mean

of twenty-four pairs of tilts of 2" is 6-66 ±-08 inches of the scale. Thus,

at 7h. 59m. the range was 0"-22. After this I believe it slightly increased

until 8h. 2m. or 8h. 3m. At 8h. 5m. it was 0"-16. It then rapidly and

almost continually diminished, being 0"-ll at 8h. S^m., 0"-08 at 8h. 7m.,

0"-05 at 8h. 8m., and 0"-03 at 8h. 12m. The movement then became so
small that it could only be estimated. It was about 0"-01 at 8h. 14m.,

0"-005 at 8h. 16m. At 8h. 17m. there was a single oscillation of 0"-015.
From 8h. 18m. to 8h. 19m. the image was steady, but at the latter time

the range suddenly increased to 0"-03, but diminished after a few oscilla-
tions, until at 8h. 28m. the image was steady again. After this time no

movement so great as 0"-003 could with any certainty be detected.^

      In addition to the above records it should be stated that the magnetic

curves on April 27 have been examined at the following observatories

with a negative result : Coimbra, Greenwich, Lisbon, Madrid, Nantes,

Nice, and Stonyhurst.
     The difference between the distances of Athens and Wilhelmshaven

from Atalante is 1,910 km., and the difference between the recorded times
at the same places is about 12m. 55s. on April 20, and about 10m. 9s. on
April 27. Assuming that these times correspond to the same phase of

the disturbance, we obtain 2-46 and 3-14 km. per second respectively for

the average velocities on these days. These give : -

Time at epicentrum on April 20 = 5h. IGm. 25s. p.m., G.M.T.
                                  ,, 27 = 7h. 45m. 40s. P.M. ,,

Using these values of the initial time, we have the following table :

     ' Owing to the lag of the mirror through the oil these estimates are probably

less than the actual amounts. When the frame of the pendulum is tilted suddenly

through an angle of 2", the image at first moves quickly, but during the first

15 seconds not more than half its total deflection is accomplished.

       The values of the velocity in this table have been obtained on the

 supposition that all phases of the disturbance left the origin simul-
  taneously at the initial times given above. This is of course in the

 highest degree improbable, but it was so taken in the absence of any
 certainty as to which phase corresponded to these times. It is evident

 that the discordances between many of the above results must in a great

 measure be due to tliis assumption. For instance, on April 27, the
 beginning of the pulsations was registered at Charkow one minute sooner
 than at Nicolaiew, though the former place is 460 km. further from the
 epicentrum. Both stations being observatories, the explanation appears
 to be that the pendulum at Charkow was affected by earlier pulsations of

  smaller amplitude.'

      The most probable estimate of the velocity is, I believe, that derived
 from the epochs of the beginning of the larger pulsations. Including
 those obtained from magnetographs, which are not disturbed by the small
 initial movements, we have the following results ^ for the mean velocity :

                                          April 20. 2-08 ± -08 km. per sec.

                                Future Work of the Committee.

      The grant of 50Z. awarded last year to the Committee has been spent
 in providing for the foundation, &c., of the bifilar pendulum at Bir-
 mingham, and (in part) for one of the improved pendulums with photo-
 graphic recording apparatus, to be placed in that city under the charge of

 the Secretary.

      The Committee consider that it would be desirable to test the working
of the pendulum by placing another of similar construction at a short
distance from it. The comparison would probably be made for a year,
and the second instrument would afterwards be available for use else-
where. They accordingly request that they be reappointed, with a grant

of 100^.

it follows that either (1) the instrument there was only affected by the larger
oscillations, or (2) that the rapid vibrations which constitute the earthquake shock
were distinct from the pulsations, and that the former alone were registered. The
initial times above given were obtained on the supposition that the former alterna-
tive is correct. It seems possible, however, that the pulsations are not merely the

distant equivalent of the shock, but that they may travel with a diflferent, and pro-
bably greater, velocity. If this be the case, the estimates of the velocity may be

a little too great.
      ' If the velocity of the pulsations is independent of their amplitude, these

small pulsations must have left the origin more than sis minutes before the larger
ones (as if the earth's crust slowly quivered before giving way), and might possibly
be utilised for giving earthquake warnings (see Professor Mikie's suggestion in

Seismol. Journ., vol. i. 1893, pp. 10-15).

     ^ The first of these is calculated from six observations (Nos. 11, 14, 25, 27,
31, 33), the second from thirteen observations (Nos. 8, 11, 14, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32. 33,
36,37,38.41).

                               APPENDIX I.

 Account of Observations made with the Horizontal Pendulum at Nicolaiew.^
                                By Professor S. Kortazzi.

      More than a year has elapsed since I began to make observations
 with the pendulum of M. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz installed in the cellar
 of the observatory, but I have not as yet published any detailed reports on

 this subject, with the exception of a brief account given at one of the

 meetings of the Astronomical Society at St. Petersburg. . . . The more
 or less regular oscillations of the pendulum, as well as the abrupt per-
 turbations which it often experiences, depend on several physical agents,
 and I find it necessary to continue the series of observations for several
 months to be in a position to obtain from them more or less sound results.

       For the present I can only draw some general conclusions :

      (1) The horizontal pendulum may be used as a very sensible and very

 trustworthy seismograph, which does not fail to record all the oscillations
 of the ground and tremors of the earth's crust, even in the case of very
 distant earthquakes. Comparing the results obtained here with those at

 Strassburg during the first three months of this year, we find more than
 a dozen disturbances registered at the same time by both instruments.

      (2) Different seismic disturbances produce extremely varied move-

 ments of the pendulum. On the enclosed copy of the photograph, which

 registers the positions from April 3, 8h., to April 9, 7h., are shown two
 feeble disturbances on April 4 at 22h. 40m. and April 6, 5-5h., and a
 very strong one on April 8 at 4-Oh. The latter corresponds to the earth-
quake wliich took place at this time in Servia and Southern Hungary.
 For three-quarters of an hour the pendulum was very strongly disturbed

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

 it even changed abruptly its normal position ; and it was only at 6h. that
 it became steady, whilst no one in the whole country felt then the least

movement of the ground. On August 17, however, at 4|h. mean time,

a rather pronounced eartliquake occurred at Nicolaiew itself, and was
observed by a great number of the inhabitants, whilst the pendulum only
experienced a feeble disturbance similar to that shown on the curve on
April 6 at 10-5h. (but much more feeble), when the pendulum was
purposely disturbed by a feeble current of air under its cover.

     (3) The pendulum is subject to periodic diurnal and annual oscilla-
tions. The amplitude of the former does not on an average exceed 0"-l,

whilst that of the latter attains 3" or 4". These last changes may be

explained by the inclination of the upper layers of the ground produced
by the annual changes of temperature at the depth of the pillar ; whilst
the diurnal oscillations, it seems to me, cannot be explained in the same
way, because not only the ground at the depth of 15 feet, at which the
pillar of the pendulum is founded, but even the air of the cellar, does not

experience any changes of temperature throughout the day. On the

enclosed copy the diurnal oscillations are shown very distinctly.

    In my letter of August ^f, 1893, I pointed out the three principal

kinds of movement which the horizontal pendulum experiences : (1) the

             March 21-22, 1894.       which M. de Rebeur-Paschwitz

                                      the diurnal deviations ; and (3)

                                      seismic disturbances. To these must

                                      be added (4) disturbances during
                                      storms, probably arising from the

                                      movement of the building, produc-

                                      ing tremors in the ground ; and

                                      (5) periodic deviations of short
                                      period, in all probability of seismic

                                      origin.

                                           The deviations (1) are shown
                                      in the continual movement of the

                                      pendulum in the same direction,,

                                      with slight digressions, lasting

                                      several months, apparently during

                                      the transition from winter to sum-

                                      mer, and vice versd. In the present

                                      position of my instrument the pen-

                                      dulum inclines towards the south in

                                      spring and summer, and towards

                                      the north in winter. . . . Here I
                                      must remark that the amplitude of

                                      the annual changes of temperature

                                      in the cellar where the instrument

                                      is placed does not exceed 6° R.

                                      (13°-5 F.), whilst the changes of the

                                      diurnal period are quite insensible.

                                      In fig. 4 are seen two seismic

                                      disturbances on March 21-22, 1894.

                                      The second of these (beginning at
                                      Oh. 43m. Nicolaiew mean time)'

     Lastly 6ti«-. (1 mm.=0"-025) serves to illustrate the deviations (5),
when the' pendulum, without being agitated, is never at rest, but for

several hours inclines sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the other.

During the month of March, 1894, such disturbances frequently occurred.

      Fig. 6.-- Disturbances of Short Period (probably seismic) on March 5, 1894

    On the whole, the observations of the horizontal pendulum may be of
much service in studying the different movements of the earth's crust and

of the ground.

    Amongst other things it seems to me difficult to explain the oscilla-

tions of the diurnal period observed here, as well as at Potsdam, &c., by
M. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, and at Charkow by Professor Lewitzky, since
the temperature and relative humidity of the air in the neighbourhood of
the instrument remain constant throughout the day.

    Havin«^ at my disposal an almost uninterrupted series of observations

for fifteen months in the same position of the instrument (the axis of the

pendulum in the prime vertical), I wished to investigate if the moon

produced any influence on these oscillations. For this purpose I divided
the whole series into sixty successive groups, corresponding to the different
phases of the moon, from which I have drawn the conclusion that the
influence of the moon is insensible, or, if it exists, that it is masked by
the different accidental disturbances. After this, having divided the
whole series into five consecutive parts (three lunar months in each), I
have obtained the following table of the deviations of the pendulum from
its mean position for every two hours (astronomical time) in thousandths

of a second ' (0"-001) :--

     --
158 REPORT-- 1894.

   We see, therefore, that the amplitude of the deviations is greatest

during the summer months. It will be remarked that the first and last
series, corresponding nearly to the same times of the year, give almost

identical deviations.

                      APPENDIX II.

      The Bifilar Pendulum at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.
By Professor R. Copeland, F.R.S.E., Astronomer Royal for Scotland.

This instrument was placed in position by Mr. H. Darwin on

March 23, 1894. It is, with slight exceptions, similar to the instrument
erected at Birmingham, in April 1893, for Mr. C. Davison, and which

has been fully described in the British Association Report for 1893,

pp. 291-303. The exceptions referred to are : (1) the arrangement of the
mirror of the Edinburgh instrument at right angles to the plane of the

suspending wires, and (2) the surrounding of the instrument by a heavy
casing to prevent, as far as possible, any movement of the mirror due to

change of temperature resulting from the lighting of the illuminating

lamp or other cause.

The whole apparatus, including the scale and lamp, is placed in a hut

erected for the purpose over a trench running east and west, formed

within the Observatory grounds by removing the soil and levelling the

Arock.  hole 2 feet deep is bored in the rock near the west end of the

trench, and into this is leaded the heavy iron supporting bar. This bar

is 1^ inch in diameter, and projects above the surface of the rock suf-

ficiently far to allow the iron plate carrying the instrument to be fixed to

Ait by screws.  slate slab 18 inches square and 1^ inch thick, in which

a circular hole is cut 9^ inches in diameter, is placed round the iron

plate, but not touching it, and is supported on a wooden frame at the

level of the plate. On this slate is placed a square cast-iron casing,

6^ inches deep, which surrounds the body of the instrument, including

the mirror-box. On this, again, rests a second slate with a circular hole,

6^ inches in diameter, through which passes the head of the instrument
and the upper part of the brass tube containing the fi'ame. The head is

covered by a stoneware jar resting on the upper slate.

The cast-iron casing surrounding the body of the instrument is

perforated by an aperture 4^: inches in diameter opposite the mirror-
window. To prevent undue access of air, and consequent dewing of the

window, a truncated cone of sheet copper is fastened inside this aperture,

with its smaller end turned inwards towards the instrument. In spite of

this precaution, liowever, much difi&culty has been experienced from the

dewing of the glass, and a wooden shutter lined with green baize has

been arranged to still further prevent the circulation of air. The shutter

is raised when necessary by pulling a string from the east end of the hut.

In addition vessels containing chloride of calcium have been placed in

the hut and inside the cast-iron casing. Much benefit has been derived

from these arrangements. The casing is also perforated with holes to

admit the handles of the tangent screws and the pipes of the bellows

used for ascertaining the number of divisions of the scale correspond-

ing to a known tilt of the instrument. In both cases provision has been

made for preventing tremor being conveyed to the instrument by the use

of these parts of the apparatus, the whole of such tremor being taken up

by the casing.

    The scale and small benzoline illuminating lamp are placed at the

Aeast end of the hut.     frame, supported in a horizontal position by two

strong iron feet fixed by beds of cement laid on the rock, is traversed by

the lamp-stand, which carries an index along the edge of the scale. The

readings are taken when the image of a wire placed vertically in front of

a circular hole in the lamp- screen coincides with the vertical wire in a

fixed theodolite. The scale is divided into millimetres, and the effective

length of it traversed by the index is 382 mm., and it is distant 10 feet

=( 3,048 mm.) from the centi-e of the instrument. If I be the distance of

the lamp from the point of the scale which is due east of the mirror,

the azimuth, north or south of east, of the normal to the mirror is

·i tan"'        . "When ^=191 this becomes 1° 47' 3.5'', and represents

          304o

the rotation of the miri'or to each side of the north and south position

within the range of the scale. When the rotation exceeds this amount

the mirror has to be brought back to its north and south position by

turning the long handle attached to the southern levelling screw.

    The plane of the suspending wire is in the east and west direction

with the longer section of the wire toward the east ; consequently, as the

face of the mirror is towai'ds the east, a tilt of the upper support of the

wire towards the north produces a corresponding deflection of the normal

to  the mirror  also  to  the  north                          hence tilts  in the  north  and  south

direction only are measured by the instrument.

    From measures of the dimensions of the instrument which have been

supplied by Mr. Horace Darwin, it is computed that the movement of

the lever, attached to the micrometer screw against which the top of

the frame is pressed, through the fixed amount of 13 mm. for which the

apparatus is set, produces a tilt of 2-016 seconds of arc in the upper

support of the suspending wire. As soon as the pendulum was mounted

experiments were made to ascertain its sensitiveness, or the scale value of

this fixed amount of tilt. The mean of nine measures taken on March 26

gave 62'4 mm. of the scale ^= 2"'016. This was considered excessive,

and steps were taken to reduce it gradually. The mean of four measures

made between May 5 and 8 gave 21 '2 mm. -- 2"'016. Since the last of

these dates the two levelling screws, whose combined movement alters

the sensitiveness, have not been interfered with. Observations of the

sensitiveness have, however, been made occasionally, four measures

between May 16 and June 9 giving 19*3 mm., 17'2 mm., 20'0 mm., and

23'7 mm. respectively, or an average of 20*0 mm., equal to 2"-016. Since

June 9 four measures have been made, but these give somewhat anomalous

and as yet unexplained results.

    In the absence of any photographic arrangement for giving a con-

tinuous record of the position of the mirror, it has been decided to take

readings at each full minute from five minutes before to five minutes

after Paris mean noon every day. This has been carried out from

May 26 up to the present time, with the exception of a few days, when

the readings were rendered impossible by a deposit of moisture on the

mirror window or other cause. These observations were made by Mr.

T. Heath and Mr. A. J. Ramsay.

    On no occasion has any unsteadiness or oscillation of the mirror been
--160 REPORT 1894,

observed, though a slight change of position appears to take place during
the time of observation, owing possibly to the presence of the observer or
the heat of the lamp. This change, however, is very slight, and the

mean of the eleven observations of each set is taken as showing the
position of the mirror for that day at Paris noon. These mean scale
readings have been laid on a curve with the date as one argument and
the divisions of the scale as the other. The result shows that the mirror

has been constantly turning in azimuth from the east towards the north
during the whole period over which the observations have extended

(May 26 to July 31). The total amount of this movement has been
517 mm. on the scale in sixty-six days, or an angular rotation of 9° 37' 23"
for the ray falling on the mirror from the lamp ; which is, of course,

equivalent to an angular rotation of 4° 48' 42" in the mirror itself.

     If, now, 20 mm. (^2"*016) be taken as the sensitiveness of the instru-

--ment over all this time though about this number there is some uncer-
--tainty the total tilt of the instrument towards the north appears to have

been fifty-two seconds of arc in sixty-six days. The stability of the nadir-
point of the mural circle in the adjoining observatory proves that this tilt
must either be in the superficial layer of the rock to which the instrument
is attached or, which is far more probable, in the pendulum itself.

     The experiments confirm the results obtained elsewhei'e, that the
instrument, while unfitted to show the slower progressive tilts of the
earth's surface, is pre-eminently suited, by its great sensitiveness and
momentary stability, for the indication of earth tremors. However, to
bring out the full powers of the apparatus it is obviously necessary to
secure a continuous photographic record of the position of the mirror.

     M. Antoine d'Abbadie, at whose cost the pendulum was supplied, has

caused simultaneous observations to be taken with his ' nadirane ' at
Abbadia in north latitude 43° 22''8 and longitude 7m. Os. west of Green-
wich. The readings at the two stations have, however, not yet been com-
pared.

--The Electrolytic Methods of Qxiantitative Analysis. Report of the

     Committee, consisting] of Professor J, Emerson Reynolds (Chair-

    man), Dr. C. A. KoHN (Secretary), Professor P. Frankland,
    Professor F. Clowes, Dr. Hugh Marshall, Mr. A. E. Fletcher,

     Mr, D. H. Nagel, Mr. T, Turner, and Mr, J. B. Coleman,

The first work undertaken by the Committee has been the compilation

of the bibliography of the subject, with which some progress has been
made.

     In addition, the plan on which the experimental part of the work is
to be carried out has been arranged. This is to include the investigation
of the methods for the determination of the following metals : silver,
lead, mercury, bismuth, cadmium, tin, antimony, iron, zinc, manganese

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and subsequently of the methods for the separation of these metals both
from one another and from other metals.

     This is all the Committee undertook to do when they were appointed

without a grant of money.

     They now ask to be reappointed and with a grant of 40^.

     ON THE JBIBLIOGRArnV OF SrECTROSCOPY.

--Bihliorjraphii of Specfroscopi/. Report of the Committee, considing of

    Professor H. McLeod, Professor W. C. Roberts Austen, Mr. H.

     G. Madan, and Mr. D. H. Nagel.

The work of searching for, and arranging chronologically under proper

heads, the titles of papers on subjects relating to spectroscopy has been
proceeded with by the Committee, and a list is appended which brings the
catalogue of spectroscopic literature up to the beginnmg of 1894.

     It will be a subject for consideration whether the reappointment of
the Committee would be advisable. Considerable difficulty arises in find-

inf any one who can gratuitously devote sufficient time to the work of
obtaining and verifying references to papers, and who possesses at the
same time the requisite facilities for doing so.

     In the meantime, however, the Committee ask to be reappointed for
one more year.

           ON STANDARDS FOR THE ANALYSTS OF IRON AND STEEL. 237

--An International Standard for the Analysis of Iron and Steel.

     Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. C.

     Roberts-Austen (Chairman), Sir F. Abel, Mr. E. Riley,.

     Mr. J. Si'iLLER, Professor J. W. Langley, Mr. G. J. Snelus,

     Professor Tilden, and Mr. Thomas Turner (Secretary). (Draivn
      up hy the Secretary.)

In the previous report of this Committee it was stated that the work of
the British analysts was completed, so far as the four original standards
were concerned, and that the results of the analyses conducted by the
other Committees were in good agreement with those published by this
Committee.

     The remaining standard. No. 5, has now been analysed by Messrs.

G. S. Packer, J. Pattinson, E. Riley, and J. E. Stead, and the results of

 their investigations are as follows :

 238 REPORT-- 1894.

--272,6 Action of Light upon Dyed Colours. Report of the Committee,

       consisting of Professor T. E. Thorpe (Chairmcm), Professor J. J.

     Hummel {Secretary), Dr. W. H. Perkin, Professor W. J. Russell,
     Captain W. DE W. Abney, Professor W. Stroud, and Professor

       R. Meldola. (Brawn up by the Secretary.)

 During the past year the work of this Committee has been continued,
 and a large number of wool and silk patterns, dyed with various natural
 and artificial orange and yellow colouring matters, have been examined
 with respect to their power of resisting the fading action of light.

      The general method of preparing the dyed patterns, and the manner
 of exposing them under glass, with free access of air and moisture, were
 the same as already adopted.

      The patterns were exposed at Adel, near Leeds, in the grounds of

 James A. Hirst, Esq., to whom the best thanks of the Committee are

 again due for his kind permission to do so.
      Each dyed pattern was divided into six pieces, one of which was

 protected from the action of light, while the others were exposed for

different periods of time. These ' periods of exposure ' were made equivalent
 to those adopted last year, by exposing, along with the patterns, special
 series of ' standards,' dyed with the same colouring matters as were then
 selected for this purpose. The standards were allowed to fade to the
 same extent as those which marked off the ' fading period ' of last year,
 before being renewed or removing a set of dyed patterns from the action
of light. The patterns exposed during the past year are therefoi-e
comparable, in respect of the amount of fading which they have ex-

perienced, with the red dyes already reported upon.
      The patterns were all put out for exposure on June S, 1893, certain

--sets being subsequently removed on the following dates : July 1, July 31,

August 26, 1893 ; February 19, June 12, 1894. Of the five 'periods of
exposure' thus marked oflT, periods 1, 2, 3 were equivalent to each other
in fading power, whereas periods 4 and 5 were each equivalent to four of
the first period in this respect ; hence five patterns of each colour have
been submitted respectively to an amount of fading equal to 1, 2, 3, 7,

--and 11 times that of the first 'fading period' selected viz. June 8 to

July 1, 1893.
      The dyed and faded patterns have again been entered in pattern-card

books in such a manner that they can be readily comjiared with each other.
      The following tables give the general result of the exposure experi-

ments made during the year 1893-94, the colours being divided, according

to their behaviour towards light, into the following five classes : very
fugitive, fugitive, modei-ately fast, fast, very fast.

     The initial numbers refer to the order of the patterns in the pattern-
books. The S. and J. numbers refer to Schultz and Julius's 'Tabel-

larische Uebersicht der kiinstlichen organischen FarbstoflTen.'

     The colours marked thus (*) appear to be somewhat faster than the
rest of the class in which they are placed.

     In the case of colouring matters requii'ing mordants, the particular

mordant employed is indicated in brackets after the name of the dye-

stuff".

          Class I. Very Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class have faded so rapidly that at the end of the
first 'fading period' (June 8 to July 1, 1893) only a very faint colour

remains, or it has become very materially altered in hue. At the end of

the fifth period (one year) all traces of the original colour have disap-
peared, the woollen cloth being either quite white or merely of a yellowish

or brownish tint.

  --Notes. Certain of the nitro colours show extreme sensitiveness to

light by rapidly altering in hue. During the first 'period of exposure,' the
rich red-orange colour of Aui'antia, for example, soon changes to brown,
and the pure lemon-yellow of Picric Acid changes to orange-yellow ; in
both cases these altered colours fade slowly without any further change
in hue, and might almost be placed among the ' moderately fast colours.'
Brilliant Yellow, Martius Yellow, and Naphthol Yellow S behave some-
what like Picric Acid, but the alteration in hue is much less pronounced.

Thiazol Yellow, Mimosa YeUow, Thioflavin T and S, and Primulin all fade

rapidly during the iirst ' period of exposure ' to a yellow-buff, which then
appears to be ' moderately fast.'

                         Class II Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show very marked fading at the end of the
second 'fading period ' (July 1 to July 31, 1893), and after a year's
exposure they have entirely faded, or only a tint remains.

--Notes. The fugitive character of Narcein as compared with Orange

II., of which it is merely the sodium bisulphite compound, is very pro-

nounced. The bright orange of Flavin with tin mordant changes rapidly

during the first exposing period to an olive-yellow, which may be regarded

Aas ' moderately fast.'  similar change is noticed in the case of Quercitron.

Bark and Old Fustic with the same mordant, the faded colour of the

latter being, however, very dull.

With aluminium and tin mordants Anthracine gives bright but very

fugitive colours.

       Class III. Moderately Fast Colours. (Wool.)

The colours of this class show distinct fading at the end of the second

period (July 1 to July 31, 1893), which becomes more pronounced at the

Aend of the third period (July 31 to August 26, 1893).      pale tint re-

mains at the end of the fourth ' period of exposure ' (August 26, 1893, to

February 19, 1894), and at the end of a year's exposure the colour has

entirely faded, or, at most, mere traces of colour remain.

  --Notes. The following colours become somewhat duller and apparently-
--darker during the first and second periods of exposure : Diphenylamine

Orange, Metanil Yellow, Fast Yellow N, Azo-flavin S, Acid Yellow 00,
and Aurotin. This appearance is only observed when the patterns are
examined ' underhand,' i.e. by looking down into the fabric ; when they
are examined ' overhand,' i.e. by glancing along the surface, a normal
fading of the colours is observed. This darkening is probably due to the
presence of the diphenylamine group in the first four colours mentioned,
and to the presence of the nitro group in the case of Aurotin, of which
the alteration in hue reminds one of the change occurring in Picric Acid
Yellow, though it is less pronounced.

     Mordant Yellow with aluminium and tin mordants gives colours which

may well be classed with the fast colours.

                       Class IV. Fast Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show comparatively little fading during the
first, second, and third periods. At the end of the fourth ' period of ex-

posure ' a pale shade remains, which at the end of the year's exposure still

leaves a pale tint.

--Notes. In Palatine Orange we meet with the fir.st example of a colour

fast  to  light,  the  manufacture  of      which  has  already been abandoned
                                                                                                                                                              ;

possibly some difficulty or e.xpense connected with its manufacture may

account for this circumstance.

    Yellow for wool AF, applied with aluminium mordant, is very fugi-
tive, while Chrome Orange seems quite as fast as with chromium. Chrome
Yellow with aluminium mordant may be classed as a ' moderately ^fast

colour.

     Galioflavin with aluminium and tin mordants gives fugitive colours,

more especially with aluminium.

                          Class V. Very Fast Colours.

     The colours of this class show a very gradual fading during the dif-
ferent periods, and even after a year's exposure a moderately good colour

remains.

mium mordant becomes, during the first 'fading period,' distinctly bluer in

shade, and hence apparently darker ; the altered colour then fades so
slowly that even after a year's exposure the faded colour appears almost

as dark as the original.

The azo colours in this class which have been dyed on chromium mor-

danted wool leave, at the end of a year's exposure, faded colours of greater

body and fulness  than    those  applied without   mordant                                            this  is  no doubt
                                                                                                   ;

due to the inferior fastness of the latter, the faded colours of which are

covered with a thin layer of perfectly bleached fibres.

     All the artificial azo-mordant-colours in this class were fixed with
aluminium as well as chromium mordant, and found to be equally fast to

light. They were also applied with a tin mordant, but only in a few cases
were satisfactory level colours thus obtained, and these seemed to be inferior
to those applied with an aluminium mordant, in point of brilliancy as well

as of fastness to light.

ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT UPON DYED COLOURS.  245

                                              Silk Patterns.

     Most of the foregoing colours were also dyed on silk, and the patterns
were exposed to light along with those on wool. The relative fastness of the
various colours was, for the most part, the same as on wool, the difference?
observed being too unimportant to necessitate a special classification foj

Asilk. In Class IV., Yellow for wool F (Cr.) proved to be much more

fugitive on silk, whereas Chrysamin E, and Gr, Titan Yellow E, and Y,

ROriol, Cresotin Yellow and G, and Chrysophenin appeared to be

somewhat faster. In Class III. the same remark applies to Cotton
Yellow G.

    The Indian dye-stuff Kamala was an additional one applied to silk, and

found to belong to the fugitive class, being very little faster than Annatto.

                                   General Observations.

    The first thing which strikes one when examining these orange and
yellow patterns is the comparatively large number of satisfactorily per-
manent colours.

     In the more or less fugitive class are to be found all the basic colours;
all the nitro-phenols, with the exception of Palatine Orange, and all the
bright yellows derived from the natural colouring matters by means of
aluminium and tin mordants, with the exception of those obtained from
"Weld. Comparatively few azo colours are met with in this group.

     The marked alteration in colour from yellow to orange shown in the
case of Picric Acid has long been known, and is ascribed to a reducing
action of the light. The equally striking change from orange to brown,
shown by Aurantia, does not, however, seem to have been previously

recorded.

    By far the largest number of yellows, ranging from ' moderately fast
to ' very fast,' ai'e to be found among the azo colours. Specially important

are those in which salicylic acid is a constituent element, since not only does
this impai't to the colour the power of foi-ming more or less stable lakes with
chromium and aluminium mordants, but it appears frequently to give the

colours the quality of fastness to light, even when no mordant is applied.
It is a fact of some importance that the colours obtained with aluminium

are practically as fast as those fixed with chromium, since the first-named

mordant gives much brighter and purer yellows. The tin mordant, so useful

in tlie production of the most brilliant orange and yellow colours obtainable
from the natural colouring matters, seems, however, to be of httle or no
advantage in connection with most of these azo-moixlant-colours, no doubt
because they are susceptible to the reducing action of the mordant usually

--employed for wool viz. stannous chloride.

     Very interesting in point of fastness to light are the azoxy colours, and
although unfortunately apt to dye wool somewhat irregularly, giving
speckled-looking colours, they are admirably adapted for silk and

cotton.

     Another interesting little group is that which includes Tartrazin, a
colour not only noteworthy for its fastness to light, but also because of its
brilliancy and purity.

     The fastness of Alizarin Orange is worthy of special mention, for it is
probably greater even than that exhibited by most other colours of the
  246 REPORT-- 1894.

  Alizarin group, and it shows the peculiar darkening action exerted by the
  light, probably in consequence of the presence of the nitro group.

       It is remarkable how few really fast yellows aie derived from the

  natural colouring matters, and these are chiefly the olive-yellows obtained
  with chromium mordant. The only fast, and at the same time bright,
  natural yellows are those derived from Weld, and since this dye-stuff is

  now of little general importance to the dyer its cultivation has become
  extremely limited, and is gradually being given up ; it is fortunate, there-

  fore, that science has been able to replace it by efficient substitutes, so far,
  at least, as permanency towards light is concerned.

       Our experiments have already abundantly proved that the popular
  opinion that the coal tar dye-stuffs include only such as yield more or less

  fugitive colours is entirely false ; indeed, it is perfectly safe to assert that

  coal-tar is the source from which the greatest number of colours fast to
  light are derived at the present time, and this seems to be specially true of
  the red and yellow colours.

--Proximate Chemical Constituents of Coal. Interim Report of the

      Committee, consisting of Sir I. Lo^^THIAN Bell (Chairman), Pro-
      fessor P. Phillips Bedson (Secretarf), Mr. Ludwig Mono, Professor

     Vivian B. Lewes, Professor E. Hull, Mr. J. W. Thomas, and

      Mr. H. Bauerman.

Of the proximate constituents of the organic material forming coal our

knowledge is limited to the demonstrated existence in it of certain gaseous
 hydrocarbons which have been extracted under conditions such as to lead to
 the belief that these gases exist occluded or enclosed in the coal itself.
Further, certain mineral substances (containing carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen) of a more or less defined character have been met with from time
to time in association with coal, and also some few solid hydrocarbons.

     The literature bearing upon this subject is extremely meagre, but it
appears that the action of some solvents on coal has formed the subject of
investigation by several chemists. Ether, alcohol, petroleum ether, benzene,
and phenol have been used as solvents by different observers. The last
named was found by Guignet to dissolve from 2 to 4 per cent, of a brown
amorphous solid from a fat coal. Guignet has also observed that, by the
action of nitric acid on coal, oxalic acid and trinitro-resorcinol are produced

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

further, there are formed insoluble substances, apparently similar to ' nitro-
cellulose,' which explode on heating.
           ON THE PROXIMATE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF COAL. 247

     For the purposes of a preliminary study a coal representing the Hutton
seam in the county of Durham was selected. This coal is a bituminous

coal, and is used as a gas coal. When heated with ether it yields up to

the solvent a small amount of a substance which imparts a light yellow
colour to the ether, and a blue fluorescence is observed, similar to that
noted by Dondorff in his experiments with a gas coal of the Westphalia
Coalfield. Alcohol, benzene, and petroleum ether dissolve but little from
the coal, the solutions being in each case similar to that obtained with

ether.

     Acetic anhydride and glacial acetic acid were employed as solvents
with but little eflfect. Somewhat more promising at first were the results
obtained by using a solution of sulphur dioxide in glacial acetic acid.
The coal was heated at 100° C. with this solution in tightly closed
flasks. The liquid becomes dark in colour, and on adding water to the
solution a light yellow precipitate is formed. The precipitate is dissolved
by ether, and the ethereal solution on evaporation leaves an oily residue,
which was found to be partially volatile in steam.

      Turpentine heated at 150° C. in a tightly closed flask with the
powdered coal dissolves some constituent, becoming darker in colour and
acquiring a greenish-blue fluorescence.

    When the coal is heated with aniline a brown amorphous solid is

dissolved out, which is precipitated from the aniline on acidifying with
Hydrochloric acid. This substance is not unlike that obtained by Guignet
by treatment of coal with phenol. It was attempted to separate this
solid into several fractions by treatment with alcohol and benzene.
The alcoholic and benzene solutions, however, left merely resinous sub-
stances on evaporation. Dilute solutions of potassium permanganate
oxidise this solid, forming dark brown solutions containing potassium
carbonate and the potassium salts of organic acids. The quantity of
material being small, it was next decided to treat the coal itself with
potassium jjermanganate. For this purpose finely powdered coal is sus-
pended in water, to which, when boiling, potassium permanganate is added
in small quantities at a time. The colour of the permanganate gradually
disappears, and an odour resembling that of turpentine is observed ; at the
same time a dark brown alkaline liquid is formed.

     The amount of permanganate which is thus reduced by the coal is
considerable : in one case where 500 grams of coal were taken, some 1,600
grams of permanganate were employed without exhausting the reducing
power of the coal, of which some 25 to 30 per cent, had been oxidised in
this manner.

     The aqueous solution decanted off from the manganese dioxide and
coal is very dark in colour, becoming almost black when concentrated.

     Amongst the acids formed in this way, oxalic acid has been found,
together with some deliquescent acids, which on the evaporation of their
aqueous solutions are left as brown resinous masses. The separation of
these products is still incomplete, and it would be futile to give the results
of the analyses of the salts which have been prepared. The barium salts
appear to afford a means of separating the acids, some of which salts have
been already obtained in a fairly pure condition. The account of these
acids and the study of the action of potassium permanganate on other

coals it is proposed to deal with in a subsequent report.

--Isomeric Naphthalene Derwatives. Eighth Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Professor W. A. Tilden and Professor H. E. Arm-

     strong. {Brawn up by Professor Armstrong.)

   --The Conversion of Sulphochlorides into the corresponding Chloro-

derivatives. In the case of naphthalene derivatives no interaction is of

greater practical importance than that which occurs when sulphochlorides
are heated with phosphorus pentachloride, whereby they are converted
into chloro-derivatives. At one time it was argued that reliance could
not be placed on this interaction as a means of determining constitu-
tion, but of late years no such objection has been raised, and the idea
that isomeric change may attend the displacement of the sulphonic radicle
by chlorine appears to have been abandoned. The results obtained,

especially by Cleve and by Dr. Wynne and the writer, are so uniformly

consistent inter se that, bearing in mind the extent of the field covered,
there is no longer room for doubt. Observations made during the past
year are of interest as throwing light on the nature of the interaction.

      There have long been instances on record of the conversion of sulpho-
chlorides into corresponding chloro-derivatives and sulphur dioxide
(E,S02Cl=RCl-f SO2) by mere distillation. The successful use recently

made of this method in the writer's laboratory in preparing chloro- and
bromo-derivatives of camphor by Dr. Kipping and Mr. Pope has led him

and Dr. Wynne to systematically study the behaviour of naphthalene

sulphochlorides, which they had long known underwent decomposition,
evolving sulphur dioxide, when heated. The conclu.sion arrived at is that,

in all probability, phosphorus pentachloride acts merely by facilitating the
resolution of the sulphochloride into sulphur dioxide and the chloro-deriva-
tive by attacking the former and converting it into thionyl chloride ; and
that, in fact, the chlorine in the chloro- derivative is not improbably the
original chlorine of the sulphochloride and not chlorine derived from the
pentachloride. In most cases the amount of chloro-derivative produced
by directly distilling the sulphochloride is inferior to that obtained by means
of pentachloride, as the decomposition is facilitated by the chloride, and
therefore takes place at a lower temperature in its presence. There is
always more or less of a resinoid condensation product formed on distilling
the sulphochloride, but the amount is in some cases very small, while in

others practically nothing else is obtained. On the other hand, in the

case of compounds which are very readily chlorinated, the method permits

of the production of chloro-derivatives corresponding to the sulpho-

chlorides which are almost unprocurable from them by the ordinary method.
For example, 1 : I'-chloronaphthalenesulphonic chloride yields a very large
proportion of 1 ." I'-dichloronaphthalene when distilled, although when
heated with phosphorus pentachloride it is almost entirely converted into

1:4:1' trichloronaphthalene. The a-sulphochlorides appear all to

decompose more readily and to yield a larger proportion of chloro-derivative

than do the /j- sulphochlorides. It may be added that, taking into account the

 readiness with which change occurs during sulphonation, the non- occurrence
of isomeric change on distilling sulphochlorides is probably significant.

   --Bromo-derivatives of Naphthalene. The conversion of naphthalene

sulphobromides into corresponding bromonaphthalenes by means of phos-
 phorus pentabromide is attended with great difficulty, as the bromide
 frequently acts almost exclusively as a brominating agent, owing to the
readiness with which it is resolved into the terbromide and bromine. Far
            ON ISOMERIC NAPTHALENE DERIVATIVES.           269

better results are obtained in many cases by merely distilling the sulpho-

bromide, although the formation of higher bromo-derivatives is not
entirely avoided. During the year Mr. Jenks and the writer have

made considerable progress in completing the series of bromonaphtha-
lenes (di- and tri-derivatives), and in determining the nature of the
sulphonic acids prepared from the dibromonaphthalenes by Mr. Rossiter

and the writer.

    One result of which mention may be made relates to the tribromo-

naphthalene obtained by Jolin by distilling nitro-l : 4-dibromonaph-

thalene with phosphorus pentabromide, which hitherto has always been
represented as the 1 : 4 : 1' derivative, apparently because it is supposed
that, as a rule, o-nitro-compounds are formed on nitrating naphthalene
derivatives. Judging from the low melting-point of the tribromonaph-
thalene in question, it is improbable that it is a tri-a-derivative, as such

a tribromonaphthalene should melt at a much higher temperature. The

accuracy of this conclusion is established by the observation that 1 : 4-
dibromonaphthalene /(etero-/?-sulphonic bromide is converted by distilla-

tion into a tribromonaphthalene which is undoubtedly identical with that

prepared from nitro-l : 4-dibromonaphthalene.
     Attempts to devise a satisfactory method of preparing 1 : I'dibromo-

naphthalene had been made by Mr. Jenks and the writer prior to

Meldola's discovery of this modification, and as these have been continued

to a successful issue reference may be made to the subject. The first

method devised involved brominating the acetyl derivative of Guareschi's

1     4'  bromonaphthylamine,  prepared  by  brominating  nitronaphthalene,

   :

&c. ; this readily a0"ords what appears to be a 1 : I'-dibromacetnaphthalide,

but the greatest difiiculty has been experienced in hydrolysing this

compound.

   A second method consists in nitrating 1 : 4-bromonaphthalene sulpho-

Achloride.  1 : r-nitrobromosulphochloride is readily obtained, but,

although the chief product, it is by no means the only one.

   A third and far simpler method consists in heating 1 : 4-bromonaph-

thalene sulphochloride with bromine and subsequently hydrolysing the
1 : 1-dibromosulphochloride, which is almost the exclusive product when

the operation is properly carried out.

   Although it is known that naphthalene-p-sulphonic acid is very readily

converted into 1 : 4-dibromonaphthalene /;e?ero-/j-sulphonic acid, the order
in which the bromine atoms enter has not been determined ; and it is, in fact,
difficult to arrest the action at an intermediate stage, the tendency to form
the dibromo-derivative being very great. Mr. Stallard, however, having

kindly placed a quantity of monobrominated /3-sulphonate at the writer's

disposal, it has been ascertained that it is an «,-bromo-/33'-derivative.

By heating naphthalene-/J-sulphochloride with a molecular proportion of

bromine a very satisfactory amount of 1 : 3'-bromosulphochloride is readily
obtained. The ' repellent ' influence of an acid radicle is clearly brought

out by these results, as /3-bromonaphtlialene yields 1 : 2 -dibromonaph-

thalene when brominated.

   It is well known that there is often great difficulty, especially in the

case of o-naphthol and d-naphthylamine, in obtaining satisfactory yields

of bromo-derivatives, a considerable amount of by-product being formed,
the nature of which has not been understood hitherto. Some light has
been thrown on the nature of these products by observations made by Mr.

Jenks and the writer.
--270 REPORT 1894.

     Following the directions given by Cosiner and by Claus and Phillipson,
monobrom /j-acetnaphthalide was prepared by mixing bromine with
j3-acetnaphthalide dissolved in acetic acid ; although the conditions were
greatly varied, the amounts of pure product obtained were in all cases very
unsatisfactory, rarely exceeding 25 per cent. The main product was a
crystalline substance, more soluble in alcohol than monobromo-/>acetnaph-
thalide, but almost insoluble in acetic acid, ethylic acetate, chloroform,

xylene and water. When digested with a weak solution of caustic soda

this substance is converted into monobromo-/3-acetnaphthalide, and the
same effect is produced by digesting it with a solution of either sulphurous
acid or potassium iodide. It appears to be probable that this substance
contains the elements of a molecule of bromo-/3-acetnaphthalide and a
molecule of bromine ; such a compound would contain 56*6 per cent, of
bromine, The highest amount found was 52 per cent. ; but as the substance

undergoes decomposition when recrystallised from alcohol, it cannot be
obtained pure. It is not produced by brominating bromo-/3-acetnaphtha-

lide, and therefore is probably formed together with it, being perhaps an
addition compound, such as is represented by the formula

By digesting the crude product of the action of a single molecular

proportion of bromine on one of /3-acetnaphthalide with a weak solution of
caustic soda, and then recrystallising from spirit, as much as 75 per cent.

of the theoretical yield of bromo-/3-acetnaphthalide can be obtained.

  --Hule expressive of the Formation of Sulphonic Acids. Dressel and

Kothe, in a recent most interesting paper,' have taken exception to the

'rule' suggested by Dr. Wynne and the writer, referred to in previous

reports, that there is an ' invincible objection ' on the pai't of two sulphonic

groups to remain in either contiguous, or para-, or peri-positions ; they have

described a tri- and a tetra-sulphonic acid, each containing two sulphonic

Weradicles in contiguous /3 /3 positions.  shall have occasion to discuss

their results when the investigation of the changes attending sulphona-

-- --tion the most difficult and complex chapter of the subject is somewhat

     Pengelly, and Mr. J. J. Wilkinson, appointed to as -ertain whether

    the Remains of Palceolitldc Man occur in the Lower Cate Earth.

The work of excavation in this cave has now ceased. Since our last
report the debris from the cave mouth has been cleared away, and in some

material that was taken from the upper Neolithic layer a flint flake was

Afound. Hitherto no flint tools had been discovered.  further depth of

10 feet was sunk to the bottom of the fissure, through a bed of sand and

aravel, but no bones were found. The fissure still continues, being now
Aonly 5 to 6 feet in width.
                             total thickness of 60 feet has now been

removed beneath the original cave floor. While an enormous quantity

of bones have been obtained from the lower layer, yet no trace of Palseo-

lithic man has been noticed, and, as this was the special purpose of the

investigation, the Committee decided to bring the work to a close.

A1. NEW species of Beecher's phyllocaridal genus Elymocaris, from the

collection of Dr. G. J. Hinde, F.G.S., has been figured and described

in the 'Geological Magazine' for July 1894, p. 292, pi. ix. fig. 7. It was
found at Arkona, Ontario, Canada, in the Hamilton group of the Middle

Devonian series.

     Its nearest known ally is Elymocaris capsella (Hall and Clarke), from

the  Hamilton group  of  New York       State,  New'Palseont.  York,' vol. vii.

1888, p. 181, pi. xxxi. fig. 4. It differs, however, in details of outline,

ornament, and ocular spot. The new species is named E. Hindei, after its

discoverer.

    2. Two imperfect sets of abdominal segments, impressed on a piece of

Moffat Shale (from Garpel Linn), have been noticed in association with a
carapace of Discinocaris Browniana, and therefore probably belonging to
individuals of either that genus and species, or of Aj^tychopsis, or possibly
Peltocaris, which also occur in the Moffat Shales. The two above-mentioned

specimens are figured and described in the ' Geological Magazine ' for July
1894, p. 291, pi. ix. figs. 4ffl, 46. Fig. 3 shows the associated carapace.
They belong to the Carlisle Museum.

   We have noticed similar abdominal segments, but differing somewhat

in size, associated with Hymenocaris in the Tremadoc slates, and Avith

Ceratiocaris in the Upper Silurian beds. As such body rings belong to

various groups of these low-class Crustacea, it is not extraordinary that
the above-mentioned genera should each possess the same kind of structure

in the abdominal region.

   A3. good-sized Discinocaris Brotvniana and the moiety of a rather

large Ajytychopsis Wilsoni, preserved in the Carlisle Museum, have also

been described and figured in the July number of the 'Geological Magazine,'

1894, p. 292, pi. ix. figs. 5 and 6. They are typical of the Moffat Shales.
--272 REPORT 1894.

    4. It may be remarked that the figured interior of the bipartite carapace

of Macrocaris Gorbyi, Miller, referred to in our Tenth Report, at page 468,
'Report British Association' for 1893, appears (if looked at upside down)

very much to resemble some of the bivalved Aptychopses figured in the
'Monograph of Palaeozoic Phyllopoda,' Pal. Soc, 1892, pi. xv., but with
a more acutely sagittate outline, and without the definitely concentric
umbonal striae.

     If the carapace in the drawing (tig. 43) exposes its ' interior,' it seems
to lie unconformably with respect to the body-rings, for they appear to be
covered by the carapace upside down. If it normally covered the body,
it would show its exterior.

     Is it possible that after death, the attachments of the body and cara-
pace having been loosened, the carapace turned quite over, and the parts
of the animal floated into a position reverse to what they held in life ?
Or have we here two valves and an imperfect body of an Aptychopsis

--which during decay were washed into a reversed position that is, with

the abdomen projecting from the anterior region, as is not unusual witli
some fossil Ceratiocaridce ?

    5. By favour of Dr. Wheelton Hind, F.G.S., we have very lately seer,

from Mr. George Wild's collection, some pyritous specimens of what seem
to be a very small Estheria in shale from the roof of the Bullion Coal,
Lower Coal-measures, lately worked at Trawden, near Colne, in North-east

Lancashire.

   A6. specimen of Estheria Dmosoni, Jones (' Geol. Mag.,' 1870, p. 220,

pi. ix. fig. 15; ibid., 1876, p. 576; ibid., 1878, p. 101, pi. iii. fig. 2), has

been obtained from the vicinity of Five-Islands, Nova Scotia, by Mr. H.

Fletcher, of the Geological Survey of Canada. Like a former specimen,

it may be from the Horton Series ; and has been sent by Sir W. Dawson,

F.R.S., of Montreal, for our e.xamination.

--jExiiloraUon. of ilie GoJf Hole Gave at iJie Heights, Shiirethorns, near
      SMpton. Beport of the Committee, consisting o/Mr. R. H. Tiddeman
    (Ghahinnn), Rev. E. JoNES (Secretarij), Professor W. BoYD Daw-
      kins, Prolessor L. C. MiALL, Mr. P. F. Kendall, Mr. A. Birt-
      WHISTLE, and Mr. J. J. WILKINSON.

This cave lies on the west side of a limestone scar on the Heights Farm,
and its entrance is about 30 feet above the plain at the foot of the scar.
The entrance chamber is 33 feet long and from 14 feet to 26 feet in width.

A well-buttressed column of rock supports the roof, forming two archway

entrances to the cave. The outlook westward from these entrances is very

fine and the platform would be of value to prehistoric man as a shelter.
At the north-east corner of the entrance chamber is another cave, here

8 feet wide, and which after a short course of 10 feet turns eastward.
This latter cave was originally blocked up, and a former tenant of the

farm attempted to open it out. He found a few worked flints, a long iron

spear-head, and the bones of numerous small mammals. But the ignorance
and want of skill of the workers made their finds of little value. In
Au<^ust of 1S93 your Secretary made some experimental trenches in the
        ON EXPLORATION OF THE CALF HOLE CA\ E.                         273

entrance chamber. In one cutting on the east side of the pillar, at a depth

of 18 inches, a remarkable and unique implement was found resting on a

bed of clay. The tool consists of a haft 6 inches long of reindeer antler

Awith a socket at the upper end.  well-rounded hole half an inch in

diameter has been made through the haft. The circumference of the haft

is 4| inches at the socket and 5| inclies at the other end. Into the socket
has been well inserted a large tooth, forming a powerful chisel, which
would be of great value to its possessor. The hole in the middle of the

haft might be for the insertion of a thong to be fastened round the
waist. The character of the tooth, whether boar or hippopotamus, has
not yet been ascertained. Another trench was cut towards the little
cave, and here, near the surface, were found a neat flint saw and a flint

flake.

     Since the last meeting of the Association, and with the aid of the small

grant given to us, much preliminary work has been done to render possible
a thorough and orderly exploration. The material that had been taken

out of the little cave by the previous explorers and placed in the entrance
chamber was first cleared away. Thin ' spits ' of about 6-inch layers were
taken successively from the surface of the entrance chamber, carefully
examined, and then tipped outside the cave. The top layer of 2 or 3
inches was of loamy clay, crowded with bones of small animals, frogs, rats,

voles, (fee. Beneath this was a layer, varying from a foot to 18 inches thick,
of darkened earth containing angular fragments of limestone, some burnt

sandstones, bones of sheep, horse, fox, badger, rabbit, hare and otter, bits
of charcoal and charred bird-bones. In this layer a few flints were
found, and at the bottom, resting on the clay, was the hafted tool. This
implement is thus most likely of Neolithic age, though it was found
on the top of the more ancient layer which contained the bones of

bison, &c.

     The lower layers consist so far of irregular beds of washed-in stuff",
stifi" clay, then sandy clay over patches of gravel and sand. In this

material are rounded boulders of both grit and limestone, together with

pieces of stalagmite. On none of the boulders have we noticed any ice-

scratches. Fragments of bones are interspersed throughout the mass,
sometimes embedded in the patches of stiff clay as well as in the gravel
and sands. These bones are of very different character from those found
in the upper layers. They are mostly dark in colour, much mineralised,
and thus heavy. The bones so far identified belong to the bison, reindeer,
roebuck, horse, and grizzly bear. Some show evidence of having been
gnawed. Most of them are very fragmentary, often only sharp splinters.

From the current bedding it seems that the bones must have been washed
into the cave by the same means as the gi-its and limestone boulders. The

finds are not abundant yet from the variety obtained the excavationi
                                                                                                    ;

promises to be interesting in confirming the lists of Pleistocene fauna that
have been found in other parts of North-east Yorkshire.

     The Committee are indebted to Sir Matthew Wilson for permission tO'

explore on his estate, and for his kindly co-operation in their work.

27(6 Collection, Preservation, and Systematic Registration of Photograj^hs

  --of Geological Interest in the United Kingdom. Fifth Report of the

     Committee, consisting of Professor James Geikie (Chairman),
     Professor T. G. Bonney, Dr. Tempest Anderson, Dr. Valentine

    Ball, Mr. James E. Bedford, Professor W. Boyd Dawkins,
     Mr. Edmund J. Garwood, Mr. J. G. Goodchild, Mr. William

     Gray, Mr. Robert Kidston, Mr. Arthur S. Reid, Mr. J. J. H.

    Teall, Mr. R. H. Tiddeman, Mr. W. W. Watts, Mr. Horace
    B. Woodward, a,nd' Mr. Osmund W. Jeffs {Secretary). (Dravn

       ujp try the Secretary.)

Since the last Report, presented at the Nottingham meeting of the Asso-
ciation, your Committee have been enabled to add 215 photographs to
their collection, which has now reached a total of 1,055. This number,
again, shows a gratifying increase as compared with the two previous years.
The majority of these were, however, received late in the year, and it has
been found impossible to have them all arranged for exhibition before the
date of the opening meeting at Oxford. Your Committee, therefore,
 respectfully suggest reappointment for another year at least, in order to
enable a complete and revised catalogue to be drawn up, which would be
 more valuable for reference than the partial lists appearing in the various
 annual reports. During the next year it is hoped that societies who have
 been for some time engaged in the work of systematic photography of
 geological sections in their districts, but have not yet sent in the results
 obtained, will be able to make further progress with the work and enable
 the Committee to make their own collection moi'e complete. The col-
 lection has now assumed such proportions that a rearrangement of a more
 systematic character than has hitherto been possible has become neces-
 sary, and with the additions that are expected from various sources this
 rearrangement in suitable albums and cases, duly indexed, will occupy
 some time.

      The question of the location of the large number of photographs
 now obtained has received the serious attention of the Committee, and
 they have recommended to the Council that the collection be deposited at
 the Museum of Practical Geology, London, where, in their opinion, it
  would be most accessible to the general public for purposes of reference.

      At a meeting of the Committee held during the Nottingham meeting

  several matters were discussed bearing upon the furtherance of the objects
  for which the Committee were appointed. The various local societies have
  been again urged, by circular, to assist the scheme of the Committee with
  the object of completing a national collection of photographs, to serve as a

  photographic survey of the geology of our own country.
       The Committee, having invited the views of members who are practical

  photographers as to the most suitable form of camera for geological field
  work, beg to tender their thanks to Drs. Tempest Anderson and H. J.
  Johnston- Lavis, and to Messrs. Wilbert Goodchild, A. R. Hunt, C.
  Defieux, and F. N. Eaton for suggestions and assistance rendered. It
  still appears to be difficult to recommend a particular form of instrument,

  as almost every photographer has his own favourite camera, and the
  apparatus required varies with the class of work to be undertaken in the

field. It is pi-oposed, however, to give in the next Report some hints

which may be of use to those engaged in photographing rocks and other

ceological features.

    Among the donations of photographs added to the collection during

the pa^tyear are several of great scientific value as illustrations of geologi-
cal interest. The Committee desire to record their obligations to tlie

--following donors of photographs : The Belfast Naturalists' Field Club,

Croydon Natural History and Microscopical Society, Leicester Literary

and Philosophical Society, the Manchester Geographical Society, and the

Perthshire Society  of    Natural Science                                                                              Miss  Mary K.  Andrews,  Dr.
                                                                                                                    ;

R. G. Brook, Henry Coates, F. N. Eaton, H. D. Gower, Wm. Gray,

Wilbert Goodchild, E. J. Garwood, W. Lamont Howie, H. L. P. Lowe,

J. G. McDakin, G. A. Piquet, H. Preston, C. J. Watson, and R. Welch.
The Belfast Naturalists' Field Club have contributed an exceedingly

valuable series of photographs illustrating the Antrim chalks and basalts,
together with some fine examples of marine denudation. The extensive

series of whole-plate prints, taken by Messrs. J. Burton and Sons for the

Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society (for which the Committee are
indebted to the good offices of Mr. Montagu Browne), afford some charac-

teristic examples of the advantageous application of photograpliy to

geological illustration.

The following suggestions have been received as to suitable sections,

<fec., of which photographs are desirable, and the Committee hope that
some photographer in the localities mentioned will be able to undertake
the work :

since the publication of the last Report. Photographers are asked to
affix to their negatives the registered numbers, as given below, for con-
venience of future reference.

     Copies of photographs desired, and, in many cases, lantern slides, can

usually be obtained either from the photographer direct or from the
officers of the local society under whose auspices the views were taken.

    The price at which prints or lantern slides may be obtained depends

upon local circumstances, over which the Committee have no control.
     The Committee find it necessary to reiterate the fact that they do not

assume the copyright of any photographs included in this list. Inquiries
respecting them, and applications for permission to reproduce photographs,
should not be addressed to the Committee, but to the photographer direct.

The reporter has made good progress with the digest of the previous

nineteen reports, which will be ready for publication this year, giving the
details grouped in geological formations and counties.

     The reporter, through unavoidable circumstances, is unable to be
present this year, and is anxious to point out that not only has the Car-

diff Naturalists' Society sent a valuable contribution, but several other
societies federated to the British Association intend to furnish informa-
tion ; this being the case, he ventures to point out that it appears
desirable to continue the work of your Committee, and that it is evident
that if the work entrusted to them in 1874 be terminated in 1894 it
will be continued by the federated societies, but the details of sections

and analyses will be scattered over many publications and will not be

of general use and access to engineers and sanitai-ians, and the results
obtained will be published under various modes and conditions not

admitting of common reference, as is the case in the reports emanating

from your Committee.
     The Committee would therefore venture to suggest that, as valuable

information can still be obtained through the agency of local societies, they

be reappointed without grant.

     Your Committee have to deplore the death of one of their original

members, Mr. Wm. Pengelly, F.K.S., who contributed most valuable infor-

mation in the early days of the investigation, and throughout has taken

an active interest in the work.

     ' B.' contains a larger proportion of mineral salts than is usual in even
the hardest water used for domestic supply, but there is nothing injurious
in these salts except that they waste soap and prevent the water from
cleansing the skin even with a great quantity of soap, as well as from
cooking such things as tea without great waste.

     There is no organic matter and no products derived from any previous

sewage contamination ; it is free from common salt.

      ' W.' is not quite so free from organic matter, but the quantity of
organic matter derived from it is very small.

     The hardening salts and the other mineral salts are within ordinary

limits.

     As a general rule the deep bore waters are safer than upper waters.

it would oflfer some advantages, and should a suitable supply not be
obtainable additional hardness might be added to the water artificially.

This water contains a little organic matter and the remains of oxidised

animal matter of some kind ; but the quantity is not large, and probably

the water might be easily kept sufficiently pure so far as these constituents

are concerned. It contains a very excessive proportion of common salt,

and a considerable proportion of chloride of calcium and sulphate of

calcium and other phosphates. If this can be accounted for by the

infiltration of sea water through the sand, or by the occurrence of salt

deposit in the rock, the saltness may be considered not to affect the

wholesomeness  of  the water                                         if  the  saltness  cannot  be  accounted  for in

this way the water must be considered a suspicious one.

      of the Committee, consisting of Dr. E. H. Traquair (Chairman),

     Professor T. Rupert Jones, and Mr. Malcolm Laurie (Secretary).
     (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

During the past year a considerable amount of time has been spent in
developing the material already acquired. The grant of money was chiefly
expended in securing the assistance of Mr. Henderson, the original dis-
coverer of these fossil beds. Thanks to his able assistance a considerable
part of the material has been worked over with very satisfactory results,
thougli much yet remains to be examined.

     The specimens already obtained include five species of Eurypteric'oe
                                                     --

--belonging to four genera. One of these, a specimen unfortunately badly
--preserved of Pterygotus, is new to this locality, and is in all probability

new to science. It is allied by the form of the telson to Pt. anglicns
from the Old Red Sandstone rather than to the common Silurian form

Pt. bilobus. It is the first species with a pointed telson from the Silurian,
of this country, though this form of telson has been described by Pohlmann
from the Buffalo Limestones of America.

     The genus Eurypterus is also only represented by a single specimen,

which, though much larger than the type specimen, I am inclined to refer

to Eurypterus conicus.
     Sfylonurus ornatus, the large form from these beds, is represented by a

considerable number of specimens, mostly fragmentary. One specimen
shows the body minus the carapace and telson to have been 10 inches in
length. The details of a number of the appendages have been made out,
including the two posterior pairs which are the long walking legs charac-
teristic of the genus. The posterior of these has a length of 9 inches, the
anterior of about 7^ inches. In front of these two appendages I have
made out representatives of two other pairs of limbs, both of which are
furnished with long spines. The detailed description of these and other
points of interest must, however, be postponed till a more thorough investi -

gation has been made.
     The other species of Stylonurus which occurs in these beds St. mac-

--roj)hthalmus is well represented. One specimen is almost complete, only

wanting the telson and part of one side of the body. It shows four
appendages down one side. The two posterior limbs are more unequal in
size than is usual in this genus, the anterior one being far more slender
than the posterior and only two-thirds its length. The appendages in front of
these do not appear to be so well furnished with spines as in St. oniatnif.
Another specimen of this form, though very fragmentary, has shown, after
careful development, five legs down one side of the carapace. They have
not yet, however, been fully worked out. There are various other fragments,
showing parts of the body, tail spines, itc.

     Of the other form occurring in these beds, Drepano'pteTus jientlandicus,

we have been fortunate enough to secure one almost perfect specimen,

which shows the form of the body and three pairs of limbs. The form of
the last pair of limbs but one confirms the relationship of this form to
Stylonurus. There are many other more or less fragmentary specimens,

which may be expected to yield further information as to the details of

this interesting genus.

     Besides the Eurypteridse the bed has yielded a considerable number of
other fossils, among which may be mentioned : Graptolites, various Poly-
zoa, a species of Gomphoceras, Lingula and other brachiopods. These,
when properly identified, may be expected to yield important information

as to the exact horizon of the beds.

     In view of the large amount of material which yet remains to be
examined and the interest of the results which are briefly referred to above,
your Committee ask to be continued for another year with a further

grant.
--301 REPORT 1894.

--Sfonesfleld Slate. Beport of the Committee, consisting of Mr. H. B.

    Woodward {Chairman), Mr. E. A. Walford (Secretari/), Professor
     A. H. Green, Dr. H. Woodward, and Mr. J. Windoes, appointed

      to open further sections in the neighbourhood of Stonesfield in order
      to show the relationship of the Stonesfield Slate to the underhjing

     and overh/ing strata. (JDravm np In/ Mr. Edwix A. Walford,

        Secretari/.)

The basement beds of the Great Oolite in the Midlands and in the south-

west counties of England have been hitherto supposed to be well defined.

For in all the records of the many writers on this geologic subdivision,

to the Stonesfield Slate has been assigned the line of separation from
the Fuller's Earth or Inferior Oolite, or, where the Stonesfield Slate is
absent, as in the extreme west, to the Minchinhampton beds has been

given the same position. Undue prominence has been given to so incon-
staut a series of beds as the Slate, as much from the ease with which

fossils for its study have been collected as from the varied character

of the fauna and flora found in it. From the days when the finding of
the mammalian remains in the Slate called the attention of geologists

prominently to it, every text-book of geology has found a place for it at
the bottom of the Great Oolite limestones. Though, however text-books
and papers have defined the lower boundary of the Great Oolite so clearly,
tlie officers of the Geological Survey in their work in the neighbourhood
of Stonesfield found the lines so difficult to define that it became neces-
sary, where the Slate had disappeared, to adopt an intermediate colour-
ing, a kind of no-man's-land. Since then an argillaceous stratum, ' the
Rift bed,' has been recognised as the lowest of the Great Oolite beds in

tlie Banbury and Hook Norton area.
     The endeavour of the work, for which the British Association made a

money grant in 1893, has been to ascertain the thickness and composition

of the beds underlj'ing the Slate, for hitherto no account of these beds has
been obtainable. Professor Ed. Hull's record ' of 70 feet being the only
assumed thickness of the Great Oolite, and to this he adds 30 feet for the
Inferior Oolite. Though their thicknesses seem to be over-estimated, no
correction or account of a series of I'ocks so important has since then been

written. Nearer Chipping Norton, however, Mr. J. Windoes, Mr. W. H.

 Hudleston,^ and your Secretary ^ have worked at some of the debatable
 beds above the Clypeus grit, one of the highest of the Cotswold divisions
of the Inferior Oolite. 'To the bulk of these beds has been given the name
 of the ' Chipping Norton Limestone ' by Mr. Hudleston,^ and though the

 beds have not been reached in the section, they may be seen in the lane

 sections and near the spring on the banks of the Evenlode, south of
 Stonesfield. Your Secretary in 1892-93 sank a shaft near Ditchley, Oxon,
 to find out the true position of the Slate beds there ; but of this an account
 will be published elsewhere.

      The progress of the work, so far, at Stocky Bank, Stonesfield, has

consisted in scarping the bank for 33 feet, and in continuing the section
by carrying a shaft of 20 feet in depth through the lower bank. The
purpose of the work has been so far successfully carried out by showing the
existence of 30 feet of rock with some thin clay courses below the Slate.
 These limestones and clays (see accompanying section on p. 306) are of Great
Oolite type. To reach the Clypeus grit will need an extension of time.

     Your Secretary has, by the discovery of numerous species of corals on
the ploughed fields on the bank top, been able to define the coral bed

 (Rift bed) ' so prominent a feature in the near section at Ashford Bridge.
Seventeen feet below the coral bed a course of Slate is met with, almost
thinned out at that point, and only from 5 to 7 inches in thickness

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the total thickness of it and the associated beds (10, 12, 13 of the section)
being about 5 feet. The usual fossils, Trigonia impressa, <fec., occur. In
the lower limestones, 15 and 17, are greenish clay inclusions.

     The great mass of buff limestone below the slate is almost unfossiliferous,
and neither its mineralogical character nor its few fossils give sure evi-

dence of its relationship to neighbouring beds.
      Prominent in the lower half of the section is the breaking up of the cal-

careous series by small clay beds, and of these No. 23, with its dark compact
clays, is in part made up of oyster-shell fragments. It contains numerous
compressed shells, Perna quadrata, Nucula, &c., but washings of the beds
yield hardly any microzoa. The limestone above the clay yields well-

known Great Oolite shells, Mytilus Sowerhyanns, Rhynchonella concinna,
and Ostrea Sowerbyi. The shelly limestone below the clay is in part an

Oyster iumachelle, and passes into a blue-hearted limestone with Perna
quadrata, large Cyprince, Corbtila, and Macrodon. Here, again, both
petrological facies and fauna are dissimilar to any of our known Oxford-
shire Oolitic rocks, and, like each of the succeeding lower beds, should be-
classed as Great Oolite ; one of the latter, a hard very oolite freestone,

has also as distinctive a character.

     In conclusion, it should be stated that though, when Professor Ed.

Hull reported to your Association at its Oxford meeting, thirty-four years
ago (1860), the presence of seventy feet of Great Oolite limestone under
the Stonesfield Slate, it seemed to be an over-estimate, yet the result of
the present investigation has been to prove the presence of an important-
and overlooked section of the Great Oolite, and to entitle place for it ir^
future accounts of that subdivision. That Professor A. H. Green doubted
the existence of so great a series of beds as those quoted by Professor
Hull is proved by the absence of any account of them in his excellent

memoir ' On the Geology of the Country round Banbury, Woodstock,

Bicester, and Buckingham,' published in 1864.
     Mr. James Windoes, Mr. Wilfred Hudleston, Mr. H. B. Woodward,

and your Secretary have also worked in later years at the determination
of the equivalent of these lower Bathonian beds in the neighbourhood of

Chipping Norton.

....Appendix-- O/i tlw Chapelhall Clay, by D. Kobertson

I. Locality and Previous Notices.

Chapelhall is a little mining village situated in the north-oastern part
of Lanarkshire, about twelve miles east from Glasgow and two miles south
from Airdrie. Its name has been well known to geologists for more than
 thirty years past from its being usually mentioned in works relating to
the science as the highest locality in Scotland where ' shelly clay ' has been
 found (510 feet above the sea). That of Clava, near Liverness, which the
Committee reported upon last year, is of more recent discovery, and has

not been so generally referred to.

     It may be useful, first, to present a summary of the hitherto existing

--information regarding this ' deposit.'
      (i.) Mr. Smith, of Jordanhill. The 'shelly clay' at Chapelhall was
first brought into notice by Mr. Smith, of Jordanhill, in a paper read to
the Geological Society in 1850, and republished in his well-known little
volume of ' Researches in Newer Pliocene and Post-Tertiary Geology,' in

1862. The following is the passage referring to this 'deposit : '
      ' Having been informed by Mr. John Craig, F.G.S., that a bed of

shells had been discovered near Aii'drie, much higher than any previously

found in Scotland, I considered it of importance to ascertain the exact

amount of the elevation above the present level of the sea, as well as the
species of the shells, and the nature of the deposit in which they are

found. Mr. Craig kindly accompanied me to the locality, which is near

the Monkland Iron Works, and about fourteen miles to the south-east of

Glasgow.

     ' The shelly deposit in question proved to be a bed of the TeUina
proxima, Brown (T. calcarea 1 Linn.), an Arctic species extremely abun-
dant in the Clyde Pleistocene beds overlying the till, and which I had
formerly procured from a brick-work in the same neighbourhood.' The
shells in the present instance were discovered by Mr. James Russell, an

operative miner, in digging a well.'

     Mr. Smith then states that he ascertained the elevation of the place
to be, on the surface, 524 feet above the sea, which is 'at least 150 feet
higher than the highest level at which any shelly deposits have been

hitherto discovered in Scotland.' He continues :

     ' The most remarkable circumstance attending the present discovery is
that the shells were imbedded in the stratified clay below the till.

      'Mr. Russell states that at the depth of 14 feet from the surface,
after passing through the till, he came to a bed of brick-clay containing

' This refers to shells previously stated to have been found by Mr. Craig near

Airdrie, at a height of 350 feet. See Hesearches, kc, p. 17. (The j lace, an old

brickfield, has long been filled up.)

the sliells, which were therefore 510 feet above the level of the sea. I could
entertain no doubt as to the nature of the superincumbent matter, as that
part of it which had been thrown out was left lying at the mouth of the
well. It was unquestionably the true till. Indeed, if I had entertained
any doubt as to this point, it would have been removed by the discovery
of a small granite boulder, which was found about 2 feet above the bottom
of the till. The nearest granite rock in that direction (N.W.) is at

Cruachan, about sixty miles N.W. of Airdrie. . . .
     ' I may add that ]\Ir. Russell states that after passing through the

shelly bed of brick-clay, he came again to the till, thus proving indispu-
tably what has always been suspected, that there has been more than one

 deposition of the till or boulder-clay.'

   --(ii.) Sir Archibald Geikie. In the preparation of his valuable memoir

on ' The Phenomena of the Glacial Drift of Scotland,' published in ISGS,'^
Sir Archibald Geikie visited the spot, also under Mr. Russell's guidance.

He described it as situated ' on the crest of a ridge which, rising high

above the surrounding country, commands an extensive view across the

lower part of the basin of the Clyde. On the water shed of this high-

lying ridge a well was sunk some years ago, and while the excavations
were in progress the shells were found.' Sir Archibald then gives particu-
lars corresponding with those stated by Mr. Smith, adding that the till
underneath the shelly clay was ' about 24 feet thick, and lay directly on
the Carboniferous strata of the district. The brick-clay at its thickest
part,' he continues, 'measured 2 feet 1 inch in depth, but thinned away
rapidly on every side, so as to allow the upper and lower till to come

together. From a number of additional wells, sunk on purpose, Mr.

Russell ascertained that the clay lay in a hollow of the undermost till,
and that this hollow measured about 19 feet long by about 5 feet broad.
Pits which were dug beyond the boundary of this little trough showed a

great depth of the usual till, but without a trace of brick-clay. The

shells consisted entirely, I believe, of Tellina proxima. Usually the

.specimens were broken, but a good many were taken out entire, with

both valves together.'*

   --(iii.) Dr. Crosskey. About the same time as Sir A. Geikie's visit,,

or apparently before it (though the account was later in being published),
Dr. Crosskey visited the locality, and made some observations which were

communicated in a paper to the Geological Society in January 1865.^ He

remarked : ' One of the most perplexing cases in Scotland, upon any theory

of the formation of boulder-clay, has been the alleged occurrence at
Chapelhall, near Airdrie, of a bed of clay containing 2'ellina calcarea,
intercalated between the masses of true boulder-clay.

     ' The facts relating to the discovery of these shells have been recorded
by Mr. Smith. . . . The present paper will simply examine the question
whether the superincumbent matter was, without doubt, the true till.'

     After defining what he means by the term ' a compact, unstratified
clay, with a large proportion of striated stones, chiefly of local origin,' and

stating that ' the glacial shells in the west are never found within the

boulder-clay proper,' but ' invariably above it,' Dr. Crosskey proceeds :
      ' Mr. Russell (the original discoverer of the shells) reports that the

     * With great kindness, Mr. Russell sank a fresh well seven yards from
the old one, and the following section was exposed :

 2. Upper cLvy
 3. Boulder-clay not pierced through  ......589 G

     ' There were decided distinctions between the upper and lower clays.
- . . The upper clay was looser and more easily worked than the lower.
. . . The junction between the two clays was recognised by Mr. Russell

--as the exact position at which he had found the original shell-bed.'
     Dr. Crosskey added : 'There is no evidence whatever that the Chapel

hall fossils were in the boulder-clay, in any sense which would make that

clay a marine formation.'

     From the foregoing quotations it is apparent that the references made

by Mr. Smith, Sir A. Geikie, and Dr. Crosskey, to the occurrence of
shelly clay in the Chapelhall well section, rested solely on the statements
of Mr. James Russell.

     With the view of obtaining further information the Committee re-
solved to re-examine the well section and to put down a series of trial

bores.

                           ir. Examination by the Committee.

                                          1. The Well Section.

     Mr. James Russell, the original authority regarding this shelly clay at
Chapelhall, died about fourteen years ago. The cottage which he built
and occupied, and in the garden of which the ' well ' is situated, stands at
the west end of Chapelhall, and somewhat higher than the village, near
the summit, as has been said, of the ridge on which the village is built.
It is called 'Wanlock Cottage,' and is now occupied by Mr. James
Lindsay, a mining foreman, who purchased it several years ago from
Mr. Russell's son.

      Mr. Lindsay, having been informed of the object of the proposed
examination by the Committee, kindly agreed to afford every facility for
the work and assist it by every means in his power.

    An arrangement was accordingly made that the well should be

emptied and the stone-work removed, so as to expose the section all
round to a depth of at least 15 or 16 feet.

      Mr. Robert Dunlop, of Whiterigg, Aii-drie, obligingly assisted Mr.
Lindsay in the operations, and the Secretary of the Committee repeatedly
visited the spot during their progress.

     On Saturday, March 24 last, the section being then exposed to a
depth of fully 15 feet from the surface, the Chairman, Mr. Home, met
----

310 REPORT-- 189 i

Mr. Dunlop and the Secretary by appointment at the well, and made a

careful examination of the section.'
     Underneath 2 feet of surface soil they found the materials composed

entirely of the typical boulder-clay of the district, full of stones, sub-

angular, and more or less striated, chiefly from the adjacent Coal
Measures, with a few red sandstones, conglomerates, and schists from the

West Highland border. Two grey sandstone boulders of considerable
size appeared on the sides of the well, one on the N.W. side and the other

nearly opposite on the S.E. side, at a depth of between 12 and 13 feet
from the surface.

    No trace of any shelly clay or of shells was found.

     Samples of all that could be obtained, viz. the boulder- clay, were
taken :

                  (1) From R depth of 14 feet to 14 feet 6 inches.

                        (2) ,, 14 feet G inches to 14 feet 11 inches.
                        (3) ,, 15 feet to 16 feet.

    On Monday, March 26, Mr. Home, Mr. Bell, and Mr. Dunlop again
met at the well, and in their presence the examination was carried down

another 2 feet, making the greatest depth reached about 17^ feet fi'om the
surface. Samples were then taken :

(4) From a depth of 10 feet to 17 feet.

(.5 and 6)  ,, 15 feet to 16 feet.

     Portions of the whole were despatched to Mr. David Robertson for
examination, and also to the office of the Geological Survey in Edinburgh,

     Mr. Robertson's report is subjoined.

                         2. Boring Ojyerations Around the Well.

     The result of the excavation of the well being so far negative, the
Committee deemed it advisable, lest former operations had removed or
concealed the shelly clay from the sides of the well, to put down some
bores at A^arious points at a short distance around it. For this purpose
they employed Mr. James Pollock, whose services had been obtained in
 their former investigations at Clava. Mr. Pollock was first instructed to
put down four bores at Aarious points around the well to a depth of about
 17 feet. The position of these bores (Nos. 1 to 4) is shown in the

 following diagram.

     The diameter of the well after the masonry had been removed was
4 feet 9 inches at the surface, and 4 feet 3 inches at a depth of 15 feet.

      The distances of the bores from the sides of the well were in each case
about 2^ feet.

     Owing to a large boulder, No. 4 bore had to be abandoned, and bores
4a and 4b weie put down first westward and then southward from No. 4

(see ' Borer's Journal ').

     After these bores had been put down and reported on by Mr. Pollock
it was suggested that, as a considerable space intervened between bores
Nos. 1 and 4, and again between Nos. 3 and 4, it was possible that a bed

of clay of some breadth might extend diagonally between these without

additional bores were also done by Mr. Pollock.

     Finally, another bore, No. 7, was put down from the bottom of the
well in order to reach the rock, which Sir A. Geikie had been informed
was 24 feet beneath the shelly clay.

    When the boring was in pi-ogress Mr. Macconochie, of the Geological

Survey, at the request of the Chairman, visited the spot to examine the
material and report if any change was observable. Mr. Dunlop and the
Secretary were also present.

Report on the ChaiJelhall Clay. By Mr. David Robertson, F.G.S.

                                                                            Millport, May 5, 1894.

    The samples of clay that were submitted to me for examination from

Chapelhall from depths of 14 to 17 feet were, as taken from the pit, of a

dark slatish colour, and when dry of a light grey colour. The mud

referred to in the following list is that portion of the clay that passed

through a sieve of 96 meshes to the inch, and the sand is what passed
through a sieve of 24 meshes to the inch, and the stones are those retained
in the same sieve. That whicli is commonly called ' floats ' is that which
rises to the surface of the water when the clay is dissolved, after having
been dried. The dissolved clay, when stirred up, retained its dark colour,
but after standing a little a reddish brown formed on the surface.

     The ' floats ' are not referred to in the subjoined list, as they were all
alike in being quite barren of animal remains, and almost of everything

else.

that we generally find in the post-Tertiary shell-bearing clays. The

samples of sand are of a very uniform colour, and any little variation that

appears may have been caused by the black grains being lighter and

coming more to the surface than the white in one case than another.
     From the abrasions on the above samples of coal, there can be little

doubt that it belonged to the deposit.

    As no rubbing is noticed on any of the pieces of slag, and the fractured

edges appearing sharp, it is most likely that it got into the clay accidentally.

At the same time it is curious that it is met with in so many of the

samples both of the pits and bores.
     So far as I can judge from the samples of the clay and the average

proportion of stones and mud, also the paucity of the floatings, and the
entire absence of animal remains (with the exception of a small fragment
of shell embedded in a piece of Carboniferous shale), I have no doubt
whatever that the deposit is characteristic boulder-clay.

--The Volcanic Phenomena of Vesuvius and its Neighbourhood. Report

    of the Committee, consistinrj of Mr. H. Bauerman, Mr. F. W.

     iluDLER, Mr. J. J. H. Teall, and Professor H. J. Johnston-
     Lavis. (Brawn up hy Professor H. J. Johnston-Lavis.)

   --Vesuvius. Since the last report lava has continued to pour forth from

the top of the new lava-cone in the Atrio del Cavallo, sometimes in small
quantities, at others in considerable abundance. On no occasion, how-

ever, did the lava issue beyond the limits that it had reached in the years

1891-92. In fact, the whole of that eastern part of the Atrio known as the
Val d'Inferno has not been invaded at all by the new lava during or
since its issue in the spring of 1891. The consequence of this has been

that it has continued to pile itself up around the line of fissure by which
it issued, and still further add to the dimensions of the great lava-cone
that it had built up in the Atrio. So great has this cone become that it
constitutes a prominent feature in the outline of the volcano as seen from

Naples. The eminence of Somma is separated from Vesuvius by the

depression of the Atrio. This notch, so to speak, in the general outline

was terminated below by an almost horizontal line, which is now replaced
by an obtuse cone, so that many people speak of three summits to the
Vesuvian volcano. This is rather an exaggeration, for although the new

lava-cone is of very considerable dimensions, for the time occupied in its
growth, yet it cannot compare with that of the cone of Vesuvius on one

side or the ridge of Somma on the other.
     The whole of this new cone is entirely built up of lava, by far the

greater part being of the j^ahoehoe or corded type ; only now and then
during marked activity has there been produced any lava with a rugged
scoriaceous surface. The occasion was therefore a very valuable one to

determine the slope of such a lava-cone. This was done only normally to
the line of fissure by which the lava issued, and which makes the cone ter-
minate in an elongated ridge rather than in a point. Practically all these
clinometric observations, which were taken with great care, gave angles
Aarying from 13° to 15°.

     Comparing this angle with that of .such mountains as Etna or

Mauna Loa, we must consider that both are composite cones, have experi-
enced many disturbing influences such as the formation of parasitic erup-

tive outlets from which lava streams have issued far away from the sum-

mit, and have thus diminished the general slope of the volcano. Those

mountains are usually considered to have an average slope of 10'^. The

Hawaiian lavas are, as is well known, exceptionally fluid, and we could

hardly expect cones of greater slope than 10^. At Etna the lavas have

always been more viscous from their lower temperature and the compound

or false viscosity given to them by the large number of porphyritic crystals

already existing in the magma at the time of emission, just as earth mixed
with water may produce a viscous mud. These new lavas of Vesuvius, as

is the case with all those that issue high up on the volcano and in small

quantities, were very viscous owing to their low temperature and advanced

·crystallisation, so that soon after the material poured out it was prevented

Wefrom flowing by slight further cooling.  may take therefore this aver-

age slope of 14° as the best and most correct estimate for a lava of this

nature.

This recent outflow exhibits most of the varieties of surface to be met

v/ith in the type of lava above mentioned, such as corded shapes of diflerent

kinds, irregular globular surfaces, sheets, and plates either in position or

reared on end, and tunnels of every variety, frequently with continua-

tions as walled canals, of which a good example is seen in the photograph

Aexhibited.  magnificent lava hump is to be seen in another photograpli,

and was formed right under the escarpment of Somma. The origin of

these humps is still obscure. They are common on most large flows of

corded lava of Vesuvius, but unfortunately 1 have never been present at

their formation, nor do I know of anyone who has.

The points of issue of the lava occurred at various spots along a line cor-

responding with the strike of the radial dyke to which it owes its origin, so
that the new lava has as a summit an irregular ridge running nearly north

and south. Of course the actual highest point is nearly always that where

the last lava issued. Generally more than one spot along this line gave out

lava at the same time. The fluid rock flowed sometimes on one side,

sometimes on the other, so that the general public at Naples were only

irom time to time treated to a glimpse of Nature's fireworks, and when the

lava flowed in the opposite direction it was often announced that it had

altogether stopped.

During the last year several new conical spiracles were formed, but

none of them comparable in perfection of form to those described in tlie

last two reports, or exhibiting equally interesting features.

    No very interesting minerals were produced as sublimates. In fact,

·OTily two species are worthy of mention. On one occasion a small quantity of

tenorite was formed in one of the spiracles. Soon after the lava had entirely

stopped flowing in February, sublimates of potash-bearing halite were

very abundant around about the vents, in beautiful fern-like skeletons, in

which a number of feathery branches radiated at right angles from a stem

representing usually about three edges of a cube, and were themselves so

many edges of smaller cubes. Sometimes this halite was grey, from minute

lirematite crystals being deposited with the salt, which likewise was in

:some cases greenish from copper impurities. Most, however, was of a

teautiful snow white. One small cave in particular, about the size of a

man's body, was clothed with the most glistening white lining, and from

the roof and walls showers of crystals fell from time to time. These were

not visibly red-hot in bright diflfused daylight, but looking towards the

shaded inner extremity of the cavity a bright red incandescence was visible.
ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF VESUVIUS.  317

In a short time, with suitable apparatus, I collected over two kilogrammes

of this material absolutely free from mechanical impurities.

     Along many of the cracks of the lava beautiful glassy crusts of halite,

more or less impure, were formed, and often showed a dull red heat in
daylight. These crusts on being removed become rapidly opaque and milky
in hue, and audibly cracked into starch-like columns, due to the rapid con-

--traction on cooling producing, in fact, a miniature basaltic structure.
     About February 5, 1894, the lava was issuing in very small quantity,

and by the 7th showed no trace of movement. Yet even in May cracks

in the lava near its point of exit were incandescent some distance in, and
the saline incrustations mentioned above were in full perfection.

      Coincident with the ai-rest of the lateral outflow, the lava rose in the
chimney and the red reflection from the top of Vesuvius that had been
absent for so long, with rare exceptions, was again almost daily visible.

The level of the lava in the main chimney soon rose to the bottom of the
new crater that had been forming, and increasing in size during the time
the lateral issue of la\a had been going on, and commenced the tilling up
of that cavity by the formation of a cone of eruption, so that almost coin-

cident with the arrest of the leakage of lava laterally the central activity
changed from the crater- and dust-forming stage to the lava cake- and
cone-forming stage.

     I made a careful examination of the summit of Vesuvius about the
middle of May. The crater in an east and west direction was about 150m.
in diameter, and its depth, then decreasing, was about the same. The
walls were remarkably steep, in some places even vertical or overhanging.
The bottom could be seen with difficulty owing to the crumbling nature
of the edges. The walls are nearly all covered by sublimates or dust
that has adhered and crusted them over, so that several dykes both .solid
and hollow can no longer be distinguished. This is especially the case
with the one formed during the 1891 outburst. The details of the great
rift of the 1880-81 and subsequent eruptions on the east side of the great
cone were still easily discernible. On the south side, and a little to the
east, a wall of rock stands out from the side of the crater and is directed
nearly towards the centre. It is capped by a pinnacle of rock, and is really
the old dyke of the 1 885 eruption.

     Just to the east of that wall, and partly owing to its existence, the slope

of the inside of the crater is less in that direction. Here the guides had

made a little path for a few metres down. On examining carefully the

condition of things from its lower termination, which so far aided little
the view of what was going on at the crater-bottom, I found that by ex-

tending it down a slope, and then cutting a ledge farther round to the

east at a suitable point, a bracket-like platform some metres square could
be reached, which is about half-way down the crater. Later the path was

further widened by me and made more commodious, and now gives easy

access to the platform from which one can look right into the vent of the vol-
cano and watch with ease the boiling up of the lava and the ejection of the
great blobs and cakes that are rapidly filling up the crater. Unfortunately,
owing to the well-like shape of tlie crater, the shadows due to the vapour
column spreading out overhead, and the dark colour of the rocks, instan-
taneous photography could not be utilised to record this interesting and
ever-changing scene.

    As is usual at some period after an eruption, feathery gypsum is a
common product in the cavities of the old scoriae, and is associated at the

AIn the Campi Phlegraei little of novelty has come to light.  tunnel

of sufficient completeness to be yet worth recording.

     consisting of Professor A. C. Haddon, Professor 6. B. Howes,
     Mr. W. E. HoYLE, Mr. I. C. Thompson, Mr. A. 0. Walker,

    and Professor W. A. Herdman (Chairman and Reporter).

                                               [PLATE LJ

The work has chiefly been carried out by the three last-named members

of the Committee along with their colleagues of the Liverpool Marine
Biology Committee and other naturalists who have been working at the
Port Erin Biological Station during the year. The present report is
drawn up by the Chairman, with contributions from the various specialists
mentioned below in connection with the several groups of animals. The
extensive lists and notes received from Mr. Walker and Mr. Thompson
should be specially acknowledged.

     The limits and more prominent physical features of the region of the
Irish Sea which this Committee was appointed to explore were sufficiently
described iii last year's report, and may be readily seen from the accom-
panying chart (Plate I.), which is a modiflcation, with some additions, of

the chart given in tlie former report.

     The work this year, in addition to the further exploration of the
district by dredging, trawling, and tow-netting, for the purpose of adding

to the records of the fauna, has consisted largely of the determination of the

--submarine deposits spread over the floor of the Irish Sea their nature,

probable origin, relation to depth, and effect upon the distribution of the
fauna. The reasons for undertaking this extension of the work were

      1. There can be no doubt that the nature of the bottom has a profound
influence upon the assemblage of animals at a particular spot, and limits,

perhaps, as much as any other factor the distribution of noii-pelagic

species in the sea.

      2. That being so, it becomes of importance to determine, if possible,

why there is a particular deposit at a special spot, and how much connec-

tion there is between the geological formations of a shore and the sub-
marine deposits lying ofl' that coast.

     3. Some of the deposits described in our last report proved of such
interest to the geologists at the Nottingham meeting that the Committee
of Section C supported the application for the reappointment of this
committee on the grounds that a collection of typical deposits from the
floor of the Irish Sea would be of geological interest. Sir Archibald
Geikie asked that such a series should be formed and sent to the Jermyn
Street Museum ; so on all the expeditions during this year sample bags of
the deposits met with have been preserved, and, after examination, have
been sent up to the Geological Survey. These deposits will be discussed

in a later part of the report.

     The object of the Committee, then, has been, not merely to collect
animals, but to investigate the condition of the sea-bottom in the various
parts of the area, and correlate, if possible, the fauna with the environment.

shore-collecting at the southern end of the Isle of Man, and hired the
steam trawler ' Lady Loch ' for two days' dredging. On the first day the

floor of the sea to the north of Port Erin from Fleshwick to Contrary

Head at Peel was worked at twelve stations within four miles of the coast,

identified), including Asco2)odaria nodosa, hydroids (fifteen species identi-

fied), including Dicoryne conferta, new to the district ; also the cumacean
Campylasjns inacrojjhthalma, Sars, new to Britain.

    It may be of some use to place on record the course of procedure at

each dredging station on these expeditions. The plan for the day is
arranged with the captain of the steamer, and when the first locality is
reached the spot is determined on tlie chart, and the depth verified by
casting the lead. Then the dredge (measuring 2 feet G inches by 1 foot,
and weighing from 30 to 40 lbs.) is sent down with a tow-net tied on to
the line about two fathoms from tlie dredge. Very often a smaller di'edge
with a bag of cheese-cloth is sent over on the other side of the ship. One
or more surface tow-nets are also put out. The tow-nets, both surface and
deep, are looked after by Mr. I. C. Thompson, who, after hauling them,
first tui'ns out their contents into a clear glass jar of sea- water, and then,

after noting the general character of the catch and any specially conspicu-
ous forms, strains off the water through a small bag made of very fine
miller's silk, and then transfers the 'plankton' left adhering to the silk

into a tube containing a special preservative fluid formed chiefly of spirit,
glycerine, and water.

    When the dredge is brought up it is emptied on deck, and after a note

of the general character of the deposit and assemblage of animals has been
taken, any specially large or rare specimens are picked out and transferred
to buckets or jars of sea-water or to store-bottles of spirit. Then the heap
is spread out so as to form a layer not more than one or two inches in

depth, and one or two members of the Committee (Professor Herdman and
another) now settle down beside it to pass the entire mass in review inch

by inch, working it across a .small space of bare deck and turning over
every shell, stone, and specimen with an iron spoon, so as to ensure that
nothing escapes observation and due record in the note-book. In the
meantime the contents of the bottom tow-net have been dealt with by
Mr. Thompson, and the apparatus has been lowered for a second haul, or

the vessel is steaming on to a new locality. Then Professor Herdman

selects a fair sample of the deposit for preservation (for the Geological

Survey) in a small canvas bag (10 x5 inches), care being taken to include

some of tlie characteristic bottom animals-- sliells, ophiuroids, puly/oa, Arc.
After this sample has been removed and any special animals required liave
been picked out and put into store bottles, the whole of the remainder of

the haul is passed gradually through our set of three sieves (meshes inch,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      jf

^ inch, and -^ inch respectively), which work up and down in a tall iron
cylinder filled with sea-water. The sieves are disconnected and examined
at intervals, and in this way many of the smaller animals of all groups
are detected and picketl out. Finally, the water in which the sieves have
been plunging is all strained by Mr. Thompson through his fine silk net,
and in this way many of the rarer bottom Copepoda are obtained, while
the finer sandy and muddy deposits retained by the finest sieve or in the
bottom of the cylinder are packed in canvas bags by Mr. Alfred Leicester
for further examination at home. These contain, of course, many minute
Mollusca, Ostracoda, and Foi-aminifera. By the time all these processes
have been completed the dredge has usually been hauled again, and a
fresh heap is lying on the deck awaiting investigation. On a successful
trip the members of the party, on an average four to six in number, are
kept constantly occupied, each man at his own work, from the commence-
ment of the first haul till the steamer is turned homewai'ds, and after that
the packing and labelling of specimens fill up the time until land is

reached.

                                    ADDITIONS TO THE FAUNA.

As most of the expeditions took place round the Isle of Man the

material was generally brought back to the Port Erin Biological Station,

and sorted out into groups in the laboratory there, and then sent to the

specialists. Taking tlie groups in zoological order the most notable

additions as the result of this year's work have been

   --Sponges. Dr. R. Hanitsch reports that the only actual addition to

our sponge fauna made during the last few months is Leiosella [Spongio-

'iielJa) jyulchella, Sowerby, which was dredged on May 14, 1894, at 14 miles
N. by W. from the Liverpool N.W. Lightship. This species was previously

known from the coast of Durham, the Skerries, Shetland, the west coast

Aof Ireland, the east coast of Greenland, and the North Pacific.  few

other doubtful species await further investigation.

   We are indebted for a list of the Hydroid Zoophytes and Polyzoa

which we have collected to Miss L. R. Thoniely, who has proved that the

Lofoea pigmrra of Alder possesses an operculum, and therefore Ijelongs to

the genus CalycdJa, and also has Gonothecaj which were previously un-

known. The total number of species of hydroids in our area is now eiglity-

uine, and the last dredging expedition has given us an interesting addition

to our fauna in Dlcoryne conferta^ which was growing on an Aporrluiis
shell ; it was only known previously from Cullercoats, Orkney, and
Shetland. Of polyzoa 123 species and fourteen varieties have now been

recorded. The most recent find is Crisia ramosa, which was I'ecently de-
scribed by Harmer from Plymouth, and which we find also at Port Erin.

Mr. E. T. Browne has, during some visits to Port Erin, paid special

attention to the Medus.e, and has kindly supplied us with a list of a

dozen species, one of which, Amphicodoii fritillaria, has not previou.sly

been recorded for British seas. He has also found on .several occasions a

Siphonopliore (probably Halistemma) in Port Erin Bay and Lesueuria

vitrea, both new to our district, a7id the Ilalistemma, probably an addition

to the British fauna.

In regard to the Copepoda, Mr. I. C. Thompson has drawn up a

general report upon the additions to our knowledge of the group (see

p. 325) ; while Mr. Andrew Scott, ' fisheries ' assistant to Professor
Herdman, has supplied the following notes upon some new species of

Ectinosonm and other Copepoda, at which he has been specially working :
-- A' Longipedia miliar (T. and A. Scott).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            few specimens of this species

were collected by hand-net in the I'ock-pools at Hilbre Island in March.

It is easily distinguished from L. coronata (Glaus) by its much smaller

size.

   --^ Ectinosoma Normani, n. sp. (T. and A. Scott). Several specimens of

this Ectuiosoma were obtained in material from Barrow Channel collected

by Professor Herdman in May. When fresh this species has a brilliant

red spot on the lower angles of the cephalothorax, and in this respect it

agrees with E. erythrops, Brady.

   --' Ectinosoma Herdmani, n. sp. (T. and A. Scott). This species was

found in considerable numbers in the stomachs of young dabs {J^leuronectes

limanda) sent to the fisheries laboratory from Blackpool, as many as

Wesixteen specimens being obtained from a single stomach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          have also

obtained specimens of this new species from the Firth of Forth.

   --' Ectinosoma gracile, n. sp. (T. and A. Scott). One or two specimens

of this species were obtained among dredged material collected at Port

Erin by Professor Herdman, Easter, 1894.

  --' Ectinosoma pygmamm, n. sp. (T. and A. Scott). This species was

obtained from the same material as the last, and is the smallest Ectino-

soma known to us : it measures only J^^h of an inch ("33 mm.).
-- A' Bradya minor, n. sp. (T. and A. Scott).'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            few specimens of this new

Bradya were obtained in rock-pools at Hilbre Island, along with Longipedia

minor.

     ' 1 he above species of Ectiiiosiima and Bradya are fig^ured and described in a
revision of the British species of Copepoda belonging to the two genera Ectinosoma
and Bradya, bj- T. and A. Scott, which is to be published at an earlj' date.

-- A' Bactylopus rostralus (T. Scott).                                single specimen was obtained

among some dredged material collected at Port Erin by Professor

Herdman, Easter, 1894.
-- A' Pseudanthessius Scmvagei (Canu).
                                                                      few specimens were obtained

by washing a number of Spatangiis pur^nire^is which were trawled in

the central area, 21 miles W.N.W. from Morecambe Bay Lightship, on

April 3. This rare species was only added to the British fauna last year,

when it was found in the Firth of Forth, and the present is the second

time it has been observed in the British area.'

Mr. Thompson reports as follows :

' Eleven species of Copepoda new to the district have been recorded

during tlie past year, viz., Cyclops magnoctavus, Cragin ; Cyclops Ewarti,

Brady                            Caiiuella perplexa, Scott ;  Ameira  longicandata, Scott ;  Acontio-
                              ;

phori'S elongatus, Scott ; Ectinosoma Uerdmani, Scott ; Ectinosoma Nor-

mani,  Scott ;                   Ectinosoma  elongata, Scott ;        Cancerilla tuhulata, Dalzell
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

Lepeoptheirus jicctoralis, and Anchorella appendix. Also one species new to

science, viz., Fseudocyclopia stephoides, n. sp. This crustacean has not yet

been described, but its description and figure will be shortly published in

the " Transactions of the Liverpool Biological Society." It combines some

of the characters of the genus Stephos with those of Fseudocyclopia, the

latter predominating sufficiently to determine its position in that genus.

'Surface tow-nets have been continuously employed during the several

marine expeditions undertaken by the Committee, also tow-nets attached

to the rope a few fathoms above the dredge. The latter device has

proved a success, collecting some good species of Copepoda as well as

Cumacea and Amphipoda, which are seldom or never obtained on the

surface. Amongst the Copepoda thus obtained were several specimens of

Pseudocalanus armatus, found along with a shoal of Pseiidocalanus elon-

Agatus.                          widely extending shoal of Anomalocera Patersonii was observed

off the Isle of Man in May, the only occasion on which we have taken this

species during the year. On several occasions, notably in the early part

of June, the surface organisms have been singularly scarce.

' Special care has been taken to wash and sieve through fine silk as

much as possible of the material brought up by the dredge during marine

expeditions, and it is by this means that several of the above-mentioned
Copepoda new to the district have been obtained, as well as the new

species Pseudocyclopia stephoides. Large quantities of ophiuroids, chiefly

Ophiocoma nigra and 0})hiothrixfragilis, are amongst the dredged material,

and it is probably from one or other of these that the two specimens of

Cancerilla tuhulata, Dalyell, a male and female, were taken, as the species

is parasitic on ophiuroids. The first record of this rare copepod occurs in
Dalyell's " Powers of the Creator," 1851, and it has since been taken by

Mr. Gamble at Plymouth, and by Mr. Scott in the Forth, but not before

in our district. Cyclojis magnoctavus, Cragin, was found along with

quantities of Temorella affinis and Tachidius hrevicornis in tow-nettings

taken by Mr. Ascroft in low- water marine pools at Lytham. These being

brackish species, it is evident that a considerable amount of fresh water

finds its way into the Lytham pools.
     ' Cyclops Eivarti, Brady, although first taken in the Forth estuary, was

suspected by Brady to have a fresh-water origin. Ours are evidently

strictly marine, two specimens, both males, having been dredged at 20

fathoms by Mr. Thompson off Port Erin.

' Professor Herdman's fish laboratory has yielded two species of parasitic

Copepoda, viz., LepeoptlipArus jyRcloralis, found on the flounder, taken off
Morecambe, and also from Arnofflossiis mcgastoiua, and Aucliorella appendix
from the ^ills of the hake.'

     Mr, A. O. Walker reports as follows ujDon the Highek Crustacea :

     ' Collections have been examined from the following places, viz.
      '1. Off Port Erin at various points, dredged in (usually) 10 to 20

fathoms by Professor Herdman and Mr. I. C. Thonij^son in August and
September 1893, and March 1894.

     ' 2. Off the Little Ornie, North Wales, 5 to 10 fathoms, in October
1893 (drfidged by A. O. W^alker).

     ' 3. In the Menai Straits, near the Suspension Bridge (both above and

below), on i^pril 2 and May 31, 1894 (dredged by A. O. Walker).

     ' The following additions have been made to the list published in last

year's report.

Turning now to the submarine deposits, the determination and dis-

tribution of which the Committee feel to be a vei-y important part of their

work, it is still too soon to attempt anything like a detailed account of

the floor of the Irish Sea, but still sufficient observations have perhaps

been made to warrant the following preliminary account. The accom-

panying chart (Plate I.) shows the zones of depths in the district, 0-10

fathoms, 10-20 fathoms, 20-50 fathoms, and upwards of .50 fathoms, being

separated from one another. At those places where the Committee (or the

Liverpool Marine Biology Committee) have obtained samples of the bottom,

YYand    shell concretions. The cliief conclusions we have arrived at so

far are :

     1. The most extensive shallow-water deposit is sand. In most
localities along the coast of Lancashire, Cheshire, and North Wales, from

the sea-shore out to the 10-fathom contour the bottom is formed of more

or less pure quartz sand. Occasionally in spots there are local patches of

stones,  of shells,  or of  mud                       but these can  generally be accounted for  by
                                                   ;

tidal or estuarine currents, by the entrance of fresh- water streams carrying

down alluvium, or by the presence of littoral or sub-littoral boulder clay.

These spots are all, however, of small area, and the great extent of the

bottom down to 10 fathoms is sand.

2. Further out, however, between 10 and 20 fathoms, the sand becomes,

greatly mixed with mud, and much diversified by large tracts of shelly

deposits or by patches of gravel, and the fauna on the bottom also becomes,

much more abundant. In some spots, at about 20 fathoms, it is made up

over considerable areas almost entirely of ophiuroids (Ophiocoma nigra and

Ophiothrix fragilis), which fill the dredge haul after haul. At two localities,
off the Isle of Man, viz., along the east coast from Clay Head to St. Ann's
Head, and off the west coast between Contrary Head and Niarbyl, at

depths between 10 and 20 fathoms, are great nullipore deposits formed

of Melobesia and Lithoihamnion, which have a most characteristic appear-

ance, smell, and fauna.

This area of the sea-bottom, from 10 to 20 fathoms, extends across

from the north of Lancashire to the Isle of Man, so that opposite Barrow,

for example, there is a wide extent of about 50 miles in length of sea-floor

at depths of not more than 15 or 16 fathoms (see section at foot of

Plate I.).

     3. Depths of over 20 fathoms are only found to the west, north, and

south of the Isle of Man (see Chart, Plate I.) ; and depths of from 20 to

50 fathoms give us the most vai'ied bottom deposits and the richest fauna.

As a rule the sand is more or less mixed with mud, and as the bottom,

goes deeper the amount of mud gets greater. When there is a consider-
able admixture of mud with coarse sand, that forms what is known to the

trawlers as a ' reamy ' bottom, and that is the ground upon which the sole

and some other fish are generally found spawning.

Siiells and other hard parts of animals play an important part in the

deposits at depths of about 20 fathoms and upwards. In places the dredge

comes up filled with Pecten shells, dead and alive, chiefly P. opercidaris

and P. maximus. At other places the deposit is practically composed of the

shells of Pectuncuhis ghjcimeris. These and other shell beds form a rich

collecting ground to the naturalist, as they support an abundant and varied

fauna. Zoophytes and polyzoa are attached to the shells, and these serve

as shelter for nudibranchs and other small mollusca, worms, and ascidians.

(_)n the whole the heterogeneous deposits support a richer fauna than do

tlie homogeneous deposits, such as sand or mud, and it is chiefly in the
zone of depth we are now considering that the heterogeneous deposits,

occur.

4. The depths over 50 fathoms contain a pure dark bluisli grey mud

which is very tenacious, and sets when dried into a firm clay. This is

abominable stuff" to dredge in and to work with on deck. It clings to every-

thing that touches it : it is almost impossible to see what is in it, and to

get the animals out of it uninjured ; it is too solid for the sieves, and the
                       --

hose can be played upon masses of it almost indefinitely without dissolving
it. The fauna of this zone is, in our district, quite peculiar and character-
istic. In its shallower parts, about 50 fathoms, it contains great numbers

of living and dead TurriteUa terehra, upon many of which are attached one,

two, or three specimens of the little red anemone Sagartia Herdmani,

                                Fig. 2. Sagartia Herdmani (Haddon).

Haddon. In its deeper parts, up to 80 fathoms, are found Calocaris

MacandrciP, Ilyalincecia hihicola, a small Lumbriconei-eis, Panthalis

Oerstedi, Lijjobranchius Jeffreysii, Brissopsis lyrifera, Aviphiura Chiajii,

and Isocardia cor. Great quantities of large sausage-like muddy tubes,

formed of stratified layers of interlacing threads of mucus in wliich the

mud particles are closely entangled, are brought up in the dredge. These

are almost certainly the tubes of Panthalis Oerstedi, and the living annelid

has several times been found in the tubes, but most of those we dredge

up are empty, and the tubes are certainly far more numerous than the

worms. Possibly the explanation is that the Panthalis forms a tube as it

· lies in the mud, and then when it moves away leaves its tube behind it

(one can scarcely imagine the animal dragging such a tube through this

tenacious deposit), and after a time forms another in a new situation.

These are the leading conclusions we have come to so far in regard to

the distribution of submarine deposits in our area. Two further questions
--now present themselves : first, the biological one the effect upon the
--fauna
                            ;
and secondly, the  geological one  the origin of the deposits.          In

regard to the importance of the nature of the bottom to the animals living

upon it there can be no doubt. Probably the nature of the deposit is the

most important of the various factors that determine the distribution of

animals over the sea-bottom within one zoological area. It is certainly

more important than mere depth ; a muddy bottom will support a similar

fauna at ten fathoms in one place and at fifty fathoms in another. Pro-

bably the most important influence in the environment of a lower animal

is its food, and once beyond the narrow sub -littoral zone in which algse

--flourish and to which, of course, certain pliytophagous animals must be
--restricted it is probably chiefly the nature of the bottom which deter-

mines the food.^ Many animals feed upon the deposit, others browse upon

the polj'zoa and zoophytes which can only attach themselves and grow

where there are sufficiently large objects, such as shell valves, from which

they can get the necessary stability ; while others, again, feed upon their
neighbours, which subsist on the deposit or are attracted by the zoophytes,

<tc. ; for example, soles are frequently caught upon ground (known to

fishermen as ' sole ground ') where Flustra foliacea lives in abundance, and

the probable connection is that the fish are dependent upon the numerous

a,mphipoda and other small animals which frequent the tufts of Flustra.

The same locality may vary so much from time to time in the temperature,

the salinity, and the transparency of the water, that it is probable that

     ' The only food supply quite independent of the bottom is dead pjankton, from

the water above, which may reach the bottom uneaten.
                                                            --

ox THE MARINE ZOOLOGY OK THE IRISH SEA.                     331

none of these factors^so long as the variations do not exceed certain

--limits have so much influence upon the fauna as the nature of the deposit

has. It is therefore quite to be expected that the fauna sliould vary from

place to place with the nature of the bottom, and that is what we have
observed frequently in our work round the Isle of Man. In practically

the same water, identical in temperature, salinity, and transparency, at the

same depth, with, so far as one can see, all the other surrounding con-

ditions the same, the fauna varies from place to place witli changes in the

--bottom mud, sand, nullipores, and shell beds, all have their characteristic

assemblages of animals.

As to the further, and very important, question of the origin of the

deposits, that is partly a geological inquiry, and one which cannot, until

we have accumulated a much larger series of observations, be fully dis-

cussed ; but there are a few matters which may be briefly pointed out as

givdng some idea of the range and bearing of the question.

1. It is necessaiy to make a most careful examination of the deposits.
AFor example, all muds are not the same in origin.
                                                    deposit of mud may

be due to the presence of an eddy or a sheltered corner in which the finer

particles suspended in the water are able to sink, or it may be due to the

wearing away of a limestone beach, or to quantities of alluvium brought

down by a stream from the land, or to the presence of a submerged bed of

boulder clay, or, finally, in some places to the sewage and refuse from

coast towns.

   We2. have kept in view the possibility of some correlation between

the geological formations along the beach and the submarine deposits
lying off the shore. There is no doubt that the nature of the rock forming
the shore has a great influence upon the marine fauna, and has some-

times some effect upon the neighbouring deposits. For example, the

contrast between the deposits lying oft" the two prominent headlands, the
Great Orme, in North Wales, and Bradda Head, in the Isle of Man, is

well marked. The Great Orme is composed of mountain limestone, and

the result of its weathering and erosion is that large blocks are found

lying scattered outside its base on the fine sand ; but there is no deposit
of smaller stones, gravel, and resulting sand farther out, probably because

in the wearing of the rock and the large detached blocks by the sea a great

deal is removed in solution and the rest in suspension as very fine mud

this we have found to be the case round Puffin Island, which is also

mountain limestone. Bradda Head, on the other hand, is a schistose
metamorphic Silurian rock, which breaks up into large fragments, and

these into smaller, and so forms deposits of dark slatey more or less
angular gravel, and then very coarse sand, extending for some way out from

the foot of the cliff.

     The influence of the shore rocks upon the littoral fauna is an important

subject upon which we have accumulated some observations ; but the
matter requires further work and detailed discussion, and must be left

over for a future report.

     3. Probably the great bulk of the siliceous sand which forms so large

--a part of the floor of our sea is derived proximately whatever may have

--been its ultimate source ' from the great deposits of drift which were

formed in the neighbourhood during the Glacial period, and large tracts of

which may since have been broken up by the sea.

' Probably, to a great extent, Triassic sandstones.
             -- ---

4. As examples of a few peculiar and specially noteworthy deposits

which are not simply * terrigenous ' in their origin, the following may be

mentioned :

South-east of the Calf Sound, about two miles out, at a depth of 20

fathoms, there is a white shelly sand which seems to be almost wholly

composed of animal remains. There are broken fragments of the lamelli-

branchs Pecten, Auomia, Pectunctdus, Mactra, Venus, and Mytilus, of the

gastropods Cyprcea, Buccinum, Emarginula, Purpura, and Trochus, of

various calcareous polyzoa such as Cellariajistulosa, Cellepora pumicosa,

and lepralids, of Balanus and Serpula, and of various echinoderm plates

and spines, and the whole shells of Echinocymnus pusillus. The deposit,
when it comes up in the dredge, is of a gleaming whiteness, and has a very

characteristic appearance. Such a deposit as this would form a rock

almost wholly made up of fossils, and might compare well with some

Tertiary fossiliferous deposits, such as the Coralline Crag.

   A little further north, along the east coast of the Isle of Man, at

about a corresponding depth and distance from land, we meet with a

purely vegetal deposit formed of the nullipores Lithothaninion and

Melobesia. On the other side of the island, again, between Port Erin and

the Calf, at a depth of 18 fathoms, there is a tract of sea-bottom which,

when brought up on deck, looks at the first glance like a peculiarly fibrous

sand, but a closer examination shows that it is entirely composed of the

comminuted plates, and especially the spines of echinids, chiefly Spatangus.

The variety that is noticed in submarine deposits round the Isle of Man,

from depths of 15 to 35 fathoms, as brought up in the dredge is very

striking. It is remarkable how differing proportions in the mixtures of

sand, gravel, and shells give I'ise to very difierent colours and general

appearance in the mass. As seen when tumbled out of the dredge on to

the deck, some deposits are white, some yellow, some grey, some reddish,

of various tints from pink to ruddy brown, and others darker, of all

shades of brown and dark grey. It is curious how, even in a compo-

site deposit made up of many different constituents, there is usually a pre-

vailing tint ; for example, the bottom at Station 6 on May 27, although

composed (see p. 321) of mud, sand, nullipores, shells, and stones, was dis-

tinctly of a rich ruddy brown tint. The importance of this presence of

prevailing colours in the various submarine deposits is obvious in its

bearing upon the colours and habits of animals.

Another very remarkable sea-bottom is one which takes the form of

irregular calcareous masses, cementing together the dead shells and sand

grains which are lying on the bottom, and making lumps like 'clinkers.'

Hence the spot whei-e it is found is called by the trawlers the ' Black

smitli's Shop.' It is about 25 miles S.S.W. of the Calf of Man (see

PL I.), in ordinary clear weather the Chicken Rock Lighthouse just

dipping and the stack at Holyhead just rising above the water, and the

Wedepth is about 25 fathoms.  have also heard of a similar bottom of

cemented shells between Ramsey and North Lancashire. Mr. Leicester

has found the following shells in the concretions : Pecten opercularis,

Cyprina islandica, Venus lincta, Cardium echinatum, Niicida niicleus,

Scrobiodaria alba, Lucina borealis, and Turritella terebra. There is

a line lump of this deposit in the Biological Station at Port Erin, and

Ave have presented another piece to the Jermyn Street Museum in
London. Mr. W. W. Watts, of the Geological Survey, has made a

careful examination by thin sections of the latter specimen, and he has

amination shows that it is practically a fine-grained grit made up of the

usual constituents of fragmental rocks cemented together, the cement

being in greater quantity than the grains. These grains are chiefly chips

of quartz, but I have also seen microcline, orthoclase felspar, plagioclase
felspar, brown mica, a tew grains of glauconite, and green and brown

pseudomorphs, probably after grains of some ferro-magnesian mineral

like augite, hornblende, or even possibly olivine-- which it is impossible

now to° say, but I think most probably hornblende. There are one or

two opaque grains, and several clear grains containing a good deal of

minute magnetite.  The       grains  vary  in    size within small         limits                              the
                                                                                                            ;

largest I have measured is 0-02 inch and the smallest 002 inch, but the

average size would be about 0-004-0-005 inch in longest diameter. They

are therefore minute grains, and, as might be expected, extremely angular,

not one in a hundred showing rounded outlines. They are chiefly such

o-rains as would come from the denudation of granitic rocks or sediments

derived from them.
     ' The cement is carbonate of lime, with a small impurity of carbonate of

iron, present chiefly in certain layers, but not there in any considerable
quantity. The cement is clearly crystalline in immediate contact with the
grains, and also where lining cracks and cavities. Elsewhere it is more

opaque, and less conspicuously crystalline. The section cuts across
numerous shell fragments and a few polyzoa, and where there are any
hollow structures, as in the inside of lamellibranchs or gastropods, they

are filled up with a substance indistinguishable from the bulk of the

concretion.

     ' The specimen shows no particular reason for the local deposit^ of
cement, and the other constituents are doubtless the ordinary materials
of the sea-bed. I cannot find any evidence that the cementing is due to

any organic agency, and the thoro'.ighly well-developed crystals of car-

bonate of lime quite agree with this. It may be that the Carboniferous

limestone crops out on the sea-bottom under the deposit, and, if so, there
would very likely be submarine springs laden with carbonate of lime

which might be precipitated there under less pressure or local loss of

carbonic acid. It may be added that Mr. Clement Reid could not see in

the specimen any identifiable shells of other than recent age.'

      Another possible explanation is that the smaller calcareous particles
on the bottom have been dissolved in the sea-water and then re-deposited
so as to cement together the larger shells and the sand grains.

     As was mentioned earlier in the report, sample bags of all the more
important submarine deposits we have come upon have been sent, at
Sir Archibald Geikie's request, to the Museum of the Geological Survey
in Jermyn Street. They are being examined there by Mr. Clement
Reid, F.'G.S., who writes the following preliminary note in regard to

them :

' On comparing these samples with British deposits of Tertiary date

one finds a marked diflference in lithological character. Dredgings from

the Irish Sea, and also from the North Sea, are characterised by a

much coarser and more gravelly texture than one would expect at such

<iepths-- coarser, in fact, than one finds in Pliocene deposits, yielding a
A.similar fauna, indicating similar or even smaller depths.
                                                                           glance at

these dredgings shows the reason of this, for they are largely composed

of unworn or little-worn fragments of rock, often entirely encrusted by
--334 REPORT 1894.

organic growth. The stones evidently have not been transported far by
water, or they would be well rounded, like the pebbles found in our
Eocene lieds. The encrusting organisms show also that the fragments
have lain undisturbed on the sea-bed, yet they have often been derived
from far-distant sources. Though no Glacial strise were observed, and no
undoubted sub-fossil arctic shells have yet been found at these localities,
yet there seems little doubt that the bulk of the material on the sea-
bottom over this area has been derived from the breaking up of pre-

existing Glacial deposits. This may occur at a depth of several fathoms
through the gradual washing away of the muddy and sandy matrix of a

boulder clay or Glacial gravel. Coarse gravel is thus caused to accu-

mulate at a spot where the currents may be too feeble to transport

anything but sand.
      ' This sulimarine origin of angular gravel deposits should not be for-

&gotten, for it affects the lithological character of the sea-bottom over

most of the area which was formerly glaciated, even as far south as

Cornwall. On the other hand, it does not affect, except to a small

extent, the sea-bed beyond the former limit of the ice, and it does not

affect pre-Glacial deposits. Thus we must always expect to find at
similar depths the same fauna associated with deposits of finer texture
as soon as we leave the glaciated area, or when we go back into Tertiary

times.

      ' It is also worth noting that the occurrence of a stony bottom at

--twenty or thirty fathoms where normally there Avould be no deposit
--coarser than sand will probably lead to a disproportionate increase of

all encrusting organisms, and of all organisms needing a solid base. TJiis
lias certainly taken place, as anyone studying our shoal-water Tertiary
deposits will have observed. They contain few stones, and though each

stone or dead shell may be covered with encrusting organisms, yet the

relative proportion of these to the free forms is far smaller than seems

commonly to be the case in the seas that now wash our shores. The
sole exception to this rule among the British Tertiary strata is found in

the Coralline Crag, in which the contemporaneous consolidation of the
limestone was sufficient to provide the necessary solid base for tlio
encrusting and fixed organisms so abundant in that deposit.'

In conclusion, it is clear that this investigation of oar modern sul)-

marine deposits, their distribution, nature, origin, and associated fauna,

has geological applications, and that our results may be of some importance

to palaeontologists in determining the conditions under which the faun;i

of a particular horizon existed in the past ; but, from our point of view,

Wethe matter is a purely Biological one.  consider it of primary impor-

tance, in studying the distribution of the marine animals in our district, to

investigate as minutely as possible their environment, and that not merely

because it gives us some of the factors and possibly the explanation of the

distribution, but also on account of the light it may throw upon the

habits, variations, and other important characteristics of the species.

defray part of the expenses of the dredging expeditions.

During the past year the table hired by the British Association in the
Naples Zoological Station has been occupied by Mr. J. E. S. Moore, and
your Committee have pleasure in directing attention to the important in-

vesti<'ations carried on by him, and to the carefully worked-out results
which are indicated in the accompanying report sent in by Mr. Moore.

In the opinion of your Committee this report alone is sufficient to justify

them in strongly recommending the renewal of the grant.

    An application for permission to use the table during the ensuing year

for a period of six months, commencing at the end of September, has been
received from Mr. M. D. Hill, who wishes to continue his researches on
fertilisation in the eggs of 'Echinoderms, MoUusks, and Annelids. Your

Committee hope that the Association, by continuing the hire of a table as
in previous years, will enable them to afford to their applicant and to

other British naturalists the chance of participating in the advantages of
this justly predominant and well-managed institution. In further support

of this expression the Committee beg to lay before the Council the cogent

remarks of Professor Anton Dohrn contained in the following letter
addressed to their Secretary. This letter furnishes at the same time a

-- --report by the one best qualified to give it of the present position of the

station, as well as a statement of its claims upon the naturalists of other
countries, and especially upon all broad-minded scientific workers who

   --Dear Mr. Sladen, To give in a few words my report on the progress

of the Naples Zoological Station, I may be permitted to say, ' Vivit, floret,

crescit ' in all its parts.

     In fact, this is the plain truth : the life of the station is best proved

by the number of those who use its opportunities for research ; its flourish-
ing state by the quality and the quantity of scientific publications produced
there in the course of one year ; and its growth by tlie addition of new
arrangements for library, laboratory, and administration. As figures speak
for themselves, I may add that 800/. sterling have been spent this year for

the latter purpose alone.

     All tliis is too well known by those who take an interest in the
development of this institution to require a new or detailed explanation.
What is less generally known, but often considered by the best and most

confiding friends of the Zoological Station as the greatest drawback and
;3o6 REPORT-- 1894.

·danger in its whole constitution, is the uncertainty in which its future

lies. The fact that individual initiative and individual responsibility have

hitherto been appealed to exclusively for the existence of the Zoological

Station has caused in many minds apprehension as to what might befall

such a highly complex organisation if individual initiative and responsi-

bility should become unable, by the natural course of events, to guarantee

its further development, and even its existence.

    At the last International Medical Congress in Rome a voice was heard

pointing out the danger which threatened the Zoological Station, and this

voice was that of my friend Professor Michael Foster, of Cambridge. I

venture to make a few remarks on what my friend Foster said on that

-- --occasion. Speaking of the desirability nay, the necessity of inter-

Annational organisation, he said : '  example of this is the work done at the

Zoological Station at Naples. This is in reality an international institution,

although it has been chiefly originated by one man ; such an institution

ought to be international, and ought not to depend for its existence upon

the energy of one man.' In thanking Professor Foster heartily for the

credit which he gives me for originating the station, I must after all
express my belief that the Zoological Station will, even in the future, find
it safest to depend uj^on one man's energy, if the one man is ready and

-able to take upon himself the burden of the responsibility. It will take

--some time before the ideal of which Professor Foster spoke 'international
-- Weorganisation of science ' can be realised.
                                                 are still too deeply imbued

with national prejudice and national ambition to acknowledge readily any

scheme which might be offered to help science by combined international

action. I have had on many occasions to experience the power of these

influences during my career at the head of the Zoological Station, and

even now I can hardly say that the character attributed by Professor

Foster to the Zoological Station is so firmly established as to justify fully

the title international. De facto it is Germany which pays half the sum

necessary for the maintenance of the Zoological Station at Naples, though

Germany does not claim any privilege over other contributors. I ti'ied to

arrange with the Prussian Ministry of Public Instruction for a transfer of

mythe direction of the station in case of  death or inability ; it was not,

however, accepted on account of the difhculty of governing an institution

of this complex nature without endangering its cosmopolitan character.

On the other hand, many countries receive dii'ect or indirect advantages

from the existence of the Zoological Station at Naples, but do not accept

any or a due share of the burden of its maintenance.

Years ago I undertook to organise the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' on

the footing of international contributions, and failed to such an extent

that I had almost to give up the whole Jahresbericht. National prejudice
and private interest could not be moved to give way to higher aims. I

could easily furnish interesting mateiial in regard to the manner in which

these endeavours came to be frustrated, but I will rather defer it to another

occasion, since I am still resolved to try again, and perhaps on a greater

scale, the undertaking which failed fifteen years ago. Professor Foster's

·own speech and many other utterances of authoritative character prove

undoubtedly that what I attempted in 1879 will soon be generally taken

xip, and will doubtless prove one of the most important steps in the

organisation of science. Meanwhile I have been busy preparing for the

continuance of the station's monarchical constitution by winning over

the municipal authorities of Naples to revise the original contract, which
       --

       ox THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.     337

did not give me the right to establish the inheritance of the Zoological
Station on one of my four sons. The revision has now been carried

through, and my eldest son is directing his studies in order to be pre-

pared to continue the administration of the station when the time comes
that his father is unable to carry it on. The right of inheritance being

extended to all my four sons, T hope the future of the Zoological Station

will be considered somewhat better established now than it was some

years ago.

    I am further endeavouring to render the task easier for my sons by

collecting funds, which may serve as a reserve and pension fund for times
of depression, or when age and disease should deprive me and the station

of the valuable co-operation of any of my faithful staff, thus establishing

the station on the footing of an industrial or commercial enterprise, but
without the drawback of having to pay dividends to shareholders. The
progress made in this direction is naturally slow and only possible with

Germany's generosity ; but it is to be hoped that such funds once esta-

blished, and their existence made known, even private help may be obtained

for their more rapid increase.

     In giving you this information, dear Mr. Sladen, I hope rather to

augment than to diminish the readiness for help which, from the very

beginning, the Zoological Station has met with in Great Britain, and to

facilitate the maintenance of the table which the British Association has

--so many years kept up in an institution which has become Professor
--Foster's own words prove it a forerunner of many other institutions to

be ci'eated in the next century on an international basis for the promotion

--of research. Yours sincerely,

                                                                            Anton Dohrn.

     The progress of the various publications undertaken by the station is
summarised as follows :

     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfcs von Neapel,' the monographs
by Professor Spengel on ' Enteropneusta ' (758 pp., 37 plates), and by
Professor Delia Valle on ' Gammarini ' (948 pp., 61 plates) have been

published ; and the monograph by Dr. W. Miiller on ' Ostracoda ' is nearly

ready.

     2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'

is in the press.

     3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht,' the whole ' Bericht ' for 1892
has been published, and the ' Bericht ' for 1893 is nearly ready. There is
also in the press an Alphabetical Index for the years 1886 to 1890.

   A4. new edition (entirely rewritten) of the ' Guide to the Aquarium '

(in German) is being prepared.

I. On the ' Reduction Division ' in the Cartilaginous Fishes.
                           By J. E. S. Moore.

In availing myself of the unrivalled opportunities for investigation

offered by the marine laboratory at Naples, I had in view the continua-

tion of some researches, concerning the nature of the origin of the repro-
ductive elements in forms which it was difficult to obtain under suitable

conditions "while at home.

    No great amount of reliable descriptive matter relating to the origin

and anatomy of the reproductive cells is really available from a modern

cytological standpoint                                                                                                     but  notwithstanding this  paucity  of  material
                                                                                                                        ;

wherewith to build, the intellectual activity of tlie time has been able

to fit it to a vast superstructure of speculation which in the minds of not

a few observers of to-day has only been built to fall.

    AVherever theory far outstrips the facts, and by its own light pene-

trates where actual observation has not yet been made, its explanations

are always subject to a long and close revision, as the bricks of the
actually known mount up and their theoretical substitutes are individually
weighed and left to stand or thrown away as wanting.

     The demonstration of a number of nuclear chromosomes constant for

each species both for animals and plants was no sooner found to be a

uniA^ersal truth than the discovery of a reduction by one half of this
number in the origin of the two pronuclei, as described by Hertwig in

the case of Ascaris, led up to the belief that in this phenomenon lay the

secret of that blending of hereditary characters which naturalists had so

long sought in vain.

In the case of the invertebrates in which the reduction divisions were

first described, the chromosomes are said to pass undivided to the

daughter cells in such a way that there are only half as many in these

as in the parent, and the assumed universality of this phenomenon forms

the keynote of that part of Weismann's theory which deals with the
balancing of the hereditary stuffs at fertilisation. Some experience of
the phenomenon of maturation in the spermatogenesis of Mammalia had

convinced me that, although there was a numerical chromatic reduction,

this phenomenon was brought about in a manner quite different from

what was generally supposed ; and I determined during my stay in

Naples to study the same phenomena as pi-esented in Elasmobranchs,
so that we should be able to arrive at definite conclusions in another

great group of vertebrates.

    It had been my intention at the same time incidentally to make an

embryological study of the developmental liistology of the whole repro-

ductive gland, but the limited amount of material available for this

purpose necessitated the restriction of my work to somewhat narrower

lines.

   A preliminary account of this was published in the ' Anatomische

Anzeiger,' in a note ' On the Germinal Blastema and the Nature of the

so-called " Reduction Division " in the Cartilaginous Fishes,' which I had

completed on February 28. During March, April, and May I was able

to revise and extend the results I had hitherto obtained.

    It will be seen that my observations respecting the reduction phe-

nomena fit in admirably with the half theoretical »nticipations of Boveri,
ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  331)

as well as with what I had already found to be the case in the spermato-
genesis of Mammalia, and what Brauer regards as the more correct ren-
dering of the same phenomena in Ascaris.

      The last two divisions of the Elasmobranch spermatogenesis are quite
distinct from those which go before.

      TlT»re are twelve chromosomes in the penultimate division, whether

we count them when emerging as chromatic rings from the reticulum of

the previous resting nucleus in the ' monaster,' or as the divided loops

when nearing the opposite poles of the spindle figure as suggested by

Boveri.

     The daughter nuclei produced pass into a condition of complete
repose prior to tlie last division of the spermatogenetic series, and the
initial phases of the last mitosis, as well as its whole course, proceed in
exactly the same way as in the penultimate division, except that only six
chromosomes emerge from the resting reticulum instead of twelve.

   A close examination of these twelve chromosomes of the penultimate

division reveals the fact that they are each built up of four small conden-
sations or primary elements united together in the form of a ring, while

those constituting the individual loops or rings of the final division are

far more numerous. The small size and crowding of the parts in the
latter phase render counting very difficult, but numbers of readings

--satisfied me that in this division they are eight i.e., the twelve fourfold

chromosomes of the penultimate division are rearranged in the form of
six eight-fold chromosomes in the last division, while both divisions are
normal mitoses, in which there is no passage of unsplit chromatic masses

to the poles.
      In the spermatogenesis of this fish, then, there is reduction only in the

number of the chromosomes when they reappear from this rest in the final
as compared with the penultimate division. But this change is not
brought about by either division ; it occurs during the resting condition of
the nucleus between the two, and exists simply as a rearrangement of the

parts.

     From Brauer's work it seems that the so-called ' reduction ' in the

spermatogenesis of Ascaris is brought about during an intervening rest

between the last mitoses, just as in the case of the Mammalia, and we now

have it also in the cartilaginous fish, so that it follows that in these
widely separated groups the last two divisions of the spermatogenesis do
not correspond to the successive extrusions of the polar bodies, because
between the two mitoses which bring about this extrusion there is no rest
phase, and the supposed absence of this between the last divisions of the
spermatogenesis was the very fact from which Hertwig argued their

similarity.

     Moreover, Boveri seems conclusively to show that there is no ' reduc-
tion ' accomplished in any division up to the formation of the first ovicyte,
nor yet in either division by which the polar bodies themselves are formed.

Yet there are only half as many chromosomes in the divisions which form

the polar bodies as there are in the mitoses prior to the formation of the

first ovicyte, and so ab infra the reduction must occur in the rest after the
division which forms the cell.

     If a comparison can be made at all, the spermatogenesis of the forms

under discussion stops short at a point corresponding to the formation of

the first ovicyte in the ovigenesis.

      Such, then, are the bare facts of the chromatic reductions in these carti-

laginous fishes. But it must not be supposed that they are more than the

"rossest features presented by a mass of material which will take many

months in fully working up.
     Nor yet are they in a strictly anatomical sense by any means the most

interesting features in relation to these cells ; the large clear elements of

the Elasmobranch testes present a splendid field for more purely cyto
lo"ical research, and I gave the briefest account of the direction in which
such investigations seemed tending in the article above referred to. Very
little is really known respecting cellular metamorphosis, or the morpholo-
gical value of the intercellular structures relating to it ; in fact, we are only
just beginning to extend morphological conceptions to cellular anatomy at
all. Consequently it is with the profoundest interest that I find among
other things the archoplasmic vesicle of the Elasmobranch spermatid to
have an intra nuclear origin, although it remains identical in structure
and minute relationship with that of the Mammalia, a pui'ely cytoplasmic

construction.

    In conclusion, I would express my thanks to the British Association
for the opportunity of completing my work, and to the Directors of the
Naples Laboratory for their unremitting kindness during my stay.

--The. Zoology of the Sandwich Islands. Fourth Report of the

    Committee, consisting of Professor A. Newton ( Chairman), Dr.
    W. T. Blanford, Dr.' S. J. Hickson, Professor C. V. Riley, Mr.
     (). Salvin, Dr. P. L. Sclater, Mr. E. A. Smith, and Mr. D.

     Sharp (Secretary).

The Committee were reappointed to continue their report on the

present state of our knowledge of the zoology of the Sandwich Islands
and to take steps to investigate ascertained deficiencies in the fauna,
with power to co-operate with the committee appointed for the purpose

by the Royal Society, and to avail themselves of such assistance as may

be ofi'ered by the Hawaiian Government.
     During the past year your Committee have been harmoniously co-

operating with that appointed by the Royal Society, and Mr. Perkins's
labours in the islands have been satisfactorily continued. Since your Com-

mittee last reported Mr. Perkins has been diligently exploring in succession
Molokai, Lanai, and Maui, from the first two of which very considerable
collections in almost all branches of the terrestrial fauna have already

been received, while one is shortly expected from the third. By the last

accounts he was about to proceed to Kauai.
      Although far from having completed the zoological exploration of the

archipelago, the Committee have thought it best that Mr. Perkins should
return home in the course of the autumn, and have instructed him accord-
ingly. They hope to obtain his assistance, in conjunction with that of
 other competent zoologists, towards working out his extensive collections,
 the value of which it is difficult to over-estimate, since evidence of the
 growing scarcity of many, and of the extinction of not a few members of
 the endemic fauna becomes stronger the more the subject is investigated.

      In view of making arrangements necessary for this purpose your Com-
 mittee request that they may be reappointed, with the same powers as before,
 but they do not ask on the present occasion for any grant of money.

     A. C. L. G. Gunther, Dr. D. Sharp, Mr. F. DuCane Godman,

     and Professor A. Newton.

This Committee was appointed in 1887, and it has been reappointed eacli

year until the present time.

     The Committee have to report satisfactory progress in obtaining
reports on the collections made by the Committee's collectors, and this
task of working out the results has engaged their exclusive attention during
the year. The following reports have been published (or are complete and
ready for publication) since the last annual report :

     1. Report on the parasitic Hymenoptera of St. Vincent by Messrs.
Riley, Ashmead, and Howard (Linnean Society). The corresponding
group from Grenada has been sent to these authors.

     2. Report on the Hemiptera of St. Vincent by Dr. Uhler (Zoological

Society).

     3. Report on the Ants of St. Vincent by Professor Forel (Entomo-

logical Society).

     4. Part III. dealing with the Diplopoda and Protoacheata of Mr.
Pocock's report (Linnean Society), with a supplement on the Pedipalpi,

Matthews (Annals and Magazine of Natural History).

     6. Report on the Attidaj of St. Vincent by Mr. Peckham (Zoological

     7. Report on the Diptera of St. Vincent by Professors Williston and
Aldrich (Linnean Society).

     8. Report on the Hepaticse of St. Vincent and Dominica by Richard
Spruce (Linnean Society).

      9. Report on the Freshwater Algse (including those of the boiling lake

of Dominica) by Mr. William West (Linnean Society).
     10. Report on the Spiders of St. Vincent, Part II., by M. Simon

(Zoological Society).

     The report on the Musci has been completed by Mr. Gepp, and will
be presented to the Linnean Society. The Marine Algfe have been
named by Mr. George Murray, who does not consider the result worth
separate publicatioii, and the Lichenes (the only remaining group of
plants) are in the hands of Professor Wainio for determination. The
large collection of Coleoptera from St. Vincent and Grenada, numbering
27,980 specimens, has been arranged by Messrs. Sharp and Gahan, and its
treatment will receive the Committee's immediate attention.

     The Committee recommend their reappointment, with the following

--members : Dr. Sclater (Chairman), Mr. George Murray (Secretary), Mr.

Carruthers, Professor Newton, Mr. Godman, Dr. Giinther, and Dr. Sharp.
They also recommend that a grant of 2001. be placed at their disposal to
enable them to continue their work and to adequately provide for the

exploration of Margarita.

On, the Later Stages in the Developvient of Becapod Crustacea. By Edgar J. Allen.

The Committee were appointed for the purpose of enabling Dr. S. J.

Hickson to investigate the development of Alcyonium at the Laboratory
of the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth.

     The Committee have received the following report from Dr. Hickson, and
a supplementary report from Mr. Edgar J. Allen, who occupied the table
during June and July 1893 :

On the Development of Alcyonuim. By Dr. S. J. Hickson, M.A.

On my arrival at Plymouth early in the month of December last I

experienced a great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient quantity of material,

in consequence of the severe storms then raging. The few specimens of

Alcyonium I obtained contained large quantities of ripe ova or sacs con-

taining ripe spermatozoa. They spawned freely in the tanks of the

aquarium, but I was not successful in fertilising the ova artificially, as the

water of the tanks affected injuriously the spermatozoa. I succeeded,

however, in obtaining a few young embryos by keeping the specimens iu

fresh sea-water in buckets. Soon after Christmas the sea became calmer

and I obtained plenty of colonies, but they were nearly all spent and

myuseless for  investigations.

The results I have obtained confirm those of Kowalewsky. I can find

no trace of any karyokinetic division of the first segmentation nucleus,

although these figures can be easily demonstrated in the later stages.

While I was waiting for sufficient material to study the embryology of

Alcyonium, I devoted a considerable amount of time to a study of the

Aminute anatomy and physiology of the genus.                                                                                             full account of these

investigations will appear in a paper now nearly ready for publication.

Researches on the Later Stages in the Develoj)ment of Decapod Crustacea.

                         By Edgar J. Allen, B.Sc. London.

My attention during the months, June and July 1893, when I occu-

pied the Association table, was devoted chiefly to the study of the

nervous system. After repeated trials on a number of decapod embryos

and larvas, a satisfactory subject for research was found in the embryonic

lobster, many of the nerve elements of which stain excellently in dilute

Mysolutions of methylene blue.                                                                                   observations, after being coiitinued and

extended, were published in a preliminary paper read before the Royal

Society in April 1894, whilst a fully illustrated account will shortly

appear in the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science.'

The following nerve-elements are amongst the most important of

those which I was able to demonstrate during the time which I occupied

the Association table :

     (1) Elements starting from a cell in one ganglion of the thorax and
giving off a fibre, which, after sending numerous arborescent branches to
346 REPORT-- 1894.

the neuropile of that ganglion, ends in a small tuft of fine branches in the
next ganglion behind.

     (2) Elements starting from a cell in one ganglion of the thorax,
giving off a fibre which sends out lateral arborescent branches in the
ganglion, passes forwards to the next ganglion, where it gives off a small
tuft of branches, and finally ends in a tuft of branches in the ganglion
next but one in fi'ont of that in which the cell lay.

     The terminal tuft of each element lies close to the lateral tuft of the
corresponding element of the next ganglion, and opposite the terminal
tuft of the elements of Group 1.

     (3) Elements starting from a cell in a ganglion giving off a fibre,
which passes through one of the lateral nerves and finally breaks up upon

a muscle.

The Influence of Previous Fertilisation of the Female on her S'uhsequent

   --Offsjyring, and the Effect of Alateruul Impressions during Pregnancy

      on tJie Offspring. Interim Eeport of the Committee, consisting of

     Dr. A. RusSEL Wallace (Ghairman), Dr. James Clark (Secre-

     tary), Dr. G. J. Romanes, Professor S. J. Hickson, Professor E. A.
     Schafer, and. Dr. J. N. Langley. (Brawn up hy the Secretary).

The members of this Committee wish to exjjress their deep sense of the

irreparable loss they have sustained in the death of Dr. Romanes, whose
previous experience in this difficult field of inquiry rendered liis judg-
ment and advice invaluable.

     During the jjast year the efibrts of the Committee have been mainly
directed to collecting facts and statistics relating to Telegony. In this
they have received considerable assistance from the principal agricultural
clubs in the country, and have been offered assistance by several societies
in France, Switzerland, Germany, and America. Twenty-five preliminary
reports have also been received from veterinary surgeons in Scotland and
the North of England. In all over 900 letters and reports have been
received. The majority, however, are too vague to be of any Service, and

many correspondents send generalisations ' based on personal observation

and experience,' instead of recording facts. In the description of actual

cases, too, the data supplied are generally too meagre. On account of the

difficulty of obtaining reliable and sufficient data, the Committee consider

it advisable to defer the publication of the collected facts until the im-
portant points connected with each can be verified or corroborated.

    An examination of the pedigree cattle and of the stud-books and prize-

bred horses of Yorkshire is also in progress, and will, it is hoped, be
completed in the course of a few mf)nths.

     The belief in Telegony among breeders and fanciers is very widely
spread. The general consensus of opinion among our correspondents is
that it frequently occurs in cats, occasionally in dogs and horses, rarely in
birds, and almost never in cattle and sheep. The majority of the writers
further insist that it is the first fertilisation only that has any effect
upon subsequent offspring by a diffei-ent male.

     On account of the amount of work that still remains to be done, the
Committee respectfully request that they may be re-appointed for another

year.

The proposed 'Index Generum et Specierum Animalium' is being
compiled by Mr. C. Davies Sherborn, at the British Museum (Natural

History).

     The work on this index, which includes all animals, whether recent or
fossil, has proceeded steadily since June 1890.

    The manuscript now consists of 180,000 slips, representing 90,000

species and genera recorded in duplicate.
     One set is sorted under genera for the convenience of students and the

other set is kept under ' books,' so that it is possible at any moment to
obtain a complete list of every genus and species described in a particular

volume.

    As the work proceeds much valuable information as to the dates of

])ooks is obtained, and this if sufficiently important is published : e.g.y
Sowerby, ' Genera of Shells,' see ' Annals and Mag.,' April 1894 ; Schreber,
' Saugthiere,' see ' Proc. Zool. Soc.,' Jan. 1892; 'Encyclop. Methodique,'
see 'Proc. Zool. Soc.,' June 1893.

     The small grant of 201. made by the British Association in 1892 is
the only financial help yet received towards the work, and has been ex-
pended upon paper. The Committee therefore ask for a new grant of 50/.
toward a work which daily increases in importance and usefulness.

--TJte Legislative Protection of Wild Birds' E(j<js. Report of the Com-

     onittee, consisting of Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S. (Chairman),
     Professor Alfred Newton, F.R.8., Eev. Canon Tristram, F.R.S.

    Mr. John Cordeaux, Mr. W. H. Hudson, Mr. Howard

     Saunders, Mr. Thomas H. ThOxMas, Dr. C. T. Vachell, and Mr.
     H. E. Dresser (Secretary). (Brawn np hy the Secretary).

Your Committee beg leave to report that in the early portion of the pre-
sent Parliamentary Session a fresh Bill to amend the Wild Birds Protec-
tion Act, 1880, was brought into the House of Commons by Sir Herbert

Maxwell, Bart., M.P., and others, which Bill was on April 3 ordered by
the House to be printed.

     Your Committee had already been in communication with Sir Herbert
Maxwell on the subject, and it was arranged to hold a meeting to discuss
the clauses of this Bill, and a meeting was accordingly held on April 6,
at which Sir Herbert Maxwell attended. The present Bill diiSfers from
that brought in by Sir Herbert Maxwell last Session (1893), in prohibiting
the taking of the eggs of any specified kind within the limits of the
country, or part or parts thereof, or else the taking of the eggs of any

species within a certain stated area ; it being left in the hands of the
County Council to adopt either alternative. After some discussion it was
decided by your Committee to approve the draft Bill as prepared by Sir
Herbert Maxwell. This Bill has since passed through both Houses with

but slight opposition, and has now come into force.

--Mir/ratioH of Birds. Interim Report of a Committee, considing of

     Professor A. Newton (Chairman), Mr. John Cordeaux (Secretary),
    Messrs. R. M. Barrington, J. A. Harvie-Brown, W. Eagle

     Clarke, and the Rev. E. P. Knubley, appointed for the p)vrpose

      of malcing a Digest of the Oliservations on the Migration of Birds
     at Lighthouses and Light-vessels.

The Committee have to report that the systematic tabulation of the various

items in the schedules has at length been completed by one of their

-- --number Mr. W. Eagle Clarke and that they are now prepared to

approach the subject of the final report, which it is hoped will be ready
for presentation at the meeting of the Association in 189.5 or, at t'he latest,
at the meeting in 1896.

     The Committee trust that the Association will reappoint them as

before.

--Tlbe Climatological and Hydrographical Conditions of Tropical Africa.

     Third Report of a Committee consisting of Mr. E. G. Ravenstein
     (Chairman), Mr. Baldwin Latham, Mr. G. J. Symons, and Dr.
     H. R. Mill (Secretary). (Drawn ^ip hy Mr. E. G. Ravenstein.)

Your Committee, up to the end of July last, had issued five sets of

meteorological instruments at a cost, including forms, carriage, itc, exceed-

ing 100/. The first of these sets was entrusted to Mr. J. W. Moir (British

Central Africa), the second to Mr. Buchanan (British Central Africa),

the third to Captain Gallwey (Warri, Benin), the fourth to the Rev. C.

Eonzon (Lambai-ene on the Ogowe), and the fifth to the Rev. R. Clennie

A{Bolobo, Congo).  si.xth set is kept in reserve for British East Africa.

Two of these sets, namely, those in the hands of Mr. Buchanan and

Mr. Glennie, include Fortin barometers, whilst that granted to Captain

Gallwey includes a black bulb thermometer.

Observations up to the latest possible date have been received from

Mr. Glennie, Mr. Bonzon, and Dr. Roth as representing Captain Gallwey.

     Instructions have been issued to the officials of the Royal Niger

Company to make their observations iza future in accordance with the
rules laid down by your Committee, and the like step is contemplated by

"tlie British East Africa Company.

     Summaries of meteorological returns are appended to this report.
Your Committee are quite aware that these observations are not in every

instance as complete and trustwortliy as could be desired. In some cases

the hours of observation are ill chosen (a very common occurrence), in

others the instruments are defective or the corrections to be applied to the

readings are unknown. If they are published notwithstanding, it is done

because they refer to localities concerning which nothing or very little is

known at the present time.

Quite a number of meteorological records offered to the Committee for

publication have had to be rejected as being on the face of them utterly

untrustworthy. It seems a pity that -so much time and labour should

have been wasted upon recording observations which with a little fore-

tliought and caution might have furnished important information on the

climate of Tropical Africa.

The grant of 5/. made to the Committee last year was not claimed.

REPORT 1894.

--The Exploration of Hadramout in Southern Arabia. Beport of the

     Committee, consisting of Mr. H. Seebohm (Ghairma.n), Mr. J.
     Theodore Bent (Secretary), Mr. E. G. Ravenstein, Dr. J. G.

    Garson, and Mr. G. W. Bloxam. (Braini up by Mr. Bent.)

Our expedition left Aden on December 15, 1893, for Mokulla, the sea-
port from which we were to start inland for the Hadramout valley. The

coast-line of this part of Arabia is peculiarly harbourless, and the only
ports for the Hadramout valley are Mokulla and Sheher, the former being-
only available during the north-east monsoons, a,nd the latter being merely
an open roadstead. Sheher was until late years the most flourishing of
the two places, but the transfer of the suzei'ainty over these places to the
Al Kaiti family has resulted in Mokulla becoming by far the most thriving
of the two, and Sheher is gradually falling into ruins.

      Before describing the interior it will be well to explain the conditions.

of political affairs in the Hadramout and the origin of the Al Kaiti family
which rules there. At present this is the most powerful family in the dis-
trict, and is reputed to be the richest in Arabia.

     About five generations ago the Sayyids of the Aboubekir family, at
that time the chief Arab family in the Hadramout, who claimed descent
from the first of tlie Caliphs, were at variance with the Bedouin tribes,
and in their extremity they invited assistance from the chiefs of the Yafi
tribe, who inhabit the Yafi district, to the north-east of Aden. To this
request the Al Kaiti family responded by sending assistance to the Say-
yids of the Hadramout, and putting down the troublesome Bedouin tribes,
and establishing a fair amount of peace and prospei'ity in the country,
though even to this day the Bedouins of the mountains are ever ready to

swoop down and hai-ass the more peaceful inhabitants of the towns. At

the same time the Al Kaiti family established themselves in the Hadra-
mout, and for the last four generations have been steadily adding to the
power thus acquired. Mokulla, Sheher, Shibam, Haura, Hagarein, all
belong to them, and they are continually increasing by purchase the area

of their influence in the collateral valleys, building substantial palaces,

and establishing one of the most powerful dynasties in this much divided
country. They get all their money from India and the Straits Settlements, for
it has been the custom of the Hadrami to leave their own somewhat sterile
country to seek their fortunes abroad. The Nizam of Hyderabad has an
Arab regiment composed entirely of Hadrami, and the Sultan Nawasjung,
the present head of the Al Kaiti family, is its general : he lives in India,
and governs his Arabian possessions by deputy. His son Ghalib rules in
Sheher, his nephew Manassah rules in Mokulla, and his nephew Salah
rules in Shibam, and the governors of the other towns are mostly connec-
tions of this family. The power and wealth of this family are almost the
only guarantee for peace and prosperity in an otherwise lawless country.

      The configuration of the country is interesting and very peculiar ; the
coast-line all the way from Mokulla to Saihut is hopelessly arid and un-
productive, except where hot springs come out of the ground. That at
 Ghail ba Wazir, about twelve miles from Sheher, is utilised for the culti-

vation of tobacco, palms, and fodder ; that at Al Hami is exceedingly hot,
so hot that when it rises the hand can hardly bear it ; that at Dis also

 fertilises a considerable area, and there are several others. Beyond these

 natural streams, or ghails as they are called, the coast-line is both water-

 less and featureless, and it is very narrow : in most parts the line of moun-
 tains begins to rise about six miles from the coast, and continues an
 abrupt and almost unbi'oken line all along the coast. Several caravan
 roads penetrate into the interior up the short valleys, but in every case tlieie
 is a very steep ascent, exceedingly arduous for camels and beasts of burden.

At an elevation of 5,000 feet there is a plateau extending on all sides, as

 far as the eye can reach, divided by nature into two storeys, the upper one
 being about eighty feet higher than the lower, and representing what is

left of a higher surface gradually disappearing in the course of ages. On
the upper storey vegetation is entirely absent, and in many places the

 ground is covered with black basaltic stones scattered over the sui'face as
 if from a gigantic pepper-pot. In the gullies of this upper storey there
 are considerable traces of vegetation, and it is here that the myrrh trees
and frankincense trees grew which once formed the wealth of this district.
 The subject of frankincense and myrrh is of course one of the most interesting
in connection with the Hadramout, as this portion of Arabia was the one

which supplied the ancient world with these precious drugs and when one
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

considers how they were anciently used, both for private and religious

purposes, one can readily understand the commercial importance of these
commodities. Claudius Ptolemy gives us accurate information as to the
caravan routes by which the drugs were conveyed to the Mediterranean
from the country of the Hadramitas, or Chatramitre as the Greeks, from their
inability to sound the initial H, called it. Pliny also affords us valuable
information on the subject, as do also the Arabian geographers of the

earlier centuries of our era. From personal observation I should say that
the ancients held communication with the Hadramout almost entirely by
the land caravan route, as there are absolutely no traces of antiquity to be
found along the arid coast-line, whereas the interior valley and its collateral

branches are very rich in remains of the ancient Himyaritic civilisation.
Evidently the trees which produced these drugs grew on the plateau.

Myn-h trees are still very common on it, and every year Africans come

over from Somaliland for the purpose of collecting the sap. During our
wanderings we only once came across a specimen of the frankincense tree :
it has evidently almost entirely disappeared from this locality, but is to be

still found in abundance, I am told, further east, in the country of the

Mahri tribe.

      It is highly probable that the systematic destruction of the timber on

this plateau during the course of countless ages has much to say to the
present deplorable condition of the Hadramout and its collateral valleys.
These are all being silted up by sand, which invades them from the

central desert on the north and from the plateau on the south. This

sand in many instances is forty feet deep, and entirely covers the running
waters which for the purposes of cultivation have to be brought up by

wells and led to the land intended for cultivation by an elaborate system
of irrigation. There are very few running streams in this district, and

every year we were told they are becoming fewer, and will undoubtedly
very soon disappear altogether. The inhabitants of the Hadramout

have a hard struggle to maintain against this invasion of their country
by a natural catastrophe, and were it not for the custom of the in-
habitants of going abroad to seek their fortunes, there is no doubt that
long ago the country would have been abandoned, and the struggle for

                                                                                        A a2

existence given up. The strong fanaticism of the inhabitants and their

belief in the sacredness of their country have been another very im-

portant factor in perpetuating its existence. Every man who leaves the

Hadramout in search of fortune hopes to return and die in the odour of

sanctity. No woman ever leaves the country, and there are cases on

record of a wife being separated from her husband for forty years.

On their return the wanderers relapse into the same condition of

fanaticism and hatred of all external influence which has obtained in

this country from time immemorial, and all they have gained is money

Avith which to continue to live in their own valley, and erect the castles

and palaces with which the whole line of the Hadramout is thickly

studded.

    The plateau when reached extends, as I have said, to an apparently

unlimited extent in every direction ; after one day's journey, however,

it will be seen that valleys running northwards are cut out of this flat

surface like slices out of a cake. The principal valleys which run into

the big central valley from the south are the Wadi Al Isa, Al Eyn,
Dowan, Racliy, Adym, and Ben Ali ; there are many others which we had

not the time or opportunity to visit. The chief peculiarity of these

valleys is that tliey descend very rapidly, and are at their head very

nearly as deep as during the rest of their course. They seem as if they

had formed part of a great inland fiord, from which the sea retired at

.some remote period, leaving the successive marks of many strands on the

sandstone and limestone walls which shut in these valleys. Everywhere

the descent into them is rapid and diflicult, and no place I have ever

seen in the world can possibly be more shut oft' and hennned in by

natural features as the broad main valley known as the Hadramout and

its collateral branches. The old Arabian stoiy of Sinbad descending

into a deep valley on the back of a roc must have originated in some

such country as this. It is remarkable how the camels contrive to get

to and fro, and frequent accidents to the animals take place during the

ascent and descent from the plateau. As seen from above, the aspect of

these long narrow valleys is exceedingly curious ; the walls of rocks are

almost precipitous, about 1,000 feet in height. In many places the

valleys are not a mile wide, and present one long unbroken line of

villages, each with its palm grove, its cultivated land, its big castles
and houses, and its surrounding hovels for the lower classes. Even the

Bedouins have big houses here and settled abodes when on a journey

or  pasturing  their flocks                                            they have no tents, and are  little  better  than
                                                                    ;

naked savages. But when they ret.urn home to their valley we find

them living in large commodious houses sevei'al storeys in height, with

the antlers of antelopes decorating them outside, and though only built

of sun-dried bricks their architecture reminds one of the media3val

towns on the Rhine. In fact, if one could substitute a flat surface of
sand covei-ing the river bed and place almost treeless mountains on either

side one might well compare these valleys to those of Germany. The

town^ of Hagarein is built on an isolated hill in the middle of the

Wadi Kasr, with its walls and battlements, its turrets and machi-

colations : it looks at a distance exactly like one of the fortified mediteval
towns of Europe.

    In most cases the narrower valleys are the most fertile, the water

supply is far better than it is in the main valley, for at the head of the
main valley are the salt hills of the Shabwa district, from which, as in
ON THE EXPLORATION OF HADRAMOUT IN SOUTHERN ARABIA. 357

the days of Makrisi, the Bedouins bring caravans of salt : this impreg-
nates the water of the main valley with strong alkaline deposits, and tlie

water from the wells, especially in the centre of the valley, is very dis-
agreeable. This, however, is not the case in the narrower valleys, and

from the Wadi Adym, the Wadi Al Eyn and Dowan, come the best

dates and the best honey, which form two of the principal productions of

the country.

  --In many places the main valley of the Hadramout is very wide even

near Shibam it is three miles wide, and where it is entered by the collateral

Webranches considerably more.     were only able to trace its course as

far as Terim, but beyond that, as it slopes towards the sea of Saihut, I
have reason to believe it assumes magnificent proportions, but owing to
the hostility of the tribes in that direction we were unable to proceed, as

we had wished, along the whole length of it ; and even the Arabs, under
the rule of the Al Kaiti family, are themselves ignorant of this route,
always going down to the sea by the plateau roads, as the long valley

road is unsafe for caravans.

     Our investigations were principally confined to the main valley and

its arteries. The Sultan of Shibam hospitably entertained us in his
palace at Al Katan for three weeks, from which point we were able to

visit a large number of the places of interest in the vicinity. At El Meshed
we \'isited the ruins of a very large town at the mouth of the Wadi
Dowan, and brought home several inscriptions therefrom. Also at two

or three other spots near Shibam  we got inscriptions    but  the  expedition

                                                       ;

which most repaid us was that up the Wadi Ser to the north of the main

valley, by which we wei'e able to determine the position of the great

central desert at this point, and also, from inscriptions, one of the old
caravan roads which led northwards from the frankincense country. In

this valley too we visited the Kabr Salah, one of the tombs held sacred

by the Bedouins, and particularly watched over by them as distinct from

the Arab shrines : it is a long tomb forty feet in length, and is one of many

tombs popularly supposed by the Bedouins to belong to a race of giants

which are to be found at several points in the Hadramout. There is no
question about it that the Bedouins represent an older civilisation and
practise an older cult than the Arabs in this district. The Sayyids and
Sherifs of the Arab population look down on the Bedou, referring to them

as heathen who only outwardly conform to the laws of Mohammedanism

when absolutely compelled.
     The inscriptions and archreological results of our Hadramout expedition

are now in the hands of the great Himyaritic scholar. Dr. D. H. Miiller,

of Vienna, and I have confident hopes that he will be able to produce for

us some interesting results.

    The map of our expedition and a survey of the country which we
traversed have been made by Imam Shei-if, Khan Bahadar, who was sent

out by the Indian Government. It is particularly valuable as being the

first attempt at surveying anything beyond the coast-line in this part of

Arabia, and I have hopes that he will accompany us again next year to

continue this work.

    Thei'e is a remarkable absence of mammalia in the Hadramout ; we
only saw a few gazelle and heard of the ibex as dwelling in the moun-

tains near Siwun. The fact that we constantly saw the rotting carcasses

of sheep proves the total absence of carnivorous beasts and birds, which is

doubtless due to the lack of running water. There are also very few birds
358 REPORT--1894.

of any sort in the valley, though in the cultivation near Al Katan we saw

quantities of swallows, evidently hibei-nating there. The naturalist sent

out by Dr. Anderson, however, made an excellent collection of snakes,

lizards, and other reptiles which abound in the rocky mountains. These

are at present being arranged by Dr. Anderson, and a complete set will

be presented to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.

Owing to the fanaticism of the natives we were unfortunately unable

to take any anthropometric observations; in fact, it would have been

extremely dangerous to do so in the interior. I have hopes, however,

another season to be able to do this at some of the coast towns, where the

Bedouins from the interior go down in considerable numbers. They are

very interesting as types of an early race, being very different from the

Bedouins of Northern Arabia. They are short, thin, and wiry, with

handsome, refined faces, aquiline noses, and thin lips, almost as dark as

negroes in their skin, and with long black hair, which they tie up in a

knot at the back of their heads. During our long stay at Al Katan we

were able to collect many interesting points with regard to their manners

and customs, but the same difficulty that prevented us from taking

measurements also confronted us in trying to take photographs of this

interesting type of humanity. They have a fixed objection to sitting for

their portraits, and the few we took at haphazard do not give a very

satisfactory idea of the type.

Mrs. Bent was, however, able to take an interesting series of views of

the Hadramout valley, the palaces and buildings, &c., which give a good

idea of the country.

    The botanist (W. Lunt) who was sent out by the authorities of Kew

made a collection of the flora of this district, which is rather meagre, but

very interesting, as being the first collection brought from Arabia east of

Aden. In it there are four new genera and thirty new species, which is

remai-kable, considering that the collection did not contain much over 200

varieties                              and  it  has  also  established  the  fact  that  the  flora  of  Arabia
                                    ;

corresponds most closely to that of Abyssinia.

   We purpose to return to Arabia during the coming winter, and, if

possible, to enter at Muscat and make our way thence to the Hadramout,

which will give us an opportunity of surveying the whole inhabitable line

Weof country along the coast of South-eastern Arabia.                                         therefore hope

for the reappointment of the Committee, with a grant of money.

gian whalers and sealers making experimental voyages in these waters
that they could return for him after a year. In the circumstances the

and the sum of 50^. drawn by the Committee and held in readiness to add

bility of memorialising Government on the great scientific advances

ing and sealing vessels in the discovery of new lands of great interest is

by protected steamers.

--Appendix. Addition to Alternative Courses in Elemeyitary Science  imrje 3C4

Last year your Committee were able to report a rapid advance in the
adoption of elementary science as a class subject in the day schools, and

the great provision made for it in the New Code for evening continuation

schools. This year they have only to report progress in the same direction.

     The number of departments of schools in which the following class
subjects were examined by Her Majesty's Inspector during the eight years

1882 to 1890, when English was obligatory, were as follows :

during the eight years 1882-90 has been as folloM^s :

passes in any science subject at the Science and Art Department examina-

 tion, or for the holding of University Extension certificates in science.
      For several years past the Insti-uctions to Inspectors have contained a

clause stating that, among the things provided by a good school, may be

 ' an orderly collection of simple objects, geological and botanical specimens,
examples of industrial processes or other apparatus, chiefly designed to
illustrate the school lessons, and formed in part by the co-operation of the
scholars themselves.' This year the Department have taken the further

.step of stipulating that a' classified list of the objects and other articles of

interest in the school museum should also be kept.' This will render the
school museums more valuable instruments of education, and prevent
them from degenei'ating into a mei'e miscellaneous assemblage of objects.

      In regard to evening continuation schools, there is no alteration in the

Code that calls for remark. But in the Revised Instructions to Her

Majesty's Inspectors my Lords say : ' The subjects taught in the day school

should be such as to form a solid foundation on which the higher studies of

the evening may be built. The knowledge of the scientific principles which
underlie the technique of the industries of the neighbourhood ... is
among the most important of such subjects. It might help to secure the

continuity of school life if the day scholars were allowed occasionally to
attend some of the more attractive evening lessons, such as travels illus-
trated by the optic lantern, or a science lecture illustrated by experiments.'

Optic lanterns are now of so excellent a character that they can be used
for illustrating lessons in the daytime without darkening the room. The
London School Board has recently purchased a dozen with that view.

      For the last four years there has been a clause in the Code stating
that, ' in making up the minimum time constituting an attendance, there

may be reckoned time occupied by instruction in science (amongst others),

whether or not it is given in the school premises or by the ordinary
teachers of the school, provided that special and appropriate provision,
approved by the Inspector, is made for such instruction, and the times for
giving it are entered in the approved time-table.' The London School
Board have made several attempts to get leave from the Education

Department to allow of occasional visits to such places as Kew Gardens,

South Kensington Museum, &c., to be so counted. But although 'the
Science and Art Department recognise attendance at such places, pro-

vided that the attendance is for not less than for one hour, that the visit

is made for the purpose of the scholars receiving instruction, and that the
scholars are instructed during the visit by the teacher of the class,' the
Education Department still require the literal fulfilment of the above-
mentioned clause, which is framed to meet the conditions of centre
teaching, and not of visits to other institutions of an educational character.

A recent deputation from the Manchester Art Museum on the subject of

bringing picture galleries, public museums, &c., into requisition in teaching
art and science was, however, very favourably received by Mr. Acland,
and he promised increased facilities for this purpose in next year's Code.
Your Committee trust, therefore, that, not only will the London School
Board be allowed to make the use they propose of such institutions, but that

the provision may be made general, so as to apply to all the schools in the

provinces wherever the means exist of obtaining such practical instruction.

    On January 6 last the Education Department issued a valuable

circular (No. 332) on the subject of instruction in the lower standards.
The general scope of the circular is to promote in the schools for older
         ox THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 363

scholars the natural methods of instruction adopted in the best infants'
schools, by which the children are trained to use their powers of observa-

tion and reasoning. With reference to the matters in which your Com-
mittee are more immediately concerned, it states : ' It sliould be borne in
mind that object-lessons cannot be dispensed with if habits of observation
are to be duly fostered, and they should be treated as a means for mental
exercise, and not merely as opportunities for imparting miscellaneous
information. Objects should always be present and in sufficient numbers,
and the chief aim should be to call into activity observation and the con-

struction of clear mental pictures, so that the intelligence of the pupils

may be exercised and developed. Geography, where it is a class subject,

should be treated in a similar way, and should be taught by visible illus-
trations and by actual modelling in sand and clay, for the production of

miniature rivers, mountains, &c.'

     Reference has been made in previous reports to the important work
being done by the science demonstrators under the London School Board

--in introducing practical lessons into the schools lessons in the course of

which the children are not merely orally instructed, but are led to carry

out themselves a series of simple measurements and to make experiments

with the object of solving easy little problems, being thus taught both to
be accurate and to be self-reliant. The vacancy in the staff caused by

the appointment of Mr. Gordon, who has been so eminently successful in
this work, as one of the Inspectors under the Science and Art Depart-
ment has been filled by the appointment of Mr. Heller, an Associate of
the City and Guilds of London Institute for the Advancement of

Technical Education. He will carry on the instruction under the scheme

given in the Appendix, which is no ideal scheme, but an outline of the
work actually done in a considerable number of London schools during

the past three years. No other School Board appears as yet to have

attempted to give systematic practical instruction on such lines with the

object of training children to gain their knowledge by their own efforts,
thereby training them to help themselves and to think logically ; but the
work of the London Board has been carried on with such satisfactory
results, and the method adopted is of such promise, that it is to be hoped
that the example of this Board will be generally followed. The immediate
difficulty that will be met with in this direction, however, arises from the
lack of suitable teachers, and it cannot be too strongly urged that no time
should be lost in organising classes for teachers and placing them under
competent instructors. As County Councils have in some places already
shown willingness to assist in this direction, it is to be hoped that progress
will not be prevented by want of funds, and that School Boards and

County Councils will effectively co-operate in this great work, the national

importance of which must ere long be recognised.
     Practical lessons similar in character to those which have been given

in some of the boys' schools are about to be added to those now given in
some of the girls' schools under the London Board. The results of this

experiment will be awaited with the greatest interest, although there can

scarcely be a doubt as to their proving to be equally satisfactory. When

the character of the household work done by women is taken into account,

it is obvious that training can be imparted at school in the course of such

experimental lessons as are to be given to the girls which will be of direct

practical value, and the most effective preparation possible for much of

women's work. If girls can be taught to weigh and measure accurately,
364 REPOltT-- lS9i.

and to understand the use of a thermometer, and if they acquire but the
most elementary understanding of the nature of food and of the opera-
tions incidental to cooking by actually experimenting while at school, the
foundation of habits will have been laid and knowledge will have been
gained which will make them far more careful, competent, skilful, and
trustworthy when, later on, they become cooks or nurses or wives or
mothers. It is not too much to hope that a really satisfactory method of

teaching domestic economy and housewifery may ultimately be devised on

the basis of experience gained in the course of lessons such as are here
referred to.

     Your Committee observe with satisfaction that the Royal Commission
on Secondary Education comprises direct representatives of the Board
School system, and some who have interested themselves mucli in technical
instruction. In the present reorganisation of our scholarship arrange-
ments it is to be hoped that the proper co-ordination of the studies in

Natural Science will be duly cared for.

HI. On the Condition of Economic Studies in the United Kingdom. By

          E. C. K. Gonner

In furtherance of the above purpose three reports have been drawn up

after due inquiry and laid before your Committee.
     These reports, wliich are appended, bring out very clearly some features

of difference between the position of such studies in this and in foreign coun-
tries, and, with other information before your Committee, seem to them to

call for the following observations. Before proceeding to the consideration of
certain particular points they would remark that the growth of economic

studies, and in particular the development among them of the scientific
study of the actual phenomena of life (both in the past and in the present),
have important effects, so far as the organisation of the study and its suit-
ability for professional curricula are concerned. It may be hoped, indeed,

that when the empirical side is more adequately represented, the import-

ance of the careful study of Economics as a preparation for administrative
life will be more fully recognised both by Government and the public.

   --(a) The Organisation of the Study of Economics. While fully recog-

nising the great energy with which individual teachers in this country
have sought to develop the study of this subject, your Committee cannot
but rei^ard the condition of economic studies at the universities and col-

leges as unsatisfactory. As contrasted with Continental countries and
also with the United States, the United Kingdom possesses no regular

system. In one place Economics is taught in one way, and in connection

with some one subject, not infrequently by the teacher of that subject ; in
another place in another way, and with another subject. Very often it is
taught, or at any rate learnt, as little as possible. In most places this

lack of organisation is due to the weariness of introducing elaborate

schemes for the l^enefit of problematic students. At Cambridge the pass
examination which has recently been devised only attracts a few. With
regard to the higher study of Economics, Professor Marshall, among others,

has written strongly of the comparatively small inducements offered by

Economics as compared with other subjects. He adds : ' Those who do

study it have generally a strong interest in it ; from a pecuniary point of
view they would generally find a better account in the study of something

else.' Some considerations bearing on this point are oti'ered below, but
here it may be observed that tlie attempts to introduce more system into
the teaching of Economics, and to secure for it as a subject of study fuller
public recognition, should, so far as possible, be made together.

      In the opinion of your Committee Economics should be introduced into
the honour courses and examinations of the universities in such a manner
 as to allow students to engage in its thoroucjh and systematic study without

 necessarily going outside the range of degree subjects.

   --(b) The Position of Economics with regard to Professional and other

 Curricida. In most Continental countries Economics occupies a place
more or less prominent in the courses of training and in the examinations
through which candidates for the legal profession or the civil service
have to pass. In Austria, Hungary, and the three southern states of
Germany this connection is very real, and the nature of the study involved
very thorough. The same cannot be said with regard to the Northern
States of the latter empire, where the importance attached to this sub-

ject is so slight as to make its inclusion almost nominal. To some extent
or in some form it is regarded as a subject obligatory on those preparing for
those callings, or, to speak more accurately, for the legal calling and for cer-
tain branches of the civil service in Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and Switzerland. In Holland and Belgium, while a certain general know-

ledge only is required for a few posts or branches of the civil service, a very
thorough study is incumbent on those qualifying for the higher branch of
the legal profession. In both France and Russia it is an integral and
necessary portion of the legal curriculum.

     The two studies are cognate, and according to the view of your Com-

mittee not only would the institution of an examination in Economics at
some stage of legal degrees and qualifications be advantageous professionally,

but the work of those who had enjoyed a legal training would react favour-

ably on the advance of the science. In addition, Economics should receive

a much more important place in the Civil Service Examinations, and should,
if possible, be made compulsory on those entering the higher Ijranches.

                           APPENDIX I.

On the Methods of Economic Training adopted in Forehjn Countries.
                              By E. C. K. Conner.

The comparative study of the Continental and other foreign systems

of Economic Education brings out in clear i-elief certain featui'es of either
difference or coincidence which relate respectively to the impulses or

circumstances giving this particular study its importance, to the method

of study, and, lastly, to its organisation and the degree of success attained

in the various countries.

     (1) Putting on one side the purely scientific impulse to learn for
learning's sake, which can, after all, affect comparatively few, the induce-

ment to a large or considerable number of students to interest themselves

in any particular study must consist in its recognition, either positive or
tacit, as a necessary preliminary to some professions or to certain
positions. This may, as has been suggested, be either direct and positive,

or indirect and tacit ; direct and positive, that is, in the case of Economics
when in either one or more branches they are made part of the examina-

tions  admitting  to  the  legal  profession  and  the  higher  civil  service
                                                                                                  ;

indirect and tacit when public opinion demands economic knowledge as

necessary in those holding prominent positions as citizens or anxious to

direct and control their fellows, either by the pen as joui-nalists, or by
act or word as statesmen or politicians. The importance of both these
motives is, of course, largely increased when they exist in close connection

with the purely scientific impulse. By itself this is not sufficient. The

exclusion of one study, as Economics, from professional or technical curri-
          ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IX THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 367

cula, unless counteracted by the existence of a very powerful popular
sentiment in its favour, practically removes it from tlie reach of students

who have to make themselves ready to earn their living. Of the two

influences, described above, the former, or the actual and positive recog-
nition, is given, in some shape or other, in Austria and Hungary, tlie

southern states of the German Empire, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia, and Holland. In

America, and to some extent in Canada, popular sentiment and interest
supply the needful impetus by making Economics a tacit requisite for
those exercising particular callings. In both Germany and Austria there
are signs of the growth of Economics in popular appreciation. In Austria,
indeed, the circumstances are peculiarly fortunate. Economic instruction
is recognised as a matter of serious importance, while, on the other hand,
economic knowledge is one of the subjects of the State examinations for
the legal and administrative service. In addition, its careful and scientifi.^^

study is pursued by a fair number of advanced students. In this way
Austria occupies a central position among the various nations which range

themselves with America at one extreme, where there is no positive or
direct obligation in favour of economic study, and at the other extreme,
the Scandinavian and lesser Latin countries, where all recognition that
exists is positive, but where this positive recognition is largely nominal.

      It has been urged that the ill-success of economic studies in these
latter countries is largely an argument against their inclusion in obligatory

--curricula a proposition which probably those who make it would hardly

apply to the cases of other subjects. But from the evidence fui-nished by

the countries before us this ill-success can be traced to other causes. It
is due, firstly, to differences in the methods of study, and, secondly, to

the differences in the thing made obligatory. In South Germany, Austria,
and Hungai'y, Economics is obligatory on certain classes of students, and
the study of Economics is making rapid and satisfactory progress ; but
then in South Germany, Austria, and Hungary, the method of study is
one which commends itself to advanced students and educational critics,
and the knowledge required in the examinations is thorough. In the
lesser Latin countries, as Spain and Italy, the knowledge which the
candidate is expected to show is elementary in itself, largely confined to
elementary theory, and a marked unreality is imparted to the whole
study, an unreality recognised alike by examiners, teachers, and students.
On the other hand, the advantages which Economics may receive from its
public and positive recognition are borne witness to by those best
acquainted with the condition of the study in Germany, where the usages
of the north and south differ. Broadly speaking, they consist in the

removal of Economics from the category of unnecessary to the category of

necessary acquirements. Many of those who begin the study from com-

pulsion continue it from choice. In America, indeed, the strength of
popular sentiment and the ever-present interest of politics together with
 the action of the universities, where nearly all studies, and not Economics
 alone, are put on a voluntary footing, give it an adequate position ; but
 failing the combination of conditions such as these, its absence, both from
 all professional curricula and from the earlier stages of education, cannot

 but be regarded as disastrous and unjust.
      (2) The method of economic studies is of a certain importance with

 regard to the subject last discussed. Though it would be unfair to

 estimate the work, or to judge of the scope of schools of economic teaching
                                                          --

368 BEPORT-- 1894.

from their extreme tendencies, these afford not unsatisfactory means of

distinction. Speaking broadly, they may be placed in two groups-- those in

which the dominant influence is realistic or empii'ical ; those in which it is
theoretical or abstract. Very few economists, whether teachers or writers,

are wholly realistic or wholly theoretical. Some bias, however, they
nearly all have, and it is by that they may be ranked for the present
purpose. Nor must it be supposed that the distinctions drawn in one

 country, with regard to these opposing lines of study, at all cori-espond
 with those existing in another. In Germany, for instance, the attitude of

Professor Wagner is attacked by the members of the historical school

--one branch of the empirical but judged by the standards of France and

England he would rank in the main as an empiricist. The theorists of
Germany and Austria do little more than assert that theoretical study
has its due jDlace and is a necessary part of the equipment of an eco-

nomist.

      "When discussing the assertion that compulsory Economics, however
enforced, tended to issue in perfunctory attendances and poor results so
far as interest was concerned, it was urged that these consequences
depended largely on the method and nature of study. This is remarkably
illustrated by the fact that the countries where such evils are regretted
or anticipated are those where the study of Economics is mainly theoretic,
or where Economics is distinctly and openly subordinated to other subjects.
Lessons of this latter kind are never thrown away upon students. But
with regard to the former, it is not from the southern states of the
German Empire, or from Austria, that we hear these complaints. There
economic study is obligatory, and the economic study involved is two-
thirds of it empirical in character. In the Latin countries the state of

things is very different. The basis of study is, if I may say so, text-book

theory, and the position of Economics, so far as progress is concerned, is
unsatisfactory in the extreme. This has been particularly dealt with in
the paragraphs relating to Italy.

     In two of the gi'eat nations the mode of study practised is largely
empirical. In Germany, despite the contrast between different leaders of
thought, the importance of this method is well illustrated by the position
which the study of Practical or Applied Economics invariably occupies.
In America, the study of economic history and of modern economic fact
grows into greater j^rominence year by year.

      (3) Turning to the question of success, the question arises at once as

to the tests whereby such may be measured. Of these, many, varying

from popularity to eclecticism, have been suggested, but possibly the one
most suitable is the ability of a system to produce a high general level
amongst a good number of students. Something more is required of a
system than that it should bring together large audiences for elementary
courses ; while, as for the production of a few very good students, a few
will always press to the front through all difficulties, despite systems good
or bad, or in the absence of any system at all. But a system that is to
be deemed good must place within the reach of all industrious and apt
students the means of a good general economic training, while stimulating
him to prosecute original and independent work. Further, it should

provide these advantages regularly and not intermittently. The way in
which these two needs are met in practice can be stated briefly. General
ti-aining is provided by a systematic series of courses which should include
at least Theory of Economics, Applied Economics, and Finance. The
          ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 3G9

seminar, or classes organised like the seminar, oflfer opportunities for

guiding a student into the ways of original work.
     Seminar instruction is given regularly in Germany, Austria, Hungary,

in the better equipped universities of America, Switzerland, and to some

extent in both Sweden and Holland. In Russia the professors may and

sometimes do organise seminars or discussion classes. In Belgium, classes
are held in connection with some of the courses.

     With regard to the systems of providing for a good ground knowledge

of the leading branches of Economics, classification is rendered difficult

by the different methods adopted in the various countries. Some are

more, some less thorough. Among the former we may put without hesi-

--tation the countries already singled out for notice Germany, America,

Austria, and Hungary.

     From the accounts given in detail below it is clear that in these
countries the study of Economics is advancing. The training is systematic.

A fair proportion of students pass from the more general into the more

special or advanced courses. The production of work, not necessarily of
the first order, for with that we are not dealing, but of the second, or
third, or fourth order, is great and still increases.

       AUSTRIA.

     The position of Economics in Austria is largely determined by its

--relation to legal studies by the place, that is, which its various branches

hold in the examinations qualifying for the legal profession and for the

juridical and higher administrative services. According to the system till

recently in force, but now somewhat modified, candidates intending to

enter these had to attend certain courses at the universities, and to pass

certain examinations varying according to the positions sought. Those

entering the legal profession had to pass the first State examination in

addition to the three j)olitical rigorosa of the university, success in which

latter conferred the degree of Doctor. Other candidates only needed to pass

--the three State examinations. These latter were as follows : The first

(Rechtshistorische Staatspriifung) was held at the end of the second year

of study, and comprised the following subjects : Roman Law, Canon Law,
and German Law in its historical aspect. The second (Judizielle Staats-

priifung) was held towards the end of the eighth semester, in the follow-

ing subjects : Austrian Law, civil, commercial, and penal ; Austiuan Civil

and Criminal Procedure. At the end of the four years came the third

.and final examination (Staatswissenschaftliche Staatspriifung), which alone

is of importance so far as the legal recognition of Economics is concerned.

The subjects examined in were Austrian Public Law, International Law,

Economics (including Economics, the Science of Administration, Finance,

and Statistics). The political rigorosa, while they correspond in outline to

the State examinations, have some few points of difference both with

regard to method and subjects. They, too, are three in number, and may

be described as the Austrian rigorosum, corresponding to the second State

examination, the Ptomanist, corresponding to the first State, and the

Staatswissenschaftliche, which closely resembles the third State examina-

tion, though not including Statistics or Administration. There is no

regulation as to the order in which they are to be passed, but that indi-

cated above is fairly customary. Their greater severity may be judged from

1894.            BB

--370 REPORT 1894.

both the additional length of preparation prescribed and the manner in

which they are conducted. The earliest date at which a candidate may

pass his first rigorosum is at the end of the fourth in place of the

second year. The second and thii-d may follow at respective intervals of

two months. The Staatspriifung is an examination taken by groups of

four students, each group being under examination for two hours ; but in
the rigorosa each candidate is under examination for two hours, spending

half an hour with each examiner. Both State and university examina-

tions are oral, and the latter are said to impose a severe strain on both

examiner and candidate. In the latter the examiners are the university

professors, while in the State examinations these are variously composed

of professors, functionaries of the State, and barristers of good standing.

By the Law of April -8, 1893, which came into effect in October, the
Asystem sketched above underwent certain alterations.
                                                                               complete

separation will be effected between the university examinations or rigorosa

and those qualifying for the legal profession and State services, the

former no longer serving as a possible substitute for the second and third

of the latter. In addition, some slight change has been introduced into

the curriculum and examinations imposed upon students designing to

enter these. They will have to attend courses and to be examined in

(a) The Science of Administration (Verwaltungslehre), and with special

reference to  Austrian    Law                    (6)  Economics,  theoretical  and practical
                                              ;

(o) Public Finance, and especially Austrian Finance. In addition they

must attend lectures (without subsequent examination) on Comparative

and Austrian Statistics. These alterations will leave the number of

students in the more elementary subjects unaffected, and, so far from

operating in discouragement of economic and political studies, will, it is

hoped, lead to their more thorough prosecution, by raising the degree to a

more scholarly position.

The marked recognition of Economics by the State, and the large

number of students wliose prospects are involved in its successful study,

naturally affect the teaching organisation provided by the universities

and other bodies.

This is fairly uniform throughout Austria, as apart from Hungary,

though the extent to which the subject is pursued, and the variety of its

forms, depend mainly on the enthusiasm of particular teachers and the

greater opportunities offered by particular universities or other institu-

tions. At the universities ' the ground plan of work may be described as

identical. Economics being taught in the faculty of law. There are

certain courses which must be delivered, and at which attendance is

obligatory for certain classes of students. These are on National Econoiny,

Finance, Statistics, and the Science of Administration (Verwaltungslehre),

which includes instruction in practical economics, public health, army,

matters of policy, justice, &c. But in addition to these the teachers, whether

professors or privat-docents, may, and often do, deliver special courses

dealing with more particular subjects. These are not necessarily or

usually the same from year to year ; and may be described as instruction

of an unusually high order, inasmuch as each teacher is accustomed to

select for treatment such branch of science in which his own activities

and studies lie. The large ^ voluntary attendance at such lectures is a

          ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 371

testimony to the regard in which eeonoinic studies are held among a large

body of students.

     ·Seminar instruction is customary, as in Germany. At Vienna there

are two seminars, one for Economics (Staatswissenschaftliche), one for
Statistics, while in addition there is an Institute of Political Science,
attached to all of which are libraries and places for the members to carry
on their work in close contact with their professor or his deputy. The
members consist in part of young doctors of the university who have
recently graduated, in part of those preparing for the examinations of
the university, and include, as a rule, several foreigners who have come
to Vienna to pursue their studies. The arrangements at the other uni-
versities are similar, though in some they lack the completeness displayed
at Vienna.

      Students who, having passed their examinations with credit, or other
wise performed their work to the satisfaction of their teachers, wish to
carry on their studies in other countries are eligible for Reisestipendia
(travelling scholarships). These are rewarded to encourage study in
foreign universities, or to enable their holders to carry out investigations
which necessitate a journey. Unfortunately they are but few in number,
and as they are open to students of all faculties, few economists can hope

to obtain them. Among the more recent holders in Vienna are Professors
Bohm-Bawerk, Robert Meyer, Von Phillipovich, and Dr. Stephen Bauer,
the two latter of whom published reports on matters studied abroad.

     In this way a method of economic instruction has been developed in
the Austrian universities which not only provides a large number with a

carefully systematised series of courses, but offers to those disposed to
more thorough or more special study ample opportunity. The more eager
and energetic pass through the courses compulsory for the law degree, in
themselves a fitting preliminary to more detailed work, to attendance at
the special courses and membership of the seminar ; from these they may,
if fortunate, advance into the position of travelling or research scholars of
their university. Though most of the students at the economic lectures

are jurists, the attendance frequently includes members qualifying in

other faculties, or even more general ' hearers.' At Krakau, students

of the philosophical faculty form some 20 to 25 per cent, of the total.
All these students are entirely free so far as their choice of economic
courses is concerned. It is not possible to give the exact numbers of
the students to be described respectively as elementary and advanced.
The particulars, however, furnished by the various universities permit a
rough general estimate. Not fewer than one thousand students undergo
the more general courses, thus attaining to a fair systematic acquaintance
with the main branches of economic study, while out of that number more
than two hundred take special courses and enter the various seminars.
This account rather under than over estimates the extent to which

economic studies extend. As to the character of the advanced work
there is no doubt. As has been pointed out, it is of a high order. But

.some question has been raised as to the value of the knowledge likely to
be attained by the more general student. The variety of subjects required
in the examinations either of the university (political rigorosa) or of the
State, and the number of courses obligatory on the students, do not allow
of an early specialisation. ' But a glance at the nature of the examination,

      ' This, as Professor von Slilewski contends, interferes with the scientific character
                                                                                                                 BB2

and at the syllabus of the various courses, forbids the inference that
the instruction given is of a purely rudimentary nature.

     Much, it is true, depends upon the personal enthusiasm and force of
the teacher, for, despite the obligation of attendance, a dull and unin-

teresting lecture will rarely obtain the audiences registered to him,

many students preferring to buy copies of the course hectographed from

the notes of their predecessors in the lecture room, and only troubling
themselves to appear at the l^eginning and end of the semester.

      In the University of Krakau, Economics is obligatory, both in

study and examination, for the students of agriculture who attend

special lectures, apart, that is, from the law students. Instruction
in Economics (Political Economy, Finance, and Statistics) is given al.'?o
at all the Technical High Schools (Technische Hochschulen) in
 Austria,' while attendance at the courses (though without examination)
is obligatory at the schools of agriculture, where similar conditions pre-

vail. At the Commercial Academies (Handelsakademien) of Vienna and

Prague a course of lectures is given with particular reference to the
 economic branches which throw most light on commercial facts and
features, and on the relations existing between the various classes engaged
in industry and trade. To obtain the diploma of these institutions the
lectures are followed by an examination. Courses are provided for tlie
consular service at the Oriental Akademie in Vienna, and for the
 service of the administration of the army.'^ There is also a Fortbildung-
 schule for officials of the railway, where political economy is taught and
examined in. Members of these courses are considered specially fitted
for the attainment of the higher posts in their service.

    A knowledge of Economics, duly and doubly certified by registered

lecture courses and by examination, is a necessary preliminary to certain
 careers. Attendance at the university lectures and the attainment of the

juridical degree are the qualification for the higher branches of the legal
 profession (advocate, &c.), and like attendance and degree, or, in the
 place of the latter, the diploma of public service, are required for all
 branches of the legal profession and for the whole civil service. Entrance

into the consular and diplomatic services may also be obtained through

 the courses of the Oriental Academy. Further, as has been pointed out
 above, a certain acquaintance, or supposed acquaintance, with economic
 studies is considered necessary in some other vocations.

      At the present time very considerable importance is attached to

 economic studies in Austria. Their scientific character is a general
 matter of care, and an extension of the sphere in which they are obli-

 gatory, or at least advisable on the part of those who seek success in their

 particular calling or profession, is earnestly advocated by some. In the

--first direction the reforms in the juridical studies at the universities will

 operate. As Dr. Mataja writes : ' Economics will have greater and not

 of the various studies required for the degree. As each has to take up several sub-
 jects, and to pass examinations in these, he cannot give very special attention to
 Economics or any other branch of social science in which he may happen to bo

 interested.

   --' Of these there are six : Vienna, Briinn. Graz, Prag (German), Prag (Bohemian),

 Lemberg (Polish). After examination diplomas are granted, which are necessary
 for those becoming teachers in agricultural schools, and are, it is said, a strong
 recommendation in the eyes of landlords when engaging their officials, agents, &c.

less weight.' On the other hand, and in the other direction, different
suggestions have been made. Some advocate the extension of compulsory
study to engineers who will become officials and directors in factories, to

the einployes of the fiscal service, to those attending the more elementary
technical schools. Others would like to see schools of political and social
science (including Economics) founded in the great industrial centres.
Whether these suggestions be carried out or not, they serve to illustrate
the feeling which exists, at least on the part of some, with regard to the
value of Economics both as a special and as a branch of general study.

                                                  HUNGARY.

     Economics holds a position somewhat similar to that in Austria. It
is obligatory on all students in the faculty of law and political science at
the two universities,' and in the Rechtsakademien (legal faculties, as at
Kassa), who must take courses in Economics and Finance before the end
of their second year, when they have to pass an examination, among the
subjects of which these are included. After the second year their studies
bifurcate, according to the degree which they seek (Dr. Juris, or Dr.
Politics). In order to obtain the former, they must also pass an ex-
amination in financial law. But if they wish to take the latter degree
(Dr. Politics), they must pass two rigorosa, among the subjects of which
are Economics (theoretical and practical). Finance, Finance Law, and
Statistics. The knowledge required in this case is exceedingly thorough,
and the degree is of high value in the public service. There ar3 also
State examinations which serve as qualifications, though to a lesser extent,
for the legal and administrative services. Though easier, they correspond
closely with the above. In the universities the system of economic study
in its general features resembles that in vogue in Austria, the chief
courses being those on Economics and Finance ; but both at Budapest and
Klausenburg (Kalozsvar), as, for instance, at Strassburg to take a parallel,
these studies belong not to a sole legal faculty, but to a legal and political
faculty (Rechts- und Staatswissenschaftliche Fakulttit). In addition to
successful examinations the candidates have to present a thesis. The
possession of the degree of Dr. Cameralium implies a very sound economic
training, and it was till lately the chief means of entering the higher civil
service both of the kingdom and of the States. Considerable attention is
paid to Economics, the seminai-s being well frequented, and the interest
and activity of students great. This is particularly true of Budapest,
where the lectures are varied and delivered by a numerous and able

 staff.

                                                   GERMANY.

      The differences in the history and regulations of the various States
composing the German Empire have led, not unnaturally, to considerable

differences in the positions which economic studies occupy. On the one

 hand, they are affected by the diversity of usage existing as to their con-
 nection with the course of study required for the legal profession and the

civil service. On the other hand, the particular faculty in which they are

 included has been determined by reasons possessing little but historical

 validity.

    --1. Prussia. At the Prussian universities Economics belongs to the

faculty of philosophy, and, speaking generally, to that section of this

Afaculty known as the Sciences of the State.                                                                              student takes his degree

in Economics entirely apart from law, the position of which as a separate

faculty unfortunately precludes a student who presents a thesis in one of

these two subjects from selecting the other as one of the two collateral

subjects which he is bound by regulation to otfer himself for examination

in. Further, it must be noticed that the degree of doctor in this country,

and, indeed, in Germany generally, is not a qualification, as was till recently

the case in Austria and still is in certain of the Latin countries. Some
assistance it may be in a judicial career, buteven then the degree of Doctor

Juris has naturally much more value than that of Doctor of Philosophy

in the State Sciences.

    Nor does Economics occupy an important place in the State examina-

tions which qualify for the legal and administrative services. To enter

these a candidate must pass examinations, the first of which is common to

both services {re/erendar Examen). This consists of two parts, the first

written and dealing with law, the second oral, which includes, aiiiong

other matters, the elements of Economics. So subordinate is this subject

that, in the opinion of many critics, it hardly counts in the decision as to

the eligibility of candidates. The course of examination then bifurcates,

some taking that for Justiz- Assessor, others for that of Regierungs

Assessor, for neither of which is Economics required. At the latter of

place some five years after the conclusion of the university course, the

demands it makes are chiefly met by knowledge supplied from books.

With regard to the constitution of the examining boards, it should be

noticed that, even at the referendar Examen, it is not in accordance with

common practice to include professors of Economics.

   --2. Saxony. The system recently adopted in Saxony is, in so far as the

subordination of Economics is concerned, nearly identical with that of

Prussia. In one point it is more favourable to the interests of this

subject, the professoriate being invariably represented on the board of

examiners.

   --3. Reichsland. In the Reichsland Economics is of no more importance

than it is in Prussia.

   --4. Saxe- Weimar. In Saxe-Weimar, too, it is of but nominal import-

ance in the juridical examinations. There, too, the board of examiners is

constituted irrespective of economic requirements, and, as has been causti-

cally said, it is rare to find the examiners academically qualified in the

subjects in which they are supposed to examine. The position, in the

main, is very similar to that prevailing in Prussia.

    5. Bavaria.-- In the chief southern and south-western states Eco-

nomics holds a more important position in the legal and civil service

curricula. Thus, in Bavaria, all students of law, administration, and

forest (Landwirth) have to pass an examination in which it forms one of

the subjects. The time of the examination is at the conclusion of the

four years devoted to legal or other studies respectively, and the presence

of the Professor of National Economy among the professorial examiners

necessitates due attendance at lectures and thorough study. The second

examination for the civil service is technical in character, and only
          ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 375

requires economic knowledge in its connection with practical developments

--and issues.
     6. Wiirtemburg. In Wiirtemburg, though Economics forms no part
of the strictly legal examinations, in the other State examinations for
administrative students it is of very great importance. For these there
are two examinations, the first of which, more general in character than
the other, takes place at Tiibingen, and involves a very considerable

acquaintance with Economics.

   --7. Baden. Every legal student, as well as every candidate seeking

entrance into the higher employments in the State departments of revenue
and administration, must, in his time, attend lectures on, and pass exami-

nations in, the economic and financial sciences.
     The varying positions which Economics holds in the examinations

qualifying for State and legal employment in the different German States
affect a large number of university students who have to pass these
examinations but do not of necessity take a degree. To them the con-

nection of Economics with one faculty or the other in the university

cannot be a matter of much importance, but with others the case is

different. Students reading for the degree are, as has been already said,

restricted now on one side, now on another, as to their choice of collateral

subjects for examination. Sometimes they can offer Economics in connec-
tion with law, sometimes they cannot. In addition, the influence which

kindred studies taught in one faculty may bring to bear on the methods

of instruction may, in some instances, prove of not inconsiderable import-
ance even in the case of the students studying for the doctorate. Professor
Brentano, however, whose personal experience extends from Leipzig to
Strassburg, from Vienna to Breslau and Munich, contends that the
varieties of combination matter less than might seem probable. The
facultative position of Economics varies considerably. In Prussia and

Saxony they find place among the many heterogeneous subjects grouped

together in the faculty of philosophy, though in certain places, as at

Berlin, they fall into a distinct subdivision. At Berlin they belong to
the Staats- Cameral- nnd Gewerheioissenschaften. At Strassburg (Reiclis-
land)they combine with law to form a Rechts- nnd Staatswissenschaftliche,
 Facultdt. At Tiibingen (Wiirtemberg) a Sfaatsivissenscha/tliche Faculldt

 exists independent of the law, a practice identical with that current at

Munich (Bavaria). At some universities, as for instance at Jena, economic

 lectures are largely attended by the students of Landwirth)ichaft.

    A comparison of the studies preliminary to the doctorate in Germany

with those in Austria reveals two chief points of difference. At German

 universities there is little prescription of the course of study, or, indeed,

 of the methods to be adopted by the student, who within certain wide
 limits has a perfectly free choice of subjects. But this comparative

 freedom from restraint is closely connected with the great importance
 attached to the thesis, a custom which, its critics urge, leads to premature
 specialisation. In both countries candidates for the civil and legal services

 are much more closely restricted to definite courses.

       In their practical working the systems of the different universities
 bear a close resemblance, at any rate in their earlier stages. There are
 three main courses, delivered annually, on pure Economics, Applied
 Economics, and Finance, all of which, even the first, involve a careful study
 of economic fact as distinct from hypothesised theory. The extent to
 which the method adopted in the first course is empirical depends, of
----

course, on the position of the teacher as an adhei-ent of one or other of
the opposing schools of economic thought ; but, speaking generally, even
the least empirical among them would be deemed empiiical by those
accustomed to English methods. But, in addition to these three annual

courses, lectures are delivei'ed on special subjects. At Freiburg (in
Baden), in the summer semester of 1891, these were :

     History of National Economy and Socialism.
     Agrarian and Industrial Policy, including the Labour Question.

      History of Statistics.

The list of special lectures at Berlin, to take the most completely equipped
of the universities, shows more clearly the wide range of subjects dealt
with under the term Economics. In the summer term, 1892, besides the
ordinary annual courses, tiiere were courses of lectures on the following

subjects :

     Theory of Statistics.
      History of Statistics.
      Statistics of the (Jerman Empire.

     The Economic and Social History of Germany from the end of the'
          Middle Ages to the Peace of Westphalia.

     Histoi'y and Modes of Industrial Undertakings.
     Money and Banking.
      Early Commercial and Colonial Policy (till 1800).
     Industrial and Commercial Policy.
     The Social Question.
     Forms of Public Credit.

In addition to lectures, necessarily more or less foi-nial, opportunities are

afforded for systematic instruction in classes and in the seminar. The

latter institution varies considerably, according to the character of the

students frequenting particular universities, for its efficiency, and accord-

ing to the position of the professor undertaking it, for the direction of its

studies. Each teacher collects around himself a group of students who

follow his method, adopt his attitude, and frequently devote themselves to

those branches of economic i-esearch which have occupied his attention.

Thus, at Strassburg, Professor Knapp's seminar deals chiefly with agrarian

questions                                 at  Berlin,  Professor  Wagner's  influence  is  seen  in  the  pre-
                                       ;

dominance of finance and financial topics among the subjects discussed.

At Munich, to pnss to the question of organisation and method, the two

professors join in holding a seminar in which 'there are about twenty-four

young men taking part. Kach of them has to undertake some work : the
younger ones get a book to read, and have to report on it ; the more

advanced have to treat a subject after reading sevei-al books on the

subject; the mo.st advanced have to make a work themselves, the pro-

fessors aiding them in furnishing material and giving assistance.' At

some universities there are two seminars, at others one. It is a matter

for regret that, with all these opportunities, a comparatively small number

of students are ranked as advanced. The explanations offered are many,

but probably a very adverse effect on the study is produced by the paucity

of the positions to which a thorough economic study can serve as an intro-

duction. Teaching posts are few, and the requirements in the State

examinations for the legal and administrative services are, if not as in

many cases nominal, strictly limited to an elementary knowledge.
          ON ECONOMIC TRAraiNG IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 377

     In some of the technical schools, and in all the schools of commerce,
instruction in some branch of Economics forms part of the regular course,
and, in these latter, an examination is held. In the former, however, the
subjects thus taught are distinctly subordinated to the technical sciences,
which occupy the chief attention of the students, while in the schools of
commerce only those branches receive adequate^ treatment which bear or
appear likely to bear upon commerce in its practical aspects.

HOLLAND.

     The connection between the universities and the legal profession is
close in Holland, none but doctors of jurisprudence being qualified to

practise as advocates. This is a circumstance which has a material effect
upon the study of Economics, inasmuch as this, in its more elementary
branches, forms one of the obligatory subjects of the first examination for

the degree. Thus, so far as this one profession is concerned, a certain

knowledge of Economics is necessitated.

In the higher administrative service no such knowledge is obligatory,

but it is considered that officials who possess the degree of Doctor of

Political Science have better chances of promotion. For this degree a

thorough study of Economics is required. In certain other Government

services demand is made for acquaintance with certain branches of the

subject. In the examinations for the consular service the 'General

Principles of Economics ' and the ' Elements of Statistics,' chiefly with
Aregard to trade and shipping, form subjects of examination.
                                                              similar

knowledge is required for the diplomatic service. In none of these cases,

it should be noted, is attendance at specified courses compulsory. The

subject forms part of the examination.
     The requirements indicated above explain to some extent the position

which Economics occupies in the four Dutch universities. It is a neces-

--sai-y subject for two degrees the doctorate in laws and the doctorate in

political" science. But the nature of the knowledge required differs
greatly. In the former it is elementary, not going beyond the first

principles of the theory, while in the latter case the examination necessi-

tates a really careful and detailed study. In addition to the general

course of lectures taken by all, candidates for this latter^ distinction

usually attend two other courses, one in capita selecta (taxation, finance,

socialism, &c.), and another in statistics. These courses, unlike those at
German universities, extend throughout the academic year-- i.e. from

September to July. For advanced students discussion classes are held,

wliere the students, after a previous study of a chosen subject, meet_ to

discuss it among themselves and with the professv,-.. Before proceeding

to the degree of Doctor a candidate has to write, and afterwards to

defend, a dissertation on some branch of the general science which he has

taken up. Thus, in the case of political science, the thesis may be on

some economic question. Outside the universities the chief study oi

Economics takes place in the intermediate schools, where, during the

fourth and fifth years of the five years' curriculum, it is taught for two

hours weekly by a Doctor of Political Science, or by another teacher duly

qualified by a special examination. At the Polytechnic at Delft there

is a chair of Economics, but neither is attendance at the course obligatory,

nor does it form one of the subjects of examination.

378          REPORT-- 1894.

             BKLGIUM.

By the Law of 1890, which provides the regulation for higher

instruction, poHtical economy is made obligatory for the attainment of

the degree of Doctor of Laws, a distinction proving a professional qualifi-

cation, and for the grade of engineer, the course for the former involving

some forty-five lectures, that for the latter some fifteen. In both cases

the subject is taken in the earlier years of study. Students training for

these professions would appear to form the great bulk of those attending

economic lectures at the universities. In neither case can the course be

said to furnish more than elementary instruction.

The universities have made provision outside these State requirements

for more advanced students. The candidates for the degree of Doctor

of Political Science have to show a more thorough acquaintance with

economic subjects. At the University of Ghent the course which is

provided for them is considerably longer ; still more stringent regulations

prevail at the University of Louvain for the degree of ' docteur en

^sciences politiques et sociales.'  The important regulations are as

follows :

                                    Art, 5.

     The list of lectures for the two years' curriculum, 1892-3, 1893-4, is

     Seminar or class instruction is given at the universities, though the

particular form it takes varies with the other organisation provided, and

the character of the students. At the University of Ghent a class

supplementary to the lectures is formed, where discussion takes place
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

                               ITALY.

     Outside the universities there are in Italy but few institutions which

give much instruction in Economics. Though courses are delivered at the
superior schools of commerce, as, for instance, at Genoa, Venice, and

Bari, and the Polytechnic School of Milan, which compare in their nature
with those existing at similar places in Austria and Germany, the main

aim of such schools, and the limited extent to which they are frequented,
prevent them from obtaining any control over the development of

economic teaching in the country. It is, then, to the universities that

we must look for information as to the methods chiefly employed. At

them Economics is studied as a subsidiary subject to law, being taken by
students in their second year. There are three courses at which attend-
ance, or, to speak more accurately, inscription is obligatory on legal

students. In the case of the three obligatory courses the attendance is

fairly regular, owing, it is said, to the combined effect of the latitude
allowed in the teaching of the subject and the position of the professor as
examiner. Without passing the economic examinations students cannot
attain to legal degrees. The courses are those in Economic Theory and

Administration, Finance, and Statistics. According to the condition of
the university these are taught by the same or ditfei-ent teachers, in most

cases by the professors who are appointed and paid by the State. In

addition to these courses others are given at the option of the teachers,

either professors or docents. The attendance at these is not good, though

in many cases a large number of students enter themselves as a mark of
courtesy towards the lecturer. It costs them nothing, as they pay a
compound fee, and it benefits him considerably if a docent, as he receives
from the State a payment proportionate to the number of students

registered for his courses. In addition to the examination, a candidate
for the legal degrees presents a thesis which may, and not infrequently
does, deal with some economic subject.' The study of Economics is,

moreover, obligatory on students seeking the higher official careers.

Many complaints are made as to the position occupied by economic

studies in Italy. Their connection with law creates no doubt a certain

and a large audience  in  the  lecture  room                        but, as  one Italian  professor
                                                                 ;

points out, students do not remain there long enough to acquire anything

like a sufficient knowledge of the subject. They come from the schools

wholly unprepared, and they leave the university without having under-

gone a training thorough enough to counterbalance the loose economic

notions gathered from their more diligent study of the newspapers. The

study of economic facts does not seem to have had sufficient place in the

universities of Italy. Attempts are now being made to remedy this

defect by the formation of discussion societies among the students of

Economics, and the encouragement of research into statistical and similar

questions.

    At the minor technical schools lectures are delivered on Elementary

Economics, Finance, and Statistics.

    ' Professor TuUio Martello calculates that at the University of Bologna some
15 per cent, of those graduating in Law present a thesis dealing with Economics.
380 REPORT-- 1894.

                                                             RUSSIA.

     The conditions under which Economics is tauglit in Russia bear a
superficial resemblance to those prevalent in the Latin countries, where it
is annexed to the study of law, and pursued very much as a subject of

secondary importance. Here, too, it forms part of the regular training
through which a jurist must pass in his four years' curriculum. There are
three economic courses which he must attend, and in the subject-matter

of which he must display sufficient knowledge in the May State examina-

tions. These are on Economic Theory, Statistics, &c., and Finance. In
.addition to formal lectures, the professors in charge of the subject may,
and sometimes do, organise classes, discussion societies, or seminars,
though attendance at these is not obligatory.

     The provision for further and more detailed study is considerable.

A student who has finished his law studies with a diploma of the first

degree can remain in the university, if he wishes, for more special research in
one or other subject (Roman Law, Political Economy, Private Law, Financial
Law, &c.), under the supervision of the sjiecial professor or professors. Such
a student is examined, and, if successful, obtains the title of Magistrandus
of the subject in question. Then he must present a dissertation and
defend it, after which he obtains the degree of Magister. After a second
dissertation and disputation ho attains the higher degree of Doctor of his

special subject.

                                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

     The conditions under which the study of Economics is carried on in
the United States of America are widely different from those which pre-

vail in the countries of Continental Europe. On the one hand, there is no
inducement held out to students by its inclusion among the subjects of
State or professional examinations. On tlie other, there is evidence in the

importance which such subjects have assumed at the universities and
colleges of a strong public sentiment in favour of their careful study far
exceeding that in existence either in these countries or in the United
Kingdom. In one respect the regulations of the colleges have had an
important effect, independent of the action which they have taken in re-
spect of the strong public demand. Owing to the freedom of the students
in most of these institutions from prescribed and compulsory courses of
study in most stages of their career, Economics has escaped being rele-
 gated, as, for instance, in England, to the position of a subject outside the
 usual curriculum, and optional only in some one or, perhaps, two stages.

Where such prescription does exist it is not deemed a subject necessarily

 unfit to form part of a compulsory general course. Its inclusion, to some
 extent, would probably be demanded by the strong public opinion which
 has grown up during the past twenty years.

      The causes of the popularity of Economics are stated with fair unani-
 mity by various writers, though their respective importance is very
 differently estimated. In the first place, the very novelty of economic

 studies is itself in favour of their ardent prosecution. Till comparatively
 recently, it has been said till between 1870 and 1880, they were disre-

 garded because unknown. Now they are seized, studied, and followed

 because they offer, or seem to offer, an explanation of the vast and com-
ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 381

plex economic condition which is in process of rapid evolution in this

--country at once so great and so new. So, too, in England some half-

century back or more the theories of the economists of that time were

received by large numbers as an intellectual gospel. But in the next place

the circumstances attending this ' novelty ' of study have considerable

consequences. That the study of Economics is a novel study is important,

but it is of equal importance that it is novel at the present time and under

present conditions. The American economists have not to shake off the

half-uttered, half-silent opprobrium attached to their subject through the

action of the more numerous though less conspicuous of their predecessors

in their rigid adherence to incomplete or ill-founded theories. They are

fortunate in entering upon their teaching at a time when the need of in-

ductive inquiry and training is more fully recognised. This gives a

more systematic aspect to the economic instruction demanded from them

than was the case in England. In the third place, the campaign in

favour of civil service and tariff reform has drawn a great deal of

attention to those departments which deal with finance and the more

prominent aspects of political life. Lastly, it is urged that the political

eagerness which so largely affects the younger generation of Americans

combines with the foregoing to crowd the economic lecture rooms with

anxious and willing students. Economics is needed by politicians, and
' we are all politicians,' writes one professor ; it is needed by journalists
both because they are keen for political knowledge themselves and

because they write for politicians.

The same causes which stimulate economic students have often led to

its connection with political science, with history, and in some instances

with general sociology.

     Returns from several of the universities show the large number of
students who attend economic lectures, and the comparatively large number
who pass into advanced courses. The universities differ so much among them-
selves that no common standard of teaching exists. In some the elementary

courses are very elementary, in others more thorough than might be con-
cluded from the name. Thus at Harvard these include a study of Mill's

' Principles of Political Economy,' lectures on general theory, or on what is

termed Descriptive Economics, including a survey of financial legislation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

while in addition a course is provided on the Economic History of England
and America since the Seven Years' War. In some cases a great part of
the junior work consists in the use of text-books, and proceeds rather by
class instruction and interrogation than by lecture. Turning to the con-

sideration of the courses organised for the more advanced students, it is

highly satisfactory to note the very considerable proportion which these

form of the total number engaged in economic study. According to the

information collected from various quarters, at Harvard they amount to

some 38 per cent., at Columbia College to 41 per cent., at Cornell to

26 per cent. At some others they do not pi-esent so favourable an appear-

ance, though at Michigan I am informed that the twenty returned as

' advanced                                                           consist  entirely  of  very advanced  students, all the others

being included under the heading of elementary. No doubt students

described as advanced at one institution may not be so regarded at others

for, as has been already suggested, these vary very greatly as regards both

their courses and the attainments of their students. "With regard to the

former, those provided at some of the better known and more highly

developed and equipped universities afford a description of the nature of

      There are few universities which do not offer some courses beyond

 these on elementary theory and history. As a rule, finance and some
 other branch of Applied Economics are added. Where graduate schools
 have been established, as, for instance, at Harvard and at Michigan, the
 study proceeds very much on the lines indicated above, so far as the
 former is concerned. At Michigan, the advanced courses are distinguished

 into intermediate and graduate. Intermediate courses treat of the follow-

--ing : The Transportation Problem. Principles of the Science of Finance.

 Theory of Si atistics. History and Principles of Currency and Banking.
 History of the Tariff in the United States. History and Theory of Land
 Tenure and Agrarian Movements. Industrial and Commercial Develop-
 ment of the United States. History and Theory of Socialism and Com-

 --munism. History of Political Economy. Graduate courses : Critical
          ON ECONOMIC TRAINING IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 383

Analysis of Economic Thought. Critical Examination of the Labour
Problem and the Monopoly Problem.

     Most universities have, in addition, established seminars, where study
proceeds on the lines with which Continental students are familiar. In-
dividual members, in most instances graduates, and all advanced students,
undertake particular subjects, on which they prepare reports or treatises
to be read and discussed at the weekly meeting. During their researches
they are more or less under the direction of the professor or teacher who
undertakes the courses in connection with the department of Economics

under which their subject falls. At Yale there are two seminaries and

one discussion society ; at Columbia College there is one for students

who have studied only one year, two (in Economics and Finance) for
those who are more advanced. The value of the work produced differs,
of course, with the character of the university. At Harvard and the other

more highly developed universities it is naturally very high.

      In certain other countries the attention given to the subject of
Economics demands for different reasons less detailed notice. In some
instances the resemblance to countries already described renders further
description superfluous ; in others the geographical limitations of the
 country, or the comparative absence of opportunities for such special

branches of the higher education, necessitate a much slighter notice than

that given to the foregoing countries.
      In Spain the connection between economic and legal studies is very

similar to that existing in Italy. Students of the first and second year
attend courses in Economics and Finance, Statistics being apparently

nowhere insisted upon. At some of the universities an attempt is made

to supplement these elementary courses by conferences and by visits, both
to industrial undertakings, as factories, mines, <ic., and to financial
 establishments, as banks ; while the introduction of sociological institutes
 or seminars is looked for at others, as, for instance, at Oviedo.

      In Sweden ' there are two professors of Political Economy, one at the
 University of Upsala, one at the University of Lund, both belonging to the
 Faculty of Law, and teaching in addition to Political Economy some
 purely juridical subjects. There are also two professors in Politics and
 Statistics, one at Upsala, one at Lund, both belonging to the Faculty of
 Arts, and teaching at their discretion Public Law, either Swedish or
 foreign, and Statistics.' ' The two professors of Political Economy in the

 Faculty of Law have to prepare and examine all the students who go in

 for the State examinations for entrance to the different branches of the

 civil service. But as Political Economy possesses very little importance
 in any of the three forms of these examinations, as compared with Juris-
 prudence,' little stress is laid on its study in this faculty. Of the two

 other professors, one (at Upsala) lectures chiefly on Politics, the other on

 Statistics, both these studies being optional for the two Arts degrees. The
 theory of Political Economy is not taught. Seminar instruction is ar-

 ranged to supplement that given in the lecture courses.
       In Norway, at the University of Christiania, the system is nearly

 identical with that of Sweden. There, too, it is found that, owing to the
 complete subordination of Economics to Law, the knowledge required is

 elementary in character.

       The same impulses which direct the attention of young Americans
 to the study of Economics are felt in Canada. At the University of

Toronto the importance attached to such studies is adequately shown by
the large attendances present at the several courses. These courses are
carefully arranged and graduated so as to furnish the student with a
sound knowledge of the various branches of the subject, and to fit him to
undertake, as he is expected to do in his latter years, research into some
branch of economic fact.

     In Switzerland, the position held by economic studies is, on the whole,

Aat least as favourable as that in the southern countries of Germany.

knowledge of Economics is obligatory on those entering the legal profession,
while, owing to the arrangements made, the duty of examining the can-
didates may, and in practice, I believe, does fall largely on the university
professors. Moreover, in the university curricula, the place of Economics,
so far as Berne is concerned, is very fortunate. True, the subject is

optional, as indeed are all subjects for the doctorate, but it may be

taken for either the legal or the philosophical doctorate (Dr. Juris or Dr.

Phil.). At the Ziirich Polytechnicon it is taught, being obligatory in

some form or other for the diplomas of Forestry and Agriculture. In addition
there is a fair voluntary attendance at these lectures. The system of
instruction presents no features requiring particular notice. The chief
courses are on National Economy and Finance, with the frequent addition
of Practical Economics. These are supplemented by special courses at
the option of the teacher, and by the seminar.

              On Economic Studies in France. By Henry Higgs.

     Economic teaching in France, so far as it consists of lectures regularly
delivered at the same place by the same person, is to be looked for in

       (i.) The College de France, Paris;
      (ii.) The Conservatoire des Arts et Me'tiers, Paris;
     (iii.) The Universite de France, consisting of the aggregate of local

                ' universities,' or faculties officially recognised, in Paris and the

                     pi'ovinces
                                                                                              ;

     (iv.) The free or unofficial faculties and schools in Paris and the pro-

                  vinces, including all the Catholic ' universities ' (which cannot
                come to terms with the State on the question of the faculty of
                theology), the Fcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, Paris, and

                     others.

   A certain amount of economic instruction is also imparted in the

Fcoles supe'rieures div Commerce, generally endowed by the municipalities
of commercial towns. Elementary notions of Economics are officially
prescribed as part of the programme of elementary schools.

      (i.) It is at the College de France that one expects to find leading
teachers of Economics in France. The traditions of its chair (which
was founded in 1830), and the authority vested in its occupants,
added to the attractions of a scientific post in Paris, have been a sufficient
inducement for the most eminent economists to offer themselves for
appointment here. The stimulus of contact with growing, vigorous, and
                                                                                                    ----

inquiring minds is not, however, afforded to the professors, and they liave

to tight against a tendency to fall into prosy sermons and easy repetitions

of old theory. No fees are charged to the students, nor is any record kept

of their names unless they wish to obtain certificates. The lectures are

delivered twice a week (two on Economics by M. Leroy-Beaulieu, and two
on Statistics by M. Levasseur), in the afternoons. The auditors are for

the most part a casual collection of shifting persons, of whom many are
foreigners passing through Paris, who attend once or twice out of curiosity

to see the lecturer. There is no discussion either during or after the
lectures. The professors are paid a fixed stipend by the State. They

appear to regard their lectures in the main as vehicles for the dissemina-

tion of generally received economic theory. So far, however, as they

employ their leisure in prosecuting original research, their stipends may

be regarded as an endowment for the advancement of Economics. Their

personal examples are stimulating. It would be difficult to mention two

more active economists in Europe. But in their lectures they are perhaps

too dogmatic to supply students with the zest of grappling with ' unsettled

questions,' or with the incentive to enlarge, however little, the bounds of
knowledge by pointing out to their hearers the frontiers of ignorance

which are often in sight.

    (ii.) The oldest chair of Political Economy is in the Conservatoire des
Arts et Metiers, and was first filled, in 1819, by J. B. Say. The instruction
now given here is of a more popular character, consisting of lectures

addressed to the working classes at a late hour of the evening. M. Levas-

seur delivers a five-year cycle of about fifty lectures a year on Economics,
and M. de Foville a four-year cycle on Industry and Statistics. There are
on the average from 300 to 400 auditors. They pay no fees. The pro-

fessors are appointed and paid by the Government.

    (iii.) By a law passed in 1877 Economics was for the first time officially

incorporated into the organisation of higher education in France, by being
made an obligatoi-y subject in the second year's studies of the faculties oi
law. Economics in France lias, it is said, laboured under the disadvantage

of offering no opening for a career. On the other hand, the youth of tlie

country flock to the schools of law, for to lawyers all careers are open

politics, journalism, literature, education, legal practice, and many official
appointments. The professor of Law is overworked, and the professor of

Economics underworked. The faculty of Law, therefore, generally expects

of its pi-ofessor of Economics that he shall be able to help in legal instruc-

tion and examinations                                                                          and  there has been a tendency to select a lawyer
                                                                                            ;

rather than an economist for these chairs. This reproach, however, is

rapidly being removed, and the new professors of Economics are in many

cases vigorous and promising in their proper spheres. Economics has

recently been transferred from the second to the first year's programme.

The law students are said to show a better intelligence of law now that

they also study Economics. It can hardly yet be stated what effect this

organisation will produce on Economics itself.

    In addition to this obligatory study. Economics may be taken as one of
the eight optional courses at a later period of preparation in the Law

faculties. For this purpose there is generally a special course of lectures
on Finance, in which financial legislation is a prominent topic ; but the

option in favour of Economics is not much exercised.

     The professors and lecturers in Economics and (in italics) in Finance

in the official faculties of Law are as follows :

      On the Condition of Economic Studies in the United Kingdom.
                                  By E. C. K. GoNNER.

      Though the full extent of the disadvantages under which economic
 study in this country suffers can only be realised from a fairly detailed
 account of its position in the various universities and with relation to

 certain professions, it will not be out of place to preface this report with a
 few words as to their nature.

      (a) In the tirst place it is a matter of serious concern that Economics
 is not regarded as a necessary part of any professional curriculum. This
 particular hardship, however, might be faced with comparative equanimity
 were there existent in this country, as for instance in the United States
 of America, a strong body of popular feeling in support of its study and
 its efficient teaching. But, despite frequent assertions to the contrary, I

 believe, and in this I shall have the concurrence of many colleagues engaged

 in teaching, that there is no such body of feeling. Its absence has been
 variously accounted for. To a great extent it is no doubt part of the
legacy of distrust and misunderstanding due to the false view of Economics
 placed before a former generation, and it will probably be a long time
before the popular conception of an economist as a compound of text-book
theory and ignorance of fact can be entirely dispelled.

     (i) Owing largely to the early prominence of the abstract school of
economic thought in England, the position which the subject holds in the

--university curricula is far from satisfactory. It is often treated as a subject

narrow in scope and subordinate necessarily and naturally subordinate
to other subjects. But this is by no means the position which it should hold,
ajid now that the importance of the studies of economic fact and adminis-
tration is more clearly seen, the impossibility of effective teaching within

the prescribed lines has become glaringly apparent. At present indeed

English economic teaching is without a regular system. It is usually sup-
posed that prescribed university courses should offer a means of systematic
training in the various subjects, the pass courses of ordinary training, the
honours courses of advanced and thorough training. So far as Economics

is concerned, this is precisely what the universities do not provide. With
some possible exception they offer at the present time little more than

general opportunities of showing economic knowledge in examinations
primarily devoted to other subjects.

     In the United Kingdom the encouragement of the study of Economics

rests entirely with educational bodies. So far as professional examina-
tions and curricula are concerned it meets with almost universal neglect.
This is wholly so with regard to the examinations qualifying for the
practice of law, either as barrister or solicitor, and partly so in the case of

the Civil Service Examinations. For these latter Economics may be taken
up, as may almost any other subject included in the Sciences and Arts.

It is not recognised, that is to say, as more cognate to the administrative
callings for which these examinations qualify, than is chemistry, for
instance ; indeed, in comparison with many of these other subjects it is at

a discount owing to tho smaller maximum of marks assigned to it. In

other worJi, it is excluded from the legal curriculum ; in the Civil

                                                                                                                              cc2

Service Examinations it is an optional but not an important subject.

Elementary Political Economy is one of the optional subjects in the

examination for chartered accountants, and is obligatory on candidates

for the voluntary examination recently instituted by the Institute of

Bankers.

At the universities it receives an insufficient recognition in the degree

courses, but as its position varies a great deal a brief summary of the

usages of the various universities with regard to it may be given.

Degrees are granted in England by the five Universities of Oxford, Cam-

bridge, Durham, London, and Victoria ; in Scotland by the Universities

of Edinburgh, Glasgow,  Aberdeen,  and  St.  Andrews                                   in Ireland  by
                                                                                    ;

Trinity College and the Royal University of Ireland.

                                                     ENGLAND.

     At Oxford it is an optional subject, which may be taken up as one of
the three selected subjects for the pass B.A. degree. As studied for this
examination it is mainly elementary and largely theoretical, many of the
questions relating to certain prescribed portions of the works of Adam Smith
and Walker. To pass this examination, for which the yearly number
of candidates presents an average of two hundred, demands common

sense and a fair general acquaintance with leading economic topics.

A paper on Economics is included among those set in the Honour School

of Modern History.
     At Cambridge the position occupied by Economics in the university

curricula is far more satisfactory. In some shape or other it forms part

of three degree examinations. All candidates for the ordinaiy pass B.A.,

after passing the general examination, have to take up a special subject
for their concluding study. Of these, sixteen in all, there ai'e seven Arts
special subjects, one of which is Economics. The special examination in

Economics (Political Economy) consists of two 2:)arts, which may be taken

at separate times :

   --Part I.^ Three papers.

         Two in General Economic Theory.
          One in Economic History.

   --Part II. Three papers.

         Two in Taxation and Economic Functions of Government, with

                   History of Trade and Finance, 1760-1860.

         One in General Theory of Law and Government.

     In the Moral Science Tripos (Honour B.A.) there are six obliga-
tory papers, two being assigned to Political Economy, while in addition
advanced Political Economy ranks as one of the specified subjects, two
of which must be passed in by a candidate desirous of being classed.
Lastly, in the Historical Tripos (Honour B.A.), one paper is in Economic
History, the paper on general History of England also being supposed
to require some economic knowledge. Further, candidates who desire it

may take Political Economy and Theory of Government with International
Law as an alternative to the study of a second special subject. Of these

three examinations, those which seem most satisfactory, so far as Econo-
mics is concerned, are the special for the pass B.A., which embraces
at once the four important branches of administrative, theoretical, his-
ON ECONOMIC TKAINIXG IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 389

torical, and financial Economics, and the Moral Science Tripos so far as
that part is concerned which affects students taking up advanced Econo-

mics.

     In the XIniversitrj of Durham, in addition to the obligatory subjects,
two optional subjects have to be chosen by candidates for the degree.
These are selected out of a number of subjects, of which Economics is
one. The knowledge required is not of an advanced nature.

     In the University of London Economics holds no position but the
somewhat unfortunate one of a subject for candidates proceeding from
the B.A. to the M.A. degree in Moral Science, a position which at once
restricts the number of students likely to study it, and prevents its
study from extending much beyond the knowledge of general theory.
It is not a subject, either optional or obligatory, at any other examina-

tion.

     In the Victoria University Economics, comprising Political Economy
and Economic History, forms one of the twelve optional subjects, of
which two have to be selected for the final year of study by candidates
for the pass B.A. degree, the two other subjects being more or less
restricted. Economic Theory or History may also be taken in con-
junction with Modern History as one subject by candidates who wish,
for instance, to take Modern History but not Ancient History. As,

however, nearly all the other subjects are, with some difference of

standard or period, subjects at the intermediate or second-year ex-
amination, in some instances compulsory, and again in certain cases

subjects at the final examination, the study of Economics, involving as it

does the entry of tlie student upon a wholly new subject during his

final year, is naturally discouraged. Further, Economic Theory (Political

Economy), like any other Arts or Science subject, may, by permission, be

substituted for one of tlie two selected general subjects, Ethics or Modern

AHistory, at the intermediate stage of the Law degree (LL.B.).  course

of lectures in Political Economy has to be attended by candidates for

the Honours degree in History. It is not a subject in the examination.

                                                    SCOTLAND.

    By the regulations of the Commission applicable to all Scotch Univer-

sities, Economics holds a twofold position.

     (a) With regard to the ordinary M.A. examination, it is one of the
three optional subjects which have to be selected out of the usual Arts and
Science subjects. In all, seven subjects must be taken, but of these four
are more or less prescribed. The course which must be attended consists

of at least 100 lectures.
     (6) It is further a compulsory subject for the first examination for the

Agricultural B.Sc. In this case the knowledge required is much, slighter,

and naturally much more closely i-elated to rural economy.

                                                       IRELAND.

    At Trinity College Economics is part of one of the seven groups in
which the Honour degree may be taken, the other subjects in this group
being History and Law. All candidates for the Law degree must be

graduates in Arts, but not necessarily graduates in Honours, or if in
390 REFORT-- 1894.

Honours, in this particular group. It is also included among the options

for the pass degree.

     In the Royal University of Ireland Economics (Political Economy) is
an alternative with Ethics in one of the three groups, one of wliich must
be passed by candidates for the ordinary pass B.A. In the examinations
for the Honour degree (B.A.) it, with Civil and Constitutional History
and General Jurisprudence, constitutes one of the six groups open to the
student. It holds a very similar position in the examination for the M. A.

degree.

The foregoing account shows clearly how little opportunity is given

for the systematic study of Economics as a preliminary to degree examina-

tion, and especially in the case of Honours. It is certainly very unfortunate

that an able student anxious to graduate in Honours is almost precluded

from devoting a large amount of attention to the study of Economics.

     In face of this tacit discouragement, so far as examinations are con-

cerned, the provision for teaching made in many places by colleges and
universities is almost a matter for surprise. At both Cambridge and

Oxford it is satisfactory in all but one respect. It is varied and comprehen-

-- --sive, but and this is a matter of regret it is not sufficiently systematic.

At each of these universities there is a professor engaged in active teaching,

while other lecture courses are provided by college lecturers. At the

universities and colleges in the rest of England the provision for teaching

is of necessity less complete. At those best equipped, instruction in

Economics depends on the energy and vigour of a single teacher, supple-

mented, perhaps, by an occasional course of lectures by some other

economist ; while at the rest, if taught at all, it is attached to the
duties of a teacher principally engaged in, and probably principally in-

terested ill, teaching some other subject, fur, as a general rule, the teaching

of Economics in conjunction with some other subject has meant little more

than that the teacher of some other subject has had to give a course of

lectures on General Economics. At two of the three colleges of the

--Victoria University Economics has separate teachers at Liverpool one

holding the rank of professor, at Manchester one holding that of a

lecturer. At Leeds, on the other hand, there is no teacher of Economics.

At the other university colleges in England the two London colleges

possess each a professor, though the professor at King's College delivers

Economic lectures only during the six winter months. At the University

College, Nottingham, Economic lectures are delivered by a professor at

the same time engaged in teaching history and literature. The other

colleges (Birmingham, Bristol, Sheffield, and Newcastle) at present make

no provision for teaching a subject which they tind so discounted as a

subject for examination.

In "Wales two of the University Colleges (Aberystwith and Cardiflf)

have made some sort of provision for Economic teaching by the appoint-

ment  of  lecturers  in  History  and  Political  Economy                                               while  at  Bangor
                                                                                                     ;

Economics is tacked on to the duties of the Professor of Moral

Philosophy.

In Scotland there is a fully instituted chair of Political Economy at

the University of Edinburgh, and measures are in progress for the endow-

ment of a Professorship at Glasgow, where the Economic work has recently

been performed by a lecturer acting as assistant to the Professor of Moral
           ON ECONOMIC TKAINIKG IN THIS AND OTHER COUNTRJES. 391

Philosophy. At St. Andrews a yearly course of lectures is delivered by

the Professor of Moral Philosophy.
      In Ireland, at Trinity College, Dublin, there is a Professorship of

Economics. At the Queen's Colleges of Belfast, Cork, and Galway this

teaching is combined with that of Jurisprudence, and limited to a very

short portion of the year.

     Owing to the great differences existing between the courses delivered
at the various institutions, and the entirely diverse character of the
respective audiences, it is impossible to give any satisfactory statistics of
attendance. From most quarters come complaints. Indeed, with the
two possible exceptions of Oxford and Cambridge, it is difficult to imagine
a more complete indifference to the scientific study of Economics than that

displayed at the present time.

      In addition to lectui'es, more informal instruction is often imparted to
more advanced students, but the formation of a seminar in Economics has
been undertaken but seldom, if at all. That this is due not to lack of
will on the part of the teachers in those colleges where Economic teach-
ing is entrusted to a separate teacher, but mainly to the singular deficiency
in advanced or even moderately advanced students, is shown by the
readiness with which individual instruction, often involving much sacrifice
of time, is given to such students when they do present themselves. Such
an institution can be successfully introduced only when Economic studies
are so i-ecognised as to be able to attract the abler students in a university

or college.

     Attempts to develop popular Economic instruction by means of even-
ing classes, and separate courses of lectures, have been made by the
university colleges and other institutions, and by the Societies for the
Extension of University Teaching ; and at some of the former particular
attention has been paid to the Economic teaching, noticeably at Owens
College, Manchester, and University College, Liverpool. The class of

students attracted to these lectures may be spoken of very favourably.
From the reports and information supplied by the Societies, it would
seem that though the attendance at Economic courses, when given, is
good, the demand for them is not very great. The interest shown in the

--subject in some one or other of its branches is said to be reviving cer-

tainly to be greater than it was some few years ago. There has been a
decided increase in the demand for lectures on Economics, and subjects
partially economic, during the last two years.

     Economic studies in England require at the present time organisation

and encouragement. As to the ability of English Economists and the
quality of their contributions there can be no doubt ; but, when compared
with Continental countries, England is sadly lacking in the number of
Economic students. Where they have many, she has few. As has been

said, this is largely due to the unfortunate position to which Economics

has been relegated in many universities, and its neglect so far as profes-
sional callings are concerned. On the other hand, the revival of interest
in Economic matters, so abundantly manifested, makes it exceedingly
desirable to provide means and opportunities for sound scientific training.

The determination of the quality of steam, or its wetness, has come to be

of very great importance both in boiler trials and engine trials. It was
in the classical researches of G. A. Hirn at Logelbach in Alsace in

1854-57, and in subsequent experiments by MM. Grostete, Hallauer, and

Leloutre, and other members of the Societe Industrielle of Mulhouse,

that the great importance of the action of water in the steam-engine

cylinder was fii-st clearly recognised. It was perceived that the water

present in the cylinder, and which may amount to 50 per cent, of the

steam introduced, was due to three distinct causes : (a) initial wetness

of the steam (b) condensation in the mass of steam due to adiabatic
                                                                ;

Anexpansion (c) the action of the cylinder wall.  accurate discussion of
       ;

the results of an engine test is impossible if the initial condition of the

steam is unknown, both because the total heat per pound of steam

received by the engine depends on its dryness, and because water

introduced with the steam increases the prejudicial action of the cylinder

wall.

     In boiler tests the evaporative efficiency is measured in pounds of
water converted into steam per pound of coal. But if part of the feed

water supplied leaves the boiler as water entrained in the steam, the real
evaporation is less than the apparent evaporation. The entrained water

must be allowed for in estimating the evaporative efficiency of the boiler.
Further, a boiler which supplies wet steam is a bad boiler, because wet

steam is prejudicial to the efficiency of the engine, and it should be one

object of a boiler trial to determine whether the steam is of good quality.
     The earliest attempts to detenuine the amount of moisture in steam

which have come to our knowledge were made during some boiler trials

by a committee of the Societe Industrielle of Mulhouse.' This committee

--tried three methods : 1. A Method of Separation. The whole of the steam

was taken through a spare boiler, without fire, in the expectation that the

moisture would be deposited. The increase of water in the spare boiler
during a trial was measured, and that part of the increase due to con-

densation by radiation was determined by a special experiment. A2.

--Condensing Method suggested by Him. Some of the steam from a boiler

under trial was condensed and its total heat determined. By comparing

the total heat per pound with that of dry saturated steam the amount of

--moisture was ascertained. 3. A Chemical Method. Salt was introduced

into the boiler, and the diminution of saltness of the boiler water during
a test determined. It was assumed that moisture in the steam would be
of the same saltness as the boiler water, and therefore the amount of salt
removed measured the wetness of the steam. In these early trials only
the second method appeared to give reasonable results. But the com-
mittee did not place full reliance on any of the methods tried.

  --Origin of the Water Suspended or Entrained in Steam. There are

three sources of the water found in steam :

       ON METHODS OF DETEllMINING THE DRYNESS OK STEAM. 393

    (1) By ebullition boiler water is projected into the steam space. Part
falls back, but part is carried on in the steam current. The extent to

which wetness may be thus produced depends on the activity of the

ebullition, the area of the water surface, the volume of the steam space,

the position of the steam valve, the density of the steam, and other

circumstances. In certain conditions of the boiler water, it foams, and

the steam space is filled with vesicles. Under such circumstances the

meclianically produced priming may be excessively severe.

As to priming of this kind some observations of Mr. Thornycroft on

Hea boiler with glass ends are very instructive.'         states that 'waters

which cause priming on boiling produce foam, consisting of a mass of

bubbles of various sizes. Water which is very bad produces bubbles so

durable as to remain a considerable time without breaking, and by them

the steam space of a boiler may be entirely filled. So soon as this takes

place, instead of simply steam leaving the boiler, the discharge consists of
foam, which is broken up in its rapid passage through the steam pipe.'

With pure water, steam retains no film of liquid for sufficient time to be

seen.

     (2) The steam in the boiler is subject to variations of pressure.
Bubbles formed under water rise to a region of less pressure. Fluctua-
tions of pressure arise from the intermittent demand for steam. During
expansions water must be formed as mist throughout the mass of the

steam. It is difficult, however, to suppose that any great quantity of

moisture is thus produced.

     (3) The steam in the steam space of the boiler, and when flowing
through the steam pipes, loses heat by radiation from the boiler roof and

the surfaces of the pipes. To this must correspond condensation of part
of the steam. Probably in some cases very considerable amounts of

moisture are produced in this way.

  --Methods of Determining the Wetness of Steam. Very difi'erent methods

have been tried by different observers to determine the amount of moisture
in steam. Some method is required sufficiently accurate for practical
purposes, and not involving excessively delicate measurements or com-
plicated apparatus. It is proposed to describe all the methods which
have been tried which seem at all likely to be useful, and finally to give
the results of some comparative trials made for the committee which

throw light on their relative trustworthiness.
--AI. Weighing Method.
                        method of direct weighing of a known

volume of a sample of steam has been proposed by Guzzi ^ and Knight.-*

A copper globe is used as a measuring vessel, which is placed in a receiver

connected with the boiler or steam pipe. After filling, it is taken out and

Vweighed. Let be the volume of the globe, w the weight of wet steam

in it. Let {\--x)w be the moisture and xw the steam in the globe, and

let V be the volume in cubic feet per pound of dry steam in the same

conditions of pressure and temperature. Then

                                V

              x=V /vw

The method is one obviously of excessive difficulty.

394 REPORT-- 1894.

  --II. Separating Method. Attempts have been made to ascertain the

amount of moisture in steam by measuring the quantity of water trapped
in a separator, between the boiler and engine, through which the whole of

the steam passed. Probably such separators are too small relatively to the
amount of steam flowing through them to detain the whole of the moisture.
Mr. G. A. Barrus, in using a small separator in connection with a super-

heating calorimeter, noticed that very nearly the whole of the moisture
was caught by the separator. In that case the quantity of steam passing

through the separator is small.' More recently Professor Carpenter, of

Cornell University, has brought out a form of separating calorimeter of
small size which can bo applied almost anywhere on a steam pipe or boiler,

and which can be used with very great facility.

     The separating calorimeter (tig. 1) consists of a vessel. A, about

12 in. x3 in., consisting of an inner chamber and a jacket. The steam

from the steam pipe, S, passes first into the inner chamber, where the

moisture is separated, and thence into the outer chamber. The separating

chamber is consequently almost perfectly protected from radiation. As

the water accumulates in the inner chamber its level is shown by a gauge

Aglass, g, and the amount can be read off on a scale.  very small orifice

at the bottom of the outer chamber regulates the amount of steam dis-

charged. The steam as it escapes passes through a flexible tube to a

simple form of condenser, C. The increase of weight of the condenser in

any given interval of time is noted, and the amount of water deposited in

the same time in the separator. If x is the dryness fraction of the steam,

IV the weight of water caught in the separator, and AV the weight of steam

condensed,

            x= ^^
                  W-i-w

     The scale on the separator is graduated to ^J, ^ths of a pound. There
is also a gauge glass and scale on the condenser, graduated to read pounds
and tenths at a temperature of 110° F. But as the variation of volume

of the water with temperature affects the readings considerably, it is best
to weigh the condenser, or, at any rate, to determine a correction of the

scale for temperature. Professor Carpenter states that the dryness of the

steam after passing the separator was tested in the laboratories of Sibley
College by several observers, and with steam carrying from \ per cent, to
60 per cent, of moisture. In every case the separation of the water from
the steam was complete and perfect.* Other tests have been made with
moderately dry steam, using the sepai'ating and throttling calorimeter
simultaneously, and the results were practically identical. The instrument
is very simple to use, and requires no pressure gauges or thermometers.

   --III. Condensing Method. Suppose a known weight of the steam con-

densed and its total heat determined. By comparing this with the total

heat of an equal weight of dry saturated steam, according to Regnault's
Tables, the amount of moisture in the steam can be determined.

     The apparatus designed and used by Hirn in the Mulhouse trials in
18-59 (fig. 2) is, so far as we know, the most convenient and perfect
apparatus hitherto used in trials of this method. It consists of an iron

vessel, C, about one foot in diameter, furnished with a loose cover. This

To arrive at satisfactory results the temperatures must be read to ^V degree

at least, and the weight of steam condensed determined very accurately.

Further, it is desirable that the temperature i should be about as much

below the temperature of the place where the test is made as the tempera-

/ Ature is above it.  correction is easily made for the small fall of

temperature by radiation during the time the agitator is used to secure

uniformity of temperature. Suppose the agitator is used for two minutes,

and the temperature/ then noted. The temperature is again noted two

minutes later. The small observed fall is the loss in the interval by

radiation, and is added to the observed temperature /as a correction. In

the Mulhouse experiments the initial and final temperatures of the con-

denser were generally about 60° and 110° F. The following table gives

the results of the Mulhouse tests in 1859. They wore made very carefully,

Himand  himself directed the tests.

The committee at Mulhouse, in discussing the.se results, point out

their variability, and remark that a mean of numerous observations

should be taken. This is probably true when the test is made on a

small scale. In Mr. Willans's tests one hundredweight of steam was

condensed in each test, and this gives what is virtually a mean of

numerous smaller tests. In the case of Trial 23, the Mulhouse Committee

thought that the calorimeter underestimated the amount of priming

water.

     About 1860, Joule used a calorimeter veiy similar to the above, in
order to determine the total heat of steam and verify Regnault's results.
The paper describing the experiments ' is interesting as showing that
fairly accurate results can be obtained by this method, used on a small
scale, when the observer is sufficiently skilful. The amount of steam
condensed was only from 8,700 to 14,100 grains in each test. Tem-
peratures were read to three decimal places. The weight of water in the
condenser was about 140,000 grains. The steam flowed into the con-

denser for two minutes. The steam must have been almost perfectly dry,

as the following (mean) results show :

condensed in the barrel, till the temperature has risen to about 110° F.
The valve is shut, the movable pipe removed, the water stirred, and the
barrel again weighed and its temperature taken. It is obvious that the
proceeding is a very rough one. Losses of heat by radiation, &c., tend to

make the observed total heat too small, and therefore the moisture in the
steam too large. On the other hand, evaporation from the barrel tends
to make an error of the opposite kind. It is known that in using this
method in a rough way negative results are sometimes obtained.

    Mr. P. W. Willans used this method also to determine the wetness

of the steam in his engine trials.' Mr. Willans used a very large con-

                                                                    FiG. 3.

densing tank weighing full about 3 tons, and placed on the platform of
a weighing machine. The tank was first balanced so that the weighing
machine lever just rose. Then a standard hundredweight was placed on
the platform of the machine, and the poise adjusted so that the lever
again just rose. The hundredweight was then removed, the temperature
of the condenser was noted, and steam condensed in the tank till the
lever rose (making an electric signal). The steam at that moment was

turned off, and the tank contained exactly one hundredweight of con-

densed steam. The condensing water was then stirred and the tem-

perature taken. The thermometers were sensitive (1° C. corresponded to

1 in. in some of them), and they were carefully compared with standai'd

Athermometers.  very small radiation correction was made. The ^-alue

of the dryness fraction found on different days was ·9996, '9638, -9949,

·9646, -9976, -9893, 1^0072, 1^0048, -9987. The mean of all is 0^991 1,
showing an average of about 1 per cent, of moisture in the steam. In

spite of the large scale on which the experiment was tried and the care

taken, the results are rather discrepant, and two of them give values

--which it would seem must be erroneous.
     IV. Continuous Condensing Method.- -The difficulties of the ordinary

condensing method have led Mr. Barrus, Mr. Hoadley, and other ob-

servers to adopt a process of continuous steady condensation. The steam

may be condensed (a) in the condensing water, or (^) in a surface con-
denser. The first method ' may be carried out by the apparatus shown

in fig. 3. Steam passes from the steam pipe, S, to a small injector, /.

The condensing water is drawn from the tank A, and the mixed water

and condensed steam are discharged into the tank B. If W, is the

A Wodecrease of weight of in any interval, and  the increase of weight

w=W2of B, then  -- W, is the weight of steam condensed. Thermo-

meters t, t, give the temperatures of the water entering, and mixed steam

and water leaving the injector. Let <,, t^ be these temperatures, and t

the temperature of the steam. Then, if x is the dryness fraction,

     Mr. Barrus has used a surface condenser (fig. 4), consisting merely of a
short vertical pipe in a vessel through which cooling water circulates. The
condenser is supplied with cooling water at a fixed rate of flow. Then, as
the condensing surface is constant, the rate of condensation is constant,
and the rise of temperature of the cooling water is constant. Condensation
is carried on for any convenient period, and the condensed steam run off'
for weighing. Simultaneously a series of readings are taken of the
temperature of the water entering and lea\'ing the condenser, and of the
condensed steam. The radiation correction can be determined by observing

the fall of temperature in the condenser when the supply of steam and
cooling water is stopped.^ The continuous condensing method seems likely
to be more accurate than the ordinary method, but the arrangements ai^e
more complicated.

   --V. Method by Superheating. Mr. G. H. Barrus about 1890 devised a

calorimeter in which the steam to be tested passed through a chamber
jacketed with superheated steam. The steam was thus dried and super-

     heated. The quantity of heat required was inferred from the fall of tem-
     perature of the superheated steam. The orifices of the inner steam pipe
     and outer jacket were equal, so that the same weight of steam passed
     tln-ough each. Hence no weighing was necessary. If t^ t^ are the tem-
     peratures of the superheated steam entering and leaving the jacket, and ^^ ^4

      then the superheated steam in the jacket has lost t^--t.2 degrees of tem-

     VI. The Wire-draiving Metliod. This was first proposed by Professor
Peabody. Mr. Barrus and others have devised modified forms of the
apparatus. It depends on the principle that slightly moist steam is super-
heated by -wire drawing. Fig. 5 shows Mr. Barrus's arrangement · of the

Aapparatus. The steam passes from a chamber to a chamber B through a

very small aperture {-^ inch in diameter). The full steam pressure is in

BA, and the pressure in differs little from atmospheric pressure. Ther-

    No weighing is required, and temperatures only have to be observed.

The apparatus must be in operation for twenty to thirty minutes before

observations are commenced. Then observations may be begun and con-

tinued for as long a period as is desired. It is not a mere small sample
of steam, therefore, which is observed, but a considerable quantity taken
from the steam pipe at a uniform rate. The observations are as simple as
possible, and the apparatus is used with the greatest facility. Presently
some tests will be given tending to show that the instrument is very

trustworthy.

This may be termed the normal temperature in the chamber B for dry

steam. In proportion as the temperature falls below this the steam is

initially moist. If it contains initially more than a certain amount of
moisture, the temperature in the chamber falls to 214° or below it, and
no calculation of the dryness is possible.

instrument can safely be used, there being then 6° of superheating in B,

  --YII. Combined Sejmrating and Wire-drawing Method. To extend

the usefulness of the wire-drawing method Mr. Barrus added a separator
(C, fig. 5). The steam first passes through the separator, leaving most of
its moisture, and the remainder is measured by a wire-drawing calorimeter.

When thus arranged the use of the instrument is much more complicated,

as the amount of steam flowing through and the amount of moisture

                                                                                                                 nn2
40-i REPORT-- 1894.

Aseparated must be weiglied.  condenser must therefore be used, at any

rate occasionally, to determine the amount of steam flowing in a given

time. Assuming the orifice to remain unchanged, a formula can be found

for the weight of steam discharged per minute at any given pressure.

                                             method has been pi"o-

posed by Mr. W. R. Cummins,' in which a vessel of constant volume is

used, completely surrounded by a steam jacket. Steam is at first blown

through both jacket and vessel till there is a fair sample of the steam to

be tested in both. Kext the jacket and vessel are cut off from the steam

pipe and from each other. The steam in the jacket is then heated by

compression (by a steam compressing pump) or by heating. The simul-

taneous rise of pressure and temperature in the vessel containing the

   --IX. Chemical Methods. These suppose that some soluble salt is added

to the boiler water so as to form a solution of known strength, and that of
all the feed supplied to the boiler part is evaporated and flows away as
steam, part as priming water. The former removes no salt ; the latter is

of the saltness of the water then in the boiler. Hence, either the decrease
of saltness of the boiler water or the amount of salt present in the steam
can be used in determining the amount of priming water in the steam.
Most commonly table salt (NaCl) has been used because the amount in
solution can be easily determined by the nitrate of silver method. In
other cases sulphate of soda has been used, the sulphuric acid being
tJetermined by precipitating with chloride of barium. It is convenient to

describe three variations in the way in which the chemical method is

applied.

   --(a) Decrease of Saltness of the Boiler Water -measured. Salt is intro-

duced -svith the feed till the boiler water contains 1 or 1^ per cent, of salt.
Then, during a test in which the amount of feed is measured, a sample of
the boiler water is drawn off at the beginning and end of the test. Care
must be taken that the level of the water in the boiler (as shown by the

gauge glass) is exactly the same when the two samples are taken. Let
'W be the weight of water in the boiler, and s, S2 the percentage of salt in
the two samples. The amount of salt removed from the boiler during

the dryness fraction of the steam. Then xiv lb. of pure steam are

The method deals with the whole amount of steam produced, and not

with mere samples of it. On the other hand, the disadvantages of the

method are : (1) It measures only priming water mechanically projected
into and carried by the steam, and not moistness produced in other ways.
(2) Great exactness of analysis is necessary, tlie difference of saltness
being a small quantity. (3) The feed, being continuously supplied at one
part of the boiler, tends to produce, in spite of the circulation, a non-
uniform distribution of saltness throughout the mass of water in the

boiler. If the saltness is not uniform, the difference of saltness of the
samples gives a quite erroneous result. If there is salt in the feed water,

it can be allowed for. This method was first used at Mulhouse in 1859 ;
much later it was revived, and is often called Brauer's method.

   --(/3) Percentage of Salt in the Steam determined. At intervals during

a test, samples of the boiler water are taken, and at the same time some
steam is condensed in a small surface condenser. Equal quantities of the
water samples are mixed together, and also equal quantities of the con-
densed steam. Let s, be the percentage of salt in the averaged sample
of boiler water, and Sj that in the averaged sample of condensed steam.
If a; is the dryness fraction of the steam, each pound contains x lb. of

steam and l--x lb. of water of the saltness of the boiler water.

                                        x=l-

The disadvantages of this method are (1) that very small portions of the
 steam are tested, and, as the mechanical action producing priming is
 probably irregular, it is very uncertain whether they fairly represent the
 average condition of the steam ; (2) the accurate determination of s, can
 only be made if the boiler water is uniformly salt ; (3) the amount of salt
 in the steam is very small compared with that in the boiler water, so that

--the accurate determination of s, is difficult.
     (y) Fschei-'s Method. A quite different method of considerable interest

 has been proposed by Mr. R. Escher, of Zurich. · Mr. Escher considered
 the case of a boiler fed with impure water. Of the salts in solution
 some are thrown down as incrustation, others remain in solution. In
 the boiler water during working there is a steady concentration of these

 soluble salts, which tends towards a fixed limit. At this limit the priming
 removes as much salt in the form of concentrated boiler water as the feed

 brings iu.

       Let s be the saltness of the feed water in pounds per pound of water,
 and k, the saltness at any given time of the boiler water. Then each

                                                      » Civilingenieur, 1879, p. 51.

--pound of steam removes (l x) k lb. of salt, while each pound of feed

introduces s lb. of salt. In steady working when the limit is reached

     Let kls=c, the ratio of concentration of the boiler water. Then, for

example, if the boiler water contains twenty times as much salt as the

feed, x=l --^^j=0·95, or the steam contains 5 per cent, of priming water.

The method assumes that the feed contains a definite percentage of easily

soluble salt, and that the trial has continued till the maximum concentra-

tion is reached.

  WBut if the boiler is freshly filled it may be a long time before the

limiting condition is reached. Let be the quantity of water in the

boiler in pounds, and F the quantity of feed per unit of time. Let k be

now the saltness of the boiler water at t from the beginning of the test.

In a short interval, dt, the quantity of salt Fndt enters the boiler with
the feed, and the quantity 'F{l--x)kdt is carried away in the priming
water. The increase of salt in the boiler is therefore

    From this equation, c being ascertained by analysis of the boiler
water, x can be determined at any period of the test. As the equation is
not easily solved x may be approximated to thus. If c is the concentra-

tion after t hours' working, a first approximation to x is

Mr. Escher has not directly suggested how his method could be used

in the case of a boiler fed with pure feed water, or, say, with water con-

taining too small an amount of chloride to give a sufficiently rapid

concentration. But it might easily be applied by pumping in with the

feed, at intervals of an hour, a known quantity, w, of a saturated salt

wsolution. The quantity might be so arranged that the concentration

at the end of the test was such that the boiler water contained about
A1 per cent, of salt.
                       preliminary assumption as to the amount of

priming would have to be made in settling what quantity of salt to

introduce.

     The salt method by measuring the decrease of saltness of the boiler
·water was first used at Mulhouse in 1859. In the trials then it failed to
«ive satisfactory results. In some of the tests an apparent increase of
saltness of the boiler water was found, which must have been due to the

saltness being ununiformly distributed in the boiler. At Diisseldorf in

1880 the method of measuring the salt in the steam was tried, sulphate
of soda being used.' Ten samples of boiler water and condensed steam
were taken in each test. The results were discrepant, giving 0-21 to

9 per cent, of moisture in the steam in difierent tests.

   --Use of the Salt Method in the Berlin Trials of Portable Engines in

]^883. The most careful tests by the salt method which have been found

are some made by Dr. Bunte in Munich, in some trials of portable engines
under the direction of a commission appointed by the German Govern-
ment. ^ In these tests both the decrease of saltness of the boiler water
and the amount of salt in samples of condensed steam were determined.
They throw some light, therefore, on the relative trustworthiness of the

two proceedings.
     Concentrated salt solution was introduced into the boilers before

beginning a test till the boiler water contained 1 to 1^ per cent, of salt.

At the beginning of each trial, and with the water at normal level in the

gauge glass, a sample of boiler water was taken ; at some intermediate
times, and at the end of the trial, similar samples were taken. The
boiler water was taken from a gauge cock. To prevent evaporation in
taking the sample it was drawn off through an india-rubber tube into a
vessel containing 500 c.c. of cold distilled water. Exactly 500 c.c. of
boiler water were drawn off, so that the sample had half the saltness of

the boiler water. The chlorine was determined by a nitrate of silver

solution containing 10 per cent, of normal solution, with the addition of
«hromate solution as an indicator. For the steam samples the steam was

taken from a cylinder or valve-chest cock. From 200 to 1,000 grams

·were condensed at intervals of about an hour.
      In Trial I., on the Dolberg Portable, the boiler-water samples showed

the same saltness at the beginning and end of the test. Intermediate
 samples showed very slight variations, attributed by Dr. Bunte to varia-
 tions of water level in the boiler. In five samples of condensed steam

an addition of 0'2 to 0'3 c.c. of silver solution gave a colour reaction..

Dr. Bunte calculates that the priming must have been less than 01 per
cent. Both methods, therefore, showed that there was practically no

priming. Identically similar results were obtained in trials of four other
boilers. But in one trial there was considerable priming. In Trial IV.,
on Siegel's Portable, the sample of boiler water taken at the beginning
showed 199 c.c. of 10 per cent, of normal salt solution, and that at the
end 191 c.c. per 100 c.c. This corresponds to a loss of 4 per cent, of the
salt in the boiler, or to 1'7 per cent, of priming. In the steam tests
different samples yielded 24-3, 20-3, 6-8, 4-0, 0-3, 0-2, 0-3, 25-5, and 7-3 c.c.
of 10 percent, of normal salt solution per 100 c.c. of condensed steam.
After thoroughly cleansing the apparatus by blowing through, 2,000 grams
of steam were condensed, and gave 9 c.c. per 100 c.c. The amount of salt
in the steam was therefore extraordinarily variable. The highest result,
25'5 c.c. per 100 c.c, corresponds to 12"8 per cent, of priming. Dr. Bunte
thinks that foaming occurred.

      It will be seen that in most cases the salt test fails to indicate any
appreciable priming. It must be inferred that the mechanical mixture of
boiler water with the steam is ordinarily an action of insignificant im-
portance. In one trial where there was great priming, shown by the
working of the engine as well as by the salt test, the results are extremely
discrepant, and apparently Dr. Bunte thinks that the real amount of
priming was greater than the salt tests indicate.

     The salt test was used in some tests of boilers at the Frankfort Exhi-
bition, in 1891, by a committee presided over by Dr. Schroter.' The tests
lasted eight days for each boiler. Salt was fed into the boiler till the
boiler water contained about 1^ per cent. After the boiler had been
working a day, two samples were taken, one of the boiler water from near
the evaporating surface, one from the nearest water separator in the
steam pipe. The samples were drawn off through a cooling coil to prevent
evaporation. The amount of salt in the samples was determined by the
nitrate of silver test, and also that in the feed supplied to the boilers.
The following table gives the results :

          ON METHODS OF DETERMINING THE DRYNESS OF STEAM. 409

the general result obtained when the salt test has been used is that in
ordinary cases there is very little moisture in the steam. Some trials
made lately by Professors Kennedy and TJnwin gave the same result.
On the other hand, some trials simultaneously with the salt method and

one of the other methods, such as the wire-drawing or separating method,
have given this result : that the moisture in the steam indicated by the
salt method was only about one- tenth as great as that shown by the
other methods, and that not in steam taken from a steam pipe at a
distance from the boiler, but in steam taken directly out of the boiler

itself.

      It is clear that the salt test can only indicate boiler water mechanically
mixed with the steam by ebullition, not moisture produced in other ways.
It might be expected, therefore, that the salt method would give a larger

dryness fraction than other methods. Whether the great difference is

entirely attributable to this cause, or in part to inherent difficulties in the
salt method, cannot at present be ascertained. It would rather seem that

the Escher method, which apparently has never been tried, would give
the best results, if used in a case where the trial extended over a week or

more.

    A subordinate question is this. Some engineers have thought that

the salt method was specially suitable for boiler trials because it gave
directly what may be called the mechanical priming, although other
methods were more suitable for engine trials where what is wanted is a
knowledge of the absolute quality of the steam. This view seems to be
 founded on a misapprehension. In determining the efficiency of a boiler
it is necessai-y to know how much of the feed leaves the boiler as steam
and how much as water. If, in steam taken directly from the boiler, there
is more moisture than corresponds to mechanical priming, that is as much
 a deduction from the evaporation of the boiler as if it were mechanical
 priming. The product of the boiler is so much wet steam, and the value
 of this steam depends on its dryness. The total heat utilised depends on
 the dryness. It is not at all important how the moisture came into the
 steam provided it is there. The only point to attend to in a boiler trial
 is that the steam tested should be taken directly from the boiler, and not

 from a steam pipe in which condensation due to radiation may have been

 going on. It is equally desirable that in an engine test the steam should
 be taken from the steam pipe very near to the engine.

   --Test of the Wire-drawing Calorimeter. The instrument tried was one

 received direct from Mr. Barrus. It seemed extremely desirable to get
 some kind of absolute test of the trustworthiness of this instrument, as it

 is much the simplest to use for nearly dry steam. Especially it seemed

 desirable to ascertain whether any correction for radiation or other loss of
 heat would be necessary. This can only be tested by using steam of

 known condition. The direction given in the instructions accompanying
 the instrument is to test it with the steam from a boiler not doing much
 work, the steam being then assumed to be dry saturated steam. But this

  is inconclusive.

       To test this instrument, a small superheater was constructed, heated
  by a row of gas jets. Then there is definitely superheated steam in both

     In the following experiment the pressure in the second chamber was

approximate, and the difference is less than that which may be due to

unavoidable inaccuracy in reading the i-)ressure gauge. Since in ordinary

use about 20° fall of the temperature ^_>' corresponds to 1 per cent, of
moisture in the steam, it appears that the calculated value of t^ for dry

steam is practically exact. Other experiments (though not over any great
range of pressures) have been made. So far as they have gone, they con-
firm this result. Hence it appears that no correction of the theoretical

calculation is necessary to obtain practical accuracy, and that the assump-

tion that all the kinetic energy at the orifice reappears as heat is prac-

tically true.

     In fig. 6 the temperature curves for the experiment above have been
plotted. The saturation temperature ^j, due to the steam pressure, calcu-

kind care accurate enough to prove that the specific heat varies. On the

other hand, Mr. Barrus has neglected to calculate the dryness fraction of
the steam, and so has missed the striking evidence these results afford to
the general accuracy of the instrument. The separator was not a very
perfect one, and allowed about 0-4 per cent, of moisture to pass. But the

separator results cannot be much wrong, for they are measured results
depending on no assumed constants. The error in calculating the 0-4 per
cent, passing the separator cannot be large enough to much affect the total
i-esult. On the other hand, the calculation from the heat gauge when the
separator was cut out, which depends on the assumed value 0-48 of the

specific heat and on the theory of the instrument, agrees strikingly viiih

the separator results.

  --Test of Wire-draioing and Sejmrating Calorimeter combined. The

following tests have been arranged to determine how far it is true, as

stated by Carpenter, that a separator traps the whole of the moisture,
even Avith very moist steam. The Barrus calorimeter was used with its
drip box or separator. The amount of water deposited in the drip box
was measured. Observations also were taken of the temperatures in the
two chambers of the wire-drawing part of the instrument. Let «,«o be
the temperatures in the first and second chambers of the wire-drawing
part, <3 the saturation temperature of steam in the second chamber

The dryness in each experiment has been calculated by this formula for
the steam passing from the drip box into the wire-drawing part.

the wire-drawing part would generally, for practical purposes, lead to an

error of no great importance, at any rate, when the steam had initially

more than 1 per cent, of moisture. Further, the separator on the Barrus

calorimeter is not quite so well arranged as that of the Carpenter calori-

meter. The steam leaving the latter is no doubt drier than that leaving

the separator of the Barrus calorimeter.

that there was a considerable flow of steam along the main steam pipe.

Two pairs of tests were made. In one the Carpenter calorimeter alone

was used, and the flow of steam along the 30-foot branch pipe was com-

paratively slow. In the other pair, steam was flowing through the Barrus

calorimeter also. As this uses twice as much steam as the Carpenter, the

rate of flow was about three times greater than in the first pair of tests.

villa, and fragments of hypocaust pipes, Samian ware, and light grey pre-

liistoric pottery, together with black pottery and Roman coins, have been

found.

     Through the Museum Committee of the Cardiff County Council casts

in plaster of two of the most remarkable of these crosses have been

secured. These casts have lately been placed in the Cardiff Museum as

a nucleus of a typical collection of casts of the ancient inscribed stones
and crosses of Glamorganshire.

     In addition, the whole of the known inscribed crosses, with two or
three exceptions, have been photographed by Mr. T. Mansell Franklen,

the Clerk of the Peace for Glamorganshire, and these are available for

 --III. The Etlin,ograi)hical Survey of Ireland. Report of tlw Committee

1. As in the previous year, the Committee have had the advantage of the
co-operation of several gentlemen not members of the Association, but
delegates of various learned bodies who are interested in the Survey.

They have to deplore the loss, by death, of one of these gentlemen, Mr.
H. S. Milman, director of the Society of Antiquaries, who had been
delegated by that Society and had rendered much assistance in the earlier
stages of the work. His place has been filled by the election by the same
Society of its Vice-President, Mr. Granville Leveson-Gower, of Titsey
Place, as a delegate to this Committee. His colleague, Mr. George Payne,
and Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. G. L. Gomme, and Mr. J. Jacobs, the rei^resenta-
tives of the Folk Lore Society, Sir C. M. Kennedy, K.C.M.G., representing
the Royal Statistical Society, Mr. Edward Laws, the Ven. Archdeacon

Thomas, Mr. S. W. Williams, and Professor John Rhys, representing the

Cambrian Archaeological Association, and Dr. C. R. Browne, a representa-
tive of the Royal Irish Academy, have continued their valuable services.
Some other members of the Committee are delegated by the Anthropological

Institute.

     2. In their first report the Committee presented a list of 2G-1 villages
or places which, in the opinion of competent persons consulted by the
Committee, appeared especially to deserve ethnographic study, and they
appended to the list observations furnished by their correspondents on the
special characteristics of such villages and places, which rendered them
typical. This considerable number does not exhaust the supply of names

                                                                                                                  EE2

of places, sevei-al more having been received since the first report was

prepared.

     3. In the first report it was stated tliat no villages had been suggested
in Northumberland. This omission has since been supplied by the kind-

ness of Mr. R. O. Heslop, who has furnished the following list :

   --North. Tweedmoiifh, Berwick (Romany influence in folk speech),

          Ford, Cornhill, Lowick, Wooler, Belford, Bamburgh, EinhJeton,

           Longbroughton, Almvick, Whittinc/liam, Warkivortli, EotJibiiry,

            Harbottle, Elsdon.

   --South. Morpeth, Wludton, Stamfordham, Ponteland.
  --Tyneside (co. of Durham). Blaydon, Winlaton Swalwill, Whickham,

           Low-Fell, Birtley, Usworth.

   --Northumberland. Newburn, JVeiccastle (keelmen's quarter), North

              Shields.

  --West Tyne. Wylarn, Hedley-on-the-Hill, Slaley, Blanchland, Cor-

         bridge, Hexham (a tinker and Irish quarter), Acomb, Humshagh,
         Birtley, Wark, Bellingham, Bardon Mil], Haydon Bridge, Whit-

                 field.

   --South- Westerx (mixture of lead-mining population). Allendale

          Town, AUenheads, Slaggyford, Haltwhistle.

     Mr. Heslop thinks that capable observers could be obtained at the

--places printed in italics, and has furnished the following summary of the

special features of the district :

  --Fishermen (self-contained and intermarried communities). Berwick,

         Spital, Holy Island, North. Sunderland, Newton, Boulmer, New-

         biggin, Cullercoats.                          Lemington,

 --rUots and Boatmen. North and South Shields.

--f Pitmen. Bachworth, Seghill, Acklington.
--\ Keelmen. Sandgate, (Newcastle), Dunston, Blaydon,

       Felling Shore (co. Durham).

The pitmen and keelmen of the Tyne are chiefly descended from

     the Border clans.

--Shepherds. Harbottle, Wooler, Head of Reedsdale. (Tlie Cheviot

men, of the wide district embracing tlie Cheviot range on the North-

umberland side, would have to be observed from these points.)

    4. Mr. E. W. Oox, of Bebington, has furnished the following list of

places in the neighbourhood of that part of Cheshire and Lancashire :

Norton, near Runcorn.

Mr. Cox describes these as quiet, primitive, and little altered rural

places, having strong characteristics of i-ace. For examjale, at Crosby

there is a dark, sallow, small tribe, of idle and listless habits, given to petty

thefts, full of supei'stitions, and difficult to train. Adjacent to these, at

North Meols, the flat district near Southport, is a large, stoutly built race

of light complexion and hair, fresh -coloured, honest, lethargic, good hus-

bandmen, with a Flemish or Dutch type of face and figure. Till the last

century, or the early part of this century, these folks were entirely local

and cut off from association with any considerable town or traffic ; they

have their own ways and customs, fast becoming obsolete.

     5. In the peninsula of Lleyn, the S.W. part of Carnarvonshire, Professor

--Anwyl has furnished the following additional names of places :

  --Aherdaron. The men of this village and neighbourhood, at the extreme

end of the peninsula, are known over the greater part of Wales as

'gwirioniaid Aberdaron,' or 'the fools of Aberdaron.' Many of them

still have probably never seen a railway train, and their acquaintance

Awith town life is very imperfect.  distinction must, however, be drawn

between the occupiers of the large and flourishing farms of the neighbour-

hood, such as Bodwrdda, Meillionydd, and the like, and the inhabitants of

the mud houses situated on the barren moorland known as Rhos Hirwaen,

in the central part of the far end of the peninsula. The inhabitants of

this extensive waste, dotted with occasional homesteads, are considered by

t!ie neighbourhood around to be inferior in inteUigence. However that

may be, their civilisation is at a distinctly lower level than that of the

people living on the main roads between the extreme end of the peninsula

and Pwllheli and Nevin. This is due largely to economical causes : the

land on which they live is very poor, and consequently they have not the

means of providing the adjuncts of civilisation. Professor Anwyl has

heard one family, whose members are scattered over this moorland, called

' teulu y Carthod,' but has not been able to discover why they were so

called. They are looked upon as the lowest in intelligence in the district.

One said to be a member of this family was of a rather swarthy com-

plexion, jjossessing in appearance a somewhat Mongolian cast of features.

The forehead was small and the hair dark. In visiting the Board school
of Llidiardau, to which the children of this district go. Professor Anwyl

was struck with what appeared to be a marked absence of faces of any

prettiness. On the top of a hill called Mynydd Bodwrdda, in the imme-
diate neighbourhood of tliis district, there are remains of earthworks. On

a farm called Penybont, at the end nearest Pwllheli of Rhos Hirwaen, is'

a very conspicuous monolith. The district of Aberdaron includes the

promontory of Braichypwll, on the coast over against Bardsey Island. On

a plot of ground facing the Eardsey sound there are remains of an old

church, generally connected with the ancient pilgrimages to Bardsey.
422 REPORT-- 1894.

Right on the edge of the sea, in the rock, there is a well of fresh water

called Ffynon Fair (Mary's Well), to which steps have been cut, and with

which doubtless some folk-lore is connected.

U'wclb y Myiiydd, almost at the extreme end of Lleyn. Here is a
Afarm called 'Y Gwyddel.'
                           mountain in the neighbourhood is called

A' Mynydd y Gwyddel.'  farm near is called ' Bodarnabwy,' most likely,

Gwernabwy.

     Penycaeraii, and HJiiiv, to the east of Aberdaron, on Cardigan Bay.

R.hiw is a somewhat isolated village or hamlet between Mynydd y P^hiw
and Mynydd y Graig. Mynydd y Graig dips into Porth Neigwl Bay,
sometimes called in Welsh Safn Uffern= Hell's Mouth.

Bodferin, to the N.W. of Aberdaron, on the St. George's Channel.

The church of this place has long since fallen into ruins, and the parish

been annexed to Llangwnadl. In the neighbourhood of one of the farms

near Rhydlios chapel, called Tyddyn Ffrainc, is a supposed medicinal

well. The water of another well in this district, called Ffynon Leuddad,

or Loewad, is still believed to cure warts. Pi'ofessor Anwyl suggests

that in studying the etlmology of Wales it would seem preferable, in

districts where there are no villages, to endeavour to observe the physical

characteristics of members of the various places of worship, which are

practically the centres of the different communities.

Llangwnadl and Bryncroes, parishes adjacent to Bodferin. Tlie district

around Bryncroes church is fairly well populated, and in all probability-

has been isolated. In mediaaval times there were some religious houses,

liere, indicated by the names Monachdy and Ty Fair. In Llangwnadl

parish are several families, the history of which can be traced for a con-

siderable time, and it may practically be taken for granted that families

which were settled in Lleyn early in the last century have been there from

time immemorial, road communication having been till then very imperfect

in the peninsula. In this neighbourhood there is a marked prevalence of

sandy hair and beard and bluish grey eyes. Aquiline noses of fair length

are very common, and the physique generally is good.

     Penllcch and Tydireiliog, adjoining parishes, are similar in chai'acter to

those last mentioned. On one of the fields belonging to Cefnamwlch

estate, in the neighbourhood of Tydweiliog, there is a well-preserved

cromlech called ' Coiten Arthur,' and there are apparently the remains of

another close by.

   Sam Feillteyrn, a village about two miles from the cromlech, in the

direction of Cardigan Bay, may repay inspection, but it is doubtful whether

any of the families which inhabit it have been long established there.

Llaniestyn, another village not far oft", in the direction of Garn Fadryn.
Edeyrn and Nevin, on the St. G eorge's Channel side of the peninsula.

The pojDulation of Nevin (where Edward I. held a tournament) is

largely sea-faring. The inhabitants have one or two marked peculiarities
=of dialect : for example, the use of ' mi olchon '
                                                     ' we washed,' where all

the other inhabitants of Lleyn would say 'mi ddarun olchi.' Inter-

marriage is common, and the population has tended to keep itself apart.

Near Porthdinllaen, on a promontory, there are remains of fortifications,

probably raised by Norsemen, who made descents upon the coast.

Nant Giuytheyrn and LlitJifaen, between Nevin and the EiH.

     Speaking generally of the districts of Lleyn, with which he is best

acquainted, Professor Anwyl remarks that a frequent term of abuse is ' Yr

Hen Wenhwyfar ' or ' Yi' Hen Andros.' Cebyst(r) is also used in this way.
Among the rocks of Creigiau Duon, in Penllech Bay, is a cave called ' Ogof

Huw bion Ychain,' who is thought to have lived in it. There is also on the

land of a holding called Tyn y Cae an ' Ogof Sian,' and there were stories
designed to frighten children said about it. 'Mor Gerwyn,' in the neigh-

bourhood of ' Berthaur ' farm, was popularly believed to have no bottom.

Children were told not to go near the river ' neu mi neith yr hen lemprog dy
=futa di '
              'or the old lamprey will eat thee.' It is believed that snake

bites can be cured by bandaging the finger with the skin of the snake or

the entrails of a newly killed fowl. The flowers of the foxglove are sup-

posed to cause sores upon the hands. Pieces of string placed in a certain
way on wells were supposed to be means of witchcraft. Ghosts are gene-

=rally described as being ' Olwyn mewn olwyn o dan ' ' a wheel within a

wheel of fire,' and not unfrequently as dragging chains after them. It is

considered impious by some to point to a rainbow. The mode employed

=for drawing lots is generally the method called ' tynu byra docyn ' ' to

draw the shortest ticket.' Strangers are generally pressed to keep on their
=liats while indoors. The ' offrwm '
=so also the ' wylnos '                ofl'ering, is still kept up at funerals,

                         vigil night.

G. The number of villages and places enumerated has thus been

increased to 367, and the Committee have every reason to be satisfied

--with the result of the first step they took. The second step that of

--settling the form of schedule- has occupied much time, especially the

portion of the form relating to physical observations, which differs to some

extent from that given in the first report. The Committee have to thank

Dr. Garson and Professor Haddon for the attention they have given to

this matter.

     7. The form of the schedule of physical types of the inhabitants as
now settled for England is given at the end of this report.

8. The other schedules have not been altered from the forms given in

the first report. Copies of the schedules have been sent to the corre-

.spondents of the Committee, and also to the secretaries of the correspond-

ing societies of the Association, to whom a circular has been addressed,
requesting that the schedules may be brought under the notice of the

council of each society, and containing the following observations :

   My' Committee venture to hope that your society and its members

will be willing to assist in their work, and I have to suggest for your

consideration whether that might not most conveniently be done by the

appointment of a sub-committee, consisting of persons each of whom

would be willing to undertake one of the heads of the investigation.

    ' I may draw your attention to the directions for measurement, by

which you will see that the absolutely essential instruments required for

Mythe physical measurements can be obtained for 11. 6s.  Committee

quite appreciate that they are asking your members for what may involve

the devotion of some time, and they are glad, therefore, that the cost in
money need not be very great.'

9. Sufficient time has not yet elapsed for obtaining answers from all

the corresponding societies, but several sub-committees have already been

formed or are in course of formation. The Malton Field Naturalists' and

Scientific Society has formed a sub-committee, of which Dr. Ernest

Colley is chairman. Miss Nina F. Layard, of Ipswich, has taken steps

towards the formation of a sub-committee for that district, and has

obtained the co-operation of Mr. G. Hetherington for the physical
--421 EEPORT 18J4.

observations, and Dr. Groome, of Stowmarket, for the folk-lore. The

Bristol and Gloucestershire Archfeological Society and the Cotteswold

Club have formed a joint local committee, of which Dr. Beddoe and
AMr. Sidney Hartland are members.
                                       research committee has been

appointed by the Cardiff Naturalists' Society, of which Mr. F. T. Howard,

of University College, Cardiff, is the secretary. The Northamptonshire

Natural History Society and Field Club is also taking steps in the same
direction. The societies in Manchester and Liverpool and the Glasgow

Arclueological Society will, it is hoped, also be able to organise sub-

Acommittees for the purpose.       sub-committee for Wales and another

for Ireland had been formed when the first report of the Committee was

presented.

10. The Sub-Committee for Ireland, consisting of representatives of

the Royal Irish Academy, has, indeed, already completed two memoirs,

which serve as excellent types of what this Committee aims at doing for
the United Kingdom at large. These memoirs have been read before
that Academy and published in its ' Proceedings,' and relate to the ethno-
graphy of the Aran Islands, by Professor A. C. Haddon, secretary of

the sub-committee, and  Dr.  C.    R.  Browne                              and the  ethnography of
                                                                        ;

Inishbofin and Inishshark, county Galway, by Dr. Browne. They have

been prepared in pursuance of a plan adopted by the Dublin Anthro-

pomorphic Committee of combining the ordinary work of the laboratory

with local investigation in selected parts of the country. The islands of

Inishbofin and Inishshark, with some small uninhabited islets, form the

parish of Inishbofin, and are situated outside of Killary Bay, and about

sixteen miles distant from Clifden, the nearest town of any size. The

climate is mild even in winter, but the islands are subject to heavy rains

and fierce storms, which often cut off communication with the mainland

for days. For his observation of the physical types of the people

Dr. Browne used the form of schedule adopted for Ireland by this

Committee, which slightly differs from that above given as adopted for

England. The instruments taken with him were Garson's anthropometer,

a sliding measure for the limbs, Broca's compas d'qjaisseur' and compas

glissiere, a Chesterman steel tape, a portable form of Cunningham cranio-

meter (made specially for field work by Messrs. Robinson, of Grafton

Street, Dublin), and a set of Snellen test-types for estimating keenness of

eyesight, the whole, with notebook and observation forms, fitted in a

canvas knapsack, weighing under ten pounds. He had some difficulty in

overcoming the repugnance of the people to be measured, observed, and

jihotographed, but succeeded in noting the eye and hair colours of 241

individuals and measuring 40 adult males, being about one-fifth of the

whole number in the islands. The average height of the men was

1,633  mm.,  or 5 feet 6^ inches,  slightly less than                      the  Irish mean stature
                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the women presented the similarity of appearance presumed to be due

to intermarriage of the same families through several generations. Sight

and hearing were very acute. In addition to the observations made on

the living subject, the measurements of a series of crania were obtained,

and some further measurements of crania secured by Professor Haddon

have also been communicated by him to the Academy. These were all

(as were the majority of the living subjects measured) mesaticephalic,

having a mean cephalic index of 77. The population of the islands,

though still dense, is steadily decreasing. In 1891 it consisted of 511
males and 486 females (a difference of 25, not 95, as mispi-inted in the
                                                                          ;

                                                                   large

proportion of the marriages are consanguineous, but no cases of malforma-

tion or congenital disease are ascribed to this. The sanitary state of the

houses is not by any means good. The people contrast strongly with the

Aran Islanders in their taste for music and dancing. The surnames to be

met with on the islands are fifty-one, of wliich Dr. Browne gives a list

the most largely distributed being 'Scuffle,' possibly a corruption of
Scholfield or Scovell, of which there are twenty-two families. The

majority are more or less Anglicised forms of old Irish names. Every

family combines fishing and farming, and has some share in a boat. As

is the case in many fishing communities, the fields are not well kept.

Kelp-burning, formerly one of the industries of the islands, is now prac-

tically extinct. The one tailor still adheres to the old method of measuring

his clients without a tape, using instead a sheet of paper, on which the

several lengths are recorded by notches cut with the scissors. The people

marry young, generally from purely family reasons, the match being

ari-ano-ed by the parents. Infants are carefully watched after birth, lest

Anthey should be changed.   old Irish dirge is sung at funerals. Alco-

holic liquors are not much drunk. The houses are, as a rule, built of dry

stones without any mortar, and consist of a kitchen, into which at night

the cattle, fowls, and pigs are taken, and one or two bedrooms. The

legendary lore of the islands has been fully dealt with by Lady Wilde in

h«- 'Ancient Legends of Ireland' (London, 1887), but Dr. Browne was

able to collect some additional information. An old woman in Bofin is

considered to be a witch. There are two holy wells on the islands. There

is a legend to account for the name ' Inis-bo-finne,' the Island of the White

Cow, and others, which are given at length in Dr. Browne's paper. An

impression in the rock is said to be the footprint of St. Leo. The

apparatus used for shark-fishing is very rude and primitive. The archi-

tectural antiquities on the islands are few. The earliest reference to the

district in history is that in the second century a.d. a tribe of the Firbolgs

(Clann Humoir) occupied the neighbouring mainland, and were enslaved

by Tuathal Teachtmar, a Scotic or Milesian monarch. In the seventh
century St. Colman founded the abbey in Knock-quarter. Thence to the

seventeenth, when (1652) the islands surrendered to the Parliamentary
forces, their history is a blank, and indeed they have been seldom men-
tioned since. Photographs of eleven men (including Michael Halloran,
' King ' of Shark) and five women were taken, and also of the quern and

spinning-wheel, still in use, and the method of washing clothes.

     11. Since this report was in type, a collection of peculiarities of dialect
for Brettenham and Bildeston, in the county of Suffolk, made by Mr. C. G.

progress with their work, the practicability and utility of which have,
they submit, been clearly shown in this and their previous report. The grant
of \0l. has been more than expended in printing, stationery, and postage,

and in procuring two sets of the cheaper forms of instruments for lending to
observers. Tliey recommend that they be reappointed, and would be glad
if a grant could be made sufficiently libei'al to enable them to provide for
the expenses that will be necessarily incurred if observations are to be

prosecuted in any sufficient number of the places which have been indi-

cated to them as suitable.

Directions for Measurement.

--Instrument required for these measurements : The ' Traveller's

Anthropometer,' manufactured by Aston &, Mander, 25 Old Compton

Sti-eet, London, W.C. price 3/. 3s. complete ; without 2-metre steel
                                                                                               ;

measuring tape and box footpiece, 21. 10s. With this instrument all the

measurements can be taken. In a permanent laboratory it will be found

convenient to have a fixed graduated standard for measuring the height,

or a scale affixed to a wall. For field work a tape measure may be tem-

porarily suspended to a rigid vertical support, with the zero just touching

Athe ground or floor.  2-metre tape, a pair of folding callipers, a folding

square, all of which are graduated in millimetres, and a small set-square

can be obtained from Aston ik Mander for 1/. 6s. ; with this small
equipment all the necessary measurements can be taken.

  --Height Standing. The subject should stand perfectly upright, with

his back to the standard or fixed tape, and his eyes directed horizontally

forwards. Care should be taken that the standard or support for the tape

is vertical. The stature may be measured by placing the person with his

back against a wall to which a metre scale has been affixed. The height

is determined by placing a carpenter's square or a large set-square against

the support in such a manner that the lower edge is at right angles to the

scale ; the square should be placed well above the head, and then brought

down till its lower edge feels the resistance of the top of the head. The

observer should be careful that the height is taken in the middle line of the

head. If the subject should object to take off his boots, measure the

thickness of the boot-heel, and deduct it from stature indicated in boots.

   --Height Sitting. For this the subject should be seated on a low stool

or bench, having behind it a graduated rod or tape with its zero level with

the seat ; he should sit perfectly erect, with liis back well in against the

scale. Then proceed as in measuring the height standing. The square

should be employed here also if the tape against a wall is used.

  --Length of Cranixim. Measured with callipers from the most prominent

part of the projection between the eyebrows (glabella) to the most distant

point at the back of the head in the middle line. Care should be taken

to keep the end of the callipers steady on the glabella by holding it there

with the fingers, while the other extremity is searching for the maximum

projection of the head behind.

  --Breadth of Cranium. The maximum breadth of head, which is usually

about the level of the toj) of the ears, is measured at right angles to the

length. Care must be taken to hold the instrument so that both its points

--are exactly on the same horizontal level.
     Face Length. This is measured from the slight furrow which marks

the root of the nose, and which is about the level of a line drawn from the

centre of the pupil of one eye to that of the other, to the under part of the

chin. Should there be two furrows, as is often the case, measure from

between them.

  --Upper Face Length. From root of nose to the interval between the two

central front teeth at their roots.

  --Face JJreadth. Maximum breadth of face between the bony projections

in front of the ears.

  --Inter-ocular Breadth. Width between the internal angles of ths eyes.

While this is being measured the subject should shut his eyes.
    ON THE ETHNOGKArmCAL SURVEY OK THE UNITED KINGDOM. 429

     Bigonial j^rearf^/t.--Breadth of face at tlie outer surface of the angles-

--of the lower jaw below the ears.
     Nose Length. From the furrow at root of nose to the angle between

the nose and the upper lip in the middle line.
     Breadth of iA^ose.--Measured horizontally across the nostrils at the

·widest part, but without compressing the nostrils.

    Height of Head.--The head should be so held that the eyes look straight

forward to a point at the same level as themselves--i.e. the plane of vision
should be exactly horizontal. The rod of the Anthroponieter should be
held vertically in front of the face of the subject, and the upper straight
arm should be extended as far as possible and placed along the middle
line of the head ; the shorter lower arm should be pushed up to the lower
surface of the chin. "When measured with the square the depending bar
must be held vertically in front of the face (with the assistance of the
spirit-level or plumb-line), and the small set-square passed up this arm
from below in such a manner that its horizontal upper edge will come into
contact with the lower contour of the chin. The distance between the
lower edge of the horizontal bar of the square and the upper edge of the

set-square can be read off, and this will be the maximum height of the

head.

     Height of Cranium.--The head being held in precisely the same manner

as in measuring the height of the head, the instrument is rotated to the
left side of the head, its upper bar still resting on the crown, and the
recording arm (or the set-square) is pointed to the centre of the line of
attachment of the small projecting cartilage in front of the ear-hole.

     Note.-- It is essential that these rules should be strictly followed in
order to secure accuracy. All measurements must be made in millimetres.

If possible, the subject's weight should be obtained, and recorded in the
place set apart for remarks. The observer is recommended to procure

The Ethnographical Survey of Ireland.--Report of the Committee, consisting
     of Dr. C. R. Browne, Professor D. J. Cunningham, Dr. S. Haughton,

     Professor E. Perceval Wright, and Professor A. C. Haddon (Secre-
     tary). {Drawn up by the Secretary.)

     The following is a brief statement of the work done by the Committee
of the Ethnographical Survey of Ireland.

                                                     Dublin.

   A note ^ on the steps then taken and the chief objects in view was

read before the Anthropological Institute in August 1891. In December
of the same year Dr. Browne made a communication - to the Royal Irish
Academy on some instruments.

Measurements and observations have since then been continuously

made in the Anthropometric Laboratory in Trinity College, Dublin, and

up to the present time nearly 500 persons have been measured. The

tabulation of the results has been commenced.

The first ethnographical field excursion was to the Aran Islands in

Galway Bay. Instead of attention being confined to anthropometric data

it was deemed advisable to make a sociological study of the people as well.

--The table of contents of the report " as read before the Royal Irish Academy

on December 12, 1892, is as follows: 'I. Introduction ] II. Physio-

     The second expedition was to Inishbofin and Inishshark, islands off

the Xorth Galway coast. The report,^ which was on the same lines as the

previous one, was read before the Academy on November 30, 1894.

The craniology of the Irish has not been neglected by the Committee,

and accounts have been published of crania from the Aran Islands,*

Inishbofin ^, ^, and co. Tipperary.^ Dr. W. Frazer also describes two

Irish crania in 'Proc. Roy. Irish Acad.' [3], vol. ii. 1893, pp. 643-647.

    For folk-lore papers \ '', ", and ^ may be consulted.

This summer Dr. Browne made a third expedition to the west coast of

Ireland, and has brought back a large series of measurements and oljser-

vations from the district of Erris, in co. Mayo, which will be duly published

by the Royal Irisli Academy.

The work at the British lake village near Glastonbury has been much

retarded by the flood-water that accumulated during the winter, and by the
heavy rains during the spring. Digging had to be abandoned last autumn
a fortnight aftei' the Association meeting at Nottingham, and it was not

until the early part of May this year that the water had fallen low

enough to allow a recommencement of the investigations ; even up to the
date of writing, July 10, it is still necessary Lo keep the pumps in daily
use. During the seasons of 1892 and 1893 the time was chiefly taken up
with the examination of fifteen dwelling mounds, and of the causeway
and other stone and timber structures in the peat outside the village
margin. This year, so far, has been occupied with tracing the village
border to the extent of 550 feet, or about one-third of its total circum-

ference ; and the investigations have not only brought to light much

valuable information relating to the size and shape of the village, but
have established the following facts :

     (rt) That the village was originally surrounded by the water of a

shallow mere.
     (b) That five feet of peat accumulated during its occupation.
     (c) That a strong palisading of posts and piles protected the village.

     (d) That the groundwork of the village, so far at least as its margin
is concerned, is artificial for the depth of five feet.

     The palisading at the edge of the village is formed of piles three to
nine inches in diameter, and from five to eleven feet in length, kept

together by more or less coarse hurdle-work. Although in many places

--the piles are much displaced and decayed, yet they form a fairly perfect

and continuous though irregular line at some parts they are placed so

closely together that from fifty to seventy have been counted in the space

of ten feet. The majority slope outwards, having the appearance of

chevaux defrise, at angles varying with the state of preservation of the

border ; but a lai-ge proportion of them were undoubtedly driven in
vertically, and have been either broken oft' or gradually forced out into

their present position. Some piles barely reach the true peat, M'hilst

others pierce it for several feet ; occasionally a few vertical piles are still

seen among the slanting : these probably show repairs to the border.

The border of the village has a very irregular outline, the piles being

arranged in varying curves: this unevenness has been proved in some places

to be due to extension of the village. The surface of the border immedi-

ately inside the piles is formed of trunks of trees and large pieces of

timber placed side by side parallel to the margin, and reaching eight to

twelve feet inwards ; underneath these more timber is found, alternating
with layers of clay and brushwood, with which are intermingled patches

of stone, peat, rush, and bracken to the depth of live feet.

Numerous and important objects have been unearthed this season

from the peat outside the village at all depths down to seven feet three

--inches, and as far as eighty feet from the village border. Pottery hand

--and wheel made clay pellets (so-called sling-stones), baked and unbaked,

and bones of animals are still met with at all points in great quantities.

Recently a decorated wheel-made bowl of black ware has been found in

perfect preservation and highly linished, four inches high, and five inches

across the rim, besides numerous other pieces of pottery elaborately

marked with designs of circles, curved and flowing lines, and triangles.

Many of these fragments are doubtless capable of reconstruction.

  --Flint. Besides several scrapers, one good arrow-head.
  --Bro7ize. The find of greatest importance in this metal has been a

well-preserved bowl measuring 4^ inches across the rim. It is made of

two pieces riveted together : the outside decoration consists of the row of

rivet-heads or bosses almost an inch below the rim, and two fine lines of

punched work near the edge ; the under surface is semicircular, and a hole
in it had been evidently made good by riveting on a small piece. Amongst

the other objects of bronze are two more spiral finger-rings and a pen-

annular ring brooch.

   --Iron. Of this metal there is a reaping hook, together with its wooden

handle, sixteen inches in length, and a primitive sickle with riveted wood

--Ahandle complete, in length ten inches.
Lead.  spindle whorl decorated with three parallel lines, and a

--flattened disc or weight of about one and a quarter inch in diameter.
    Bones. More human remains have been met with this year than pre-

viously, including a complete skull showing several sword or axe-marks :

no other bones belonging to the body were discovered near it.

Professor Boyd Dawkins has examined the sample of animal bones

forwarded to him, and among them he has found the following mammals

and birds represented :

    Many very interesting objects have been found this year made of

cut wood, amongst them being seventeen pieces of a mortised frame-

work, probably part of a second loom, another having been found last

summer.

Portions of a small stave-made bucket with decorated side. The

greater part of a solid cut tub in fragments, six inches high, and about

twelve inches in diameter, the outside decoi'ation being of a very bold and

beautiful description.

Part of the axle of a wheel, with bases of two spokes in situ. The

length of the axle is fourteen inches, its diameter six inches, and the length
of a spoke being twelve inches. The whole is of light construction and
of perfect workmanship, and was probably a potter's wheel.

   A large font- shaped block of timber, three feet high and two feet in

diameter. The top is flat, showing complete impressions of the sharp
edge of the axe with which it was cut.

     Unbaked clay pellets, or so-called sling-stones, have been found in
hundreds, and among the other things dug out of the peat are spindle

whorls, quern stones, wattle, and ci'e vice- marked clay, and portions of
loom weights. The bones of animals have been met with in such quantities

in some places that a wheel-barrow full has been obtained from a square

yard of peat.

     The botanical specimens have been submitted to Mr. J. G. Baker,
r.R.S., of Kew, who has kindly given the following report, and further

specimens are to be forwarded to him.

      ' Report on the peat from the British village at Glastonbury :

   --' Leaves. It contained abundant leaves of Salix cinerea, a species

everywhere abundant in Britain at the present time, not restricted to

damp places. On some of the leaves were found Rliytisma Salicinum, a

minute fungus. There were a few leaves of Myrica Gale.

   --' Twiys. Probably these belong to Salix cinerea.

  -- --^ Seeds. The abundant seeds represent three genera Ranunculus, Pota-

mogeton, and Carex. All these are large genera, and it is impossible to

say which species they represent. Potamogeton indicates a lake or pool.

'Altogether the peat contains nothing whatever that might not be

found living in the surrounding district at the present time.'

Very careful and accurate notes are taken of everything that is found,

and all piles, posts, large pieces of timber, and stone are marked on the

plans                     the  depth  at  which important  objects  are  found is  also  noted,  and
                       ;

photographs are taken and drawings made.

     There still remain two-thirds of the village border to be traced, and
nearly fifty dwelling mounds and about five-sixths of the entire village
area to be examined.

The Committee, acting in conjunction with a Committee appointed for

the same purpose by the International Congress of Hygiene and Demo-
graphy, are now able to report on 50,000 children seen individually in

sixty-three schools by Dr. Erancis Warner, 1892-94.

The methods of examination employed, and the points observed, were
Adescribed fully in our last report.
                                      complete actuarial investigation of

the 8,941 children deviating from the normal in some respect, of whom

notes were taken, is in hand. Some portions of the statistical results ai-e

appended. The general conclusions arrived at, and recommendations
founded on the observations, are now given.

It is quite possible to report on any group of children, or group of

schools, as to the physical and mental conditions most prevalent among

them, and to compare these with an established average.

Groups of children, arranged according to their physical condition,

may be traced through the educational standards of the school, thus

showing that unconsciously those of defective body and brain condition

remain mostly in the lower standards, and are frequently over age for the

standard in which they are found.

The ages at which the children present certain physical and nerve-

irregularities can be traced, thus affording a basis for the determination

of the age-prevalence of defective conditions, and the most frequent ages

at which they appear and disappear.

The general results of detailed study of the conditions of school

children show that

There is a large group of children who appear to need special care and

training, including the crippled, maimed, deformed, and paralysed ; children

--mentally deficient or presenting some deficiency ; and epileptics : Boys,

157; Girls, 147.

    To these maybe added children constitutionally weak and dull, making

altogether about sixteen per 1,000 of the child population. As to methods

of reporting and certifying these cases, see last paragraph of this report.

Defects in development indicate inherited and congenital tendency to

delicacy, both of body and in brain action ; they are extremely frequent
in all classes of society, not least so among the upper social grades. It
                                                                              ;

.appears probable that, to a great extent, such defects may be rendered less
numerous among the population by hygienic care with regard to buildings,

light and air, &c.

    As to children presenting irregularities of the nerve-system, their
careful training may do much to prevent them from growing up perma-
nently nervous or mentally dull. Many children unconsciously imitate

habits of listlessness, inattention, carelessness, and even the appearances

of fatigue and hysteria from one another, or from their teachers.

The knowledge gained renders it possible to indicate the kind of

training adapted to any case described. This particularly applies to the

nerve-signs, or irregularities in nerve-action recorded. After pointing out

to the teacher the irregularities present in the child, so that their increase

or decrease can be watched during class work, indications may be given as

to the best modes of removing these special nervous and mental defects.

That such explanations may be understood by the teachers it is very

desirable that they should receive some special instruction. Economy in

the labour of teachers might thus be effected, and better educational

results obtained.

School organisation by the teachers is mainly founded upon their

experience of the child's mental ability and work in school. This takes

time, and frequently a new pupil is not placed in a suitable standard till

Asome weeks of experience show the child's mental capacity.  knowledge

of the points observed in this inquiry might facilitate the responsible work

of classification for educational purposes.

Two standards frequently, though not always, met with in a school

call for special remark. In Standard 0, or Primers, the children are col-

lected who, being over age for the infant school, are still too backward
for Standard I. In Standard Ex. VII. we find the children who have

passed through the ordinary classes of the school. The experience of
hospital physicians and many philanthropic societies shows that neglect of
feeble-minded children of all grades leads to much social evil. The blind
and the deaf are happily now cared for under the provisions of the Ele-

mentary Education Act, 1893, and teachers are specially ti-ained for this

work ; but the children of the various grades of feebleness short of imbecility,
children who present a deficiency, are in many schools unwelcome, and no

encouragement is given to school authorities to collect and care for them

they are an incumbrance if not properly provided for, and untrained they

tend to social failure, pauperism, and criminality. Mere accumulations of

dull children in a certain class, whether a class of Primers, or in a lower

section of Standard III. for older children, may make the other class-

rooms brighter, but, when children below average power are accumulated,

there arises a greater responsibility for their individual care, which must

be met by the provision of a sufiicient staff of specially trained teachers.

Scientific advice as to the management of deficient children is useful, but

teachers must carry out the details of special training. Nurses for the
sick are now highly trained and well paid ; they take an intelligent in-
terest in the patients ; the more difficult the case, and the more attention
it requires, the greater are their interest and desire for success. Training

of teachers for the care of the more difficult children, and honour for the

hard work of improving feeble children, may cultivate a higher professional
interest among a body of skilled teachers trained to the charge of feeble

children. Considerable success has been achieved in training the blind
and the deaf, and a large proportion of the feeble children are improvable.

                                                                   FF2

436 KEPORT--1894.

      Secondary education tends to accentuate tlie difficulties arising from
 the classification of children solely according to mental status. In
 elementary schools of higher grade, a boy entering Standard I. in the
 upper school is unacceptable unless he can work well ; after a certain age,
 the dull boy cannot conveniently be kept in the infant school ; he is too

big. He must then either be kept among the infants, for whom he is not
 good company, or go among classmates with whom he cannot profitably

 work. To meet such cases it often happens that there is a class of
 Primers, but without any special arrangements for individual culture.
 In such schools the brighter children are well educated : at fourteen they
 get the prizes of the school and enter social life at an advantage ; the dull
 children have not only been left comparatively uncultured, but by raising

 a class distinctly superior to themselves, they find the struggle for existence
 becoming intensified.

      In all public expenditure, sums of money spent in secondary education
 should be accompanied by a proportional expenditure for tlie benefit of
 the dull and weak children. This is equivalent to the enactment which
 requires that schemes for the sanitary improvement of a neighbourhood,
 while providing good new dwellings, should also make provision for the
 poorer population displaced thereby. The child of good inheritance in
 brain power receives free education, and in consequence makes the dull
 child's life more difficult. The public interest I'equires that each child

 shall be trained to get a living.
      Recommendations :
      That a scientific statement of all observable conditions of child-life

--including elementary anthropometric examination should be prepared by

 observation of at least 100,000 children.
      That School Boards, in taking their triennial census of children in

their district, should register any mentally defective children, or children

otherwise afilicted.
      That teachers should be specially trained to undertake the educational

care of weak and mentally feeble children.
      That lectures sliould be provided on the observation, study, and

classification of children as to conditions bearing on mental life and
education. This might consist of an elementary course and of University

teaching.

     That the Act to make better Provision for the Elementary Education
of Blind and Deaf Children in England and Wales [56 and 57 Vict.],
chap. 42, should be extended to include children with mental and bodily
defects incapacitating them from ordinary school instruction.

      That in the appropriation of funds for secondary education a propor-
tional sum should be devoted to the special training of the dull and feeble.

     That the Government be recommended to consult a scientific expert
to assist the Education Department, the Local Government Board, and

the Home Office in carrying out the above recommendations, and to report

upon the whole subject generally as to the care of children whose education
is supervised by the Government.

   A form suggested for certification of a feeble-brained or defective

child as requiring exceptional training is appended. Another certificate
by a school teacher might be required if the child is attending school.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed as before, and ask a further

grant in aid of the work.

In order to ascertain in what schools anthropometric work was being
carried on, and in what mannei*, also what prospect there was of further
development in this direction, a circular was prepared, a copy of which is
subjoined to this report (Appendix I.).

This circular, together with a letter asking that it might be filled up

--and returned, and a stamped and directed envelope, was sent to 624 schools
   495 for boys and 129 for girls. The former included all those given in

'Whitaker's Almanack.' The latter were the schools whose mistresses

belong to the Association of Head Mistresses of Endowed and Pro-
Aprietary Schools.
                    large number of these institutions did not reply, but
--398 returns were obtained viz. 309 boys' and 89 girls' schools.

The results obtained from these returns are as follows :

     1. Measurements are taken in 58 schools, of which 11 are for girls
and 47 for boys.

APPENDIX II.

Suggestions for Anthropometric Observations in Schools.

Grouj) A. Essential Observations.

--I. Height. To be taken in socks or stockings. The subject should

stand perfectly upright, the head held so that the line of vision is

--horizontal that is, the eyes directed horizontally forwards to a point on

the same level as their pupils. Any good sliding rod may be used, such

as the Laboratory Stadiometer, supplied by Messrs. Aston & Mander,

25 Old Compton Street, Soho, London. (Price 2?. 2s.)
--II. Weight. To be taken in gymnastic clothes where possible ; a
Aspring balance should not be used.
                                     good machine is supplied by

Messrs. W. cfe T. Avery, of Birmingham (No. 139, special cash price,

without chair or rod, 3^. 15s.). The measuring-rod attached to it should

not be purchased.

  --III. Chest-girth (for boys only). To be taken over the naked

chest with a Chesterman's steel tape (price 5s. 6d., Bailey & Co.,

--Bennett's Hill, Birmingham) in the following manner: (1) The boy

stands upright, with the arms stretched from the sides, the measurer

standing behind him. (2) The tape is placed over the chest immediately
--

--442 REPORT 1894.

above the nipples, and with the lower edge touching them ; it is then

brought horizontally round the chest walls, over the blade-bones to the

back. The zero of the tape should rest on the spine. (3) The boy drops
his arms. (4) Takes a deep breath. (5) Counts slowly from one to ten.

(6) At the word ' ten ' the measurer draws the tape tight and records the
measurement. When this is done, care should be taken to see that the

tape is exactly horizontal both in front and behind.

     The above measurements should be taken twice (or, if desired, thrice)

annually.

   --IV. Tests of Vision. These tests will serve to detect the presence

of certain common defects of vision. Such defects are often overlooked
or disregarded, to the permanent detriment of the puj^il. The tests will

not reveal the nature or cause of a defect. This can only be determined
by an expert.

   --(a) AcuTENESS OF VisiON. (1) Hang on the wall, in a good light, a

set of Snellen's Test Letters ; these are in general use, and afford records
which can be universally compared. iVo others should be substituted for

theiv.. (2) Draw a line on the floor ab a distance of exactly six metres

from the letters, and let each pupil in turn toe this line and try to read

the letters, line after line, beginning at the top ; in all cases without

spectacles or eye-glasses. Eacli eye is to be tested separately, the other
eye being covered, but not pressed upon, by a large card held in the pupil's

hand. (3) Record the vision of each eye separately in the form of a
fraction ; for instance, thus :

                              R. V=:t

                              L. V = A

--The numerator is in all cases 6 i.e. the distance of the letters in metres
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the denominator is the number which stands over the lowest line of letters

-- Vwhich can be read. When the vision is less than /^jj it should be recorded
by the appropriate sign viz.  < /^. (4) Take care that the pupils

have no opportunity of learning the letters by rote.

  --Note. When the vision of either eye is found to be represented by a

fraction having a denominator of more than 18, it will generally be

desirable to report the fact to the parent or guardian, in order that proper

advice may be obtained, such report being omitted if this has already

been done.

  --(6) Colour Visiox. (1) Use Holmgren's Series of Coloured Wools.

(2) Place them in a heap on a white cloth, in a good light. (3) Lay,

--apart from the heap, the test skein a pale, pure green. (4) Explain to

the pupil that he is to select from the heap and place beside the test

skein all those which appear to him to be of the same kind of colour.

Do not require him to name them or match them exactly, but to select

those which are most nearly like the test-skein in colour. (5) Mix the

wools again for each pupil, but always use the pale pure green as the test.

  A -- --certain number of the pupils boys, very rarely girls will match

the test-skein falsely with buffs, pinks, and other colours which have no

green tint, or will hesitate much before rejecting such. These pupils are

more or less colour-blind, and are thereby permanently unfitted for

vocations on land or sea which require good colour vision. Record

the defect.

  --Note. Ascertain by this same test that the person who conducts the

colour-testing is not himself colour-blind. Such cases have been known.

                            ON ANTHROPOMETKIC WORK IN SCHOOLS.                    44'3

      The Acuteness of Vision of each pupil should be tested once a j'ear,
since certain defects of eye-sight commonly begin during school life.

      The test for Colotir Vision need not be repeated, since colour-blindness,

except that which occurs with disease of the eye, is congenital, not

acquired.

      The test-letters (price is. 6d. framed) and coloured wools (price

is. 6rf.) may be obtained from Messrs. Bailey &. Co., Bennett's Hill,

Birmingham, or other makers of optical instruments.

   --V. Hearing (Voice Test). (1) Instruct the pupil to close the eyes

and to repeat any words spoken by the observer. (2) The observer
should stand at the opposite side of the room and say words for the pupil
to repeat, pitching his voice in an ordinary conversational tone. (3) The
observer should gradually approach the pupil until he is distinctly heard.
(4) The distance should be compared with that at which words, uttered
in the same tone, are heard by a person of known good hearing. (5) In
order to test the hearing power of each ear separately, the pupil should

stop one with his finger whilst the other is being examined.

   --(Watch Test). (1) The greatest distance at which the tick of the

watch to be used can be heard must be ascertained by testing with it a
person of known good hearing. (The hearing distance of an English
lever watch is about 60 inches.) (2) Let the pupil close his eyes, stop
the left ear with his finger. (3) Instruct him to say when he first hears
the tick. (4) The observer stands at the pupil's right side, holding the
watch outside the range of hearing and on a level with the pupil's ear.

(5) He gradually brings the watch nearer to the pupil until the tick is

distinctly heard. (6) The left ear should then be tested in the same
manner. (7) The two distances and the hearing distance of the watch
should be recorded in inches. Thus, if the hearing distance of the watch
be 60 inches, and the pupil hears it with the right ear at 40 inches, and
with the left at 2.5, the result should be recorded as

                                                                   ^^- 60

     These fractions must not be reduced to their lowest term. The watch
method is the better, but more troublesome. If used for children, it
must be repeated two or three times at the same examination, as the

--statements are often unreliable. The same watch must always be used.
     Note. Inattention in children is often due to deafness. In all cases
of deafness, the attention of the parent should be called to the necessity
for treatment, especially if (a) there is a discharge of matter from the
ears, or (b) the pupil seems always to have a cold, or (c) constantly
breathes through the mouth instead of the nose. Observations as to
hearing should be made twice annually.

                            Group B. ^on-essential Observations.

--Other valuable observations are  (1)  size of  head                (2) span of  arms
                                                                  ;                                 ;

(3) length of trunk. These observations can be rapidly and easily

taken                       but in order to avoid over-burdening this circular,  no instructions
                         ;

respecting them are here given. Any person desirous of carrying them

out will receive full instructions by applying to the Secretary of the

Committee,

REPORT 1894.

--Anthropomef ric Laboratory. Report of the Committee, consisting of

    Sir W. H. Flower {Ghairman), Dr. J. G. Garson (Secretary),
     Mr. G. W. Bloxam, Dr. Wilberforce Smith, Professor A. C.

      Haddon, a7id Professor Windle.

The Committee have to report that at the Nottingham meeting of the

Association an excellent laboratory was provided for them in the Univer-
sity College buildings, where many of the Sections met. The services of
a clerk were as usual placed at the disposal of the Committee, and by the
kind permission of Mr. Francis Galton those of the superintendent of his
laboratory at South Kensington were again available for measuring the
members of the Association who visited the laboratory.

     The schedule of observations and measurements made on each person
examined included the sex, age, birthplace, residence, occupation, colour
of eyes and of hair, profile of nose ; height when sitting, kneeling, and

standing ; vertical pi'ojection from the vertex of the head to tragus, mouth,

and chin ; maximum antero-posterior length and transverse breadth of

head, from which the cephalic index is obtained ; the length and breadth
of the nose, which gives the data for the nasal index ; the nasio-mental

length of face and the bizygomatic or maximum face breadth, from which

the facial index has been calculated ; length of upper limb from the
acromion to the tip of middle linger; length of cubit and of hand (right);
breadth of shoulders (bihumeral) and of hips (bitrochanteric) ; span of
arms ; weight in ordinary clothing ; strength of grasp ; vital capacity of
the chest, strength of vision, sense of colour. This last was tested, in
conformity with the recommendations of the Committee of the Royal Society
on the subject, with coloured wools. The colour of eyes and hair was
noted in accordance with Dr. Beddoes method, which has been adopted
for the Ethnographical Survey of Great Britain and Ireland.

     The attention of the Committee has been called by Professor Edge-
worth to the fact that the 'corrected mean' of each measurement as given
in the reports of former years is not satisfactory, in that it assumes the

--dimension at the 25th and 75th grades i.e. at the first and third quartile

(Q, and Q-,), to be more accurate than that at the 50th grade (i.e. Q.,)-

He has supplied them with a simple formula wherein the probable error

at all three grades is taken into account. After several tests the superior
accuracy of Professor Edgeworth's formula has been proved, and has been

adopted in this report. His formula may be stated as follows :

    Corrected mean=-^^--^^^--^. If the sum of Qi-fQs is greater

than 2Q2, the difference is divided by 3'2, and the I'esult is added to Q2
but if the sum of 2Q2 is greater than Q, + Qj, the latter is deducted from
the former, the difference divided by 3'2, and the product subtracted
from Qj.

     Since the close of the meeting the observations recorded during it have
been carefully worked up, under the direction of the Secretary, after the
plan which has been adopted in former years. Progress has also been made
in amalgamating the results of all the Association laboratoiy statistics,

which now amount to about 1,000.
     The Committee are glad to be able to report that the measurements

made in the laboratory of the Association for the last seven years have
been of material service to Her Majesty's Government in connection with

be established in England. They have also been of use in comparing

observations made on native races of different countries, and determining
their deviation from or agreement with British people. The Committee

--454 REPORT 1894.

     The Indian Tribes of the Lower Fraser River. By Dr. Franz Boas.

      la the sixth report of the Committee I described the customs of tlie
Lka'ngED, the most southern group of the Coast Salish living on British
territory. The northern neighbours of the Lku'ngEn, who will be de-
scribed in the following pages, speak the K'auetcin (Cowichan) language.
This dialect of the Coast Salish is spoken on Vancouver Island from Saa-
nitch Inlet to Nonoos, on the islands north of Saanitch Peninsula and on
the Lower Fraser River as far as Yale. The language as spoken on Van-
couver Island and on the mainland shows slight dialectic differences, the
most striking ones being the general substitution of I for n, and of a for (7,,
on Fraser River. I have given elsewhere some notes on the tribes of
Cowichan River and of Nanaimo which belong to this group.' Therefore
I confine myself in the following pages to remarks on the tribes of the

mainland, whom I studied in the summer of 1890.

     The Cowichan of the mainland are divided into fourteen tribes, each
forming a village community. The inhabitants of each village are believed

to be the descendants of one mythical personage. I give here a list of

tribes, their villages, and the names of the mythical ancestors :

sidered as an interesting phase in the development of totemism. Some
of the more complicated institutions of this class may have originated from

similar concepts.

    A few of the tribes have certain privileges not shared by the others.

This is particularly the case of the Sqoa'eqoe, the curious feathered head
with prominent eyes which I have described on a former occasion ('Proc.
U.S. National Museum,' 1888, p. 212), and which is the crest of certain

families among the Catloltq (Comox) and Nanairao. This cx'est belongs
originally to several tribes of the mainland. The Sqoa'eqoe are believed

to be a supernatural people living in lakes. When a person succeeds in

bringing one of them to the surface of the water he and his descendants
acquire their protection and assume their figure as the crest of their
family. It belongs to the Sk'au'elitsk, Ewa'wus, and Ts'akuii'm. The
Sk'au'elitsk tell that their ancestor, K-ulte'mEltQ, had two sons and two
daughters. The latter went fishing every morning. One day they canght
first each a trout. Later on they felt that they had caught something
heavy, and on hauling in the line saw the prominent eyes and the long

feathers of the Sqoa'eqoe. They called their father, who carried him

home, but soon the being disappeared and only his dress remained.

K'ulte'mEltQ's descendants married in the Stsee'lis, QmE'ckoyim, Snanai'-
muQ, Sk'oa'nic, K'auetcin, and (^Jatloltq tribes, and thus the use of the

Sqoa'eqoe was disseminated. The Ewa'wns tell that an orphan boy went
swimming and diving every day in order to get strong. One day he

made a fire near a lake and accidentally spat into the water. When he

dived he was almost drowned. At the bottom of the lake he found the

Sqoa'eqoe trying to heal a sick girl of their people whom the saliva had

hit and made sick. The boy washed her and she recovered at once.
Then they gave him the Sqoa'eqoe. The Ts'akuii'm say that their

ancestor found the Sqoa'eqoe.

     In the above list of tribes the Kni'kotlEm of Tcane'tcEn have been

omitted. They are descendants of slaves of TlpElk'e'lEn, chief of the
K"oa'antEl, who established a fishing station at the site of the Kui'kotlEm
village, and ordered part of his slaves to live at this place. Five gene-
rations ago, when wars were raging on this part of the coast, they became
free, and continue to occupy their old village. They are, howevei*, not
considered as equals of the other tribes, and never owned any land. They
do not claim to be the descendants of a mythical ancestor. Their present
chief is named T'E'lk'Es.

     The tribal traditions of these people are evidently founded on his-
torical events. This becomes particularly clear in the cases of the
Stsee'lis and of the Tc'ilEQue'uk". The tradition of the former says that
TsTi'tsEmiltQ, the ancestor of the tribe, was sent down to StsEe'lis from
heaven. One of his descendants built a fish weir on one of the tributaries
of Harrison River, and thus deprived another tribe on the upper reaches
of the river of its food supply. K'ulk'E'mEHil, chief of this tribe (who
were descendants of the marten and of the mountain-goat), sent his sons
down the river to see why the salmon did not come as usual. They found
the weir and tried to destroy it, but were captured by Ts'a'tsEmiltQ's sons,
who invited the tribe to descend from the hills and to live in StsEe'lis.
They followed the invitation, and ever since have lived with the StsEe'lis.

     According to tradition the Tc'ilEQue'uk" spoke, until the beginning of
this century, the Nooksak language, which prevails farther to the south.

The tribal myth states expressly thab the tribe was originally a mountain
--456 REPORT 1894.

tribe living on the upper reaches of Chilluwak River, and that they
migrated down the river.

     Evidently historical traditions are preserved relatively faithfully by
these tribes. This is shoven particularly clearly in the care v?hich is taken

in preserving the pedigrees of chiefs. I obtained one of these embracing
eight generations. I reproduce here that part of the same which I have

been able to corroborate by repeated inquiries among different branches of
the family. The chief of a tribe always takes the name of the preceding

chiefs, sometimes that of the mythical ancestor, which accounts for the

recurrence of the same names. When a person has relatives in two

villages, he is known by two names. In each village be is called by a
name belonging to the village. Thus ' Captain George ' is known as

Ts'a'tsEmiltQ in StsEe'lis, as Qa'wulEts in Sk'tsa's, north cf Harrison Lake.

These pedigrees are also of some interest, as they show the mode of

intermarriage among the tribes of these regions, and as they bring out

the extermination of whole families very clearly. It appears that the

mortality of children is the principal cause of diminution, much more so

than decrease in the number of children to each family.

It appears that the tribes of Harrison River intermarry with the

Lillooet tribes north of Harrison Lake. These tribes are organised essen-

tially in the same way as those of Eraser River, each village community

claiming a common ancestor. Thus the ancestor Qa'wulEts of the Sk'tsa's

is said to have been a bear, who assumed the human form and built a

town                            the PotE'mtEn  claim  to  be  the  descendants  of  a  stone hammer
                             ;

and of chips which married two women.

I do not need to describe the houses of these tribes, as they are the

same as those of the Lku'ngEn. Above Harrison River subterraneous

lodges like those of the Shushwap were sometimes used, although tlie

large wooden houses were more common. I was told that the chief of

Sk'tsa's, north of the upper end of Harrison Lake, owned a house with

Apainted front.                 carved pole with the figure of a raven on top stood in

front of the house.

    The mode of life, fishing, use of canoe and implements do not differ

materially from those of the Lku'iigEn.

                      CuSTOiMS REFEERING TO MaKKIAGE AND DeATH.

     The marriage customs are almost the same as those of the Lku'iigEn.

When a young man desires to marry a certain girl he informs his parents.

After having gained their consent he goes to the house of the girl's father

and sits down outside close to the door. At night he returns home. For
three days he continues to sit there silently. Then the girl's father,
knowing his intentions, invites many people and has mats and blankets
spread near the fire. He sends two old men to invite the young man,
who enters the house following this invitation. He is seated on a mat
and a pile of blankets is placed near him. His father, who kept a watch-
man near the house, is informed at once, when the young man is invited
to enter the house. He sends four blankets to the two old men who
invited his son. The girl's mother meanwhile prepares a large dish
filled with choice food, which her husband presents to the young man.
The latter eats a little and returns home. Then his father sends presents

of blankets and other valuables to the girl's father. This is continued

for three or four days, when the girl's father is asked if he is willing to
give the girl in marriage to the youth. The consent being given, the

groom's father asks all his relatives and followers to assemble on the
following morning in order to fetch the bride. They load their canoes
with food and blankets and start for the bride's house. Meanwhile her
house is cleaned, and after some time the canoes land, the blankets are
carried up to the house, and after the purchase of the girl has been
settled, the dishes filled with food are carried to the house. The fathers
exchange promises of kindly treatment of the couple, in the course of which

the groom's father states that he paid a high price for the girl, because

he wants to prevent a separation of the couple. Then the visitors return
to their canoes. After some time four old men lead the bride to the canoe,

holding her by her blanket. Among the tribes entitled to the privilege of
using the Sqoa'eqoe, one of these men wears the Sqoa'eqoe mask. He

follows the girl. Another one carries a rattle. They walk over mats or

blankets spread from the door to the landing-place. After they have
delivered the bride to the groom, they are paid two blankets each by the

groom's father. The latter distributes blankets repeatedly among the

bride's relatives, first in her house, later on before leaving, from the

canoe, an old man of his family delivering an oration meanwhile. Then
blankets are given to the chief of the bride's family, who distributes them.

Before the visitors leave, the bride's father presents blankets to the groom's

father, who distributes them among his people. When the pai'ty arrive

at the groom's house, his parents, uncles, and aunts receive the young
wife with presents. After the marriage the two families feast each other

frequently.

     Sometimes chiefs betroth their children in early youth. They bind
themselves by exchanging presents. In this case the ceremonies are
somewhat simpler. The parents guard their children with particular

care. When they are old enough to be married the youth assembles

many of his friends and sends word to his bride's parents, stating when
he intends to come. At the appointed time he lands and brings many

presents, food and blankets, to his bride's father, which the latter distri-
--458 REPORT 1894.

bates among his family. The bride's father presents one blanket and
some food to each of his visitors, who depart, taking the bride along. As

a rule, the latter follows her hasband. When she gets old and sickly she

often returns to her own village, in order to be buried with her relatives.
Only when some of her children preceded her in death she is buried with

them. Although chiefs were in the habit of taking wives in other
villages, marriages among families of the same village were not forbidden.

     The customs of the Lillooet tribes above Fort Douglas were different.

Girls when of age slept with their mothers. When a man intended to

marry a girl he crept stealthily up to her bed and tried to take hold of
her heel. The meaning of this action is said to be founded on the fact

that the heel of the woman is near her private parts when she squats, as
Indian women are in the habit of doing. She informs her father at once
that a certain man has taken hold of her heel, and he must marry her.
She follows the young man to his parents. As soon as they arrive, the
groom's mother fills many baskets with boiled food and sends them to

the bride's mother, while the male relatives of the youth carry blankets

and other presents to the girl's father. They are invited to sit down and
given a feast. The bride's father sends the groom bows and arrows and
shoes that he may be able to hunt for his wife. The groom's mother
gives her dentalia for her hair, earrings, and bracelets. After the young
man has killed a number of deer he carries them, helped by his friends,
to his wife, and asks her to take them to his father-in-law. She asks
several women to help her, and they take the meat to her father's house.
The young couple and the parents continue to exchange pi-esents for

several years.

      I have not learned anything of importance regarding customs refer-
ring to birth. The names are given by paternal and maternal relatives,

and each family and tribe has its own names. For this reason each person

has several names, and is called in each village differently : in his mother's

village by the name of the maternal relative after whom he is called ; in

his father's village by the name of the paternal relative whose name he

has received.

   --The ancient burial customs were described to me as follows : Each

family had its own burial-place, which consisted of a large box or a small
house built on piles. This building was erected by members of the
family only, and all those who helped to make it received ten blankets in
payment from the chief. All the members of a family were placed in
this box or house. The first one to die was placed in the north-east
(or north-west) corner, the face turned eastward, the body Ij'ing on its
left side. The next one was placed south of the first, and so on until
one row was filled. Then a new row was begun, and the dead ones were
all deposited in the same box until it was full. Persons who were very

fond of each other were often placed side by side. When the building

was full, the bones were taken out, put on new blankets, cleaned, and
placed in a new box. Evidently they were piled up in one corner, as
there was room for additional burials in the new box. After the bones

had been replaced three or four times, they were not taken out again, but

a new house was erected. Chiefs and common people were buried in

 separate houses or boxes.

   --The burial ceremonies were as follows : ^Immediately after a death

had occurred, the corpse was prepared for burial by an old man, who had
first to chew cedar leaves as a protection against the dangerous influences
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  459

 of contact with a corpse. He washed the body, painted it red, put on

  the bracelets and other ornaments of the deceased, doubled it up, so that

 Athe knees touched the chin, and wrapped it in blankets or mats.

 young mau must not do this work, as he would die soon. When the

  deceased had been a chief or a personage of importance, all the neigh-

  bouring tribes were invited to take part in the following ceremonies.
  After they had assembled, the wife of the chief mourner gave each water
  to wash his face. Then the guests were given a feast, and on the follow-

  ing day the corpse was placed in a canoe and removed to the burial-ground,
  where it was deposited not far from the scaffold which served for the final
 burial. The guests returned to the house, and were given again water to
 wash their faces. For four days the body was left standing, that the
  dead might be able to return in case he should resuscitate. Then, on
 the fifth day, before sunrise, and before partaking of any food, the
 mourners and guests returned to the burial-ground. If the deceased

 owned the Sqoa'eqoe, the latter was carried there by an old man, who

 received payment for this service. Slaves, blankets, and other property of

 the deceased were taken along. Fonr old men put the body into the
 house. They must fast until late in the evening, when the chief mourner
 gave a feast. The slaves were killed and placed on top of the burial-

 house, where the blankets were also deposited. Other objects were tied

 to branches of trees near the burial-ground. Only those objects which the
 deceased valued most highly were placed in the house. It is stated that
 the people were allowed to take away all those objects which were
 deposited near the box. In the evening of the same day the chief
 mourner gave a feast, during which everything was burned that belonged

 to the deceased. An old man threw the objects into the fire. The

 guests were presented with blankets, and returned home. If the
 deceased was a chief, his son fasted and bathed in ponds on the mountains,
 until he believed that he had seen a spirit which gave him supernatural

powers. Then he began to collect property. When he had gathered a

 large amount, he invited all the neighbouring tribes, and gave a feast

which lasted for four days. Then he selected two old men, who had to
tell the people that he was going to assume his father's name. The
young man, with his wife and children, stood on the scaffold in frotit of
their house, and while the woman and children were dancing there, the
old men delivered orations, and the young chief distributed blankets
among his guests, throwing the blankets down from the scaffold.

      It does not appear that it is forbidden to mention the names of

deceased persons.

     The burial customs of the Lillooet are somewhat different. I was

told that the dead are placed ' so that their backo never turn toward the
sun.' They are laid on their left sides, the head westward, the face

southward. Old men are hired to paint the face of the deceased, and
they deposit the body in a cave as described before. The weapons and

implements used by the deceased are buried near the grave, but his
friends are said to be permitted to keep some of his implements, provided

the son consents.

                                      Hunting and Fishing.

    Man and all animals which are hunted are considered one greafc

family. The porcupine is called the eldest brother, and is considered the
strongest. Next in rank is the beaver, third the ts'etspet (?), fourth
460 REPORT-- 1894.

the buffalo, fifth the mountain-goaf, sixth the black bear, seventh the elk,

eighth the marten, ninth the eagle. The mink is one of the very last
among the brothers. Accordingly there are a number of restrictions and

regulations referring fco hunting.

    When a porcupine is killed, the hunter asks his elder brother's

pardon, and does not eat of the flesh until the ensuing day.

The mountain-goat hunter fasts and bathes for several nights. Then

early in the morning he paints his chin with red paint, and draws a red

line over his forehead down to the point of his nose. Two tail feathers

of the eagle are fastened to his hair. These ornaments are believed to
enable him to climb well.

The elk hunter adorns his hair with coal, rod paint, and eagle-down.

His chin is painted red, and two red lines are drawn horizontally across

his face, one passing between nose and mouth, the other over his eyes.

    Those who go to catch sturgeon bathe in a pond early in the morning.

They rub themselves with bundles of a plant called tsWutlptie until they

bleed. Then they smear their bodies and faces with red paint, and strew

white eagle-down on their heads. Each winds a thread made of mountain,

Agoat wool around his head, and another one around his waist.  woven

blanket of mountain. goat wool is painted red, and put on. The fish is

--caught in the following manner : Two canoes are allowed to drift down

river, a net being stretched between them. The oarsmen are seated on

the outer sides of the canoes only. The net is stretched between two
poles. As soon as a sturgeon is caught, the two canoes approach each

other, and the net is wound up by means of the poles. While this is

being done the ' sturgeon hunter ' sings, and by means of his song pacifies

the struggling sturgeon, who allows himself to be killed. The fisherman

must disti'ibute the sturgeon among the whole tribe, each person receiving

a portion according to his rank. I was told that the Tc'ilEQue'uk- do not

catch sturgeon. This is probably due to their recent immigration to the

Fraser River Delta.

The origin of the various designs of ornamentation used by hunters

i« made clear by the following story, which was told to me by George

StsEe'lis, chief of that tribe. His grandfather, who was chief at Sk'tsa's,

accofnpanied another man on a bear hunt. After two days' search they

found the tracks of a black bear, and soon their dog scented the cave in

which the bear was asleep. They tried to stir him up by means of long

sticks. When he did not come they made a large fire at the entrance of

the cave in order to smoke him out. Still he did not come. Then the

hunters thought he was dead, and the companion of George's grandfather

crawled into the cave. At once the bear took hold of his head and

dragged him into the cave. The grandfather, on seeing this, fainted,

and remained in a swoon for three days. When he awoke, he saw his

companion coming out of the cave. He told him : ' When I was hauled

into the cave, the bear took off his bearskin blanket, and I saw that he

was a man. He bade me sit down, and told me : Henceforth, when you

go to hunt bears, paint the point of your arrow red, and draw a red line

along its shaft. Draw a line of mica across your face from one temple to

the other across your eyes, and one line of mica over each cheek vertically

downward from the eyes.' When the hunters reached home they told

their experiences. Henceforth the people followed the instructions of the

bear-man, and were successful when hunting bears.

The panther is not hunted by the StsEe'lis, because he is supposed to
ON THE NOKTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                               461

help the people when hunting deor. In reference to this belief, George

StsEe'lis told me that his grandfather and a man named A'm'amaltsen

went hunting in their canoes on Harrison Lake. Soon they saw a number

of deer crossing the lake. A'm'amaltsen went in pursuit, but George's

grandfather stopped on hearing a panther call him. He went ashore,

and immediately a panther jumped aboard and asked to be carried across

the lake. The man obeyed, and when he had almost reached the other
side, the panther jumped ashore, crying Hum! hum ! He jumped up the
mountain, and soon a great number of deer came down the hills, which

the panther had sent. Ever since that time he has helped the StSEe'lis

in hunting deer.

These tales are interesting, particularly on account of their close

similarity to the traditions of the animal totems of America,

   A great number of restrictions and regulations refer to the salmon.

These rules are similar to those observed among the other coast ti*ibe!=.

When the fishing season begins, and one of the fishermen catches the

first sockeye-salmon of the season, he carries it to the chief of his tribe,

Whowho delivers it to his wife. She prays, saying to the salmon : '  has

Wesent you here to make us happy ?  are thankful to your chief foi"

sending yon.* Then she begins to cut it. She commences at the tail,

holding the latter with her foot, and cutting along the belly towards the

head. After having reached the middle of the fish she must rise, go to

the head, hold the latter with her foot, and make another cut from the

head along the belly towards the middle of the fish, thus completing the

whole cut. She is forbidden to turn the salmon. Then the fish is roasted

on a frame placed over the fire. After one side is done, it is turned over.

The skin and the bones must not be removed. Then the whole tribe is
invited. The plant pe'pek'oi and pewter grass are placed in a basket,
rubbed, and a decoction is made of these plants, which is used as a

medicine ' for cleansing the people.' The guests drink this decoction^
and then every member of the tribe receives and eats part of the fish.
Widows, widowers, women during their menses, and youths must not eat
of the salmon. Even later on, when the fish are numerous, and these

ceremonies are dispensed with, they are not allowed to partake of fresh

salmon, but eat dried salmon only. The sockeye-salmon must always be
looked after carefully. The bones must be thrown into the river. It

is believed that then they will revive, and return to their chief in the west.

If not treated carefully, they will take revenge, and the careless fisherman

will be unlucky.

                                                       Religion.

    Man is believed to have four souls. The main soul is said to have

the shape of a mannikin, the others are the shadows of the first. lu
disease either the lesser souls, or the main one, leave the body. Shamans
can easily return the shadows, but not the main soul. If the latter leaves
the body the sick one must die. After death the main soul goes to the sun-
set, where it remains. The shadows become ghosts (puleJc oi'tsa). They
revisit the places which the deceased frequented during lifetime, and

continue to do the same actions which he did when alive. Souls are
believed to be taken away by the rising sun, which thus produces disease.
They may be recovered by shamans. The belief of the identity of the
shadow and the lesser soul accounts also for the custom that nobody
462 REPOiiT-- 1894.

must let his shadow fall on a sick shaman, as the latter might take it,
and thus replace his own lost soul.

      There are two classes of shamans : the witches (Si'owa, called S9o'wa
by the Lillooet) and the SQula'm. The difference between the two has
been described in the sixth report of the Committee in the account of
the beliefs of the Lku'iig'En. The witch can see the wandering soul, but
she cannot return it. The SQula'm acquires his art by fasting and cere-
monial cleansing, which consists principally in bathing and vomiting.

This is continued until he has a revelation. In his incantations he uses
rattling anklets and bracelets around wrists and above elbows, which arc

made of deer hoofs and bird claws. When it is the object of his incanta-

tion to recover a lost soul, he covers himself with a large mat, and begins
to dance, stamping energetically, until he is believed to sink into the

ground as far as his belly. While the incantation continues, which may

be for one or even two days, the sick one must fast. Then the shaman

lies motionless while his soul goes in pursuit of that of the patient.

When it returns with the lost soul, the shaman begins to move again, and

shouts. His cries refer to imaginary incidents of his journey and to

dangers of the road. As soon as he begins to move, his wife places a
cup of water near him, which she heats by means of hot stones. Then
he rises, holding the soul in his clasped hands. Ho blows on it four
times and sprinkles it four times with the warm water. After having
warmed it by these means, he puts it on the sick person's head. Then it
enters the body through the frontal fontanelle. He presses on it four
times and rubs it down the body, which the soul fills entirely. Tlie
shaman blows some water on the chest and back of the sick person, who
is then allowed to drink, and after some time to eat. The soul may
escape while the shaman is trying to put it into the body of the patient.
Tlaen ho must go once more in pursuit. Sometimes the shaman sees the
main soul breaking into several parts. The owner of the broken soul

must die.
     The sun plays an important part in the beliefs of these tribes. It

has been stated that he carries away souls. He is also believed to send

dreams and to give the fasting youth revelations. After continued fast-
ing in the solitude of the mountains, the sun revealed to him the super-

natural power which was to be his helper. George StsEe'lis told me that

Ills grandfather was instructed by the sun to take a large piece of bone
jiud to carve the design of a mouth on it ; this was to protect him in war.

When he was wounded the bone sucked the blood from his wounds and

vomited it, thus curing him. Once in a battle fought with the Lillooet

he was wounded in the abdomen. He escaped on the ice of the lake,
dragging his entrails. He replaced them and bandaged himself with
cedar-bark. By the help of his bone implement he recovered.

     The sun told warriors before the battle if they would be wounded.
After having received such a warning they demanded to be buried, with their
legs stretched out, as it was believed that the sun might restore them to

life. By continued fasting warriors acqaired the faculty of jumping

high and far, which enabled them to escape the missiles of their enemies.
This was considered essentially a supernatural power, and one warrior
was said to have jumped as far as eighteen fathoms. Warriors went
naked and were forbidden to eat before or during an attack. Their
bodies and faces were painted red, and black spots or stripes of various
designs were put on their faces. They wore head ornaments of feathers.

On the upper reaches of Fraser River the custom of cutting off the heads

of the slain did not prevail, but the victor took the head ornament of
his killed enemy. The mode of warfare was the same as everywhere on

the coast : unexpected attacks on the villages of the enemies just before

the dawn of the day.
    Among other mythical personages I mention Qjils, the great trans-

former, who is often described as the principal deity. I have treated this

subject in another place.' The country of the sockeye-salmon is in the

sunset. Their chief is a powerful being, and takes care that the rules

referring to the treatment of salmon are observed. The souls of the

killed salmon return to him and are revived.

Wind, in the sunset. The east wind and the west wind are their shadows

(or souls ?). When the east wind is blowing a long time, the Indians try

to appease it. Early in the niorning they take sockeye fat and throw

it into the fire. Two pairs of heads of sockeye-salmon are painted red :

one pair is thrown into the fire, the other into the water.

TEluwa'mEt, the Milky Way, is the place where the two parts of the

sky meet. It is the road of the dead. Most of the constellations were

made by Qals, who transformed men and transferred them to the sky.
The Pleiades, for instance, were children whom Qiils met when they were

crying for their absent parents.

I heard only a few remarks referring to the dances of these ti'ibes,

which appear to have been similar to those of the Lku'iigEn. The dancing

season was called by the Kwakiutl word Me'itla. It is a very curious

fact that the raven was believed to give the dancers or the members

of the secret societies their songs, as the raven, who jjlays an important

part in the mythologies of the northern tribes, does not seem to be con-

sidered a powerful being by the tribes of Fraser River, excepting in

this one connection. One group used to tear dogs. Another one

called the Sk'e'yip inflicted wounds upon themselves, drank the blood

streaming from these wounds, and after a short time reappeared sound

and well. When they were frightened by other dancers they vomited

blood. Another group was called the TEmEqil'n. Evidently these

dances were quite analogous to the festivals of the secret societies of this

region.

I add a few current beliefs : The grass over which a widow or a

widower steps fades and withers. Before marrying again, the widow or

widower must undergo a ceremonial cleansing, as else the second husband

or wife would be subject to attacks of the ghost of the deceased.

     If one takes a particle of decayed tissue from a corpse and puts it
into the mouth of a sleeping person, the latter will ' dry up and die.'

     Chiefs' children were carefully brought up. They were instructed in
all arts. They were enjoined not to steal, and always to speak the truth.
They were not allowed to eat until late in the evening, in order to make
them industrious. Young men who returned from a successful hunting

expedition were required to distribute their game among the whole tribe.
Poor people did not train their children as carefully as chiefs and rich

people.

REPORT 1891.

--The Structure and Function of the Mammalian Heart. Report of

      the Committee^ consisting of Professor E. A. Schafer (Chairman),

     Mr. A. F. Stanley Kent (Secretanj), and Professor C. S. SHER-
      RINGTON. (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

     The research may be divided into three parts :

      1. Observations on the Structure of the Heart.
      2. Experiments on the Relation between Structure and Function.
      3. Experiments with Anaesthetics.

   --1. Observations on the Structure of the Heart. These observations

have been made principally on human hearts, and tend to show that the

condition which I have described' in the hearts of animals lower in the scale
persists even in man. That is to say, the auricles and ventricles are
connected by strands of muscular tissue passing across the groove, though,

as might be expected from my former observations, these strands are less
marked in man than in the lower animals.

      In man, as in all other animals examined, the muscular connection is
more perfect in the young condition, and the younger the subject the more

perfect the connection.

      To go more into detail, the ring at the base of the auriculo-ventricular
valves is composed of a dense mass of white fibrous tissue in which are
scattered many connective-tissue corpuscles, and this mass becomes continu-
 ous with the connective tissue running between the muscular fibres of
auricle and ventricle respectively.

     The greatest development of connective tissue takes place at the bases
of the valves, which are supported on specially thickened portions of the
ring, and are largely composed of bundles of fibres running out from it.

      Bundles of muscular tissue also occur in the valves, and these bundles
are usually connected directly with the muscle forming the walls of the
auricle. In actual shape and arrangement the fibrous tissue forming the

ring differs in different situations.

     At the posterior aspect of the left ventricle the auricular muscle is

completely separated from that of the ventricle by a more or less pyramidal
mass of connective tissue, the base of the pyramid being directed outwards
and forming part of the external surface of the heart, the apex being
directed inwards and becoming continuous with the base of the mitral
valve, The auricular muscle runs downwards on the inner aspect of this
mass of fibrous tissue, and ends as a thin sheet just above the base of the
valve. The ventricular muscle ends as a much thicker mass just beneath

the base of the valve.

    An exhaustive examination has been made of the relations of muscle

and connective tissue in this situation, but a description without figures
would be tedious, and followed only with difficulty. Suffice it to say that

in the human heart, as in the hearts of other animals, the auricles and

ventricles are connected by muscular tissue, and their connection is the
more perfect the younger the heart.

 ON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE MAMMALIAN HEART. 465

--Experiments with Ancesthetics. It will, perhaps, be best to take these two

sets of experiments together. Shortly summarised, they have been

made with the object of determining how the above-described points of
structure affect the working of the heart, and more especially what
practical use can be made of the knowledge gained in these observations.

     It is well known that in young animals it is exceedingly difficult to

--produce any effect by means of chloroform in fact, in my experiments I

have often found it almost impossible to an?esthetise animals only a few
days old. Gradually, as age increases, they become less refractory, and
at a few weeks old (in the case of kittens) chloroform produces the same

effects as in the adult.

     More than this, however, in the newly-born animal it is almost im-
possible, push the anaesthetic as you will, to produce stoppage of the heart,
though this is one of the accidents most to be feared in administering
chloroform to an adult animal. But even in the adult, if the thorax be
opened and the heart examined immediately after death by chloroform

poisoning, it will be found that, though the heart as a whole is quiescent, a
portion of it, the right auricle, is still beating. In other words, it is not
the initial stage of the beat which is absent ; the quiescence of the heart
is rather due to a failure in the transference of the beat already initiated
from auricle to ventricle. This failure occurs only in the adult or nearly
adult heart, and it has been shown that it is precisely in these adult or
nearly adult hearts in which the connecting link between auricle and
ventricle is reduced to a minimum. The failure of the heart's action, then,

may be supposed to be due to the failure of a strand muscle of compara-

tively small sectional area to convey to the ventricle a wave of contraction

started in the auricle.

      It occurred to me, then, that it might be possible in cases of chloroform
poisoning to so improve the conducting power of this strand of muscle as
to enable the waves of contraction to once again pass over the junction
and cause contractions of the ventricle.

    My experiments upon this point are at pi-esent incomplete, but I have

obtained results which lead me to hope that the research will not be

entirely without practical results.

       On recent Itesearches in the Infra-red Spectrum.

                [PLATES II.-IV.]

       [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in exte7iso.']

I PRESENTED to the Association in 1882 at Southampton an account of
some researches made by means of the bolometer in the infra-red spectrum

formed by a glass prism ; but though these labours have continued with

occasional intermission during the past twelve years, it is, for reasons

which will be explained later, only within the past three years that any

notable advance has been made, and only within the past twelvemonth

that such a measure of success has been attained as justifies the present

communication.

This is not the time to give any historical account of discovery in the

infra-red spectrum, but all those interested in the subject know that the

466 REPORT-- 1894.

first investigator here was Sir William Herschel, whose observations con-
sisted essentially in finding that there was something which the eye could
not see in a region which he proposed to call the ' thermometric spectrum.'
His distinguished son, Sir John, made a curious anticipation of later
discovery, by indicating, though crudely, that this invisible heat was
not uniformly distributed, and a similar conclusion was reached in an
entirely different manner, through the thermopile, by the too-early-l<ist
Melloni. So ignorant, in spite of these investigations, of those of the
elder Draper, and of the elder Becquerel, were we till lately, that when,

quite within my own recollection and that of most of you, Lamansky in

1871 published from his obsei'\'ations with the thermopile a crude little
illustration showing three inequalities in the energy curve, universal

attention was excited by it among those interested in the subject.

    Among other minds, my own then received a stimulus which turned

in this direction, and having, as it seemed to me, exhausted the capacities
of tlie thermopile, I invented an instrument for continuing the research,
which was afterwards called the bolometer, and with which in 1881, at an

altitude of 13,000 feet upon Mount Whitney, I found spectral regions

hitherto unreached, and whose existence had not been suspected.
      I returned with a strong impression of the prospective importance of

this discovery, and laboured at the Alleghany Observatory in improving
all portions of the new method of research, especially of the bolometei' and
its adjuncts, with the twofold object of obtaining greater sensiti\-eness
to heat, and greater precision in fixing the exact point in the spectrum
where the change of heat originated. With the former object such a
degree of sensitiveness was at that time reached, that the bolometer
indicated a change of temperature of yoo otto of '>' degree Centigrade, and
with the latter, such precision, that it was possible to fix the relative
position of a line not merely with a possible error of a considerable
fraction of a degree, such as Lamansky's determination is evidently subject
to, but with a certainty that the error would be within a minute of arc.
The range of the apparatus in wave-lengths was almost unlimited as com-
pared with any other process, and both its sensitiveness and its possible pre-
cision seemed to be at that time notable as compared with previous methods,
for a great advance was made on anything done before with the thermo-
pile, when the presence of the well-known 'D' line of sodium was rendered
sensible (though barely sensible) even as a single line by the change of tem-
perature. This sensitiveness was also, as has been said, accompanied with
the possibility of unusual precision. The results of this labour were laid
before the British Association in the communication already alluded to,
and which exhibited ten or twelve inflections of the curve in the portion till
then almost unknown, which extends from a wave-length of 1" to a
wave-length of nearly 3", at which point the glass prism then used became
wholly opaque to radiation. The positions of these inflections were fixed
with a precision quite impossible to the thermopile, but this exactness was
only obtained in practice by a process so slow as to be almost prohibitory ;
and with this apparatus I made in those earlier years such a number

of observations as I hardly like to recall, so disproportionate did the

labour inherent in this method seem to the final result.
     The justification of this labour seemed to lie in the fact that it does not

appear that photography has ever rendered anything much below a wa\e-

--length of I'' anything at least which has lieen reproduced for publica-

tion in a way which gives confidence that we are in touch with the original.
ON RECENT RESEARCHES IN THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.  407

The processes which involve the use of phosphorescent substances have
given some indications of lines considerably below 1", but it is safe to
state that the work which has just been referred to as communicated to

this Association in 1882 presents almost the only indications which we

have possessed, even up to the present time, about the lower infra-red

solar spectrum.

    Now the curve which was given, even in the later Alleghany observa-

tions, made with the rock-salt prism, contained but a dozen inflections
below the wave-length of l^'S, and these inflections, with their correct
prismatic and wave-length positions, represent, I think, most of our present
knowledge in these regions, even to-day.

     To understand the method by which there were attained, but only at
this great cost of labour, results till then unreached, it may be repeated
that the bolometer had been rendered more sensitive than the thermopile,
but that it was capable of being pointed, and its position in the spectrum
being measured only by a tedious process, which has been exclusively used
till lately (but which that presently to be described advantageously replaces).
Whichever process is used, when the bolometer thread touches a cold line
in the spectrum (since what is black to the eye is cold to it), a larger
current flows through the galvanometer, and the spot of light marking tlie
needle's motion is deflected through a certain number of degrees.

     From this point forward, the new process, whose results I am about to

have the pleasure of bringing before you, differs widely from the old. In

the old, two observers at least are engaged : one, who notes that reading

of the micrometer or of the vernier, which fixes in angular measure the
exact part of the spectral region whence (though nothing is visible) a

thermo-electric disturbance has proceeded ; and another, who simul-
taneously notes through how many divisions of the scale the spot of light
from the galvanometer mirror is deflected by the same electric disturbance.
The process may be compared to a gi-oping in the dark, and it was only by
these means that the considerable inflections of the energy curve much
below the region about 1" were then fixed by the bolometer, by being gone
over again and again with what seemed almost interminable repetition,
and which did in fact call for over a thousand galvanometer readings to
obtain the position and amount of each single inflection of the energv
curve, with the degree of accuracy which was then obtained, and whieli
was shown in the former memoir.

     If it took two years to fix the position of twenty lines by this process,
it would take two hundred years to fix two thousand, supposing they
existed, and it became evident that if the bolometer continued to be the
only means available, new and more effective methods of using it must be

found.

                                     New MetJwds.

     About ten years ago a plan was first studied, which has ever since been
maturing, by means of which this work could be carried on, not only with
far greater rapidity, but with greater certainty, and by an automatic
process. The idea in its original simplicity is very easily understood.

     In the old process, just described, the deflection of a spot of light upon
a scale was read by one observer, while another read simultaneously the
position in the spectrum of the cold band, or line, which caused the thermo-

electric disturbance.

     Now, in imagination, let us take away both the observer at the circle
                                                                                              HH2
--468 REPORT 1894.

and the one at the galvanometer, and in the latter case remove the scale

also, and put in its stead a photographically sensitive plate. As the

needle swings to the right or left the spot of light will trace upon the
plate a black horizontal line whose length will show how far the needle

moves and how great the heat is which originated the impulse. If this
be all, when under an impulse originated by the movement of the spectrum

over the bolometer thread the needle swings a second time, it will go over
the same place ; but if the plate have a uniform vertical movement, pro-

portional to the horizontal movement of the spectrum, the combination of
the two motions of the needle and the plate will write upon the latter a
sinuous curve which will be, in theory at least, the same as the curve
formerly deducible, only with such pains, from thousands of such galvano-

meter readings.

     If we suppose that the movements of the invisible spectrum are con-
trolled by clockwork, so that this spectrum is caused to move uniformly
over the bolometer thread, and that these movements are, by accurate
mechanism, rendered absolutely synchronous with those of the moving
plate, it is clear that we shall be able to readily deduce from the photo-
graphic curve traced on the latter not merely the amount of the heat, but

each particular position in the spectrum of the thread of the bolometer,
which alone can correspond with any given inflection of the curve.

     Thus simple is the theory, but no one had better occasion to know how

difficult the practice would be than myself.
     The researches by the old method and the early attempts to improve

them were interrupted by my acceptance, in 1887, of a position which

implies the administrative charge of different branches of the public
scientific service, and of duties largely incompatible with original re-

search. What time could be spared from these was, however, partly
Anemployed in elaborating the plan of investigation just referred to.

appropriation had been asked of Government for the establishment, on a
modest scale, of an Astro-physical Observatory in Washington, whose first
work should be the investigation of the whole infra-red solar spectrum, by
some means which would open that great region to knowledge. It had
been asked of Government, because it seemed that such knowledge, if
attained, might teach us facts about the sun and the absorption of its rays
by the terrestrial atmosphere, which, there was ground to hope, would
ultimately lead to results of such importance as to justify this national aid.

     These observations were resumed in 1890, on the new system, with the
aid of the Smithsonian Institution which provided larger and more
efficient apparatus, whose design embodied the results of nearly fifteen

 years' study of these subjects.
      Pending the provision of a suitable observatory building, an inadequate

 and temporary one was erected in the Smithsonian Park in Washington,
 to shelter the apparatus presently to be mentioned, with which it was
 designed to commence work, while making provision for more permanent

--scientific quarters which, I may add, are still lacking.

   --The Foucault Siderostat perhaps the most powerful instrument of the

--kind existing was originally made by Sir Howard Grubbof Dublin, from

my indications ; but its dispositions have since been considerably modified.

A beam from its twenty-inch mirror is conveyed through the slit of a

 horizontal collimating telescope having a rock-salt objective of nearly seven-

teen centimetres aperture, and of ten metres focal length, to tlie prism or
grating. The prism is of rock salt, of corresponding dimensions, worked
(by Brashear) with the precision of, and presenting all the external appear-
ance of, one of flint glass. It is mounted on a massive spectro-bolometer
(as the instrument which supports the prism or grating used in producing
the spectrum is called). This instrument includes a large azimuth circle,
over the centre of which the prism is placed ; and it also carries the bolo-
meter, which registers the spectral heat. The focal length of the image-

forming lens, or mirror, is in tliis instrument much greater than in the

Hrst one used, and all parts of the apparatus are correspondingly increased
in size and stability. The most important and novel feature is, however,
the mechanical connection of the large azimuthal circle carrying the prism,
with a distant photographic plate, susceptible of vertical motion, and which
latter takes the place of the scale formerly in front of the remote galvano -
meter, both circle and plate being moved by the same clockwork, which is
of such steadiness and precision as to make the two movements, as far as
possible, perfectly synchronous.

     To fix our ideas, let us suppose that the slow-moving azimuthal circle
carrying the prism revolves through one minute of arc in one minute of
time, in which case the spectrum will move horizontally across the vertical
bolometer thread at a proportional rate. Now, if the same mechanism,
which causes this circular motion of the prism and of the spectrum of one
minute of arc in one minute of time, causes the photographic plate to move
vertically before the galvanometer mirror at the rate of one centimetre of

space in one minute of time -- if there be no allowance to make for changes

of temperature in the prism or for like corrections ; if the mechanician
has done his part in such jierfection that everything works as it should
it obviously follows that, under such conditions, during every second of
this minute a portion of the spectrum represented by the small quantity
of one second of arc will have glided before the bolometer thread, and that
during this same second the plate will have been lifted automatically
through one-sixtieth of a centimetre of space.

     This is one relationship of time and space in actual use here, though

others may be established by the use of the change-wheels with which the
apparatus is provided. The essential thing is that the plate shall show

with great precision, and even on simple inspection, not only the inflections
of the energy curve there written down, but the exact relative position in

the distant spectrum which the bolometer tliread occupied at the moment
it caused the disturbance. In the case assumed, for instance, if we
suppose that the record on the plate commences with the part of the

.spectrum whose angular value is 40°, then, since 1 millimetre corresponds
to 6 seconds of arc, and so on, the existence of an inflection on the plate at

30 cm. 3y'^ mm. would show that the disturbances originated at the point

in the spectruto corresponding to an angular measure of 40° 30' '22"-2.

     If the arm which cari'ies the bolometer is n metres long, and if the

thread of the bolometer is metres in diameter, the angular value of the

--bolometer thread is . At present the linear width of the bolometer

thread is not very materially less than formerly, but it is used with a
longer arm, and its virtual width is accordingly less. In present actual
practice (to use round figures) the optical arm carrying the spectrum

across the  bolometer is 5 metres  in  length                                 and  if  the  bolometer thread
                                                                           ;

be if\y of a millimetre in width, its angular value is evidently xTroVinr ^^ *^*^
I'adius of the circle in which it moves, or a little over two seconds of arc.

When the heat is distributed over so large an area, that part of it which

falls on a thread of given diameter is of course proportionately less, so

that the greater precision of measurement demands a more sensitive con-

struction of the bolometer, as well as a more accurate mechanism for

pointing it. Improvements have accordingly been introduced in the con-

struction of the bolometer, and a need for greater sensitiveness in the

galvanometer has necessarily gone with them. This increased sensitive-

ness has caused increased liability in the latter to both systematic and

accidental perturbations, and the elimination of these has been found the

most formidable difficulty of the whole process. It has been effected largely

by placing the svhole apparatus under constant temperature conditions.

I take pleasure in acknowledging the advantage I have found in

using both Mr. Boys's quartz threads, and the extremely small mirrors

which he, I think, first advocated in connection with the well-known form

of galvanometer due to Lord Kelvin. These and other collective improve-

ments made in the bolometer and in the galvanometer have now made the

former sensitive to changes of temperature in its striji which are demon-

strably less than t-otj^-oo-o ^^ ^ degree Centigrade.
     These are the principal pieces of apparatus, though I should mention

that a method has been found by which the very large salt prisms used

can be preserved in perfect polish while exposed to all the usual casualties

of observation. The actual prism in most frequent use was made from a

block of salt exhibited at the World's Fair by the Russian Government,

and presented to the Smithsonian Institution by its Commissioners. It

is about 18 cm., or over 7 English inches, in height.

Before entering upon a description of the results obtained I desire

permission to speak of the aid I have received from the gentlemen whose

assistance I have been fortunate in securing. First to Dr. Hallock, then

to Professor Hutchins, Mr. Hubbard, and Mr. C. T. Child, and lately to

Mr. F. L. O. Wads worth and Mr. R. C. Child, the imprint of the labours

of the two latter gentlemen being upon almost all the details of the more

recent work.

                                                                 Residts.

     Let us recall that the infra-red spectrum from a rock-salt prism such
as that used is extremely contracted as compared with one from flint glass,
and still more contracted as compared with the wave-length scale. The
portion of the spectrum presented by photography reaches a little below
the band whose wave-length is about 1", and this was asserted by one of

the most eminent living authorities on the subject (Dr. John W. Draper)

when the Avriter commenced this work, fifteen years ago, to be the absolute
end of the heat spectrum. The writer has, however, since carried his
investigations by direct measurement to five or six times this wave-length,
and by indirect measurement much farther still, though what is now
exhibited does not go beyond a wave-length of about 4*". The invisible

heat spectrum of a 60° rock-salt prism through this great wave-length
includes only somewhat less than 2° of arc, ajid the first of these degrees
contains the greater proportion of the energy.

    On referring to the illustrations exhibited to the Association in 1882,

or even to later publications of results obtained by rock-salt prisms, though

ON KECENT RESEARCHLS IN THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.  471

with the old method, it will be seen that there are shown in the latter
publications about a dozen measured inflections of the energy curve below
P'O, and it may be remembered that this curve was obtained only by two

years' assiduous labour.

    We have now befoi-e us (fig. 1, Plate II.) three energy curves, obtained

by the new method, each exhibiting the whole infra-red spectrum under

examination, with about a hundred inflections. These curves are nearly,
but not exactly, similar.

      The three were obtained on the same day, each from an entirely inde-
pendent observation, so that each has given in a fraction of a day many
times the results previously obtained by two years of labour, and, as it will
be later shown, has given these results with a notable gain of accuracy.

     But this is not all. These three curves have been taken with a rapid
movement of the clockwork and a brief swing of the galvanometer, so as
intentionally to suppress all minor inflections and to introduce only the
leading features of the spectrum, as shown in eighty or a hundred of the

leading inflections (lines) or groups.

     This new bolometric method has, however, as will be shown later, a

capacity of resolving these into nearly twenty times that number, the
minor inflections having been thus designedly suppressed here, to better
show the character and position of the principal ones. All these energy
spectra, by the new as by the old method, are, of course, subject to the
slight changes due to invisible clouds constantly passing before the sun,

which, with the change of the sun's altitude, and of the consequent
lengthening path of its rays, prevent any one of them from being exactly

like the other ; while, at the same time, everyone here may satisfy him-

self, by direct inspection of the i-esults before him, that there is scarcely
any single one of their inflections which is not reproduced in the other
two, in exactly the same place, though probably not exactly in the same

degree ; and when we take difierent spectral traces, made at different
hours of the day, and even on different days of the month--traces which

--are absolutely independent of each other and superpose them, experi-

ence shows that we may expect to see such an agreement as that in the
three here chosen at random for illustration, or in the more detailed one,

where the relative probable error is less than one second of arc. Three such

traces only are here given (to prevent confusion), but if we follow these
coincidences through not three, but ten or more plates, we may well judge

(since there seems no possibility here of systematic error) that a result
which all confirm is reliable, and that, on the other hand, a single inflec-
tion on one plate, which the other nine unite in repudiating, is due to
some fortuitous cause.

     But there is still a higher certainty to be obtained, by a method

independent even of comparison or the exercise of judgment. It is
founded on the well-known process of composite-photography, where,

in photographing the successive members of an assemblage of persons,

--having similar general characteristics as of race, character, or educa-

tion, the individual disappears and the normal type alone remains. In
order to apply this method to such results as ours, however, another
step in the process must be introduced, and this is an interesting one, for
the energy curve itself, however valuable, is a comparatively unfamiliar
method of showing variations in the energy, which we are all alike used
to seeing in the visible spectrum, given by linear representations, and not
by a system of inflections.
--472 REPORT 1894.

     In describing this new step which is to give us a linear spectrum, in

addition to the original curve, it will be desirable to also give evidence of

the statement now made, that the present method is capable of recording
far minuter inflections than those shown in the curves exhibited (Plate II),

which, as has just been stated, have been taken only for the purpose of
illustrating such more important features as can be seen and verified by
the audience, and especially for showing the agreement of indeperdent
observations. The evidence of the capacity of the apparatus to show this
detail will best be illustrated by applying our purely thermometric method

Immediately below this curve is the more familiar linear representa-

Nowtion of the same subject.  this linear representation, it is most

important to observe, has been obtained^ not by drawing;, but by the

subsequent application to the curve of an automatic process, by means of

which its  indications are  reproduced  by photogravure, as  separate lines
                                                                                                                             ;

while, by the same automatic process, the most complex spectral curves

can be rendered into their linear equivalents.

I have no space to enter here on a description of this process, further

than to say it is effected by means of a systematically distorted image of

the curve, obtained by a special combination of spherical and cylindric

lenses. You will see, on minute inspection, that the inflections of th&

galvanometer curve have been slightly ' loaded,' to produce a more effec-

tive contrast of light and dark. Except for this, which can in no way

affect the position of a line, but only its intensity, the whole process is as

absolutely automatic as any photograph of the visible spectrum.

This thermograph of the 'D' lines has been chosen to indicate the

grasp of this new thermometric method, by applying it to ihe test of an

object in the visible spectrum with which every physicist is doubtless

familiar. He may then be invited to recall that the distance between the

' D's ' in a rock-salt sixty-degree prism is about eleven seconds of arc, and
to observe that two lines, about half this distance apart, are here shown

as sharply divided by this thermal method as, for instance, are the com-

ponents of the double star a Geminorum by a 3-inch achromatic.

Obviously, then, our method could indicate the existence of two lines,

little, if any, more than one-quarter the distance between the ' D's.'

Lines 3" or less apart can, then, evidently, be indicated l;y tliis method,

even in its present state of development.

    And now, returning to what has been said about the evidence obtain-

able as to the perfect coincidence of these inflections in different energy

curves obtained at different times, and to the consequent evidence that

each inflection so given is real, and not the product of an accidental

variation in the curve, we may conceive that from any number of such

independent curves any number of such linear representations of the

spectra have been obtained ; for example, that ten such linear representa-

Dtions of the whole spectrum as are here given of the ' ' lines only, have

been so found from ten complete energy curves taken on as many diffei'enb

days. From these ten linear representations, by the well-known pro-

cesses of composite photography, one final photograph of the spectrum is

formed, and on this it is evident we may expect to find only what is
permanent and not what is accidental, granting that a rare accident may

have introduced an occasional abnormal deflection.

    Now considering that the part of the infra-red solar spectrum of rock-

salt under review extends through nearly two degrees, or 7,200 seconds,

Dand that we have just seen by the illustration of the ' ' lines (fig. 2)

that lines 3" apart can be thus indicated, we may see for ourselves that at

any rate over 2,000 lines, if they exist, can be mapped. But these lines

do exist, the whole of this new region being apparently as intimately

filled by them as the visible spectrum by the Fraunhofer lines. In f urthey

evidence of this I now show a portion of the lower spectrum (fig. 3,
Plate III.) ' in the comparatively unknown part extending from /\=l^-4 to

communication to this Association, but here resolved into thirty or more

subordinate lines. This illustration includes a part of the new region
discovered on Mount Whitney in 1881, and in the small portion here
exhibited it may be seen that about 200 lines are discriminated.

    I am now trying to bring what may be called the first stage of the

long labour, a portion of which is here described, to a close, this first

stage consisting chiefly in the disco^·ery of and mapping the relative posi-
tions of new spectral lines.

I will only refer to what it seems to me the second part of this work

is likely to be, and to the diSerent kind of interest which may not

improbably belong to it, from that which belongs to this the first.

     "We are thus far in the position of early students of the visible

spectrum, who simply drew the lines they saw without inquiring into

their meaning. Nevertheless, to have discovered and mapped a great

number of these lines is only a beginning, for their real ^alue lies in their

interpretation, and this is still chiefly to come. As to the possible

importance of this interpretation, it is not enough to remind ourselves

tliat three-quarters of the whole energy of the sun exists here and not in

Wetlie upper spectrum,  must remember also that while, as a rule, in the

upper and visible spectrum a great proportion of the lines are caused by

absorption in the solar atmosphere, and a perhaps smaller portion by
telluric absorption ; here, on the contrary, we are led by everything wi;
already know to expect that the great telluric absorptions on which

meteorological predictions and other inniiediately practical interests

depend may be expected to be found, and it is on the comparison of

these energy curves taken at different periods of the year and at different

altitudes of the sun, that those who are engaged in the work see good

cause to hope for important results in the future.

    Before I conclude let me present a collective view of (fig. 4, Plate IV.)

the field in which work has been going on in these later years at the

Smithsonian Observatory on the same scale with the visible spectrum
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

I say ' on the same scale,' meaning not on a wave-length scale which

expands the invisible at the expense of the visible, and not on a prismatic

scale alone which expands the visible at the expense of the invisible, noi'

even on such a logarithmic one as that proposed by Lord Rayleigh, but on

a conventional scale, which I will ask you to tolerate, as- it is simply

meant to show the actual extent and importance of the region covered

here, as compai'ed with that known to Newton. In this illustration, with

which I close my remarks, the mean dispersion throughout the invisible

rock salt spectrum, as far as 4" is taken as the standard, and both spectra

are laid out on that common scale. On the left is the A'isible spectrum
known to Newton : next this is the region known through photography,
now extending a little beyond the band per which marks what, at the time

these researches were commenced, was considei-ed by the then most

"distinguished investigator in the infra-ied, the end of the heat spectrum.

Beyond, and on the right, is a part of the new regions of the spectrum

developed by the bolometer, and of which charts may be shortly expected

on the scale of which a specimen in detail has just been shown.

I cannot close this statement without expressing the gratification with

which I have laid it before the same body that listened to that made on

the same subject twelve years ago, or my sense of my good fortune in

doing so before an audience in which I recognise many of the same
eminent men who so kindly received that first presentation of these

researches.

ON THE FOKMATION OF SOAP-BUliULES.  475

On the Formation of Soap-bubbles by the Contact of Alkaline Oleates
               with Water. By Professor G. Quincke, F.B.S.

                [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.l

80ME years ago I showed that soap-solution could be spread out on
the common surface of oil and water or of oleic acid and water. The
surface tension is diminished by this spreading more than 80 per cent.
The spreading forms vortices in both liquids, and attracts all matter to the
centre of spreading. If the soap-solution is formed by tiie oleic acid in
contact with water containing potassium, sodium, or ammonia on the sur-
face of a drop of oil, suspended in water of the same density, near the

wall of the glass vessel or near viscous substances, the drop of oil is

attracted by the wall or the viscous matter. The formation and the spread-

ing out of soap-solution may be periodical and the movement periodical. If
the period is very short the movement is apparently continuous. Oil-

bubbles filled with water or small bodies covered with very thin films of
oil are displaced in the same manner as oil spheres by the spreading of

soap-solution.

     I think that this new principle of movement will also explain a great
many phenomena in organic nature, and I have tried also to explain by
this new principle the spontaneous formation of emulsion or foam by the
contact of oil (with oleic acid) and alkaline water, the foam -structure and

the motion of the protoplasm in the cells of the plants.
     Very thin films of oil are sufficient to show this motion by periodical

spreading of the solution of very small quantities of soap, so thin and so
small that they cannot be seen with the microscope or recognised in any
other way.

     Recently I have studied the phenomena by the contact of the oleates
of potassium, sodium, and ammonia with water. The neutral oleates are
dissolved by water, and form a viscous liquid. With more water an acid
salt is formed and the alkali is dissolved in the water. These acid salts or

acid soaps are not soluble in water, or only slightly soluble in water. By

longer contact with water they are dissociated, and form again liquid
oleic acid and neutral oleates or soap-solutions.

    When small quantities of neutral oleates are placed in contact with

water between the cover-glass and the slide, and are examined by a micro-
scope with polarised light, they are found to be covered with thin films
of oleic acid. This film dissolves oleate and water, and the diQ"usion of
both substances will bring water to the soap inside the oil-film of oleic
acid, and oleate to the water outside the oil-film. The volume of the soap

inside the oil-film is increased, the soap-solution foi-med on the common
surface of oil and water is spread out, and now the vortices, excited by the
spreading, attract the matter, the soap, and the liquid. In this way are
produced very curious forms called myeline by Virchow, who first observed

--them in putrefied brain. These myeline forms crystals of soap (with

water of crystallisation, covered with the thin oil-films and showing a

--smooth surface) are doubly refractive.

     The ' liquid crystals ' observed by Professor Lehmann, of Karlsruhe, in
fused benzoylcholesterine and fused azoxyanisol are also doubly refracting
crystals, covered with a thin film of oily matter formed in the liquid by

the fusion.
--476
. REPORT 1 894.

    When more water diffuses through the oil-film to the soap inside there

is formed a viscous liquid, a solution of the oleate in a jacket of oleic acid.

The movement of the water and the periodical spreading of soap-solution
will form long filaments or cylinders of viscous matter covered with an
oil-film. The oil-film contracts and forms bubbles in the middle and the

ends of the oil-filament. By the spreading of soap solution the bubbles

wander along the oil cylinders with different velocities and in different
directions. After some time the oil cylinders are deformed and become
strings of beads of oleic acid and thin oil- films. The thin oil-films form
foam or bubbles filled with water or weak solution of soap.

     In the oil-film are distributed lenses or spheres of oil filled with strong

or weak soap-solution. Some methylene-blue dissolved in the water is
collected or stored up in the oleic acid, so that the coloured oil and the
water may be very easily distinguished.

     The spheres of oleic acid coloured with methylene-blue are arranged on
the edges of the films of the bubbles or spherical films of the foam, and the
appearance is similar to the appearance presented by the stars of the
Milky Way. The formation of chains of stars, as observed by Professor

Max Wolf, and the spiral nebula in Perseus in the excellent photographs

of Dr. Roberts, are similar in appearance to the phenomena observed by

me in these microscopical oil-films and bubbles.

      Fifty years ago Plateau pointed to the analogy of the rotation of the
sun and the planets with the rotation of oil-spheres suspended in a mixture

of alcohol and water of the same density. Now we have a new analogy

between the arrangement of matter of the universe by forces acting at

very great or very small distances. From the standpoint of our modern
physics, with the Newtonian law of gravitation and the law of action of
molecular forces, these analogies may appear to be somewhat arbitrary. But
we must be able to pass from definite distances to infinitely great or to infi-
nitely small distances of the acting masses, and we can conceive that it
may be possible that the difference between the law of gravitation and the
law of the molecular forces may disappear, and that we may have the
same law for small and great distances ; so that the distribution of matter
may be accounted for by the same forces, when the masses and the

distances of the masses are increased in the same proportion, a million or

 a billion times.

      The work of future generations will decide whether researches on the
 microscopical oil-foam or on the stars of the universe will give the solution

 of this problem.

Oil the Displacements of the Eotational Axis of the Earth. Bij Professor

        W. FoRSTER, Director of the Royal Ohser calory of Berlin.

                 [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxtcnso.']

Displacements of the rotational axis of the earth with reference to fixed
directions in space have been observed since the earliest ages of astro-
nomical measurement ; for such displacements, visible in wanderings of
the pole of the apparent diurnal rotation of the celestial sphere among the
constellations of fixed stars, exist in such enormous amplitudes, that in
their main features they could be detected by the aid of very simple
apparatus and observations.
    ox DISPLACEMENTS OF THE ROTATIONAL AXIS OF THE EARTH. 477

     The true law and explanation of these wanderings of the pole remained,
nevertheless, a deep mystery till Copernicus lifted the veil by showing
that they were only the celestial image of real displacements of the
rotational axis of the earth in space, and until Newton came and, com-

bining his discovery of universal gravitation with his deduction of the
ellipsoidal figure of the earth, proved that these displacements are due to

the actions of the moon and the sun on the earth.
     The mathematicians of the eighteenth century completed this explana-

tion by profound researches embracing the full theory of free rotation of a
solid system of masses, under the action of various disturbing influences,
not only those acting from outwards on the rotating body (as in the case
of the sun's and the moon's attractions on the earth), but also those
depending upon the condition or changes within the rotating system

itself.

    Among several interesting results, these investigations pointed out an

essential difference between the development of the disturbed rotation in

the first and in the second case.
      Ul3on the supposition, corresponding to the real terrestrial conditions

of the problem, namely, that all the disturbing influences are relatively

small in comparison with the amount of energy represented by the primary
rotation of the earth itself, the following distinctions were demonstrated.

      Exterior disturbing influences will mainly produce displacements of

the axis in space, and corresponding wanderings of the pole among the

stars ; whilst the simultaneous displacements of the axis in the earth itself,
in consequence of the particular conditions of their evolution, remain

insensible.

     On the contrary, interior conditions and distui'bing influences, as those

contained in the configurations of the masses, or in changes of the dis-
tribution of the masses composing the rotating system, will mainly produce
displacements of the rotational axis in the rotating body itself, whilst in
this case the simultaneous displacements of this axis in space and the

corresponding variations of the position of the pole among the stars remain

insensible.

     Very soon after these deductions had been made from theory, astro-

--nomers began to inquire if also effects of the latter type that is to say,
--displacements of the rotational axis in the earth really existed.

     According to theory, such displacements ought even to exist when the

distribution of the masses composing the earth is not in the slightest

 degi'ee variable.

      It is sufficient for producing such displacements that the position of
the rotational axis of the earth is actually not in perfect coincidence with

one of its principal axes of inertia, known as the principal axis.
      The slightest deviation of tlie rotational axis from the principal axis

has the consequence that the pole of the rotational axis begins and con-
tinues to describe a small circle around the pole of the principal axis.

      The velocity of this movement depends upon the law of the figure and
of the distribution of the masses composing the earth, and the best
 numerical data for this dependence had given the result that the dis-
 placement in question would probably have a period of nearly ten months.

     Now all such displacements, possibly measurable with reference to

 fixed directions in the earth, and insensible with reference to fixed direc-
 tions in space, could be found in the most favourable way by measuring
 as exactly and continuously as possible the distance of the pole from the
                                                                             ----

zenith of the observer's station ; in other words, by repeated determinations
of geographical latitudes. But, notwithstanding very long and refined
determinations of the geographical latitudes at some of the principal
observatories, beginning shortly before the middle of the present century,
only very uncertain and discordant traces of the phenomena in question

were found.

    The reason for this want of success is now very clear. Astronomers

had limited their researches too narrowly to the last-mentioned type

namely, to the supposed regular ten-monthly periodical movement of the
pole of the rotational axis around the pole of the principal axis. Too

easily it had been admitted that all the existing variations of the distri-
bution of terrestrial masses were far too small for altering sensibly the

position of this principal axis itself.

     It was Lord Kelvin, at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association
(1876), who first drew the attention of the scientific world to the con-
sideration of the great natural transports of masses of air and water, and

of various masses by the water, going on continuously and periodically in

the form of currents and circulations of different kinds, as well in the
atmosphere as in oceans and I'ivers, and the effects of the enormous

periodical deposits of snow and ice. He showed that these very consider-

able variations of the distribution of masses on the earth could not only

produce sensible displacements of the principal axis of inertia, but that

such displacements of this axis could have an amplifying effect on the

total amount of displacements of the x'otational axis.

     For if the principal axis were itself not in a constant position, the
theoretically required movement of the rotational axis around the principal

axis would become a very complicated movement, differing entirely from

the simple form which to that time had appeared in the researches of

astronomers.

     This epicyclic character of the movement of the pole of the rotational

axis could considerably modify not only the length of the period, but also

the whole geometrical character and amplitude of the curve, in such a way

that in longer periods epochs of very small variations of latitude could

alternate with epochs of considerably increased variations of latitude.

Possibly, as a further consequence of this complication of the displacements

of the two axes, and as a consequence of the still existing plastic state of

certain parts of the earth, as well as by the damping effects of the fluid

--parts, even ])rogressive though very slow and unsteady progressive

displacements of the rotational axis in the earth could still result.

The  field  of     this  research  was  thus  decisively  cleared  by  Lord  Kelvin
                                                                                                              ;

and finally, about four years ago, by the co-operation of some Observatories

with the International Geodetic Union, clear evidence was obtained, and

in the last three years, with the aid of an expedition sent by the Inter-

national Union to Honolulu, decisive proofs of such displacements have
been found. I consider it a special honour and pleasure to be enabled to

submit some of the newest results of this international co-operation to a

meeting of the same Association which, twenty years ago, had been witness

of the almost prophetic assertions of one of its most illustrious members

regarding the real conditions of this important phenomenon.

I have prepared a diagram showing these newest results. In this

diagram is given a representation of the wanderings of the pole of tlie

rotational axis of the earth on its surface during the last twenty months,

from October 20, 1892, to May 1, 1894.

    ON DISPLACEMENTS OF THE ROTATIONAL AXIS OF THE EAKTH. 479

     This sketch is founded on nearly 6,000 single determinations of latitude

made in the Observatory of Kasan (Eastern Russia), Strassburg, Elsass
(41° 21' west of Kasan), and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (124° 30' west of
Kasan). The observations are condensed in twenty monthly mean results,
numbered from zero to 1 9. Every one of these resulting monthly positions
of the pole indicated by the centres of the small circles is thus tho
mean result of about 300 single determinations.

     The figure is drawn on the scale of two millimetres to one-hundredth

of a second of arc, and the maximum amplitude of the curve is nearly

tifty-hundredths, or half a second. The amplitude of these movements of
the pole on the surface of the earth is between 40 and 50 feet.

     The general character of the movement is quite in accordance with
what has been mentioned concerning its complicated and somewhat spiral

character. The sense of the motion is from west to east. The velocity is
apparently very variable, and it seems as if we are now approaching an
epoch in which the amplitude is considerably diminishing. It is also
evident that such a character of movement can very easily produce slow
progressive motions, and for this reason the whole phenomenon wants to
be watched incessantly and very carefully.

     The astronomers and geodetists who are now associated in the Inter-
national Geodetic Union have invited geologists to associate with them
in this common research. Such an international organisation will be also

useful and almost indispensable for a great part of the work of astronomical

observatories.

     It is to be hoped that Great Britain will now participate in this

International Union, embracing all other civilised nations. Such organisa-
tions, with their clear and reasonably limited aims, involve not only real
economies and refinements of mental work, combined with diminutions of
material expenses, but it is hoped that they will also have great importance

as slowly growing foundations of human and terrestrial solidarity.

A Lechtre-room Experiinent to illustrate Fres7iel's Diffraction Theori/

          and Babinefs Principle. Bij Professor A. CoRNU, F.R.S.

                  [Orrlered by the General Committee to be printed in cxtcnso.^

The diffraction fringes bordering the shadow of an object illumined by a

 point of light present us with one of the most striking phenomena in

 optics.

      Dr. Thomas Young was the first to connect these fringes with the
 wave theory. According to him they were due to the interference of
 the direct wave with the wave tangentially reflected at the surface of the

 body screening the light.

      Fresnel, following the way opened by Young, proved, however, by a

 very simple experiment, namely, by the identity of the fringes produced
 by the edge and by the back of a razor, that the reflected light has no

 appreciable influence on the production of these fringes. He proved that

 the phenomenon is exclusively due to the mutual interference of all the
 vibrations proceeding from the whole of the wave not intercepted by

 the object.

    A mathematical investigation, and even a superficial analysis, shows

 that the resulting vibratory motion producing the fringes is equivalent to
 the vibration which would be caused by a permanent wave fixed at the
 edge of the body screening the light, provided that the acting part of this

 wave is reduced to a small breadth variable according to the obliquity of

 the rays. Consequently, everything happens as if the source of light
 were taken away, and the body were surrounded by a true luminous
  source forming a sort of border round its apparent contour. This result,
 proved for a single luminous point, is immediately extended to a circular
 source of light of any diameter considered as composed of points acting
  independently.

        This optical equivalence is not only a symbolic or geometrical result,

 but a real physical fact, and the experiment, which I propose to show,
  gives the most striking evidence of the reality of this source of light.

To show the acting part of the wave surrounding the screening body

three conditions are required :

1. The plane of distinct vision must be made to coincide with the

edge of the diffracting body.

pi'oducing the phenomenon.

3. The rays not employed in producing the phenomenon must be

cut off.

      It is not difficult to realise experimentally these three conditions, and
the result obtained is extremely brilliant with sunlight. Though much

less intense with the electric arc, it is nevertheless sufhciently distinct to

be projected. With a feeble source of light, such as an oil-lamp, the
phenomenon is still quite visible, but only by direct vision.

      Let us take a luminous source of circular form (the disc of the sun or
a circular hole in a diaphragm conveniently illuminated). Let the rays
diverging from this source fall upon an achromatic lens (0'5 to 1 metre
focal length) and produce at the conjugate focus a bright circular image
of the .source. Exactly at this focus let us place a black circular disc
having precisely the same diameter as this image.

     The eye placed behind this opaque disc will not see any point of the
luminous source, because all the rays are cut off by the disc ; it will
perceive, however, a luminous line round the edge of the lens. This is
in itself an illustration of the acting part of the Fresnel's wave, for the
edge of the lens is really a screen which intercepts the incident wave.
But the experiment becomes extremely striking if any object is put on
the surface of the lens : this object appears on a dark field as if surrounded
by a luminous line following even the smallest details of its edge. [In the
experiment projected before the Section the object shown was a branch

of fern.]

Moreover, each particle of the unavoidable dust lying on the lens pro-

duces a luminous point, and for this reason the field is never quite dark.

Lycopodium thrown in front of the lens exaggerates this effect and

produces a sort of luminous nebula.

The intensitv of the bright bordering line depends upon the accuracy

·with which the circular screen masks the focal image of the source ; if
the diameter of the screen is too small the field becomes luminou.s, if it is

too large the brilliancy of the line diminishes. If another shape be given

to the screen the luminous line is interrupted normally to the directions

in which the screpn extends much outside the image of the source.

With the circular screen it is easy to observe the important particular

case to which Babinet called attention, viz., that a very thin opaque line
diffracts light exactly in the same manner as a transparent slit of the

same form and size.

     It suffices for this purpose to observe the shadows of successive wires,
straight or curved, of decreasing diameters. The dark space lying between

the two luminous edges in the case of a thick wire diminishes as the wire

becomes finer, and vanishes when its apparent angle becomes sufficiently

small ; then the wire appears on the dark field like the incandescent

filament of a glow-lamp.

     The slits corresponding to the wires are made with lines of decreasing
breadths traced on smoked glass. The appearances are exactly the same

as before, a double bright line being produced by a broad slit, a single

bright line by a narrow slit, so that a fine transparent .slit and a fine

opaque wire give exactly the same phenomenon. This is the simple and
useful result called sometimes Babioiefs Principle, and, in any case, the
experiment just described gives immediately the means of verifying

whether the conditions required for the coriect application of this principle

are sufficiently fulfilled.

     All these results can be collected under a pretty form which illustrates

one of the finest natural phenomena. It is well known that when the

sun is hidden behind the top of a mountain, but near the crest, all objects
in its neighbourhood are surrounded by luminous borders, and minute
objects, branches, leaves of trees, flying birds, &c., appear on the sky as

if incandescent.

     To imitate this appearance it suffices to cut out in cardboard an

irregular edge representing the crest of the mountain, and to border it

with some blades of grass or moss representing trees. This object placed

on the lens reproduces an image of this beautiful phenomenon, which

seems to have been observed many centuries ago in deep valleys when the

Hesun rises ; for Shakespeare says {Richard II., act iii. scene 2) : '  fires

the proud tops of the eastern pines.'

The Connection between Chemical Comhination and' the Discharge of

    Electricity through Gases. By J. J.^Thomson, Professor of Experi-

     mental Physics, Cambridge.

                [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.^

Thk intimate connection between chemical change and the passage of

electricity through liquids has been universally recognised ever since

Faraday discovered the laws of electrolysis which bear his name. These

laws state that, whenever electricity passes through an electrolyte, che-

mical changes take place in the electrolyte, and that the quantity of electri-

city which passes through the electi'olyte is connected in the most intimate

and simple manner with the amount of chemical change which has taken

place during its passage. For each unit of electricity which passes through

the electrolyte a definite amount of chemical change takes place, and the

chemical changes which take place when equal quantities of electricity

pass through different electrolytes are chemically equivalent. But althougli

chemists have largely availed themselves of the light thrown by electrolysis

on chemical phenomena, the subject of the passage of electricity through

Wegases does not seem to have attracted their attention.  have strong

evidence, however, that the connection between the discharge of electricity

through gases and chemical change is not lees intimate than that between

electrolysis and chemical change. Thus, for example, when the electric dis-

charge passes through steam, the steam is decomposed, an excess of hydro-

gen appearing at one electrode and an excess of oxygen at the other ; these
excesses of hydrogen and oxygen are proportional to the quantity of elec-

tricity which has passed through the steam, and are equal to the amounts

of hydrogen and oxygen which would be liberated if the same quantity of

electricity passed through a water voltameter. AVe have here evidence

for connecting chemical action with the discharge of electricity through

gases of precisely the same kind as that wJiich has connected it with

electrolysis. Again, as I hope to show later in this paper, the passage of

electricity througli gases is influenced by various circumstances, such as
the presence of very small quantities of water vapour, which exert so
strange an effect upon chemical combination.

    As for the opportunities for the study of chemical problems given by
the phenomena of gaseous discharge, they seem to excel even those

afforded by electrolysis, for the substances are in the gaseous state, the
state in which the properties are the simplest and have been the most
closely studied, while the visibility of the discharge facilitates the study
of the electric phenomena, as it allows us to see, to some extent at least,
what is going on.

     The first point by which I shall illustrate the connection between
chemical action and the discharge through gases is the influence exerted
by water vapour on the potential difference required to initiate a spark
through gas. The researches of Dixon, of Pringsheim, and of Baker, have
established that water vapour exerts a remarkable influence on chemical
combination. In several typical cases the presence of water seems indis-
pensable for chemical action ; two perfectly dry gases, even when they
have as strong an affinity for each other as hydrogen and chlorine, seem
utterly unable to combine with each other. The addition of a little water,

liowever, is all that is necessary to cause combination to take place. As
an analogue to this I shall now show some experiments which prove that

it is extremely difficult to start a spark through a perfectly dried gas.

When all traces of moisture are abstracted from the gas, the gas is able

to withstand without sparking a potential difference many times more

than that which would be sufficient to spai'k through it if it were slightly
moist. The experiments suggest that, if it were possible to get a perfectly
dry gas, then to spark through it would require so large a potential dif-
ference as to be far beyond any means of production at present at our
command.

     The experiments are of the following kind. The ends of a coil of wire
are attached to a and b (fig. 1), the outside coatings of two Leyden jars,
the insides of which ai'e connected to the terminals of a Wimshurst elec-

trical machine, or of an induction coil. When sparks pass between the

terminals of the machine electric oscillations are started, and we have

electric currents of very high frequency passing to and fro through the

wires connecting the coatings of the jars. By using jars of suitable size

it is easy to send through the coil electrical currents which reverse their
dii'ection several million times per second. This coil, with the alternating

currents passing through it, may be compared to the primary of an induc-

tion coil, and it will induce currents in any neighbouring conductor. If

we place inside the coil a bulb containing some gas at a very low pressure,

the gas will be subject to electro-motive forces due to the electro-magnetic
induction of the alternating currents in the coil ; if these forces are very

intense, they may be sufficient to cause a luminous discharge to pass through

the gas. This discharge will take a ring shape, since the electro-motive
force due to the alternating currents in the coil will act round rings pa-

rallel to the plane of tlie turns of the coil. I now place in the coil this bulb,

which contains gas wliich has not been specially dried, and you see that
the ring discharge flashes through the bulb whenever sparks pass between

the terminals of the Wimshurst machine. I will now use this arrangement

to show the effect of drying the gas, remarking in passing that the effect
of moisture is not confined to any particular method of producing the elec-
tro-motive force, and is just as marked when the E.M.F. is steady as when

                                                                                                           I i2

it is alternating ; in fact, I first noticed the effect when using a battery

made up of a very large number of storage cells.

The apparatus consists of two equal bulbs, connected by a glass tube,

which is open originally but afterwards fused up : one of the bulbs

contains carefully prepared phosphorus pentoxide, the other is empty of

all but gas. The two bulbs were exhausted by an air-pump until the

pre.ssure of the gas in them was very low. They were then sealed off from

the pump, and the passage between the bulbs was fused up. In this way

the two bulbs are  filled with  the  same kind of  gas at the same pressure
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the gas in one bulb will, however, gradually become dry, while that in the

other will I'emain in its original damp condition. Just after the opening

between the bulbs was fused up, the discharge passed freely through either

bulb when placed inside the coil. After the apparatus had stood for some

                                     Fig. 1.

                   e9

days lon» enough for the gas in the bulb containing the phosphorus pent-
oxide to become dry, the two bulbs showed a marked difference in their
behaviour when placed inside the coil. The discharge, as you see, still

passes freely in the damp bulb ; but not the faintest trace of discharge can
be detected inside the dry one, and even when the distance between the
terminals of the Wimshurst machine is increased far beyond that neces-
sary to produce a discharge in the damp bulb, the dry bulb still remains

free from dischar<^e. It is thus evident that, to start a discharge in the

dry <'as, a much larger electro-motive force is required than is necessary to
produce the same effect in the damp gas ; in other words, the presence of

aqueous vapour facilitates to a great extent the passage of tlie discharge.

      If however, I produce a brush discharge in the dry bulb by bringing

to the outside of the bulb a wire connected with the high potential pole

of the Wimshurst machine, the ring discharge will start at once in the
dry bulb, and after it has once been started an electro-motive force, very

mucli smaller than that which it withstood previously without giving way,

is sufficient to send the discharge through it. In fact, when once the

discharge has been started through the dry gas it is almost as easy to send

the consecutive discharges through the dry gas as through the damp. If

the dry bulb is put away and left alone, it will, after some time, recover

its original strength. It takes, however, a considerable time to do this,

and it is very often several hours before the bulb is restored to its original

condition. The effect of depriving the gas of aqueous vapour is thus to

inci-ease the difficulty of getting the first spark to pass through the gas.

After once the spark has passed, there is very much less difference between

the dry and the wet gas. If, instead of these alternating currents, we use

the dii'ect current from a large battery of cells, we can easily measure the

change in the potential difference required for the first and consecutive

sparks                         all we have to do is to connect the electrodes of  a discharge  tube
                            ;

with an electrostatic-voltmeter. For damp gases the change in the poten-

tial difference between the first and following sparks is not very great. For

very dry gases, however, the potential difference required to start the

first spark may be quite indefinitely large ; but for the second and follow-

ing sparks it will be almost identical with that for the damp gas.

Another striking effect produced by aqueous vapour is the change it

produces in a phosphorescent glow which some gases emit after an electric

discharge has passed through them. When the discharge passes through

oxygen it is followed by a greenish yellow glow diffused through the bulb.

This glow is \'ery bright and lasts for a considerable time. It gives a con-

tinuous spectrum crossed by a few bright lines. When the discharge

passes through cyanogen it is succeeded by a white glow which is very

persistent, lasting in some cases for fifteen or twenty minutes. All tLr

gases in which I have observed this glow have the power of forming poly-

meric modifications. Aqueous vapour produces a very marked effect on

this glow. If an oxygen bulb is sealed up with some phosphorus pent-

oxide, then for a short time after sealing off the gas will glow brightly

after a discharge has passed, but as the gas gets drier the glow gets fainter,

and after a few days is hardly visible. On the other hand, air, which only

shows a very faint glow when moist, gives quite a bright glow when care-

fully dried. This glow is of the same character as that in damp oxygen.

The way in which the presence of water vapour facilitates the discharge

and affects its appearance may be compared with its effect on chemical

combination. Dixon, Pringsheim, and Baker have shown that certain

--typical combinations do not take place at all unless water vapour is pre-

sent. If we take the view which is, I think, proved by the phenomena

--accompanying electric discharges through gases that the first discharge

through a gas in its normal state is accompanied by the splitting up of

some of the molecules of the gas, we can see why a cause which increases

the facility with which the first discharge passes through the gas should also

increase the tendency of the gas to enter into chemical combination. The

forces holding together the atoms in a molecule are so great that if we

were to take a single molecule of a gas by itself the electric field required

to pull the atoms in the molecule asunder would far exceed in intensity any

hitherto applied to a gas. For consider two atoms in a molecule each

charged with the quantity of electricity which the electrolysis of liquids

shows is carried by each atom of an electrolyte, and which from the results

of experiments of the electrolysis of steam we may infer is carried by an

atom of a gas. This charge, which we shall call e, is of the order 10~" in
486 REPORT-- 1894.

electrostatic units. If r is the distance between the atoms in the molecule,

the force on unit charge at one of the atoms due to the other is e/r'-. If

we take r equal to  10"*, this  force  is  equal  to  10              To pull the atoms
                                                                  '.

apart would require a force comparable with this. As a force of 10* in

C.G.S. units corresponds to thirty million volts per centimetre, we see that

to separate the atoms in a molecule would require the application of an

electric force far transcending in intensity any hitherto applied to a gas.

A single molecule or a system of molecules free from each other's action

would, therefore, not be split up by the fields which are found to produce

discharge through gases. Such fields, however, might produce discharge

if there existed in the gas complex molecules from which the charged

atoms could be more easily detached than from isolated molecules. The

formation of these aggregates or large molecules with but loose connec-

tion between the atoms would on this view be an essential preliminary to

the passage of the dischai-ge. The presence of a third substance, such as

water, may facilitate the formation of these aggregates by supplying nuclei

round which they may condense. Indeed, a direct proof of the electrical

eflfect exerted by water on the surrounding gas is indicated by the electri-

fication produced when drops of water fall on a plate.' The most direct

explanation of this phenomenon is that when a drop of water is surrounded

by gas there is a finite difference between the potential of the gas and that

of the water ; in other words, there is electrical separation at the surface
of the drop resulting in the formation of a coating formed of two layers of

electricity close together, one of these layers being positive, the other

negative. If the gas surrounding the drop is oxygen, the inner layer is

positive, the outer negative ; while if the drop is surrounded by hydrogen,

the inner layer is negative, the outer one positive. Thus in a system con-

sisting of water and gas effects take place which result in an electiical

separation which becomes apparent when the drop receives such a com-

paratively trifiing disturbance as that produced by falling on a plate.

Water is, with the single exception of mercury, the liquid where the

electrification by drops attains the greatest dimensions. It is also the

substance that, as far as our present knowledge extends, produces the

greatest effect both on the electric discharge and on chemical combination.

As the electrification is carried by atoms, and as these can be separated

by the splashing of the drops on the plate, the electrification of drops

furnishes independent evidence of the ability of water to put the surround-

ing gas into a condition in which some of the atoms are but loosely attached

together. Although in this case the phenomenon is observed with liquid

drops of a finite size which we cannot suppose to have any pei/manent

existence in those cases where a trace of aqueous vapour produces such

an effect on the passage of electricity and on chemical combiiiation, yet,

if we realise this action of drops, we shall, I think, get a clue to the ex-

planation of the action of small quantities of aqueous vapour. For let us

suppose that we have a drop of water in air with its double layer of elec-

trification, and that this drop for some reason or another evaporates.

Blake's experiments show that the steam from this drop is not electrified,

so that if we proceed to the limit and suppose all the water to evaporate,
the charged atoms constituting the double layer will still be left, and we

shall have a number of oppositely charged atoms held together by very

loose ties. These would easily be split up themselves by the electric field,

or would form excellent nuclei for the formation of loosely attached systems

Aof molecules suitable for conveying the electric discharge.  quantity of

water vapour alternately condensing and evaporating would throw the

surrounding gas into a state in which it could transmit the electric dis-

charge. This would be the case even though the existence of the drops

was so transitory that the water was to all appearance continually in the

form of vapour. That some drops should be formed, having a very brief

existence it is true, even when the pressure of the water vapour is far

below that of saturation, is what we should expect on almost any dynamical

theory of evaporation. The effect of the drops in promoting the existence

of free atoms would of itself tend to increase the likelihood of their

formation, as we know from the experiments of R. v. Helmholtz and

E-icharz that condensation is much facilitated by the presence of free ions.

Thus, a small quantity of aqueous vapour, portions of which, occasionally

condensed for an instant into drops, might put some of the gas into a con-

dition approaching dissociation, inasmuch as in this condition the atoms

Wecould easily be detached from each other.  might expect that when in

this state the gas might enter into chemical combinations much more freely

than before this dissociation took place. The effect of a drop of water on

a molecule consisting of a positively electrified atom combined with a nega-

tively electrified one near the surface of the drop is worthy of considera-

tion. Pure water, though not a conductor, has yet such a high specific

inductive capacity that its electrostatic effect is much the same as if it

were a conductor. Now if we have a molecule consisting of a positively

electrified atom. A, with a charge -f e and a negatively electrified atom, B,

--with a charge e, on or near the surface of a conducting sphere, the effect

of the electrification induced on the sphere is the same as if we had at

AA' a point on the same radius as inside the sphere, and close to the sur-
--face a negative charge equal to e, and at B' a point inside the sphere

close to the surface and on the same radius as B a positive charge equal
to +e- Now, the negative charge at A' will almost neutralise at B the

force arising from the positive charge at A, while the effect of the charge

at B' on B is along the radius at B, and thus has no effect parallel to the

surface of the sphere ; there would thus be nothing to oppose the motion

Aof B away from A, and similarly of away from B, as long as this motion

took place parallel to the surface of the sphere. Thus, for movements of

this kind the molecule would be dissociated by the presence of the sphere
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

this dissociation of the gas would facilitate the production of the elec-

trification over its surface, also its tendency to enter into chemical com-

bination.

   We have hitherto been considering the passage of electricity through

the gas. If we proceed to study the passage of electricity from a gas to a

metal, we shall find that it is also facilitated by the presence of a third

substance. This effect was very well shown in an experiment which I had

occasion to make on the discharge of electricity through mercury vapour.

A bulb for the discharge was prepared by taking a large closed vessel filled

with freshly distilled mercury ; this was connected by a glass tube to the

discharge bulb ; one end of a capillary tube was fused to this bu'b, tne other

end dipped under mercury. When the mercury in the large vessel was

heated, the arrangement acted like a mercury distiller and pumped itself :

to hasten matters, however, as much air as possible was taken out of the

arrangement by an air-pump before beginning the distillation. The ap-

paratus was kept distilling for a whole day, the discharge tube being sur-
 488 REPORT-- 1894.

 rounded by a furnace and kept so hot that the glass was just on the point
 of softening ; at the end of the day the discharge tube was sealed off,
  enough mercury having been run into a reservoir connected with it to
 cover up the two electrodes by means of which the discharge enters and
 leaves the tube, and also to form a large pool at the bottom, under which
 was an electrode connected with the earth. The bulb was allowed to cool
 to the temperature of the room, and then a discharge was sent thruugh it
 from a high-tension transformer. The discharge presented a peculiar ap-
 pearance, jjassing as a narrow well-defined band of light between the two
 electrodes : it was started only after great difficulty. After the discharge
 .stopped, the mercury vapour in the bulb was found to be positively electri-
 fied, and this electrification had great difficulty in getting out of the gas ; for
 although the two mercury electrodes which had been used as terminals and
 the large pool of mercury at the bottom of the bulb were connected with the
 earth, there was such electrification left in the bulb fifteen minutes after
 the discharge had ceased, that when the bulb was disconnected from the
 earth and connected with a quadrant electrometer, the spot of light re-

flected from the mirror was driven right off the scale. When the discharge

 passed through mercury vapour from which other gases had not been

driven with so much care, there was a residual positive electrification, but

 this disappeared so quickly after the discharge stopped, that after a
 minute it was too slight to affect appreciably the electrometer. This ex-
periment shows that the communication of electricity from a gas to a

metal, in this case from mercury vapour to liquid mercury, is very much
facilitated by the presence of a third substance.

     The well-known chemical phenomenon that many chemical reactions

do not take place unless the temperatui-e exceeds a certain value, is also
paralleled by one in the discharge of electricity through gases. Certain

gases, such as iodine, when strongly heated, allow electricity to pass through
them with considerable facility ; this, however, is only possible when the
electrodes which carry the current into the gas are also at a high tempera-
ture. If we dip a piece of cold platinum foil between the electrodes when

the current is passing through the hot gas, the current is immediately
stopped apparently to as great an extent as if a piece of mica or other
non-conducting substance had been inserted between the electrodes ; as
soon, however, as the piece of platinum foil gets to a dull red heat the cur-

rent between the electrodes recommences, and the platinum now offers but

little obstacle to the passage of the current.

     The electro-motive force required to liberate the ions from an electrolyte
is connected in a very intimate way with the amount of work required to
effect the chemical change which occurs when one unit of electricity passes

through the electrolyte. Similarly, we may expect from the study of the

potential difference required to send an electric discharge through a gas,
to derive information about the work required to effect the chemical

changes which go on when the discharge passes through the gas ; as these
changes seem often to consist in the splitting up of molecules into atoms,
the study of the potential difference might be expected to throw light on
the amount of work required to split the molecules of a gas up into atoms.

Systematic measurements of the potential difference required to produce

discharge have been made by several observers ; they all, however, show
one featui-e, which, until it is investigated, makes the deduction of conclu-
sions as to the work required to effect the changes in the gas impossible.
This feature is well illustrated in an experiment described by Hittorf, its
ON CHEMICAL COMBINATION AND ELKCTRIC DISCHARGE. 489

discoverer. Hittorf measured the fall of potential in a vacuum tube, not

merely between the electrodes but also along the whole length of tube, and

found the very remarkable and interesting result that by far the greater

part of the total fall in potential occurred close to the cathode. Thus in

one of his experiments on hydrogen at a pressure oi about yjrirth of a
millimetre of mercuiy he found tliat, of the total fall in potential, about

   occurred close to the cathode, the potential gradient in the rest of the

jl

tube only amounting to two or three volts per centimetre. The question

immediately suggests itself whether, if we got rid of the electrodes alto-

gether, we should reduce the potential difierence to one-sixth or so of the

value required when electrodes are used. I have here an experiment which

is intended to settle this point ; the apparatus consists of two bulbs con-

nected together by an open tube, so that the bulbs are always filled with

the same kind of gas at the same pressure. One bulb is without electrodes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the other, whose diameter is approximately equal to the circumference of

the first, is provided with electrodes which are placed at the opposite ends

of a diameter ; these electrodes are connected with a wire which makes one
turn round the coil which connects the outsides of the two Ley den jars

(fig. 1) ; the bulb without electrodes is placed inside this coil ; the total
electro-motive force acting round the bulb without electrodes is thus ap-

proximately the same as that acting between the electrodes of the other

bulb. Setting the Wimshurst machine in action, and gradually increasing

the length of the spark until a spark passes, it is found that the discharge

begins to appear at about the same time in each of the bulbs, showing that

the total electro-motive force required to produce discharge is not very dif-

ferent in the two cases, and that the potential difierence required to start

a discharge through a given length of gas is not very greatly inci'eased by

Wethe presence of electrodes.  may, therefore, conclude that the potential

differences measured in the tube with electrodes are primarily connected

with work required to split up the gas thi'ough which the discharge passes.

Resistance of Rarefied Gases.

Rarefied gases are exceedingly good conductors of electricity when

they are acted upon by electro-motive forces sufficiently intense to produce

A Bdischarges. This is cleai'ly shown by the following experiment.
                               and

(fig. 2) are two coils in series placed in circuit with the outer coatings of

Atwo Leyden jars. In coil an exhausted bulb is placed ; this bulb serves as

a kind of galvanometer, the brightness of the ring in it giving an indica-

tion of the current passing through the coil A. The substance whose re-

sistance is to be tested is placed in a bulb inside the other coil ; the cur-
rents induced in this bulb will, by their inductive action, exert on the

primary coil an electro-motive force in the opposite direction to the current

in the coil ; this will tend to stop the current, and we shall detect its effect

by the diminution in brightness of the discharge in the bullj inside A.

The extent of this diminution will give us a clue to the magnitude of the

B Bcurrents induced in the bulb
                               (fig. 2). I place inside the coil  a

bulb containing gas at a low pressure. You notice that the discharge in

A is quite extinguished. I now replace this bulb by one of the same size

filled with sulphuric acid and water in the proportions for which they con-

duct electricity best. You observe that the sulphuric acid in B does not

Adiminish the brilliancy of the discharge in to anything like the extent

the exhausted gas did ; thus the currents passing through the gas are
--490 REPORT 1894.

larger than those through the acid. If we compare the number of mole-

cules of the gas with the number of molecules of sulphuric acid in the same

volume, we tind that the ' molecular conductivity ' of the gas must be many-

million times that of the sulphuric acid (see J. J. Thomson, ' Recent

AResearches on Electricity and Magnetism,' p. 101).  calculation of the

intensity of the current tlirough the gas shows that some hundreds of

amperes must be passing through a square centimetre of the gas, a greater

current than is allowed l)y the Board of Trade rules to pass through the

best conducting electric light leads.

The presence of a very small number of charged ions in a gas will impart

to it a conductivity large enough to bedetected bythe method just described.

As this method of detecting the existence of free ions may perhaps be of
some service to Chemistry, it may be worth while to calculate from the

principles of the Kinetic Theory of Gases the conductivity of a mixture of

free ions and undissociated gas. For the sake of simplicity I will take

the case when the ions form but a small fraction of the undissociated s;as.

D,2="7, we shall get a value of u less than the true one. Substituting

this value for D12, we find

     If the electric intensity is a volt per centimetre, X=10'. In this case
Wj:=70 ; hence for each volt per centimetre we get a velocity of hydrogen
ions equal to 70 cm /sec. With the same electrical intensity the velocity

will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the undissociated gas, so

that when the pressure of this is x^jjjj of the atmospheric pressure the
velocity of hydrogen ions moving through it will be 70,000 cm/sec.

Thus, if q be the current, we have

detect by this method the conductivity of substances whose specific

resistance is 10^" ; hence we could detect the conductivity of the gas even
though .r were as small as 1/7000; that is, we could easily detect the

presence of free ions though they only amount to one part in 7000 of the

total gas. It is important to notice that, inasmuch as the conductivity

varies inversely as the pressure of the undissociated gas, we should be able

to detect the existence of the same percentage of free ions at all pressures.

and the maximum velocity is independent of the pressure. In this case
the direction of the electric intensity gets reversed many times in the
interval between two collisions of the ion ; thus the ions, when they have

acquired a high velocity under the electric intensity, do not, as in the case

when the electric intensity is steady, lose their energy by impact against
other molecules, and so raise the temperature of the surrounding gas ; when
p is very large, the force is reversed before the ions collide, and the velocity
of the ion gets reduced by the action of the electric force. There is in

this case very little heat-production ; the efiect of the free ions is rather to
alter the self-induction of the circuit than its resistance. Thus, if a light

The preceding experiments are, I think, sufficient to show the close

analogies existing between the phenomena of chemical combination and

of the electric discharge, and give hopes that the study of the passao-e of

electricity through gases may be the means of throwing light on the

mechanism of chemical combination. The work of chemists and physicists

may be compared to that of two sets of engineers boring a tunnel from

On the Electrification, of Molecules and Chemical Change.

[Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

More than twenty years ago a striking fact was discovered by Dr.

Wanklyn, that dried sodium could be melted in dried chlorine without the

production of the bright Hame usual under the circumstances. The action of

chlorine oil other metals in absence of moisture was investigated by Dr.

Cowper in 1876. He showed that in many cases the same result was

obtained as that of Dr. Wanklyn in the case of sodium. About this time

Professor Dixon, who was working on the rate of chemical change in a

mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and oxygen, was led to suspect the

great influence of the presence of moisture on the combustion of the

former gas, and he succeeded, by drying a mixture of carbon monoxide and

oxygen as completely as possible, in passing a stream of electric sparks in

the mixture without any explosion taking place. It was this experiment

which first led to the great interest taken by chemists in the influence of

moisture on chemical action. Many chemists have investigated different

chemical actions, and a large number of changes have been shown to be
Adependent on the presence of moisture.
                                         list of them will be found in a

paper on this subject in the ' Chemical Society's Journal ' of July last. It

seemed at one time to a chemist who was studying these actions, that no

chemical action could take place without the presence of moisture. As

action after action was investigated, and as new methods of purification

were introduced, further additions could be made to the list. I have

recently been engaged in studying several decompositions, however, and I

believe that although, in some cases, no breaking up of the molecules takes

place, as in the very interesting case of the action of heat on dried

ammonium chloride, in which no dissociation occurs, yet in some cases

action does take place. Potassium chlorate and silver oxide do decom-

pose, and give not atomic but molecular oxygen. Carbon bisulphide burns

in dried oxygen, although the elements of which it is composed do not.
Oxygen forms ozone under the influence of the electric discharge as rapidly

when dry as when moisture is present. It may be that the substances
have not been sufficiently purified, but I believe it may be due to another
cause. In many of tliese cases in which water- vapour appears to play no
part, we are dealing not with molecules but with atoms. If an atom of

oxygen will not unite with another atom of oxygen, then by the decompo-
sition of dried potassium chlorate we should perhaps get a gas composed
partly of atoms and partly of molecules, and by the decomposition of
silver oxide, if its molecular formula is Ag,0, the gas evolved might be
composed only of atoms. Iii these cases, however, molecules of oxygen

only are obtained. It may be, therefore, that, whatever be the state of

dryness of the substance, atoms will always combine. Similarly with re-
gard to the combustion of carbon bisulphide, though I used all possible care
in its purification, yet it always burnt in dried oxygen. It was noticed,

however, that the decomposition point of carbon bisulphide, when heated
in a neutral gas like nitrogen, was a little below the point of ignition
when heated in oxygen. Therefore, in the latter case, I was dealing not
with carbon bisulphide and oxygen but with carbon bisulphide in a decom-
posing state, carbon and sulphur being set free not in their ordinary state
but in a condition in which they would combine with dried oxygen. This
fact is most easily explained by supposing that when carbon bisulphide is
heated it splits up into atoms of carbon and sulphur, and that these then

combine with oxygen in absence of moisture.

     With regard to the explanation of the effect of moisture on chemical
actions in general, several hypotheses have been suggested. The first, that

of Professor Dixon, is that the water molecules present undergo an actual
decomposition. In the combustion of carbon monoxide, for instance, the

«as takes up oxygen from the water, liberating hydrogen, which then
combines with the free oxygen, re-forming water. I venture to think that

this hypothesis, although I believe it explains all the known facts, is open
to one or two objections. For instance, if we accept Berthelot's law of
maximum work, there seems to be no reason why water should be decom-

posed by red-hot carbon rather than oxygen molecules, since the direct
action on the oxygen liberates a fai- greater amount of energy. Dr.
Tra.ube has suggested that the explanation is dependent on the oxidation
 of water rather than on its reduction ; that hydrogen peroxide is first
 formed by direct union of water-vapour with oxygen, the peroxide again
beino- reduced to water, giving up its extra atom of oxygen to the combus-

tible. This hypothesis seems to be inadequate in many respects, since
many actions in which water plays an important part, e.g., the action of
 sodium on chlorine, or the combination of ammonia and hydrogen chloride,

 free oxygen is not present, and, tlierefore, hydrogen peroxide could not be

 formed.

      Mr. Harcourt fii'st suggested, in 1886, that the explanation of the action
 was to be sought from a physical, rather than from a chemical, point of
 view. Dr. Armstrong proposed in the same year a hypothesis, which he
 calls that of ' reversed electrolysis,' which supposes that no chemical action
 can take place without the presence of a third body, which must be an

 electrolyte. With regard to this theory I hope to be able to say more
 later. I am engaged upon an investigation whose object is to find out
 what substances can replace water in chemical action, and it may be found

 to be the case that all such substances are electrolytes.
       I have been engaged during the last two years in an effort to investi-
ON ELECTRIFICATION OF MOLECULES AND CHEMICAL CHANGE. 495

gate the question whetlier the union of elements and compounds was in

any way connected with electrical discharge. The facts of electrolysis

point strongly in this direction. I gave up at once the idea of directly

investigating the question whether molecules of gases in contact were elec-

trically charged, but in an indirect way I have obtained some evidence on

the question. Taking a tube divided in the middle by a tap, and filling it

with a mixture of dried ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases in equal

proportions, I introduced at the two ends platinum plates which were

oppositely charged from the terminal of a Wimshurst machine. After

half an hour the tap was closed, and the gases in the two parts of the tube

were drawn through a solution of litmus. On admitting moisture white

fumes of ammonium chloride were produced, but there was found to be

residual gas in both halves of the tube. The gas from the part which had

contained the negatively charged plate turned litmus blue, and the gas from

the other part reddened the litmus. The experiment was often repeated,

and the result was the same. The separation was never very great, but the

evidence of some separation seemed conclusive. With other gases there was

also evidence of separation. With air dried by sulphuric acid there was

found to be 1*8 per cent, more oxygen in the part containing the positive

plate than there was in that containing the negative plate. Using a mixture

of hydrogen and oxygen dried by phosphorus pentoxide, analysis showed an

excess of 2-3 per cent, of oxygen in the part of the tube containing the

positively charged plate.

It is possible, therefoi'e, that the molecules of gases which may under

certain circumstances combine together, may have an electrical charge. I

hope to extend these observations to the case of other gases, and to find

out, if possible, whether the charge on the molecules, if it exists, is theirs in-

trinsically, or if it only exists when molecules of a different nature are

in contact with each other.

With the object of finding out if electric discharge bears any analogy

to the process of chemical combination, I undertook some experiments a

year ago to see if electric discharge in air was affected by drying the air

as completely as possible. It was found that sparks from a Ruhmkorff's

coil, when the discharge was very feeble, would leap across a space of

moist air, but that none would pass in the dried air though the sparking

distance was very much less. If, however, a strong discharge was used,

sparks were obtained in the dried air, and, more than this, the feeble

discharge would then easily pass in the dried air. These results entirely

agree with those published by Professor J. J. Thomson.'

I am inclined to think, however, that there may be another interpreta-

tion of the latter part of the phenomenon besides that offered by Professor

Thomson. It may be that the strong discharge splits the molecules into

atoms, and that these can then carry on the feeble discharge. If this is

proved to be true, it will serve as yet another point of analogy between

chemical combination and electric discharge, foi-, as I have tried to show

above, chemical combination does take place between atoms, whatever the

state of dryness of their environment.

With regard to this analogy there may be found some evidence in the

study of the action of actinic light on chemical combination and electric

Wedischarge.  find that when a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen gases

is exposed to light, combination takes place only after a certain interval,

and that the interval is not shortened by exposing the gases separately to

the action of light. If the interval is spent in breaking up molecules into

atoms we should expect that there would be an increase in volume. This
increase in volume has been observed by Pringsheim with tlie mixed gases,
though he ascribes it to another cause. I have undertaken some experi-
ments with unmixed chlorine, and I found that in this case there is
absolutely no increase in volume.

    Now with regard to the analogy of chemical action and electric

discharge we find that light, and light of the same kind as that which

brings about chemical action, has a remarkable influence on the passage
of the electric discharge. This phenomenon was first noticed by the late

Dr. Hertz, who found that when the negative pole of a spark gap was

illuminated by an actinic light a discharge would pass which would not

pass if the spark gap were unilluminated. It may be that the action of

light is to split up molecules into atoms, and that the ready passage of the

discharge is thus explainable. However this may be, I think that the

analogy of the phenomena of electric discharge and chemical combination

may be of importance. I have attempted to point out the analogy which
exists when we work with substances which are in an exceptional state of
dryness. Whether the analogy holds for other influences which affect

chemical combination, and whether the analogies which I have indicated
are only superficial and not real, can only be decided by a long series of
experiments to which I hope to devote myself.

Report on Vlanimeters. Bij Professor 0. Henrici, F.R.S.
       [Ordered bj- the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

Several classifications of planimeters have been used by different writers,

and different names have been used to distinguish them.

Mr. Boys distinguishes three types, which he calls Radius Machines,

Sine or Cosine Machines, and Tangent Machines.

Professor Hele-Shaw has two classes only, according as the recording

apparatus does or does not show slipping.

   A more fundamental classification seems to be got on considering first

of all the geometrical generation of the area by the motion of a line. This

gives us three types : the first follows the generation of an area, as in the

Integral Calculus,  by  rectangular  co-ordinates                                                         the  second  by  polar co-

ordinates ; whilst the third is based on purely geometrical considera-

tions due to Amsler.

   --In the following Report the classification adopted is :

Type I. Orthogonal planimeters.

         IT. Polar co-ordinate planimeters.

       J,

   ,, III. Planimeters of the Amsler type.

Instruments of either type may have a recording oi- integrating appa-

ratus with or without slipping, and this would give rise to subdivisions,

-which, however, it is not necessary to elaborate here.

This Report covers only a comparatively small pai't of the subject of

integrators ; it deals only with planimeters proper. Integrators for such
purposes as the continuous registration of work done, integraphs and

instruments for the integration of differential equations, harmonic ana-

lysers, itc, will not be considered. As it is in these more complicated

instruments that the injurious effect of slipping is chiefly noticeable, a

description of the various integrating apparatus will not be given. For

the same reason the work of Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, Boys, Abdank-Aba-

kanowicz, and Hele-Shaw will remain practically unnoticed.

     With regard to the integrating apparatus in particular, there is the well-
known paper on ' Mechanical Integrators,' by Professor Hele-8haw, in the

' Proceedings ' of the Institute of Civil Engineers for 1885, in which, besides,

many descriptions with figures are given of instruments here treated of.

     In this Report there is first given the geometrical theory of generating

areas, together with simple descriptions of planimeters based on it. Then
follows a historical sketch up to the invention of Amsler's planimeter.

Next, this instrument is considered, its errors are discussed, together
with those more modern planimeters which have been constructed with a
view to avoid these errors. Lastly, some planimeters are described which

have recently been introduced.

The object of a planimeter is to measure an area ; it has, therefore, to

solve a geometrical problem by mechanical means.

To give at once an idea how this is possible, consider a very simple case.

ABIf a line                                             (fig. 1) of finite length I moves parallel to itself to CD,

mounted on it. On placing this apparatus

on the paper above the line AB, the wheel

resting on the paper, and moving this rod

along to CD, it will describe the same

area. At the same time the wheel will '

turn and the arc of its circumference, which

comes in contact with the paper, will have

the length iv. If the circumference is

graduated and a fixed index is provided, say, at the highest point, the

length of this arc can at once be read off.

    This arc, as read off at the index, may be called conveniently the ' roll

of the wheel (Macfarlane Gray).

This instrument may be considered as a simple planimetei-, which, how-

ever, measures only the areas of rectangles with fixed altitude, and is, there-

fore, practically of no use. Nevertheless it will serve to elucidate a great

many properties common to nearly all planimeters.

    First we have a geometrical generation of an area by aid of a moving

line, and secondly the ' recording apparatus ' represented by the wheel, with
its graduation and index. It is advisable always to keep these two ideas
quite separate. The one is geometrical, the other kinematic. The former

of these will first of all engage our attention.

Our instrument teaches us, if the 'rod' QT is moved one way, the

' roll ' of the wheel will increase, whilst it will decrease when moved in the

opposite sense. Hence we must consider the 'sense ' in which the motion

takes place                                             we shall call the one motion positive, the other negative.  At

A Wethen on moving the rod from to C the roll will be negative.  there-

fore say that the area generated is likewise negative.

    This shows that we must also give the rod QT a definite sense, and we

Qshall take this as positive from to T, so that Q is the beginning, _T the
Aend of the rod.
                  reversion of this sense is equivalent to a reversion of

the graduation of the wheel. To fix the idea, I shall suppose that on looking
along the rod in its jwsitive sense--i.e., from _Q to T the numbers on the

graduation of the wheel i7icrease in the clockwise sense.

     Under this supposition the line QT, when placed anyhow on the paper,

·will generate a positive or negative area according as it is moved to the

left or to the right respectively. This can be put differently.

     The roll of the wheel will thus again record the area. This will be

positive for counter-clockwise turning, negative if the turning is clockwise.

    If the wheel should be mounted on the continuation of QT beyond Q,

then c will be negative ; so will be the ' roll,' and the result will be posi-
tive again. It will thus be seen that our rule holds also for this case.

       First Mode of Generating an Area.

Consfder now fig. 3. Let the lineQT start at AA' and move to BB',

OXthe point Q remaining always on  and QT perpendicular to the latter,

whilst T moves along the curve A'B'. The line QT will now generate

the area ABB'A', but in doing so it will continuously change its length.

     With regard to the sense of the area the rule of sign holds. Hence

if, in QTfig. 4, moves from AA' to BB', whilst T remains on the lower

branch of the curve, it will sweep over the area AA'C'B'B, and this will

be negative. But if now the point T moves back to A' on the upper

branch, then the area BB'TA'A will be swept over in the positive sense.

The whole area generated will be the difference of these two areas i.e., it

will be the area of the given closed curve.
ON PLANIMETERS.                                             499

    The point T describes during this process the whole boundary of the

area, going always in the same sense along it. If this sense be changed,

the motion of QT will also be reversed, and consequently the area will

become negative.
     This shows that the sense of an area is determined by the sense given to

its boundary ; and, further, that the area is jjositive if it lies to the left of a
person tvho goes round the boundary in its positive sense. If it lies to the

right it will be negative.

     In the application of the Integral Calculus to the evaluation of areas

Fig. 3.

the rule of sign generally adopted is in case of rectangular co-ordinates
the reverse to the one here adopted; in using polar co-ordinates, however,

it agrees with it. As it would be very inconvenient to use here two rules,
a choice had to be made ; and I consider on the whole the rule adopted as

the one most generally useful.

     If the closed curve cuts itself, as in fig. 5, take anywhere in the

plane a line OX, not shown in the figure, then a point T on the curve,
and draw the perpendicular TQ to OX. On moving T along the whole

QTcurve til it returns to its starting-point the line  will sweep over a

perfectly definite area, and this is taken as the area enclosed by the <^iven

curve. To see what it means we may apply again the rule of si^n and

see how often and in what sense the line QT passes over any given point.

It will be found that every point without the curve is passed over either

Tiot at all, or else as often in one as in the opposite sense. Each separate
part in which the plane is divided by the curve will be swept over a
certain number of times, which is easily determined by applying the rule.
In the figure these numbers are inserted.

                                                                   Fig. 5.

     This generalisation of the meaning of an area has long been adopted
in geometry, principally through the writings of Mobius. According to

Cremona, it was first given by De Morgan.'

                                                                   Fig. 6.

To build a planimeter on these geometrical lines we have to add a

suitable recording apparatus. The simple wheel rolling on the paper is not

QTany longer sufi&cient, as the length of the generating line or ' rod '  varies.

But if the wheel is made to turn faster in proportion to the length QT, we

should have what is wanted. This was obtained in the first planimeter by

Hiaking the wheel run on a cone.

The diagrammatic drawing (hg. 6) will simplify the description.

A frame FF is made movable in the direction of the line OX, either

by letting it run on rails or by giving the wheels milled rims. On it

rests a rod T'T perpendicular to OX, which can slide to and fro in its

own direction. It ends at T in a tracer which can be made to follow

any curve. The frame also carries a cone VCC, whose axis is inclined to

CCthe paper, so that the upper edge is horizontal. Its rim  rests on the

paper, so that it turns when the frame moves, and this turning will be pro-

portional to the forward motion. Mounted on the rod, or, as in the figure,
Won an axis parallel to the rod, is a wheel

line the wheel will not turn. But if T is pulled out a distance QT=2/,

^QT^y. On moving the frame forward the roll of the wheel will be

proportional to y and to the forward motion. Hence if the tracer T is

Aguided along a curve from to B, then the roll will be proportional to the

area between the curve and the axis OX.

Taking rectangular co-ordinates OQ=.x' and QT=y, we have in the

symbols of the Integral Calculus the above area= ydx, and the roll of

the wheel will be proportional to this.
     This planimeter follows in its construction the determination of an

area in the Integral Calculus using rectangular co-ordinates. Planimeters

of this type have therefore been called orthogonal planimeters (Dr. A.

Amsler).

     If the tracer is moved round a closed curve the instrument gives the
enclosed area, but it is worthy of notice that the reading has also a mean-

ing if the curve is not closed.

Second Mode of Generating an Area.

If a line QT of constant length turns in the plane of the paper about

its fixed point Q, it will sweep over a sector of a circle. If this generating

Qline has, as before, a positive sense from     t? "
                                                                     '
to T, it will be seen at once that the area                         '

swept over will be positive or negative ac-

cording as it turns in one or in the opposite

sense. It will also be seen that our rule of

sign will again serve to determine the sense,

and that this will still hold if the length of

QT is variable.

     From this it follows :

    If a line QT of variable length turns

about its fixed end Q, then the area generated

by it whilst T describes a closed curve tvill

he equal to the area bounded by this curve.
     For our rule shows at once that every

point within the curve, if this does not cut itself, will be passed over once
(fig. 7), every point without the curve either not at all or as often in one
            --

502 REPORT 1894.

sense as in the other. The point Q may be either within or without the

area.

     If the curve cuts itself, the area swept over Avill be the same as in the
former case (fig. 5), and all the remarks made there will be applicable.

     This is the mode in which areas are generated when using polar co-

ordinates. Planimeters based on this principle might therefore be called

polar planimeters. But as this name has been appropriated for an
altogether different type, I call these simply planimeters of Type II., or

Polar-co-ordinate Planimeters.

                     Third Mode of Generating an Area.

     Whilst in the last two cases an area was generated by a line of
variable length which had either a motion of translation or a motion of

                                                                    Fig. 8.

 turning alone, we shall now suppose that a line has both motions but a

 constant length.

     Let QT again denote the generating line now of constant length l.

 Let it be moved from the position QqTo (fig. 8) to a near position, QT.
 This motion can be decomposed into a small translation to QTj and a

 Qturning about which bi-ings it to its final position, QT. For both these

 motions our rule of sign holds ; it will therefore also hold for the

 actual motion of the line where both motions go on simultaneously. On

 applying the rule the following theorem will be seen to be true in which a
 motion of a line is called cyclical if it ultimately returns to its initial
 position (compare fig. 9).

     Theorem 1. If a line QT of constant length performs in a -plane a

 cyclical motion, then the area generated is equal to the area enclosed by the

 path of the end point T diminished by that enclosed by the path of Q, both

 areas being talcen in their proper sense as determined by the sense in which

--each boundary is described.
     Corollary. If the 2}oint Q is moved to and fro along a curve so that its

 path does not enclose an area, then the area generated ivill be equal to the

 area enclosed in the piath of T.

      The measurement of this area is much facilitated by the following

 considerations. Let ^j denote the perpendicular distance between the

position QoTo andQT,, and « be the angle through which the rod is turned.

=The area generated by the iirst step, the translation, is then Ip, the area

of the sector is i I'^d. The whole area swept over by the rod is the sum of

the areas due to the successive elementary
steps. It consists, therefore, also of two

parts, the first being due to the elementary

translations and equals l'S:p, where 2^ is the

sum of all the lateral displacements of the
rod. The second part consists of the sum of

all the sectors of circles described by the

turning of the rod, and equals ^ Z'^SW, where

Sfi denotes the sum of all the elementary

turnings, and this is the same as the total

turning of the rod. But the rod returns

to its original position. The angle Sa is
=therefore either
                   or it is a multiple of

Iw, which will happen if the rod has turned

round once or several times. This gives

      Theorem 2. If a rod offinite length per-
forms a cyclical motion ivithout itself making

a complete rotation, then the area siuept over

equals that generated hy the successive mo-

tions of translation only ; hut if it completes

n rotations, then to this quantity has to be

added nTrP, i.e., n times the area of a circle ofradi^is 1.

    To construct a planimeter on these principles, let the rod QT be con-

nected by an articulated joint at Q to another rod OQ, which shall pi
Ofuture be called the 'arm' (fig. 10). Let this arm have at
                                                             a needle

point which can be pressed into the drawing-board. This being done, the

point Q will be restrained to move on a circle, whilst T can be guided by
hand along any curve. The point O is called the pole of the instrument

and the latter is therefore generally called a Polar Planimeter.
--504 REPORT 189 J.

Let, now, T be moved round a closed curve whilst the pole is outside

its area (fig. 10). The point Q moves to and fro along the circle and

returns to its original position when T does so. The motion of the rod

Anwill therefore be cyclical.  exception can only occur if during the

motion rod and arm should become stretched out to their fullest extent,

and on moving on, Q should be allowed to move the wrong way. This

can always be easily avoided.

The corollary to Theorem 1 is therefore applicable. It says that

the area is equal to the area generated by the rod QT. But this area,

according to Theorem 2, equals the area generated by the motions of

translation alone, and this can be recorded by a simple wheel. Let there

be mounted anywhere on the rod a wheel W, at a distance c from Q.

      If a small motion of tiie rod be decomposed as before (fig. 8), the

WWwheel will move along the line "SVqW during the translation and along the

arc during the turning. The first may again be decomposed in the

motion from W^W", whereby the rod describes the area pi whilst the

W W,wheel rolls, the amount of its 'roll' measuring 7*, and the motion

                          History of Planimeters up to 1856.

     From an article published by Bauernfeind, of Munich, in Dingler's

' Polytechnisches Journal,' vol. 137, p. 82, it appears that the Bavarian

engineer J. JM. Hermann invented a planimeter in 1814. This was im-
proved by Lammle in 1816, and carried out in the following year. No-

thing, however, was published about it, and the instrument was forgotten,
without having any influence on the further history of the planimeter and
its development.

     In 1824, the Italian Tito Gonnella, professor at Florence, invented a

--planimeter very much on the same lines as Hermann viz., an instrument of

Type I.
     In the following year he published ' Teoria e descrizione d' una macchina

colla quale si quadrano le superficie piane. Dall' Autologia . . . dell' anno

182.5. Tomo 18. Al gabinetto scientitico e letterario di G. P. A'ieusseaux,

Firenze, direttore ed editore. Tipografia di Luigi Peggati, 182-3, Firenze.'

     This paper is short and without figures. Later on he gave a fuller
description in his ' Opuscoli Matematici' (Firenze. 1841). Both pub-
lications appear to have remained practically unknown till Professor

REPORT 1894-'

                                                                «

Anton Favaro, of Padua, called attention to them in his ' Beitrage zur
Geschichte der Planimeter ' (' Allgemeine Bauzeitung,' Wien, 1873). In

this paper it is pointed out that Gonnella, even thougli anticipated in the
invention by Hermann, was the first to publish anything about a Plani-

meter.

     His first instrument was of Type I., with the recording wheel rolling
on a cone as described. Soon after he replaced the cone by a disc.

     Gonnella had one instrument made, but it seems he was unable from the
want of skilled labour in Florence to obtain a well-executed piece of me-

chanism. When the Archduke of Tuscany wished to add a well-made plani-

meter to his collection, Gonnella looked for its execution to Switzerland,

Avhere tlie flourishing watch industry had developed accurate workmanship.

He accordingly sent, in 1825 and 1826, through a Florence merchant,

numbers of drawings to different firms in Switzerland, without, however,

succeeding in getting Mdiat he wanted.

     In 1826 the Swiss engineer Oppikofer invented a planimeter, and this

was made in the following year. How much he had heard of Gonnella's

invention or of Hermann's cannot now be decided. It is, of course, quite
possible that he should have made an independent discovery. Bauern-

feind estimates that at that time about a billion areas had annually

to be evaluated in Europe. He also gives in the paper quoted a pretty

long list of various contrivances for facilitating this work, and which,
by the way, were called planimeters (they were not integrators). The
problem was, therefore, one that pressed for a solution, and it would be
quite in conformity with other instances in tlie history of science that

several men should perfectly independently make the same invention.

Nevertheless, there is a possibility if not probability that Oppikofer should

have heard of Gonnella's invention. Anyhow, it is his instrument which
became the starting-point of the further development of planimeters.

     Oppikofer, it seems, put himself in communication with the mechani-
cian Ernst in Paris (before 1836) to introduce the instrument in France.

Thus it comes that planimeters of Type I. are known in France by the
name of Ernst, who improved them and made them practical instru-

ments. He retained the wheel rolling on a cone, although Gonnella had

already in 1825 replaced the cone by a horizontal disc. Ernst received,
in 1837, a portion of the Montyon Prize as a reward.

     It will be remembered that the cone allows only of positive ordinates
of the curve. The engineer Wetli, of Ziirich, tiied (1849) to remedy this by
using two cones with their vertices opposite, so that the upper edges of
both formed one straight line. In order to make the path for the wheel
continuous he meant to cover both with one disc to be turned by the cones.
But then he found, of course, that he could do without the cones if only he
drove the disc so that its rotation was propoi'tional to the side motion of

the line QT. Having the idea of the disc given, we see at once that

this disc is only a special case of a cone which has degenerated into a

plane, but it is always of interest to learn the roundabout way in which

improvements are made.'

     This improvement was, as has already been mentioned, anticipated by
Gonnella, but was now introduced practically. Disc-planimeters were
made by Starke in Vienna under the name of Wetli-Starke Planimeters.
They were improved by the astronomer Hansen, of Seeberg, near Gotha,

    ' These data concermng Wetli's invention of the disc I owe to Covadi, to whom

the late Professor Harlacher in Pras; had communicated them.

and became, as executed by Ausfeld in that town, instruments of very
Agreat accuracy, known as the Wetli-Hansen Planimeters.
                                                         description

with figure is given by Bauernfeind in the ' Proceedings ' of the ' Poly-
technischer Verein fur das Konigreich Bayern,' 1853, pp. 130-147, and

213-244. The ligure is copied in Prof. Dyck's 'Catalogue of the Mathe-

matical Exhibition,' Nachtrag, p. 32, Munich, 1893.

The disc is turned by aid of a silver wire which is attached to the rod

QT and slung round a pulley on the axis of the disc, so that here rod and

carriage have interchanged their role.

    Among Hansen's improvements one may be mentioned, as I have
recently heard of it as a new American improvement. The tracer T is

replaced by a piece of glass with a small circular mark on it which is
Aguided along the curve.
                          lens above the glass serves to make the guiding

more accurate. This form of a tracer is, however, straining to the eye, and

seems only of use where areas have to be determined with great accuracy.

In England, John Sang made a planimeter which is described in the

'Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal,' 1851, p. 505, and also in the

* Transactions ' of the Ptoyal Scottish Society of Arts, vol. iv. Bauernfeind

says that it differs from that by Ernst 'fast gar nicht.'
     It was exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851, and obtained

honourable mention, whilst Gonnella received a Council medal and Wetli
a prize medal. Ausfeld also exhibited a planimeter, which is described
as invented by Dr. Flaussen (probably an error for Hansen), of the
Observatory of Seeberg. Of this instrument, which received honourable
mention, I have not found any further description than that it had a

wheel rolling on a disc. It was most likely the modification of Wetli's,

referred to above.
     These exhibits are of importance in the history of planimeters, because

they drew Maxwell's attention to the subject, on which he communicated
early in 1855 a paper to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts ('Trans-
actions,' vol. iv., and 'Collected Papers,' vol. i. p. 230). In this he
points out the deleterious effect of the slipping of the recording wheel
on the cone or disc, and then proceeds to the description of a new recording
apparatus, in which the wheel rolling on a cone or disc is replaced by a

sphere, which rolls without slipping on an equal sphere. It is a most beautiful

conti'ivance, but it has never been carried out. It may, however, be con-
sidered as the starting-point of all integrators which work without slipping.

     Maxwell describes two planimeters having this new contrivance, the

one belonging to Type I., the other to Type II.
     About this time Josef Stadler, of Eisenerz, in Styria, constructed a

planimeter of peculiar character. It works without slipping, and is in many

respects of interest on account of the peculiar integrating apparatus used.

    The tracer T is fastened to a bar whose motion is constrained to remain

parallel to the axis of x. Rigidly connected with this is a thin cylinder,

which can turn about an axis parallel to the bar, hence to the axis of x.

This cylinder rests on a surface of revolution movable about its axis a,

which is parallel to the axis of y. If the tracer be moved in the direction

of the y, the cylinder will roll along a meridian curve of the surface of
Are\ olution, but the latter will remain at rest.
                                                   motion of the tracer in

the direction of the x will pull the cylinder across the surface of revolution,

and therefore make it revolve to an extent which is proportional to the

distance of the point of contact from its axis a. If ;; denotes this distance,

and y the distance of the tracer from the axis of x, i.e., the generating line

QT, then the turning of the surface of revolution will measure the area,

provided that zy remains constant. In order tliat this condition may be

satisfied, the meridian curve of the surface of revolution must be a solution

Anof a differential equation of the first order and the second degree.

integral of this equation cannot be found in a finite form, but an equi-
lateral hyperbola revolving about an asymptote satisfies the condition very
nearly. In the instrument made this hyperbola was corrected by actual
trial. It will be seen that there is no slipping. The difficult construction
of the surface of revolution makes it doubtful whether a very great accu-

racy is obtainable. But as Dr. A. Amsler, who called my attention at the

Munich Exhibition to this model, poihted out to me, the principle might be

useful in the construction of integrators designed for special purposes.

     Stadler had a first, and as it seems an only instrument made in 1855,
which is now in the possession of the Technische Hochschule in Gratz. It
was exhibited in Munich. Stadler published an account of it in the journal
' Erfahrungen im berg- und liiittenmannischen Bau- und Aufbereitungs-
wesen,' edited by Rittinger, 1857. It seems to have remained practically
unknown till the Munich Exhibition. In Dyck's ' Catalogue ' is a full
account of it by Professor Lichtenfels, of Gratz.

     It appears that Stadler, in the out-of-the-way place where he lived, had
iseard of planimeters, but was not acquainted with their construction.

                                  Planimeters of Type II.

      Of Polar-co-ordinate planimeters Amsler mentions three (Appendix to
his paper of 1856) proposed by Gierer, of Fiirth,' by Bouniakovsky, of
St. Petersburg, and by Decker, of Augsburg (the last two described in
Dingler's ' Pol. Journ.,' vol. cxl.). Each has a recording wheel rolling on
the paper whose axis passes through a fixed point Q, whilst its distance

from Q is always proportional to the square of the distance of the tracer
T from Q. In Gierer's instrument the wheel is kept in the required

position by aid of a guiding curve, in the other two by aid of link-work.
     One of Maxwell's planimeters belongs to this type, and so does one by

C V. Boys.- Both were invented with the object of avoiding all slijjpiiig

in the recording apparatus, which is too complicated for an instrument
designed simply for the determination of areas.

     Lastly, there is an instrument described by W. E. Bousfield in the
discussion of Hele-Shaw's paper ' On Mechanical Integrators.' ^ In it

guide curves are used.

     None of these planimeters has, so far as I know, ever been made.
Of Boys' a model is to be found in the Science collection at South Ken-

sington.

                    Amsler's Planimeter and its Development.

     Whilst planimeters of Type I. were gradually reaching a state of
great perfection, Amsler invented his polar planimeter, which, in conse-
<quence of its simplicity, handiness in use, and low price, soon drove all the

older forms, which, when well made, were necessarily expensive, out of the

field.

     Jacob Amsler, as I have been told by the late Prof. Hesse, was at the

time a student at Konigsberg, where Prof. Franz Neumann encouraged
his students to work at the lathe and otherwise use their hands. He thus
was enabled to make his first instrument with his own hands in about 1854.

His first publication about it is ' Ueber die mechanische Bestimmung des
Flacheninhalts, der statischen Momente und der Tragheitsmomente ebener

Figuren, insbesondere iiber einen neuen Planimeter,' ' Vierteljahrsschrift

der naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Ziirich,' 1856 ; also in Moigno's

journal, 'Cosmos,' February 29, 1856. This planimeter is so well known
that no description is necessary beyond what has been said already about
planimeters of Type III. Many thousands of them have been manufactured
by Amsler at his works in Schaff'hausen, and though in England many
are sold with the name of an English firm engraved on them, practically all

have come from Schaffhausen.

     The instrument has practically remained unaltered since its invention.

    It is made either with a rod QT of invariable length, giving the area,

say, in square inches, or with a rod of which the length may be changed so

that the same instrument can be set to give the area in different units.
     To the latter Amsler has added on the top of the rod a pointer, and

another on the ' sleeve ' in which the rod slides. These are at a distance

equal to that between the tracer T and the joint at Q. It is thus possible

to set the instrument so that the length I of the rod equals the greatest

extension, parallel to a given line, of the area. The reading of the instru-
ment is then proportional to the mean height of the area perpendicular
to that line. This is especially useful for finding the mean pressure directly

from an indicator diagram.
      Mr. Druitt Halpin has added a simple locking gear to the recording

wheel, so that the instrument can be taken up without moving the wheel.

This has the advantage that the instrument can be placed in a good light

for reading, but it is also particularly useful in cases where the mean
pressure, as determined from a great number of indicator diagrams, is
required. The instrument may be set to zero, then locked, placed on the

paper, and one diagram after the other run over, the wheel being always
locked whilst the diagrams are being changed. The final reading divided

by the number of diagrams used gives the mean at once.

      For the mere facility of reading another recent improvement is of far
greater importance. It consists in replacing the reflecting surface of white
metal on which the graduation used to be engraved by the matt white of
celluloid with black lines on it.

   --Of the many theories of Amsler's planimeter which have been given

and their name is legion most make use of the Integral Calculus.
      J. Amsler starts with geometrical considerations similar to those which

I have given at the beginning. With these I became originally acquainted

through Culmann's 'Graphische Statik.' They give, in my opinion, th&

 quickest access to the real nature of all planimeters.

      The other theories serve as examples, and some as very good illustra-

 tions, of the use of curvilinear co-ordinates.

     Here it may be remarked that the integration as performed by the
 planimeter gives really a line-integral, and many of the proofs which start

 with the evaluation of an element of the area are examples of transforming
 an integral over an area into a line-integral over the boundary ; hence they
 are simple examples of Stokes' Theorem.

--510 REPORT 1894.

     Dr. A. Amsler in his valuable paper, ' Ueber den Flacheninhalt und
das Volumen durch Bewegung erzeugten Curveii und Flachen, und iiber

mechanische Integrationen ' (Inaugural Dissertation, SchafFhausen, 1880),
starts with proving that the area passed round by the tracer equals

                                    'Y

where ds is an element of the boundary and o the angle it makes with the

rod, the integration being taken over the whole boundary. It is therefore

a true line-integral.

Where tlie only object is to explain Anisler's planimeter, Macfai'lane

Cray's theory is perhaps the simplest. It is given in Carr's ' Synoj^sis of

Mathematics.'

In 185.5, hence at very nearly the same time as Amsler, Prof. Miller

Hitter von Hauenfels invented a planimeter based on the same principles
as Amsler's. It is described in the ' Handbuch der niederen Geodasie

(2nd to 7th ed.), by Prof. Pr. Hartner, and also in Dyck's ' Catalogue,'

p. 190. Gustav Starke, of Vienna, simplified the arrangement of the

recording wheel, and manufactured ' in the course of years hundreds of

them.' It is known as the Miller-Starke Planimeter.

    As Amsler's polar planimeter is universally used, the following discus-
sion of its errors may be of interest.

First error : The diameter of the wheel and the length of the ' rod '

are not in the proper relation i.e., if u is the unit division of the recording

wheel, I the length of the rod, the product lu does not give the accurate

unit of area intended. This error is generally very small. Otherwise all

readings have to be multiplied by a factor of reduction.

Second error : The axis of the wheel is not parallel to the rod, but

makes an angle i with it.

  WIf is the ' roll ' of the wheel and S the slipping (due to translation

of the rod only), the area then is

                       A^ W +^ cos £ .
                                    S-f- ^ sin e .  nirl-

Or, as £ is practically very small,

                         A = ZW+?S£ + 7f7rZ2

This introduces an error, ZSf, which may be appreciable.

If a rod QT' be fixed to the rod QT, making an angle i with the normal

to the latter and of equal length to it, then, whilst T describes the boundary

of the area A, the point T' will describe another closed curve. The area

bounded by this curve is SZ. This area will often be small, but it is easy

to draw curves for which it is considerable, by guiding T' round an area

of considerable size. If T circumscribes an area A, and T' an area A',
A A Athen the error S in will be
                       sin t, and that in A' will be sin f.

This error has been investigated by Herr Wilski in ' Zeitschrift fiir

Vermessungswesen,' 1892, p. f>10.

In the same journal for 1891, Herr Lang has shown how to eliminate

it. About this more will be said presently in connection with the Lang-

Coradi Planimeter.

    Third error : The axis of the joint at Q between the arm OQ and the
rod QT is not perpendicular to the paper i.e., not parallel to the axis about

which the instrument turns at O. See Wilski's paper.
ON PLANIMETERS.  511

    Fourth error : Due to slipping of the wheel. This is the error on which

Maxwell dwelt strongly.
     This error increases with the amount of slipping, with the friction

resisting the slipping, and lastly with the resistance to the turning of the

wheel.

     In order to reduce this error, the above three causes have to be dimin-

ished. This has led to a number of new constructions, which have to be
discussed presently. It may here be stated that the third has led to the
introduction of a ' disc,' as used in the planimeters of Type I., on which
the wheel rolls. The rough paper is, therefore, replaced by a smooth pre-

pared surface.

     To reduce the resistance to the turning of the wheel, mechanical skill

alone can help.

     But to reduce the first cause we have to investigate the amount of slip-

ping at different positions of the rod of the instrument relative to the arm.

If it be placed in such a position that the plane of the wheel passes through

the pole O, and if now the instrument be moved as a rigid body, then the
tracer will describe a circle. At the same time, the wheel will not roll, but

only slip. This circle, formerly referred to as the base-circle, will be the

locus of greatest slipping.

     If the tracer be moved along this circle there should be no turning, and
there will be none. Hence, on this circle itself, the error due to slipping
will be zero. If, however, the tracer be moved on a concentric circle a

little inside the base-circle, then rolling will take place in one sense, but
on a circle a little outside in the opposite sense. In either case there will

be much slipping, causing an error. This error will be pi'oportional to
the length of the path of the wheel, i.e., to the roll ; hence, on moving

the tracer parallel to the hasec-ircle, but at an increased distance from it,
the error will increase on account of the increased roll, and decrease on
account of the decreased slipping. It will soon reach a maximum, and
then diminish. The same is true outside the base-circle, only the error

will be of the opposite sense.'

      It becomes thus apparent that the error due to slipping is dependent
on the position of the pole relative to the area, and also that with changing
the position of the pole the eiTors change in an apparently haphazard
manner.

      It is of interest to compare these results with practical tests.
Wilski points out that there are certain positions of the pole for which
tlie record of the wheel becomes a maximum, others for which it is a
minimum. This is explained by supposing that in these cases a part of
the boundary of the area is parallel and near the base-circle either on the

     ' I have just (Octoher 30) received from Coradi a paper by Lang (reprint from
the Allgemehie Yermcsmnqs-Naeliricliten, 1894) in which he discusse.'* the errors
of an Amsler Planimeter, and remarks that the tracer T can be moved from any
position so that the wheel will only slip without rolling. This is obvious when
pointed out. These paths are spirals, one through every point, which approach the
base circle asymptotically either from within or from without, so that there are

two sets of these curves, all of one set being congruent. My reasoning in the text

must therefore be extended to these spirals also.
     To reduce the error due to slipping no part of the boundary of the area to be

measured should therpfore be parallel to one of these curves or to the base-circle.
Lang recommends to draw one of each of these spirals by trial and to cut it out
in stiff paper By aid of these templets it is then easy to place the planimeter
so on the paper that the boundary cuts the base circle and these spirals nearly at

right angles.
512 REPORT-- 1894.

one or the other side of it. Wilski seems to attribute it to an obliquity
in the joint at Q. Coradi's experiences during more than ten years also

reveal these maxima and minima. But he finds them equally in all plani-
meters where a wheel is used, and draws the conclusion that the error
causing them must lie in the wheel and in the resistance to its turning.
The slipping he does not mention, but there seems no doubt that in it lies

the true dynamical cause.

     Fifth error : The axis of the wheel does not Ue in the rod QT, but at
a small distance sideways from it. This introduces a small amount of

extra sUpping.

     The errors discussed so far depend on the construction, the next on the

skill of the manipulator.

    Sixth error : Due to wrong guiding of the tracer.
    As the tracer has to be guided by hand round the curve, there will
always be slight deviations. Of the error hereby introduced not much can

be said in general. It depends on the skill and care of the manipulator.

The latter should always look as much as possible in the direction in
which the tracer moves along its path, so that any deviation may at once

be detected. These deviations will, in general, be partly positive, partly
negative, so that the errors introduced will greatly cancel each other.

     To separate these errors from those due to the instrument it is neces-
sary to guide the tracer mechanically round a known area. For this pur-
pose Coradi uses, and sells with his planimeters, a ' Control-lineal,' con-

sisting of a strip of metal with a line mai'ked along the middle of its

length. On this line a series of little conical holes are made to receive

the tracer. It can turn round a needle-point at one end, which is pressed

into the drawing-board. But to make good tests with it requires some

skill.

     Elaborate tests of A'arious planimeters have been made in this manner
by Prof. Lorber, of Leoben (' Zeitschrift fiir Vermessungswesen,' 1883 and

1888).

     Rules for the accurate use of planimeters and for testing them are
also given by Coradi in a pamphlet ' Praktische Anleitung zum Gebrauch,

etc., des einfachen Polar-Planimeters,' 2te Aufl., Ziirich, 1888.

                        HoHMANN- Coradi and Lang-Coradi,

     Amsler's polar planimeter remained practically unaltered till the

Bavarian engineer F. Hohmann constructed his ' precision planimeter ' in
1876. In 1880 he communicated his ideas to Coradi in Zurich, who has

since constructed it in a variety of different forms.

     The Hohmann-Coradi precision planimeter is of Type III. But the
recording wheel rolls on a disc with finely prepared surface. This disc

Qitself is turned by the motion of the point of the generating line or ' rod '

QT. The wheel rests with light pressure on the disc. The friction to be
overcome by the slipping of the wheel is thus greatly diminished.

     Of the different forms used by Coradi, I mention only the ' rolling

planimeter.' The point Q is guided along a straight line by the aid of a

carriage which rests on two wheels with milled edges. The motion of the
instrument in this direction is thus unlimited. Such wheels without rails
had been used already by Sang and by J. Stadler (Dyck's ' Catalogue ') for
a planimeter of Type III.
         ON PLANIMETEKS.                                        513

     Amsler, too, has since 1882 made planinieters with the wheel rolling
ou a disc.

     Soon after the construction of these instruments, Amsler published his
paper ' Neuere Planimeter-Constructionen ' (' Zeitschrift fiir Instrumenten-

kunde,' 1884), which is full of interest. He describes a planimeter in which

a wheel rolls on a sphere, and which is designed to measure areas on a

sphere or globe instead of a plane. He shows that all known planimeters

in which a recording wheel is employed may be considered as special cases
of his new instrument. Of course, if the radius of the globe is taken in-
finitely large, we get a plane.

    By introducing a cylinder instead of the wheel he gets an instrument

where there is no slipping, and he says that this planimeter is the only
one which deserves the name of ' precision planimeter.' This instrument
has never been made. In fact, Amsler considers it too complicated, and

                                                                   Fig. la.

states that, although he had sold (up to 1 884) over 1 2,000 polar planimeters,
only a few hundred of his more complicated Moment-planimeter had
been made.

Influenced, no doubt, by this paper and the criticism it contained,

Coradi made soon after what he calls a ' Precisions-Kugel-Planimeter.' At

the cost of retaining a very slight amount of slipping he simplifies Amsler's

mechanism considerably, and produces a simple and liandy instrument,

of which in four years, up to 1892, over 450 have been sold. It is made

polar planimeter ; if T is moved round the boundary of an area wliich
may be denoted by (T), then the rod QT will sweep over an area equal to

(T) which has to be registered. This is done by the ' roll ' of a cylinder

EF, whose axis is parallel to the ' rod.' This cylinder does not roll on the

paper, but on a spherical surface S. The latter can revolve about a hori-

AD Bzontal diameter
                which is parallel to the arm OQ, and which has at

a small toothed wheel gearing in the rim B'BB" of the fixed disc. Let

EFthe cylinder  touch this sjjhere at C in the horizontal great circle,

Aand let be the centre of the sphere. If now the rod and with it the
QXaxis of the cylinder make an angle a with the tangent
                                                         to the circular

path of Q, then the distance of the point C from the axis of the sphere

CD=rwill be  sin a, where r is the radius of the surface S. Let now

the rod QT get a small translation to Q'T', sweeping over a small area

QTT'Q' =:lp. Of course, QQ' must be so small that it may be con-

sidered an arc of the circle in which Q moves. If QQ'=a;, then is p
^jcsina, the areaQTT'Q'=/.r sin o. Atthe sametimeOQ will turn about O

through an angle proportional to x, and this will produce a rotation of the

sphere and a motion of C proportional to CD.v, i.e., proportional to x sin a

or to p. This will be communicated to the cylinder. Hence the roll of the

cylinder during a small motion of T will be proportional to the area swept

over by the rod during the translation of the rod. According to tlie

general theory of planimeters of Type III., the ' roll ' of the cylinder measures

the area enclosed by the path of T, provided that the rod does not com-

plete a whole rotation. If the point O should lie within the area, a certain

constant has to be added to the ' roll ' of the cylinder, as in Amsler's simple

planimeter.

    QTThis very simple theory is, however, not quite correct. For if

turns about Q the cylinder will not always touch the sphere. To insure a

continuous contact the cylinder is mounted in a small rectangular frame,

which itself can rock to and fro about an axis parallel to that of the rod.

   AAmsler, in the planimeter mentioned, places Q at the centre of the

sphere and suspends the frame with the cylinder from above the sphere.
In this case a turning of the arm will make the cylinder slip along the
horizontal great circle. To avoid this slipping he makes the cylinder

movable along its axis, and gets thus an instrument without slipping.

QXCoradi places the point Q so that when the rod is in the direction of

the cylinder touches the sphere when its axis is vertically above Q. If now

the rod be turned about Q, the cylinder with its frame will be pushed side-

ways, whilst the point C will move below the horizontal great circle. This
up-and-down motion of C will produce a roll of the cylinder, the total
amount of which, however, will reduce to zero when the point C comes
back to its original position, and this it will do when the tracer has de-

scribed a closed curve.

    But this lowering of C also increases the radius CD. At the same

time the cylinder will not receive the full motion of the point C. In
fact, this motion will be decomposed into rolling and slipping. The

rolling will be just the same as if C was still on the horizontal great circle,
and will therefore give the area correctly. The slipping will always be
very small. There will also be slipping when the rod turns about Q, but

this again will be very small. Although the exact determination of these

quantities is not difficult, I prefer to refer the reader to A. Amsler's essay,
' Ueber mechanische Integrationen,' in Dyck's 'Catalogue,' p. 107, where
a very elementary theory of this part of Coradi's planimeter is given, and

also (p. 105) a description of his father's planimeter-without-slipping.
              ON PLANIMETERS.                 515

                             The Lang-Coradi Planimeter.

     Coradi has quite recently constructed a new modification of Amsler's

Polar-planimeter which he calls ' Compensations-Polar-planiineter.' Its
object is to eliminate the error due to a non-parallelism between the axis of

the wheel and the rod QT according to a method due to Herr Lang, a

surveyor of Neuwied. The Swiss patent is dated from October 3, 1893.

A description of it is published by Lang in the ' Zeitschrift fiir Ver-

messungswesen,' 189-1-, Heft 12.
     Lang points out that the error mentioned can be eliminated by going

twice round the boundary of the area in the following manner. To fix

the idea let the pole O of an ordinary Amsler planimeter be below the
Qcurve, the tracer T on it ; then the point will be to the right. In this

position the tracer is moved round the curve. Then, with the same

Qposition of the pole, the planimeter is set so that the point comes to the

left and the tracer is guided again along the curve. The error in question
will be equal but opposite in sign for the two operations, and is therefore

eliminated on taking the mean.

     In Amsler's planimeter this second position is not possible. To make

it possible Coradi does not connect the rod QT by a hinged joint to the

arm OQ, but by a spherical joint. One wheel is placed slightly on one
side of the rod near Q, and another supporting wheel is placed on the
other side of the rod with its axis perpendicular to the rod. The rod
therefore rests with these two wheels at the one end and the tracer at the

other end firmly on the paper. At Q the rod has a hole, with a spherical
bottom, open at the top. The arm OQ has at Q a tooth projecting down-

wards whose spherical end is placed in the hole of the rod. The arm is
therefore above the rod, and this requires a new construction of the needle

point at O. It consists of a heavy foot having its lower surface in the
form of a cylinder whose horizontal edge is perpendicular to OQ. In the
middle of this edge is the needle. This arrangement avoids at the same time
any obliquity in the axis of the joint at Q. Besides, it is easier handled in
taking it in or out of its box, as it consists of two quite separate parts,
and thus there is less likelihood of damaging the instrument.

     It seems to be an instrument as carefully thought out as it is
executed, and will, most likely, replace the more expensive precision-

planimeters.

              The Hine-Robertson Planimeter.

    Within the last few years a new little planimeter has been made by

Messrs. Hine & Robertson, of New York, stated to be ' on an entirely new

principle.' The principle is however already given by Amsler in his paper

of 1856.

Suppose in an ordinary Amsler planimeter a bar CD fixed rigidly at C

QTto the rod  and at right angles to it.  On this bar let a wheel be

mounted so that it can turn about it and also slide along it. Let the

rim of this wheel be made with a knife edge ; then the wheel can only roll
on the paper, but instead of slipping on the paper it will slide along the

bar. If the wheel had a smooth rim and could not move along its axis we

should have the arrangement mentioned before (p. 510), when it was pointed

out that its slipping would equal the ' roll ' of the ordinary recording wheel.

It follows that the displacement of the wheel along the bar equals the

                                                                                   ll2

' roll ' of the ordinary wheel, and can therefore be used in its place to

measure an area.

Amsler describes, in the paper quoted, a planimeter of this kind ; but

instead of making the knife-edge wheel slide along the bar CD, he makes

the bar slide across the rod QT, fixing at each end a knife-edge wheel.

Just as in Amsler's Polar-planimeter the axis of the recording wheel

must be parallel to the rod, so the axis of the knife edge wheel must be

Wperpendicular to it. If it deviates from it by an angle i, and if S
denotes the sliding,  the rolling of the wheel, then the area will be

                      SZ sin £+W^ cos e

In the Hine- Robertson planimeter the point Q is not guided in a circle

but along a straight line. The whole instrument is small, and is contained
in a box seven by eleven inches. At the bottom of the box, along one

edge, a strip of metal is fastened with a V-groove in it. In this the one

Qend of the rod slides. The paper with the indicator-diagram, for which

the instrument is meant to be used, is clamped to the bottom and every-

thing ready. The wheel slides, as described, along the bar, which is so

graduated that the wheel is set to zero when pushed towards the rod as far

as it will go.  The instrument  is  therefore  very  handy                             but  it  has  one
                                                                                    ;
--fault the axis of the wheel is not perpendicular to QT.

The rod is at the end towards Q bent to a curve, and only the piece in

CT, whei'e C is the point of junction with the bar carrying the wheel, is

straight. This bar, which should be perpendicular to QT, is so to CT, and

makes with QT an angle £=10^ nearly. If it gives, nevertheless, good

results this must be due to the fact that the errors nearly cancel each other.

    If the instrument be so placed that CT is parallel to the v-groove,
and the line over which CT lies be marked on the paper, then the error

will be positive when the tracer is on the one side of this line, negative

when on the other. As from the very dimensions of the instrument this line

will almost always cross the indicator-diagram, such cancelling of the

errors will be explained. But there seems to be no reason why the axis

of the wheel should not have its proper position.

plicity, consisting simply of a single rod of metal, without any wheel or
other movable part. For the ultimate reading an ordinary scale is used.

   A metal rod is bent as in fig. 14. At T it ends in a point which

Qserves as tracer. At it is flattened to a knife-edge, whose plane passes
through T. This is placed in a vertical plane with T and Q resting on the

paper.

The knife-edge prevents Q from moving sideways. The only motions

QTpossible are therefore a sliding in the direction of  together with a

turning about Q. Hence, if T is moved along any curve, Q will follow,

always moving towards T. QThe Q-curve, as the path of may be called,

QTis therefore a curve of pursuit. The line  is always tangential to it.

Its length will be denoted by /.

To use this instrument as a planimeter the inventor gives the following

rules :

      If the greatest extension of the area exceeds II the area has to be

divided and the parts measured separately.

Aarea, and join it to a point

Rmake with the knife-edge a mark on the paper. Next guide T from to

A, round the boundary and back to R ; make again a mark with Q, and

measure the distance Cj between these marks. Next turn the instrument

Rtlirough 180° about and guide T as before, but in the opposite sense,

round the boundary. Let the distance between the marks in this case be

    He afterwards gives his theory. This leads him to an integral for the

area swept over by QT, which cannot be worked out in a finite foi-m, and
has to be expanded in an infinite series of which the first terms lead him

to the result stated.

    The same problem has also been treated analytically by Mr. F. W. Hill

in a more elegant manner, the result being given in a slightly different

form.

These investigations are, however, somewhat unsatisfactory. It seems

to me that the following geometrical reasoning affords us a deeper insight

into the real nature of the theory of this instrument.

the tractrix, which will extend to an infinite distance to the right, having

tractrix, which has a cusp at O. QSimilarly, if T describes any curve,
will describe a curve which will have a cusp whenever QT becomes normal

to the T-curve.

    If we decompose a very small displacement of QT during this motion
into a sliding along QT and a turning about Q, then the latter alone will

generate an area, and if the rod turns through a small angle (i the area

generated equals ^Pd^h ^« where a=:ld is the small arc described by T

result, that the area between the tractrix and its asymptote from the cusp

like OSB with a cusp at S (fig. 16).

If the given curve is less simple this Q-curve may be more complicated,

but the following reasoning will always hold.

    The area described by QT is found to be equal to that of the section

OAC, where 00 is parallel to BA. In order to make the Q-curve closed,
A ABsuppose the line QT tui-ned about from
                                             back to AO. Hereby the

BAOsector  OACis described, which equals     both in magnitude and sense,

for the sense of QT is from Q to T ; hence from B to A.

   We have now a cyclical motion for QT. According to Theorem 1
                                                                          --

--(p. 502) the area generated equals (T) (Q), where (T) is the area of the

given curve and (Q) the area of the closed Q-curve, or equal to twice the

sector AOB, i.e., equal to I. a, where a denotes the arc OB. If we now

could vary the proceeding so that (Q):=0 we should have (T)^la, and

need only measure the arc a to get the area of the given curve.

ATo do this draw from any straiglit line AX, place the planimeter in
Aits original position OA, and move T from along AX. The point Q now
AXdescribes a tractrix OF with
                                as asymptote. On doing the same from

            we get a second tractrix, BH, also with                       as

asymptote.

            a suitable point and draw with this point as

EDcentre and TQ as radius an arc  between these two tractrices, we can

Weconsider the curve DOSBED as the Q-curve.          need only start at the

Rturning QT at last about till Q comes back to D.

R EDIf has been well selected the arc    will cut the curve OSB, and

Rposition for such that the area (Q) vanishes.

This shows the possibility of using the simple ' Hatchet ' as a plani-

meter ; but it is not yet a practical instrument. The above shows only :

   We must, in order to get a practically useful rule for determining

R, restrict the superabundance of choice which the above theory leaves

Aus. perfectly satisfactory rule has not yet been found. The only

generally usable one is that given by the inventor.

As the Hatchet Planimeter has during the last few years excited

some interest both in England and abroad, and as I have heard its

invention atti-ibuted to various men, the following historical facts may be

mentioned.

I became acquainted with it early in 1893 through Professor Green-

hill, and ordered one from the maker, Herr Cornelius Knudsen, in Copen-
hagen. With it I received a pamphlet in French dated 1887. It contains

an analytical theory without mentioning Captain Prytz. After my showing

the instrument at the Physical Society and mentioning that a complete

theory did not yet exist, thei-e appeared in ' Engineering ' a paper by

Macfarlane Gi-ay. In consequence of this Captain Prytz contributed his

investigations to the same journal (where his name is changed to Pryty).

It is practically an English translation of the pamphlet mentioned. I
have since seen a new pamphlet with the name of Captain Prytz on it.

In England the instrument seems, however, to have first become known

through Mr. Druitt Halpin, who mentioned it to Professor Unwin,

Professor Goodman, and other engineers about 1889. Professor Goodman
520 KEPOKT-- 1894.

exhibited a somewhat improved form early this year at the Institution of

Civil Engineers.

    He has given the rod between the knife-edge and the tracer the

shape of a circular arc, radius I, and engraved a scale on it, so that it is
possible to measure the arc between the two marks made on the paper

instead of the chord.

     Quite recently (October) I have learnt from Coradi that in December

1893 F. Hohmann communicated the idea of such a planimeter to him,

and also that Professor Ljubomir Kleritj, of Belgrad, had invented a
new planimeter. This is only a modification of Prytz's. In it the
knife-edge is replaced by a knife-edge wheel, whilst the other end rests
on two feet between which the tracer is so placed that its point is just
off the paper. These feet are fastened to a cross-bar which is movable
about a point above the tracer. The instrument thus rests firmly on
three points. Both Professor Unwiri and Coradi have pointed out to

me that it would be an improvement if to Prytz's form a disc be added

as a handle which can turn freely about the tracer. Kleritj 's form

supplies this.

     Just now I have received a reprint from a Servian journal in which

 Professor Szily, of Budapest, has, at the request of Kleritj, developed the

equation to the path of the knife-edge when the tracer moves along the
circumference of a circle. It is dated December 1893. But it does not
seem to advance the curiously interesting theory of the instrument.

     The geometrical considerations given above were started by me and
more fully worked out by Mr. A. Sharp, who has obtained several other

i-esults, which, however, do not yet yield any better practical rules than

 those given by Prytz.

              Linkage Integrators.

J. Amsler (' Vierteljahrsschrift,' 1856, p. 29) describes what he calls a

' Flachenreductor ' (area-reducer), and in connection with this he gives a

theorem about pantographs which deserves notice.

Starting with the fundamental theorem about the generation of an

area by a line of finite length, these theorems are easily obtained.
ABIf we denote by (A B) the area swept over by the line

cyclical motion, by (P) the areas enclosed by the close path of a point P,

then we have

If /i=0, and this case alone we shall follow up, we have
                                   (AB)==(B)-(A)

If we take a third point C on, or off, the line AB, we always have
          (AB)=(B)-(A), (BC)=(C)-(B), (CA)=(A)-(C)

     These give at once

            (AB) + (BC)-1-(CA)=0 and (AB) = (AC)-f(CB)

where account always must be taken of the sense, viz., it is

                    AB = -BA and (AB)= -(BA)

round, then the area swept over by any segment on the line is propor-

tional to the length of the segment.

In Amsler's planimeter, or any planimeter of Type I., the point Q is

the zero-point of the ' rod ' QT.

    Let on this rod a point T' be taken so that QT=^QT' ; then, whilst T'
is guided along the boundary of an area (T'), the point T will descrilje a

closed curve of k times the area (T).

     J. Amsler proposed {Jx., p. 29, 1856) to have a tube inserted at T' per-

pendicular to the paper. At the bottom this carries near the paper a

glass plate with a small circular mark, and at the top a lens. The point

T is now moved so that the mark at T' follows the small curve. The

point T describes a closed curve whose area is registered by the wheel in

square inches, say. The area (T') is therefore registered k times to the same-

Wescale.  have thus a planimeter which registers a magnified area, and

is suitable to measure small areas. The advantage is this. In guiding a

tracer round a curve the motion of the tracer will be more or less jerky.

These jerks at T will be reduced at T'.

     This arrangement, however, has one drawback. The figures desci'ibed

by T and T' are not similar, and this makes it difficult to guide T so that

T' follows a given curve. But this can be overcome as follows : Let us

If OQDC be made a parallelogram and T, O, T' are taken in a line, then

T and T' will describe similar figures.

On this principle the firm Amsler-Laffon has recently constructed a

                    Fig. 18.

planimeter for measuring small areas. For convenience of construction

the points T and T' are made to describe figures which are only approxi-
mately similar, but sufficiently to make it easy to guide the tracer T so

that T' describes a given small curve.

    It seems to me that we have here a new principle for making inte-
grators which might be called linkage integrators ; viz., if we take a linkage
and move one point T along a given curve, then any other point T' will

describe another closed curve whose area is dependent on that of the given

curve.

As a simple example, take a Peaucillier cell with fixed pole (fig. 18).

Oil Methods that have been adopted for Measuring Pressures in the
     Bores of Guns. Bij Captain Sir A. Noble, K.G.B., F.B.8.,

                 [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

The importance of ascertaining, with some approach to accuracy, the

pressures which are developed at various points along the bores of guns
by gunpowder or other propelling agent is so great that a variety of
means have been proposed for their determination, and I j^urpose, in this
paper, to give a very brief account of some of these means, pointing out
at the same time certain difficulties which have been experienced in their

employment, and the errors to which these methods have been in many

cases subject.

     The earliest attempt, by direct experiment, to ascertain pressures deve-
loped by fired gunpowder was that made by Count Rumford in his
endeavour to determine the pressures due to difierent densities of charge.

He assumed, the principles of thermodynamics being then unknown, that

charges fired in a small closed gun-barrel would give pressures identical
with those given by charges doing work both on the projectile and on the
                                    --

524 REPORT-- 1894.

pi'oducts of combustion themselves ; but even this error was a small one
compared with that which led him to adopt, as correct, his extravagant

estimate of the pressures developed.

   --For a density of unity or, in other words, for a charge approximately
--filling a chamber in which it was fired he estimated the pressure at over

101,000 atmospheres, or at 662 tons per square inch.

    He adopted this pressure notwithstanding the great discrepancy which

he found to exist between the two series of experiments which he made,

and he meets the objection that, were the pressure anything approaching
that which he gives, no gun that ever was made would have a chance of
standing by assuming that the combustion of powder is exceedingly slow,

and lasts the whole time occupied by the projectile in passing through

the bore.

    It is sufficiently curious that a man so eminent for his scientific attain-

ments as was Rumfoi-d should have fallen into so great an error, both
because any attempt at calculation would have shown him his mistake,

and because Robins, sixty years earlier, had conclusively proved that with

--the small grain powders then used and it must be remembered that
--Runiford's powder was sporting of very fine grain the whole of the

powder was fired before the bullet was very greatly removed from its seat.

-- --Robins's argument and it is incontrovertible was, that were it otherwise

a much greater energy would be realised from the powder when the
weight of the projectile was doubled, trebled, quadrupled, &c. ; but his
experiments showed that under these circumstances the work done by the

powder was nearly tlie same.
    For other objects, on a much larger scale, and with appliances far

supeiior to those which the great man I have named had at his disposal,

I have had occasion to repeat Robins's experiment, and the results are
interesting. With a charge of 10 lb. of the powder known as R.L.G2

and a shot weighing 30 lb. a velocity of 2,126 f.s., representing an energy

of 971 "6 foot-tons, was attained. The same charge being used, but the
weight of the projectile being doubled, the velocity was reduced to
1,641 f.s., while the energy was increased to 1,125 foot-tons. With a shot
weighing 120 lb. the velocity was 1,209 f.s. and the energy 1,196 foot-tons.
With a shot of 1501b. the velocity was 1,080 f.s. and the energy 1191-5
foot-tons ; while with a shot of 360 lb. the velocity was reduced to 691 f.s.,
representing a muzzle energy of 1,191 '9 foot-tons. These energies were

obtained with maximum chamber pressures respectively of 13'5 tons, of

17'25 tons, of 19 tons, of 20 tons, and of 22 tons per square inch. It will

be noted that the maximum energy obtained was realised with the shot of

1201b. weight, the energy given by a shot of 3601b. i.e. three times

--that weight, or twelve times the weight of the original shot being nearly

exactly the same.

     Very different, however, were the results when one of the modern

powders, introduced with the special object of insuring slow combustion,

was compared with the R.L.G2 experiments which I have just quoted.
    With brown prismatic or cocoa powder an exactly similar series was

foot-tons ;  the 60-lb.  shot gave  1,291 f.s., and an energy of 693-4 foot-tons

attained was 654 f.s., equivalent to an energy of 1,064-7 foot-tons. The

maximum chamber pressures in this series varied from 4-8 tons per square

iiicli, with the lightest projectile, to 9-6 with the heaviest ; and with

this powder it will be observed that the energy developed increased

steadily and considerably with each increment in the weight of the shot,

while the low chamber pressure shows that, even with the heaviest shot,

the projectile must have moved a considerable distance from its seat

before the charge can be considered to have been entirely consumed.

I have mentioned the discrepancy between Rumford's two series of

experiments. This discrepancy was very great, the one series giving, for

a density of unity, a tension of about 190 tons per square inch, or 29,000

atmospiieres, the other series giving a tension of over 101,000 atmospheres.

It is remarkable that Rumford makes no attempt to explain this discre-

pancy, but, as he deliberately adopts the higher tension, it is not impro-

bable that he was led to this conclusion by an erroneous estimate of the

elastic force of the aqueous vapour contained in the powder or formed by

its explosion. He considered, relying on M. de Betancourt's experiments,

that the elasticity of steam is doubled by every addition of temperature

--equal to 30° F., and his only difficulty appears to have been he expresslj'

--leaves to posterity the solution of the problem why the tension of fired

gunpowder is not much higher than even the enormous pressure which

his experiments appeared to indicate.

It will be remembered that Rumford's apparatus consisted of a small

but strong wrought-iron barrel, terminated at one end by a small closed

vent, so arranged that the charge could be tired by the application of a

red-hot ball. At the other end it was closed by a hemisphere upon which

--any required weight could be placed. His method was as follows : -A

given charge being placed in the bore, a weight judged to be equivalent

to the expected gaseous pressure was applied. If the weight were lifted,

it was increased until it was just sufficient to confine the gases, and the

pressure was then assumed to be that represented by the weight.

   --It seems probable that Rumford's erroneous determinations were

mainly due to two causes :

1st. To the weight closing the barrel being lifted, not by the mere

gaseous pressure, but by the products of explosion (produced, it will be

remembered, from a very ' brisante ' powder and considerably heated by the

red-hot ball) being projected at a high velocity against it. In such a

case the energy acquired in traversing the barrel would add notably to

the pressure due to the density of the charge ; and it is again remarkable
that the augmentation of pressure, due to this cause, was clearly indicated

by an experiment designed for the purpose by Robins.

2nd. To the gases acting on a much larger area than was allowed for

in his calculations ; and this view appears to be confirmed by the resume

he gives of his experiments.

No attempt was made for very many years either to corroborate or

amend  Count  Rumford's  determinations                                                            but,  in  1845,  General  Cavalli
                                                                                                ;

endeavoured indirectly to arrive at the pressure developed by different

kinds of powder in a gun of 16 cm. calibre. His method consisted in

drilling holes in the gun at right angles to the axis, at different distances

from the base of the bore, in which holes were screwed small barrels of

wrought iron, so arranged as to throw a bullet which would be acted on

by the charge of the gun while giving motion to the projectile. By ascer-

taining the velocities of these bullets he considered that the theoretical

thickness of the metal at various points along the bore could be deduced.

His experiments led him to some singular results.
                --

--52G REPORT 1894.

    He believed that with some very hrisante Belgian powder with which

he experimented a chamber pressure of 24,022 atmospheres (157"6 tons
per square inch) had actually been reached, while with an ordinary powder

and a realised energy of nearly the same amount the maximum chamber
pressure was only 3,734 atmospheres (24-5 tons per square inch). With

the brisante powder this erroneous conclusion was doubtless due to two

principal causes, viz.

     1st. To the seat of the small bullet being at a considerable distance
from the charge. Under these circumstances, as later on I shall have

occasion to describe experiments to prove, a far higher pressure induces
motion in the bullet than is due to the tension of the gases in a state of

rest.

     2nd. To the brisante nature of the powder. With such powders,

especially in large cliarges, it has been proved that great variations of
pressure exist in the powder chamber itself, in some cases the pressure in-
dicated at one point of the chamber being more than double that at others.

      It has further been proved that with brisante powders waves of
pressure of great violence sweep from one end of the chamber to the other,
and if Cavalli's small bullet were acted on by one of these waves an ex-
ceedingly high pressure would, without doubt, be indicated.

    A3rd. third cause of error, but much slighter, is due to the muzzle

pressure, when the small bullet quits its barrel, being both abnormally high
and also abnormally sustained ; hence there will be a considerable incre-
ment of velocity after the bullet quits tlie gun.

     It is but fair to add that the results obtained by Cavalli with the
powders which he terms ' inoffensive ' are, if some correction be made for
the third cause of error alluded to above, not far i-emoved from the truth.

   A Prussian Artillery Committee, under the presidency of General

Neumann, made, in 1854, a great improvement on the plan proposed and
employed by Cavalli.

     Their mode of procedure consisted in drilling a hole in the powder
chamber of the gun to be expei'imented with, in which hole was placed a
small barrel of about six inches in length. Now, when the gun was
loaded, if in the small barrel were placed a cylinder of a length equal to
that of the projectile, it is clear that, on the assumption that the pressure
in the powder chamber is uniform, the cylinder and the projectile will
describe equal spaces in equal times ; hence, if we determine the velocity
of the cylinder when it quits the small barrel, we know the velocity of the
projectile when it -has moved six inches from its seat. By altering the
length of the column of the cylinder placed in the small barrel, and ascer-
taining the resultant velocity, the velocity of the projectile at any desired

point of the bore can be determined.
     General Neumann's Committee carried out their experiments only in

very small guns and with the grained powder used in those days. Their
results were probably not far from the truth, although subject to one of
the defects to which I alluded in reviewing General Cavalli's experiments.
Indeed, these results were examined and entirely contirmed by the dis-
tinguished Russian artillerist General Mayevski, in a very elaborate
memoir but the experiments of the Prussian Committee were chiefly

                                     ;

remarkable for being, so far as I know, the first to recognise the variation.?

of pressure which may exist in the powder chamber itself, variations which

may, under certain circumstances, attain great magnitude, and to whiclj
I have already drawn attention.
                                                                   ·

ON METHODS FOR MEASURING PRESSURES IN THE BORES OV GUNS. 527

     The results of the Prussican experiments showed, with every charge
fired, two distinct maxima of tension. Other relative maxima no doubt
existed, but the mode of experimenting was not sufficiently delicate to
render them perceptible.

     Before passing to the more modern methods adopted for determining-
the tensions in guns, I must advert to one which has been repeatedlv
resorted to during the last 150 years. I mean the method of tiring the
same weight of charge and projectile from guns of the same calibre but of
different lengths, or, as has sometimes been done, by successively reducino-
the length of the same gun by cutting oft" a determinate number of
calibres from the muzzle.

     It is obvious that if, under the circumstances supposed, we know the
muzzle velocities of a projectile from a gun of, say, twenty-five calibres in
length and from a gun of thirty calibres in length, we are able from the
increased energy obtained to deduce the mean pressure acting upon the

projectile over the additional five calibres.

     The earliest experiments with different lengths of guns appear to have
been made in England as far back as 1736. These experiments, however,
have but little value, as the velocities were not directly determined, and
could only be deduced from the observed ranges. The same objection applies

to the long series of experiments carried on in Hanover in 1785, and those
cited by Piobert in 1801 ; but the interesting observation that the ranges
obtained from guns of twelve, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty- three calibres in
length were relative maxima cannot be relied on in any way as showing
abnormal variations in the muzzle pressure accompanying variations in

length.

     In Hutton's experiments, made with guns varying in length from

fifteen to forty calibres, the muzzle velocities were obtained by means of

the  ballistic  pendulum                                           and,  between  these  limits  of  length,  the  mean
                                                                ;

powder pressure he realised can with sufficient certainty bo deduced.

     This remark applies also to the numerous similar experiments where

the muzzle velocities have been obtained by the more accurate chrono-

scopes that have been for many years in common use ; but this mode of
determining the pressure has many inconveniences, and ceases to be reliable

when the bore is of a very reduced length and the pressures approach
their maximum value.

     To the important and extensive series of experiments carried on by

Major Rodman for the United States Government in 1857 to 1859, the

main object of the experiments being to ascertain the effect which the
size of grain of the powder used has upon the pressure, we are indebted

for that officer's most ingenious pressure gauge ; and tlie crusher gauge,

which is now so extensively used, can only be considered a modification of
Major Rodman's instrument designed to remove certain difficulties at-

tending the use of the original instrument.

     Major Rodman's gauge is well known, but its construction is shown in

--the accompanying drawing (fig. 1). Major Rodman applied his gauge

in the following manner :

      Desiring to ascertain the pressure at various points along the bore of a
gun, he bored at these points channels to the interior surface of the bore,

and in these channels cylinders with small holes drilled down the centre were

inserted ; to this cylinder is fitted the indicating apparatus, carried by

Major Rodman on the outside of the gun, and consisting of an indentino-

tool G with its knife (shown in elevation and section). Against the knife
--.528

is screwed a piece of copper, ii. The pressure of the gas acting on the

piston I forces the knife into the copper ; by mechanical means a similar

cut can be produced, and hence the magnitude of the cut gives the measure

Aof the pressure which has produced it.  small cup at c prevents any

gas passing the indenting tool.

The great improvements that Major Rodman made in gunpowder are

well known. To him we are indebted both for the earliest experiments

on the effect of the size of grain on tlie maximum pressure and for the

powder adopted by all nations for large guns, I mean prismatic powder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but it is a question whether he was not in some degree led to these great

improvements by an erroneous estimate of the pressures produced, this

erroneous estimate being mainly due to the necessity of placing the

Rodman gauge at the exterior of the gun ; and the efl'ect of this objec-

tionable position would be greatly exaggerated if the powder experimented

with were of a brisante nature.

It is curious that so distinguished an artillerist as Major Rodman

should never have taken the trouble to calculate what energies the
pressures which his instrument gave would have generated in a pro-
iectile ; had he done so he would have found that many of the results
indicated by his instrument were not only improbable but were absolutely

impossible.

    As an illustration of Major Rodman's method I take an interesting
series of experiments made in smooth-bored guns of 7-inch, 9-inch, and

1 1 -inch calibres, and so arranged that in each gun an equal column or
weight per square inch of powder was behind an equal column or weight
per square inch of projectile. Under these conditions, in each gun, during
the passage of the shot along the bore, the gases would be equally ex-
panded, and the energy per unit of column developed at every point in
the three guns should be the same, except for slight differences on account
of increased temperature and pressure in the larger guns, due to the
smaller cooling surface in proportion to the weight of charge.

    Major Rodman measured his pressures at the base of the bore and at
                         --

530 EEPORT-- 1894.

the Rodman gauge gave pressures varying from 2-i-G to 38"9 tons per

square inch.
      In the second series, all conditions being the same, except that the

charge was fired from the extreme rear, the maximum chronoscope
pressure was 14 '3 tons, while the Rodman pressure varied from ol-G
tons per square mch to over 50 tons per square inch, that pressure being

the highest which the instrument was capable of registering, every obser-
vation in this series with the gauge placed at the seat of the shot being

over fifty tons.

     Shortly afterwards the Rodman gauges were destroyed, two of them

being blown from the gun.
     These discrepancies led the Committee to investigate with certain

powders the variation in pressure indicated when a gauge was placed at
the surface of the bore and at the exterior of the gun as with the Rodman

gauge.

     For this purpose they used the crusher gauge, which admits of being-
placed in both positions.

     With pebble powdor the gauge placed at the interior of the bore gave
14'5 tons; placed under precisely tJie same conditions at the exterior
it gave 27 tons per square inch. With R.L.G. the similar figures were
re.spectively 20 and HZ tons, and with L.G. respectively 19'5 and 45"5 tons

per square inch.

      The error I have just discussed was due to the position of the gauge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but R,odman's pressures and the pressures of the Explosive Committee
were exaggerated from another cause. It will be readily understood that
if a pressure of, say, 20 tons per square inch be suddenly applied to a
gauge, and if the resistance to the motion of the knife be initially trifling,
a certain amount of energy will be communicated to the piston and knife

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and the copper when measured will indicate not only the gaseous pressure,
but in addition a pressure corresponding to the energy impressed upon

the piston during its motion.
     This cause of eiTor can, however, be eliminated by producing beforehand

by mechanical means a cut indicating a pressure a little less than that to
be expected.

     Rodman admits that his chase pressures are erroneous ; their ex-

aggeration is no doubt greatly due to the causes I have just pointed

out ; but in my opinion, based upon long experience, no gauge of tlli^<

description placed in the chase, where the products of explosion arc
moving with a very high velocity, can be depended upon to give reliable

results.

     If we disregard the energy of the moving products and suppose thi-,
gauge to be acted on by pure gaseous pressure, with a projectile moving
at the rate of 2, .500 f.s. (and such velocities are now quite within tluf

range of practical ballistics), the projectile would pass the entrance to the

Rodman gauge in something like the ^7,-J^,,,,t]i part of a second. It is

difficult to imagine that the full indentation could be given to the copper
in this small fraction of time, and, if it were not so given, the gauge
would indicate the pressure at a point considerably in advance of the
gauge.

    On the other iuind, if, as would generally be the case, the products of

explosion moving at a high velocity acted on the piston, the energy of
these products would be reconverted into pressure, and the gauge would

in this case give too high a result.
ON METHODS FOR MEASURING PRESSURES IN THE BORES OF GUNS, ool

    Majoi" Rodman appears to have considered it impossible that any

gauge could rightly indicate a pressure liigher than that indicated by

another nearer to the seat of the shot. This, however, is not so ; nothing-

is more certain than that, with the powders known as 'Poudres brutales,'
and, possibly, in a less degree with all explosives, motion is communicated
to the shot by a series of waves or impulses ; and it is easy to see that, if

the position of a gauge coincided with the ' hollow ' of a wave, while that of
a more forward gauge coincided with the ' crest,' the latter might easily
show the higher pressure. Later on I shall revert to this point.

    The crusher gauge is a modification of the Rodman gauge, designed
to overcome some of the defects of that instrument, and it is now almost

universally used for the direct measurement of pressure : it is shown in
the diagram exhibited (fig. 2), and its action is easily understood. The powder
gases act upon the base of the piston, compressing the copper cylinder ;

the amount of crush on the cylinder serves as an index to the maximum

tension acting on the piston. It is usual, where possible, to employ in
each experiment two or three gauges so as to check the accui'acy of the

determination. Properly used, very great confidence may be placed in
their results ; but, as may be gathered from my remarks on the Rodman

                           --Fig. 2. Crusher Gauo:e.

gauge, this and all similar gauges will cease to give reliable information
as to the energy th.at can be impressed on a projectile, or as to the mean
pressure on tlie surface of the bore, if there be any probability of the
products of explosion being projected into them at a high velocity. In
such a case the pressure indicated would not be the true gaseous pressure,
such as, for instance, would exist were the products of ignition retained
in a vessel impervious to heat until the waves of pressure generated by
the explosion had subsided. But I defer an examination of the results
given by the crusher gauge until I compare these results witli those given
by the indirect method of deducing the pi'essure from the motion of the
projectile within the bore.

      The method I have adopted for this purpose consists in registering the
times at which a projectile passes certain fixed points in the bore of a gun.
The chronoscope (figs. 3 and 4), which I have designed for this purpose has
been so often described that I shall only here briefly allude to it. It consists
of a series of thin discs made to rotate at a very high and uniform velocity
through a train of geared wheels. The speed with which the circum-
 ference of the discs travels is between 1,200 and 1,300 inches per second,
and, since by means of a vernier we are able to divide the inch into

                                                                                    MM2

thousandths, the instrument is capable of recording the millionth part of

a second.

     The precise rate of the discs' rotation is ascertained from one of the
intermediate shafts, which, by means of a relay, registers the revolution
on a subsidiary clironoscope, on which, also by a relay, a chronometer
registers seconds. The subsidiary chronoscope can be read to about the

  ^\,,i th part of a second.

     The registration of the passage of the shot across any of the fixed
points in the bore is effected by the severance of the primary of an in-
duction coil causing a spark from the secondary, which writes its record

on prepared paper gummed to the periphery of the disc. The time is thus

registered every round at sixteen points of the boi'e.
     In the earlier experiments with this instrument the primary was cut

by means of the arrangement shown in fig. 5, and this was entirely
satisfactory when velocities of from 1,400 to 1,600 f.s. were in ques-
tion. But with the Aery high velocities now employed, with velocities,
for example, between 2,.500 and 3,500 f.s., the knife, instead of being
knocked down, frequently cuts a long groove in the cast-iron projectile.

on some occasions reaching the driving band of the shot before being

forced into its place.

    On account of this defect I haAe in all recent experiments adopted

the arrangement shown in fig. 6, which giAes extremely satisfactory results,
if care be taken that the plug is sufficiently secured to prevent its being
forced out of its place by the rush of conii^ressed air displaced by the

passage of a projectile.
     I have ascertained by experiments which I need not here describe that

the mean instrumental error of this chronoscope, due chiefly to the
deflection of the spark, amounts only to about three one-millionths of a

second.

     I must not conceal the fact that the determination of the pressure by
this method is attended with very great labour. As an illustration I
have prepared a diagram (fig. 7) of a I'ecent set of experiments. Usually the
pressures are deduced from the mean of three consecutive rounds fired
under the same circumstances.

     In this case, owing to the bore being clean, a much higher velocity
Avas obtained from the first round, and the velocities and pressures were
therefore calculated both for the mean and independently for each of the

three rounds.

     The first curves represented in the diagram are the time curves. So

far as the eye can see, the time curves in all cases pass through the

observed points. From the time curves the velocity curves are deduced,
and I have given for each velocity curve the observed velocities, so that

the accordance of the computed curve with the observed velocities will be
seen. The velocity curve being fixed, the pressure curve of necessity
follows, and the diagram shows both the accordance of the two rounds
fired under the same circumstances, and the slight discordance in the

tinctly shown.

may be taken as very approximately correct, but it cannot be relied on t&
give accurate results when placed in positions where the products of

explosion are moving with a high velocity.

     The maximum pressures under the conditions I havg supposed are
very approximately confirmed by the chronoscope, as may be seen by

comparing the pressures shown on the diagram giving the results as to
pressure obtained with certain new explosi-\'es, to which I shall presently

advert. As a general rule it may be said that, where the powders are
slow in lighting and no wave action exists, the chronoscope pressures are

generally somewhat higher than those of the crusher gauge ; but the case
is very difierent where the powder is of a highly explosive or quick-
burning description. With such powders not only are the crusher-gauge
pressures greatly above those of the chronoscope, but the widest difierence
frequently exists between the pressures indicated in diflTerent parts of the

chamber in the same experiment. The pressurep:, moreover, arc often

greatly above those which would exist were the charge absolutely confined

in a close vessel.

   A very striking instance may be cited from the early experiments of

the Explosive Committee with a M.L. 10-inch gun (fig. 8). The first round

was fired with a charge of 87^ lb. Belgian Pebble, the charge Ijeing lighted

in two places. The maximum pressure with the chronoscope was 25*2
tons. With the crusher gauge the pressure in the chamber varied from

22"2 to 24:"8 tons per square inch, while the energy developed by the

powder on the shot was 6,240 foot-tons. With the second round, all con-

ditions being the same except that the charge was fired at a single point,

the chronoscope pressure was as nearly as possible the same ; but the

chamber pressure was, at the rear, 79-1 tons ; in the middle 52-0 tons ; at

Athe seat of the shot 39-5 and 48-0 tons per square inch.  similar large

excess of pressure was shown at points 1 foot and 2 feet in advance of the

.seat of the shot, and the crusher gauges did not show their normal pres-

sures until points 5 or 6 feet from the seat of the shot had been reached.
     Yet with the violent difference in pressure shown betweeii the crusher

gauges in this round and in the previous round (which I have just cited),

--Fig. S. Position of Pressure Plugs in 10-inch Gun.

                                     C 2 46

the difference of energy developed in the shot was exceedingly trifling,

being only 6,249 foot-tons, as against 6,240.

    I believe I have expressed pretty clearly my views that crusher

gauges placed in the chase are for absolute determination not of much
value, and their main use, if used at all, is to give comparative results.
But the same remark does not apply to crusher gauges placed in the

chamber.

     Gases moving at a high velocity in the chase are, so to speak, perform-
ing their proper function ; but the same is not true of those violent waves
of pressure in the chamber which appear to accompany the explosion of
all brisante powders, and which occur either when the projectile has hardly
moved at all or when it is moving with a comparatively slow velocity.

     It is our object, and in this we have had great success, to avoid these
waves as much as possible ; and in attaining this end our indebtedness to
the crusher gauge is very great, as this instrument has made plain to us

not only the extreme violence but the variability of these oscillations.
     I have heard it urged that these waves of pressure are, after all, not of

high importance, because their maxima act at the same time only upon a
very small section of the bore, and the continuity of the metal is amply

sufficient to resist the stress.
--540 KEPORT 1894.

     This is 110 doubt true, but it is not true of the base of the bore, which
in modern guns is almost invariably a movable piece, and which under
certain circumstances might have to sustain the full force of the violent
pressures, a sample of which I have cited.

    To ascertain the mean pressure throughout the bore it seems to me

that there is no method so satisfactory, despite its attendant labour, as
that of making the projectile write its own story. In that case we cannot
fall into the error of making the pressures three or four times as great as
are necessary to generate the energy the projectile has actually acquired,
while occasional errors, due to causes I have not time to explain, are
easily detected and eliminated.

     To give an idea of how great is the range of velocity over wliich these

experiments have been carried, I exhibit here diagrams (tigs. 9 and 10) show-
ing the velocities and pressures obtained with several of the new explosives

which in recent years have attracted so much attention. Observe also how

closely, with the exception of the one somewhat brisante powder, the
results given by the chronoscope accord with those given by the crusher
gauge. Where these differ, as I have elsewhere pointed out, the two modes
of research so widely different are complementary to each other.

     The chronoscope takes little or no note of the violent oscillations of

pressure acting during exceedingly minute intervals of time. On the
other hand, if with the explosives I allude to we trusted to the indications
of the crusher gauge, we should arrive at a most erroneous idea of the

energy communicated to the projectile.

    In concluding, if I may venture to quote the excuse of a much more
eminent man than myself, I have only to express my regret that I have not

had time to condense the remarks with which I fear I have fatigued you,

while at the same time I am aware that there are many important points
in connection with my subject which I have left altogether untouched,

and others upon which I have touched that require further elucidation.

    --President op the Section Professor A. W. Euceek, M.A., P.R.S.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

      The President delivered the followiug Address :
It is impossible for a body of English scientific men to meet in one of our
ancient university towns without contrasting the old ideal of the purEiiit of
learning ibr its own sake with the modern conception of thu organisation of
science as part of a pushing business concern.

   We are, as a nation, convinced that education is essential to national success.

Our modern universities are within earshot of the whirr of the cotton-mill or the
roar of Piccadilly. Oxford and Cambridge themselves are not content to be
centres of attraction to which scholars gravitate. They have devised schemes
by which their influence is directly exerted on every market town and almost on
every village in the country. University extension is but a part of the extra-
ordinary multiplication of the machinery of education which is going on all around
us. The British Association, which was once regarded as bringing light into dark
pLices, is now welcomed in every large provincial town by a group of well-known

men of science ; and we find ready for the meetings of our Sections, not only the

chapels and concert-rooms which have so often and so kindly been placed at our
disposal, but all the appliances of well-designed lecture-rooms and laboratories.

     I do not propose, however, to detain you this morning with a discourse on the

spread of scientific education, but you will forgive me if I illustrate its progress

by two facts, not perhaps the most striking which could be selected, but especially
appropriate to our place of meeting. It is little more than thirty years since the
two branches of science with which our .Section deals. Mathematics and Physics,
have been generally recognised as wide enough to require more than one teacher
to cope with them in an educational institution of high pretensions and achieve-
ment. In 1860 the authorities of the Owens College, Manchester, debated whether
it was desirable to create a Professorship of Natural Philosophy in addition to, and
independent of, the Chair of Mathematics. It was thought necessary to obtain

external support for the opinions of those who advocated this step. An appeal

was made to Professors l)e Morgan and Stokes. The former reported that a

'course of experimental physics is in itself desirable;' the latter, that 'there

would be work enough in a large institution for a mathematician and a physicist.'
     In the end the Chair of Natural Philosophy was established, and the fact that

our host of to-day, Professor Clifton, was its first occupant reminds us how little
we have advanced in time and how far in educational developmout from the days
--544 REPORT 1894.

when propositions such as those I have cited were only accepted on the authority
of the names of Stokes and De Morgan.

     The other fact to which I would refer is that the Clarendon Laboratory, in

Awhich the meetings of Section are to be held, though erected barely a quarter of

a century ago, was the first laboratory in this country which was specially built
and designed for the study of experimental physics. It has served as a type.
Clerk Maxwell visited it while planning the Cavendish Laboratory, and traces of

Professor Clifton's designs can be detected in several of our university colleges.

     But though our surroundings remind us of the improvement which has been
effected in the equipment of our science, it would not be difficult to indicate weak

--points which should forthwith be strengthened. On these, in so far as they affect

education, I will not dwell and that for two reasons. In the first place, we meet
to-day not as teachers, but as students ; and, secondly, I think that whereas we

-- --have as a nation awoke though late in the day to the importance of education,

we are not yet fully awake to the importance of learning. Our attitude in such
matters was exactly expressed by one of the most eminent of the witnesses who

"ave evidence before the ' Gresham Commission.' In his opinion the advancement
of knowledge must in a university in London be secondary to tlie higher instruc-

-- --tion of the youth of London. If this be so and I will not now dispute it we

shall surely all agree that somewhere or other, in London or out of it, included in
our universities or separate from them, there ought to be institutions in which the
advancement of knowledge is regarded as of primary and fundamental interest, and
not as a mere secondary by-product thrown off in the course of more important

operations.

      It is not essential that in such an institution research should be the only taslc.

Investigation may be combined with the routine work of an observatorj', with

teaching, with the care of standards, or witli other similar duties. It is, however,
essential that, if the advancement of knowledge is seriously regarded as an end

worth attaining, it should not be relegated to a secondary place.
     Time and opportunity must be found for investigation, as time and opportunity

are found for other tasks. It is not enough to refer to research in a prospectus and
then to leave it to be accomplished at odd times and in spare moments not claimed
b}^ more urgent demands. Those to wlioiu the future of the higher learning in
England is dear must plan and scheme to promote the life-long studies of men, as
in the last quarter of a century they have struggled, with marked success, to
promote the preparatory studies of boys and girls. That the assignment of a
secondary position to research is the more popular view, and that the necessity for

encouraging it has as yet hardly been gi-asped by many of those who control our
modem educational movements is, I fear, too true. It is therefore a matter for

congratulation that within the last j-ear Oxford has established a research degree,

and has thus taken an important step towards gathering within her fold workers

of mature years who are able and willing, not merely to gain knowledge, but to

add to it.

    We may also note, with pleasure and gratitude, that the stream of private

munificence has recently been in part directed to the advancement of learning.
Sir Henry Thompson has generously offered a sum of 5,000/. to provide a
large photographic telescope for the National Observatory at Greenwich. The

new instrument is to be of 26 inches aperture and 22 feet Ij inches focal length, or
exactly double the linear dimensions of that which has been previously employed.
Mr. Ludwig Mond, too, has added to his noble gifts to science by the new
research laboratories which he is about to establish in connection with the Royal

Institution. Albemarle Street is thronged with memories of great discoveries.
The researches of Lord Rayleigh and the remarkable results of Professor Dewar's
studies of matter at low temperatures are maintainina: the great reputation which
the Royal Institution has gained in the past, and all English physicists will rejoice

that prospects of new and extended usefulness are opening before it.

      Another hopeful, though very embarrassing, fact is that the growth in the
number of scientific workers makes it increasingly difficult to find the funds

which are necessary for the publication of their work. Up to the present the
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.              545

author of a paper has had to submit it to criticism, but, when it has been ap-

proved by competent jud^'es, it has been published without ado and without

expense to himself. This is as it should be. It is lijrht that due care should be

exercised to prune away all unnecessary matter, to reduce as far as mav be the

necessary cost. It will, however, be a great misfortune if judgment as"to what

curtailment is necessary is in future passed, not with the object of removing what

is really superfluous, but in obedience to the iron rule of poverty. Apart from

all other disadvantages, such a course would add to the barriers which are
Adividing the students of different .sciences.
                                                   few lines and a rough diagram may

suffice to show to experts what has been attempted and what achieved, but

there is no paper so difficult to master as that which assumes that the reader

starts from the point of vantage which montbsor years of study have enabled

the author to attain. Undue pruning will not make the tree of knowledge more

fruitl'u^, and will certainly make it harder to climb.

Connected also with the vast increase of scientific literature is a growing

necessity for the publication of volumes of abs^.racts, in which the main results of

recent investigations are presented in a concentrated form. English chemists have

long been supplied with these by the Chemical Society. The Physical Society,

Wethough far less wealthy than its elder sister, has determined to undertake a
similar task.  are compelled to begin cautiously, but in January next the first

number of a monthly pamphlet will be issued containing abstracts of all the papers

·which appear in the principal foreign journals of Physics. In this venture the

Society will incur gi-ave responsibilities, and I avail myself of this opportunity to

appeal to all Biitish physicists to support us in a work, the scope of which will

be rapidly extended if our first efforts succeed.

From this brief glance at what has been or is about to be done to promote

the study of Physics, I must now turn to the discussion of narrower but more

definite problems, and I presume that I shall be most likely to deserve your

attention if I select a subject in which I am myself especially interested.

    During the last ten years my friend Dr. Thorpe and I have been engaged

upon a minute magnetic survey of the United Kingdom. The main conclusions
at which we have arrived are about to be published, and I do not propose to
recount them now. It is, however, impossible to give so long a time to a single

research without having one's attention drawn to a number of points whi'ch

require further investigation, and I shall perhaps be making the best use of this

opportunity if I bring to your notice some matters in the practical and theoretical

study of terrestrial magnetism which deserve a fuller consideration than has yet

been given to them.

      In the first place, then, there is little doubt that the instruments at present
used for measuring Declination and Horizontal Force are affected with errors far
greater than the error of observation.

    We employed four magnetometers by Elliott Brothers, which were frequently

compared with the standard instrument at Kew. These measurements proved that
the_ instrumental differences which afl'ect the accuracy of the declination and
horizontal force measurements are from five to ten times as great as the error of
a single field observation. The dip circle which two generations ago whs so
untrustworthy is, in our experience, the most satisfactory of the absolute instru-

ments.

     In most cases these comparisons extended over several days, but the

Astronomer Royal has described in his recent report observations made at Green-
wich for two years and a half with two horizontal force instruments. These
differ between themselves, and the discrepancy is of the same order of magnitude
as those we have detected.

KewIf such difiereaces exist between instruments of the  pattern, it is

probable that they will be still greater when the magnetometers under inv'estio-a-
                                                         ""
tion are of different types.

    This point has been investigated by Dr. Van Rijckevorsel, who five years ago
visited Kew, Pare St. Maur, Wilhelmshaven, and Utrecht, and, using his own

instruments at each place, compared the values of the magnetic elements deter-

mined by himself with those deduced from the self- registering apparatus of the

observatory.

     The discrepancies between the so-called standards, which were thus brought
to light, were quite startling, and prove the necessity for au investigation as to

their causes.

     Magnetlcians had long been aware that the instruments used by travellers
should be compared at the beginning and end of a journey with those at some
fixed observatory, to make sure that the comparatively rough usage to which thoy
are subjected has not affected their indications. But Dr. Van Eijckevorsel's

expedition first drew general attention to the fact that there are serious differences

between the standard observatory instruments themselves.
     The importance of a careful comparison between them was at once recognised.

The Magnetic Sub-Committee of the International Meteorological Conference, held

at Munich in the autumn of 1891, resolved that it is ' necessary that the instru-

ments employed for absolute measurements at the different observatories should

be compared with each other and the results published.' As far as I am aware,

nothing has been done to give effect to this resolution, but the necessity for such
an international comparison is urgent. The last few years have been a period of

unexampled activity in the conduct of local magnetic surveys. To cite instances
from the north-west of Europe only, observations have recently been made on a
more or less extended scale in the United Kingdom, France, Holland, North

Germany, and Denmark.
     It will be absurd if these surveys cannot be collated and welded into a homo-

geneous whole, because we are in doubt whether the indications of our standard

instruments for the measurement of declination and dip differ by five or six

minutes of arc.
     If, however, an official international comparison of the magnetic standards iiii

use in different countries is instituted, it is probal^le that only one observatory in

each country will take part in it.

     It may fairly be left to each nation to determine for itself the relations between
the results of measurements made in its own institutions. Apart, therefore, from
all other reasons, we in England would only be able to make the best use of an
international comparison if we had beforehand set our own house in order, and

were able at once to extend the results of experiments made at Kew or Greenwich

to Stonyhurst, Yalentia, and Falmouth.

    This we are not at the present moment in a position to do. As far as I know,

nobody has ever carried a magnetometer backwards and forwards between Kew

and Greenwich to test the concordance of the published results. During the
recent survey single or double sets of observations have been made at Stonyhurst,

Falmouth, and Valentia, with instruments which have been compared with Kew ;

but these measurements, though amply sufficient for the purposes of our research,

were not numerous enough to serve as a firm basis for determining the discrepancies

between the various standards, so that the exact relations between these important

sets of apparatus are still unknown.
     The first point, therefore, to which I wish to draw the attention of the Section

is the necessity for a full primary comparison between the standard magnetic

instruments in use at our different observatories.

But, if this were satisfactorily accomplished, the question would arise as to
Wewhether it should be repeated at regular intervals.
                                                       have at present only

a presumption in favour of the view that the standards which we know are
Adiscordant are nevertheless constant.
                                        single instance may suffice to show how
--necessary it may be at all events in the case of outlying and isolated observatories
--to put this belief to the test.
In the most recent account of the work of the observatory of the Bombay

Government at Colaba, the dips are discussed for the period of twenty yeais

between 1872 and 1892. During this interval the adjustment of the agate plates

upon which the dip needle rolls has thrice been modified. In 1877 the plates

were renewed. In 1881 and 1887 the dip circle was taken to pieces and rebuilt.

In the intervals the dip as determined by several needles, but always with this
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  547

 circle, remained approximately constant, but after each overhauling it suddenly
 altered, increasing by 12' on the first occasion, by 23' on the second, and by 20'
 on the third. Mr. Chambers states that he ' can give no satisfactory account of
 this behaviour of the instrument,' but suggests that 'the needle gradually hollows
 out a depression in the agate plates on vfhich it rolls, and that this characteristic
 of the dip circle ' has not before been discovered owin? to the reluctance of
 magnetic observers to interfere vyith the adjustments of instruments v?hich are
 apparently working well.

      I do not think that this explanation will suffice. Dr. Thorpe and I employed a

new dip circle in the earliest part of our survey work, which has remained in accord

with Kew for ten years. During that time the dip has been measured some 700 times

with it. This corresponds, I believe, to more than the amount of work done with the
circle at Colaba in six years, which in turn is longer than some of the intervals in
which the Colaba instruments gave results erroneous to the extent of 20'. I feel,
therefore, quite sure that the difficulties which have been experienced at Bombay
are not due to any ' characteristic [defect] of the dip circle.' But, whatever the
cause may have been, surely the lesson is that, if such things can happen in so well-
known an institution, it is desirable that we should take the moderate pains

--required to assure ourselves whether smaller but, possibly, not unimportant

errors are gradually atiecting the results at any of our observatories.

    This brings me to my next point, namely, that if we are to draw conclusions
from the minor differences between measurements of secular or diurnal change made
in the observatories, it is not only necessary that we should know whether the

instruments are strictly comparable and constant, but the observations must be
reduced by precisely the same methods.

     In 188G the late Mr. Whipple drew the attention of the British Association to
the fact that there was a systematic difi'erence between the diurnal ranges of
declination at Greenwich and Kew. His results were based on the three years

1870-72. In 1890 two of my students, Messrs. Robson and S. W. J. Smith, ex-

tended the comparison to three more recent years (1883-6-7), and obtained results
in complete accord with those of Mr. Whipple.

     It is well known that the average daily oscillation of the magnet is affected by
the magnetic weather. Sabine showed that magnetic storms do not merely buffet

--the needle now in this direction and now in that they affect its average behaviour,

so that the mean swing east and west is different according as we deduce it only

from days of magnetic calm or include tho.se of storm.

    Mr. Whipple reduced the Kew observations by two methods,' one of which

depended on the calmest days only, while the other included those which were
moderately disturbed. Neither agreed exactly with the method in use at Green-
wich, but the difference between the results deduced from them was so small when
compared with the difference between either and that obtained at Greenwich, that
it seemed possible that the diurnal variations, even at these closely neighbouring

places, might differ appreciably. The question whether this is so has now been

answered. In 1890, at the request of the Kew Committee, the Astronomer Royal

undertook to select early in each year five quiet days in each of the preceding
twelve months. It was also agreed that, whether they adopted other methods or

not, the chief English magnetic observatories should determine the diurnal varia-

tions from these days alone. The Greenwich^ and Kew observations for 1890 have

therefore been worked up in exactly the same way, with the result that the dis-
crepancy, which had persisted for twenty years, has entirely disappeared, and
that the two diurnal ranges at the two observatories are in as close accord as

could bo expected.

    If, therefore, we may judge from a single year, the cause of the difference lay in

--the choice of days. Greenwich will in future gi%'e us two diurnal variations one

obtained from the most quiet days only, the other from all days except those
of violent storm, and in these we shall have most valuable data for studying the
mean effect of distuibances on the diurnal variation.

   ' Sabine's and Wild's.
   - The Greenwich observations for subsequent years have not yet been published.

                                                                                                           NN2
--548 REPORT 1894.

    To tills satisfactory conclusion I have only one suggestion to add. The
Astronomer Royal and M. Mascart now publish for the same stormy days the

photographic traces by which the history of a magnetic storm is mapped. la it

possible lor Greenwich and Paris also to agree in their choice of calm days for
the calculation of the diurnal variation, so that a precise similarity of method

may obtain not only between the English observatories, but between England and

France ?

     The importance of co-operation between institutions engaged on the same tasks

having been illustrated, I am glad to be able to announce that another step is

about to be taken in the same direction. For some years, in spite, I believe, of

great tinancial difficulties, the Cornwall Royal Polytechnic Society has maintained

a magnetic observatory at Falmouth. The results of the observations have hitherto
been printed in the Journal of the Society only, but the Royal Society has now

Kewconsented to publish them in the ' Proceedings.' Before long, therefore, the

and Falmouth records, which are already worked up in the same way, will be given

to the world side by side. Is it too much to hope that this may be the first step

towards the production of a British Magnetic Year Book, in which observations
whose chief interest lies in their comparison may be so published as to be easily

compared ?

   We owe to private enterprise another advance of the same kind. The

managers of the new journal ' Science Progress' have made arrangements with

the Kew Committee for the yearly publication of a table showing the mean annual

values of the magnetic elements as determined at the various magnetic observa-

tories of the world. It will therefore in i'uture be possible to get a general idea of
the rate of secular change in different localities without searcliing through a

number of reports in different languages, which can only be consulted in the rooms
of the few societies or institutions to which they are annually sent. The present

state of our knowledge of the secular change in the magnetic elements attbrds

indeed very strong support to the arguments I have already adduced in favour of

a comparison between the instruments of our magnetic observatories.

    The whole question of tlie cause of this phenomenon has entered on a new

stage. It has long been recognised that the earth is not a simple magnet, but that

there are in each hemisphere one pole or point at which the dip needle is vertical,

Aand two foci of maximum intensity.  comparison of earlier with later magnetic

observations led to the conclusion that one or both of the foci in each hemisphere

-- --is in motion, and that to this motion however caused the secular change in the

values of the magnetic elements is due. Thus the late Professor Balfour Stewart,

writing in 1883, says : ' While there is no well-established evidence to show that

either the pole of verticity or the centre of force to the North of America has

perceptibly changed its place, there is on the other hand very strong evidence to
show that we have a change of place on the part of the Siberian focus.' ' The i'acts
in favour of this conclusion are there discussed. The arguments are based, not on

the results of any actual observations near to the focus in question, but on the
behaviour of the magnet at points far distant from it in Europe and Asia. The

westerly march of the declination needle, which lasted in England up to 1818,
and the ea'^terly movement which has since replaced it, are connected with a
supposed easterly motion of the Siberian focus, which, it is added, ' there is some

reason to believe .... has recently been reversed.' In opposition, therefore, to

the idea of the rotation of a magnetic focus round the geographical poles which the
earlier magneticians adopted, Stewart seems to have regarded the motion of the

Siberian focus as oscillatory.

   A very different aspect is put upon the matter by a comparison of the magnetic

maps of the world prepared by Sabine and Creak for the epochs 1840 and ISbO
respectively. Captain Creak, having undertaken to report on the magnetic
observation-1 made during the voyage of the 'Challenger,' supplemented them with

the unrivalled wealth of recorded facts at the disposal of the Hydrographic Depart-

trace the general course of the secular changes all over the world for forty years.

The negative results may be shortly stated. There is no evidence of any motion

either of magnetic pole or focus. The positive conclusions are still more curious.

There are certain lines on the surface of the earth towards which in the interval

under consideration the north pole of the needle was attracted. From each sidft
the compass veered or backed towards them. Above them the north pole of dip

needle moved steadily down.

     There are other lines from which, as tested by compa.'ss and dip circle, a north
pole was in like manner repelled. The two principal points of increasing attrac-

tion are in China and near Cape Horn ; the chief points of growing repulsion are
in the North of Canada and the Gulf of Guinea.

    I am sure that my friend Captain Creak would be the first to urge that we

should not generalise too hastily from this mode of presenting the facts, but there

can be no doubt that they cannot be explained by any simple theory of a rotating or

oscillating pair of poles. Prima facie they suggest that the secular change is due
not so much to changes at the principal magnetic points, as to the waxing and

waning of the forces apparently exerted by secondary lines or points of attraction

or repulsion.

  -- --All down the west coast ol America, close be it noted to one of the great

lines of volcanic activity, north hemisphere magnetism has since 1840 been grow-

ing in relative importance. Near Cape Horn a weak embryonic pole is developing

of the same kind as the well-known pole at the other end of the continent near

Hudson's Bay. Along a line which joins Newfoundland to the Cape of Good

Hope, precisely the   reverse  effects  have  been  experienced                                                         while  in  the  Gulf  of

Guinea a south hemisphere pole is growing within the tropics. Of course I do not

suggest that these secondary systems can ever determine the principal phenomena

of terrestrial magnetism, or reverse the magnetic states of the hemispheres in

which they occur. These are no doubt fixed by the rotation of the eartti. I do,

however, wish to emphasise the fact that they show that either secular change

is due to the conjoint action of local causes, or that if some single agent such as

a current system within the earth, or a change of magnetic conditions outside it,

be the primary cause, the eflects of this cause are modified and complicated by

local peculiarities.

     Mr. Henry Wilde has succeeded iu representing with approximate accuracy
the secular change at many points on the surface of the earth by placing two

systems of currents within a globe, and imparting to the axis of one of them a

motion of rotation about the polar axis of the earth. Eut he has had to supplement

uhis comparatively simple arrangement by local features. He has coated the seas

witli thin sheet iron. The ratio between the two currents which serves to depict

the secular change near the meridian of Greenwich fails in the West Indies. Thus

this ingenious attempt to imitate the secular change by a simple rotation of the

magnetic pole supports the view that local peculiarities play a powerful part in

modifying the action of a simple first cause, if such exist. I need hardly say that

I think the proper attitude of mind on this difficult subject is that of suspended

judgment ; but there is no doubt that recent investigation has, at all events, definitely

raised the question how far secular change is either due to or modified by special

magnetic features of diflerent parts of the earth.

    It is possible that light may be thrown upon this point by observations on a
smaller scale. Assuming for the moment that the difference in the secular changes

on opposite sides of the Atlantic is due to a dift'erence of local causes, it is conceiv-

able that similar causes, though less powerful and acting through smaller ranges,
might produce similar though less obvious difierences between places only a few

miles apart. For testing this Greenwich and Kew are in many respects most

favourably situated. Nowhere else are two first-class observatories so near to-
gether. Differences in the methods of publishing the results have made it somewhat
ditlicultto compare them, but the late Mr. Whipple furnished me with figures for
several years which made comparison easy. Without entering into details it may

be sufScient to say that the declination needles at the two places do not from year

to year run parallel courses. Between 1880-82 Kew outstripped its rival, between

1885 and 1889 it lost, so that the gain was rather more than compensated. The

difference of the declination of the two places appears to increase and diminish

through a range of five minutes of arc.

    This evidence can be supplemented by other equally significant examples. No

fact connected with terrestrial mao^netisni is more certaiu than that at present

the rate of secular change of declination in this part of Europe increases as

we go north. This is shown hj a comparison of our survey with those of our pre-

decessors fifty and thirty years ag(j, by M. Moureaux's results in France, and by

Captain Creak's collation of previous observations. Yet, in spite of this, Stonyhurst,

which is some i^OO miles north of C4reenwich and Kew, and should therefore outrun

them, sometimes lags behind and then makes up for lost time by prodigious bounds.

Between 1882 and 1886 the total secular change of declination at Stonyhurst was

about 3'o less than that at Greenwich and Kew, whereas in the two years 1890-92

it reached at Stonyhurst the enormous amount of 28', just doubling the correspond-

ing alteration registered in the same time at Kew. If these fluctuations are caused

by the instruments or methods of reduction, my argument in favour of frequent

comparisons and uniform treatment would be much strengthened ; but, apart from

the inherent improbability of such large differences being due to the methods of ob-

servation, the probability of their physical reality is increased by the work of the

magnetic survey.

     The large number of observations at our disposal has enabled us to calculate the
secular change in a new way, by taking the means of observations made about five

years apart at numerous though not identical stations scattered over districts about

150 miles square. The result thus obtained should be free from mere local varia-

tions, but as calculated for the south-east of England for the five j'ears 1866-91 it

differs by nearly 5' from the change actually observed at Kew.

   We have also determined the secular change at twenty-five stations by double

sets of observations made as nearly as possible on the same spot at intervals of

several years. The results must be interpreted with caution. In districts such as

Scotland, where strong local disturbances are frequent, a change of a few yards in

the position of the observer might introduce errors far larger than the fluctuations

of secular change. But when all such cases are eliminated, when all allowance is

made for the possible inaccuracy of field observations, there are outstanding varia-

tions which can hardly be due to anything but a real difference in the rate of

change of the magnetic elements.

   A single example will suflice. St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells are about

thirty miles apart. Both are situated on the Hastings Sand formation, and on good

non-magnetic observing ground. At them, as at the stations immediately around

--them Lewes, Eastbourne, Appledore, Etchingham, Ileathfield, and Maidstone

the local disturbing forces are very small. All these places lie within a district

about forty miles square, at no point of which has the magnet been found to deviate

by 5' from the true magnetic meridian. No region could be more favourably

situated for the determination of the secular change, yet according to our observa-

tions the alteration in the declination at St. Leonards in .six years was practi-

cally equal to that at Tunbridge Wells in five. It is difficult to assign so great a

variation to an accumulation of errors, and this is only one amongst several

instances of the same kind which might be quoted.

AVe find, then, when we consider the earth as a whole, grave reason to question

the old idea of a secular change caused by a magnetic pole or focus pursuing an

orderly orbit around the geographical axis of the earth, or oscillating in some

regular period in its neighbourhood. It would, of course, be absurd to admit the

possibility of change in the tropics and to deny that possibility in the arctic

circle, but the new facts lead us to look upon the earth not as magnetically inert,

-- --but as itself at the equator as well as at the pole producing or profoundly modify-

ing the influences which give rise to secular change. And then, when we push our

inquiry further, accumulating experience tells the same tale. The earth seems as it

were alive with magnetic forces, be they due to electric currents or to variations in

Wethe state of magnetised matter.  need not now consider the sudden jerks which

disturb the diurnal sweep of the magnet, which are simultaneous at places far apart,
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  551

and probably originate in causes outside our globe. But the slower secular change,
of which the small part that has been observed has taken centuries to accomplish,
is apparently also interfered with by some slower agency the action of which is
contined within narrow limits of space. Between Kew, Greenwich, and Stonyhurst,
between St. Leonards and Tunbridge Wells, and I may add between Mablethorpe and
Lincoln, Euniskillen and Sligo, Oharleville and Bantry, the measured diflerences
of secular variation are so large as to suggest that we are dealing not with an

unruffled tide of change, which, unaltered by its passage over continent or ocean,
sweeps slowly round the earth, but with a current fed by local springs or impeded
by local obstacles, furrowed on the surface by billows and eddies, from which the

luagnetician, if he will but study them, may learn much as to the position and

meaning of the deeps and the shallows below. But if this is the view which the

--facts I have quoted suggest, much remains to be done before it can be finally

accepted ; and in the first place to come back to the point from which I started

we want, for some years at all events, a systematic and repeated comparison of

the standard instruments in use at the different observatories. That they are not
in accord is certain ; whether the relations between them are constant or variable
is doubtful. If constant, the suggestions I have outlined are probably correct ; if

variable, then the whole or part of the apparent fluctuations of secular change may

be nothing more than the irregular shiftings of inconstant standards.
      I cannot myself believe that this is the true explanation ; but in any case it is

important that the doubt should be set at rest, and that if the apparent fluctua-

tions of secular change are not merely instrumental, the inquiry as to their cause

should be undertaken in good earnest.

     The question is interesting from another point of view. Tt is now fully estab-

lished that even where the surface soil is non-magnetic, and even where geolofiists

have every reason to believe that it lies upon non-magnetic strata of great thick-
ness, there are clearly-defined lines and centres towards which the north-seeking
 pole of a magnet is attracted, or from which it is repelled. To the magnetic
surveyor fluctuations in secular change would appear as variations in the positions

 of these lines, or as changes in the i'orces in play in their neighbourhood.

     Greenwich and Kew are both under the influence of a widespread local disturb-

ance which culminates near Reading. At both places the needle is deviated to the

west of the normal magnetic meridian, and if the westerly declination diminishes

sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly at one observatory than at the other,
this must be, or, at all events, would in the first instance appear to be, due to
 local changes in the regional disturbing forces. The questions of the nature of the

 irregularities of secular change and of the causes of local disturbances are therefore

intermingled and information gained on these points may in turn be useful in
                                                                            ;

solving the more diflicult problem of world-wide secular variations.

   --Two causes of regional and local disturbances have been suggested viz., earth

currents, and the presence of visible or concealed magnetic rocks. The two
 theories are not mutually exclusive. Both causes of the observed effects may, and

probably do, coexist. I have, however, elsewhere explained my reasons for believ-

 ing that the presence of magnetic matter, magnetised by induction in the earth's

 field, is the principal cause of the existence of the magnetic ridge-lines and foci of

attraction which for so many years we have been carefully tracing. I will only
 now mention what appears to me to be the final and conclusive argument, which,

 since it was first enunciated, has been strengthened by the results of our more
 recent work. "We find that every great mass of basic rock, by which the needle

 is affected at considerable distances, attracts the north-seeking pole. Captain

 Creak some years ago showed that the same statement is true of those islands in
 the northern hemisphere which disturb the lines of equal declination, while islands

 in the southern hemisphere repel the north pole and attract the south. In other

 words, these disturbances are immediately explained if we suppose that they are
due to magnetic matter magnetised by induction. The theory of earth currents

 would, on the other hand, require that round the masses of visible basalt, and

 round the island investigated by Captain Creak, currents, or eddies in currents,

 should circulate in directions which are always the same in the same hemisphere,
652 REPORT-- 1894.

and always opposed on opposite sides of tlie equator. For this supposition no
satisfactory explanation is forthcoming, and therefore, with all reserves and a full
consciousness that in sucli matters hypothesis ditiers but little from speculation, it

appears to me that the theory that induced magnetism is the main cause of the

disturbance has the greater weight of evidence in its favour.
     If this be granted, it is evident that the positions of the main lines and centres

of attraction would be approximately constant, and, so far as it is possible to form
an opinion, these conditions seem to be satistied. There has certainly been no
noticeable change in the chief loci of attraction in the five years which have
elapsed between the epochs of our two surveys. Mr. Welsh's observations made in
Scotland in 1857-8 fit in well with our own. Such evidence is not, however, in-
consistent with minor changes, and it is certain that, as the directions and magnitude
of the inducing forces alter, the disturbing induced forces must alter also. But
this change would be slow, and as the horizontal force is in these latitudes com-
paratively weak, the change in the disturbing forces would also be small, unless
the vertical force altered greatly. It is, at all events, impossible to attribute to
this cause oscillations which occupy at most eight or ten years. It is possible to

--suggest other changes in the state of the concealed magnetic matter alterations
--of pressure, temperature, and the like to which the oscillations of secular change

 might be due, but probably there will be a general consensus of opinion that if the
 slowly changing terms in the disturbance function are due to magnetic matter,
 the more rapid fluctuations of a few years' period are more likely to be connected
 with earth currents. It becomes, therelore, a matter of interest to disentangle
the two constituents of local disturbances; and there is one question to which I
 think an answer might be obtained without a greater expenditure than the impor-
 tance of the investigation warrants. Are the local variations in secular change
waves which move from place to place, or are the}' stationary fluctuations, each
of which is confined to a limited area beyond which it never travels F Thus, if
 the annual decrease in the declination is at one time more rapid at Greenwich than

at Kew, and five years afterwards more rapid at Kew than at Greenwich, has the

 maximum of rapidity passed in the interval through all intervening places, or has
 there been a dividing line of no change which has .separated two districts which

 have perhaps been the scenes of independent variations." The answer to this
 question is, I take it, outside the range of our knowledge now; but if the declina-
 tion could be determined several times annually at each of a limited number of
 stations in the neighbourhood of London, to this inquiry, at all events, a definite
 answer would soon be furnished.

      There are two other lines of investigation which, I hope, will be taken up sooner
 or later, for one of which it is doubtful whether the United Kingdom is the best

 site, while the other is of uncertain issue.
      If, however, it be granted that the principal cause of local and regional magnetic

 disturbances is the magnetisation by the earth's field of magnetic matter concealed
 below its surface, the question as to the nature of this mateiial still remains to be
 solved. Is it virgin iron or pure magnetite, or is it merely a magnetic rock of
 the same nature and properties as the basalts which are found in Skye and Mull ?

 There is, of course, no d, priori reason why all these different materials should not

 be active, some in one place and some in another.

     As regards the United Kingdom, I have, both in a paper on the Permeability
 of Magnetic Rocks and in the description of the recent survey, made calculations
 which tend to prove that, if we suppose that the temperature of the interior of the

 eartii is, at a depth of twelve mUes, such as to deprive matter of its magnetic proper-

ties, and if we further make the unfavourable assumption that down to that limit

 the susceptibilit}' is constant, the forces which are observed on the surface are of
 the same order of magnitude as those which could be produced by large masses
 of ordinary basalt or gabbro. It would not, however, be wise to generalise this
 result, and to assume that in all places regional disturbances are due to basic rocks

 alone.

    We know that local efl'ects are produced by iron ore, for the Swedish miners

seek for iron with the aid of the magnet, and in some other cases magnetic disturbs
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                            553

ances of considerable range are so intense as to suggest that material of very higli

magnetic permeability must be present.

     If the concealed magnetic matter were iron, and if it were present in large
quantity, it is evident that the results of experiments with the magnetometer and
dip circle might be supplemented by observations made with the plumb-line or
pendulum. In such a case the region of magnetic disturbance would also be a

region of abnormal gravitational attraction. An account of a suggested connection

between anomalies of these two kinds occurring in the same district has lately been

published by Dr. Fritsche.'

Observations made about thirty years ago by a former director of the Astro-

nomical Observatory in Moscow led to the conclusion that throughout two large

districts to the north and south of that city the plumb-line is deviated in opposite

directions. The deflections from the vertical are very considerable, and indicate

a relative defect in the attraction exerted by the rocks in the neighbourhood of

Mo.-cow itself, and the suggestion has been made that there is either a huge cavity

-- --a bubble in the earth-crust a little to the south of the town, or that the matter

at that point is less dense than that which underlies the surface strata on either

side at a distance of ten or twelve miles.

As long ago as 1853, Captain Meyen made magnetic obeervations in order to

determine whether the same district is also the seat of any magnetic irregularity.

His stations were hardly sufficiently numerous to lead to decisive results, but the

magnetic elements have recently been measured by Dr. Fritsche at thirty-one place's

within fifty miles of Moscow. The experiments were all made within eleven

days, so that no correction for secular change is required. They indicate a locus

of magnetic attraction running through Moscow itself. South of the town the

disturbance again changes in direction so as to show either that repulsive forces

are in play, or that there is another magnetic ridge line still further to the south.

Dr. Fritsche thinks that these observations explain the gravitational anomalies

without recourse to the somewhat forced hypothesis of a vast subterranean cave,

lie assumes that there is a concealed mass of iron, which approaches near to the

surface at Moscow, and also along two loci to the south and north of the city. He

attributes the magnetic irregularities to the attraction of the central iron hill, the

deflections of the plumb-line to the flanking masses. It is perhaps not inconceiv-

able that such results might follow in a special case, but without the support of

calculation it certainly appears that the magnetic experiments point to the

existence of the principal attracting mass under the town. This is in fact the

arrangement shown in the figure with which Dr. Fritsche illustrates his hypothesis.

If this is so, the theory would 'primd facie seem to require that the bob of a plumb-

--line should be .attracted towards and not as is in some places actually the case-

away from the centre of the magnetic disturbance. On the whole, then, though

the coexistence of large magnetic and gravitational disturbances in the same place

is suggestive, I do not think that they have as yet been proved to be different

effects of the same hidden mass of magnetic matter.

In a few weeks an International Geodetic Conference will meet at Innsbruck,

at Aviiich the Royal Society will be represented. It is, I believe, intended to

extend the detailed investigation of the relations between the nature of the earth's

Wecrust and the gravitational and magnetic forces to which it gives rise.  may

therefore hope that special attention will before long be given to localities where

both may combine to give information as to facts outside the range of the ordinary

methods of geology.

The second phenomenon on which more light is desirable, is the permanent

magnetisation of magnetic rocks. It is known that fragments of these are

strongly but irregularly magnetised, but that the effect of very large 'masses at a

distance appears to be due to induced rather than to permanent magnetism.

There are three questions to which I should like an answer. Are underground

masses of magnetite ever permanently magnetised ? Are large areas of surface
masses, saj' a few hundred square yards in extent, ever permanently and approxi-
mately uniformly magnetised in the same sense ? Is there any relation between
the geological age and the direction of the permanent magnetism of magnetic

rocks ?

Inquiries such as these can only be taken up by individual workers, but I ven-

ture to think that the comparison of the observatory instruments and the fluctua-

tions of secular change outside the observatories could best be investigated under
the auspices of a great scientific society. The co-operation of the authorities of

the observatories will no doubt be secured, but it is most important that the
comparisons should in all cases be made with one set of instruments, and by the
same methods. Whether the British Association, which for so long managed a

magnetic observatory, maj' think that it could usefully inaugurate the work, it

Whowould be improper for me in a presidential address to forecast.  does it is

of less importance than that it should be done, and I cannot but hope that the

arguments and instances which I have to-day adduced may help to bring about

not only the doing of the work, but the doing of it quickly.

1. Preliminary Experiments to find if Subtraction of Water from Air
    Electrifies it. By Lord Kelvin, P.R.S., Magnus Maclean, M.A.,

     F.RS.E., and Alexander Galt, B.Sc, F.R.S.E.

Experiments with this object were commenced by one of us in December 1868,

but before any decisive result had been obtained, circumstances rendered a post-

ponement of the investigation necessary.

   A glass u-tube with vertical branches, each 18 in. long and about 1 in. bore,

with the upper eight inches of one of the branches carefully coated outside and

inside with clean shellac varnish, was held fixed by an uninsulated support at-

tached to the upper end of this branch. The other branch was filled with little

fragments of pumice soaked in strong pure sulphuric acid or in pure water ; and a

fine platinum wire, with one end touching the pumice, connected it to the insu-

Alated electrode of a quadrant electrometer.  metal cylinder, large enough to

surround both brandies of the (j-tube without touching either, was placed so as

to guard the tube from electric influences of surrounding bodies (of which the

most disturbing is liable to be the woollen cloth sleeves of the experimenters or

observers moving in the neighbourhood). This metal tube was kept in metallic

connection with the outside metal case of the quadrant electrometer. The length

of the exposed platinum wire between the u-tube and the electrometer was so

short that it did not need a metal screen to guard it against irregular influences.

An india-rubber tube (metal, metallically connected with the guard cylinder,

would have been better) from an ordinary blowpipe bellows was connected to

the uninsulated end of the y-tube. Air was blown through it steadily for nearly

an hour. With the sulphuric pumice in the other branch the electrometer rose in

the course of three-quarters of an hour to about nine volts positive. When the

pumice was moistened with water, instead of sulphuric acid, no such effect was

observed. The result of the first experiment proves decisively that the passage of

the air through the jj-tube gave positive electricity to the sulphuric acid, and there-

Afore sent away the dried air with negative electricity.  corresponding experiment

with fragments of chloride of calcium instead of sulphuric pumice gave a similar

result. In repetition of the experiments, however, it has been noticed that the

strong positive electrification of the (j-tube seemed to commence somewhat sud-

denly when a gurgling sound, due to the bubbling of air through free liquid,

in the insulated ij-tute, and with an uninsulated (j-tube filled with sulphuric

pumice between the bellows and the insulated tube, so that the air entering it ia

artificially dried. With this arrangement the insulated y-tube was negatively

electrified by the blowing of the air through it ; but this electrification may have

been due to the negative electrification of the dry entering air to be expected from

2. Preliminary Experiments for comparing the Discharge of a Leyden Jar

     through different Branches of a Divided Channel. By Lord Kelvin,

     P.B.S., and Alex. Galt, B.Sc, F.R.S.E.

     In these experiments the metallic part of the discharge channel was divided
between two lines of conducting metal, each consisting in part of a test-wire, the
other parts of the two lines being wires of different shape, material, and neighbour-
hood, of which the qualities in respect to facility of discharge through them are to

be compared.

     The two test-wires were, as nearly as we have been hitherto able to get them,
equal and similar, and similarly mounted. Each test-wire was 51 cm. of platinum
wire of "006 cm. diameter and 12 ohms resistance, stretched straight between two metal
terminals at the ends of a glass tube. One end of the platinum wire was soldered
to a stiff solid brass mounting ; the other was fixed to a fine spring carrying a light
arm for multiplying the motion. The testing effect was the heat developed in the
test-wire by the discharge, as shown by its elongation, the amount of which was

judged from a curve traced, by the end of the multiplying arm, on sooted paper

carried by a moving cylinder. Two of Lord Kelvin's vertical electrostatic volt-

meters, suitable respectively for voltages of about 10,000 and 1,500, were kept
constantly with their cases connected with the outer coatings of the leyden, and

their insulated plates with the inside coatings of the leyden.

     I. In the experiments hitherto made the two wires to be tested have generally

been of the same length. When they were of the same material, but of different

diameters, the testing elongation showed, as was to be expected, that the test-wire
in the branch containing the thicker wire was more heated than the test-wire in
the other branch. In a continuation of the experiments we hope to compare
hollow and tubular wires of the same external diameter, and same length and same

material.

   --II. With wires of different non-magnetic material for example, copper and
--platinoid of the same length, but of very different diameters, so as to have the

same resistances, the testing elongations were very nearly equal.
      III. In one series of experiments the tested conductors were two bare copper

wires, each "16 cm. diameter, 9 metres long, and resistance "085 ohm, which, it will
be observed, is very small in comparison with the 12 ohms in each of the platinum
test- wires. One of the copper wires was coiled in a uniform helix of forty turns on
a glass tube of 7 cm. diameter. The length of the helix was 35 cm., and the distance
from centre to centre of neighbouring turns therefore f cm. The middle of the
other copper wire was hung by silk thread from the ceiling, and the two halves

passed down through the air to the points of junction in the circuit. The elonga-
tion of the test-wire in this channel was more than twice as much as that of the
test-wire in the channel, of which the helix was part.

     IV. One hundred and seventy-one varnished pieces of straight soft iron wire
were placed within the glass tube, which was as many as it could take. This made

the testing elongation ten times as great in the other channel.

    V. The last comparison which we have made has been between iron wire and
platinoid wire conductors. The length of each was 5025 cm. The diameter of
the iron wire was ·0.34 cm., and its resistance 6"83 ohms. The diameter of the
platinoid wire was "058 cm., and its resistance 6"82 ohms. Each of these wires was

supported by a silk thread from the ceiling, attached to its middle (as in III. and IV.

for one of the tested conductors). Fourteen experiments were made, seven with
the test-wires interchanged relatively to the branches in which they were placed
for the first seven. The following table shows the means of the results thus
obtained, with details regarding the electrostatic capacities of the leyden-jars and
the voltages concerned in the results.

     In each case four leyden-jars, connected to make virtually one of capacity -02742
microfarad, were charged up to 9,000 volts, and discharged through divided channel.

A Method ofDetermining all the Rational and Integral Algebraic Integrals
    of the Abelian System of Differential Fquations. By W. R. Westkopp

     Roberts, M.A.

     The method of treatment adopted in this paper, though pregnant with facts
calculated to throw light on the general theory of Abelian functions and integrals,

has been strictly confined to the determination of the forms of the algebraic
integrals which are rational and integral functions of the variables and arbitrary

constants which enter into them. Jacobi's method of treatment enables us to
determine many of the algebraic forms of the integrals of the differential svstem,
but none of them are rational or integral, and even in the case of elliptic integrals
the one rational algebraic integral which the differential equation possesses,
involving an arbitrary constant, is arrived at with some difficulty from the known
forms of the integral which are not integral functions of the variables. In the

case of hyper- elliptic integrals I am not aware that rational and integral forms
have yet been given. The result of the present paper enables us to write down for

any case the forms of the algebraic integrals which are all rational and integral.
      Again, being given one of these forms, all the remaining ones can be determined

by the application of an operator B.

     With regard to the method adopted in the paper, I first show how to find all

the conditions which must be satis6ed in order that a binary quantic of this

degree 2n may be a perfect square, and show that they may be all found from a

matrix which I call the square matrix for the functions of the degree 2n. ^ I have

not entered on any discussion of these curious conditions and their intimate
relationship, which are well worthy of examination, insomuch as their number is

the number of ways in which 4n-3 quantities may be taken 2n -- 2 together,

and are still equivalent to but n conditions.

        2. On a Graphical Transformer} By A. P. Trotter.

     This instrument is intended for the expeditious replotting of a curve with
transformed ordinates without calculation or scaling. It consists of a rectangular
frame and a curved template or cam, and is used in conjunction with a straight

ruler.

Let the scale of one system of ordinates be set off^ upwards along the edge of

one of the perpendiculars, and the scale of the other along the edge of the other

perpendicular, but downwards. Join the corresponding points on the scale by

straight lines. The envelope of this system of lines may be thus drn-wn, and to this

curve a cam is cut in thin wood or ebonite.

   TTo transform any ordinate, set the frame against a square, adjusting the edge

to the ordinate, and the zero to the zero of the scale. Set a needle at the extremity

of the  ordinate ;  bring a straight edge to touch       the needle and the cam                                                                                                               prick off'
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

a point at the intersection of the straight edge with the other edge of the frame.

This point determines the length of the new ordinate.

   An instrument provided with a logarithmic cam was exhibited. With this

instrument the product or quotient of two curves can be found by adding or sub-

tracting the logarithms of the ordinates ; or the logarithms of a series of observa-

tions can be plotted. Cams for other functions can be easily made ; but it must be

remembered that the action of the instrument is, as it were, arithmetical rather

than geometrical, for a cam is useful only with reference to its own scale.
     This instrument not only enables transformations of a definite and known

character to be made, but is equally applicable for transforming in an empirical

manner. The curve drawn by a recording -voltmeter or ammeter may thus be

replotted for estimation of area, or other graphical analysis, without any knowledge
of the law of the particular instrument. In other words, a correction can be

applied to a curve.

     The cams are easy to make, and even if carelessly cut cannot possibly give

rise to cumulative errors. It is convenient to use the upper edge of the ruler

instead of the edge which rolls on the cam. The curve must in this case be set
out with the ruler, and used with the same ruler, or one of the same width. The
rolling of a straight edge on a cam has been used in a photometer, invented by

Mr. W. H. Preece and the author,^ for the automatic calculation of the squares of

the displacements of a lamp.

3. On a Linkage for the Automatic Description of Regular Polygons.
                    By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.

Let any number of equal bars be jointed together in the manner of a lazytongs,

so as to lie in two superposed planes, each bar in one plane (except the end bars)

being jointed at both ends, B, D, and at one intermediate point, C, to the correspond-

CDing points of three bars in the other plane ; but instead of the two distances BC,

CDbeing equal, as in the ordinary lazytongs, let them be unequal,  being the greater.

All the bars are to be precisely alike. They will form a frame with one degree of

freedom, resembling in this respect an ordinary lazytongs ; but instead of the three

series of points, Bj Bj . . . , Cj C, . . ., Dj D^ . . ., being ranged in three parallel

straight lines, they will be ranged in three concentric circular arcs, two of which,

namely, B, Bj . . . and Dj D., . . . , formed by the iuner and outer ends respec-

tively, will subtend the same angle at the common centre O. In place of thp

rhombuses of the ordinary lazytongs we shall have kites, and the axes of all the

kites will pass through O.

    When the frame, supposed to be at first pushed close in, is gradually opened out

so as to increase the widths and diminish the lengths of the kites, the curvatures will
increase in a double sense : the arcs formed by the inner and outer ends will in-

crease in length, and at the same time their radii will diminish. The common

angle which they subtend at the centre will accordingly increase very rapidly, and

may easily amount to 360° or more. When it is exactly 360°, the first and last

Bpoints will coincide, as will also the first and last points D. In this position the

Dpoints will be the corners of one regular polygon, the points C of another, and the

B Wepoints   have thus an automatic arrangement for constructing a
of a third.

regular polygon with any number of sides. Also, as the axes of successive kites are

--equally inclined to one another, we have the means of dividing an arbitrary angle

into any number of equal augle.s an end which can also be attained by employing

the principle that equal arcs in a circle subtend equal angles at a point on the cir-
cumference, or, still more conveniently, by making use of the fact thar, those bar.s

which correspond to parallel bars in an ordinary lazytongs are equally inclined each

to the next.
      Strictly speaking, the figures obtained are not polygons, but stars, which can be

converted into regular polygons by joining the ends of their rays. It frequently
happens that the curvature can be extended far beyond .S60°, giving a succession of
regular stars with a continually decreasing number of rays.

Let each of the bars above described be lengthened at its inner end, B, till a

Apoint is reached, such that the three distances, AB, AC, AD, are in geometrical
OAprogression. Then it can be shown that the radius

Aby the ends is constant, and equal to AC. Hence the common centre, 0, can be

found automatically by employing two additional bars of length AC, jointed

OAThese bars  may be called radius bars, the other bars, AD, being called lonff bars,

The proof is easily gathered from an inspection of the accompanying figure, in which

OA,, OA,, OAj, OA^ are radius bars, AjD, A^D long bars, and A,Cj, A3O, portions

of two other long bars whose remaining portions are indicated by dotted lines. The

figure contains two equal and similar jointed rhombuses, OCj, OC3, and three

similar kites, OB, DB, DO. Each of the bars Afi^, AgCj is cut in a fixed ratio at

Athe pohit of crossing, B, the ratio of the smaller part to the whole being OAj : J)
bence we can have Bjoints both at and D, as well as at 0, and the other corners

of the rhombuses, without hampering the motion.

    Two radius bars are in general sufficient to give the centre, but we may in

theory attach a radius bar at each point A, and joint their other ends together at

one point, 0, which will be the common centre. There are difficulties in the way
of realising this design in practice, except with a very limited range of movement ;

but by carefully selecting the best order of superposition of the bars, and by

thinning oft' the radius bars towards the end where they are all superposed, it has

been successfully carried out in two of the frames exhibited, each consisting of ten
long bars and ten radius bars. The other frame exhibited illustrates the fir.-t
paragraph of this abstract, and consists of ten bars BD. The number of bars

in this frame might be increased indefinitely.
      If wi denote the ratio of a long bar to a radius bar, or of the longer to the

shorter sides of a kite, 2 a the angle between the two shorter sides, and 2 /S the
ano-le between the two longer sides of a kite, then, by considering one of the two

triangles into which a kite is divided by its axis, we have sin a/'sin /3 = m, which

is equivalent to

                       tan i (a -/3)/tan i(at^) = {m- l)/{m + 1).

as to give a three-rayed star.

     Professor Mittag-Leffler called attention to the intimate relation which exists
between the modern theories of ordinary non-linear differential equations and the

addition theorem. He explained how the theories created by Fuchs, Poincart?, and
Picard may be generalised by making use of the considerations introduced by
Weierstras.<<, and showed the direction which this generalisation must take. He
also pointed out that the addition theorem itself may be generalised to a very con-

siderable extent, and that the resulting theory has important applications to the
theory of differential equations.

5. Ifote on a General Theorem in Dynamics. By Sir Robert Ball, F.R.S.

     The following general theorem establishes a relation which characterises the
particular type of screw-chain homography which is of importance in dynamics.

     Let a, ^, y, &c., be a series of screw-chains about which a mechanical system
of any kind with any degree of freedom can twist.

     Let T] be the impulsive screw-chain which, if the system were at rest, would
make the system commence to move by twisting about a.

     Let ^ be the corresponding screw-chain related to /3, and f to y, &c.
     Then the two systems of screw-chains, a, j3, y, &c., and r), ^, C, &c., are homo-

graphic.

     But this homography is not of the most general type. It was only lately that

I succeeded in ascertaining the further general condition that the screw-chains

must satisfy.
     Let =r,,f denote the virtual coefficient of the screw-chains a and ^ ; i.e., let this

symbol denote the rate at which work is done by the unit of twist velocity about
a against the unit wrench on ^.

     Then every three screws n, 0, y in one group are connected with their three
correspondents r], ^, ( in the other group by the relation

   6. The Asymmetric ProbaUlity Curve. By F. Y. Edgeworth, M.A.

     The asymmetric probability curve is the general form of the law of error. It
may be obtained by solving a system of partial diHerential equations, which is tbe
generalisation of the system given by Mr. Morgan Crofton for the symmetrical
probability curve ('Encyclopedia Britaunica,' article on Probabilities, p. 781,

equations 45, 46). The generalised system may be written

curve which is indicated by Todhunter as being related to the ordinary probability
curve as a second is to a first approximation (Todhunter, 'History of Probabili-
ties;' Laplace, art. 1002, p. 568). This slightly asj'mmetrical probability curve

may be used to correct the theory of correlaiion investigated by Messrs. F. Galton

and H. Dickson ('Proc. Roy. Soc'.,' 1886), and by the present writer ('Phil. Mag.,'
November and December i8il2). Whereas, according to the first approximation,
the most probable y corresponding (or ' relative ') to any assigned (or 'subject')
value of X lies on a right line passing through the origin, according to the second
approximation the locus of correlates is a parabola.

     of the Regidar Bodies in n-Dimensional Sj^ace. By Prof. P. H.

       ScnoUTE.

1. The groups related to the regular bodies in ordinary space have been amply

studied by F. Klein in his · Vorlesungen iiber das Ikosaeder' (Leipzig, Teubner, 1884).

There in every case the order of tlie group has been found by enumeration of the

possible positions; so tbe remarkable fact that this order is always twice the

number of edges is not observed.
    I now wish to publish a simple general principle by means of which tbe order

of the group may be easily determined. This principle will prove to be capable of

immediate extension to 7)-(1imensioual space.

   NThese are numbers of form = 2''-l, where p is prime. Lucas has shown
Nthat is composite, and contains the factor (2^; + 1) when p and (2^ + 1) are both

prime, and jj is of form (4;; + 3).

NSuch numbers            may for shortness be called Lucasia^is. The hio-hest

Lucasians, determinable by the existing tables of primes (extending to 9 000 000)

are given by

     It seems probable that primes of one of forms p=(2^ + l), (2^ + 3) will, with
exception of those yielding Lucasians, generally yield prime vahies of N, and thp.t
no others will ; all the known (and conjectured) prime Mersenne's numbers fall

under this rule.

    17. .4 nev: Determination of the Ratio of the Specific Heats of certain

                    Gases. By O. Lummer a^id E. Pringsiieim.'
    When a perfect gas expands adiabatically from the pressure p^ to the pressure

p^, while its absohite temperature decreases from T, to T., we have

                                .- °^(£)

where T means the ratio of the two specific heats. Therefore T can he deter-
mined by four corresponding vahies oi p^, p.,,'S^, and T.^. For this purpose we

experimented in the following way.

    A copper balloon, nearly globular, containing about 90 litres was placed in a

bath of water whose temperature was maintained constant within 0°-01 C. and
could be measured by a thermometer. Let this temperature be Tj. The balloon
"was iilled with a gas, well dried and pure, which was compressed to the pressure

p^, measured by a manometer of sulphuric acid communicating with the balloon.
Then the gas was allowed to escape into the atuiospliere through an aperture of

the balloon. So it expanded to the atmospheric pressure />., given by the

barometer. In this way the quantities ^»,,^;^, and Tj can be found easily. The
only difficulty is to determine the temperature T., of the gas at the moment
when the expansion is finished and the pressure has attained the value ^^. For
this purpose we need a thermometer showing the variable temperature of the gas

instantaneously, that is, a thermometer of a negligible small mass.

   A thermometer of the required qualities was formed by a strip of platinum of

·an extremely small thickness, which is soldered at both ends to two copper wires
insulated from each other and introduced air-tight into the balloon. From these
the strip hangs down freely in the middle of the balloon. The strip of platinum
with its conducting wires formed one arm of a Wheatstone bridge, so that we were
able to measure its electrical resistance, and hence its temperature at every
moment. The strip was prepared by the method first used for wires by WoUaston, and

adopted for strips by Lummer and Kurlbaum. It was cut out of a platinum silver

plate composed of a platinum plate with the thickness 0'6/i and a silver plate (3^1.
thick. The middle part of the strip had a length of 10 cm. and a breadth of
about 0'2 mm., while the two ends were formed by conducting laps 1-5 cm. long

and about 4 mm. broad. The silver was removed by nitric acid only in the middle

narrow part, so that the resistance of the conducting laps perfectly disappeared in
comparison with that of the middle part. But also these conducting laps are thin
enough to take at a short distance from the ends the temperature of the surround-

iiif^ fjas, as is easily proved by calculation. In this wa}' tlie fail of temperature at

the ends of tlie strip is perfectly eliminated. The resistance of the strip amounted

to 87 ohms at the temperature of 17° C; the variations measured by us were

between 1 and 4 ohms.

In order to find the lowest temperature T., reached by the gas while expanding

we have only to measure the smallest value which the resistance of the strip takes

Weduring the expansion.           worked in the following way. First, when the

balloon is filled with compressed gas of the temperature T,, the Wheatstone bridge

is equilibrated so that no current is going through the galvanometer. This state

we call the first equilibrium. Then the galvanometer arm is opened and out of the

arm of the bridge op])()site to the strip a part of the resistance is taken away, so

Nowtliat the resistance of this arm now is lower than that of the strip.  the gas is

allowed to escape out of the balloon, the temperature of the gas is lowered, and the

resistance of the strip decreases and approaches that of the opposite arm. Imme-

diately after the end of the expansion, at the moment when the strip has the

.smallest resistance, we close the galvanometer circuit, and now the galvanometer

shows by its deflection if the resistance of the strip at this moment is higher or

lower than the resistance of the other arm. Only in the case when both resistances

are exactly equal does the galvanometer remain at rest. This state we call the

second equilibrium. This second equilibrium is always to be attained by a syste-

matic variation of the initial pressure of the gas, and when it occurs the galvano-

meter remains at rest for some seconds, sliowing that daring this time there is no

appreciable conduction of heat to the gas surrouudmg the platinum strip.

In this way four corresponding values o{p^,p.,, T,, and T,, are found.

A small error in these experiments is caused by the heat radiating from the

walls of the balloon to the strip cooled by the expanding gas, but it is possible to

determine the amount of this error by experiment. For this purpose we executed

the experiments described above, once with a simple platinum strip, the second

time with the same strip after having blackened it by platinum black. In the

second case the error due to radiation is increased in the same proportion, as the

absorbing power of blackened platinum is larger than that of the uncovered, and

therefore we found a smaller value of T than before. The relation of the two

absorbing powers was determined by special experiments, and so we found the

correction necessary to remove the error resulting from radiation.

The gases on which we worked were atmospheric air, oxygen, carbonic acid,

and hydrogen.

The results obtained with the naked strip were

To these values we must add the correction caused by radiation

Consequently we get the values of  + 00021

    That we found a much greater value for hydrogen than all former experimenters

is the best proof of the superiority of our method. All other methods failed with
hydrogen because the heat conduction of this gas is very great, and consequently
the experiments were not adiabatic. Our method gives also for hydrogen the
second equilibrium of the Wheatstone bridge lasting for more than a whole second,
showing that also here the expansion is quite adiabatic.

     Solutions ivhich freeze at Temperatxires just behno 0° C. JUj tlie Late

    P. B. Lewis. Communicated by Dr. Mejer AVildermann.

The tbermometers used for measuring minute variations in temperature were

f^radnafed, the one to read to thousandths the other to hundredths of a degree. The

total vohime of the solution used in the various determinations was J, 250 c.c. The

beaker containiu"- tlie liquid for examination was placed on a felt cushion, wrapped

in thin gutta-percha, inside a zinc vessel which acted as an air-chamber. The

cover of this vessel was provided with a circular opening into whicli litted a cork,

holding the thermometers. The stirring of the liquid was efi'ected by a porcelain

stirrer which consisted of two parallel porcelain plates, in which there were corre-

sponding holes for the thermometers to pass through, and besides these eight round

holes so arranged that the holes in the upper plate did not correspond with those

in the lower plate. On moving the stirrer up and down currents are sent' in all

directions. The thermometers are kept uniformly at a temperature of 0° C, even

when not in use, by keeping them plunged in a glass beaker, tilled with ice and

water at 0° C. This second beaker is contained in a similar zinc vessel, which acts

as a cold-air chamber. The two zinc vessels, the one containing the distilled water

and the other the solution to be examined, are placed in a larger zinc vessel, which

acts as an ice-bath, and which is encased in a yet larger zinc vessel, so that there

should be a cushion of air of some centimetres' thickness between the two. The

outermost zinc vessel stands on a thick felt mat, and is wrapped in a thick felt

cover. Ilie ice-bath was covered over as far as possible with pieces of asbestos

cloth. 13y these means a fairly constant temperature is maintained in the bath.

The temperature of the ice-bath should only vary between 1°'8 and -- 2° when the
It'mperature of the room is 12° to 18°, and onl}^ between -- 2°"1 and 2°-2 at a tem-

perature of 25°. It is necessary for a successful experiment to overcool the solu-

tion by about 0°-7 to 1°. Under these conditions the most accui-ate determination

of the freezing-point can be obtained : the mercury in the large thermometer has

suHicient time to become exactly of the temperature of the solution, the ice is obtained

in the form of thin films, and the freezing-point remains fairly constant for from

ten to fifteen minutes, though slight variations of from O°'O0Ol to 0°'0002 occur,

and in the more concentrated solutions of 0°0003. As regards the action of the
theriUo:ueters it is important to know how far the capacity of their bulbs is affected

by the pressm-e caused by a rise, especially a rapid rise, of mercury in the stem, and

how quickly the bulb recovers from the expansion or contraction which variations of

pressure or temperature cause. It can only be here stated that if such variations exist

they lie within the limits of ordinary experimental error, namely, 0°'0001, 0°'0002,

and I'ai-ely 0°-0003. On the other hand, it was found that when the more delicate

thermometer had been allowed to remain for several hours at the ordinary tem-

perature, a rise in its indication of the freezing-point could be observed for many

days afterwards, and a long-continued exposure to a rise or fall of atmospheric

pressure causes a variation of about 0°-000.3 in the reading of the freezing-point
Afor 1 mm. rise of the barometer.
                                   similar variation is produced in the reading of

the smaller thermometer. In the case of very dilute solutions only those determi-

nations of the freezing-point which have been made during almost constant condi-

tions of atmospheric pressure are to be depended on. While the column of mercury

is rising the stirring must be maintained together with a light tapping with the

fingers on the cork. The maximum is reached when further tapping causes no

rise of the mercurial column. AVhen this point has been reached readings are made

every minute for from eight to ten minutes. The readings are made with a small

lens. After the constant point has been observed for from eight to ten minutes the

form taken by the ice produced is examined. If the experiment has been success-

ful the ice will have formed in fine films and in considerable quantity throughout

the solution. Art account of this investigation will be given in the Journal of the

Chemical Society, and in the 'Zeitsch. f, physik. Chemie.'

     19. The Influence of Temperature upon the Specific Heat of Aniline}

                               By E. H. Griffiths, M.A.

      Tlie author drew attention to the fact that water is by no means an ideal

liquid for calorimetric purposes, its great capacity for heat rendering it unsuitable

for operations such as that known as ' the method of mixtures.' Again, we have

but little knowledge concerning the chunges caused in its speciBc heat by changes
in temperature, and its vapour pressure at low temperatures is sufficient to cause
a constant leakage of heat by the processes of evaporation.

       In all these respects aniline appears to be superior.

     The method adopted for determining the specific heat of aniline was an electrical
one, and the specific heat was ascertained over a range of from 15° to 52° C. The
heat developed by rapid stirring was balanced by heat lost by convection, conduc-
tion, &c., and the rate of rise at diff'erent temperatures, due to the electrical supply
only, was ascertained.

     The results are closely represented by the formula

                       s = 0-5156 + {t- 20) X -0004 + (C - 20)- x 000002.

     The values obtained by means of this equation do not in any case differ from
the experimental results by more than 1 in 2,000.

   %20. On some Photometric Measures of the Corona cf A^n'il 1893.
                                   Professor H. H. Turner, M.A.

     The present paper is merely a preliminary note on some measures of the photo-
metric intensity of the corona on photographs taken at Fundium by the British

expedition in April 1893.

     The measures (of density of deposit at various points on the plates) were
made at South Kensington by the kindness of Captain Abney, who lent me his
apparatus for the purpose. This apparatus has been described by him else-
where in detail; and here it is only necessary to remark that a beam of light is
divided by a plane glass plate, part being transmitted and part reflected. The
photograph is placed in one beam, and a ' rotating sector ' in the other. The
beams are then caused to illuminate two small screens placed side by side, and

the aperture of the rotating sector is varied until the illuminations are equal.

The aperture of the sector is then read, and the reading is a direct indication of
the density of the photograph at the particular point under examination. In this
note it is desired to call attention to one or two points Avhich the observations,
though as yet incomplete, have suggested.

      (1) I cannot help referring to the beauty and simplicity of the rotating sector.
The ease and accuracy of the observations are such as I was quite unprepared for

and it seems to me that the apparatus is indispensable to the astronomical
photographer. I look forward to making use of it in a large variety of ways.

     (2) The points examined up to the present have been distributed along four
radii respectively north, south, east, and west from the moon's centre. If the
density be tabulated according to distance from the moon's limb, the resulting

curves are very similar to ' error ' curves, with the maximum at the moon's limb,

and deviations from a smooth curve are very small.
     (3) The results for the four radii are very similar ; and the mean of the east

and west radii gives a curve almost identical with that for the mean of the north
and south radii (the means being taken to eliminate the distance between the
centres of sun and moon). The general form of the corona at ' maximum ' is in
accordance with this result, but I was not prepared for so close an accordance as

the figures show.
     (4) The density of the film has by no means reached uniformity at the edge

of the plate, even in the small scale photographs, which allow of measures up to
70' or 80' from the limb. It is possible that the light causing this deposit is not

true corona, but at the same time it seems probable that there may be a closer

correspondence between pliotographs, and the eye observations which claim a large
' extension ' of the corona, than has hitherto been supposed.

                          By Isaac Roberts, B.Sc, F.R.8.

      Seven photographs of spiral nebulae and four of elliptic nebuhe were exhibited
as lantern slides on a screen, and their forms and structures shown and described.

     The photographs were taken with a reflecting telescope of twenty inches
aperture and long exposures of the sensitised plates, and much additional know-
ledge concerning the objects was revealed by the photographs.

     The author claimed that the photographs proved the following statements:
      1st. That the existence of spiral nebulte is a physical reality.
      2nd. That the convolutions of the spirals proceed from, or else converge to, a
stellar or star-like centre, and are arranged symmetrically with reference to each
other and to the stellar centre.
     3rd. That the convolutions, or spirals, are without exception broken up into
stars and star-like condensations, which are involved in nebulous matter, denser ia
the lines of the convolutions and fainter between them.
     The cause of the vortical motions of the nebulae was suggested to be collisions
between bodies in space, or else shrinkage of the diffused mass, producing concen-

trated gravitational effects.

     The elliptic nebulae were shown to be constituted with a stellar centre sur-
rounded by dense nebulosity, outside which are alternate rings of nebulosity with
spaces between them having little if any nebulosity in them, each nebula, as a
whole, presenting the appearance of a stellar system now in course of evolution
from a nebula of gigantic dimensions.

    By taking periodically a series of photographs and compariug them with each
other the changes that may take place in the nebulae will, sooner or later, be made

manifest.

   A preliminary note was read on some experiments undertaken at the request of

Professor Riicker for the purpose of investigating whether the remarkably high
conductivity of thin soap-films found by Professors Reinold and Riicker was pro-
duced by the svirrounding gas.

     Experiments were also made to test whether the gas in which a film is formed
affected the fall in surface tension which takes place. In both cases it was found
that the gas was not the efficient cause of the phenomenon observed.

The molecular conductivity of solutions of acetic acid is abnormally low, and

in order to test whether the velocities of the ions were reduced in the same

proportion an experiment was made by a modification of Lodge's method,
Awhich I had already used for tracing the course of other ions.^

1. On the Hesults of a New Analytical Representation of the Distribution of
    Magnetic Force on the Surface of the Earth. By Ad. Schmidt, (f

       Gotlia.

     The author has obtained in the first place three series in terms of spherical

harmonics for the three quantities aX sin v, /3Y sin v, yZ, where X, Y, Z are the

three components of the earth's magnetic force, v is the colatitude, and a, (i, y are
three factors, nearly equal to unity, depending on the spheroidal shape of the

earth. By a method which he has previously explained in the ' Archiv des

·leutschen Seewarte,' 1893, he deduces from these series three others which give
the magnetic potential on the surface of the earth : (1) as far as depends on forces
inside the earth, (2) on forces outside the earth. The third series represents that
part of the magnetic forces which cannot be expressed in terms of a potential, but
must be due to electric currents traversing the earth's surface. The first series has
been calculated to fifty-two, the second and third to forty-three coefficients. The
result shows an appreciable fraction of the magnetic force to be due to outside effects,
and also gives currents traversing the earth's surface, amounting on an average to
about O'l ampere per square kilometre.

     The author points out that thorouglily reliable results can only be obtained
after our knowledge of magnetic forces has been extended to higher latitudes in

the southern hemisphere.

    2. A Suggested Explanation of the Secular Variation of Terrestrial
                    Jfagnetiam. Bij Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.

    It is a matter of great importance to ascertain whether we must consider inter-

planetary space to be a conductor of electricity or not. If there is an appreciable
conductivity the magnetic system of the earth will, owing to its rotation, induce
currents which will react on the earth iu a twofold manner. There will be, in
the first place, a mechanical etlect tending to increase the length of the day, and,
secondly, a magnetic effect tending to displace the mngnetic axis. It is the object
of this communication to give tlie results of some numerical calculations referring
to the magnitude and nature of these reactions.

     The problem is of interest apart from any applications to terrestrial magnetism,
(liven a magnetic sphere rotating in a conducting medium, what are the mechani-
cal and magnetic forces acthig on the sphere ia consequence of electric currents
induced in tlie medium?

     The mathematical solution is easily obtained from Lamb's equations for currents
induced in spherical conductors; and, without entering into any details of calcula-
tion, I here state the principal results for the case when the sphere is uniformly
magnetised about an axis not coinciding with the axis of rotation.

     If the medium is either perfectly conducting or perfectly non-conducting, there

will be no mechanical etfect tending to stop the rotation of the sphere ; but for all
finite conductivities there will be a couple opposing the rotation which is a maxi-

mum for a certain specific resistance of the medium.

     If the radius of the sphere is II, the angular velocity co, the specific resistance p

producing the maximum retardation is given by the relation

                                                     p -- 1'4 R-o),

where the numerical factor is approximate only.

    RFor the earth : = 6-4 x I0« ; w - 7-27 x 10-=

                                   p = 4-17 X 10".

     The resistance indicated by this number is such that if 4*17 volts were applied to
the two sides of a plate having a thickness of one centimetre there would be a cur-
rent of 10^* amperes per square centimetre. I do not know of any facts which
would make such a conductivity an impossible one, consistently with the extreme
tenuity of matter which we know must exist in space. The next point to consider
is the actual value of the maxioaum retarding couple. In C.G.S. units, and for a
sphere having the same size and magnetic moment of the earth, it is I'O x 10-*. If
this couple was to act continuously it would diminish the earth's rotational velo-
city to the extent of one second per day in 14,000 years. Early records of solar
eclipses show that the earth as a timekeeper has lost time, but authorities do not

agree as to how much. Two causes tending to alter the length of the day have

hitherto been considered, tidal friction tending to retard it and the contraction of

the earth tending to increase it. To this we must now add a possible retardation

due to the conductivity of the medium.

    The maximum magnetic couple calculated above is about six times that given

by George Darwin for the eflect of tidal friction, and it would by itself have pro-
duced a very marked effect in historical times, and according to Lord Kelvin

the effects of the earth's contraction are very small. It is, of course, very impro-

bable that the conductivity of space is just that required for the maximum effect.

If the conductivity is 100 times less, the couple produced would be equal to the

tenth part of the maximum couple, and such a couple would be impossible to

separate at present from the other effects, tending to alter the length of the day.
There is, therefore, a very large range of electric conductivity, within which that

of space may lie without an appreciable effect on the length of the day being pro-

duced in historical times.

    Turning our attention next to the magnetic reactions, we find that these will

displace the magnetic axis towards the geographical pole and round it from east to
west. If the earth behaved like a steel sphere, not subjected to any shocks or

changes of temperature, a certain displacement would take place once for all, but

no rotation such as is required to produce the secular variation. The constantly

renewed displacement of the magnetic axis, if it is due to the suggested cause,
Amust be produced by a continuous change inside the earth.
                                                            possible explanation

suggests itself in the secular cooling of the earth, owing to which more and moi"e

of its iron becomes susceptible to magnetisation. This virgin iron will be free to

adjust its magnetic axis to the magnetic forces acting on it, and a continuous dis-

placement of the axis must result. It must be acknowledged, however, that, even

taking account of this possibility, it is difficult to see how a rotation of the axis can

be kept up for several revolutions. Some light might be thrown on the question

by an experimental investigation to discover a possible effect of great pressure on

the temperature at which iron loses its magnetic properties. Whether there are

any appreciable magnetic eifects due to electric currents outside the earth may, of

course, be established by an analysis of the magnetic forces on the surface of the

earth. I understand that A. Schmidt and Neumayer have already made much

progress with such an analysis, and I am preparing an independent calculation with

special reference to the outside forces.

The results of this investigation may be stated tlius:

(1) The mechanical reactions on the earth of currents induced in space, assumed

to be a conductor of electricity by the rotation of its magnetic system, are insuf-

ficient to produce an appreciable lengthening of the day in historical times, unless

the conductivity lies within certain narrow limits. The absence of any marked

effect cannot therefore be brought forward as an argument against the conduc-

tivity of space.

(2) The magnetic reactions of the same current, taken in conjunction with the

secular cooling of masses of iron inside the eartli, tend to produce a displacement

which in kind is the same as that actually observed in the secular variation. But

whether quantitatively the variation can be explained in this way is very

·doubtful

           3. On the Construction of a Delicate Galvanometer.
                        By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.

     Maxwell has shown how a galvanometer must be wound in order to produce
the maximum magnetic field for a given resistance. The present communication

is intended to show what the advantage gained would be if the winding which is

theoretically best could be adopted. Assuming the cavity in which the magnet is

suspended to be cylindrical, the sensitiveness of the galvanometer will vary with

the square root of the resistance, and inversely as the square root of the radius of

the cavity. The smallest angle which can be read without making the system

astatic will also depend on the diameter of the mirror ; a point which has been

neglected in the construction of some recent galvanometers. Taking the resistance

of the galvanometer to be ono ohm, the diameter of the cylindrical cavity to be

one centimetre, and the widtii of the reflecting mirror to be also one centimetre,

--the smallest current which a galvanometer will show with a horizontal force of

0'17 is under different conditions as follows :

                                                            Amperes

If wound In the theoretically best possible way  . . . 160 x 10""

If wound on a bobbin of rectangular section of the best

dimensions, the wire being uniform in each layer, but

   changing from layer to layer so as to give the best results . 200 x 10^*
If wound on a bobbin of rectangular section with uniform

wire, the dimensions of the bobbin being the most favourable 2'14 x 10~*

    The advantage gained by having the winding in the way which is theoretically

ithe best is therefore not very marked.

7. On the Production of Beat-tones from Two Vibrating Bodies whose
    Frequencies are so High as to be separately Inaudible. By Alfred M.

     Mayer.

     In the first attempts to obtain such tones use was made of steel rods of
rectangular section, the lengths of whose sides are to one another as 4 : 5. These
rods were chamfered on one edge in the length of the rods, so that by striking.
a rod on this edge both component tones of the rod were obtained simultaneously

with the resultant tone, the latter being the lower second octave of the graver
tone of the rod. It was impossible to obtain beat-tones by this method by reason
of the short duration of the resultant when the frequencies of the two component
vibrations of the rod surpass the limit of audibility.

     Several bird-call whistles were made in order to obtain the proper proportions
to give frequencies surpassing the limit of audibility and j'et to give no hissing

sounds.

     The most efi'ective whistle has a diameter of air-disc of 5 mm., and the holes
in the opposed plates of the disc are 1'2 mm. in diameter. The distance of the
discs of the whistles is varied and adjusted by a micrometer-screw.

     With these whistles beat-tones have been obtained when the vibrations from

either whistle alone were inaudible.
      Beat-tones have also been obtained by Dr. Koenig and myself in Paris with

tuning-forks whose frequencies surpass the limit of audibility.

     Dr. Koenig anticipated me in the production of these beat-tones by several
months, and has actually used those beat-tones in tuning-forks whose frequencies

surpass the limit of hearing.

8. On the Variation of the Modidus of Elasticity with Change of Tempera-

     ture as determined by the Transverse Vibration of Bars at Various

    Temperatures. By Alfred M. Mayer.

     Lord Eayleigh in his ' Theory of Sound ' discusses the transverse vibration of
a bar free at both ends and supported under its two nodes, showing that we can
compute the frequency of the bar if we know the velocity of sound in the length
of the bar and the dimensions of the bar. The expression of these relations

the bar.

    To see how closely the formula gave the transverse frequency of bars, I had

rods of 1-5 m. in length, 2 cm. in width, and A cm. in thickness, and of uniform
section, made of cast steel, aluminium, brass, glass, and white pine. These rods
were vibrated longitudinally at 20° C. and their frequencies determined by

Koenig's tonometer, whence we obtained V. Out of each rod were cut three bars,
each about 20 cm. long, and these bars, also at 20° C, were vibrated trans-
versely. The mean departure of the computed from the observed numbers of

transverse vibrations was ^J^, the computed frequency being always in excess of
the observed except in the case of glass, where the computed was below the

observed frequency.

11. The Volume Charu/es which accomjjany Magnetisation in Nickel Tubes.

                           By Professor C. G. Knott, D.Sc.

     The method of experiment was similar to that employed in the determination
of corresponding changes in iron and steel tubes, and already described in a former
communication.^ Three nickel tubes, cut originally from the same solid bar, were
turned and bored. They were of the same length (47 cm.) and the same external

--diameters (4-2 cm.). The internal diameters were as follows: No. I., 2-543 cm.

No. II., 1-586 cm. ; and No. III., 0-692 cm.
     The decrease of volume in the tube of widest bore (No. I.), when subjected to

a longitudinal field of 600, was so large that it had to be measured with the naked
eye. The liquid meniscus in the capillary tube moved outwards through a distance
of 3 cm., which corresponded to a volume change of 2-4 cubic millimetres. This,
with a total internal volume of 224-47 cubic centimetres, gives a dilatation of

fully -10-^

     In the following table some of the more striking results are indicated. Under
each heading of field is a column containing the corresponding cubical dilatations

for the three tubes.

armature, and on to a circular scale. Varying currents -were sent round the field-

magnet coils, producing different values of induction in the armature.

     At a low induction the hysteresis is small and increases but slowly, the range
corresponding with the first part of the B/H curve, and the shape of the curve
being similar to that given by an alternating field. With increasing induction the
value of the hysteresis rises more rapidly, but does not continue to increase at a

Baniform rate. When = 12,000 the rate of increase of the hysteresis diminishes,
though the curve still rises rapidly. When B = 17,000 the curve begins to bend

over, reaching a maximum at 18,000 or 18,500, and rapidly falls when the induc-

Btion is further increased, until when = 21,000 the hysteresis is about one-third of

its maximum value. Higher inductions could not be satisfactorily reached with

the apparatus, but there was no indication of any diminution in the rate of decrease

of the hysteresis.
     Both soft charcoal iron and hard high carbon steel were tested, and found to

give the same results, the value in the steel reaching a maximum at an induction

of 16,000.

     These experiments show that there is no simple relation between hysteresis and
induction. The three stages of magnetic displacement each have a sharply defined
position on the hysteresis curve, the critical value occurring just on the knee of the
induction curve. The agreement of the results with the theoretical deduction
constitutes a strong verification of the molecular theory of magnetism.

     The above results hold good for all speeds up to seventy revolutions per second,

which was the highest speed obtained.

                            By L. R. WiLBERFORCE, M.A.

     The author pointed out that by comparing the two periods of vibration of a
body attached to a spiral spring of small angle the ratio of the torsional and
flexiiral rigidities of the wire or strip forming the spring could be found, and
hence, if the wire were homogeneous, isotropic, and of circular section, Poisson's

ratio for its material could be determined.

     Some experiments were shown illustrating the normal modes of vibration of
such a system, and the transference of energy from up-and-down to twisting vibra-
tions, and back again, which can be effected when the periods are nearly equal.

1. On Fuchsian Functions. By Professor Mittag-Leffler.

Professor Mittag-Lefller, after referring to a recent investigation by one of his

pupils, M. G. Oassel, spoke of the advantages and inconveniences connected with

the expression of automorphic functions by means of the Fuchsian or Kleinian

6 series. He showed how the theory of the 6 functions may be brought into

connection with that of the Abelian functions, and that an expression given by

M. Schottky for a certain ckss of automorphic functions is, in fact, applicable to
all these functions. He then referred to his own researches on the invariants of

linear differential equations, and pointed out that Giinther, in his paper in ' Crelle's

Journal,' has not fully realised the true nature of these researches.

      2. On Ronayne's Cubes. By Professor H. Hennessy, F.R.S.

     Some years since a box containing a pair of equal cubes was placed in the

author's hands, and he found that one of these could have its parts displaced so as
to leave a peculiarly shaped shell, through which the second cube passed without
any difficulty. Groups of twin crystals of a cubical form have been long known,
but their grouping could rarely admit of such a structure as the cubes referred to

present.

      It is manifest that a cube passed through another in the direction of the
diagonal of the square would leave two triangular prisms, but in order to connect

these prisms two flanges with interior sloping faces should be attached. The
thickness of these flanges in two directions, as well as the angle of inclination of
the sloping faces, are all connected by geometrical conditions which permit of the
solution of the problem of the construction of the shell of the first cube. The
author was unable to find the solution of the problem originally published by the
inventor of the cubes, Mr. J. Ronayue, some time about the middle of the last
century. Under these circumstances he completed the inquiry, and on comparing
the results with the measured dimensions of the prisms and flanges which con-
stitute the shell of the first cube he found the perfect concordance between the
calculated and measured dimensions. "When x represents the distance from a
corner of the cube to the edge of the flange, and a the side of the cube, then 6, the
inclination of the sloping face to the face of the cube, is found to be represented by

                sm 6 =         i   '--

                        3«5 + 4,z^-4a.iV2

The edge of each cube is 1'92 inch, and 6 is found both by measurement and by

the above formula to be 9° 45' nearly.

 3. On a Pro}oerty of the Catenary. By Professor H. Hennessy, F.R.S.

     In the course of inquiry into some hydraulic questions the author found that

the catenary of maximum area under a given perimeter may be inscribed in a

semicircle.^ Hence, if the radius of the semicircle is one foot, the chain hung
within it when in a vertical plane will be one yard. Thus the two fundamental

standards of English measure are connected with the catenary of maximum area.

4. A Complete Solution of the Problem, ' To find a Conic with respect to
    which two given Conies shall be Reciprocal Polars.' By J. W. Russell,

    M.A.

In the author's ' Elementary Treatise on Pure Geometry,' p. 147, a construc-

tion is given in the case in which the given conies intersect in distinct points.

This construction was extended to the cases of the conies touching or having three-

point contact. The method in the case of double contact was dirt'ereut. Taking

ABU to be the common pole and  the common chord, through U draw any line

X Ymeeting the conies in PP', QQ' respectively. Let         be the double points of

the volution PQ, P'Q' or of PQ', P'Q. Then the conic required is the conic

UA A Xtouching
      UBat and  at B, and passing through or Y. This method holds,

when suitably modified, in the case of four-point contact.

      5. The Impossibility of Trigraphic Fields of Spaces.

                       By J. W. RussELi, JI.A.

The simplest trigraphic form is that generated by three points P, P', V" on

three lines AB, A'B', A"B'', these points being connected by a relation of the

form

      ¥a^k' k' + a^k' k" + ... + ajc + ... =Og-i-

where rt,,fl, . . . are constants, and A; = AP/PB, A;' = A'P'/P'B, A;" = A"P"/P"B".

Starting from this form, various trigrapliic forms of increasing complexity can be
built up, as in the geometry of homographic figures. But it is impossible to

finally construct trigraphic figures on the analogy of homographic figures. To

A Cprove this, take B C D, A' B' D', A" B"'C" D" as corresponding tetra-

hedrons in the assumed trigraphic figures, and suppose that the variable points

P, P', P" of the figures subtend trigraphic pencils at the axes (BU, CA, AB),
(B'C, CA', A'B'), (_B"C", C"A", A"B'0 respectively. Then, if P and P' move
on straight lines, it is shown that P" moves on a surface, and not on a straight

line, as it should do.

6. On MaxivelVs Metliod of deriving the Equations of Hydrodynamics
 from the Kinetic Theory of Gases. By Professor Ludwig Boltzmann.

It is well known that the equations of hydrodynamics for a viscous fluid, as Max-

well was the first to show, can be derived from the hypothesis of the kinetic theory

of gases. But Maxwell's method is not quite satisfactory. Many terms of the

equations must be neglected in order to obtain the hydrodvnamical equations in

their usual form. Even if this course in most cases is justifiable, it cannot be

rigorously proved that such is the case, and the mathematician is not satisfied.

The following question arises, Is this a defect of the theory of gases, or is it

rather one of hydrodynamics ? Are these terms required by the theory of gases

not an essential correction of the equations of hydrodynamics? Will it not be

possible to find cases where these two theories are not in accord, and to decide by

experiments between them ? Maxwell himself raised this question, and he found

that the ordinary assumption, that in gases which conduct heat the pressure is

Aeverywhere equal in all directions, is only approximately true.  short time

before his death he published an ingenious method of treating these questions,

viz., the application of spherical harmonics to the theory of gases. Maxwell only

gave in a lew words the results of his calculations, in three short nott^s, which are

included in square brackets in his paper, 'On Stresses produced by Conduction of

Heat in Rarefied Gases.' These three notes show evidently that he must have

made a long and elaborate investigation on this subject a short time before his

death, which, however, has not been published. I have treated the same subject

by a different method, and have also found that many corrections of the equations

of hydrodynamics can be derived from the theory of gases. It will be not easy,

but perhaps not impossible, to test some of these differences by experiment. I have

not yet published these results, because they do not agree in all respects with the

results briefly announced by Maxwell, and the danger of falling into errors in this

subject is great.

With regard to this I beg the British Association to make efforts to ascertain

if the manuscript of the investigation made by Maxwell on the application of

spherical harmonics to the theory of gases is still in existence, and, if this manu-

script should be lost, to encourage physicists to repeat these calculations.

     10. On Experiments illustrating Clerk Maxwell's Theory of Light.
                        By Professor Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.

                       11. On an Electrical Theory of Vision.

                  Depaetment II.

12. On the Velocity of the Cathode Rays.
  By Professor J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.

13. On a Ten-canclle Lamp for use in Photometry.
      By A. Vernon Harcourt, M.A., F.R.S.

The author has in former years brought before this Section a burner consuming

a mixture of air with pentane vapour, and lamps consuming pentane vapour, which

gave a constant amount of light equal to that of an average standard candle.

    When so small a light is used in the ordinary photometry of coal-gas, errors

from defects in the adjustment of the photometer, or from slight haziness in the

atmosphere of the testing-place, are greater than when a light is used more nearly

Aof the same magnitude as that of the gas-flame which is measured.  light of

ten candles is well suited for the purpose. It has been shown that such a light

can be obtained from an argand gas-burner consuming air saturated with the

vapour of pentane ; and a gas-burner has been proposed for use which is well

suited for this purpose, except perhaps in being of a rather complex structure.

But to supply air saturated with pentane vapour at a steady pressure there is

needed a gas-holder of a few cubic feet capacity. The addition of such a gas-holder

to the apparatus makes it more costly and not easily portable. It has been shown

that great variations may occur in the proportions of pentane and air consumed by

the gas-burner without materially aSecting the light given out by the lower part

of the gas-flame. The admixture of air is, however, unnecessary, since at a

moderate temperature pentane can be volatilised without there being any necessity

for reducing the atmosplieric pressure by the admixture of another gas. The lamp

shown is on the same principle as the one-candle lamp devised by the author seven

years ago. The wick is raised or depressed by the ordinary rack-and-pinion

movement, the lower end of it dipping into pentane in the body of the lamp, while

the upper end is warmed by the heat conducted down from the flame. In the ten-

candle burner the wick fiUs the circidar interspace between the central and outer

tubes of an argand. The only difference between this and an ordinary lamp is

that the wick does not come near the flame, and needs no cutting or renewal ; nor

does the smoothness or roughness of its upper surface afl^ect the burning of the lamp.

The dimensions of the lamp and chimney upon which the air currents inside

and outside the flame depend have been determined by experiment so as to produce

a bright and steady flame. The entrance to the inner tube is throusrh a triangular

opening as in the usual construction of such lamps. It was found that the free

admission of air at this entrance caused an inequality in the flame, two peaks

appearing on either side of the place of admission of air. To steady and regulate

the admission of air at this point, a cylindrical case is fixed round the lower part

of the tube, into which air is admitted through a round hole 15 mm. in diameter.

The flame of a rich gas burning from a wide opening is of the colour of candle-

light even when an abundant supply of air is provided on both sides of the flame.

The light of a good gas-burner is less red, or more blue, than this ; and it is
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.      583

important for the photometry of coal-gas that the standard light employed should

be as nearly as possible of the same colour as the light of the gas-flame. The

light of the lamp has been brought to this colour by a small admission of air below

the point of combustion. Twelve holes, each .3 mm. in diameter, have been drilled
through the outer tube 15 mm. below the top. The draught of the chimney is

sufficient to determine an entry of air through these holes, which, happening under

Atixed conditions, is constant in amount.  short cylindrical screen goes round the

chimney, the bottom of which is 58 mm. above the surface of the burner ; and both

screen and chimney are surrounded by a pentagonal shade, four panels of which

are filled with blue glass, while the fifth, which is turned towards the disc of the

photometer, is filled half-way down with a metal plate, which, overlapping the

inner screen, allows only the light from the lower part of the flame to fall on the

disc of the photometer. By supporting the lamp at such a height that the bottom

of the screen is level with the centre of the disc, errors of parallax are avoided.

Mr, Sugg, I believe, observed, and Mr. Dibdin has proved, that with the flame of

an argand burner the light thus given by the lower part of the flame is independent,

within wide limits, of the total height of the flame. The observation is true, not

only for a particular burner, but for many, and probably for most, argand

burners. Many alterations have been made in the structure of this lamp, aud it

has generally been found, though not always with equal exactness, that the height

of the flame did not affect the light emitted from its lower part. As the lamp is
now arranged the height of the flame can be observed through the blue glass

panels, and whether the top is just visible above the circular screen or rises to the

top of the panel, the light which falls upon the disc of the photometer does not

--alter measurably. The adjustment of the light to the value of ten candles in

--other words, the adjustment of the height of the circular screen has been efl'ected

by a number of comparisons between the lamp and the one-candle pentane

standard.

1 i. On the Cause of the Spurious Double Lines sometimes seen with Spectro-
    scopes, and of the Slender Ajjpendages tvhich accompany them. By

     G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

      Spurious double lines are sometimes seen with the spectroscope. In order to
observe the phenomenon it is not necessary to use the complete spectroscope, noi
is monochromatic light essential. It is sufficient to look with the telescope of

the instrument directly down the collimator, so as to see the image of the slit.
If the instrument be now pointed towards, or nearly towards, a distant flame,
aud if the slit be narrowed down to a certain point, a spurious double line will be
seen in the observing telescope, instead of a correct image of the slit. The
phenomenon will be produced under the circumstances which most readily admit
of investigation when the incident light is restricted to a single beam of plane
waves, falling on the slit either normally or obliquely ; and incident light which
sufficiently approximates to being of this kind is easily provided by placing a
coarse supplementary slit in front of the lamp flame and allowing only the light
which passes through this slit to reach the collimator.

     Under these circumstances it will be found that when the light falls normally
on the slit of the spectroscope it will form an image in the observing telescope

which, with a certain width of slit, becomes a rather coarse double line bordered
on either side by an exceedingly fine hair-like appendage, which is visible only

when the light is sufficiently intense. By causing the incident light to fall
obliquely the two constituents of the double line may be made to thin down,
leaving a considerable dark interval between them, and then present verv much

the appearance of the sodium lines when fine. In intermediate positions of the
incident light the interval between the two constituents of the double line is
occupied by a bright ruling of hair-like appendages, varying in number with the
inclination of the incident light. The conditions of the experiment may be

--modified in other ways, and other appearances produced notably a flare con-

sisting of a ruling of bright lines fading out in one direction.

                                                                                 · KEPORT 1894.

All these appearances belong to the same class as the spurious disk of a star

with its attendant diffraction rings when viewed through a telesco^ie, and as the

images which very minute objects present when examined by the microscope. In

all these cases the image, as was long ago pointed out by Fraunhofer, is not a
reproduction of the object. In fact, when the object is so small or so remote

that the rays of light that reach the coUimating lens from different parts of it

differ only by a part of a wave-length or by a few wave-lengths, the diffraction

phenomena which are always present become of large size. These, in the cases

we have to deal with, fake the form of a direct beam of light spread out, with

coloured fringes extending like a fan to the right and left. If the telescope with

which the object is viewed can take in the whole of these we get a true de-

lineation of the object. But if it can only take in some of them, thtn the image

we see is not a representation of the object, but the image of another object, viz. of

that object which would emit the same central beam and those only of the fringes

which the instrument can grasp, but not any of the others. In all cases this apparent

object differs from the real object, and in some cases is wholly unlike it.

    If, for example, after removing the eye-piece, we look directly at the light

transmitted by the coUimating lens, and make the adjustments such that the in-

strument takes in only the central beam and the first diffraction spectrum on either

side, then on replacing the eye-piece we sliall see a double line instead of a coiTect

image of the slit. This, with some very thin appendages which can on'y be seen

when the light is sufficiently briglit, is, in fact, the kind of object which would emit

a central beam and a first diffraction spectrum, and these only, of those breadths,

in those phases, and with that ratio of the brightness of the central beam to

the first diffraction spectrum which prevail between those parts of the light as

actually received by the coUimating lens.

The image that presents itself might conceivably be calculated by dividing the

wave front as it passes the coUimating lens into pairs of strips, and integrating tl?e

illumination these produce on the focal plane. This is the method employed in

the case of tbe spurious disks of stars. Jiut even if this method were practicable

it would be inferior to a tentative geometrical treatment of the problem which,

though it does not furnish the exact result, is more instructive. The geometrical

method makes clear, which the integrations would not, why the thin appendage

lines present themselves in addition to tlie main double line.

     It was obviously desirable to attack the problem in its simplest form, which
occurs when the incident light reaches the slit of the collimator normally. It is

possible from general considerations, based on the theory of diffraction gratings,

to conclude that then the main part of tbe light of the image as seen must be con-

centrated into tico parallel strips constituting a so-called double line. The next

step is to assume a distribution of light in two such strips which would produce,

and which therefore would be the image formed by, a central beam and diffraction

spectra of which those of even orders, the 2nd, 4lh, &c., are of zero illumination.

This can be done in various ways, producing different distributions of the light

between the central beam and the spectra of odd orders. The next step is to
select among these one which gives nearly tbe same ratio of brightness of the first

spectrum to the central beam as prevails iu the light which actually reaches the

collimator from the slit. This was effected by making the strips broad, brighter

in the middle, and with an interval between them about one-seventh of their

width. The next step is to modify this distribution of light, so as to secure zero-

illumination in the third spectrum, while retaining the e.xtinction of the spectra of

even orders. This was efiected by removing one-eighth of the light from each of

the two strips                                                                   transferring half of  this eighth to a certain part of the other strip,
                                                                              ;

and with the other half forming an appendage line outside the strip, at a distance

from it of nearly half its width, and only one-seventh as broad. The distribution
of light, when modified in this way, on both the constituents of the double line
would present the appearance of a somewhat coarse double line, with a narrow

interval between them, and accompanied by two hair-like appendage lines, one to

the right and the other to the left of the main double line; and this resembles
the image as it actually presents itself in the telescope of the instrument.

   We thus see that part of the light must appear in the form of faint appendages

in order to reconcile the extinction of the third spectrum with the simultaneous dis-

appearance of the spectra of even orders. To get rid of the distant and fainter 5th,

7th, &c., spectra consistently with the other conditions of the problem in general

requires a further modification of the main lines, a modification of the appendages

already existing, and the introduction of other still fainter appendages. It should

he mentioned that it is possible to make the adjustments such that the appendage

lines, or some of them, shall overlie the main lines, and become merged in them, so

as not in the observations to be distinguishable from them.
     Having, by the geometrical treatment of some simple cases, made ourselves

acquainted with the general progress of events, it is best to study by obser-

vation what the details become with each of the innumerable distributions of light

that can be made to pass the coUimating lens, and to record the principal results;

for it would be an endless task to attempt the prediction of every phase of so

Protean a phenomenon. The observations are of a simple kind, since the image

which is formed in each case may be directly viewed in the telescope, and we can

also easily ascertain what has been the light that has produced this image, by

simply taking out the eye-piece and then looking down the tube of the telescope

Weand through its object-glass.      thus see the coUimating lens, and those parts

of the central band and diffraction fringes formed by the slit which have reached

the coUimating lens, so that these become known.

15. On the Luminosity observed tvhen a Vacuum Bulb is broken.
                              By John Burke.

It was noticed by Beccaria that a luminous effect was produced when vacuum

bulbs were broken in the dark. After making some experiments upon the subject

he attributed the luminous appearance, not to the breaking of the glass, but to the

dashing of the external air, on the inside, when it was broken. Professor J. J.

Thomson, in his work on ' Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism,' has

brought forward the phenomenon observed by Beccaria as likely to confirm

Mr. Crookes's theory of phosphorescence in a vacuum tube. The two phenomena,

however, that of phosphorescence in a vacuum tube and that produced by the

breaking of vacuum bulbs, seem to be totally distinct ; and the luminosity in the

latter case seems to be due to the collisions of the particles of glass with each

other. Beccaria also obtained a light when air was allowed to strike against

bodies placed inside a receiver, by the bursting of a bladder, but this was un-

doubtedly due to the burning portions of the bladder, that were stopped in their

descent by the articles within the receiver, which he appears not to have observed.

AThe following experiments tend to disprove Beccaria's theory.        number of

fragments of broken glass were supported at the mouth of the receiver of an air-

pump by an arrangement such that when air was allowed to rush into the

receiver by the removal of a thick glass plate which served to cover the opening

at the top, the pieces of glass were capable of descending with the air. The same

luminous effect was obtained as when vacuum bulbs were broken.

   A single spark was visible when only one piece of glass was employed, and

appeared as though it had been caused by the striking of this against the side of

the receiver. When no fragments of glass were employed no light was observed,

even when a number of articles were placed at the bottom of the receiver.

Air was made to issue forth, on the surface of various substances, and especially

on the sharp edges of broken glass, from bottles containing the air in a highly

compressed state, but without any luminous effect.

The same results were obtained with other gases besides air.

A light was obtained when two large pieces of glass were violently struck,

but no light was observed by the mere breaking of glass either in air or in a vacuum.

Other substances instead of glass were also employed, such as cast iron, steel,

copper, ebonite, sealing-wax, hone, but without any luminous effect.

All the experiments made seem to point to the conclusion that the phenomenon

is not due to the violent impact of the air on the glass but to the collisions of the

fragments of glass with each other.

     16. On the Correction of Optical Instruments for Individual Eyes.
                        By Tempest Anderson, M.D., B.Sc.

    The subject of astigmatism is now well understood, and the public are

beginning to recognise that a very large proportion of cases of defective sight
require a cylindrical as well as a spherical element in the corrective spectacles,

and can by this means obtain a much greater acuteness of vision than without it.
It is also well known that ordinary myopic or hypermetropic eyes, even if

presbyopic, can obtain perfect vision with a telescope or microscope by adjusting
the focus ; but it is quite dift'erent with astigmatic eyes, for as the image comes
into focus with one meridian of the eye, it goes out with the other.

     Persons with such eyes when ordered spectacles are often rather casually told
that they must wear their glasses when using a telescope or microscope, but there
the matter usually ends, for the spectacle glass is found to come against the eye-
piece, and even if it does not, the spectacle lens is not centred on the instrument,
and various ghosts and false images are formed, which cause the glasses to be

laid aside.

    Few eyes are altogether free from astigmatism probably half could have their
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

vision perceptibly improved by suitable cylindrical lenses ; and though the defect
is not sufficient to make it worth while to wear spectacles, it is greater than would
be allowed to exist in a telescope or microscope by a good maker. The defect is,
of course, more noticeable in the use of instruments which give a pencil of rays
which fully fills the pupil, such as the lower powers of telescopes and opera glasses
and hand-magnifiers.

     The remedy is simple, viz., to mount a cylindrical lens of power suitable
for the individual eye in a cap, which can be applied to the eye-piece of the
instrument. The lens can be properly centred, and causes no ghosts or false images,
and bemg close to the lens of the eye-piece takes up very little room, and allows the
eye to come convenienly near the instrument. Each observer will have one lens
to suit his own eyes, applied to his own instrument; but for the benefit of those

who like a complete instrument with adjustments to suit their friends, I may

point out that it is not necessary to correct the spherical error of the eye, as this
can be done by focussing, so that a set of caps containing, say, a dozen cylindrical
lenses of the ordinary powers would enable a telescope to be corrected for almost

any observer, provided he knew what cylinder he required.

How17. the Misuse of the Word ^ Force,' in Attractions, Electricity, and

    Magnetism, may he avoided tvithout much departure from existing
    practice. By Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney, F.R.S.

     All the classical writers on dynamics of the early part of the present century

--Laplace, Lagrange, Poisson, Gauss, and many others used the word Force in

F /two distinct senses, viz., for the 'Moving force,' and for the 'Accelerating
Aforce.'
              distinct improvement was introduced several years ago when the word

force was restricted to the former of these meanings, and when the ' accelerating

force' was named the acceleration, or, as it ought rather to be called, the

accelerator.

There is, however, one exception. In treatises on Attractions it is still usual

/to call the force of attraction. There seems no sufficient excuse for this ; and it
Weis therefore suggested that the word accelerator be used instead.
                                                                     may then

     Next ns regards Potential. This term is used in Dynamics, Electricity, and
Magnetism to designate physical quantities of different dimensions; but in all it
is that factor of energy which, in order to convert.it into energy, requires to be

multiplied

          In Dynamics, by a mass.
           In Electricity, bj' a quantity of electricity.
           In Magnetism, by a quantity of magnetism.

   --This may be stated conveniently by saying that

In Dynamics, Potential is the clynaonic energy-factor. In Electricity, Potential is
the electric energy-factor. In Magnetism, Potential is the magnetic energy -factor.

    Now a similar treatment of the term accelerator would at once carry out con-

sistency in our nomenclature, would point attention to the true relation between
these three sciences, and would free us from one part of the misuse of the word

force which is now prevalent. If this suggestion be adopted, we shall speak of

     The dynamic accelerator, viz., that force-factor which requires to be multiplied
         by mass to convert it into a force

     The electric accelerator, viz., th&i force-factor which requires to be multiplied
         by a quantity of electricity to convert it into a force ; and

    fThe magnetic accelerator, viz., that orce-factor yihich requires to be multiplied

         by a quantity of magnetism to convert it into a force.

an Electric Field, and the Magnetic Force in a Magnetic Field physical quantities

which are in reality not forces at all, but force-factors.
     There will then remain only one, but it is the greatest offender of them all, viz.,

--Electro-motive Force an abominable term, since it is not a force, nor even a force-

factor. It is in reality an energy-factor. AVhy not substitute the term Potency or
Potential Range, which would exactly describe what it is, and which would offer
the additional convenience of enabling us to .speak, not only of the Potency
of a battery or dynamo, extending over the entire current from pole to pole, but
also of the Potential Range of each piece of apparatus introduced into the circuit
extending from the place where the current enters it to the place where it emerges ?
It is often convenient to be able to speak of this concisely and without periphrasis.
The phrase jjotewcy of a battery seems the most appropriate one for indicating how
much work the battery compels each unit of electricity that traverses the circuit
to do. This is what the term ought to imply ; and the term Potency does so
without introducing a false analogy like the term Pressure which is sometimes

used.

 18. On a Nomenclature for very much Facilitating the Use of Systematic
         Measures. By G. Johnstonk Stoney, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

     In this communication the author recommended certain prefixes and affixes,
which he had been engaged for several years in testing, and which provide a means
of avoiding periphrases and of speaking and thinking concisely about matters with
which modern science has frequently to deal. The syllables suggested are

                                     Hyper-, -ein, -at, -o-, -el, and -ane.

     The metric system of weights and measures furnishes a complete decimal series
of lengths and masses, and of the physical quantities derivable from them, such as
volume, density, &c. : i.e., it presents us not only with the metre, the gram, the
cubic metre, and so on, but also with all the decimal multiples and submultiples of
each of these. Moreover, it only needs to use the metric system with the second
as our unit of time to have an equally complete series of every other physical
quantity, such as density, velocity, force, and energy in dynamics, along with the
various other physical magnitudes with which the sciences of electricity and
magnetism are separately concerned.

Now C.G.S. units are one of the innumerable metric systems of systematic

physical units thus placed at our disposal. This particular system is found to be

inconvenient for  use by practical men                                                                                                 which makes it desirable that  they should

be able on many occasions to avail themselves of other metric systems equally

systematic and in closer relation to their work. This is the more to be recom-

mended since the translation from any such system into the C.G.S. system, in

which our best tables of physical units exist, or from the C.G.S. system into it,

can by the proposed nomenclature be made so conspicuous as to be always certain

and easy. The prefix hyper- and the affix -ein are designed to provide us with

facilities for doing this.

Employing the word weights to designate the pieces of metal used with our

balances, it may be stated to be the usual practice of engineers and physicists to

measure forces by the gravitations of these weights, i.e., by the downward forces

exerted by them at the station where the experimenter works. Now the gravita-

--tions or downward forces of all %ceights, and therefore of the metric series the
--gram weight and its decimal multiples and submultiples vary slightly from one

station on the earth's surface to another; while the decimal series of systematic

forces (determined by the condition that they are the force which will produce an

acceleration of a metre per sec. per sec. in a mass of a kilogram, along with the

decimal multiples and submultiples of this force) is a .system of forces quite inde-

pendent of the place of observation, and therefore each of them maintains the same

value over the whole universe. Here, then, we have two decimal series of forces

one the fixed series required in dynamical calculations, the other the gravitations

or downward forces of the metric weights, convenient in experiments but de-

pending for the amounts of these forces upon the situation where the experiment is
Now --made.
it so happens that the theoretic forces are close to about two per
--cent, more than the laboratory forces ; and hyper-, when prefixed to the name of

a weight, is intended to signify the slight increase which has to be made in it to

make its gravitation become equal to the adjoining theoretical force. Thus in the

language of systematic measures the hektogram, kilogram, &c., are masses ; but the

hyper-hektogram, hyper-kilogram, and so on, are forces, viz., those forces of the

systematic decimal series which are about two percent, more than the gravitations

of the hektogram, the kilogram, and the other metric weights. The prefix

--hyper- may accordingly be paraphrased into '10/^ times the gravitation of the

weight whose mass is a .' The coefficient 10/^, which is indicated by hyper-,
(in which g is gravity at the station where the experiment is made, expressed in

metres per second per second), varies from 1'022 at the equator to 1-017 at the

Mancliester would have to put into one scale of hia balance 101*902 gram weights
(with small corrections for his height over the sea, and for the air displaced by the
weights) in order to urge this scale downwards with precisely that force (the
hyper-hektogram) which, if it acted on a mass of one kilogram, would generate in
it an acceleration of one metre per second per second. This he would express by
saying that the hyper-hektogram (that member of the series of decimal systematic
forces Avhich ditiers but little from the gravitation of a hektogram) is in reality the
gravitation at Manchester of 101-902 gram weights, weighed in vacuo and at the

level of the sea.

     Another affix which will be found convenient is -ein, meaning ' unit of,' so that
the forceiu shall signify the unit of force, the massein the unit of mass, &c., which

we happen at the time to be employing. Thus in the C.G.S. system

          The massein is one gram

                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

          The timein is one second ;

whence

          The forcein is the C.G.S. dyne, which is one hyper-milligram, and
          The energein is the C.G.S. erg, which is the hundred-thousandth part of

               one hyper-grammetre.

     The dyne is far too small a unit of force for convenient use in the laboratory
of the mechanician or even of the physicist. It is the gravitation of a tiny fragment

of note-paper not more than about one-eighth of an inch square. And the erg, the

unit of energy in C.G.S. measure, is still more preposterously small. The gram-
metre is already a small mea.iure of energy, the hyper-grammetre is only about
two per cent, more ; and the err; ti the hundred-thousandth part of this small

measure.

     Much better systems for practical use are the K.M.S. system and the M.M.S.
system. The K.M.S. system, which is based on the kilogram metre and second,

will be found the most convenient in the laboratory of the dynamical physicist.
In this system

          The massein is one kilogram
          The lengthein is one metre and

                                                                                                                                                                   ;

          The energein of one hyper-hektogrammetre, which is equally convenient.

              The supply of this amount of energy per second is what electricians call a

                    ' watt.'

      To the engineer and to the electrician the M.M.S. system offers certain advan-
 tages over that just described ; and either of them is immeasurably to be preferred

     To each of these add one milligram for every 30^ metres (100 British feet) that
the station is above the sea, and add between 15 and 16 milligrams if the weights
are used in air, and if they are brass weights.

    The correction for latitude may be made with sufficient accuracy within the

British Isles by allowing one centigram for every 1° 7' that the station is north of
the latitude of 45°, i.e., one milligram for a difference in latitude of 67 minutes of
arc ; the error of this approximation amounting to only one milligram at Edin-

--burgh, where it is more than at any other of the above stations an enor which is

usually of no account, since no determination of the kind can be made to within less
than a fifthet of its entire amount.

     The densitein = ten grams per litre, in which unit the maximum density of

        water is 100

     The energein = one hyper-kilogrammetre.

Inasmuch as the engineer, if he uses metric weights, determines all his forces in
kilograms and measures energy in kilogrammetres, the M.M.S. system is the most

convenient for him. He has only to increase each of these measures hj TO per

cent, to have his determinations expressed in hyper-kilograms and hyper-kilo-

grammetres, i.e., in systematic measures adapted to any dynamical calculation lie

may have occasion to make. It is also deserving of note that this system is more

conveniently related than the K.M.S. system to the C.G.S. system, "in which our

best tables have been computed. This arises from the circumstance that \/LM

a physical quantity which is constantly turning up in the dimensional equations of
electricity and magnetism, is in the M.M.S. system an exact decimal multiple o'"
what it is in the C.G.S. system. The relation here pointed out is of impoitance

to the electrician.

     The use of the prefix hyper- has the additional advantage of keeping steadilv
before the mind of the student the actual amounts of the measures of force and
energy with which he is dealing, and thus helps him to make his conceptions cor-
respond to the facts of nature. The amount of each measure is not brought into
view by such names as dyne and erg unless supplemented by such names as byper-
milligram and hyper-fifthet-grammetre, and is apt to be lost sight of in using the

C.G.S. system.

     The author was a member of the Committee of the British Association, which in

1873 recommended C.G.S. measures for general adoption by physicists. He put

forward in competition with it the K.M.S. system, spoken of above, and also
advocated the use of the prefix hyper- to be employed as described in this paper.

It is correctly recorded in Everett's ' Units and Physical Constants ' that he dis-
sented from the choice made by (he Committee, but "the reason for his dissent is

not correctly indicatfd. His main objection was that this choice needlessly led to

--such out of the luay values for the dyne and erg needlessly, because other choices

might have been made, such as of either the K.M.S. or the M.M.S. system,
which, while equally adapted to the sciences of electricity and magnetism, would

have been free from this great inconvenience in dynamics. He regrets to have
observed tliat the choice that was then made has retarded the use of systematic
measures by practical men and even by students, and hopes that this may in some
degree be remedied by the suggestions made in the present paper.

     Another useful suffix is -et, meaning decimal submultiple. As applied to

numerals it gives us such suitable names as sixthet, tenthet, seventeenthet for a

unit in the sixth, tenth, and seventeenth places of decimals, which are otherwise

Aexpressed as lO"", 10-'°, lO-^'.                                                                                                                                      convenient symbolical representation is VI<^

X^, XVII^, the symbol ^ being very easily written and being what in Sir Isaac

Pitman's system of shorthand spells thet, so that YI^, X<, XVII^ are to be read

sixthet, tenthet, seventeenthet.

     The suthx -et may also h<^ appended to the names of measures, e.g., metrets are

the decimal subdivisions of i he metre. These in their order are to be spoken of as

the decimetre                                                                  th^ centimetre                                                                     tbe  millimetre;  the IV^m,  the  fourthet-metre, or
                                                                            ;                                                                                  ;

fourth metret; the V^ m tifthet-raetre, or fifth metret; and so on. Thus the

micron used by microbe pists may be described either aa

this last being an abbreviated form of 'sixthet of a metre,' just as half-ounce and
quarter-inch mean the same as half of an ounce and quarter of an inch. Similarly

the measure in which wave-lengths of light are usually measured may be described

indifi'erently as

                                         The tenth metret or as

                                         The tenthet-metre.

     Either of these is to be preferred to the designation tenth-metre, which the

author suggested many years ago,' and which has since been in some degree used.

Either tenth-metret or tenthet-metre is correct, but the author himself prefers the

latter form.

In the same way gramets are the decimal subdivisions of the gram. As an

example of their use, it is possible by the kinetic theory of gases to arrive at an

estimate of the mass of a single chemical atom of each element. That of
XXV^g--hydrogen proves to be about the
                                        the twenty-fifth gramet, or twenty-

fifthet of a gram, i.e., the twenty-fifth of that descending decimal series of which

the decigram, the centigram, and milligram are the first three terms.

     For multiples it is convenient to introduce the syllable -o- : thus, in the case
of numbers, the name uno-eighteeu will mean 10'^, the number which as ordinarilv
written would be 1 with eighteen ciphers after it. (This is about the number of
molecules in each cubic miUimetre of air at the bottom of our atmosphere.) The

above number may be symbolised by XVIII, and so on in other cases. Again,
this_ affix may be appended to such words as metre, gram, &c. Thus the velocity

of light in vacuo is to be written 3mVIII/sec., and is to be read ' three metro-

eights per second.' In like manner a tonne weight (the metric ton) is the gramo-
six, and so on.-

      Other useful affixes are -el and -ane : -el to be applied to British measures of

length, -ane to metric. An accordance between British and metric measures
of length may be brought about in either of two ways--either by slightlv

shortening the British inch, foot, and yard, or else by in an equal degree' lengthen'-

ing the metre. In the one case the British foot is shortened do wn^to be e'xactly

30 centimetres, in the other case the metre is lengthened out to be exactly 40 inches.

The syllable -el may be used to indicate the change required in the yard, foot, and
inch. Accordingly the words iuchel, footel, and yardel will mean the inch, foot,

and yard shortened in the ratio of 63^ : 62^, or, which is the same thing, in the

ratio of 101-6 to 100. On the other hand, the syllable -ane may be ''used to

signify an equal change in the opposite direction of metric measures, so that the
metrane, decimetrane, centimetrane, and millimetrane are to be understood as the

metric measures lengthened in the same ratio, i.e., as 62^ : 63^. With this con-
vention as to the meaning of the affixes we may write

              one inchel = 25 millimetres,

              one footel = 30 centimetres,
              one yardel = 9 decimetres,

and again               = (1 -A) metre;

              one inch  = 25 millimetranes,
              one foot  = 30 centimetranes
              One yard  = 9 decimetranes,
                        = (1 - tV) metrane.'

      (Light in vacuo advances almost exactly one footel in each ninthet of a second
of time.)

     "^ It would, no doubt, be more in consonance with the genius of the English
language to call these the eighteenth uno, the eighth metro, the sixth gramo, and so
on; but this consideration seems more than balanced by the great advantao-e
possessed by the names as given in the text, of distinguishing in the broadelt
possible way between multiples and submultiples.

   mm' The numbers we should otherwise have to use are: inch = 25-4    foot

= 30-48 cm., yard = 9-144 dm.

    The use of these equivalents makes it easy for persons who are accustomed to
the British yard, foot, and inch to think also in metric measures. They also

furnish a liiik between British and metric measures which yields a ready means

of effecting- a closely approximate conversion of either into the other. For

example, if we want to convert 27 yards into metres we write

             27 yards = -(1 ,3jy) x 27 metranes

             -_ \/ -  27

                        2-7

             = 24:*o metranes.

     The correction of 1 in every 62'5 (which is the same as -1 in every 6^, or as
·02 in every 1^) requires the addition of rather less than

             + ·4

which gives  24-7 metres

as the approximate equivalent. The accurate value differs from this by less
than half an inch, and, moreover, by continuing the process two steps further the
accurate value may always be got out. The calculation is of a kind which, when

one is accustomed" to it, can be made in the head rapidly and with ease.

    3. A New Explanation of the Wave-movements of a Stretched String.
                                    By Wm. Barlow.

     The writer begins by setting out the commonly received explanation which
attributes to the string when disturbed the properties of a cord slipping through a
bent tube at a velocity such as to make the pressure on the tube arising from the
centrifugal force just balance the pressure caused by the tension.'

    He then argues that this course involves the fallacy that a wave-movement is

supposed to take place spontaneously in the disturbed cord, whereas all that the
argument offered proves is that if a wave is set up and travels at a certain rate in a
given direction, it toill have a constant form.

    He further shows that the conditions laid down do not suffice to determine the

direction of the wave ; that the direction is perfectly arbitrary.
     He then suggests another explanation of the wave-movements in question.
     This is based on the observed behaviour of a highly elastic cord, and he attri-

buted the wave-movement to the successive orientation of segments of the stretched
string caused by a difference of tension due to inertia, the spot at which the
difference makes itself felt travelling along the string, now in one direction, now
in the opposite, as the string swings from side to side of its normal position.

6. On Lunar Curves of Mean Temperature at Greenwich, and the
              Heat of the Moon. By J. Park Harrison.

The great heat experienced in 1893 led the author to tabulate the mean tem-

peratures of the day at Greenwich for that year, according to the age of the pioon,

to see how far a curve derived from ihem corresponded with the model curve for
618 lunations, which was exhibited by him on the last occasion when the British

Association visited Oxford. Whilst closely following the curve alluded to, the

maximum temperature showed itself two days earlier in the lunation ; but the

same abrupt fall in temperature occurred immediately after the first quarter, and
continued below the average of the year from that period until the second day after

last quarter. The difference between the maximum on the fourth day of the lunation
and the minimum on the day of full moon was 6^ Fahr. for twelve complete

lunations.

              Section B.--CHEMICAL SCIENCE.

--President of the Section Profeasor Haeold B. Dixon, M.A., F.R.S.

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

The President delivered the following- Address :

                ^An Oxford School of Chemists.'

It has heen said, and no doubt with truth, that few Presidents of Sections start

writing an address without referring to that of their predecessor who held office on
the last occasion when the Association met in the same city. By such reference
each new President gains the advantage of many points of perspective and con-

trast ; for in the interval a generation of workers has passed away, and the last

new thing of the old meeting is the ancient instance of to-day. In the present

case I turned to the Report of 1860 with a lively hope of drawing inspiration from

it; for my predecessor at the last Oxford meeting was no less a master of experiment
and expression than the late Professor Brodie. Judge of my disappointment when

I found that Brodie had written no address at all. Whether that great man,

knowing there were better things to do here than listen to addresses, had the

courage to make an innovation he thought desirable in itself, or whether, as others

say, he was but obeying the etiquette of the Oxford professoriate, the fact remains,

the assembled chemists went away unaddressed, and the natural spring of inspira-

tion for the address of 1894 is found dry at its source. Of course you will say,

Why* do you not follow such a good example ? ' I wish I had the courage. As

--it is, I can but urge the vacuum of 1860 as some excuse for the emptiness of the

address I now present compelled to do so partly by the force of fashion and the

demands of the assistant general secretary, and (shall I add ?) partly by the grati-

myfication of holding forth, with a little brief authority, in  old academic home,

endeared to me personally by so many happy memories, and hallowed in the minds

of chemists by the traditions of such great achievements in the science we pursue.

     I say traditions advisedly, for the chemical achievements spoken of were largely

forgotten, or put on one side as guesses and half-truths. No chemist here will need

reminding that I refer to the first school of scientific chemistry, the school founded

two centuries and a half ago by Robert Boyle with his disciples Hooke and Mayow

--a group whom I will venture to call ' the Oxford school of chemists.' And now

that chemists are met together once more in Oxford it seemed to me not inappro-

priate for us to consider what this school of chemists accomplished, and wherein it

failed, what led to the sudden growth and what to the decline of chemical investi-

gation here, and what lessons for modern Oxford may be read in the history of that

rise and fall.

The intellectual awakening which followed the re-discovery of the ancient

world of literature gave rise to the scientific interrogation of nature. In Italy

first, and then in France, England, and in Germany, the diffusion of classical

learning broke down the ancient barriers of restraint, and developed a spirit of free
                                 --

inquiry. It was not so much that ignorance had to be dispelled, but that the right

--of search had to be established. Here and there during the Middle Ages some man

of genius had arisen learned beyond all his contemporaries, intrepid in the pursuit

--of truth only to be crushed by a political and mental despotism. The name of

Roger Bacon arises at once in our thoughts, who from his Oxford cell sent forth
that great appeal for experimental science that nearly converted a Pope of Rome

and won three centuries for intellectual freedom. But his labour bore no fruit.

I know no better index to the dominant sentiment of the time than the following

words from a papal rescript reproving the members of an Italian university for

scientific presumption : ' They must be content with the landmarks of science

already fixed by their fathers, and have due fear of the curse pronounced against

liioi who removeth his neiufhbour's landmark.' Under such conditions no wonder

philosophy was at a standstill. ' The same knots were tied and untied ; the same
clouds were formed and dissipated.'' The cramped philosophy of the Middle Ages

--had in alchemy a fitting colleague with its mysticism, its sordid ideals, its trickery,

and its arrogance. The revival of learning was thus an emancipation of the mind,
and in the new freedom the sciences of mechanics, physics, and chemistry arose.

The first necessity for progress was enlightenment, the second was experiment : in
the year that Francis Bacon died Robert Boyle was born.

The common pursuit of experimental inquiry and the need for constant criticism

and discussion among its followers led to the foundation of scientific societies.

Such societies, which have greatly influenced the progress of knowledge, sprang up

--in Florence and Padua, in Paris and Oxford wherever, among bodies of learned

men, some were found iu sympathy with natural philosophy. Among these associa-

tions the Philosophical Society of Oxford has played no unimportant part, and,

however much Oxford may have undervalued its work, for one thing all chemists

--are grateful, and Oxford herself may feel proud that here, under her influence,

fii'St grew up the idea that chemistry was no mere drudge of medicine, or genii of

the alchemist, but a science to be studied purely for itself.

The origin of this Oxford Society has been well told by Dr. Wallis, one of its

founders :

     ' About the year 1G45, while I lived in London (at a time when, by our civil
wars, academic studies were much interrupted at both Universities), besides the

conversation of eminent divines, I had the opportunity of being acquainted with

divers worthy persons inquisitive into natural philosophy, and particularly of what

Wehath been called experimental philosophy.        did by agreements meet weekly in

London to treat and discourse of such aflFairs; of which number were Dr. John

Wilkins, Dr. Jonathan Goddard, Dr. Eat, Dr. Merret, Mr. Samuel Foster, then

Professor of Astronomy in Gresham College, and Mr. Theodore Haak, and many

others.

' These meetings we held sometimes at Dr. Goddard's lodgings, on occasion of

his keeping an operator at his house for grinding glasses for telescopes and micro-

scopes                           sometimes at a convenient place in Cheapside,  and  sometimes at  Gresham
                              ;

College. Our business was (precluding matters of theology and State afluirs) to

discourse and consider of philosophical inquiries. . . . About the year 1648, some
of our company being removed to Oxford (first Dr. Wilkins, then I, and soon after
Dr. Goddard), our company divided. Those in London continued to meet there

as before, and those of us at Oxford, with Dr. Seth Ward (since Bishop of
Salisbury), Dr. Ralph Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Dr Petty, Dr. Willis

(an eminent physician in Oxford), and divers others, continued such meetings in

Oxford, and brought those studies into fashion there, meeting first at Dr. Petty's

lodgings (in an apothecarie's house), because of the convenience of inspecting drugs,

and, after his removal, at the lodgings of Dr. Wilkins, then Warden of Wadham

College, and, after his removal, at the lodgings of the Honourable Mr. Robert

Boyle, then resident for divers years in Oxford.'

was sent at twelve years of age with a tutor to the Continent ; he remained abroad

for six jears. He studied chiefly at Geneva and at Florence, where he read the

works of Galileo. Returning to Eng-land in 1644, he busied himself with chemistry

at Stalbridgf, a manor in Dorsetshire left him by his father. On his visits to

J^ondon he became one of the members of the 'Invisible College,' the germ of the

lioyal Society. 'Vulcan has so bewitched me,' he writes at the age of twenty-

three, 'as to make me fancy my laboratory a kind of elysium.'

Drawn to Oxford in 1654, Boyle spent here the most active years of his life in

experimental researcli. Of Boyle's scientific writings much lias been said in extra-

vagant praif-e and much in ridicule. Boerhaave wrote : ' To him we owe the

secrets of fire, air, water, animals, vegetables, and fossils.' This phrase is not

more grotesque than that of a recent writer, who says, ' Boyle's name is identified

with no great discovery.' Br. Johnson has very justly remarked, in a number of

the 'Rambler:' ' It is well known how much of our philo.sopby is derived from

Boyle's discoveries, yet very few have read the details of his experiments. Hi»

name is indeed reverenced, but his works are neglected.' It is, indeed, rather hard

to read through one of Boyle's papers, even in the abridged form. Though clear,

they are discursive. The writer cannot rid himself entirely of the essences and
qualities of the alchemists ; and it is only when we compare these records with

the works of Van Helmont, his immediate predecessor, that we recognise the

enormous advance that has been made by Boyle. I must pass over his physical

work on the elasticity of the air. It must suffice to say that he established by

--most careful experiment the law which is known by his name that the volume of

a given mass of air varies inversely as the pressure upon it. He determined the

density of the air, and pointed out that bodies altered in weight according to the

--varying buoyancy of the atmosphere. One of his most important chemical papers

certainly the one most frequently cited is 'The Sceptical Chemist,' published

anonymously in 1661. I will attempt the briefest account of it. The opening

words of the dialogue strike the keynote of the whole :

' Notwithstanding the subtle reasonings of the Peripatetics and the pretty

experiments of the Chymists, I am so diilident as to think that, if neither cao

produce more cogent arguments than are usually given, a man may reasonably

doubt as to the number of those material ingredients of mixed bodies which some

call elements and others principles.' He proceeds, through the mouth of one of

the supposed disputants, to attack the doctrine of the three elements, the tria

prima of the alchemists-- sulphur, mercury, and salt. ' There are some bodies,' he

says, 'from which it has not yet been made to appear that any degree of fire can

separate either salt, or sulphur, or mercury, much less all the three. Gold is the

most obvious instance. It may be heated for months in a furnace without losing

weight or altering in character, and yet one of its supposed constituents is volatile

and another combustible. Neither can water or solvents separate any of the three

principles from gold ; the metal may be added to, and so brought into solution and

into crystalline compounds, but the gold particles are present all the time ; and

the metal may be reduced to the same weight of yellow, ponderous, malleable
substance it was before its mixture.' He points out the confusion which earlier

chemists had  made  between  calcination in the open air and distillation in  retorts
                                                                                                     ;

he shows that in compounds, e.g., copper nitrate, the particles retain their nature,

although disguised, in the combination, for the nitric acid may be separated by

heat, the copper by precipitation. But the sceptical chemist, though pouring-

ridicule on the tria prima, could not but admit the power of water to produce

organic substances. He quotes Van Helmont's famous experiment of growing a

shoot of willow in baked earth moistened with distilled water, and he repeats the

experiment in various forms. Ignorant of the existence of carbonic acid in the

air (discovered a century later by Black), he is driven to conclude that the plant

--is fashioned out of the pure water. But he rejects the doctrine as old as Thales
--j»nd as modern as Van Helmont that water is the foundation of all things.

M. de Rochas had publisbeJ a remarkable experiment on water. By artificial

heat, by graduations of coagulations and congelations, he had turned it into earth

which produced animals, vegetables, and minerals. The minerals began to grow

and increase, and were composed of much salt, little siilplinr, and less mercury
the animals moved and ate, and were composed of much sulphur, little mercurv,

and less salt. ' I have some suspicions,' says Boyle, ' concerning this strange

relation; thougrh, as for the jreneration of livinuf creatures, both vegetable and

sensitive, it need not seem incredible, since we find that our common water, which

is often imprefrnated with a variety of seeds, lon^^ kept in a quiet place, will

putrefy, and then, too, produce moss and little worms according to the nature of

the seeds that were lurking in it.'

I will give two short quotations from the ' Sceptical Chemist,' which show the

author at his best and his worst. In the first he is discussing the nature of

chemical combination between elementary particles : ' There are clusters wherein

the particles stick not so close together, but they may meet with corpuscles of

another denomination, disposed to be more closely united with some of them than
they were among themselves; and in such case two corpuscles thus combining,

losing that shape, size, or motion upon whose account they exhibited such a
determinate quality, each of them really ceases to be a corpuscle of the same de-

nomination as it was before ; and from the coalition of these there may result a new

body, as really one as either of the corpuscles before they were confounded. . . If
you dissolve minium in good spirit of vinegar and crystallise the solution, you

shall not only have a saccharine salt exceedingly different from both its' in-

gredients, but the union is so strict that the spirit of vinegar seems to be destroyed

. . . for there is no sourness at all, but an admirable sweetness to be tasted in "the

concretion.' In this passage we can distinctly see the germ of the modern theory

of chemical affinity uniting atoms into chemical compounds. In the second

quotation Boyle is arguing that fire is not only an analyser of mixtures, but

compounds the ingredients of bodies after a new manner ; mercury, for instance,
may be turned into a liquid, from which the mercury cannot be reduced again, and
consequently is more than a * disguise ' of it. ' Two friends of mine,' he says,
^ both of them per.sons of unsuspected credit, have solemnly assured me that after
many trials they made to reduce mercury into water, "they once, by several

cohobations, reduced a pound of quicksilver into almost a pound of water, and this

without the addition of any substance, but only by urging the mercury with a fire

skilfully managed. Hence it appears that by means of fire we may obtain from a
mixed body what did not pre-e.xist therein.' Boyle has sometimes been charged
with credulity, and chemists who know how mercury has a way of disappearing

without leaving even its weight of water behind will smile to hear that the persons

of unsuspected credit responsible for this experiment were 'the one a physician,

the other a distinguished mathematician.'

Boyle's writings contain the record of numerous important chemical observations,

e.g., the synthesis of nitre,and the preparation of nitric acid by the distillation of nitre

Hewith oil of vitriol.       discovered several of the delicate tests we still use, e./;., solution

of ammonia as a test for copper, silver nitrate as a test for chlorides, gallic acid as

a test for iron. But I wish especially to refer to the work done by Boyle on the

air and its relation to combustion. The air, according to him, was composed of

three different              kinds of particles :  (1) exhalations from water  and animals                                                            (2)  a
                                                                                                                                                   ;

very subtle emanation from the earth's magnetism, which produces the sensation of

light; and (8) a tiuid compressible and dilatable, having weight, and able to refract

light. It is this third portion of air which plays an active part in many chemical
operations. Like Van Helmont, Boyle recognised differences in gases, but did not
distinguish them as being something different in kind from air. He prepared

hydrogen by the action of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids on iron, but his chief

concern was to show that the new gas was compressible and was dilatable by

heat                         in other Avords, that it was really air.  His observations are worth quoting";
                          ;

they contain, I believe, the first undoubted description of hydrogen, and the first
method devised for collecting and examining freshly prepared gases.

     ' Having provided a saline spirit . . . exceedingly sharp and piercing, we put into a

viol a convenient quantity of tilings of steel, purposely filed from a piece of good
fiteel. This metalline powder being moistened with the menstruum was afterwards
drenched with more, whereupon the mixture grew very hot, and belched up copious

and stinking fumes. . . . Whencesover this stinking smoak proceeded, so in-
Hammable was it, that upon the approach of a lighted candle it would readily-

enough take fire, and burn with a blewish and somewhat greenish flame at the
mouth of the -viol ; and that, though with little light, yet with more strength than

one would easily suspect.'

WeAnd again : '  took a clear glass vial, capable of containing three ounces of

water, with a long cylindiical neck ; this we Ulled Avith oil of vitriol, and fair

water, of each a like quantity, and casting in six small iron nails we stopped the

mouth of the glass, and speedily inverting it, we put the neck of it into a wide-

mouthed glass with more of the same liquor in it. . . . And soon after we per-

ceived the bubbles, produced by the action of the menstruum upon the metal,

ascending in swarms; by degrees they depressed the liquor till, at length, the

Fubstance contained in these bubbles possessed the whole cavity of the vial. And

for three or four days and nights together the cavity of the glass was possessed by

the air, since by its spring it was able for so long a time to hinder the liquor from

regaining its foinier place. Just before we took the vial out of the other glass,
upon the application of the warm hand to the convex part of the glass, the im-

prisoned substance readily dilated itself like air, and broke through the liquor in

several succeeding bubbles.'

The importance of this experiment will be evident when we consider that Van

Helmont had declared that gases could be made artificially in many ways, but

could not be caught and held in vessels.^

    Armed with the air-pump which he had so greatly improved, Boyle in 1660

began many experiments on combustion, which he afterwards published under the

title ' New Experiments touching the Relation betwixt Plame and Air.' In these

researches he shows that sulphur will not burn when the air is removed. The

sulphur was lowered on to a hot iron plate in a receiver made vacuous by the
pump ; it smoked, but did not ignite. On allowing a little air to enter ' divers

little flashes could be seen : ' these were extinguished on sucking out the air again.

A candle flame and a hydrogen flame under a receiver were gradually extinguished

when the air was pumped away. On the other hand, on dropping gunpowder on

to a hot iron plate in vacuo there appeared ' a broad blue flame like that of brim-

stone, which lasted so very long we could not but wonder at it ; and fulminating
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         '

gold detonated tn vacuo when heated by a burning glass, or when dropped on

heated iron. Gunpowder also he found to burn under water. He is driven to the

conclusion ' that flame may exist without air.' But it may be supposed that air

--is mechanically enclosed in the crystals of nitre ' in its very formation the

corpuscles may intercept store of little aereal particles. . . . According to this

surmise, though our mixture burns under water, yet it does not burn without air,

being supplied with enough to serve the turn by the numerous eruptions of the

aereal particles of the dissipated nitre.' However, he * removes this suspicion ' by

obtaining nitre crystallised in vacuo. He then suggests the possibility of the nitre

supplying ' vehemently agitated vapours ' which are no true air, but being exceed-

ingly rarefied by the fire ' emulate air.' Boyle never grasped the true function of

air in combustion. From his later experiments on the calcination of metals he

drew the same conclusion that we find in the ' Sceptical Chemist,' namely, that

igneous particles combine with other corpuscles to form new bodies. And yet he

saw there was a real connection between air and fire. In his tract on Artificial

Phosphor! Boyle showed that a piece of phosphorus sealed up in a glass vessel

gradually lost its light. ' It seems,' he wrote, ' that the air included with the

phosphorus either had some vital substance preyed upon thereby, or else was tamed

by the fumes of the phosphorus and rendered at length unfit to continue the

particular flame of our noctiluca.'

The genius of Robert Hooke was in sharp contrast with that of Boyle.

Quick, restless, imaginative, he sprang from discovery to discovery. With extra-

ordinary acuteness and powers of invention, he lacked the steady purpose of

--Boyle, the calm judgment and completeness of Newton his two great scientific

contemporaries. It might be said of Hooke, as was said of a great poet, he

touched nothing he did not strike fire from ; and some would add that his touch

Wehad the same effect on persons as on things.  can hardly name a discovery

of this age which Hooke had not in part anticipated and claimed as his own.

Like a prospector in a newly discovered mining district, he hurried from spot to

spot, pegging in his claims and promising to return to work out the ore. And

what rich lodes he struck ! The particular claim we are concerned with here is

the discovery of the relation between air and flame. In 1665 Hooke published

in the ' Micrographia ' a description of flame and the phenomena of combustion

which in my judgment has never been surpassed. How far he was indebted to

Boyle will appear directly.

    Born in 1635, Hooke spent five years at Westminster School, then under
Dr. Busby, and proceeded to Christ Church in 1653. At school and college it is
related of him that he devoted his time to designing flying machines. These

mechanical inventions attracted the notice of Dr. Wilkins, Warden of Wadham,
and a leading member of the Philosophical Society. This led to his introduction
to Dr. Willis, to whom he became assistant in chemistry and natural philosophy.

Willis recommended him to Boyle, whose assistant he became. His first work in

Boyle's laboratory was the construction of the improved air-pump. In 1662
Boyle obtained for him the position of curator of experiments in the London
Society, soon to be known as the Royal Society. Hooke was thus Boyle's
assistant when those experiments on combustion I have described were being

carried on. Among other experiments made by Boyle were some on the dis-
tillation of wood in retorts.

' Having sometimes distilled such woods as box, whilst our caput mortuum

[i.e., the residue] remained in the retort it continued black liije charcoal, though

the retort were kept red hot in a vehement fire; but as soon as ever it was
brought out of that vessel into the open air the burning coals would degenerate

or fall asunder into pure white ashes.' ^ Hooke saw the experiment and a new
light flashed on him. 'From the experiment of charring coals,' he writes,
' (whereby we see that, notwithstanding the great heat, the solid parts of the

wood remain, whilst they are preserved from the free access of the air, undissi-
pated) we may learn that which has not been published or hinted, nay, not so
much as thought of by any ; and that in short is this :

' That the air is the imiversal dissolvent of all sulphurous [i.e., combustible]

bodies. . . .

* That this action of dissolution produces a very great heat, and that which we

call fire.

' That this action is performed with so great a violence, and does so rapidly

agitate the smallest parts of the combustible matter, that it produces in the

diaphanous medium of the air the action, or pulse oi Light.

' That this dissolution is made by a substance inherent and mixed with the

air, that is like, if not the very same with, that which is mixed in saltpetre.
     ' That the dissolving parts of the air are but few . , . whereas saltpetre is a

menstruum . . . that abounds more with these dissolvent particles.
     ' It seems reasonable to think that there is no such thing as an element of

fire, . . . but that that shining transient body which we call flame is nothing

else but a mixture of air and volatile parts of combustible bodies, which are
acting upon one another whilst they ascend; which action , . . does further

rarifie those parts that are acting or are very near them, whereby they, growing

very much lighter than the heavy parts of that menstruum that are more remote,

are thereby protruded and driven upwards.'

    Hooke quotes no other experiments in support of his theory of flame. He

states that he has made many ; he has, however, only time * to hint an hypo-

thesiB,' wbicli if he is permitted opportunity he will ' pi-oseciite, improve," and

publish.' Some years later he returned to the subject of flame in his tract called

' Lampas,' published ia 1677. 'The flame, as I formerly proved, being nothing-
but the parts of the oyl rarified and raised by heat into the form of a vapour or
smoak, the free air that encompasseth this vapour keepeth it into a cylindrical
form, and by its dissolving property preyeth upon those parts of it that are
outwards, . . . producing the light which we observe ; but those parts which
rise from the wick which are in the middle are not turned to shining flame till
they rise towards the top of the cone, where the free air can reach and so dissolve
them. With the help of a piece of glass anyone will plainly perceive that all the
middle of the cone of flame neither shines nor burns, but only the outward super-
ficies thereof that is contiguous to the free and unsatiated air.'

    What is practically the same theory of flame was worked out experimentally
by John Mayow, Fellow of All Souls : this was published a few years after the

' Micrographia.'

    But Mayow went further, and distinctly showed the dual nature of the air.

One constituent of air, the nitre air, is concerned in respiration and combustion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the other will neither support flame nor animal life. The ideas, the names, pro-

posed by Hooke and Mayow are so exactly similar that it is impossible to

imagine that the work was done independently. The two were working at the

same time at Oxford, and Mayow, having been an undergraduate at Wadham

under Dr. Wilkins, became the pupil of Willis. Yet Mayow nowhere mentions

AHooke's name.        writer in the ' Dictionary of National Biography ' ' has shrewdly

observed that Hooke has brought no charge of plagiarism against Mayow, anil

even proposed him for the Royal Society four years after the publication of the

' Five Tracts.' Knowing what we do of Hooke's jealousy, it seems exceedingly

unlikely that Mayow was merely working out Hooke's ideas. It seems to me

probable that Hooke and Mayow worked together under Boyle between 1660 and

1662 ; that in Boyle's laboratory they saw and assisted in the experiments which

led them jointly to their theory ; that Hooke, busy with other work in London,

published the hypothesis in 1(:65 without further verification; and that Mayow in

Oxford systematically worked through the e.xperiments on which he based his

conclusions.

    Let me briefly show what the experiments were on which Mayow relied.

Combustible bodies will not burn in the vacuous receiver of Boyle's air-pump
they will burn in vacuo or under water when mixed with nitre. There is, there-

fore, something common to air and to nitre which causes combustion. The fiery

particles in air and in nitre both form oil of vitriol by their union with sulphur ; they

both form iron vitriol by their union with pyrites. Rust of iron is produced both

by the air and by acid of nitre ; the acids of sugar and honey are formed, and wine
is soured, in the same way. The nitre-air (spiritus nitro-aereus), the supporter
of combustion and the acid producer, is therefore the same chemical substance
whether it exist in the gaseous form in air or is condensed in saltpetre.

    Mayow heated a weighed quantity of antimony by means of a burning glass,

and found it increased in weight during the calcination ; - the calcined antimony,
he adds, has the same properties as the body prepared by heating antimony with
nitric acid ; it is impossible to conceive, he says, whence the increase in weight

arises except by the fixation of the particles of nitre-air during the heating.
     The nitre-air does not make up the whole of the air, but only its more active

and subtle part, for a candle under a glass will cease to burn while there is still

plenty of air left. The experiment by which Mayow shows this is so important

that i will quote his words :

' Let a lighted candle be so placed in water that the burning wick shall rise

about  six  fingers'  breadth  above  the water                                                  then  let  a  glass vessel of  sufficient
                                                                                              ;

water within the glass shall be equal in height to that without, which may be

done by including one leg of a bent sypbon witbin tbe vessel while the other opens

outside. Tbe object of the syplion is that tbe air, enclosed by the vessel and com-

pressed by its immersion into the water, may escape through tbe hollow sypbon.

When the air ceases to issue, tbe sypbon is immediately withdrawn, so tliat no air

can afterwards get into the glass. In a short time you will see the water gradually

rising into tbe vessel while the candle still burns.'

In other experiments be burnt camphor and sulphur supported on a shelf in the

inverted vessel. The water rose, he says, because, owing to the disappearance of

the fire-air, tbe air left could not resist the pressure of tbe atmosphere outside.

When the combustibles were extinguished it was impossible to kindle them again

by means of tbe sun's rays concentrated on them by a burning glass. The residual

air was no more able to support combustion than the vacuum of Boyle's engine.

Again, tbe respiration of animals in the closed space was shown to diminish the

air, and to render it incapable of supporting combustion ; the fire-air was as

necessary for life as for flame. The larger portion of the air was something

entirely different from fire-air, and incapable of supporting life or combustion. I

beheve this to be the first definite statement founded on experiment that the air is

composed of two distinct gases.

I have given  tbe fundamental    facts in chemistry we owe to  Mayow                                                     the limits

--always distinguish between the gas itself and tbe heat produced by its action. But

the advance he made was extraordinary not so much in the conclusions lie drew

as in the experiments and arguments be founded them on. Compare him for a

moment with another writer who had previously expressed similar views concerning

tbe calcination of metals. Jean Rey, of Perigourd, a witty and shrewd physician,

published in 1630 a series of essays attributing tbe increase in weight of metals on

Whencalcination to the fixation of the air. '  asked,' he writes, ' why tin and lead

increase in weight on calcination, I reply and gloriously maintain that this increase

comes from tbe air which is thickened and made heavy and adhesive by tbe long

continued heat of the furnace. This air mingles with the calx and attaches itself

to the smallest particles.' The reply is good, but the reasons that gloriously main-

--tain it are not altogether conclusive. I can only give two of them : (1) The air

has weight. This is shown by the increase in velocity of heavy bodies falling to

the earth, because as the body approaches the earth it subtends a wider angle from

the centre of the earth, and receives more shocks from the particles of air. Again,

although tbe air appears to weigh nothing on the balance, this is because we weigh

it in air; it loses its weight, just as water weighs nothing in water. Fire has

weight too, and should we ever find ourselves in a region where fire is the pre-

dominant element, we shall be able to prove the statement in the same way.

--(2) Fire can thicken and make air heavy. Stand a cannon upright and put a red-

hot ball into it. You must admit that the air in the gun is so small in quantity

that it will be heated to the same temperature as the ball. Nevertheless you can

hold your hand in the mouth of the gun at first, but in a short time you cannot

do 80. Not that the air has got hotter, it is cooling all tbe time ; it is because the

air is thickened. Now if you drop a fleece of wool into the mouth, it will not

descend, and if you push it in, it will come up again, proving the air is heavier.

Lastly the air is seen to tremble over the mouth of tbe gun, and objects seen

through it are blurred. This is due to the thickening, it cannot be due to a motion

of the air ; ' for I see,' he says, ' a lady's beauty quite distinctly through tbe air she

flutters with her fan.'

    From what has been stated it will be clear that the Oxford School of Chemistry
was a school of research. Boyle gave no instruction in tbe ordinary sense ; and,

indeed, bad no official connection with the University. But that be thought instruc-

tion in chemistry should be given in the University is obvious from the fact that
he brought over a chemist from Strasburg, and set him up as a lecturer with rooms

--next his own and the use of his laboratory. Of these lectures we find a quaint

account in Anthony Wood's diary :
602 REPORT-- 1894.

'An. Dom. 1663.

* Began a course of chemistry under the noted chemist and rosicrucian,

Peter Sthael, of Strasburgh, brought to Oxon. by the hon. Mr, Rob. Boyle,

an. 1659. He took to him scholars in the house of John Cross next on the

w. side to University CoUe. The club consisted of 10 at least, whereof Francis

Turner of New Coll. was one, Ben WoodrofF of Ch. Ch. another, and John Lock

of the same house, afterwards a noted writer. This John Lock was a man of
turbulent spirit, clamorous and never contented. The club wrote and took notes
from the mouth of their master, who sat at the upper end of the table, but the
said J. Lock scorned to do it ; so that while every man besides were writing, he

would be prating and troublesome. After the beginning of the year 1663

Mr. Sthael removed his elaboratory to a draper's house, called John Bowell, after-

wards mayor of the city, situate in the parish of All Saints. He built his

elaboratory in an old hall in the back, for the house itself had been an ancient

hostle ; therein A. W. and his fellows were instructed. The chemical club con-

got some knowledge and experience, but his mind still hung after antiquities and

musick.'

     In spite of Boyle's private position, his blameless life, his devoutness, and his

charity, his work aroused bitter animosity in Oxford. He was attacked in the

University pulpit, in public orations, in private squibs ; his theories were described

as destructive of religion, his experiments as undermining the University. But
what chiefly drew the indignation of his opponents was that he, a gentleman by

birth and fortune, should concern himself with low mechanical arts. Against

these attacks Boyle replied with iiTesistible logic. His vindication of the nobility

of scientific work constitutes one of his greatest claims on our gratitude.

    Boyle left Oxford in 1668. Mayow died in 1679. In 1683 Anthony Wood

informs us that ' the Oxford elaboratory was quite finished ; ' but the impulse given
to the study of Chemistry in Oxford gradually died out. I do not know the

history of the Chair of Chemistry in Oxford (if there was one) in the eighteenth

century. Richard Frewin, of Christ Church, is described as Professor of Chemistry in

1708. He does not seem to have taken himself too seriously in this capacity.
Uftenbach, who visited Oxford in 1710, says he found the stoves in fair condition,

but everything else in the laboratory in dirt and disorder. Fre\vin himself was

elected Camden Professor of Ancient History in 1727. He seems to have thrown

himself into his new work with greater ardour ; for Hearne relates that, on his

election, he at once bought one hundred pounds' worth of books in chronology and

history to fit himself for his duties. For a companion picture to this we may

glance at the appointment in 1764 of Richard Watson (afterwards Bishop of

Llandaff") to the Chair of Chemistry at Cambridge, which had been founded in

1702. Dr. Watson, we are told, knew nothing at all of chemistry ; had never
read a syllable nor seen a single experiment on the subject. On his election he

sent to Paris for an ' operator,' and set to work in his laboratory. In fourteen

months he began to lecture to a large audience.

WeBut Watson at Cambridge was succeeded by Wollaston.  had to wait till

   We have seen what a vigorous effort Chemistry made to plant itself in Oxford

in the seventeenth century. If the soil had been prepared the roots must have
struck deep. But the University paid little heed, and after a few years of prodigal
growth the plant withered and died out. It would seem that the positions are
reversed at the present day. The University spends large sums for supervision
and appliances ; the young plants are brought here and nurtured at great expense,
but the fair blossoms produce little fruit. Even our best friends admit that the

--results are somewhat disappointing. If these are the facts and I speak as one
--who shares the responsibility for the present condition of chemistry here it is the

duty of those concerned to speak out ; and I can conceive no more fitting oppor-

tunity than the present for pointing out some of the causes that appear to hinder
(uir growth. Let no one think I wish to disparage the University. I should be

the last person to do so. I owe to my old college the opportunity, the help, and
the example which made me a chemist, and gave me an interest in life. I only
wish to see more general tlie advantages it was my luck to meet with in Christ

Church.
     Chemistry in modern Oxford is accorded a place side by side with older studies.

No one can complain that scholarships are not offered broadcast, that money has

not been freely given for laboratories ; and yet I think the student does not feel

around him the atmosphere in which an experimental science should be cultivated.

We see Chemistry endowed and extended, we do not see it respected by the bulk

of students and of learned men. In my undergraduate days a rhyme was current

--here (I think it was coined in Cambridge the Parnassus of parodies) expressing

views which were undoubtedly held concerning the claims of chemistry as a sub-

--ject for a degree. One verse ran it was from the Lamentation of a would-be

Bachelor

                 I had better take up Chemistry, which is commonly called " Stinks."

I do not quarrel with the versifier (except as a poet), I do not even quarrel

with the reverend tutor, whose opinion of us is obviously small, because I do not

think myself that Chemistry as it is taught is a very good subject for a degi'ee.

Still less is it a subject which we should allow to monopolise the schoolboy's time.

While holding strongly that the elements of Physics and Chemistry form a neces-

sary part of a liberal education, I believe we have made two mistakes with regard

Weto the teaching of science.  have by our science scholarships encouraged too

learns that it is advisable to get assistance from those who have made a special

study of preparing candidates for pass examinations. He crams ; or he goes to a

crammer and is crammed. Let us suppose, as is usually the case, that the obstacle

is Greek. I will not deny that the standard of Greek demanded may imply some

important discipline at school, and some real culture of the mind, provided the

instruction given is on wholesome lines and forms part of a liberal course. Got

up in a hiu-ry as it too often is, solely with the object of passing, it means time

and effort wasted and worse than wasted. It is of no value in itself, for it is

forgotten in less time than it took to acquire ; and it gives the student the first

pernicious taste of that superficiality and false knowledge it should be our special

aim to remove. Is it not desirable that scholarships should be the reward of pro-

gress and ability in the general subjects of school education among which the
elements of science should have a place ? The brightest and most persevering boys

would come to the University, and there make choice of the special course they

wished to pursue.

   My second complaint is that we teach too many facts. They are not all

important. After three or four years' steady accumulation our men go into the

schools walking dictionaries of chemistry. Parents not unnaturally think that

their sons, after four years of college training, should be fit to take responsible

places wherever chemists are in demand. But manufacturers, as a rule, do not

the men we send out with honours in Chemistry can attack a new problem, can

other hand, prefer a University graduate, for they have in their degree a guarantee

that the student has successfully attacked some unknown problem, and added to

the store of knowledge.

     The influence of science on the nation's industry has been recognised and
insisted on by those who can make their voices heard. The country has at length
awakened to the fact that something is wanting, and cries out for Technical
Instruction. It is not afraid of spending money : indeed, many well-meaning

-- --bodies are spending and in some cases, I fear, wasting money with a prodigal

band. And what, after all, is the great need ? Speaking for the subject I know
best, I say unhesitatingly that we want scientific chemists who can and will make
discoveries : we want men trained, not only in what hns been done, but taught how
to set about winning new knowledge. The Universities, I urge, should teach the

art of research. This is what is wanted, and this, as all experience shows, is what

the Universities can do better than anyone else. And no exorbitant amount of

time need be demanded for this purpose. If the student has learnt the elements of
science at school, three j'ears at most should suffice for the preliminary degree
course. The graduate, armed with the necessary manipulative skill, would then start
research work under proper guidance as the second and more valuable portion of

his University training. And here the new research degree (by whatever name it
may be called) may give us most valuable help. I hope that serious work will be

demanded for it, aud that the research course will become the recognised avenue to

science fellowships and lectureships in the University. Two years would show what
the man had in him. In that time either he would have proved himself no chemist,

<jr he would have made some useful advance in our knowledge, and would have

secured a testimonial of fitness such as no examination could confer. Five years in

-- --all the minimum time now laid down for a medical qualification would surely

be not too much to ask for the chemist's training.
     No extra expense need be incurred to carry out this plan. Some of the college

scholarships at present oSiered on entrance might be reserved for research student-
ships on graduation. These studentships should be the reward of the successful

undergraduate career. On this point, which I have urged for many years, I am

glad to find myself in entire agreement with the President of the Chemical

Society. At Owens College our most successful endowment in Chemistry has
been the Dalton Scholarship, awarded for a research done in the College labora-
tories. In the Victoria University we have lately founded scholarships for the
encouragement of research, which are awarded on the results of the final exami-
nation in the several Honours Schools. The winners are entitled to hold their
scholarships at any university at home or abroad where they can continue their

special studies.

     I plead, then, for greater encouragement of chemical research in Oxford. Make
it part of the normal course of training for everyone who wishes to be a chemist in

fact as well as in name. Consider, not only the country's need, but the value of

 research itself as a mental training, as stimulating and strengthening the activities,
 as creating that sense of devotion and discipleship which becomes the tradition of

 every great school of learning.

   -- --Lastly, let us own that we ourselves the teachers here have been perhaps too

 critical, too much afraid of making mistakes, forgetting that the witty American's

-- --remark that he who never makes mistakes never makes anything has a far

 wider application in science than in politics. Only by practice and drill can we

 learn to collect our strength and swing it with precision into acts. Without that

 training, no matter how much faculty of seeing a man has, ' the step from knowing

 to doing ' is rarely taken. There is nothing, I believe, in O.xford antagonistic to
 our cause. The genius of the place has not declared against scientific research

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

 and if it be a true saying that men here imbibe a liberal education from the very
 air breathed by Locke and Berkeley, surely we also may draw scientific inspiration
 from this air, not only breathed, but first explained by Boyle and Hooke and
 Mavow.

3. On tlie Proportions of Carbonic Acid in Air which are Extinctive to-
    Flame, and tvhich are Irrespirahle. By Frank Clowes, D.Sc, Pro-

     fessor of Chemistry in the University College, Kottingham.

    It is generally maintained that a man cannot breathe air which contains suf-
ficient carbon dioxide to extinguish a candle-flame. Tne correctness of this state-
ment is of great importance to those who have occasion to work in an atmosphere
which may contain large proportions of carbonic acid, such as that in a colliery ob

mine, or in a well-shaft.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       _.
     The careful determination of the proportion of carbonic acid in air which is

just sufficient to extinguish flame has been made by the author, the method adopted
differing essentially from the methods previously employed. Experiments by earlier

investigators had shown very wide discrepancies.
     The author finds that the flames of candles, oil, paraffin, and alcohol are extin-

guished by air containing from 13 to 16 per cent, of carbonic acid. The flame of
coal-gas, however, required the presence of at least 83 per cent, of the extinctive
gas, and the flame of hydrogen was not extinguished until the amount of carbonic

acid in the air reached 58 per cent.
      Taking 15 per cent, of carbonic acid as the proportion in air which is extinctive

of ordinary portable illuminating flames, it is of interest to note that this percentage

of the gas in air appears from the recent experiments of Mr. J. R. Wilson ' to be
quite harmless when breathed. Mr. Wilson found that a rabbit which had
breathed for an hour air containing 25 per cent, of carbonic acid was none the
worse for its experience, but appeared at the end of the hour more lively than at
the beginning. Air containing 60 per cent, of carbonic acid, however, proved fatal
to the rabbit after it had been breathed for a few minutes only. Unfortunately no

intermediate proportions were experimented with.
      It is therefore apparently safe to say that air containing at least 10 per cent,

of carbonic acid more than that required to extinguish a candle-flame can be
breathed with impunity. Probably a much higher proportion of carbonic acid

 than this can be breathed.

     Dr. Angus Smith and many others fully support from experience the statement
that a man can breathe and work in air containing more than sufficient carbonic

 acid to extinguish a flame.

      The extraordinary vitality of the hydrogen-flame in the presence of high propor-

 tions of carbonic acid renders it valuable for maintaining the flame in a miner's safety-

 lamp in foul air. The composite safety-lamp described by the author at the
 Nottingham Meeting of the British Association - serves this purpose well. It can
 burn either an oil-flame or a hydrogen-flame or both together. _When used for

 gas-testing, one of the flames only is used as occasion may require. But it has
 been found that when the lamp runs the risk of being carried into foul air, it is

 most advantageous to burn the hydrogen-flame alongside the illuminating oil-flame.

A comparatively low proportion of carbonic acid extinguishes the oil-flame, and

 this would leave the miner in darkness and without the means of recovering his

 light, since the lamp may not be opened and relighted in the mine. But the

 hydrogen-flame continues burning in the presence of over 50 per cent, of carbonic

acid, and will rekindle the oil-wick after the foul air has been left or passed
through.

     It is worthy of note that the proportion of carbonic acid which was extinctive
of any particular flame was independent of the size of the flame.

     Further, it was noticed that the wick-fed flames gradually diminished in size as
the proportion of carbonic acid in the air was increased ; this was evidently due to
the lowered temperature of the flame leading to a diminished supply of combus-
tible gas or vapour being produced from the combustible solid or liquid ; the flame
ultimately died because it was starved of fuel. The flames of gases fed from jets,
on the other hand, increased in size as the proportion of carbonic acid in the air
was increased. It appeared that the flame extended its surface in the air containino-
a diminished proportion of oxygen, in its endeavour to obtain the supply of oxygen

necessary for its combustion. This expansion of the flame lowered its temperature

ultimately below the kindling point of the gas, and the ilame was therefore extin-
guished by being cooled. The extinctive proportions of carbonic acid for diflferent
flames was therefore determined by the amount of oxygen required for combustion,
and by the extent to which the temperature of the flame in air surpassed the

kindling point of the combustible gas or vapour.

melting at 33°; it is of a high specific gravity (1"35), without odour, hygroscopic

and volatile.

The reason why the free hydroxylamine must he distilled at a low pressure is

that the suhstance is pretty violently explosive, and that explosion occurs sponta-

neously at the temperature of 130°. Thus care must be taken never to heat the

substance too strongly, for if heated at the ordinary pressure to 70° or 80°, an

explosion may occur, the spontaneous decomposition raising the temperature. The

hydroxylamine is an endothermous compound, and can be transformed totally into

gaseous products, the two conditions which, as is known, characterise an explosive.

I have produced an explosion in the following manner : 1 or 1-5 c.c. of the melted

base were put into an ordinary open test-tube, with a thermometer in it ; the tube

stood in an ordinary beaker, which, heated by a burner, acted as an air-bath.

"When the temperature had reached 90°, the flame was withdrawn ; the spontaneous

decomposition was vigorous and the temperature rose to 130.° Then a violent

explosion took place, the glass apparatus was reduced to powder, the copper-gauze

on which the vessel stood was torn to pieces, phenomena which prove that the

explosion is of the same nature as that of high explosives. If one drop of the

melted base in a tube is brought into a flame, a loud explosion is heard.

The free base can burn in the air with a feeble yellowish flame.

That hydroxylamine is a highly reducing agent is known since Lossen, about

thirty years ago, discovered the salts of the base. It is obvious that the free base

must show reducing properties in a much higher degree. On exposure to the air

at the ordinary temperature  it  gradually attracts  oxygen                                        one of  the  products of
                                                                                                ;

the oxidation "is nitrous acid. When the free surface in contact with the air is

--extensive the oxidation is accompanied by a rise of temperature for instance, when
Asome filter paper or asbestos is moistened with the melted substance.
                                                                                                                current

of oxygen passing over the substance gives rise to the formation of fumes containing

nitrous acid, the temperature rising at the same time.

It is not surprising that oxidising agents act violently with the free base ; thus,

for instance, the solid permanganate of potassium, chromic acid, and some peroxides,

in contact with some drops of the substance, produce inflammation. Powdered

bichromate of potassium causes a sharp detonation ; solid iodate of sodium and

nitrate of silver are also reduced instantaneously. The action of anhydrous sul-

phate of copper is also very violent ; the reduction of the salt may be accompanied

by inflammation.
     Metallic sodium also acts violently, producing a flame. If the action is

moderated by adding some dry ether, hydrogen is evolved and a white substance,

NaONH2, is formed. This compound is a dangerous one because it explodes by

contact with the air.
     The halogen acts vehemently with the free base ; chlorine inflames it ; bromine

and iodine disappear immediately, producing the corresponding acids, water, and

nitrous oxide.

    As to the solvent properties of the free base, these are nearly equal to those of

water. It dissolves different salts, some of them, as for instance KI, in great quantity.
Gaseous ammonia, introduced at 16° into the melted base, is dissolved rapidly and

gives a solution containing 20 per cent, of the gas.

     In the same way the substance behaves like water with respec to other

liquids ; it is consequently only easily soluble in the alcohols and nearly insoluble
in the ordinary organic liquids. Methyl and ethyl alcohol are miscible with the
melted base in every proportion ; these solutions, however, below the melting point
of the base are supersaturated with respect to the solid compound. There exists,
however, a difference between liquid hydroxylamine and water, the former not
being miscible in all proportions with propyl alcohol.

     That hydroxylamine can occupy the place of the hydrate water in salts has

beenproved by Crismer, who has prepared the salts ZnClj, 2NH2OH, BaClj, NHoOH,

&c. ; by means of dry ammonia Crismer has prepared the free base irom these

double-compounds.

The presence of the hydroxyl group in hydro-xylamine explains the analogies

between this substance and water; the difference in their behaviour must be
explained, at least partly, by the greater molecular weight of the former.

to keep it cool when adding the soda. This solution is much more liable to oxida-

tion than the free base ; exposed to the air the solution may spontaneouslj' inflame.
So we see that the presence of alkali (or rather of NaONH,,) increases in a hiprh

degree the liability to oxidation, the free base oxidising not so quickly as the solu-

NaOHtion of  in it, while the solid NaONFTj explodes in contact with the air.

Although, as has been shown, free hydroxylaraine is a strong reducing agent,

it can be reduced itself by means of zinc dust. If this substance is moistened with

the base (in an atmosphere of nitrogen), a pretty violent reaction occurs five or ten

minutes later, and ammonia and zinc oxide are formed.

             5. The Chemical Action of a New Bacterium in Milk.
                              By Alexander Bernstein.

    Up to the present time the chemical action of bacteria on sugar has received

the largest share of attention, the alcoholic and acid fermentations offering them-
selves most readily for observation.

     In regard to the efl'ect of bacteria on casein, it has generally been considered as
sufficient to say that some bacteria seem to have a rennet-like action, whilst others
have a peptonising efl'ect. It was assumed that a certain class of bacteria have
the peculiarity of producing an enzj'me which curdles the milk under alkaline
reaction, and afterwards producing another enzyme which dissolves the curd
again. Such actions can be noticed if a milk is strongly heated and then left to

itself.

     The author succeeded in isolating a bacterium, which had such an unusual

effect en sterilised milk, that further studies appeared desirable. These investiga-

tions have been carried on by the author at the Hygienic Institute of Berlin.

     The special bacterium is a very short rod, .scarcely l/x* long and ·5/i in diameter

it shows rapid whirling motion, forms colourless liquid colonies on peptone-

gelatine, which is soon entirely liquefied ; on agar a white slimy growth ; on

potatoes a smooth brown skin. No spores could be observed. The microbe has
received the name Bacterium peptofaciens.

   A practical method of inoculating large quantities of milk with this bacterium

was next described, the object being to obtain a new product out of milk in which
all the casein is in a dissolved state, as it is well known that ordinary milk is not
easily digested by many grown-up persons on account of the undissolved state of

the casein.

Milk which had been deprived of its cream by separators was used for this

purpose. After incubation during eight days at 20° C. the further action of the

bacterium wa.s prevented by heating the milk. This killed the bacteria and caused

Acoagulation of that part of the casein which had not been dissolved.                                                                                                                                                                                 clear

filtrate was obtained : it had a yellow-reddish colour, an aromatic smell, and a taste

reminding one of almonds.

The results of a detailed chemical analysis were given. It was shown that

more than one-half of the casein had been hydrated and formed into albumose and

peptone. The various reactions of the dissolved protein substances were stated.

   A small amount of lactic acid was formed, and a very slight amount of acetic

and butyric acids, these last two together coming only to 'Oo per cent. The bac-

terium does not produce any gaseous products, even after weeks of action.

Sulphuretted hydrogen, indol, and skatol were not formed. The sulphur of the

casein was still contained in the peptone. Ammonia was present in the form of

salts, the amount of ammonia being equal to '07 per cent. Of tyrosin only the

existence could be shown, the amount being too small to show crystals under the

microscope.

     Reference was made to similar products generated during the ripening of
cheese, which is entirely the action of microbes.

     The liquefied milk is slightly concentrated by evaporation, and to the new
product so obtained the name of ' galacton ' has been given. The investigation in
regard to any enzyme being formed by the Bacteriwn peptofaciem gave the result
that this is not the case. As compared to the meat peptones now largely used,

the galacton has the advantage of containing no gluten-peptone, which probably
explains the much better taste ; further, that no chemicals, such as hydrochloric

acid, are required in its preparation.

      Formerly it has been supposed that milk-sugar could only undergo acid

fermentation, but lately special yeasts have been found which produce alcoholic

fermentation of milk-sugar. By means of such yeasts an alcoholic beverage can
be made out of galacton.

     The author concluded with the remark that bacteria have of late been most
conspicuous in the minds of most people by the fact that, out of the enormous
number of bacteria existing, there are a few which have pathogenic effect. But
the action of bacteria in nature is an eminently useful one, and by the chemical
study in this direction we shall learn how to utilise their peculiar action to our

advantage.

   A discussion on the behaviour of gases with regard to their electrification and

the influence of moisture on their combination was opened by the reading of the

three following papers :

1. On the Connection between Chemical Combination and the Discharge of
  Electricity through Gases. By Professor J. J. Thomson, M.A., F.R.S.

     --[This paper was ordered to be printed in extemo. See Keports, p. 482.]

 2. On the Electrification of Molecules and Chemical Change.
                       By H. Brereton Baker.

--[This paper was ordered to be printed in extenso. See Reports, p. 493.]

3. On the Rate of Oxidation of Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Aldehyde.
                       By Thomas Ewan, B.Sc, Ph.D.

     Gaseous oxygen appears sometimes to be more active chemically in the dilute
state than when it is more concentrated. This remarkable behaviour was studied

in the cases of phosphorus, sulphur, and aldehyde, by the author in Professor

van't Hoft"'s laboratory in Amsterdam.

     With phosphorus and oxygen (saturated with aqueous vapour at about 20°) it
was observed that for pressures of'o.vvgen greater than 700 mm. the rate of oxida-
tion was excessively small or nothing at all. Below 700 mm. it increases rapidly.
This limit corresponds with that found by Joubert, below which phosphorescence

begins. After reaching its ma.ximum velocity a very simple relation exists between
the rate of oxidation and the pre.<5sure of the o.xygeu, provided that the change in
the rate of evaporation of the phosphorus, which, according to Stefan, is produced
by_the_ change in the pressure of the oxygen, is taken into account. The rate of
oxidation is then directly proportional to the pressure of the oxygen. In the
absence of water the oxidation also begins suddenly, but at a much lower pressure
(about 200 luui.). Again allowing for the change in the rate of evaporation of the

phosphorus, the velocity of the reaction quickly reaches a maximum and then

decreases, as nearly as could be made out, proportionally to the square root of thrt

pressure of oxygen. The results here were not so certain as might be desired,
owing to the layer of oxide formed on the surface of the phosphojus disturbing

the rea-ular course of the reaction.

    With sulphur in dry oxygen, where the course of the reaction can be con-

veniently followed at 160°, it appears (again allowing for the change in the rate

of evaporation) that the velocity of the reaction is proportional to the square root
of the oxygen pressure.

    No limit was observed here up to 800 mm., beyond which no observations were

made.

    To eliminate the uncertainty introduced by the correction for the rate of evapo-

ration of the phosphorus and sulphur, the reaction between the vapour of acet-
aldehyde and oxygen was studied (at 20°). The reaction was found to go perfectly
regularly, and its velocity was proportional to the product of the pressure of the
aldehyde vapour and of the square root of the pressure of the oxygen gas.

     The interpretation of these facta would appear to be that only that small part
of the oxygen which is broken up into atoms takes part in the oxidation.

4. New Methods of Spectrum Analysin, and on Bessemer Flame Spectra,
                     By Professor W. N. Hartley, F.R.S.

This communication comprises three parts :

-- 1 On the Separation of Spectra of the Alk'tlies from those of the Alkaline Earths.
   This is accomplished by fusing the material with boracic acid, hydrated silica, or

dissolving in hydrofluosilicic acid. The salts so formed are used in the ordinary

manner in a Bunsen flame.

  --2. Methods of obtaining Spectra with Flames at High Temperatures. The diffi-

cultv of obtaining spectra at high temperatures arises from the necessity of having a

support for the substances to be examined which is practically infusible in the oxy-

hydrogen flame. The mineral kyanite from County Donegal is suitable for supports

Ain the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe flame.  commoner material is ordinary tobacco-

pipe, which serves as a support for various metallic salts. The spectra obtained in

the oxy-hydrogen flame have the following characters, by which they may be

classitied :

(1) Lines : lithium, thallium, nickel, cobalt.

(2) Bands : antimony, bismuth, gold, tin, sulphur, selenium.
(3) Bands and lines together: copper, iron, manganese, tellurium, lead, and

            silver.

(4) More or less continuous spectra with lines: sodium, potassium, magnesium,
          chromium, cadmium.

(Ti) Continuous spectra : zinc, carbon, arsenic.

(G) No spectrum : platinum.

    Band spectra can be converted into line spectra by reducing the quantity cf
substance in the flame. This is shown by the lines of silver which are found to be

present in spectra obtained from ordinary copper ; the spectrum of silver being

Aitself a band spectrum.              distinct flame spectrum may be emitted by compounds

at high temperatures. Examples of such spectra are those of magnesia, lime,

copper-oxide. Some compounds emit only the spectra of the metals they contain;

such are compounds of iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, sodium, potas-

sium, lithium, thallium, and rubidium.

   --3. Bessemer Flame Spectra. Up to the present time the precise nature of the

spectrum, the cause of its production, its sudden disappearance when decarburisa-

tion of the metal takes plare, and the connection between the decarburisation of

the metal and the extinction of the spectrum, have not been satisfactorily explained.

According to Roscoe, Lielegg, Kupelwieser, and Spear Parker, the spectrum is
characterised by bands of carbon or of carbon monoxide, which disappear when all

carbon is burnt out of the metal.

    On the other hand, according to the investigations of Simmler, Brunner, von

Lichtenfels, and Wedding, tlie spectrum is not due to carbon (Roscoe), or to car-

bon monoxide (Lielegg and Kupelwieser), but to manganese and other elements in

the pig-iron.

The very careful examination of these spectra by Watts, and his comparison of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.         61 i

them with that of the Bessemer flame, led to the conclusion that it was not the
spectrum of carbon in any form, or of manaranese, but that of manganic oxide.

     The spectrum is a complex one, which exhibits differences in constitution
during different periods of the ' blow,' and even during different intervals in the
same period. As originally observed by Watts, the spectrum differs in different
works, the difference being due to temperature and to the composition of the

metal blown.

   --During the First Period. The lines of the alkali metals, sodium, potassium,

and lithium, are seen unreversed on a bright, continuous spectrum caused by

carbon monoxide. The C line of hydrogen, and apparently the F line, were seen
reversed during a snowstorm, when much moisture entered the metal with the

blast.

   --During the Second Period, the ' Boil.' Bands of manganese are prominent,

overlying the continuous spectrum of carbon monoxide. There are lines of carbon

monoxide, manganese, and iron, also those of the alkaline metals.

   --During the Third Period, the ' Fining Stage.' The spectrum is the same as the

foregoing, but the lines of iron are not so strong and not quite so well defined.

Some of the short lines of iron disappear; the lines of the alkali metals are

visible.

     The alkali metals do not show themselves in the Bessemer flame until a layer
of slag has been formed and the temperature has risen sufliciently high for these
basic constituents to be vaporised. At the temperature of the ' boil,' or second
period, both metallic manganese and iron are freely vaporised in a current of
carbon monoxide which rushes out of the bath of molten metal. The evidence of
this is the large number of bands of manganese and lines of iron in the spectrum.

    When the metal blown contains but little manganese, the manganese spectrum

in the flame does not arise from that substance being contained in the bath of
metal ; it must be vaporised from the slag. That this is so has been proved by
photographs of the spectrum from samples of slag obtained from the Crewe works.

This explains the fact observed by Brunner, namely, that when a converter is

being heated with coke after it has been used, but not relined, the spectrum of the
Bessemer flame makes its appearance ; manifestly it comes from the adhering slag.

     The luminosity of the flame during the ' boil ' is due, not merely to the com-

bustion of highly heated carbonic oxide, but also to the presence of the vapours of
iron and manganese in the gas.

     The disappearance of the manganese spectrum at the end of the ' fining stage,'
or third period, is primarily due to a reduction in the quantity of the heated
carbon mono.xide escaping from the converter, which arises from the diminished

quantity of carbon in the metal. When the last traces of carbon are gone, so that

air may escape tlirougli the metal, the blast instantly oxidises any manganese

either in the metal or in the atmosphere of the converter, and furthermore oxidises
some of the iron. The temperature must then fall with great rapidity.

     The entire spectroscopic phenomena of the ' blow ' are undoubtedly determined
by the chemical composition of the molten iron, and of the gases and metallic
vapours within the converter, the temperature of the metal, and that of the

issuing gases.

   --The Temperature of the Besiemer Flame. Tlie probable temperature of the
--Bessemer flame at the finish is that produced by the combustion in cold air of

carbonic oxide heated to about 1,580° C. that is to say, to the temperature which,
according to Le Ohatelier,' is that of the bath of molten metal from which the gas

has proceeded.

                     5. On the Chemistry of Coal Formation.
                        By J. W. Thomas, F.I.C, F.C.S.

    The age of the coal, and the physical conditions, such as the effect of water,
heat, and pressure, should throw light upon the chemistry of coal formation ; but

the coals in one ' field ' are found under different physical and chemical conditions

from those of another, and little evidence is obtained by comparison.
     The decomposition of peat and of wood teaches us more of the chemistry

of coal formation. In both instances the woody fibre disappears first, leaving a

residue richer in resinoids. The lignites of Bovey Tracey have, as in the case of

decaying peat and wood, an excess of resinoid matters over the vegetation which

formed them. Hutton found mineral resin in Carboniferous coals, and others since.

Witham showed long ago, and much recent evidence proves, that conifers and

other dicotyledons flourished during the Carboniferous period. Just as lime and

other trees shed saccharine matter on the leaves and grass underneath, so it is

probable that liquid, gummy, and resinous matters were showered from the forest

vegetation during the Carboniferous and Tertiary periods.

The chemical changes in coal formation took place chiefly at and near the

surface. In the formation of paraffin shale and some Scotch cannels the woody

fibre of the forest growths was destroyed, little else but bituminous matters remain-

Aing.  resinous vegetation without much dicotyledonous trees, or if with dicotyle-

dons, considerable surface exposure and decomposition of the woody fibre, would

produce rich bituminous coal, Wigan cannel, &c. A. luxuriant resinous and
dicotyledonous vegetation, assisted by heat and pressure, without much surface

decomposition, probably gave rise to semi-bituminous, steam, and anthracite coal.

Our present chemical knowledge of coal may be summed up as follows:--

1. It contains water after air-drying. The hygroscopicity of coal has not

received due attention. The water "is in chemical combination. Further, the

hygroscopicity is most probably the key to the spontaneous combustion of coal.

2. Coal contains the gases,"liquid?, and solids of the parafiin series, but these

tot'ether will not make up more than 1 per cent, of Carboniferous coals.

"3. The bulk of coal is carbon, with more or less hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,

Wesulphur, and ash.  shall probably never know how the carbon is combined or

bow much is in the free state.

Further experiments are suggested as follows :

1. Upon the decomposition of dicotyledons to throw light upon the formation

of coal.

     2. Upon the hygroscopicity of coal ; and to study its bearings upon the

spontaneous combustion of coal on board ship.

     3. Upon coals from all Briti.sh coal-fields, to determine the quantity and, if

possible, the constituents soluble in gasolene (petroleum ether) or benzine a»

employed by Mr. Watson Smith.
     4. To act upon the various coals with a weak solution of potassic hydrate.

6. On the Iodine Value of Sunlight in the High Alps. By Dr. S. Rideal:

     At the meeting of the A^ociation in Nottingham I had an opportunity of sub-

mitting the values of the sunlight in the Upper Engadine in terms of the amount
of iodine liberated from an acidulated solution of potassium iodide during th©
month of January 1893. These experiments have been continued during the

months of January and February of the present year by my brother, A. W. Rideal,

and the results may therefore not be without interest. The recent experiments
were conducted in exactly the same way as those of last year, so that in all respects

they are strictly comparable.

     The solutions were standardised by standard iodine solution prepared in
England, and the hvposulphite solution was checked against this solution from

time to time during the progress of the experiments.

     During the last winter the weather was, on the whole, bad, and the number of
days on which snow fell or which were overcast were more numerous than in the

corresponding period of last year.

    The maximum value was obtained on February 4, and was equal to 1452 mgms.
of iodine per 100 c.c, as compared with 13-5, the maximum value on January 1,
1893. The lowest value was 3-53 on December 9, 1893, as against 5*7 on
      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  613

January 24 of last season. The number of bad days on which little or no sun was
recorded lowers the average for the period under examination. It amounts to
7'05 mgms. per hour, whilst in January 1893, taking only the bright days, the
quantity was 9'34.

     I understand that the ordinary meteorological record was kept as usual, and
that the data are to be found in the ' Alpine Post ' for the days on which these
experiments were carried out. I append, however, a brief note as to the atmo-
spheric conditions in a separate column.

4. On the Relations between the Viscosity of Liquids and their Chemical
       Nature.^ By Dr. T. E. Thorpe, F.R.S., and J. W. Eodger.

     During the past four years the authors have been making observations on the
viscosity of liquids with the view of establishing relationships between this property
on the one hand and molecular weight and molecular structure on the other. They
have employed the tube-method of measuring the viscosity coefficieut, and in the
case of each liquid the observations extend over the temperature range between 0°
and the ordinary boiling-point. More than eighty liquids have now been

examined.

     For liquids which do not appear to contain molecular aggregates, at any tem-

perature, the following conclusions may be drawn :

     1. In homologous series the viscosity coefficient is greater the greater the mole-

cular weight.

     2. The coefficient of a normal compound is greater than that of the isomeric

iso-compound.

     3. The coefficient of an allvl compound is intermediate to those of the corre-
sponding normal propyl and "iso-propyl compounds, and, in general, constitution

exerts a regular eft'ect on the viscosity coefficient.
     Liquids which appear to contain complex molecules in certain cases do not obey

these rules. Formic and acetic acids are exceptions to Rule 1. The alcohols do
not conform to Rules 2 and 3. In general, the effect of temperature upon viscosity

is much greater for complex than for simple liquids. In both classes of liquids the
behaviour of the initial members of several homologous series does not accord wjth

that of higher homologues.

In attempting to quantitatively connect viscosity with chemical nature, the

authors have used two magnitudes--the molecular viscosity and the molecular vis-

--cosity-work which may be derived from the viscosity coefficient. If »/ be the

viscosity coefficient and v be the molecular volume, the molecular viscosity is t/I'S,

or the product of j; and the molecular area. The molecular viscosity-work is jjy,

the product of r] and the molecular volume. The values of these rnagnitudes

have been examined at three different series of temperatures of comparison--viz.,

the ordinary boiling-points, the corresponding temperatures of 0°-6, and tempera-

tures of equal slope or points on the viscosity curves at which temperature is

exercising the same effect upon the viscosity of each liquid. On ascribing

--definite partial values to the atoms and the diiierent modes of atom-linkage the
--iso-grouping, double linkage, the ring-grouping, &c. it has been found possible to

calculate the viscosity magnitudes of the great majority of the simple liquids.

The results obtained at equal slope are by far the most precise, but even here the

alcohols, water, and, to a less extent, the acids are anomalous, doubtless on account

Aof the influence of molecular complexity.  strong point in favour of the new-

method of using equal slope as a condition of comparison is that the stoichiometric

relationsliips obtained at any one value of the slope appear to be general, and thus

to be independent of the particular value of the slope at which the comparisons

ai"e made. This conclusion applies even to complex liquids like water and the acids,

but not to the alcohols, which of all the liquids examined exhibit, at all of the

systems of comparison, the most exceptional behaviour.

     5. Some Experiments on the Hate of Progress of Chepiical Change,

                         By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S.

     In the last February number of the ' Philosophical Magazine ' Mr. VWey

pointed out four stages of a chemical reaction: 'First, the commencement; second,

the  period  of  inertness  or  reluctance,  followed  by acceleration  ;  third,  of constancy
                                                                                                                                              ;

fourth, of diminution of velocity.' This reminded the author of various old

experiments which had never been published, and he returned to the subject with

a view of seeing whether this period of inertness followed by acceleration occurred

in such simple cases as that of reciprocal decomposition of salts, and whether,

where it did occur, it was capable of any explanation on known principles. The

reciprocal decomposition of potassio-platinum-chloride and potassium-iodide slowly

produces the iodine salt which makes itself manifest by its deep red colour. In

examining this in various ways the action always appeared most rapid at first and

gradually slackened till a balance of the salts in solution was obtained. In such

cases, on the contrary, as that of the lormation of bitartrate of potassium or

calcium, where a larger amount of the products is foi'med than can be kept in

solution, it is some time before crystals make their appearance, and then they come

with a rush, gradually diminishing to the end of the reaction. This seems to be

due partly to the phenomenon of super-saturation and partly to the necessity of

rapid redistribution of the acids and bases when the bitartrate produced is thrown

out of the field of action and reaction. In cases where almost insoluble salts are

formed, such as strontium sulphate, the liquid becomes milky almost at once, a

constant redistribution being necessitated by the separation of the insoluble salt,

and the curves representing the course of the action closely resembled those of the

platinum salt given above.

     There are unquestionably many cases in which there is very little appearance

of action at first, but afterwards it comes on rapidly, and then, of course, diminishes.

The formation of zinc-methyl was quoted, but a more interesting instance was the

reaction between cuprous oxide and silver nitrate in rather weak solution. At

first little or nothing is seen ; after a while long filaments of metallic silver shoot

forth, the reaction becoming very rapid, until the silver solution is very much
weakened, when, of course, it proceeds more slowly. In explanation of this we
may conceive of some possible 'induction,' or charging up of the metallic oxide, or

the influence of the local rise of temperature, or the greater scope for voltaic action

between the growing silver and the copper compound. The author, however, did

not insist on any particular explanation, but gave the facts as a contribution to the

general subject.

6. The Determining of the Freezing -jwint of Water, van't ffoff's Constant,

    Arrhenius' Laio of Dissociation, Osticald's Law of Dilution. By Dr.
     Mejer Wildermann.

      I have already given an account, in the Physical Section, of the method

 devised, in concert with the late P. B. Lewis, for accurately determining the
freezing-point of aqueous solutions which freeze at temperatures just below 0° C.

      The depression of the freezing-point of a solution of any concentration is stated
 in degrees below the freezing-point of water. The freezing-point of water and of
 extremely dilute solutions is very difficult to determine with accuracy. Under

 ordinary circumstances a cap of ice forms round the bulb of the thermometer ; if

the formation of this cap is prevented, the freezing-point of water determined by my

thermometer divided to 0°001 is higher by 0°-0015 to 0°-0017 than when the cap

 exists and a constant error in the determination of the freezing-point is not removed.
      The method of determining the freezing-point of very dilute solutions which

was devised by my late friend P. B. Lewis, and my investigations of the freezing-

point of water, and of extremely dilute solutions, give us a means of submitting
van't Hoft's constant, Arrhenius' law of dissociation, and Ostwald's law of dilution
to a more accurate verification.

     It is well known that it was van't Hofl" who first drew attention to the fact
that the equations representing the generalisations arrived at by Boyle, Gay Lussac,
TRANSACTIONS OK SECTION B.                             617

and Avogadro in the case of gases are equally applicable to dissolved substances if

the osmotic pressure of the dissolved molecules be substituted for the pressure

of the gas.

     While van't Hoff was able to establish a thermodynamic relation between the
csraotic pressure of a dissolved substance aud the molecular lowering of vapour

pressure, the molecular lowering of the freezing-point of solutions furnishes a

rational basis for the empirical generalisations of Raoult, and of Babo and WLillner.
     In van"t Hoff's thermodynamical argument the solutions are assumed to be

very dilute, and Leuce experimental veritication is specially important for the case

of such solutions.
     I have found that in the case of aqueous solutions of sugar and urea the agree-

ment between the value calculated by van't Hoff by means of the equation

^J^^ W Wt = (which must equal 1-89 if = 79 kal., and is 1-87 if = 80 kal.) and

the observed value of the constant is excellent. Even in the case of alcohol the

--values do not vary by more than \h per cent, from 1"87 a difference which may

be accounted for by the difficulty of determining exactly the percentage of alcohol

in a solution from its density. That this is the case is shown by the fact that the

value 1 '84 or 1 85 is observed for all concentrations. It is also possible to calculate

van't Hoff's constant without determining the freezing-point of water in the

following way : Sugar, urea, and alcohol are not electrolytes, i.e., are in water only

Wevery slightly dissociated.  can, therefore, determine the relation between con-

centration and depression of freezing-point, starting from a solution of any conA'enient

concentration, where an ice cap is not formed, instead of from pure water, and thus

eliminate the influence of any error in the determination of the freezing-point of

water. From these observations made with my thermometers divided to 0°'01

and 0°-001 I have been able to establish van't Hoff's constant by a second inde-

pendent method. Also, if the results obtained by Loomis with a thermometer read-

ing to 0°01 are similarly treated, the van't Hoff's constant becomes evident in the

case of sugar, less evident in the case of water and alcohol, though the variations

are so great that the probable error is greater than he suspected, and the concentra-

tion of the solution was probably wrongly determined.

   We proceed to the generalisation of Arrhenius. Yan't Hoff showed by four

different methods that a law analogous to that of Avogadro was valid for solution

of non-electrolytes like cane-sugar. It then became of importance to account for

exceptional cases in which the depression of the freezing-point was abnormal, and

in particular the cases of salts, acids, and bases in aqueous solutions. The explana-

tion was given when Arrhenius showed that by two independent, quite different

methods, the observation of the lowering of the freezing-point and of the electrical

conductivity of a solution, the same value could be obtained for the factor i, which

denotes the ratio of the pressure actually exerted by the substance to the pressure

which the substance would exert if it consisted entirely of undissociated molecules.

This law, which is of special importance owing to the light thrown by the

dissociation-theory on various physical and chemical problems, must, like those

of van't Hoff already mentioned, be more valid in very dilute solutions, and

should at first be verified for them. For sugar, urea, alcohol, which are bad con-

ductors of electricity, we have found normal depression and a constant 1'89 or

1-87. For KCl, SO^H.,, dichloracetic acid, trichloracetic acid, and nitrobenzoic

acid, which are good conductors and show at the same time abnormal depression,

I found that the degrees of the dissociation from the lowering of freezing-point and

from the electrical conductivity are nearly the same.

It is obviously desirable "that Ostwald's dilution law, one of the laws of the

action of masses, and a most important foundation for the theory of dissociation,

should be verified by determinations of freezing-points, just as it has been verified

by determinations of electrical conductivity ; and for the reasons already stated the
experimental verification is most important in the case of the most dilute solutions.

The effect of experimental error in the calculation is here very considerable, and the

freezing point methods hitherto in use have not been sufficiently delicate to verify

the dilution law. The more accurate method already referred to has to a large

7. On the Effect of Dilution upon the Colours of Salt Solutions and the
        Measurement of this Effect. By Wyatt W. Randall, Fh.D.

The writer called attention to the conclusions deduced by Ostwald from the

hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation with regard to the source of the colour of

salt solutions, and to the work of Knoblauch, Kriiss, Traube, Arrhenius, Magna-

nini, Ostwald, Wagner, and others upon this subject. The experiments "and

conclusions of Vernon were then more particularly discussed, to show the
Ainaccuracy which the author believes characterised them.
                                                                                                                                       drawing was then
shown of an apparatus, through the use of which the author hopes to be able to

determine with comparative accuracy the effect of dilution upon the colours of

salt solution. Since, according to the theory of electrolytic dissociation, the

colour of a salt solution is due to the presence in it of free coloured ions, it follows

that with increased dissociation the colour must become proportionally more

intense. One of the simplest ways to produce more complete dissociation is by

dilution. Hence a dilute solution, ceteris paribus, should, in proportion to the
amount of salt contained, show a more intense colour than a concentrated one.

In the apparatus shown the author examines the relative length of column of

coloured solutions of different concentrations which show the same intensity of

colour, in order to determine whether or not the colour remains proportional to

the concentration. Several advantages claimed for the apparatus were pointed

put. It is, for example, so arranged that the light transmitted through the

stronger solution also passes through a column of water equal in length to the

difference between the lengths of column of the concentrated and the dilute

solutions. By this means any error due to the colour, &c., of the water of the

solutions is presumably eliminated. The tubes through which the light is trans-

mitted are silver-plated, and the measurements are made in a dark room, in order

that all error due to diffused light may be removed.

The results, so far as they have gone, indicate that the colour remains practi-

cally proportional to the concentration, whereas in the solutions examined the

dissociation varied in amount from about 25 per cent, to nearly 60 per cent. The

author, however, desires his results thus far to be considered as merely preliminary.

The behaviour of one solution examined suggests that the effect produced upon

the colour by varying the rate of dilution, which Vernon claims to have noticed

in the case of certain compounds of chromium, may be much more general than

that investigator imagined. This point will in the future receive special

attention.

            8. On the Distinction between Mixtures and Compounds,
                                By P. J. Hartog, B.Sc.

The distinction between mixtures and compounds, as it is now understood,

dates from the controversy between Berthollet and Proust at the beginning of the

century. Most text-books state that Proust showed that ' the same compound

always contains the same elements united in the same proportions,' and imply that

the statement does not hold good for ' the same mixture.' Interpreted literally,

the statement is a mere truism, and applies equally to both classes of substances. By

altering its form somewhat we are led to the postulate : ' Substances in other

respects 'alike posse.«s the same quantitative composition '--a postulate daily made

use of in the laboratory, though it is not to be found in the text-books. This

postulate was tacitly accepted by Berthollet as well as Proust, and has nothing to

do with     the  distinction sought for                                                                                      we  see,  therefore, that the points at issue

between the two men have teen misrepresented. The author has shown else-
where ' how this misrepresentation has arisen. Proust was unable to furnish the
experimental distinction between compounds and mixtures which Berthollet

demanded again and again ; nor until lately has it been possible to establish one.

It is possible that such a one may be based on the recent work of Raoult, who has

shown that the melting-point of a pure compound is always lowered and its
boiling-point raised by the ad'dition of a small quantity of some dissimilar sub-

stance. But it is important to realise that a satisfactory experimental distinction

is still a desideratum, and that the only definition that we can give of a compound

to distinguish it from a mixture is a theoretical one based on the consideration of

molecules.

9. The Atomic Weight of Carbon.- By Professor J. A. Wanklyn.

Members of this Section who, like myself, a third of a century ago were at

that time charged with the responsibility of teaching chemistry to the students of a

University will have a lively recollection of the incidents attendant on the change
of notation at that period. The controversies of that day evolved, as will be
remembered, a short and easy method of arriving at the molecular weight of a

chemical substance, and likewise a short and easy method of finding the atomic

weight of an element.

In Kekule's words, very slightly modified, these methods were as follows :

' Defining standard volume (or, as it was called, the standard two volumes) as

that vobime which is occupied by two grammes of hydrogen at a given suitable
temperature and pressure, we were told that, if we would know the molecular
weight of any chemical substance, we must ascertain how many grammes of the

substance were required to fill the standard volume with the vapour of the sub-

stance, and that that number was the molecular weight. And the atomic weight

of an element was to be foimd by observing what was the very least quantity of
that element ever entering into the standard volume tilled with a compound

of that element.'

    Having laid down the law much in that style, advocates of the new notation
forthwith proceeded to make the practical application by noting that the least

number of grammes of carbon ever occurring in the standard volume of any

--carbon compound was 12 w^o, the atomic weight of carbon is 12.

     It was at the same time incidentally noted that in all those cases where more

than 12 grammes of carbon was found in the standard volume, the number was

either 24 or 36, or some other multiple of 12. And so the matter has rested until

the present day.

I have now to announce that, as the result of most laborious investigation

mycarried on conjointly with  friend and colleague, Mr. Cooper, there exists a

multitude of carbon compounds wherein the quantity of carbon in the standard

volume is not a multiple of 12, but is a multiple of G. And the consequence

follows that the atomic weight of carbon is 6, as was commonly believed by

chemists a third of a century ago.

     The method consists in determining the time required to precipitate the lime in
dilute lime water containing an insulficient quantity of lime to unite with all the
COj present.

     Phenolphthalein is used as indicator, and the end of the reaction is determined
by noting the point at which the liquid becomes decolourised.

11. On the Diffusion of very Dilute Solutions of Chlorine and Iodine.
                                   By A. P. Laurie.

                             TUESDAY, AUGUST 14,

    The following Papers and Report were read :

       1. Investigations on Tatitomerism. By Professor W. J. Bruhl.

           2. On Ortho-dinitroso Derivatives of the Aroniatic Series.
                  By Professor E. Noelting, Mulhouse, Alsace.

     In a paper jointly published about two years ago by Messrs. Grandmougin,
Michel, and myself, the fact has been mentioned that ortho-nitrodiazobenzeneimide,
upon being heated with water or distilled with steam, evolved nitrogen, and that
finally a new body fusing at 70°-71° was produced.

   A recent investigation of that body, undertaken in collaboration with Dr.

Karl Kohn, has proved its composition to agree with the formula CgH^N.^Oo, and
the determination of its molecular weight gave numbers corresponding to this
simplest formula and not to that of a polymere.

     The action of reducing agents resulted in the formation of ortho-phenylene-

diamine.

     These facts render it probable that the new body is ortho-dinitroso-benzene, a
para-isomere of which had already been made known by Nietzki. It was produced
by the oxidation of para-quinone-dioxime. The analogous oxidation of ortho-

naphto-quinone-dioxime into the corresponding ortho-dinitroso-compound has,

eome time before Nietzki, been carried out by Ilinski. This oxidation is rendered
evident by the following formula :

Ortho-Bitrodiazobenzeneimide                                 Ortho-dinitrosobenzene

   A convenient method of obtaining dinitroso derivatives from the corresponding

ortho-diazoimides consists in heating the latter in a solution of glycerine at tempera-

tures ranging from about 100° to 120°. When the evolution of nitrogen has

ceased, water is to be added and the nitroso-compound thus precipitated is filtered

off. By crystallisation from boiling alcohol it may be easily obtained in a state of

perfect purity.

     Ortho-dinitrosobenzene crystallises from its aqueous solution in needle-shaped
crystals, from alcohol in plates, fusing at 70°-71°. It is sparingly soluble in water,
easily in alcohol, ether, &c.

    It sublimes readily, and maybe volatilised in a current of steam. The odour of

its vapour is slightly irritating, and resembles in a dilate state that of nitrobenzene.

By G. G. Henderson, D.Sc, M.A., and A. R. Ewing, Ph.D.

     Arsenious oxide dissolves readily in a boiling solution of sodium hydro-
gen tartrate, and on concentration and cooling a compound of the formula
C4H40gA.80Na. 2A Aq. crystallises out in aggregates of needles or prisms. The salt

is quite stable when dry, and may even be heated for several hours at 185° without

undergoing further change than loss of water of crystallisation. It has a sweetish,
not unpleasant taste, and is easily soluble in water, but it appears to be decomposed
slightly by a large excess of water. It crystallises from dilute alcohol in colourless

plates.

     The corresponding ammonium salt, C^HjOeAsONlI^. | Aq., which is prepared

in a similar way, crystallises in small glistening needles which are easily soluble
in water. The crystals effloresce slowly, and appear to undergo partial decompo-
sition on standing for some time.

     The potassium salt is not so easily prepared, owing to its instability in aqueous
solution. It is obtained by addiug arsenious oxide to a boiling concentrated solu-

tion of potassium hydrogen tartrate so long as it dissolves, filtering, cooling the
filtrate, and then adding two volumes of alcohol to it. The white, finely crystalline
precipitate which is formed is washed with alcohol and dried on a porous plate.
Analysis of this compound gave results agreeing fairly well with the formula

C^H^OgAsOK. Aq. When the salt is treated with water, even in the cold, it
decomposes into arsenious oxide and potassium hydrogen tartrate, but it may be

recrystallised from dilute alcohol, from which it separates in long needles. Slight

decomposition occurs in this case also.

    When a dilute solution of barium chloride is mixed with a dilute solution of

the sodium salt, delicate glistening needles of the barium salt are gradually formed.
It has the formula (C^H40gAsO)2Ba. Aq.,and is only slightly soluble in hot water.

It is decomposed to some extent by boiling with much water. The corresponding
strontium and calcium salts are obtained in a similar way, but the mixed solutions
are boiled for a short time. They crystallise in small shining cubes, apparently
isomorphous, and are more soluble than the barium salt. Other compounds of this

series have not yet been prepared.

All of the compounds described above are decomposed by excess of mineral

acids, with liberation of arsenious oxide. If, however, the salt is kept in excess, a

substance is obtained in solution which has the properties of an acid, but which

has not been isolated owing to its instability. When the barium salt, suspended

in water, is decomposed by sulphuric acid (taking care to keep the salt in excess),

barium sulphate is precipitated and a clear solution is obtained, which remains

unaltered even after standing for several weeks. The solution has a strong acid

reaction, but contains no free sulphuric acid, and with hydrogen sulphide it gives a

copious precipitate of arsenious acid. If heated, or allowed to evaporate spon-

taneously over sulphuric acid, or mixed with alcohol, it is decomposed into

arsenious oxide, which precipitates, and tartaric acid, which remains in solution.

It undergoes the some change at once if a drop or two of a mineral acid is added.

It decomposes the carbonates of the alkalies and of the alkaline earths, carbon
Adioxide being evolved, and the salts described above being formed.
                                                                                                                    quantitative

examination of the solution showed that it contained exactly the quantity of

arsenic required on the assumption that a substance of the formula AsO^HjO,^ was.

present. It may be concluded, therefore, that there is a definite compound of thin

composition in the solution, and that it is stable at ordinary temperatures if tho

solution be not too concentrated. Taking its properties into account, this substance

may be regarded as a tartrarsenious acid ^s(^r\\r * ^, i-e-, as a derivative of the

hypothetical rrthoarseniousacid As(0H)3, and the compounds described above may

be considered to be the salts of tartrarsenious acid, or the tartrarsenites.
     Arsenic acid and various acid oxides likewise appear to forni definite compounds

when treated with the acid alkaline salts not only of tartaric acid but also of other
organic oxyacids, but the investigation of this subject has not proceeded, far enough

to justify the publication of results.

6. On the Constitution of the Acid Amides.
 By J. B. Cohen, Ph.D., Yorkshire College.

--Formation of the Acid Amiden. These compounds are usually obtained by

three methods, to which the following equations are assigned :

1. R or H . NHj + R or H . CO^H = R or H . NH . CO . R or H + HjO
2. RorH.NHj + R.COCI               = R or H . NH . CO . R
                                                                                                                                                +HC1
3. R or H . NH2+ R or H . CO,R = R or H . NH . CO . R or H + R . OH

     In 2 and 3 the mode of formation would point to the following constitution for
the acid amides, which until recently has been generally accepted

     Evidence upon which the choice of formula of the acid amide itself rests is of a
very unsatisfactory kind.

    The action of cone. HCl, cone. NaOH, PC1,, P.p.,, or Br would satisfy either

formula.

     One reaction appears definitely in favour of the carbonyl formula, whereas there
are two which point equally distinctly to the hydro.vyl formula.

    Caustic soda and sodium ethylate unite with a few acid amides to form Na
derivatives, in which the Na may be replaced by an alkyl group by the action of
alkyl iodide, and yields a compound in which the new group is undoubtedly attached

Nto the atom.

    On the other hand, many aftid atnideS unite with silver oxide to form silver

Hcompounds in which one atom of is replaced by Ag, and these bodies treated

with alkyl iodide yield the isomeric imido-ethers.

    Beckmann's reaction, which Consists in a molecular change produced by PCL

and other reagents on ketoximes forming isomeric acid amides, points at least to the
intermediate formation of a compound of the hydroxyl formula.

    Since working on the aroma-tic amides it has frequently struck me as curious

--that of the series fcrmanilide, acetanilide, &c., including benzanilide and oxanilide,

the first formanilide-- should possess chemical and physical properties so totally
ditferent from the others of the series.

     Formanilide crystallises in long prisms from alcohol, whereas the others, includ-
ing benzanilide, form glistening plates all so similar in appearance that it would be
impossible to identify them by their exterior alone. Formanilide, of which the

formula is usually written CgH^NH . COH, yields with NaOH and Ag,,0, Na and
Ag compounds, which none other of the series do. This evidently points to a

fundamental diilerence in constitution.

    Recent Viexos on the Constitution of the Acid Amides.--ThM and Enoch showed

that the Ag compound of benzamide differs from the Na compound by the fact

and Comstock shortly afterwards showed that similar reactions occurred in the
case of formanilide. Fovmanilide was therefore regarded as an example of tauto-
merism ; a view which is now generally held in regard to the constitution of the

acid amides.

    Leaving for the present the consideration of the Na compounds of the amides,

I will take the larger class of acid amides in which an atom of hydrogen is

replaceable by an atom of Ag.

prepare pure Na acetanilide, one experiment gave an unexpected result, and it
appears to me not only to bear out the above view of the constitution of these

      If acetanilide is dissolved in dry ether, and one molecule of solid sodium

C,iIjN.C(OH)CH3.CH30Na separates out in needles. The two molecules are

very loosely attached, and the acetanilide may be easily dissolved out from the
other substance. The formation of this compound points to the following

      1. Acetanilide is an unsaturated compound.
     2. The formation of the sodium compounds in the case of anti compounds is
preceded by the formation of addition compounds, with subsequent loss of one

guished

      (1) Solutions of a single salt.

     (2) Solutions with two or more salts, all of which contain the same acid
or basic radical, and form neither double sails nor isomorphous mixtures,

    Two(3) salts that are in a condition to f'orui a double salt.

     (4) So-called ' reciprocal ' salts, i.e., salts which can be formed from two acid'J

result by evaporation, and an account of new experiments with NII^Cl + NaNO^

in the paper is recommended in respect to many technical processes, and ther

formation of natural salts.

5. On some Derivatives of Camphene. By J. E. Marsh and J. A. Gardner.

                  6. On Fluorene Diacetate.
By Professor W. R. Hodgkinson and A. H. Coote.

In some previous communications to the Chemical Society by one of us, halogen

and other derivatives of fluorene have been described. With the exception of*

diphenylenketone, there is no derivative in which it is for certain knovsTi that the

methylenic hydrogen is replaced. "When solutions of fluorene, dibenzyl or ace-

naphtene are acted upon by chlorine, bromine, &c., substitution invariably takes

place in the benzenoid nucleus.

From the results of some experiments made by one of us on the sulphonates of

fluorene and acenaphtene dissolved in strong H.^SO^, it appeared probable that dry

chlorine might act upon these hj'drocarbons in the absence of a solvent, and perhaps

at some high temperature in a similar manner to its action on toluene, &c.

Experiment proved this to be the case.

The hydrocarbons were dried and treated with very dry chlorine at the ordinary

room temperature, and also at or about the boiling-point of the respective hydro-

carbons. Action commenced immediately, and a tendency was noticed for the

chloride produced to distil over in the current of chlorine.

The action is, however, not quite confined to the methylenic hydrogen, for the

chlorides first produced act as solvents for the still uuacted-upon fluorene or

acenaphtene, and some substitution in the benzene nucleus takes place. The

amount of this can he reduced by letting the chlorine act rapidly.

By careful distillation under reduced pressure it is possible to effect a partial

Aseparation.  better jilan is to dissolve in absolute alcohol, and fractionally

crystallise by cooling with a C0,, alcohol bath.

From fluorene the following bodies appear to be produced :

               I.               If.                III.               IV.

     Acenaphtene is converted almost entirely into a dichloride. None of the

chlorinated fluorene products gives diphenylenketone when oxidised under the

same conditions as produce diphenylenketone from fluorene.

    One fraction of the chlorinated fluorene which distilled under about 300 mm. at

320° to 330° C. gave 29°-52 per cent. CI ; the calculated amount for G^^llfil is

30-23 per cent.

   A diacetate was prepared from this by digesting with alcoholic potavssium

--acetate. On analysis this gave 71'23 per cent, carbon and 3'92 hydrogen C,3Hg.

(CH3COo).3 requires 72-3 C and 4-9 H. This product boiled at 326° to 330° O. at
760 mm. pressure.
630 REPORT-- 1894.

   A large quantity of the crude clilorination product was digested with acetate.

From the result several bodies have been separated by fractional distillation, a
comparatively easy process, since the acetates are much more stable than the

chlorides.

   A fraction at 322° 0. gave 72-61 C and 4-28 H. Therefore nearly pure diacetate.
    We have some proof that a chlormonacetate is also formed as well as soma

chlorinated diacetates. Of these we have isolated one product, which on analvsis

gives (I) 11-01 per cent. CI; (II) 11-4 per cent. CI: CisH.Cl.^CaHjOJ.j requires
11-2 per cent. CI. It melts at about 60° C.

     Acenaphtene diacetate distils at about 290° 0. and melts at 46°.

   We --are obtaining larger quantities of these acetates fluorene, acenaphtene, and
--dibenzyl in order to study them further.

                   Section C--GEOLOGY.

     --President op the Sectiox L. Fletcheb, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

                             THURSDA Y, A UG UST 9.

    The President delivered tlie following Address :

With an anxious desire to conform to the traditions of the past, I have sought in the
myReports of the Association for guidance in present difficulty, and, doing so, have

remarked that it is customary for a president, on first taking the Chair, to express

Mya deep sense of unworthiness for the position to which he has been called.
myfirst duty, then, seemed a simple and obvious one ; till I further remarked, to

dismay,that the more able and distinguished the President the more humble have been

the terms in which such expression has been made. Hence I feel that it may appear

to you presumptuous on my part if I myself make any apology at all, and it would

doubtless imply a claim to the highest ability and distinction were I to make that
humble apology which would be really appropriate to the circumstances of the case.

   --Instead, however, of dispensing with the apology altogether that might be
--too radical an innovation to be introduced this year I propose, with your

sanction, to make a lesser change, and merely to defer the apology from the first
to the last day of our session. I may reasonably hope to be able, at that later
stage, to make clear to you, by simple reference to yoiu: own experience during

the Meeting, that the apology I shall then feel it my duty to make is of no merely

formal character, but one which is worthy of your serious consideration.
     I would ask that in the meantime your continuous sympathy be extended to

one who now finds himself in a position he would have been the last to seek, and

whose ordinary duties in life involve speechless communion with inanimate Nature
rather than oral address to an assembly of fellow-workers.

     This matter of apologetic precedent being thus disposed of to our common

satisfaction, I should have preferred to have brought the delay of the normal
business of the Section to an immediate end by calling upon the author of the

first paper to now address you. Such, indeed, was the ordinary course of pro-

cedure in the earlier, and perhaps presidentially happier, years of the Association
but the occasion of taking the chair having been once seized upon, in absence
of mind, by a mathematical president for the delivery of an address, it has como

about that each president now feels it his bounden duty, not merely to give an
address, but to make that address at least as long and at least as elaborate as any

which has preceded it.

    We shall all agree that a presidential address, if there is to be any at all,

 should be elaborately short and elaborately simple ; it should deal, not with,
 technical details such as are only intelligible, even to the president himself, after

 much study, but with general principles such as can be immediately grasped by
 every member of an audience : an opening address which is so long that it can l3e only

 partly read, and is written to be studied afterwards in the Reports of the Associa-

 tion, may more appropriately be issued as an ordinary memoir. I make this remark
632 REPORT-- 1894.

to safeg'uard tlie interests of future audiences, foo.' tlie example of technicality which

I am now about to set is one which 1 cannot recommend my successors to follow.

As for subject, a record of recent scientific progress is always interest-

ing and instructive, and immediately suggests itself as the natural basis of

a presidential address. But seeing that, so lately as in February last, the

geologists have had the advantage of an address from the retiring president of

their Society, Mr. Hudleston, which has been virtually exhaustive in its survey

and criticism of the British geological work of the last seven years, the time has

scarcely yet arrived when a continuation of that review by the president of this

Section can be of service to the members of the Association.

For this and other still more weighty reasons which I need not directly

mention, I feel myself debarred from undertaking any review of recent geological

discovery, and shall therefore ask you to allow me to confine myself, in the
remarks it is my duty to make, to a science which, though it is not purely

geological, and in the Reports of the Association has long been associated with

the science of another Section, Chemistry, is yet very closely related to the science

of our own Section, Geology.

I trust that the members of the Section of Chemistry and Mineralogy are now

so closely engaged in another place that they will fail to discover, or at any rate to

resent, the technical trespass on their own domain : as for yourselves, you will

perhaps be more ready to pardon the temporary excursion from the field of pure

Geology if I remind you that the Fathers of the Geological Society defined their

sole object to be 'the investigation of the mineral structure of the Earth ; ' and I

may add, if further defence be desired, that in the first half of this century the

relationship of Mineralogy and Geology was so intimate that it was possible for a
Section of the British Museum to be long officially designated ' the Department of

Mineralogy, including Geology.'

I was the more impelled to choose this subject for our consideration to-day

when I reflected that pure Mineralogy has been hitherto almost completely out of

sight, and therefore probably out of mind, at the Meetings of the Association. It

is true that at the first Meeting, held sixty-three years ago, Mr. Whewell, then the

Professor of Mineralogy at Cambridge, was invited to draw up a report on the state

of knowledge of the science, and that his report was submitted and printed in the

foUowiog 3'ear. But in the course of the sixty-three years during which the Asso-

ciation has flourished, it has chanced that a devotee of pure mineralogy has on only

one occasion, that of 1862, been seated in a presidential chair ; and since at that

time presidential addresses had not yet come to be regarded as necessary to the

existence of the Sections, Professor Miller, with admirable discretion, refrained from

inflicting a mineralogical dissertation on an audience which, he had reason to pre-

sume, must consist entirely, or almost entirely, of chemists.

Perhaps you might be tempted to think that the Avant of prominence of the

mineralogists at our previous Meetings has been due to a becoming sense of

modesty resulting from the study of that science : this would be a mistake. The

fact is that a mineralogical memoir, dealing largely with numerical quantities and

involving great variety of experiment and technicality, may be read and studied,

but should never be heard ; like the mathematician, the mineralogist despairs of

making clear to an audience, especially a mixed one, the bearing of any researches

which have been made in his subject. But now that sixty-two years have elapsed

since the issue of Professor Whewell's Report, the time has perhaps at length

arrived when it is advisable, notwithstanding the difficulties surrounding an oral

treatment of Mineralogy, to attempt to give to the Association a faint idea of the

mypresent position of the study of the subject. And if most of  hearers find that

the remarks are too technical to be in any great part intelligible, let them console

themselves with the reflection that, if the future at all resembles the past, only

Shalum and Ililpa can have to endure again that particular kind of mauvais quart

d'heure which is to precede the Geological Feast of to-day.

   --Tlie Systems of Crystallisation. At the time of the publication of Professor

Whewell's Report it had already been established by the researches of Rome de

TRANSACTIONS OV SECTION C.  633

risle, Ilaliy, Molis, aod Weiss that the position of any single face of any crystal
can be exactly defined by means of two sets of quantities : firstly, three lines or
axes, of which the lengths and mutual inclinations are characteristic of the substance
itself; secondly, three whole numbers or indices, rarely rising higher in magnitude
than the nutnber 6 ; further, an empirical arrangement of crystals into systems
had been based by Mohs and Weiss on the relative lengths and inclinations of the

axes. And a long series of observations of the optical characters of crystals had

revealed to Brewster the fact that the boundaries oi the classes of optically isotropic,
uniaxal and biaxal crystals form part of the boundaries of the empirical systems.
But whereas only three optical classes of crystals had been recognised, it was certain
that there were at least four geometrical systems, and it was a matter of contro-
versy as to whether the independence of two others should not be regarded as

geometrically established.

     The first important discovery following the issue of Whewell's lleport was one
which proved that the two doubted systems are natural ones. It was found by
Herschel and Neumann that the biaxal crystals are not optically similar, as had

--hitherto been supposed, but are of three kinds. In crystals of one kind for
--example, barytes the two lines bisecting the angle of the optic axes internally and

externally, and a third line perpendicular to both, are constant in direction in the

--crystal whatever the colour of the light ; in a second kind for instance, selenite
--only one of these lines is constant when the colour varies ; in a third kind for

--instance, axinile none of the three lines has any constancy of direction. And these

three kiuds of biaxal crystals correspond exactly in their facial development to the
three systems of crystallisation of which the independence had already been asserted

by some crystallographers on geometrical grounds. From this time the arrange-
ment of crystals into the six systems has been regarded as a natural one ; and the
optical method based on the figures seen in plates when examined in convergent

polarised light has been in constant use, and is an invaluable aid in the determination

of the system of crystallisation.

   --Crystalloijraphic Notation. For a simple method of expressing the relative

positions of crystal faces by a symbol, crystallographers are infinitely indebted to
the late Professor Miller of Cambridge. The symbols introduced by Mohs, Weiss,
L^vy, Naumann, and the modification of the latter suggested by Dana, though
interesting, are not to be compared for legibility, pronounceability, or utility in
calculation, with the simple symbol which is associated with the name of Professor
Miller. Though the symbol was not invented by him, he was the one who, so to

saj', gave it life. He discovered and made known its many advantages ; and in

--his Treatise published in 1839 a treatise which is a masterpiece of mathematical
--terseness and simple elegance he gave the methods of crystallographic calcula-

tion which render the advantages of the symbol particularly manifest. It may be

here remarked that in that treatise the rationality of the anharmonic ratios of anj'

four tautozonal planes of a crystal was first made known, and the property was

largely used in the simplification of the methods of calculation : the fact that the
fraction was of the kind which had been already termed an anharmonic ratio,

however, had escaped the attention of the author.
      But the change of a method of notation, like a change in a system of weights

and measures, involves such serious practical difficulties that many years passed
away before the Millerian symbol received abroad the consideration which it
deserved. Now, at last, no Continental text-book of Mineralogy fails to introduce
the Millerian indices, even if the symbols of L6vy or of Naumann are given in
 addition and it is evident that within a few more years the mineralogist will be

                                                    ;

 completely relieved from the tiresome necessity of translating each crystalline
symbol into another form to make it intelligible to him, and the student will be
 able to make a more advantageous use of the time which has been hitherto
 devoted to acquiring a mastery over a second and unnecessary form of crystallo-
 graphic notation. For this result credit is largely due to Professor Groth of

 Munich, whose adoption of the Millerian symbol in the ' Zeitschrift fiir Krystallo-

graphie ' has done much to bring home its advantages to the foreign worker. It is
 to be hoped that Professor Groth will earn the further gratitude of students by
634 REPORT--1894.

encouraging the adoption of the true Millerian symhol in the still outstanding case

of the Ehomhohedral System.

  --Rationality of Indices and the Laio of Zones. It may here be pointed out

that, although the importance of zones for the simplification of crystaUographic

calculation had been recognised by Weiss, it was only later that Neumann proved

that the fact that all possible crystal faces can be derived by means of the inter-

section of zones is a necessary consequence of the rationality of the indices ; that,

indeed, the law of zones is mathematically identical with the law of rationality.

To the same able physicist and mathematician we owe the development of the
method of stereographic projection now in common use by crj'stallographers for

-- Wethe representation of the poles of crystal faces.
Symmetry.                                                                                    have said that the recognition of six systems of crystallisation

was a result of consideration of the lengths and mutual inclinations of certain
lines called axes. Now, it had long ago been remarked that any one face of a

crystal is accompanied by certain others similarly related to the geometrically

similar parts of what may be regarded as a fundamental figure : such a group of
concurrent faces is called a simple form. It came to be recognised, too, that all
the faces of such a form can be geometrically derived from any one of them by

repetition, according to certain laws of symmetry, and that the same laws of
symmetrj^ are binding for every simple form or combination of forms exhibited by
crystals of the same substance. Hence it came to be perceived, though very
slowly, that the essential diflerences of the systems of crystallisation are not mere

differences of lengths and mutual inclinations of lines of reference, but are really

differences of symmetry. Ever since his appointment to the professorship of

Mineralogy in this University, now tliirty-eight j-ears ago, Mr. Maslcelyne has

been persistent in directing attention to the importance of symmetry', and such

importance now receives universal recognition.

   --Thirty-two Types of Symmetry in Crystals. But in each system of crystallisation

it becomes necessary to recognise both completely and partially symmetrical types.
In the latter, the symmetry is in abeyance relative to various planes or lines which
In other crystals of the same system are active as planes or axes of symmetry. But

this abeyance of symmetry is itself found to be subject to a law, for all planes or

axes of symmetry which are geometrically similar are either simultaneously active

or simultaneously in abeyance. By means of this law relating to partial symmetry,

it has been inferred that altogether thirty-two types of symmetry are possible in

the six crystalline systems.

     The possible existence of these thirty-two types of symmetry of crystals is thus

an induction from observation : the question naturally arises as to why only these

thirty-two exist or are inferred by analogy to be possible. Axes of symmetry are

observed round which faces of crystals are symmetrically repeated by twos or threes

or fours or sixes                                                                            why is it that  in crystals  no  axis of  symmetry is ever met with
                                                                                          ;

Around which the faces are symmetrically repeated by fives or sevens ? few words

as to how this most important problem has been attacked and solved may be of

interest.

   We know that the characters of a crj'stal relative to any line in it vary with

the direction of the line, but are the same for all lines parallel to each other. Such

a property will result if we imagine with Bravais that in a crystal elementary

particles are arranged at equal distances from each other along every line, and are

similarly arranged in all those lines which are parallel to each other ; the distances
separating particles being, however, in general different for lines which are inclined

to each other. Such an arrangement of particles is termed parallelepipedal : space

may be imagined to be completely filled with equal and similarly disposed parallele-

pipeds, and an elementary particle to be placed at every corner or quoin of each.

Further, each particle is regarded, not as being spherical, but as having diflerent

--characters on its different sides ; and the particles must be similarly orientated that

is, have similar sides in similar positions.
     Now, it will be seen on examination of a model or figure that with such an

arrangement any plane containing three particles will contain an infinite number,

all arranged at the corners of parallelograms. Further, any such plane will clearly
TRANSACTION'S OF SECTION C.  635

have whole numbers for the indices which fix its position, for along any line the

distance between two particles is by hypothesis a whole multiple of the common
distance between any two adjacent ones in the same line. Thus the first great

-- --crystallographic law the law of the rationality of the indices is an immediate

consequence.

     In the next place, it was found that the possiblemodesof symmetry of arrange-
ment of the particles of such a system depend on the form of the parallelepiped,
and that any possible arrangement of the particles must present a symmetry which
is identical with one or other of the six completely symmetrical types already

--referred to. And calculation shows that any other mode of grouping a repetition

--by fives or sevens, for example round an axis of symmetry, would involve the pre-

sence of planes having irrational indices ; and this according to the first law is

impossible.

     The abeyance of symmetry, however, met with in the partially symmetrical

--types required the aid of an auxiliary hypothesis namely, that the abeyance of

symmetry belongs to the particle itself, and not to the arrangement of the

particles.

     But the parallelepipedal arrangement imagined by Bravais is unnecessarily
special. Our actual observations of physical characters relate not to single lines of
particles, but to groups of parallel lines of particles : the identity of character
observed in parallel directions is thus not necessarily due to actual identity of each
line with its neighbour, but may be due to statistical equality, an equality of
averages. If, for example, a plane were divided into regular hexagons, and a

particle were placed at each corner of each of these figures, the physical properties
of the system of particles would be the same along all lines parallel to each other
as far as experiment could decide, and yet the arrangement of the particles in the
plane, though possibly crystalline, is not that of a Bravais system. In any straight
line passing along the sides of a series of the hexagons, the particles will not be
equidistant from each other: they are in equidistant pairs, and the two nearest
particles of adjacent pairs are twice as far from each other as the particles of the

same pair.
      Sohncke accordingly suggested a more general definition than that of Bravais

for the regularity of the arrangement, a definition which had been proposed some

--years before by Wiener namely, that the grouping relative to any one particle is

identical with that relative to any other. This definition admits of the possibility
 of the hexagonal arrangement j ust mentioned ; further, it allows of the orientation
 of the particles themselves being diflferent in adjacent lines. Following a mathe-
 matical process which had been already employed by Jordan, Sohncke deduced all

the possible modes of grouping consistent with the new definition, and for a time
 was under the impression that the types of symmetry found by him to be mathe-

 matically possible are exactly identical with those already referred to ; and this
 without introducing the auxiliary hypothesis relative to partial symmetry of the
 elementary particles of merosymmetrical crystals, except in cases of hemimorphism.

 It was, however, pointed out by Wulfl^, who has himself made valuable contri-
 butions to the subject, that though no unknown crystallographic type belongs to

 such a regular arrangement, one type of symmetry, that presented by dioptase, is
 missing ; and it seems that, in this case at least, the merosymmetry can only be
 accounted for by the merosymmetry of the particle, or something equivalent to

 it, if the definition of regularity suggested by Sohncke is to be accepted. It was
 recognised by Sohncke that each of his point-systems can be regarded as a com-

 posite Bravais system, one of the latter being repeated in various positions corre-
 sponding with the symmetry of the parallelepiped itself.

   --More recently, Schonflies has made a more general hypothesis still namely,

 that in each substance, whether its crystals be completely or partially symmetrical
 in facial development, the particles are not of a single kind, but of two kinds,

 related to each other in form in much the same way as a right-hand glove and a
 left-hand glove. With this hypothesis he finds that all the thirty-two known types

 are accounted for without any specialisation of the characters of the particle, and

 that no other type of symmetry is mathematically possible.
636 REPOKT-- 189-1.

It now only remained to discover that Professor Hessel had already arrived at

the thirty-two types of crystallographic symmetry by mathematical reasoning

more than sixty years ago ; his \vork, being far in advance of his time, appears to
have attracted no attention, and the memoir remained unnoticed till more than half

a century after its publication.

Starting from Sohneke s definition of a regular point-system, and proceeding,

though independently, by a method wbich closely resembles that of the regular

partitioning of space by Schunflies, Mr. William Barlow has given in a paper just

issued a general definition applicable to all homogeneous structuies whatever, and

has shown that every such homogeneous structure falls into one or other of thirty-

two types of symmetry, coinciding exactly with the tbirty-two types of crystal-

symmetry, lie points out that each of those homogeneous structures which possess

planes of symmetry or centres of symmetry does so by reason of its having an

additional property beyond mere homogeneity, namely, that if we disregard mere

orientation, it is identical with its own image in a mirror. Mr. Barlow further

discovers that every one of the Sohuckian point-systems can be geometrically con-

structed by finite repetition of some one of a certain ten of them.

Lord Kelvin, who, with characteristic versatility, has lately enlightened us with

his researches on Molecular Tactics, has quite recently attacked another problem

of the same group, and has sought to discover the most general form of cell which

shall be such that each cell encloses a single point of a Bravais system, while all the

cells resemble the parallelepipeds, of which we have already spoken, in being equal,

Hesimilar, similarly orientated, and in completely tilling up space.        finds that in

the general case the cell can have at most fourteen walls, which may be themselves

either plane or curved, and m.ay meet in edges either plane or curved. Having

regard, however, to the limited time at our disposal, we may hesitate before

foliowiug Lord Kelvin into his curious and many-walled cell.

The deduction of the thirty-two types of symmetry by mathematical reasoning

was also made independently by both Gadolin and Viktor von Lang thirty years

ago from the law of rationality of indices ; while Fedorow points out that the

method of deduction recorded in the recent German treatise of Schonflies is

remarkably similar to the one independently published by himself in Russia.

Both Curie and Minnigerode have also lately given comparatively brief solutions

of the problem.

Nor must I omit to mention to you the elaborate memoir dealing with the

.symmetry of parallelepipedal point-systems which was written by the late Pro-

fessor Henry Stephen Smith, whose too early death this University has so much

reason to deplore. To the outer world he was perhaps best known as one of the

most perfect mathematicians of the age, but those who had the good fortune to find

themselves among his pupils will always treasure up in their memory rather the
kindly courtesy, the warm sympathy of the man, than the genius, however tran-

scendent, of the mathematician.

  --To sum up this part of the subject it is now established that a definition of the

regularity of a point-system can be so framed that thirty-two, and only thirty-two,

types of symmetry are mathematically possible in a regular system, and that these

are identical with the types of symmetry that have been actually observed in

-crystals, or are inferred by analogy to be crystallographically possible.

It remains for subsequent investigators to determine what the points of the

.system really correspond to in the crystal ; according to Schonflies, the physicist

and the chemist can be allowed in each crystal absolute control within a definite

elementary region of space, and the crystallographer is only entitled to demand

that the features of this region are repeated throughout space according to one or

other of the thirty-two types of symmetry already referred to ; or, what appears

-- Weto be the same thing, the crystallographer requires mere homogeneity of structure.
Simplicity of Indices.            have seen that the planes containing points of a

regular point-system have rational indices. But there still remains unaccounted

.for the remarkable fact that the indices of the natural limiting faces, and also of

the cleavage-planes of a crystal, are not merely whole numbers, but are in general

extremely simple whole numbers. Bravais and his followers have sought to account
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                   637

for this by the hypothesis that both the natural limiting planes and the cleavage-

planes are those planes of a point-system which are most densely sprinkled with

points of the system. Curie and Liveing, independently of each other, have been

led to the same result from considerations relative to capillary constants. Sohncke,

-- --however, pointing out that there are many cases for instance, calcite where an

excellent cleavage-plane is rarely a limiting plane, suggests that his generalised

point-system is more satisfactory than a Bravais system in that not only the density

of the sprinkling must be had regard to, but also the tangential cohesion of the-

particles in the plane, end that in his system these may be independent of each

other; while Wulft" remarks that Sohncke's arrangement is identical with that of

Bravais for the anorthic system, where the same objection holds, and he denies the-

legitimacy of the reasoning by which the hypothesis of a relation between the

density of the sprinkling of points on a plane and the likelihood of the natural

occurrence of the plane as a limiting face is supported.

   --Complexity of Indices. Doubtless, however, crystal faces are observed of which
--the symbols involve indices far exceeding 6 in magnitude so complex, in fact, that

one is tempted to doubt the rigidity of the experimental proof that indices are

necessarily rational. Often, though the numbers are high, their ratios differ by

Aonly small amounts from simple ones.  most patient and detailed study of such

faces was made for danburite by the late Dr. Max Schuster of Vienna, and the
results were brought by him some years ago to the notice of this Section. From

careful examination of similar faces in the case of quartz, Molengraaft" has been

led to conclude that it is extremely probable that such faces are of secondary

origin and have been the result of etching : they would in such case correspond,

not to original limiting planes, but to directions in which the crystal yields most

--readily to solvent or decomposing influences.
      Optical Characters. Passing from the purely geometrical characters of crystals

to the optical, we may in the first place remark that the relationship between crys-

talline form and circular polarisation discovered by Herschel in the case of quartz
Wehas been generalised since the issue of Whewell's Report.
                                                             now know that

many crystallised substances belonging to different systems give circular polarisa-

tion, and that all of them are merosymmetrical in facial development or structure;

further, they belong to types of symmetry which have a common feature, though

this is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition.

     The importance of the discovery of the dispersion of the mean lines has

already been referred to.

    We may recall attention to the fact noticed by Norremberg, that when cleavage-

plates of biaxal mica are crossed in pairs and the pairs are piled one upon another

in similar positions, the optical figure yielded by the combination approaches nearer
and nearer to that of a uniaxal crystal the thinner the plates and the more nume-
rous the pairs : in the same way, by means of triplets of plates, each plate being-

turned through one-third of a complete revolution from the position of the preced-

ing one, Reusch found it possible to closely imitate the optical figure of a right-

handed or a left-handed circularly polarising crystal.

    And it has been observed that repeated combinations of differently orientated

parts actually occur in crystals. Large crystals of potassium ferrocyanide, for

example, are really composite, and the different parts are differently orientated :

on the one hand, a thick slice may give an optical figure which is uniaxal; on

the other hand, a thin slice shows two optic axes inclined to each other at a con-

siderable angle.

     It has been suggested that the circular polarisation of quartz and other crystals-

is due to a spiral molecular arrangement corresponding to that of the mica-tripleta
as arranged by Reusch. Such a spiral arrangement is shown by the points of the

corresponding Sohnckian system.

   --Optical Anomalies. As already mentioned, we owe to Brewster the establish-

ment of the relation between the optical behaviour of crystals and the systems of
crystallisation. But in the course of his long research Brewster met with numerous

puzzling exceptions, and to the investigation of the origin of their peculiar optical

behaviour he devoted much study ; subsequent workers have concurred in express-
--638
                             REPORT 1894'.

ing tlieir admiration of the accuracy of hia observations and descriptions, more

especially when regard is had to the extreme simplicity of the apparatus available,

in those early days.

     It was recognised by Brewster that some of these optical anomalies are due to
a condition of strain of the crystal, as in the case of the diamond. But in other
minerals, as analcime and apophyllite, the hypothesis of strain was not entertained

bv him :  he  regarded  the  crystals  as  being truly composite and  not  simple                                   and,
                                                                                                                 ;

recognising optically different kinds of apophyllite, went so far as to give to one of

them the specific name of tesselite by reason of its distinctive characters. Biot, on

the other hand, sought to account for this kind of optical behaviour in another

way, by the hypothesis of lamellar polarisation : a crystal of alum, for example, he

held to be built up of thin laminae arranged parallel to the octahedral planes, and

imagined that light which has traversed such a crystal is polarised by its passage

through the aggregation of laminae in the same way as by pas.sage through a pile

of glass plates. But in the latter case there is a frequent passage of the light from

air to glass and glass to air, whereas in the case of alum there is no evidence of the

existence of atmospheric intervals. Frankenheim sought to overcome this diffi-

culty by the further hypothesis that the successive layers of a composite potassium-

and ammonium-alum are of different chemical composition, but such a difference of

material would be insufficient for the desired object by reason of the nearness to

each other of the refractive indices of alums of different composition. Still, it is a
remarkable fact that neither a pure potassium-alum nor a pure ammonium-alum

shows any depolarisation-eft'ects at all ; these belong only to the alums of mixed

composition, and yet there is no visible difference in the physical structure of the

crystals of simple and composite material.

    An epoch was made in the history of the so-called optical anomalies by tlie

publication in 1876 of an elaborate memoir by Pi'ofessor Ernest Mallard of Paris,
whose death last month deprived Mineralogy of its greatest philosopher. To make
the position more clear, we may take as a definite illustration the mineral boracite.

In development of faces and magnitude of angles the crystals of this mineral are,

as far as measurement with the goniometer can decide, precisely cubic in their
symmetry. But an apparently simple crystal of boracite, when examined in

polarised light, behaves exactly like a regularly composite body. If the crystal be

a rhombic dodecahedron in external development, all the twelve pyramids which

can be formed by drawing lines from the centre to the angular points are found to

be exactly similar to each other in everything but orientation ; and, further, each of

them has the optical characters of a biaxal crystal, the optic bisectrix of each

individual pyramid being perpendicular to the corresponding base, and thus having

a different direction for each of the si.x pairs of parallel faces of the dodecahedron.

Hence Mallard inferred that boracite belongs i-eally, not to the cubic, but to the

orthorhombic system, and that its crystallographic elements are so nearly those of

ma cubic crystal that the molecular structure is stable equilibrium, not only when

different molecules have their similar lines parallel, but also when only approxi-

mately similar lines have the same orientation ; further, the cubic symmetry of

the external form was regarded by him as a consequence of the approximation of

the crystallographic elements to those of a cubic crystal and of the variety of

orientation of the constituent molecules. Variety of orientation of constituent

molecules is, in fact, already recognised in the case of ordinary interpenetrant

twins. The variation of optical character in different crystals of the same
substance or different parts of the same crystal was then explained as being due

to the variation in the number of molecules belonging to each mode of orientation.
     According to another view, it was contended that a crystal of boracite is really

cubic and simple, but that, like unannealed glass, it is in a state of strain related

to the external form. It was replied that the optical characters of such

unamiealed glass are changed with the change of strain which follows the fracture

of the specimen, while those of boracite are unaltered when the crystal is broken.
To this it was rejoined that a once compressed gum retains its depolarising cha-
racter unchanged on fracture of the specimen, and that the same permanence may

very well be a character of some strained crystallised bodies.
TKAN3ACTI0NS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                639

The controversy, however, passed to a fresh stage when it was discovered that

boracite becomes optically isotropic when sufficiently heated, and resumes an

optically composite character on cooling'. Mallard showed that the temperature at

which the change takes place is a definite one, 265° C.,and that a definite amount

of heat is absorbed or given out during the change of condition.

    It is now agreed that boracite is really dimorphous ; that above 265° it is cubic

in symmetry, below 265° orthorhombic : the only remaining point of controversy

as regards boracite seems to be whether the external form owes its cubic symmetry

to the crystallisation having taken place at a temperature higher than 265°, and

therefore when the structure itself was truly cubic, or at a temperature below

265°, in which case the cubic character of the form would be ascribed to the fact

that the orthorhombic constituent particles are so nearly cubic in their dimensions

that at any temperature they may by variety of orientation combine to form a

structure having practically cubic symmetry, and naturally limiting itself by faces

corresponding to such a symmetry.

In exactly the same way leucite and tridymite become respectively optically

isotropic and uniaxal when sufficiently heated, and the optical characters then

correspond exactly to the symmetry of the external form.

Three years ago Dr. Brauns pre-pared a most useful summary of the ninety-four

memoirs which had up to that time been contributed relative to the much-dis-

cussed subject of the optical anomalies of crystals, and added many new experi-

--mental results which had been obtained by himself He concludes that the

original view of Mallard namely, that an optically anomalous structure consists

merely of differently orientated particles of the same kind and of symmetry

--approximating to a higher type is only applicable to a very limited number of

crystals, such as those of  prehnite                                           that  dimorphism  is  the  true cause  in  others,
                                                                            ;

boracite being an example ; that in the remaining minerals the cause is strain,

which in some of thera is due to foreign enclosures, as in the case of the diamond,

and in others is due to a molecular action between isomorphous substances, as in

the mixed alums and the garnets.

  --Planes of Gliding. One of the most startling of crystallographic discoveries

was one made by Reusch, who found that if a crystal of calcite is compressed in a

certain way each particle springs into a new but definite position, exactly as if the

crystal had undergone a simple shear and the particles at the same time had each

described a semi-somersault: a simpler method of produring the same result was

discovered afterwards by Baumhauer. If only part of the calcite crystal is sheared,

the two parts of the structure itself are related to each other in the same way as

the two parts of a twin growth ; but in general the external form is different from
that of a twin, since after the shearing of the material few of the faces retain their

former crystallographic signification. The property has since been shown by Bauer,

Liebisch, and more especially Miigge, to be a very general one ; and doubtless the

so-called twin lamellae met with in rock-constituents have in many cases resulted

from pressure during earth-movements long subsequent to the epoch of formation

of the crystals. Similar lamellae have been produced artificially in anhydrite and

some kinds of felspar by exposure of the crystals to a high temperature.

  --Piezo-electricity. The most remarkable addition to our knowledsre of the

relation of minerals and electricity has been the recent discovery of the electrifica-

tion produced by strain (pifzo-electricity). It has been shown by J. and P. Curie

that if a quartz-plate, with faces cut parallel to the axis and silvered to make them

conductive, be strained in a certain direction, the two faces either become oppositely

electrified or show no signs of electrification at all, according as the faces of the

plate are cut to be perpendicular to the prism-faces, or to p«ss through the prism-

edges. Lord Kelvin says that this result is explicable by electric eolotropy of the

molecule and by nothing else, a character which he had suggested for the molecule

thirty-four years ago : experiments confirmatory of this hypothesis of the permanent

electrification of the molecule were made some time ago by Riecke.

   --Fyro-electricity. The development of opposite electricities at different parts of

a crystal during changirg temperature (pyro-electricity) has long bt^en known in

Wethe case of tourmaline.   owe to Hankel a long series of investigations of this
                                                                                                  ;

kind relative to boracite, topaz, and various other minerdls, but it seems to be now-

established that most of the electrifications observed by means of his method are

really piezo-electric, and are due to strains caused by inequality of temperature in

Adifferent parts of the cooling crystal.                                                          model has been lately made by Lord

Kelvin which gives a perfect mechanical representation of the elasticity, the piezo-

electricity, and also the pyro-electricity of a crystal.
--AElectrical Methods.
                                                                                                  delightfully simple method of investigating the

difference of electrical condition of the parts of a cooling crystal and of making the

distribution of electricity visible to the eye has been invented by Kundt. Mixed

particles of (red) minium and (yellow) sulphur are oppositely electrified by their

passage through the meshes of a small sieve ; falling on the cooling crystal, each

particle adheres to the oppositely electrified region, and the electrical condition of

the latter is thus immediately indicated by the colour of the adherent powder.

Mr. Miers remarks that this method is practically useful as a means of discrimina-

tion even when the crystals are extremely minute.

   --Other Physical Characters. Of other physical characters much studied since

the issue of Whewell's Report, I may recall to you more especially the dilatation

of crystals on change of temperature, in which the observations of Mitscherlich

have been extended by Fizeau and Beckenkamp; the forms of the isothermal

surfaces of crystals, as determined by S^narmont, and afterwards by Rontgen; the

magnetic induction treated of by Faraday, Lord Kelvin, Pliicker, and Tyndall

the hardness of crystals for different directions lying in the same faces, by Grailich,

Pekarek, and Exner; the elasticity of crystals, investigated by Neumann, Lord

Kelvin, Voigt, Baumgarten, and Koch ; the distortion of crystals in an electro-

magnetic field, by Kundt, Rontgen, and MM. Curie.

   --Cheviical Relations. In the short time I can reasonably ask you to allow me

it is clearly impossible to enter upon any discussion of the increase of our know-

ledge of the chemical relations of minerals, and to treat of the much-investigated

subjects--isomorphism, polymorphism, and morphotropy ; nor can I attempt to give
you any idea of the advance which has been made towards a natural classification :

nor must I mention the experiments which have been made relative to the growth

--of crystals, the etching of their faces, or their directions of easiest solution.
    Systematic Mineralogy. As regards systematic mineralogy an immense amount

-- Weof progress has been made. The condition of affairs in 1 832 was described by Whewell
as follows : '                                                                                    have very few minerals of which the chemical constitution is not

liable to some dispute ; scarcely a single species of which the rules and limits are

                                                                                               ;

idea of the extent of the improvement will be best obtained from a comparison of

the first edition of Dana's Treatise, published in 1837, and that treasury of infor-

mation, the sixth edition, which appeared in 1892. The names of Miller and

Uesclcizeaux are to be honourably mentioned in connection with this detailed

work on species. In the interval of time under consideration the number of well-

established species has been more than doubled, and the rate at which new species

are discovered shows as yet no sign of diminution. In particular, I may remind

you of the work which has been done in the correlation of the members of large

groups, like the felspars, aniphiboles, pyroxenes, scapolites, micas, tourmalines, and

Agarnets.       paper just published by Penfield relative to topaz furnishes an

excellent illustration of the important results which are still to be arrived at from

a careful study of a common mineral. It has long been known that the mutual

inclination of the optic axes of topaz is very different in different specimens, and it

has been suspected that the variation might depend on the percentage of fluorine.

Professor Penfield has carefully determined, not only the fluorine, but also the

water yielde 1 in the course of analysis of specimens from different localities, and

firds that tliH analytical results are best explained by the hypothesis of an iso-

jnorphous replacement of fluorine by hydroxyl ; further, he discovers that the

magnitude of the angle between the optic axes is a function of the amount of that

replacement.

The successes achieved in the artificial formation of minerals, the advances

made in the methods of discrimination of minerals by the blowpipe and micro-

chemical reactions, the increase in our knowledge of the modes of alteration of

minerals, of their association, of their modes of occurrence, must all be left

undiscussed.

  --Instruments. I may add a word relative to the instrumental appliances which

have been placed at the service of the mineralogist since the issue of Whewell's

Report. As regards goniometers, the provision of two mechanical circular move-

ments in perpendicular planes for the easier adjustment of a crystal-edge parallel

to the axis of the instrument, first suggested by Viktor von Lang when assistant

at the British Museum, has proved a great convenience and is njw in general use.

The employment of a collimator with interchangeable signals, of a telescope with

interchangeable eyepieces, and the provision of lenses and diaphragms for obtaining

images from faces so small as to be invisible to the unassisted eye, would seem to

have brought the reHective goniometer, the invention of our distinguished country-

man Dr. Wollaston, to a degree of perfection where further improvement is scarcelv

to be looked for; though two crystallographers, Fedorow and Goldschmidt, have

recently constructed instruments with an additional telescope and entirely different

arrangements. It may be worthy of remark that, though reflective goniometers are

generally made for use with very small specimens, one was constructed for the British
Museum some years ago by which it is possible to measure the angles of a valuable

crystal without removal of the specimen from a matrix of several pounds' weight.

The polariscope for use with convergent light, the stauroscope, the employment

of polarised light with the microscope, the adaptation of the microscope Cor the

observation of the interference-figures yielded by extremely minute crystals, the

spectroscope in the investigation of selective absorption, have all proved of great

service in the advancement of our knowledge of the characters of minerals.

Worthy of special mention is that recent addition to our resources, the total

reflectometer, an instrument by which it is possible to determine with wonderful

accuracy the refractive index or indices from observation of the reflected light.

The process was long ago suggested by Wollaston; but it is only within the last

few years that forms of instrument have been devised by Kohlrausch, Soret, Lie-

bisch, Pulfrich, and Abbe, which make the method as precise in its results as that

which depends on refraction by a prism. In its more refined forms the total

reflectometer has been used to test the accuracy of the form of Fresnel's wave-

.surface                              in the convenient, though less precise, form devised by Bertrand, the
                                   :

instrument is useful in the discrimination of the species of minerals.

For the measurement of the optic axal angle, when the angle is so large that

the rays corresponding to the optic axes are totally reflected at the surface^of the

plate and do not emerge into air from the crystal. Professor W. G. Adams

made the valuable suggestion that the crystal-plate should be interposed between
two hemispheres of glass ; several instruments on this principle have been con-

structed abroad, and have only been imperfectly satisfactory, but one lately made

in this country for the British Museum, under the superintendence of my excellent

colleague Mr. Miers, proves to be most eflicient for the intended purpose. Mr.

Tutton's apparatus for supplying monochromatic light of any desired wave-length

is a noteworthy addition to the instrumental resources of the mineralogist. The

meldometer of Joly for the more accurate determination of the fusing point of

minerals should also be recalled to you.

     In this slight sketch it has been possible to make only the barest mention of
some of the more important results which have been arrived at since the issue of
VVhewell's Report. You will doubtless think that it must have been possible in

the year 1832 to look forward enthusiastically to the progress which was about to
be made. But though Professor Whewell was himself confident that valuable

discoveries would reward the mineralogical worker, he was sadly depressed, and,
I think I may venture to say, with good reason, by the neglect of mineralogical

study in this country. Ilis own words are : ' This decided check in the progress of
the science has, I think, without question, very much damped the interest with which

                                                                           REPORT 1894.

Mineralogy, ns a brancli of Natural Pliilosophy, has been looked upon in England.

Indeed, tins feeling appears to have gone sa far that all the general questions of
the science excite with us scnrcely any notice whatever. But a more forvrard
and hopeful spirit appears to have prevailed for some time in other countries,
especially Sweden, Germany, and more recently France.' Those are the words

of despair of the future of i3iitish Mineralogy. I may add that in the same year

he resigned his professorship of Mineralogy, and directed his vast energy to the

advancement of other subjects; many of you will remember that he afterwards

became Professor of MorarPbilosophy and Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.

    Now, 1 tliink that a country like our own, which aims at taking and maintain-
ing a high place in the scale of civilisation, ought in some way or other to secure

that in every important branch of learning there is a group of men in the country

·who will make it the main purpose of their lives to render themselves familiar

with all that has been and is being discovered in the subject, will do whatever is
possible to fill up the gaps in the science, and, last but not least, will make the

more important results accessible to other workers for whom so complete and

original a survey is impracticable.

    No one will doubt that Mineralogy should be such an important branch of learning.
Minerals existed before man was thrust upon the scene ; they will possibly con-

tinue to exist long after he himself has passed awaj': at least as persistent as

himself, they will have an interest for every age.

     The Continental nations have not only long recognised the importance of
raineralogical study, but have acted accordingly. The difference between action

and inaction will be most clearly grasped if we compare the position of Mineralogy

in Germany with that in this country.
     In Freiberg, the centre of a mining district in Saxony, an institute was opened

in the year 17(J6 for the scientific training of those students whose interest was in
minerals, and the lectures on Mineralogy given there by Professor Werner became

a prominent feature ; of the many pupils of this remarkable man, Breithaupt,
Von Buch, Haidinger, Humboldt, Mohs, Naumann, and AVeiss may be especially

mentioned as having afterwards distinguished themselves by their scientific work.

Of other Germans, who have likewise gone to their rest after much labour given

to the advancement of Mineralogy and Crystallography, men wliose names will
long be household words for mineralogists, we may especially recall Beer, Bischof,

Blum, Credner, Hessel, Klaproth, Kobell, Lasaulx, 5litscherlich, Pfatt', Plattner,

Plucker, Quenstedt, Vom Rath, Beusch. Gustav Rose, Heinrich Rose, Ssdebeck,

Scheerer, Sartorius von "Waltershausen, Websky, and WiJhler. Of the many Ger-

mans who are now contributing to our knowledge of minerals it is an invidious

task to make a selection, but we may mention Arzruni, Bauer, Beckenkamp, Biick-

ing, Cathrein, Cohen, Goldschmidt, Groth, Ilaushofer, Hintze, Hirschwald, Klein,

Klockmann, Knop, Laspeyres, Lehmann, Liebiscli, Liidecke, Miigge,. Neumann,

Osann, Rosenbusch, Sandberger, Streng, Voigt, Weisbach and Zirkel : most of them

are  University  Professors  of                                            Mineralogy                                                        all of them hold important  positions  as

teachers of the subject. Further, the laboratories and instruments available for the

teaching of practical work are in many cases, notably at Strassburg, Munich, Gtit-

tingen, and Berlin, of an elaborate character.

     So  much  for  Germany                                                let  us  now                                                      look  at  home.  In the Universities of
                                                                        ;
--England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland there is a grand total of two Pro-

fessorships of Mineralogy, one of them at r'ambridge, the other, and younger one,

at Oxford. Further, the stipends are nearly as low as they can be made; in the

former case, according to the University Calendar, the stipend paid from the Uni-

versity Chest to tiie present holder of the olHce amounts to 300Z. a year; in the

more ancient but less extravagant University of Oxford, the Calendar states that

the present professor receives, subject to previous deduction of income-tax, the

annual sum of 100/., and the necessary instruments and many of the specimen.^

have presumably been provided from his private resources ; in case of residence he

is to be allowed another 150/. a year for the luxuries which University life involves.

And these are the only teaching appointments in his own subject that a successful

investigator of minerals can look forward to being a candidate for ! The result is

inevitable ; all those students who intend to earn their own livinfr, all those who feel
anxious to undertake professorial work, conclude that, however much they may

be interested in the investigation of the characters of minerals, they will do well

to follow the example of Professor Whewell and turn to other branches of knowledge

in which there is a more hopeful prospect of their studies meeting with practical

recognition.

     It cannot be expected that advanced Mineralogy will ever be able to command

the attention of more than a limited number of students, seeing that its successful

--pursuit requires a preliminary knowledge of at least three other sciences mathe-
--matics, physics, and chemistry sciences which must be assigned a fundamental

importance in any scheme of education                                                                                                                                                                                 if a preliminary knowledge of geology  can

be added, so much the better. Only few students can find time in their undergraduate

days to acquire a competent knowledge of these sciences and to proceed afterwards

to the study of Mineralogy. Bat the comparatively flourishing condition of the

science in German}', France, and other countries indicates that this is not a

sufficient reason for refraining from giving proper facilities and encouragement to

those who wish to enter upon its study. Some years ago the University of

Cambridge took a step in the right direction, and introduced Mineralogy into their

examinational system in such a way that the students of Physics, Chemistry, and

Geology can give time to the acquisition of a knowledge of Crystallography and

Mineralogy, and obtain credit for that knowledge in the examination for a degree.

It is clear that if in the future there is to be an honourable rivalry between

this and other countries in the advancement of the knowledge of minerals, each of

our Universities should be enabled in some way or other to found Professorships

of Mineralogy, and be prevailed upon to follow the example of Cambridge in en-

couraging the students of Physics, Chemistry, and Geology to acquire a knowledge

of Crystallography and Mineralogy before their education is regarded as complete.

Even where a student has no intention of devoting himself to advanced mineral-

ogical study, an elementary knowledge of Crystallography and iNlinevalogy will be

extremely useful in giving him a better grasp of his own special subject.
    And if, perchance, any of you are anxious to reduce the amount of those un-

mentionable duties of which we have heard so much of late, and feel that you can

best do this by the endowment of Professorships of Mineralogy in our Universities,

I would advise you not to do what has been so long practicable at this Association,

--couple Mineralogy with any other science that would be an unwise economy.

Each of the sciences is now so vast in its extent that no professor can be thoroughly

master of what has been done, and is now being done, by other workers, in more

than one of them. I remember that in my younger days it was held by some at

Oxford that the Professor of Mineralogy, a so-called subordinate subject, should

continue to be paid o'l a lower scale than his brother professors, and that he should

obtain a living wage by adding a college tutorship or a lectureship in some other

subject to his professorial duties. It is not by the prospect of such appointments
that you can expect the most capable men to be attracted to the study of minerals.

The practical effect of such an arrangement would only be that a college lecturer

would give formal teaching in Mineralogy while devoting his real energy to

another subject in which the pupils are more numerous.

    It only remains to thank you for the way in which you have listened to a

technical address relative to a science for the study of which very few facilities

have been offered to you in our own country. Not often does the mineralogist

present himself before an audience; he sees only too clearly that

                         The applause of listening senates to command,
                        To read his history in a nation's eyes,
                           His lot forbids

but I shall not have broken the long silence in vain if I have made clear to you
that, though the Science of Mineralo<iy is itself making great progress, we have
hitherto given too little encouragement to its study in our own Universities, and
lag far behind both Germany and France in the recognition of its importance.

The following Papers and Report were read :

  1. Some Points of Special Interest in the Geology of the Neighbourhood

             of Oxford. By Professor A. H. Green, M.A., F.R.S.

     There are several spots around Oxford the names of which have come to be
household words in the literature of geology.

     It is not likely that I can add anything to what has been long known about

localities which were favourite haunts of Buckland, Phillips, and other of our
feremost geologists. But, as excursions to some of these places have been planned,
I hoped it might be serviceable to recall attention to the more important of the

specialities of these spots.

    We hope to visit historic Stonesfield. Work will be begun at some brick- and

ironstone-pits at Fawler, where the Liassic zones of Ammonites capricornus,
A, viargaritatiis. and A. spinatm are well shown. Above these comes an at-
tenuated representative of the Upper Lias, not more than 10 feet thick. The
basement bed, with its mixture of ammonites elsewhere relegated to separate
zones, which has been studied by Mr. Walford, is present. Above the Upper Lias

we have the representative of the Inferior Oolite, here reduced to the two bands of

                                             Chipping Norton Limestone.
                                              Clypeus Grit.

     The latter is referred to the Parkinsoni zone, the lower zones of the subformation
being here absent.* On the hill above lie the workings in the Stonesfield Slate,
with its mixture of terrestrial, fresh water, and marine forms, too well known to

need special description. Quarries may afterwards be visited in Great Oolite

(Upper Zone), Forest Marble, and Cornbrash, one of which shows a curious case of
contemporaneous erosion.

    An excursion over Shotorer will show a succession from the Oxford Clay to

the Neocoraian Ironsands. One point of interest here is the little coral reefs of
the Corallian Beds, and tlie bank of finely comminuted material, derived from
their wear, which adjoins them.^ The Portland Beds are sandy and shingly, and
mark the margin of the southern Portlandian sea.

     The Neocomian Ironsands are part of a long strip which runs from Wiltshire,
through Oxfordshire and Bedfordshire, to Cambridgeshire and onwards. They

are coarse, shingly, very current-bedded, obviously shore deposits. Possibly they
were formed in a long strait that connected the northern and southern Neocomian

basins. At most of the spots where they yield fossils, these are marine. But it
is only natural that, as we go along a coast line where the physical conditions

change from place to place, there should be a corresponding change in the

character and fossils of the deposits. And it is so here. On a hill adjoining
Shotover the Ironsands have long been known to contain fresh-water fossils.

We are here facing what was the mouth of a river. At Faringdon, again, the

beds depart widely from their normal type. There is no current bedding, indeed
very little bedding at all. Their abundant fossils include sponges, most of which
are very perfect, and delicate bryozoa but little worn, with scattered specimens
of perfect brachiopods, all embedded in a matrix of very finely comminuted

organisms. These facts seem to me to point to a tract of still water such as

would be found in a sheltered bay. In the deeper water of the centre the fossils
would be preserved entire, while over the shallow margins they would be ground
small, and the finely comminuted matter swept into the central pit till it was

filled up.

    An interesting section occurs in a brick-pit near Culham. It shows
    3. G ault clay, with a band at the bottom containing sand, pebbles, and rolled

fossils derived from the Neocomian Ironsands.
     2. Thin band of earthy limestone ; Kimmeridgian (?) or Portlandian.

The Neocomian Ironsands are in full force hard by ; at thia spot they have

been denuded before the Gault was deposited, and their ruins have accumulated

towards the base of that subformation.

The Purbeck and Portland rocks of the Swindon outlier have been so often

described that they need no special notice.^ The shell-marks and tufaceous lime-

stones of the Purbeck lie in a hollow worn out in the Portland rocks, and the
Atwo are most sharply marked off from each other.
                                                   limestone crowded with

Cerithtum Portlandicum marks the upper limit of the Portland. It has been

irregularly denuded, and here and there small isolated blocks, which have escaped

denudation, project up into the Purbeck. The Portlands have a shingly character

in some beds, which must have been formed in shallow water.

       3. On the Terraced Hill Slopes of North Oxfordshire.
                    By Edwin A. Walpoed, F.G.S.

The green slopes of many of the minor vales of North Oxfordshire are scored with

parallel terraces or terraced banks, frequently of such regularity in depth of step

and slope as to present to the mind any other origin for their formation than that

of the every-day work of natural forces. They have been described as camps,

entrenchments, and amphitheatres, and those of other districts Mr. Gomme has

described, and has cited the many theories of their origin.

     Mr. Walfovd first drew attention to the Oxfordshire and Warwickshire terraced

fields in 1886,^ and dealt at greater length with the subject in 1890.^

    He gives as causes of formation

1. The downward creep of the surface and sub-surface soil.

     2. The occurrence of the terraces upon one precise geologic line, the micaceous
marls of the Middle Lias which come in below the Red Rock bed. The marls are
porous and non-cohesive. On the slippery slopes the soil must creep. The rain and
rain-wash loosen the light soil below and about the roots of the herbage and urge
its movement downward. Terraces from an incipient stage, like an ordinary grass

ridge, to minor and major terraced banks of varying regularity of form can be

traced. Below these marls are depths of compact blue clay (the zone of Ammonites

Amargaritatus if in near contact with the marls).  little below the point where

the marls and clays meet is the line of water outflow. Along the line there is
constant removal of marl by chemical and mechanical solution. The effect is the
loosening and sliding of the land downwards and outwards. This movement is

aided by the weight of the overlying mass of rock, sometimes twenty-five feet in

thickness.

     3. Free passage of water through the rock and marl is necessary, for the Upper
liias clays have, on the Oxfordshire terraced hills, either been wholly stripped from

the hill top or pushed back by atmospheric denudation. Regularly terraced slopes

are not found on clay-covered hills ; the appearance of terraces is coincident with

the wearing away of the clay ' roof.'
     The amphitheatre form of terraced land is always a valley head. The outflow

-- --of the stream the valley-maker marks ordinarily the base of the amphitheatre.

More frequently the terraces of the valley head are small in step and their curvature

is broken. Such an instance is Kenhill, near Shennington. An instance of

greater regularity of curvature and greater depth of step is the Beargarden, Ban-

bury.

6ie REPORT-- 1894.

·J From the Edge Hill escarpment a fork of the Horton vale runs alongside
Adsum Plantation, and makes what is knowJi as Adsum Hollow. The terraces

sweep in regular curves along the high banks of the stream, and where it joins the
main vale to the North of Horley the steps are so prominent as to give the name

of Steps Meadow to the ground. Grtdenton Hill, on the Burton Darrett range, is

very regularly and beautifully terraced on three sides.
  . The author does not attempt description of the chalk hills or the lynchets of

Dorsetshire. The sandy marls of the Dorsetshire Inferior Oolite have a composi-
tion approaching that of the micaceous marls of the Midlands, and reasons like
those brought forward will no doubt prove their similar mode of formation.

, The Probable Range of the Coal-Measures under the Newer Rocks of

   Oxfordshire and the Adjoining Counties. By Professor Boyd

   Dawkins, F.R.S.

The principle laid down by Godwin-Austen and Prestwich that the master

or tectonic folds in the pre-Carboniferous and Carboniferous rocks are lines of

weakness along which the newer rocks have been folded in later times, has been

recently applied by Bertrand to the district of northern France. In the present

communication the author proposes to see how far it can be used in the search

after the buried coal-fields of the counties of O.xford, Buckingham, Berks, and

Wilts.

From the relation existing between the tectonic anticlines and synclines in the

districts of South Wales, Gloucester, and the West of England, where they can

be studied at the surface in the Palteozoic rocks, most important conclusions may

be drawn as to the coal-fields buried under the newer rocks in southern England,

They are as follows :

1. The Mid-Devon syncline, traceable eastwards until it cuts the sea-line near

Bognor.

2. The North Devon anticline, which runs eastwards through the Vale of

Wardour, past Salisbury, and along the anticline of the Weald from Petersheld

to Dungeness.

3. The Mid-Somerset syncline, which sweeps eastwards through the Vale of

Bridgewater and Glastonbury, through the chalk downs between Heytesbury and
Hindon, to Haslemere. From this point it is continued to the east through

Tunbridge Wells and Tenterden to the sea to the south of Hythe.

     These three folds have no bearing on the range of the coal-fields in the drainage
area of the Thames. The fourth, or Pembroke-Mendip anticline, and tlie tifih,
or South Welsh syncline, are the two great tectonic folds which remain for

consideration.

     The Pembroke-Mendip anticlinal range, highly faulted and folded, is traceable
westwards into South Ireland, and eastwards, through Pembroke and the peninsula

of Gower, to the south of Cardifl', through Weston-super-Mare and the Mendip

Hills. Throughout this area it forms the southern margin of the coal-fields.
Near Frome it plunges beneath the Oolites. It is, however, clearly marked by

the Upper Greensand anticline of the Vale of Pewsey, and by the Upper Green-

Hamsand inliers of     and Kiugsclere. Thence it passes along the line to the

high downs past Basingstoke and Faruham to Peasemarsh, south of Guildford,

where it is seen in an inlier of Weald clay. It is carried still further to the east

by similar inliers south of Westerham, and at Wateringbury and Maidstone.

From Maidstone it sweeps to the south-east, through Otham and Ashford,

arriving at the coast close to Hythe. In the eastern portion of its course it has,

in my opinion, been the chief factor causing the south-eastern trend of the North
Downs in the district of Maidstone. It forms also the southern boundary of the

South-eastern coal-field discovered in the boring at Dover, and of the coal-fields of

northern France and Belgium.

The South Welsh syncline, only two miles wide at St. Bride's Bay, in the

anthracite district of Pembroke, widens out into the coal-field of South Wales,
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  647

twenty miles in width. As it approaches the upper eStuaty of the Severn it is

represented by the outlying coal-tield of the Forest of Dean, and the three par-

tially or wholly covered fields to the north of the Mendip Hills, distributed through
an area measuring forty-five miles from north to south. The wedge-like syncline, with

its more or less connected coal-fields, continues to widen eastwards, its northern

boundary being probably represented by a line drawn from the northern rim of

the South Welsh coal-fi"eld to the north of the Forest of Dean, and continued due
I'ast beneath the Secondary and Tertiary rocks to some point between Walton-on-

the-Naze and the mouth of the Blackwater. It passes through Gloucester,

Eissington, in the valley of the Windrush, Blenheim, Kirtlington, Quainton,

Luton, Bishop's Stortford, Dunmow, Braintree, and Colchester. The width of

this great tectonic syncline between Colchester and Dover is about fifty miles,
and it occupies nearly the whole of the London Tertiary basin, which, it must be

noted, is of the same wedge shape, wideniog to the east.
     The boring recently described by Mr. AVhitaker at Culford, near Bury

St. Edmunds, in which a slate rock, probably of Silurian or pre-Silurian age, was

struck at a depth of G37 feet G inches from the surface, shows that in all probability

that area is an anticlinal area. About forty -two miles to the south, in the deep boring

at Harwich, the Yoredale shales come in. Both these points are, be it remarked,

to the north of the line in question. Both indicate a Palreozoic area in Suffolk
and northern Essex older than the Coal-Measures, and similar to that on the same

meridian in South Wales and Gloucestershire which lies to the north of the

Wewestern coal-fields.  have, therefore, not merely a well-defined Pembroke-

Mendip anticline forming the southern boundary of the coal-fields both in the

west and in the east, as proved by the south-eastern coal-field at Dover, but also

evidence of the continuation of the South Welsh pre-Carbonilerous barrier of

Hull, which forms the northern boundary of the visible coal-fields due eastwards

into Suffolk. It may therefore be reasonably inferred that similar coal-fields,

isolated from each other by tracts of older rocks, are to be found in the South

Welsh syncline where it lies buried beneath the Secondary and Tertiary strata.

In other words, we may conclude that there are coal-fields in North Wilts, in the
counties of Berk.s, Oxford, and Buckingham, and the Tertiary basin of the Thames

within the limits laid down above, and in a direction indicated in 1871 by the

Coal Commissioners.

One such coal-field, indeed, has already been discovered in a deep boring at

Burford, near AVhitney, in the valley of the Windrush. The discovery, however,
has unfortunately not been followed up, and we do not know whether it is of wide
<;ast and west range, similar to that of South Wales, or of Bethune and Namur, oi-

whether it is small and unimportant, like some of the smaller coal-basins north of

the Mendip Hills. It ofl'ers a sure basis for other deep borings, which may have

the same industrial effect on Oxfordshire as those which have extended the range

of the buried Coal-Measures in northern France, ninety miles to the west of

Charleroi, and converted a purely agricultural into a great manufacturing district.

There is no practical difficulty arising from the depth at which the Coal-Measures

may be expected to occur in this region. At Burford they were struck at

1,184 feet from the surface, and at Dover at 1,113 feet below high-water mark.

The borings in the area of the London Tertiaries prove that the Palfeozoic rocks are

not buried to'a greater depth than about 1,200 feet below sea-level, and in Hertford-

shire to as little as 796 feet. The most important collieries in England are carried

on at depths ranging from 1,500 to more than 3,000 feet.
     The new light thrown upon the question of the buried coal-fields by recent dis-

coveries places it in a very difi'erent position from that which it occupied in 1871,
when Godwin-Austen, Prestwich, and Hull gave their evidence before the Ivoyal

Commission. The boring at Dover, revealing the existence of a valuable coal-field,
now offers a fixed point for further discovery in south-eastern England. That at
Burford ofi'ers a similar basis for the proving of the Oxfordshire coal-tield. The many
other wells and borings made in the area of London, and as far north as Bury St.

Edmunds, also afibrd important information as to the northern boundary of the

productive South W^elsh syncline. The development of our mineral wealth is of

such vast importance that it would be quite worth the while of the GoTernment to
undertake a serieB of experimental borings, which would indicate the exact position

of the buried coal-fields. In the present state of the mining laws it is a task not
likely to be undertakpn by the private adventurer. It might, however, be carried
out by the County Councils, or by a combination of landowners, either with or
without a compulsory rate, on the property which would be benefited by the

discovery of new fields. It is one of those objects of public utility which are
especially worthy of the regard of the British Association at this time and in thi»

place.

5. On the Deposit of Iron Ore in the Soring at Shakespeare Cliff", Dove?:
                      By Professor Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S.

The general results of the boring at Dover were laid before the British Associa-

tion at Cardiff" in 1892, so far as relates to the discovery of the south-eastern coal-

field. In the present communication the author treats of a bed of ironstone, which

quantities.

     The ironstone presents very singular physical characters. It is composed of

in a crystalline base partly of calcium carbonate, and partly of iron carbonate.
These grains are oolitic in structure, and are probably the result of the same chemi-
cal change by which the calcareous beds of the Inferior Oolite in Lincolnshire have
been converted into the iron ores. They occur, it will be noted, in several strata
above the main bed, 12 feet in thickness in the above section.

     This bed of iron ore is identical with that described by Blake and Hudleston at
Abbotsbury in Dorset, where it occurs between the Kimmeridge clay above and

the Corallian rocks below.

     It is also physically identical with the valuable iron ore worked for many years
at "VVestbury in Wiltshire, where it is met with at a lower horizon, being there

separated from the Corallian limestones by 4 feet of marls and sands.
      This stratum, although probably of purely local origin, is to be looked for in the

beds above the Corallian throughout the whole of southern England, from Dorset
eastwards. Its discovery at Dover is only second in importance to that of the
South-eastern Coal-field. It will have to be taken into account in the future
development of the coal-fields in southern England.

      6. On the Cause of Earthqiiakes. By J. Logan Lobley, F.G.S.,

                Professor of Physiography, City of London College.

     Although a connection between the cause of volcanic and of seismic action is-
generally assumed, neither has been satisfactorily determined, though both are
usually attributed in their inception to a shrinkage of the globe from secular cool-
ing. The author took exception to this view, and adduced the great amount of rock-
folding since the Cambrian Period, as showing that if this were due to planetary-
shrinkage, which rock-folding is assumed to prove, the earth's radial contraction
must have been at least 100 miles during post-Cambrian ages, that such a contractiort
would require a loss of heat to the extent of 5,000° F., that therefore the globe-
would have had at the Cambrian Period a temperature 5,000° F. higher than
at present, and that such a temperature was altogether incompatible with terres-
trial conditions. Neither, apart from greater terrestrial heat, would meteorological
conditions be at all like the present, with a surface 100 miles further from the
centre, for an attenuated atmosphere and difl'erent gravities would afl'ect all
climatal conditions and all the agencies of nature.

     Both the petrological and the palteontological teachings of the Cambrian rocks
are entirely at variance with any such conditions, since they indicate terrestrial
inorganic conditions and agencies similar to those of the present epoch.

     It was submitted, therefore, that the assumption of a planetary shrinkage waa
opposed to geological facts, and that consequently another cause must be sought
for seismic phenomena.

     The author thought the hypothesis he brought before the Section in 1888 ta
account for volcanic action ' would meet the difficulty, and expressed the opinion
that earthquakes were originated by chemical action arising from favouring
physical conditions at separate and isolated dynamic foci, at moderate depths and
quite unconnected with any central fused mass. These originating foci, like those-
of both volcanic and plutonic action, were in a thin outer rind of the globe of a
few miles in thickness, which with all its foldings and plications rested upon a
solid foundation, giving the earth its ascertained rigidity, and since the Cam-
brian Period there has been no appreciable decrease of the bulk of the globe or of

terrestrial heat.

         7. On Certain Volcanic Subsidences in the Worth of Iceland.
                   By Tempest Anderson, M.D., B.Sc, F.G.S.

     Perliaps the most striking features in Icelandic scenery are the gids (pronounced
*geow'),or fissures and chasms which are so frequently met with in all the districts
in which recent volcanic activity manifests itself. They are usually, and in most
cases rightly, ascribed to the lower stratum of a molten lava stream having obtained
an outlet after the surface has consolidated into a crust of greater or less thickness.

      Gias of this class are, so far as the author has been able to observe, confined
within the limits of a single lava stream, and do not aifect previously formed rocks.
Usually there is a large gia roughly parallel with each side of the original lava

stream, and the space between these has subsided considerably. Any gias in this
subsided portion are much smaller, and obviously of secondary importance.

E.tamples of this are to be found in the well-known Almanagia, at Thingvalla,
which has a throw of about 100 feet, while the sides of the smaller gias which
enclose the Logberg in the subsided portion are practically^on the same level.

     There are also several such subsidences near Lon and Asbergi, in the North of
Iceland. The main subsidence at Asbergi is a little more compUcated, though
evidently due to the same causes. Here a large roughly triangular area has sub-
sided, the throw at the apex being probably nearly 300 feet, but a space in the
middle has remained at its original height, so that a depression has been produced
like a great V> the portions both between and outside the legs having remained
standing. In the case of Thingvalla it appears not unlikely that the lava which
flowed down into the lake solidified on coming in contact with the water and
formed a wall sufficiently strong to hold up the lava plain till it formed a firm
crust, and that the giving way of this and the escape of the molten lower layers

into the deeper parts of the lake caused the^subsidence.

    Similarly the lava which escaped from Asbergi may have been that which now

occupies the low ground near the estuary of the Jokulsa, in the direction of Lon.

    On the east and south-east of Lake Myvatn a very extensive eruption, or series of

eruptions, has taken place from a chain of craters locally called Gardr Borgir (' the

castles of Gardr,' which is the name of a farm). The lava How has occupied nearly
all the bed of Lake Myvatn, and flowed down the valley of the Laxa to its mouth
at Laxamyri. All this stream of lava is very remarkable for the number and size

of the spiracles with which it is studded, and a regular gradation of sizes exists,
between spiracles the size of a haycock and cones some of which cannot be less
than 200 feet high. These cones and craters, which constitute such a striking

feature of Lake Myvatn, may probably be nothing more than spiracles formed by

the escape of steam generated by the contiict of the hot lava witli the water of the
lake. The barrier which holds up the water of the present lake consists of this
lava, and caves exist in it which are obviously channels by which molten lava has
escaped. These and deeper-seated ones would be those by which the lava escaped
and left the depression occupied by the present lake. Between the craters of
eruption and the lake no spiracles were noticed, but there is a very remarkable

--series of rocks--the Dimmuborgir masses of lava of fantastic shape, 30 or 40 feet

high, which have remained standing while the intervening portions have subsided.
They present slickenside marks where the subsiding portions have scratched the
masses that have remained standing, and tide-marks where the crust has halted in
its descent ; also in many places bulgings, where the lava has been scarcely stiff
enough to stand, and others where it has actually formed stalactitic masses.

      So far for actual lava subsidences.
     The special object of this paper is to draw attention to a subsidence on the
slopes of Leirnukr, a volcano several miles north of Myvatn, where a large strip
of land, perhaps 200 yards wide and one mile or more long, has been let down to a
varying depth, averaging perhaps 60 to 80 feet.
     The faults bounding it, like nearly all the fissures in this district, run north
and south ; and the east face, which is most perfect, cuts right through a thick
stream of old columnar lava and through a large boss of tuft', round and over which
the lava has bedded itself, and also through the tuff' rocks at each side of the lav*
                                                                                                        ·

               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                             651

stream. It would appear worthy of consideration whether this great depression,

which thus afi'ects all the crust of the volcano impartially, may not have been
caused by the falling in of one of the steam cavities which may be presumed to

exist under volcanoes after the lavas have been expelled by the steam pressure.
     This would accord with the observation that sedimentary rocks near volcanoes

often dip towards those volcanoes. Mr. Goodcbild has informed the author that

the sedimentary roclis round Arthur's Seat are much thicker the nearer they are
to that old volcano, as if the ground had slowly sunk while they were being

deposited.

     Near Ldn the author was shown a small gia, said to have been formed
during an earthquake in February 1885. The crack was of a freshness correspond-
ing to such a date, and was only a few inches wide, and so short that it could not
bo determined whether it extended beyond one bed of lava. It certainly was not
an example of the escape of liquid lava from below a crust, nor of a subsidence
over a steam cavity, and its chief interest in this connection is as showing that at
least three separate sets of causes are at work in producing the giils of Iceland.

                              FRIDAY, AUGUST 10.

   A1. joint discussion with Section 11 on the Plateau Gravels, &c., West Kent,

--was opened by the following two communications :

(a) On the Geology of the Plateau Implements in Kent}
       By Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., F.G.S.

This subject having been fully treated of by Professor Dr. Prestwich, the

requisite references to his various memoirs elucidating the general geology of the

local drift-deposits, the geological stages of their formation, and the peculiar flint

implements of the plateau were given. He has shown that certain superficial soils

on the North Downs between Sevenoaks and Ilochester contain numerous rudely

worked flints, discovered by Mr. B. Harrison ; and that these were derived from

a gravel, of very great antiquity, originally formed on the side of the old Wealden

Hill-range or Mountain, which once rose about 3,000 feet above where Crow-

borough and other hills in Sussex now are. Man existed at the time of these

gravels, and used the flints for tools. These gravels and the implements left in

them were removed by natural agencies, such as rain, rivers, sea, frost, snow, and ice,

and distributed by torrential streams on the Chalk slopes (now part of the North

Downs) at a lower level on the flanks of the range.

Tliese rude old flint implements have an ochreous colouring, due to ferruginous

gravel whence  they came                                                       and  are  now found  on     the  plateau, sometimes with
                                                                            ;

limited patches of some of the ochreous flint gravel, together with Tertiary

pebbles, less-worn flints, and fragments of Lower Greensand, on the red ' clay-

with-tiiuts' covering the Chalk. It was shown how desirable systematic excava-

tions, to prove the extent and thickness of the implementiferous soil, would be.

Professor Prestwich's history of the origin of the ancient Wealden Dome,

Island, and Hill-ranges, and of the gradual destruction of those uplands, in the

course of untold ages, with the resulting formation and removal of successive

geological groups of strata, such as the Thanet Sands, Woolwich-and-Reading

Beds, London Clay, Lenham Beds, and the old ferruginous gravel with its rude

implements above mentioned, was noticed in detail.

The Diestian or Lenham Beds were formed                                                  in         the Early Pliocene  period                        and
                                                                                                                                                   ;

the denudation of Holmesdale probably began directly afterwards, at about the

time of the Red or the Chillesford Crag in Late Pliocene, or in Post -Pliocene

times ; and the old ferruginous gravel had not only been formed, but washed

away to a lower level before that time.

    The ultimate denudation of the Talleys cutting off the Chalk from the Weald
being subsequent to the formation and removal of that gravel, the latter must have

been Pre-glacial in age.

 (b) On the Age of the Plateau Beds. By W. "Whitakee, F.R.S., F.G.S.

     Mr. Whitaker said that the flints exhibited might be divided into two classes, the

few that would be allowed by every qualified observer to be the work of mau and
the many as to the authenticity of which judgment should be deferred. He then
alluded to the two points of view from which the subject was approached, the
anthropological and the geological. In the former the work of man was the

starting point ; but, as a geologist, he thought that Nature should be duly con-

sidered, and the varied way in which she worked, sometimes leading to results
that were somewhat unexpected. The district in question, too, was of a double
character. In the first place, we had to do with a tract, south of the Chalk range,
over which there were in parts beds of gravel, sometimes along the courses of the

stream-valleys, but sometimes having no connection with the present drainage-
system. In the latter case the composition and position of the gravel seemed to

point to a time when the features of the country were not the same as now, when
the streams ran in different courses, and when the Chalk escarpment and other

similar ranges of hill reached further south than now. He pointed out that the
district was at and near the watershed between the Medway and the Darent, and

that in such a position alterations in the flow of streams could be brought about

by smaller causes than lower down along the river-valleys. The other part of the
district was along and north of the great Chalk range, and the deposit here mostly
met with over the Chalk could not properly be called Drift ; it had not been brought
into its present position from elsewhere by sea, river, or ice, but had grown where
it stood ; it was a residuum, the matter left from long-continued gradual dissolu-
tion of the chalk and the leaving behind of its flints and other insoluble matter,
to which was added a mass of loam, resulting presumably from the remains of old
Tertiary beds. "With regard to the gi-avels, flint implements of undoubted work-
manship having been found in them, it must be conceded that man existed at the
time of the deposition of those gravels. This certainly carried man back, locally
at all events, beyond the time of the river gravels, which occur in the bottoms and

along the slopes of the valleys. He could not admit, however, that there was any
good evidence to connect these ancient men with Pre-glacial or even with Glacial

times, as there were no deposits of undoubted Glacial age in or near the district.

Over the Clay-with-flints of the Chalk tract many implements had been found, but
these were on the surface, and therefore we had no evidence of their age other
than that given by their form. He understood that it had been said that a very
few implements had been found in the Clay ; but even were it so we should be

little wiser as to their age, the formation of this clay having continued over a long

time, right down to the present day. Elsewhere implements had been found in a
brickearth that was associated with the Clay-with-flints ; but in this case we were

still ignorant of the age of the deposit, no other bed having been found above.

He thought that in such a matter great caution was needed lest observers should

be carried away by their zeal in discovery, and that the right spirit was to approach
the question with wholesome doubt, contesting the views of those whose faith led
them to believe very ordinary-looking chippings to be the work of design, so that
they should have to prove that the balance of probabilities was in favour of their

view.

2. On the Traces of Two Rivers helonging to Tertiary Time in the Inner-
                  Hebrides. By Sir Aechibald Geikie, F.R.S.

     Many years ago the author had described part of the course of a stream which
had cut its channel in the lava-plateau of the Isle of Eigg, and, as shown by the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                               653

materials of its gravel deposits, had flowed from east to west. The channel of

the main river, as well as those of some of its tributaries, had been sealed up

under a flow of pitchstone, which, after ages of waste, now forms, owing to its

greater durability, the prominent ridge of the Scuir, the original higher ground of

bedded basalt having been worn down into lower slopes. The river-course thus

entombed must be assigned to the volcanic period of older Tertiary time in this

country. Its western end is truncated by a precipitous sea-cliff, at the top of

which a section of it is displayed, with its underlying shingle and overlying pitch-

stone, at a height of some 500 feet above the sea. This summer the author had

enjoyed a favourable opportunity of visiting Hysgeir, a small low islet about

eighteen miles to the west of Eigg, which had recently been identified by Professor

Heddle as a continuation of the rock of the Scuir. He was able completely to

corroborate this identification. The pitchstone of Hysgeir in its external forms

and internal structure precisely resembles that of Eigg, presenting, indeed, so close

a resemblance that it looks like a detached piece of the high ridge of the Scuir.

Unfortunately, the columnar rock everywhere slips under the sea, and allows no

trace to be seen of what it rests upon. If it be approximately as thick as it is in

Eigg, its base may be 200 or 300 feet below sea-level. The gradual fell of the

river-bed from east to west had been noticed at the Scuir, and the position of the

pitchstone at Hysgeir showed a continued declivity in the same direction of

perhaps as much as 35 feet in the mile. No visible rock rises to the surface of

the sea between Hysgeir and Eigg. The region has been intensely glaciated, and

the low ridge and rocky slopes of Hysgeir are strewn with erratics, which show

that the ice moved westwards from the Inverness-shire highlands.

A much older river, but one still belonging to the volcanic period, has left

Asome interesting records in the islands lying to the north of Hysgeir.  succession

of coarse river-gravels are there found intercalated on different horizons among

the bedded basalts. The materials of the lowest of these conglomerates are

remarkably coarse, blocks 6 feet in length being occasionally visible. They con-

sist in large measure of volcanic rocks, especially slaggy and amygdaloidal

varieties. These constitute the largest and least water-worn blocks. Pieces of

Torridon sandstone, epidotic grit, quartzite, and various granites and schists' are

generally well-rounded and smooth, and especially abound in the finer and more

stratified gravels. The rapid dying out of thick sheets of coarse conglomerate is a

conspicuous feature of the deposits, their place being sometimes taken by layers of

fine tuff" or volcanic mudstone, or by shales with remains of land-plants. Some

portions of the conglomerate pass into true volcanic agglomerate, and this latter

rock can in one place be seen to rise as a neck enclosing blocks of scorise and basalt

sometimes 15 feet in length.

The sequence of events which these various deposits indicate appears to be aa

follows. During the outpouring of the lavas of the great basaltic plateaux of the

Inner Hebrides a river flowed across the volcanic plain from the Western High-

lands, whence it carried large quantities of shingle. By successive violent floods

these materials, togetlier with the detritus of the lava-fields, were strewn irregu-

larly far and wide beyond the immediate channel of the river. In the pools

left behind, fine volcanic silt gathered and entombed leaves and stems of the

surrounding terrestrial vegetation. But volcanic activity still continued, and,

though cones of slags and pumice were swept down, new eruptions took place by

which masses of rock, sometimes 9 feet in diameter, were thrown out to a distance

of a mile or more, and fresh streams of lava were poured out, completely burying

the previous accumulations. Renewed river-floods of gradually lessening severity

spread fine detritus over the cooled sheets of basalt, and again these later fluviatile

deposits were entombed beneath fresh outbursts of lava. Perhaps no more

striking evidence can be elsewhere obtained of the conditions of the land-surface

over which, from many scattered vents, the materials of the volcanic plateaux of

the Inner Hebrides were slowly piled up.

3. On a New Method of Measuring Crystals, and its Ajjplication to the
    Measurement of the Octahedron Angle of Potash Alum and Amvionia
    Alum. By H. A. Miers, 3f.A., F.G.S.

  --The two fundamental laws of crystallography namely, (1) the constancy of the
--angle in crystals of the same substance, and (2) the law of simple rational indices

seem to be violated by those crystals which are liable to irregular variations in
their angles, or those which have the simple faces replaced by complicated ' vicinal

planes.

     Both these anomalies are exhibited by potash and ammonia alum. Brilliant
and apparently perfect octahedra of these salts show large variations in the octa-
hedron angle ; other crystals show low vicinal planes in place of the octahedron

faces.

      If it be trne, as is supposed, that the octahedron angle varies in different
crystals, it would be interesting to ascertain whether progressive variations can be
traced during the growth of a single crystal, and whether some or all of the octa-

hedron faces change their direction in space it the crystal be held fixed during

growth.

     In order to solve this problem a new goniometer has been constructed, in which

the crystal is fixed at the lower end of a vertical axis, so that it can be immersed

in a liquid during measurement.
      This device is in reality an inversion of the ordinary goniometer with horizontal

disc; the liquid is contained in a rectangular glass trough with parallel-plate sides;
one side is placed rigidly perpendicular to the fixed collimator, and the other is

perpendicular to the telescope, which is set at 90° to the collimator. The trough is
supported on a table which can be raised and lowered, so that the crystal can be
placed at any required depth in the liquid. If the liquid used be its own concen-
trated solution the crystal can be measured during growth, and the changes of

angle, if any, can be observed at diflerent stages.

     In order that it may be held rigidly, the cry.stal is mounted, when small, in a

platinum clip, which it envelops as it grows larger.

   --The results derived from the measurement of a large number of alum crystals

are as follow :

     (1) The faces of the regular octahedron are never developed upon alum growing
from aqueous solution.

     (2) The reflecting planes (which are often verj' perfect) are those of a very flat
triangular pyramid (triakis octahedron) which overlies each octahedron face,

     (3) The three faces of this triangular pyramid may be very unequal in size.
     (4) The triakis octahedron which replaces one octahedron face may be diflerent

from that which replaces another octahedron face upon the same crj'stal.
      (5) During the growth of the crystal the reflecting planes change their mutual

inclinations; the triakis octahedron becomes in general more acute, z'.c, deviates
further from the octahedron which it replaces, as the crystal grows.

      (6) This change takes place not continuously, but jjer saltum, each reflecting
plane becoming replaced by another which is inclined at a small angle (generally

about three minutes) to it.
     (7) During growth the faces are always those of triakis octahedra ; if, owing

to rise of temperature, re-solution begins to take place, faces of icositetrahedra are

developed.

                                                                   Conclusions,

     The above observations prove that the growth of an alum crystal expresses an
ever-changing condition of equilibrium between the crystal and the mother liquor.
It does not take place by the deposition of parallel plane layers ; new faces are

constantly develop d : since these succeed one another ^)er saltum they doubtless
obey the law of riUional indices, though not that o( simple rational indices.

     From the mutual inrlinatioLS of these vicin-al faces it is possible to calculate
with absolute accuiacy the angle of the faces to which they symmetrically approxi-
mate. This angle is found to be that of the regular octahedron, 70° 31 1'. The
                                                                                                                   ;

                                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.       655

octahedron angle of alum is not, therefore, as appeared from the ohser rations of
PfalF and Brauns, subject to any variation.

     The angle at which a given vicinal plane is inclined to the octahedron face is
independent of the area of the plane, and of the temperature of the solution and
of the barometric pressure : it appears to be conditioned by the concentration of

the solution at the surface of the plane.
     In confirmation of this view it is found that the upper and lower portions of an

octahedron face which stands vertical are often replaced by two different triangular
pyramids also that the three faces of one such pyramid are at a given moment

                                                      ;

not necessarily equally inclined to the octahedron face which it replaces.

     When, as is often the case, one of the three vicinal planes is large and the
other two are too small to give a visible reflexion, the face appears to be a single
reflecting plane. It is this which has been mistaken for the octahedron face in

previous observations.

     Similar phenomena of growth are exhibited by crystals of other substances
belonging to different systems. The conditions of equilibrium between the crystal

and the solution are such that vicinal planes appear in place of simple forms
these vary with the concentration of the solution, and give rise to variations in the
measured angles which are only apparently anomalous. Their true position can be
determined on a crystal of cubic symmetry (such as alum) whose theoretical angles
are known.

   A further study of the faces developed during the growth of crystals will, it is

hoped, lead to a better understanding of the reasons why a simple face like the

octahedron should not be a surface of equilibrium, and of the relation between
the vicinal planes and the structure of the crystal.

4. A Compaj'isoii of the Pebbles in the Trias of Budleigh Salterton and of
    Cannock Chase. By Professor T. G. Boxney, D.Sc, LL.D., F.R.S.

The pebbles in the two deposits correspond in certain respects. In both vein

quartz and various quartzites are abundant, with certain dark green rocks, which

undoubtedly in some, probably in most, cases owe their colour to minute
tourmaline. The compact quartzites so common in Staffordshire are found in the

Devonshire deposit, but less abundantly, while other quartzites more rare in the
Aformer are commoner in the latter.
                                                                                  quartz-felspar grit like the Torridon

Sandstone occurs in both. The following are points of difference. The shape of

the Staffordshire pebbles is nearer to a prolate spheroid, that of the Devonshire to

an oblate one : igneous rocks are much rarer in the latter, and the compact

tourmaline rocks in the former. The author thinks that the pebbles at Budlei"-h

Salterton must have travelled from a more or less south-westerly quarter, and

that the frequent correspondence of materials indicates that somewhat similar

detrital rocks fringed the archoean rocks of the ancient western land in localities

far apart.

5. On a Soda-Felspar Rock at Dinas Head, North Coast of Cornwall.
                                By Howard Fox.

Dinas Head adjoins Trevose Head, four miles west of Padstow.

The base and foreshore of tlie headland appear to be entirely composed of

greenstone containing much calcite, probably an altered dolerite.

Between the greenstone and the slate, as well as interbedded with the slate,

occurs a rock which covers about an acre. It assumes various characters, all of

which contain nearly 10 per cent, of soda and from 044 to G6-6 of silica. The

compact varieties are crypto-crystalline, and might easily be mistaken for cherts.

The concretionary and spherulitic varieties show grains and blades of a felspar

which is doubtless albite. It varies in colour from creamy grey to light brown and

dark bluish-grey                                                                  it weathers white, and is often  studded with cavities filled with
                                                                               ;

rusty brown material containing crystallised quartz. This rusty-coloured material

occasionally weathers out as nodules 8-10 mm. in diameter, projecting 10-15 mm.

beyond the white surface of the rock. In other places this rock contains lenticles
and concretions of calcareous matter of considerable size, with concentric structures

around some of them. When interbedded with slate it is densely studded with

small rusty brown spots, sometimes irregular and sometimes of such forms as would
be yielded by rhombs ; they are undoubtedly pseudomorphs after carbonate. It has
in places all the appearance of a stratified rock, and is distinctly bedded. In one
locality this rock assumes a nodular form, with the outer edges composed of spheru-
lites varying from 2 to 10 mm. in diameter. The central portions of the spherules
are composed of crypto-crystalline material, the outer portions of radiating blades
or prisms of felspar, presumably albite. Ferric oxide is scattered through the rock
in irregular patches, in veins, or in radial streaks between the blades of felspar, or
occasionally it is almost wholl}' concentrated in the polygonal sutures formed by
the mutual interference of adjacent spherulites.

     The greenstone is posterior to and intrusive in this soda rock, and cuts across,
bends, and disorders its beds. Extreme crushing has in places altered the original
junction line, and thrust planes and fault breccias are seen. Quartz veins traverse
both rocks, but are more numerous in the soda rock.

     The slate is interbedded on the northern side of the headland with bands of
blue limestone, and is occasionally studded with ferruginous patches and nodules
in much the same way as the soda rock.

   A rock containing as much as 7'54 per cent of soda is said by Kayser to occur

as a contact product due to greenstone in the Ilartz. The question ariaes. Is this
Dinas Head rock an adinole or a soda felsite i.e., a keratophyre ? The presence
of ferriferous carbonates favours the theory of its being an altered sedimentary
roclv, whilst the spherulitic and concretionary structure favours the theory of its
being an igneous rock.

4. On the Homes and Migrations of the Earliest Forms of Animal Life
    as indicated by Recent Researches. By Heney Hicks, M.D., F.R.S.,

      F.G.S.

The author, after giving a history of the finding of zones of animal life at

lower and lower horizons in the Cambrian rocks during the past forty years,

referred to some recent evidence which points to the extension of similar forms of

life over very large areas. That there were many centres of dispersion in different

parts of the world seems certain                                                                                                                           but as the migrations of the forms found on each
                                                                                                                                                        ;

jside of the Atlantic seem to have taken place contemporaneously, the author believes

that the original home of these forms must have been at some point in the Atlantic

when that basin was much narrower than it is at present. The author then referred

to the evidence, showing a gradual development in these earlier forms of life, and

to some points bearing on the question of evolution.

5. On some Vertebrate Remains from the RhcEtic Strata of Britain. {Third
            Contribution.) By Montagu Browne, F.G.S. , F.Z.S.

                          Labteinthodontia.

     Parts of jaws and teeth of a Labyrinthodont Amphibian are found commonly,
though very imperfect, in the ' bone-bed' of Aust Clitf, Gloucestershire. So much

material has been accumulated that it may be as well to record that ten specimens

of the pre-maxilla--showing large ' tusks ' and a serial outer row of smaller teeth

are knovirn to the writer, four of which are in the Bristol Museum, where they are
labelled ' Jaws of Enaliosaurians,' and six others, from Aust and Westbury-on-
Severn, are in his own possession. One of these was sent as the ' scute of a reptile ;
and another, before its development from the matrix, was so much like a coprolite

as to lead to the inference that others may have been previously passed over. Of

the maxilla there are six large portions and several smaller ones, carrying both

large and small teeth of two distinct characters. Several large and many small

pieces represent the mandible, some, near the symphysis, showing large teeth. Of
teeth, both seated upon the bone and broken away, there are a great many examples

of all sizes. Five pieces are apparently portions of the palato-vomerine element,
carrying large and small teeth.

Between fifty and sixty specimens are fragments of the jaws, and there are
many specimens which are doubtless portions of the elements of the skull and of
Athe thoracic plates.
                          few portions of limb-bones are doubtfully referable to the

Labyrinthodontia.

The definite determination of the pre-maxilla, portions of the maxilla, man-

dible, and some other parts of the Labyrinthodontia, appears' to be a new' record for

the Rhfetic of Britain. No speculation is hazarded as yet as to the generic or

specific determination of these remains, as if not referable to Metopomurus (Meto-

pius) diagiiosticus,^ they appear to have affinities with Trtmatosaurus in the

character of the united or single pre-maxilla, and bv the large tusks being internal

to the serial mandibular  teeth                        on the other hand, the anterior or ' tusk ' teeth are
                                                    ;

large--some of them f in. in diameter--each with a correspondingly large pulp-

cavity, and although apparently simply plicated in the exserted portion, yet at the

extreme base the plications of the dentine are complex, and somewhat" resemble

those shown in the teeth of Mastodonsaurus Jiigeri as figured by Meyer.^

The presence of teeth of two characters--large or Labyrmthodont, and small or

' Saurichthyan '--in the same jaws, together with the characters of the external

surface and alveolar palatal extension of the maxilla and of sections thereof, leads

to the conclusion, hinted at in the last Report under the heading of Termat.osaurus

crocodilinus,^ that ' Saurichtkys' is a non-existent piscine genus, and that jaws

specimens since that time, and it may be as well to put on record that some few

nearly perfect examples of dorsal and other vertebrae, and many portions of others,

of the character of those attributed to Rysosteus Oweni," have been procured by the

writer from Aust Cliff and Westbury-on-8evern, Gloucestershire.

6. On some Forms of Saurian Footprints from the Cheshire Trias}
                           By Osmund W. Jeffs.

The picturesque quarries in the Lower Keuper (building stones' series), situated

at Storeton Hill in Cheshire, have long been familiar to geologists as being the

scene of the earliest discovery in England of the famous Cheirotherium footprints by

Messrs. Cunningham and Yates in 1839. Besides the impressions of Cheirotherium

and Rhyjicosaurus (figured by Mr. G. H. Morton, F.G.S., in his ' Geology of the

Country around Liverpool ') these quarries yield impressions made by other species

of animals, which have been obtained by the author during several years' study

of the district. Some of these forms (hitherto undescribed) were exhibited. They

include

  --(a) Genus non det. Slab of Keuper sandstone showing hind and fore feet of

a smaller animal than C. Stortonense, with narrower toes, which curve inwards

--and are not separated, nor do they radiate as in true species of Cheirotherium.

foot and having very distinct claws on the digits.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  659

     The author thinks it desirable that some of tlie more definite forms among

the variety found on the slabs from the ' footprint bed ' at this quarry should be
accurately determined, if possible, instead of being included, as at present, under
the general term of ' Cheirotherian.'

     The author pointed out that, although fifty years bave elapsed since its
original discovery, the nature of the aniiual which made the impressions is still

as much a mystery as ever ; and that the more we study the known forms of
Labyrinthodonts, we are forced to conclude that, whatever was the animal by

which the larger five-toed footprints at Storeton were made, it cannot be referred
to any known species of Labyrinthodont.

    3. On some Lacustrine Deposits of the Glacial Period in Middlesex.
                      By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.

     In this paper the author refers to some deposits, consisting of stratified gravels,
sands, and clay, varying in thickness from a few feet to over 20 feet, which are
spread out over the plateaux of Hendon, Finchley, and Whetstone. They are
frequently covered over by the chalky Boulder Clay with northern erratics ; but
seldom themselves contain other materials than those which could have been

derived from the Tertiary or Cretaceous series in the south-east of England. No

marine fossils of contemporaneous age have been found in these deposits, but
remains of land animals occur occasionally in and under them. The author has

found that their geographical distribution is much wider than has usually been

supposed, and he has been led to the conclusion that they must have been deposited
durng the glacial period in a lake, whose waters attained to a height of nearly 400
feet above present O.D. This lake, he believes, occupied a considerable area in the
south-east of England, and spread for some distance south of the Thames, but was

dammed up on the east and west by ice and morainic matter. As the lake became
gradually reduced in size, lakelets were formed in the Thames valley, and the
stratified deposits now found there, except those in the immediate proximity of the
present Thames and its tributaries, date back to that period. Man, however, lived
in the valley before any of these deposits were thrown down hence it is that the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

flint implements and the mammalian remains usually occur under, or in the lower

parts of, the deposits.

             4. On Sporadic Glaciation in the Harlech Mountains,
                      By the Rev. J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.

  --The author drew a distinction between two results of glaciation the one,

negative, in which the rocks are rounded and striated, and all or nearly all the
debris removed ; the other, positive, in which the rocks ai'e covered by a thick
deposit of drift with boulders. In the Harlech Mountains district areas showing

                                                                                  uu2
660 REPORT--1894.

these opposite results lie side by side. Most of the glaciation is of the negative
Mnd, but the areas drained by the Crawcwellt and the Ysi^ethin are covered by

glacial cones of dejection. This difference is accounted for in the first instance

by the local drainage being opposite to the general drainage, and in the second
by the small size of the gathering ground for the ice. From these results it was
argued: 1. That drift deposits are, as a rule, left beyond the area of ice-flow.
2. That no submergence could possibly have taken place here since the Glacial
period, or the features above noted would have been obliterated.

5. On the Probable Tejnperature of the Glacial Epoch.
  By Professor T. G. Bonney, D.Sc, LL.D., F.R.S.

The Alps afford a means of estimating the highest mean annual temperature at

which glaciers can begin to form. This must not be more than about 27° F,

They also indicate the limits between which glaciers of various moderate sizes

form. The author finds that (assuming the present levels of sea and land un-

changed) a fall of 20° F. might just bring the Welsh glaciers down to the

sea-level, would certainly do it for the Cambrian hills, and would probably

Aproduce an ice-shed in the Highlands.  slightly less fall would suffice for the

Alps and Pyrenees. Again, a consideration of the traces of glaciers in the

Sierra Nevada, Sierra Guadarama, the Apennines, Corsica, Auvergne, the Vosges,

and the Schwartz wald shows that these indicate a fall of about 15°, while a

greater lowering of temperature would make their glaciers too large. The require-

ments of North America, New Zealand, Australia, and Tasmania, and other

places would be satisfied by about 15°, and in some cases by less. The limits

accordingly of the temperature of theglacial epoch must be from about 12° to 20°

lower than at present, according to situation.

        6. On the Inadequacy of the Astronomical Theory of Ice Ages '
      and Genial Ages. By Edward P. Culveewell, M.A., F.T.C.D.

     In reference to Sir Robert Ball's numbers, 63 and 37, giving the proportion of
summer and winter heat in the northern hemisphere, the numbers on which he

bases his theory, it is pointed out that in the latitudes with which the Ice Age is
comerned the contrast between summer and winter heat is vastly greater than is
shewn by these numbers, which lump together the heat everywhere, at the

equator, the poles, and the intermediate latitudes. Nevertheless, though the

arguments on which the theory is based may be made much more clear and

striking by taking the heat distribution over the northern part of the hemisphere,
the method of calling on the imagination to conceive what vast differences of

terrestrial temperature may be produced by a slight change in the daily distri-

bution of the (unchanged) annual heat is dangerous as not being sufficientlj' based

on experience. The argument is that, as the earth is kept at a temperature of,
say, 400° F. above zero by sun heat, we might expect a fall of 10 per cent, to
lower the temperature by, sa)', 40° F. But in this argument a number of very

--important elements are overlooked the diminished radiation from the cooler

body, the great time required for any considerable cooling, and the flow of heat
by water and air from the hotter to the cooler parts of the terrestrial surface. In

fact, so greatly do these causes modify the result that in these islands we now live

without inconvenience in a state of deprivation of solar heat during our coldest
199 days somewhat greater than that which, continued for the 199 days winter
of the great eccentricity period, was believed by Sir Robert to involve necessarily
an ice age over the northern hemisphere.

     The estimation of the change in terrestrial temperature due to the changes of
eccentricity made in the author's communication is obtained by an entirely

   A' paper giving details of the calculation will be published in the Phil. Mag.
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                     661

different method. The comparative amounts of solar heat for the various
latitudes are calculated (a) for the ' glacial ' winter of 199 days and (b) for the
coldest 190 days of our present winter. The result may he expressed thus : In
the 'glacial' winter latitudes 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, and 80° receive about as much heat
in their 199 coldest days as 44°-5, .54°, G4°, 74°, and 85° receive in the 199 coldest

days at present. Hence, so far as solar heat is concerned, the utmost effect of the
eccentricity would he to shift the winter isothermals by 4° to the south, the

summer isothermals being shifted by a far greater amount to the north. Hence
the astronomical theory cannot account for a shift of the isothermals by more than

--4° S. in winter and an average of more than 10° N. in summer a result ludicrously

inadequate to produce an ice age in Great Britain or Ireland, or in the United
States, unless, indeed, as a result of the ' glacial ' winter, latitude 50° receives vastly
less heat from the equatorial regions by air and ocean currents than latitude 54° at

present receives in an equal time ; and the general principle that the passage of

heat to equalise temperature is greater the greater the ditterence of temperature

between the hot and the cold body would, if applicable here, show that 50° in the

glacial period should receive even more heat than 50° now, so that we should not
expect as great a shift as 4°, even without taking account of the increased summer

temperature.

    When we examine the genial age by this method the result is still moie

remarkable. The calculations in the paper show that the summer and winter
isothermals would be shifted hy about ii|° only of latitude north and south

respectively. It seems entirely out of the question that any change, direct or

indirect, depending on so slight a cause could enable walnut trees to flourish in

Greenland.

     After a further examination of the astronomical theory as put forward by

Croll, the paper deals with the relation of existing ice-fields to isothermals, to

isobars, and  to contour  lines                          and  the belief  of the author is  that, while  no
                                                      ;

climatic changes due to causes known to be active at present could account for

the genial age, a local glacial period might easily follow from changed barometric

conditions, combined with a gradual elevation of land in a northern latitude.

Hence it would appear that either genial periods and glacial periods are due to a

shift of the pole, or else glacial periods are due primarily to elevation of the land,
while the genial age was due to greater solar activity and greater terrestrial heat

in the earlier geological ages.

 7. On the Mechanics of an Ice-sheet. By Rev. J. F. Blakk, M.A., F.G.S.

    The author attempted to explain how an ice-sheet can carry boulders up a

slope, and leave them at a height of 1,000 feet or more above sea-level. The sides
of the channel are, in the first instance, supposed to be parallel, so that the mass of

ice may be represented in a diagram by its longitudinal section. Taking for
simplicity the shape of the surface moved over to be represented by two
straight lines, one corresponding to the slope down from the mountains, the other

the slope up from the sea bottom to the final destination of the boulders, and taking
the surface of the ice as flat, the ice-sheet is represented by a triangle. This is

supposed to settle down in such a way that though the level of the end is higher,

the ceutre of gravity of the whole is lower. This fall of the centre of gravity is
the ettective cause of the motion of the ice-sheet, the resistance to be overcome
being that of the ice to change its shape. If the ice-sheet be supposed divided
into strips parallel to the slope from the mountains, these will be like a series
of overlapping glaciers, and under the influence of the pressure will swell out

at the bottom, and thus push the further end of the whole mass a little way up

the counter-slope. Continual additions of snow at the end where the ice-sheet
commences, or elsewhere on its surface, will be cumulative in their effects, and thus
the further end of the ice-sheet will ultimately ascend as required. Again divide
the triangle into strips by lines parallel to the counter-slope. The lower of these
strips will be pressed together, and any point on the base will be carried on in the
                                      --

direction of the -wliole motion at a greater rate than the higher layers, and thus
the stones, &c., on the sea bottom will be pushed up to their final reoting-place,
and anomalies of distribution might thus be accounted for by the previous dispersal
of the boulders. It was then shown that differences in shape of the ice-sheet and
its spreading out at the further end will make little difference in the argument,
and under certain conditions will aid the motion.

     The author then discussed the question of the glacial erosion of lakelets, and
indicated the conditions under which this is possible, particularly referring to the
difference between an ice-sheet such as that dealt with in the paper and an ordinary

glacier.

                              TUESDAY, AUGUST 14.

      The following Papers and Reports were read :

           1. On the Permian Strata of the North of the Isle of Man.
                         By Professor Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S.

      The main features of the geology of the island are identical with those of
 Cumberland and Westmoreland. The Ordovician strata form the ' massif in
 both areas, and constitute the sea-worn floor upon which the Carboniferous rocks
 rest unconformably. The Red Sandstone series of Peel, 1,368 feet in thickness,
 occupies but a very limited area, extending from the Cveg Malin, along the sea
 front, in a line of picturesque cliffs, about one and a half mile to the north-east,
 and extending inland about 1,700 feet. The rocks may be divided into two distinct
  groups. First, the Peel Sandstone series, or Rot-Rottodt-liegende, which presents
  a thickness of 913 feet, and the calcareous conglomerates and breccias of the Stack
  series, 455 feet thick, representing the magnesian limestone of the Perraians.
  These rocks are faidted into the Ordovician slates, and neither their true base nor
  their upper boundary is visible. The pebbles of Carboniferous Limestone in the
  conglomerates point to a post-Carboniferous age, and the physical characters of
  both divisions are identical with those of the Permian rocks of the North of
  England, and more particularly with those of the Lake District, of the Vale of
  Eden and Barrow Mouth, described by Sedgwick, Ilarkness, Binney, Eccles, and

  Nicholson. It is clear that north-eastern Ireland, the northern part of the Isle of

  Man, and the area of the Lake District, including the Vale of Eden, were parts of
  the same Permian marine basin, in which, as it approached southern Lancashire,
  the waters became more highly charged with mud, the calcareous element being
  conspicuous in the one, and being replaced in the other by thick accumulations of

   marl.

  2. The Carboniferous Limestone, Triassic Sandstone, and Salt-hearing Marls

   of the North of the Isle of Man. By Professor Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S.

       The Ordovician slates, quartzites, and conglomerates, and the associated
   volcanic rocks of the * massif of the island gradually pass underneath the sand,
  shingle, and clay of the Boulder Clay series in going northward along the coast
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  663

towards Kirk Michael, until they disappear altogether from the cliffs and the
shore, They stand up conspicuously along the ancient shore line extending from
Kirk Michael to Ballaugh, Sulby, and Ramsey, commanding the low, sandy, and
marshy region which forms the northern portion of the island, contrasting in its
tlatness with the lofty rolling Ordovician hills behind, culminating in Sartfell,
Snaefell, and North Barule. This contrast is obviously the result of a difference
in the physical character of the rocks in the two districts. The problem as to
which rocks underlie the glacial strata in the former, which had occupied the

author's mind for many years, is now partially solved by the three borings which
have heen made under his advice by Messrs. Craine in 1891-4 in search of the

Coal-Measures of the Whitehaven field, at the Point of Ayre, at Blue Point, and at
Lhen Moar. The boring at Lhen Moar revealed the existence of the Carboniferous
Limestone at a depth of 167 feet G inches below the drift. The next bore-hole, at
Blue Point, about 4,050 feet to the north-east of that at Lhen Moar, revealed the
presence of more than 60 feet of Red Sandstone buried 171 feet beneath the drift.
The Red Sandstone in this section is, in his opinion, identical with the St. Bees
sandstone, or lowest member of the Triassic formation in the district of the Lakes.

      This conclusion is greatly strengthened by the discovery in the third boring at
the Point of Ayre, to the east of the lighthouse, of the Triassic marls with salt, at a
distance of a little under five miles from Blue Point. The diamond drill was used
from a depth of 452 feet to the bottom. The total thickness of the salt-beds
amounts to 33 feet 6 inches, and the bore-hole happened also to intersect a brine run
2 feet 6 inches in depth. If this section be compared with that published by Mr.
Dickenson of the saliferous marls of Duncrue, near Carrickfergus, it will be found
to be practically identical. The same series of salt-bearing m«rls is also worked at
Barrow-in-Furness and at Preesal, near Fleetwood. The salt-beds in each of these

cases are variable in thickness, and those i)i the Isle of Man are thinner thaa in the
other localities. It must, however, be remembered that the Manx boring has not
been put down to a sufficient depth to test the true thickness of the salt-field. The

discovery is of great theoretical importance, because it links on the deposit at

Barrow to that of Carrickfergus, and shows that the Irish Sea was an area in which
 the salt-bearing Triassic marls were deposited. It points towards the truth of Mr,
Dickenson's suggestion that the Cheshire salt-field was formerly continuous with
 that of Ireland. These marls have .eince been broken up, faulted, and denuded

away in many places. It is an open question how far those of the Isle of Man
are now continuous under the sea eastwards to Barrow and Fleetwood, and to the

 north-west in the direction of Carrickfergus.
      All these rocks are buried under a great thickness of boulder sand, gravel, and

 clay, amounting at the Point of Ayre to 298 feet. To this also must be added the
 height of the drift hills close by, formed of the same materials, which would give the
 total thickness as not less than 450 feet in the extreme north. The rocky floor on

 which it rests dips rapidly to the north-east towards the deeper part of the Irish

 Sea.

     The discovery of this salt-field is likely to add a new industry to the resources
 of the Isle of Man.

3. Strictures on the Current Method of Geological Classification and
    Nomenclature, loith Proposals for its Revision. By Sir Henry

     HOWORTH, F.R.S.

            4. On the Pleistocene Gravel at Wolvercote, near Oxford.
                         By A. MoNTGOMERiE Bell, 31. a.

     The section is a typical illustration of a somewhat advanced period of
Quaternary time, and in its general features resembles the sections at Hoxne and
Bedford, originally published by Sir John Evans, while it is very difierent from
the implementiferous beds of an earlier age which are found on the Greensand
escarpment of Kent and Surrey.
664 REPORT-- 1894.

      (1) The Oxford clay, the bed-rock of the district, is furrowed at the surface
into wavy hollows, irregularly fiUed with earth containing quartz, lydian-stone,
 and quartzite pebbles, and bunches of unstratified gravel from the Thames basin.

 It is certainly a northern drift, in the writer's opinion a glacial drift.

     (2) At Wolvercote this drift is invaded, and for a certain distance removed by
 river action, which has hollowed out the clay to a depth of 17^ feet, and
 subsequently filled up the hollow with horizontal layers of gravel, mud, and sand.

      (3) The junction where the river eats into the drift is clearly visible. The
 bank of drift, underworn by the water, overhangs the horizontal layer.

      (4) The lowest bed of the riverine depo.sits differs from the others : it consists
 of 2^ feet of gravel and sand, in lenticular, shorn, and current-bedded layers,
showing by the size of the pebbles a somewhat rapid current. At the very base,
half embedded in the clay, many mammalian bones liave been found, and six
Palaeolithic implements. The implements represent well-known types of the river-

valley period, and the mammoth is conspicuous among the animal remains, though

 £quus, Cervus elaphus, and Bison prisms are also present.
      Layers of sand are intercalated with the gravel, from which eleven species of

shells have been identified. They are all recent and, generally speaking, stunted

 in size.

     (5) Above the gravel are two inches of sandy peat, marking a land surface of
some duration. Nine plants were identified by Mr. Clement Keid, which are all
epecies still to be found in the immediate neighbourhood.

     (6) For 14|^ feet sand and mud follow in successive layers. In these no fossil

has been found. They indicate quiet river action and an increase of pluvial

conditions.

      (7) Towards the surface they are traversed by an irregular line of trail, which
marks apparently the movement of a sludgy mass along the surface, punching it
downwards by its weight.

     (8) The surface level at Wolvercote is 240 feet above Ordnance datum. The
adjacent river surface is 195 feet. The gravel at Somerton and Oxford is about
218 feet. Thus between the two gravels there is a distance of 22 feet. At the
present rate of erosion many thousands of years would be necessary to remove
22 feet from the general surface ; but the fact that the remains of man and of

animals are the same in both gravels proves that they belong to a similar age,

though the gravel at Wolvercote is somewhat older than the other. We must

-- --therefore consider that the denuding agents rain and frost were more active at

that period than they are at the present day.

6. On Prehistoric Man in the Old Alluvium of the Saharmati River in

             Gujarat, Western India. By R. Bruce Foote, F.G.S.

     Two finds of chipped (Palaeolithic) implements were made in a bed of shingle

occupying a definite horizon in the lower part of the old alluvium of the Saharmati
in latitudes 23° 25' and 23° 40' N. (about 330 miles north of Bombay). The
implements were found at a depth of about 70 feet below the surface of the
alluvium, which is here over 100 feet thick. The alluvium is overlaid by loss
and wind-blown loam, which varies from 80 to 150 feet in thickness. The river
 has cut itself a bed varying from 100 to 200 feet in depth in these deposits, show-
ing that a great interval of time must have elapsed since the deposition of the old

alluvium in which the implements are embedded. On the surface of the liiss,
and in many cases on the summits of the blown-loam hills. Neolithic remains in

the form of "flint flakes and cores of the Jabalpur type were found together with
fragments of archaic pottery.

   6. On the Shai^e of the Banks of Small Channels in Tidal Estuaries.
                         By Professor H. Hennessy, F.R.S.

    Many j'ears since my attention was attracted by the peculiar shape of the soft

jnud banks bordering the channels through which water drains ott' the beds of
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                     665

tidal estuaries. These banks, instead of presenting sloping planes or concave

surfaces, are always convex when the matter of which they are formed is soft and

yielding. A section of such a pair of banks would present an approximation to a

Amatter.  few years since I found a result which may assist in exploring this-

phenomenon. The velocity of water in a channel is well known to depend on the

ratio of the area of the cross-section to its perimeter. This ratio is variable in all

known channels of water flowing through rigid materials such as canals and rivers.

On investigating the form of section corresponding to a constant ratio of the

quantities referred to, I found that it would be represented by a pair of catenaries

with their ends meeting so as to form a cusp like that in the estuary channels.^

The result would be that, with every depth of water in such a channel, the flow

would have nearly the same velocity.

   11. On a Keuper Sandstone cemented by Barium Sidphate from the
Peakstones Rock, Alton, Staffordshire. By W. W. "Watts, M.A., F.G.S,

Professor F. Clowes ^ has described a sandstone from the Himlack Stone, near

Nottingham, in which the grains are cemented with crystalline barytes, the

amount of this material varying from 28 to 50 per cent, in ditt'erent specimens.

AThis rock occurs at the base of the Keuper Sandstone of that locality.  some-

what similar rock, occurring at about the same horizon, is described by Mr. A.

Strahan,'' from Beeston Castle in Cheshire, and the same author refers to the frequent

occurrence of barytes in the Keuper breccias.

Bearing these facts in mind, the writer visited a curious isolated stack of rock^

called the ' Peakstones Rock,' near the village of Alton in Staflbrdshire, which is^

figured in Professor Hull's memoir on ' The Triassic and Permian Kocks of the

Midland Counties of England.' This stack is made of the lower beds of Keuper
Sandstone, but its outer portion has lost whatever cement it may once have con-

tained. It is, however, situated at the end of a spur which projects into a valley,,

and exposes a good deal of bare rock. This rock contains what at first look like

several veins of barytes two or three inches thick, striking along the spur and

straight through the place occupied by the Peakstones Hock. On examination of

specimens the veins are seen to be planes along which the sandstone is cemented
by barytes. The specific gravity of the rock is 3'09, and, as the grains are chiefly
subangular fragments of quartz and felspar, it must contain about 28 per cent,
of barytes. This almost insoluble cement has undoubtedly given rise to the spur
above alluded to, and almost as certainly has caused the survival of the Peakstones

Rock, which now, however, is so much exposed to the weather on all sides, and both

to mechanical and chemical disintegration, that if any cement is still left it can only
be in the inner part of the mass which cannot be reached by ordinary means. Another

specimen from * West of Kent Green, near Congrleton,' containing barytes, and with
a structure very like that described by Mr. Strahan, was also referred to. The
paper was illustrated by a set of photographs which the author owed to the kind-
ness of Mr. A. A. Armstrong and Mr. P. Simpson.

The President delivered the following Address :

The prospect of visiting Oxford to-day has, I am sure, been to all of us a pleasant

one, and we who are specially interested in biology have looked forward to our

meeting at this time with the distinguished members of the Oxford Biological

School. But as we gather here there will, I think, be present to the minds of all
of us a thought of one member of that school, whom we had hoped to meet, who

is recently gone from it in the prime of his intellectual life. By the death of

George John Romanes biological science is bereft of one of its foremost expositors,

Oxford is deprived too soon of one whose mental power was yet in its zenith, and

each one of us who knew him cannot but feel a deep sense of personal loss ; and
we shall in our meeting here sadly miss the man brimming with a geniality which

robbed differences of their difficulty and charmed away bitterness from those con-

troversies in which he revelled. This is not the occasion upon which to dwell on

Wehis character, his merits, or his work.  must all, I think, have appreciated the

graceful accuracy with which these were sketched in the pages of ' Nature ' by one

of his colleagues ; but under the shadow, as we are here, of his recent death, I
668  <  REPORT-- 1894.

believe I give utterance to feelings every one of you would wish expressed in

paying this passing tribute to his memory from the chair of the Section of the

Association devoted to the subject of his life-work.

I cannot open the business of the Section without referring to the fact that its

organisation appears to be variable, like the objects of its study. It has changed

its constitution more than any other Section of the Association, under influences

partly from within in the strength of its elements, partly from without in the local

circumstances of its meetings. At its origin it was the Section of Botany, Zoology,

Anatomy, and Physiology ; in the followmg year anatomy and physiology became

a new Section, E, onlj' after some years to merge again in the original one. Theii

--a partition was tried a physiology department and an anthropologj' department

were formed within Section D ; but the Montreal meeting saw anthropology as

HSection of the Association and physiolog}' again an integral portion of Section D.

--This year, as you are aware, physiology I must be careful to say animal physi-
-- --ology has again become a detinite Section I. Whether or no the habit thus

acquired through the environment of Oxford will be so permanent as to be trans-

mitted and appear at future meetings of the Association is a problem upon

mywhich I refrain from speculating ;  reason for mentioning this matter at all is

to point out that, as in previous devolutions of subjects from Section D, animal

physiology is the only physiology which is concerned. It was part of the original

proposal that plant physiology should form a portion of the province of Section I.

DTo this the botanical members of Section are unable to assent. AVe all readily

admit that the development within recent years of our knowledge of plant-life is

entirely in the direction of bringing to light fundamental similarities between the

vital processes in plants and in animals. To no one do we owe more in this sphere

of investigation than to two of the distinguished botanists from Germany whom

--we are glad to welcome at this meeting Professors Pfeffer and Strasburger.

And we fully reciprocate the desire for mutual comment and criticism implied in

the suggestion of combination. But allowing these as grounds for the conjoint

treatment of the physiology of plants and animals in one section, what we botanists
feel is that we are a compact body of workers in a science the boundaries of which

it is at present not difficult to define, and that to divorce physiology from mor-

phology and other branches of botany would tend to loosen our cohesion, would be

to go against the current of our progress, and would take all the vitality from our

discussions. To have papers on plant physiology dealt with in Section I, whilst

those on other botanical subjects were dealt with in Section D, would be not merely

an extremely inconvenient arrangement, from causes inherent in the subjects

themselves, but would strike at that fraternity and spirit of camaraderie amongst

those treading the same path of science, the promotion of which is the chief, if

not the only, function the British Association now fulfils. At the outset, there-

fore, of our meetings, 1 wish to make it known that papers and discussions on all

botanical subjects will take place in Section D.

    And now I pass to the special topic upon which I am to address you. In
selecting it I have followed the lead of those of my predecessors in this chair who

have used the opportunity to discuss a practical subject. Forestry, about which I

purpose to speak, is a branch of applied science to which, in this country, but little

attention has been given by any class of the community. By scientific men it has

been practically ignored. Yet it is a division of Rural Economy which ought to

be the basis of a large national industry.

There are no intrinsic circumstances in the country to prevent our growing

trees as a profitable crop for timber as well as our neighbours. On the contrary,

WeGreat Britain is specially well adapted for tree-growing.  have woodlands of

fine trees, grown after traditional rule-of-thumb methods, abundant in many dis-

tricts. The beauty of an English landscape lies in its trees and its pastures.

Nowhere in the world, probably, are to be found finer specimens of tree-growth.
As arboriculturists we are unrivalled. But the growing of trees for effect and in

plantations is a very different matter from their cultivation on scientific principles,

for the purpose of yielding profitable crops. This is sylviculture. The guiding

--lines of the two methods of culture are by no means the same nay, they may be
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  669

opposed ; and it is the sylvicultural aspect of the science of forestry wbicli bas

hitherto been neglected in this country. The recop;nitiou of this is no new thing.
But within recent years it has attracted considerable public attention, as the im-
portance of wood cultivation in our national life has been more realised ; and
although various proposals have been put forward, and some little effort made for

the purpose of remedying the admittedly unsatisfactory state oC forestry practice,
there bas been so far no great result. 1 attribute this in great measure to the

apathy of scientific men, especially botanists, and I am convinced that until they

devote attention to forestry the great issues involved in it will not bo rightly
appreciated in the country.

      It is not the first time the subject has been before this Section. I find that in
1885, at the Aberdeen meeting, a committee was appointed by it to consider
' whether the condition of our forests and woodlands might not be improved by

the establishment of a forest-school.' The good intention of the promoters was not
fulfilled, however. The committee did not meet.

     In the first instance, let me briefly refer to the national economic features of

forests as they affect us.

     There are two aspects from which forests are of importance to a country
firstly, as a source of timber and fuel ; secondly, on account of their hygienic and

climatic influences.

     With regard to the latter, it is a popular notion that trees exercise consider-
able influence upon atmospheric conditions ; but it is only within recent years, and

as the result of long experimental research in Switzerland, France, Austria,
Germany, and other areas where forestry is practised at a high level of excellence,
and also in the United States, that any sufficient data have been forthcoming to

form a basis of scientific conclusion upon so important a matter. Although many
points are still far from clear, the evidence goes to show that the direct influence
of tree-growth upon climate is no mere superstition. Stated in the most general

terms, it is proved that forests improve the soil drainage, and thereby modify
miasmatic conditions ; whilst, like all green plants, trees exercise, through the
process of carbon-assimilation, a purifying effect upon the air, the existence of the

increased quantity of ozone often claimed for the vicinity of forests is not yet
established; by opposing obstacles to air currents, forests prevent the dissemina-
tion of dust particles with their contingent germs ; they reduce the extremes of
temperature of the air ; they increase the relative humidity of the air and the
precipitation in rainfall, and they protect and control the waterflow from the

soil.

     To us these effects do not appeal with the same force that they do in Con-
tinental areas. Our insular and geographical position renders us in a measure
independent of them. The data for these Continental results, it must be remem-
bered, are derived from large forest areas such as do not exist here. For this
country I know of no experimental evidence on the subject. As, however, the

effects of forest influence are felt mainly in local modifications of climatic condi-

tions, we are not justified in regarding the conclusions that have been reached as
inapplicable to Britain. No little interest attaches, therefore, to a statement

based upon these Continental observations to which Dr. Nisbet has recently done

--well to call attention that ' where the rainfall is over forty inches it is undesir-

able to increase the forest area.' The significance of this dictum, if it be esta-

blished, to Britain, dependent so largely upon her agriculture, is evident. Wet

years, uni'avourable to farm crops, are, under existing conditions, more numerous
than favourable dry ones, and any extensive tree-planting in agricultural areas

might therefore prove disastrous. IBut I may here emphasise the point that, whilst
for the growing of specimen trees we may agree with Evelyn when he says, ' If I
were to make choice of the place or the tree, it should be such as grows in the best
cow-pasture, or upland meadow, where the mould is rich and sweet,' yet the

harvest which scientific sylviculture reaps comes from land unsuited to agriculture,
which would otherwise lie barren and waste, and therefore schemes for tha
afforestation of such areas in non-agricultural districts need not be prejudiced by

the prospect of an increased local rainfall. At the same time we must not fail to
670 REPORT-- 1894.

learn the obvious lesson that afforestation is not, as some suppose, a simple matter

of employment of labour, but that it involves the consideration of weighty

scientific problems.

Forests, as a source of fuel, have not the direct importance to this country,

rich as it is in coal-supply, that they have in States less favoured, but their

economic importance to us as a source of timber needs no comment. There are

no means available through which to estimate the annual output of timber from

our plantations, but indirectly we can gauge the insufficiency of our woodlands to

supply the timber necessities of the country by reference to the returns showing

the amount and value of forest produce annually imported. This has been

steadily increasing until in 1893 its value exceeded eighteen million pounds. Of

course a considerable proportion of the materials thus imported could not in any

circumstances be produced in Britain. But, after allowing a liberal discount for

these, there remains a large bill which we pay for produce, no small portion of
which could be furnished at home. No one would suggest that in the limited and

densely populated area of Great Britain timber-trees of kiods suiting our climate

could be grown sufficient to  supply all  our  demands                                              that would  be  impossible.
                                                                                                 ;

But few would venture to deny that we could do very much better for ourselves

than we do, and that our labour payments abroad might be materially reduced.
It is admitted that well-grown home timber is, of its kind, equal to, if not superior

in quality to, that which is imported ; it is surely, then, legitimate to expect that a

large supply of well-grown timber would enable us to hold the market to a much
larger extent than is presently the case, and that we might be very much less
dependent than we are upon the surplus timber of other nations.

The importance of this to the country is increased by the consideration of the

continued appreciation of timber. There is abundant evidence forthcoming to

indicate that the present rate of timber consumption of the world is in excess of

the present reproduction in the forests of the great timber-supplying countries,

and with the persistence of existing conditions we would appear to be within
measurable distance of timber famine. Experience, too, teaches that we may

expect not a diminution but rather an increase in consumption. No doubt as

civilisation advances the discoveries of science will, as they have done in the past,

enable us to substitute in many ways for the naturally produced wood other

substances prepared by manufacture ; but this saving in some directions has been,

and will probably continue to be, counterbalanced by greater utilisation in

--others witness, for example, the enormous development within recent years of

the wood-pulp industry abroad, and consider the prospect opened up by the manu-
facture of wood silk which is now being begun in Britain.

That the possibility of forest exhaustion is no chimera should be evident to any-

one conversant with current timber literature. Taking North Europe for in-

--stance : In Norway, ' raw timber is yearly becoming more expensive and more

difficult to obtain.' To Sweden ' pitch pine long beams are taken from America,

suitable ones of sufficient size and quality being unobtainable now in Sweden.' In

Scandinavia, the virgin forests, ' excepting such as are specially reserved by the

Government in the districts where mills are situated, are almost exhausted.' In

Russia, the Riga ' supply of oak is exhausted.' These sentences, culled within

the past few weeks from trade journals, show that this is a more pertinent

question than some would suppose. In Sweden, which, it is remarkable, is actually

importing logs from America, the situation is regarded as so serious that proposals

are on foot for the imposition of a tax upon exported timber for the purpose of

raising a fund for replanting denuded areas. But it is not only in North European

countries that there are signs of the giving out of timber forests. As they fail

the demand upon Canadian and American stocks increases, and when we look at

these Canada ' shows signs of beginning to find it hard to continue her voluminous

exports to Europe, and at the same time send sufficient supplies to the United

States.' But the most striking evidence is that furnished by the chief of the United

States Department of Forestiy, in his official report for the year 1892, in which he

says: * While tliere are still enormous quantities of virgin timber standing, the

supply is not inexhaustible. Even were we to assume on every acre a stand of
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D,                                                                                               671

-- --10,000 feet B.M. of saw timber a most extravagant averap^e we would, with our

present consumption, have hardly one hundred years of supply in sight, the time

it takes to grow a tree to a satisfactory log size. Certain kinds of supplies are
beginning to give out. Even the white pine resources, which a few years ago
seemed so great that to attempt an accurate estimate of them was deemed too
difficult an undertaking, have, since then, become reduced to such small proportions
that the end of the whole supply in both Canada and the United States is now

plainly in view.'

    It' must be owned that there are those who do not regard the suggestion of
forest exhaustion as a serious one. They argue that the prophecy is no new one,
and yet we are none the worse off than we have been ; that failing supply from one

source it has always been possible to tap another, and so it will probably con-
tinue ; and then, the period when exhaustion is likely to take place is so far off,

there is ample time for the growth of new forests to replace those being cut. No

doubt there is time. But this is just the kernel of the whole forestry question.
With proper conservancy of forest areas, the application of scientific principles to
the recuperation of areas recklessly denuded, and the aftbrestation of barren and
waste lands, timber sufficient to meet a greater demand than is now made could be

produced. This is the aim of scientific forestry, and it is to secure this that those

who have given attention to the subject are working, conceiving it to be a duty of
this generation to hand down to its successors a heritage no less valuable than that

which it received.
     With an acreage of wooded land amounting to only 4 per cent, of their total

area, Great Britain and Ireland possess a smaller proportion so covered than any
other European country. Denmark comes near with only about 5 per cent., iu
France the percentage rises to 15, in Norway and Germany to 25, in Austria-
Hungary to 30, whilst in Sweden the amount is over 40 per cent. The United
States is estimated to have about 25 per cent. These figures do not, however, give
a fair basis of comparison of the amount of timber area in Great Britain with
other countries, inasmuch as in the Continental lands the bulk of the woodlands is

true forest, whilst a large part of the area included in the British return is merely

pleasure ground, and another  large  portion  is  only plantation                                                              of  real  forest  the
                                                                                                                            ;

area is extremely limited. It is not surprising, then, that we are not able to

furnish ourselves with an adequate supply of timber. But although there is so

little land under wood, there are thousands of acres unsuited for any other crop,

and these, for reasons I have already indicated, it is desirable to have planted.

How to have this accomplished, and how to secure that woodlands already existing

shall be tended so as to produce a maximum result, giving a profitable return, are

the problems we wish to see solved.

It will conduce to appreciation of the question if I briefly discuss the causes

which have been active in developing the present condition of woodlands in Britain,

and in bringing about the disparity between it and other countries in respect of

woodland area.

     State ownership of Continental forests will probably occur to most people as the
reason for the difference in area just pointed out. This is true with, however, some

qualification. In consequence of the circumstances of their situation Continental

States have been compelled to recognise the national economic importance of forests.

This they have done, not so much by the creation of State ownership in vast forests

as by the organisation of a State Department of Forestry and a State system of

forestry education. It is altogether a mistake to suppose, as is often the case, that

the whole or even a large part of the forests on the Continent belong to the respec-
tive States. The amount of State-owned forest is surprisingly small. Fernow gives

it in Germany as about 33 per cent, of the whole forest area, in Scandinavia 15

to 20 per cent., in France some 10 per cent., in Switzerland 4 per cent., whilst in

Italy it is not 2 per cent. The bulk of the forest is in the hands of private owners

or corporate bodies, subject, though apparently not always, to some control or

limitation by the State. But the example of the States in the management of their

own woods, their readine.ss to give advice through their officials, and the education

which is carefully provided for those concerned in forestry work, have resulted in
672 REPORT-- 1894.

those privately-owned forests being as well managed as those of the State. It is
important to make clear this distinction, because it shows that a State system of
conservancy and supervision of forestry is quite compatible with large private
ownership in forests, and that efficient sylviculture upon a large scale is not
inseparable from State ownership.

    But someone may say, ' We, too, have State forests ! ' Yes, but it is almost

absurd to mention them in the same sentence with those of the Continent for any
part they play at present in connection with forestry in Britain. The nine thousand
acres at Windsor are mainly covered with specimen trees. Of the twenty-five
thousand acres in the Forest of Dean, a portion is supposed to be cultivated for a

profitable crop, but appears to result in an annual deficit. The New Forest, with

its sixty-three thousand acres of soil-area, affords us one of the most interesting
object-lessons, showing the triumph of sentiment over common-sense, that the
country affords. Its history is well enough known, and I need only remind you
that Parliament has decreed the major part of it to persist as a barren waste, whilst
in the remainder which is covered with trees the practice of forestry is prohibited,
60 that slowly the whole is going to wreck and ruin. This illustrates the value to
us of State forests ! In the days of the ' wooden walls ' the dockyards obtained

valuable timber from them, but now their large area is, one may say, of no State

service whatever as forest, if one excepts a small portion of AVindsor Forest
recently attached for instruction purposes to Coopers' Ilill College. There can be
no question that if the State had set an example of scientific forestry in even a

portion of these areas, the practice of sylviculture now throughout the country
would have been very difl^erent.

      I need not dwell on the fact that the conditions of land tenure in the country
have exercised an important influence upon the extent of wood-planting in the
country; and they must always do so. 'The oak scorns to grow except on free
land' is a saw that sums up pithily the relationship between land-laws and wood-

lands in England. Copyholders could hardly be e.xpected to plant much timber
when the lord of the manor claimed the crop ; and I believe it is possible in some

counties to trace the boundaries of copyholds by the entire absence of trees on one
side of a line and their luxuriant growth on the opposite side. The intricacies of
entail and the fact that life-renters had themselves to bear the expense of planting,
except where necessary for shelter, without prospect of seeing a return for the
outlay, must have operated prejudicially to an increase in woodlands. Happily,
since 1882 in England, and by an Act of last year for Scotland, the last-mentioned
restriction upon tree-planting is removed.

     Nor shall I pause over the question of game, which has been at once the
origin and the destruction of forests in Britain. Not that it is an unimportant
element. But the instinctive love of sport in the ]3ritish race is proof against all
 argument of utility, and the needs of sport will always be a barrier, as they have
 been in the past, to the planting of large areas well adapted for timber-growing.
 It cannot well be otherwise. Landowners can hardly be expected to forego large
 and immediate game-rents for what appear the long-delayed, even though possibly
greater, profits of timber-cultivation. In this case the inevitable must be accepted.
 Nevertheless, there are large areas, the game-rent of which is infinitesimal for their
 acreage, which might be planted.

      The most potent factors in bringing about the present condition of our
 woodlands are probably to be looked for in the nature of the crop itself and
 in the want of appreciation of its character manifested by landowners ; in a word,
 in a want of knowledge of the principles of scientific forestry. Forestry is handi-
 capped as compared with agriculture by the fact that the crop cannot be reaped

 within the year. The owner who plants and incurs the initial expense of stock,
 fencinfr, and perhaps draining, may after some years secure intermediate return

 from thinnings, but it will rarely happen that he reaps the final yield at maturity
 of the crop he has sown ; it will fall to his successor. It is this planting for
 posterity that makes demands upon the landowner to which he is unequal.

 Hence it comes about that woodlands, beyond what may be requisite in the way

 of cover plantation and for shelter, are often regarded as expensive luxuries, and,
       TRAXSACTIOXS OF SECTION D.                                             673

in the time of high agricultural values, landowners have even grubbed out trees

to make way for annual crops yielding an immediate return. But scientific tree-

growing for profit does not consist in the covering of soil area indiscriminately

with Irees, without definite system and relation of its part one to the other.

Just as the farmer has to plan his rotations on a definite system with reference

to his total acreage, so in properly managed timber-growing must areas be

arranged in such a way that some part of the forest will be yielding annually its

final return of mature crop, and cleared areas will by a natural process of regene-

ration replenish themselves without recourse to the expensive operation of planting

being necessary. Scientifically worked, a forest area on suitable land, of which

there is such abundance iu Britain, should be capable of yielding an annual net

revenue as regular as that obtainable by any other form of soil cultivation.

It is nevertheless frequently urged as a reason for not growing timber that

Awood will not pay in Britain.  landowner will tell you he has acres of land

which do not return him more than half a crown, and if it would pay better he

would be glad to put them under timber, but he does not believe it would; and

he will point to rates on woodlands wliich must be paid although no crop is

being reaped. He will demonstrate that there is no marlcet for home timber,

which seldom fetches its value, and that there is a prejudice against it which

increases the ditHculty of any attempt to compete with the foreigner.

There is some reason in the latter part of this contention. The wood-grower

in Britain has, I tliink, just cause for complaint when he finds his produce not

only hfindicapped by preferential transpoit rates to foreign timber, as has been

the case in the past, but that it is also disparaged by exclusion from, or admission

only under conditions to, competition with foreign timber by the terms of building

specifications. It is said to be the common practice of architects and others to

bar home timber in this way, and the Government itself has not been guiltless in

the matter. The Post Office form of tender a couple of years ago for telegraph

poles entirely cut out native produce from competition, and the conditions of

contract framed by the Board of Agriculture under the Land Improvements

Act were until recently almost prohibitive to home timber. These latter are
now modified, but whetber or not the Post Office still boycotts home produce I

cannot say.

   -- --However it is come about and there are no doubt various eifective causes this

iindervaluing of home-grown timber is quite unreasonable, and the slur cast upon

it is undeserved, so far as its quality is concerned. At the same time, there is

ground for saying tbat the ditliculties, occasioned in this and other ways, of dis-

posing of home timber at remunerative prices are due to causes not altogether

beyond the control of landowners who grow timber.

It is generally admitted that with a more regular and certain supply, as well

as a larger amount in different districts, home timber would have a better chance
of holding its own in the market. This is just what scientific forestry would

bring about. Given a systematic cultivation of forest on scientific principles of

rotation, and the conditions are prepared for a steady output of timber by annual

cut, as well as for a supply of raw material for utilisation in the manufacture of
the many subsidiary products derivable from forest growth. If landowners

would only provide such supplies, they would alter altogether, and to their own

advantage, the coudiiions under which they dispose of so much of their home
wood. The timber merchant who now travels hither and tbither over the

country picking up small lots where they may occur for transport to his, pro-

bably distant, mills, at a cost which eats a big hole in the value of the trees to

--the landowner, would find it worth his while and, for that matter, it would be

worth while for the landowner himself-- to erect, in the vicinity of the forest, mills

for the purpose of converting and preparing the timber, .md to put up machinery

for the extraction of usf-ful products from the waste wood. In such conditions

a steady market could be created in which the advantage would lie altogether oil

the side of the home-grown article, and materials, the debris of the forest, now

thrown aside as useless would be turned to account to the greater benefit of the

landowner. Encouragement, too, would be given to the establishment of lo^al

industries dependent upon forest growth, through which fresh outlets for forest

produce would be provided.

The amount of profit returnable from timber cultivation must of course vary

with the circumstances of the area in each case, but in comparing values it must

always be borne in mind that timber land is land which can yield no agricultural

rent. The official statistics relating to Continental State forests show us tiie result

of forestry on a large scale, and it is interesting to note how, under what we must

believe to be an equally efficient system of forestry management, the net revenue

from the several areas differs greatly. Thus from its two million acres of forest

area Bavaria draws a little over five shillings per acre per annum ; Wurtemberg,

with nearly half a million acres, gets a return of about eleven shillings ; and Saxony,

with a somewhat less area, receives over seventeen shillings per acre per annum.

For this country we have no such figures. Our State forests result in a loss, it is

unfortunate, too, that no returns are available from private forests and woodlands,

either in Britain or abroad. Estimates of possible profits in this country we have

abundantly, but solid figures of e.xpenditure and receipt in relation to timber-

growing there are none. By the favour of Mr. Munro-Ferguson, M.P., who, as a

landowner, exhibits a most enlightened spirit in regard to forestry, I am, however,

able to cite the case of a pine and larch wood at Novar, in Ross-shire, twenty-four

acres in extent, which was clean cut in 1883, and gives instructive figures. After

sixty-one years' growth on land similar to that which in the neighbourhood yields

a grazing rent of from one to two shillings per acre, it is found to have yielded a

net sum equal to a revenue to the landlord during the whole period of its growth

of over nine shillings per acre per annum, or an increased value of quite seven

shillings per acre per annum. Although it refers to only a single wood of limited
extent, this return shows how profitable waste land may become under timber.

No doubt from the estates of other of our landlords who own extensive woodlands,

where, if there is not the liighest scientific forestry, there is certainly good wood

--management, results of an equally instructive kind could be obtained many would

be better; and it is much to be desired in the interest of forestry that they should
be made known as an object-lesson to those who doubt the profit of tree-growing.

But in the return I quote from there is another interesting point which I must

not fail to note. Dui'ing the period of growth of the wood, the outlay upon labour

in connection with it amounted to a sum equal to an expenditure of over thirty-one

shillings per acre per annum. That is to say, tliis sum was distributed in wages to

the people of the neighbourhood. This exhibits the benefits brought in the train

of forestry, which are no less important to the community at large than is the

profit of the crop to the landowner. The scientific treatment of woodlands and

cultivation of forests for profit on a proper scale involve the employment of a con-

siderable amount of labour, much of it at a time when there is little else doing in

country districts, not only in the actual tending of the forest area, but in the

manipulation and subsequent preparation of the timber, and in the manufacture of

the numerous by-products obtainable from it. In these days of congestion in cities

the importance ot the development of such an industry which can provide occupa-

tion in the country, and thus may aid in restraining migration to the towns, has not

escaped notice, and ii cannot be too often or too greatly emphasised.

The influences, to which we have just given attention, that have prevailed in

bringing about the present limited area of woodland in Britain are, it will be seen,

not wholly irremovable, nor are the obstacles to betterment insurmountable. And
-- Howthe question we have now to discuss is
                                              are these to be counteracted and

overcome? By what means isjt possible to bring forestry in Britain more in line

with that of othei' nations? At the outset I would say that if forestry is to be

established on a sound commercial basis, the only one on which it should rest, if

Ave are to have a national home-timber industrj-, it can only be when the issues

involved are more fully realised than they are nowadays. As in agricultural

practice failure can only be obviated by the application of scientific methods in

farm cultivation, so is it with forestry. To become a profitable industry it must be

practised as nn applied science, and not as an empirical routine.

   We live beyond the days when it would be possible to apply the autocratic
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                   675

remedy for want of woodlands introduced in Scotland by the Jacobean statute,
which compelled the landlords not only to plant wood and forest and make hedges,
but also enjoined them under penalties to see that each of the tenants planted one
tree for every marke of land. Nor, indeed, can much be said of the success of the

compulsion. And I do not imagine anything could be gained nowadays by the

method adopted in Scotland in the middle of last century by the ' Select Society,'

as it was called, of oflering a premium to farmers who planted the most trees

within a specified time. That such processes were deemed necessary is interesting

as showing how old standing has been the recognition of the want of sufficient
woodland area in the country. At the present time there are those who would
reverse, as it were, the process of the old statute, and who look to the acquisition

by the State of large areas of waste land, and their atlbrestation by it, for the
solution of this forestry question. It is, no doubt, a wise policy which encourages

private enterprise to deal with the details of industries, and only invokes State aid

as a directive and controlling force when its need can be clearly shown. That

there is need for State aid in the case of forestry I do not deny, but it is not

required to the extent just mentioned.

    I unhesitatingly say that the State ought to treat the forest areas now in its

possession in a reasonable and scientific manner, instead of leaving them as objects

for the finger of scientific scorn. They might be made, in part at least, models of

the best forestry practice. It is no use to dispute with the sentiment and taste

which have prevailed in making the New Forest what it now is, and it is hopeless

to expect a unanimous verdict as to the destiny of State woods and upon the
Wemethod of treatment to which they should be subject.
                                                        have had recently, in

the lively discussion regarding the management of Epping Forest, an illustration

of how large is the number of people who have views upon the subject of the

management of woodlands, and how the majority of them, if they had their way,

Wewould, through ignorance, defeat the very object they desire to accomplish.

must be prepared in any proposal for utilisation of" State forests to incur the

opposition of those who regard all scientific handling of woods as vandalism,

although I do not know that forestry in itself involves a want of recognition of the

beautiful, or dulls the feelings which a sylvan landscape invokes in the minds of

those in touch with Nature. It is allowed there are areas in our State forests

sacred by many memories, possessing a grandeur and picturesqueness with which no

hand, whether of forester or landscapist, would venture to meddle. But, on the

other hand, there are tracts which without damage to the natural beauty, and

without depriving in any sensible degree the people of their privileges of recreation
they prize so much, might be and should be dealt with as forest cultivated on
scientific principles. These might serve as instruction areas, showing all that is
best for the information of foresters. The creation of some such experimental
teaching stations in State forests is one of the essentials for forestry in Britain. I
would go further and say that the area of State ownership should be increased to
the extent of the establishment of forest stations, of an acreage sufficient to allow

of a satisfactory rotation, in other parts of the country as centres of instruction.
There have been, as you are aware, proposals for the aHorestatiou of some of the

three million and more acres of waste land in the Highlands of Scotland capable of
growing timber, and we await with some interest the ]-eport of the Deer Forest

Commission, which has taken evidence on the subject. If, as hns been suggested

may be possible, aSbrestation is attempted through any system of State-aided
planting, an opportunity would be aflbrded for securing what would be of so
much advantaare to the country. Beyond this system of model experimental
stations, the State ownership of forest in Britain does not seem to me to be

necessary in the cause of forestry.

     Replying recently to Sir John Lubbock in the House of Commons, the President
of the Board of Agriculture, after recounting what his Board is now doing for forestry
in Britain, added : ' I shall always be glad to receive and to consider any suggestion
for the increase of sound technical knowledge on this subject.' Well, now, 1 have
a suggestion to make. In a practical science like forestry ' an increase of sound

technical knowledge' can only be possible when facilities for practical instruction

676 REPORT--1894.

 are provided. I would, therefore, ask the President to consider what I have just
 said with regard to State forest experimentnl areas. These cannot, of course, be
created by a stroke of the pen, but the initiative for their formation would
 naturally come from the Board of Agriculture. It is possible that, with better-

ment in forestry jjractice, landowners might be found who would be willing to

 devote portions of their land for the purposes of instruction, following for forestry

 the noble example of Sir John Lawes in his work for agriculture ; and everyone
 interested in forestry' must hope this may be so. But v.dien the State has already
 in its hands the means through which a large national industry can be fostered, it

is surely incumbent on it to utilise them for the pui-pose. And mark you, in

asking for this, one does not make a large demand upon the Treasury. The whole

 could be done at no ultimate cost, for the profits from the areas could unquestion-
 ably more than repay any outlay incurred upon them.

      The true solution of the forestry question in Britain is to he found in the
diffusion of accurate knowledge of forest science. The landowner has to be
convinced that through scientific forestry a sound and profitable investment for
his capital is to be found in woodlands ; the factor or land agent must be
instructed in the scientific principles of tree-growing for profit to enable him to
secure a steady income to the landowner from his invested capital ; and the
working forester has to be taught methods of cultivation based upon science, by
which his fnith in traditional practice, when it is, as is so often the case, un-
scientific, may be dispelled. It is through education alone that we can arrive at
improved forestry.

     This was recognised by the Select Committee upon Forestry of the House of

Commons in its report in 18S7, which performed a very valuable service by its

exposure of the prevalent ignorance of scientific lorestry and of well-known facts
of tree-cultivation amongst those professedly engaged in its practice and study
an ignorance the continued existence of which manifests itself in some of the
writings in current periodicals. The remedy it suggested of a State Forest
Board, including representatives of science and of bodies interested in forestr)^,
charged with the superintendence of the formation of forest schools and the
preparation of forest literature, was superseded by the later institution of the
Board of Agriculture, in which were absorbed such functions in regard to forestry
as the Government of the day accepted. "We are so accustomed to anomalies in
our administrative system that the discovery of an additional one hardly surprises

us. Yet it is difficult to understand why it is that a board which "deals witli

subjects so essentially based on science as does the Board of Agriculture should

not have on its start' scientific men representative of the fields of science within its
purview. But I do not know that either agriculture or forestry is so represented.

It seems odd that this Board should be dependent for scientific advice upon out-

siders, and now that it proposes to undertake the responsibility of the publication

of a journal which, I take it, will be a means for the circulation of accurate infor-

mation upon scientific questions, I do not see how ita functions can be adequately
performed without scientific help from within. No one of us would expect to see,

either to-day or to-morrow, in this countrj' a Board of Agriculture with an organi-
sation like that of the similar department in the United States, which excites our
admiration by the excellence of the practical information it circulates. But there
is a wide interval between the completeness of the American department and the

incompleteness of ours; and if I may make another suggestion to the President of
the Board of Agriculture, I would ask him to consider whether it would not
strengthen the Board in the discharge of its rapidly growing functions if it had
competent scientific advisers upon its staff. Such a man for forestry would, I
believe, do much for ' the increase of sound technical knowledge ' in Britain, and

promote to no little extent its interests.

     Since 1887 we have made some advance along the lines of improved literature
and of teaching pointed out by the Select Committee as those by which reform could

be accomplished.

     If one looks at the literature available up to a recent period to anyone desirous
of learning something about forestry, one need feel little surprise at the ignorance
              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                              677

which prevailed. It was alike meagre in amount and deficient in quality, consist-
ing chiefly of the records of empirical practice of men who liud Lad no scientific
training. It is satisfactory to note that these are now being replaced by works

having some pretension to scientific method and accuracy. From Cooper's Hill

there is issuing, more slowly than could be wished, Professor Schlich's excellent

'Manual of Forestry,' and from his colleague Professor Fisher we may, 1 believe,
aeon expect an important forestry book. You all know Professor Marshall Ward's

lucid little books on timber and plant-diseases, and we are promised immediately,

under his editorship, a translation of Hartig's ' Diseases of Trees,' by Professor

ASomerville.  most valuable and interesting contribution to forestry literature is

the book by Dr. Nisbet, recently issued from the Clarendon Press, containing the

lectures he delivered in the University of Oxford during the past year ; and to his

marvellous energj^ we shall owe the new edition of ' Brown's Forester,' which is

shortly to appear, and an English version of Hartig's ' Text-Book ' for foresters.

All this activity shows an increasing interest in forestry, but it is only the begin-

ning of a movement to make up for the preceding dearth. Botanists are greatly

--indebted to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press and it is fitting I should here

--acknowledge the obligation for the splendid series of standard foreign works on

botan}' they have brought within the reach of English-speaking students, and which

have done so much for the progress of botany in Britain. If we li:tve now got
beyond tbe stage of dependence in pure botany, we are far from it in scientific

forestry, and I would hope that the Clarendon Press will add to its botanical

series some of the standard foreign forestry books, and thus aid in the dissemina-

tion of the knowledge so essential to progress in the subject.

I must not omit to refer here to the excellent opportunity that is afforded for

the circulation of scientific information by the new journal of the Board of

Agriculture, of which intimation has recently been made, and it is to be hoped

that forestry will find a place in it side by side with agriculture.

The attention paid to the teaching and study of forestry by Continental States,

their many schools and copious literature of forestry, make it remarkable that,

apart altogetlier from the economic side, forestry as a subject of study and

investigation lias not been long ago introduced in some of our teaching centres.

I tliink the Sibthorpian Chair of liural Economy of the University of Oxford was

for long the only one through which forestry was recognised as within the sphere

of university education. So fiir the limited tenure of this chair, in its new dress,

--has been held by agriculturists in their line the most distinguished men ; but I

.should like to think that one may look forward to a time when foresiry shall have

its turn, if by that time it has not come about that it is otherwise provided for.

It was, however, only the necessities of India which, at a comparatively rt'cent

date, led to the first starting of forestry teaching in Britain, and then only at the

cost of India, and for those destined to serve there as foresters. Cooper's Hill

--College, the outcome of these, with its excellent equipment including now, I
--believe, a slice of "Windsor Forest for purposes of practical work possesses the

elements of a successful forestry school, and it has within recent years opened its

doors to outsiders who may wish to learn forestry. But, so far as I am aware, it

does not draw the young landowners of the country as it should do. Possibly the

expense of the special education, which equals that of the universities without

oflering the advantages in other directions they afford, may be deterrent ; but I am
inclined to think that if the authorities made the fact better known that men

other than foresters for India are admitted to the college, more would avail

themselves of the opportunity.

Beyond this and some slight notice of forestry at agricultural colleges, there

have been no facilities for forestry-teaching in Britain until within the last half-

dozen years. I leave out of reckoning mere examining boards. Can we wonder,

then, that there is a general want of intelligent appreciation of scientific forestry 'i
Even now all that has resulted from the agitation in favour of more attention

--being given to this subject is a lectureship on forestry in the University of

Edinburgh, supported partly by the Board of Agriculture and partly by an

endowment from subscriptions among landowners and others (and, I may mention

ior an agricultural decree) ; a chair, or part of one, in the Royal Collej^e of

.Science at Newcastle, founded conjointly by the Board of Agricultm-e and the

County Council ; a course of instruction in science ior practical foresters in the

lioyal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, maintained by the Board of Agriculture;

and a lecture course on forestry in ihe Ghxsgow and" West of Scotland Technical

Institute, similarly provided ior. I must not omit to mention, too, the beginning,

just made, by the Surveyors' Institute of the formation of a forestry museum in

London, whicli should have an important educative influence. Little though it is,

I tlaink there is occasion for congratulation that even so much ha? been done to

provide instruction, nnd I would have you note that in this education the diti'erent

i-iasses concerned with forestry' are all recognised. Valuable as the teaching so

being given is, it must have an effect in showing the need there is for more. lu

one way the teaching of all these bodies is incomplete, and must be imperfect,

inasmuch as they have not the means lor practical forestry work. Until this is

provided, as I have indicated already, the teaching of forestry cannot be thoroughly

carried out.

    But, after all, what has been done in the way of supplying our wants in the
way of teaching is nothing to what is required if forestry is to be adequately

taught in Britain. Dr. Nisbet, who, in his book already mentioned, has had the

last say on this question, boldly states the requirements at six forestry chairs in

universities, and four schools of practical sylviculture in tlie vicinity of forests. I

do not think he put the needs one whit too high. I should be even disposed to add

to them, because I note he has omitted to take into account the claim of Wales,

whence there has recently been a request for the establishment of forestry teaching.

But there are two questions strictly pertinent to this demand, which need

answering if the proposals are to be brought within the sphere of practicability

firstly, whence are the funds  to  be obtained   for  this  organisation                                                   and, secondly,
                                                                                                                        ;

where are we to get the teachers ?
  --Dr. Nisbet puts his hand in the Treasury pocket for the monej' some five
--thousand pounds per annum lequired by his scheme. I do not think many of us

will be so sanguine as to expect the whole financial aid could le directly obtained

in this way. But it may be, I think, of significance in regard to this to consider

the sources from which money has been forthcoming for what has already been
done. The Government, through the Board of Agriculture, has given most, the

remainder has come from the County Councils and from private contributions.

There is no reason to suppose the Board of Agriculture will be less willing in

the future than it has been to aid in theestablishin^of forestry teaching in suitable
-- --centres
                                        ;
but           its  support  from   the  limited  funds  eight thousand pounds                                              at its

disposal for educational purposes is always given as a grant in aid, and is contin-
gent upon evidence of local effort towards the end desired, which we must therefore

look to in the hrst instance.

It is of no use to speculate upon the prospects of private munificence providing

Weequipment in any centre.        ujay hope for it, but I do not think times are such

as to lead us to expect large pecuniary aid from landowners. After vigorous effort
amongst them, extending over some years, to secure an endowment for a chair of

forestry in Edinburgh, a sum of a little over two thousand pounds is all that has

been raised.

But forestry is one of those subjects to the teaching of which we may be more

sanguine of support from County Councils. It will always be a matter of regret
to scientific men, and those interested in the industrial progress of the country, that
the grand opportunity furnished by the fund dealt with under the Local Taxation
Act (1890) was not taken more advantage of by the Government of the day.

Distributed, even in part, through representative educational institutions, it could

have provided equipment for technical education of the highest kind beyond our
dreams. Thrown at the heads of the County Councils, before these bodies had had

time to settle to their prescribed work, there has been, in the opinion of those well

qualified to judge, no little waste. You could not create all at once the machinery

requisite for the most efficacious expenditure of half a million of money on tech-
             !;

                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.     G79

nical teaching. Much of the work done by these todies is admirable. It is indeed
surprising' in the whole circumstances how efficiently technical instruction has been
carried out, and no doubt it will improve. Rut it had a most extravairant start.

It is difficult to trace, in the general returns of the technical education undertaken

by the County Councils, the details of their work, and I have not bei'n able to

discover how far forestry has been treated as a subject of instruction. It has not,
1 think, been often included. But the example of Northumberland and Durham

in respect of the Newcastle chair is one that gives encouragement for thinlcinir that,
if the due importance of forestry to the community were made clear. County

Councils, in districts favourable for forestry and its concomitant industries, miglit

come forward with some of the financial support needed for the provision of the

educational equipment.

    It appears to me that whilst we must obtain from the Government the institu-

tion of sylvicultural areas for practical instruction, our best chance of success in

acquiring the necessary endowment for the rest of the teaching lies in the line of

combination between the Board of Agriculture and the County Councils, with, it

may be, aid from private benefactors. But if we were to draw financial support
from County Councils, or from private sources, we must as a first step towards

this make known, more thoroughly than it is, the nature of the national interests

Weinvolved.  must disabuse landowners, land agents, and practical foresters of

the notion that forestrj^ consists in the random sticking in of trees, which anyone,

Weno matter bow unskilled, may accomplish.  must bring home to the people's

minds that in science is to be found the only sure guide to proper timber-growing,

and that scientifically managed forests are alike a profit to the producer, a benefit

to the community of the region in which they are reared, and a source of national
wealth. Once we have got so far as to create this opinion, the funds for as

extended a scheme of forestry education as may be necessary will, I venture to

think, be forthcoming.

  --There is still the other question to answer Whence are the teachers to come ?

This is, I think, fundamental. For, given a competent teacher, he will soon find

opportunity for teaching. If to-morrow the whole or even a half of the chairs

suggested by Dr. Nisbet as essential were founded, how .should we meet the demand

Wefor men to fill them ?  might, of course, draw upon the Indian Forest Ser-

vice, but I do not know where you would find teachers in Britain. But if there is

no prospect of such immediate requirement of teachers, that does not make the

fact of their deficiency of any less moment. There is surely something wrong
when men capable of giving scientific instruction in so important a practical

subject are so scarce.

This is how it touches us botanists, and upon our shoulders I am disposed to

Wethrow the blame for the present outlook.  do not seem to liave realised, except

in relation to medicine, that modern botany has an outlet. Perhaps it has been

Wethe influence of medicine that has engendered this.  find chemists and

phy.sicists devoting their science to the furtherance of practical aims. Zoologists

have applied theirs to the elucidation of problems bearing on the fishery industry

.and we see in that monument to the ability and energy of Professor Ray Lankester,

the marine biological laboratory at Plymouth, an experimental station which,

while it contributes to the nation's prosperity, serves at the same time as a home of

pure research. But where is the practical outcome of modern botany ? I must

not overlook such brilliant work as that of Marshall Ward, full of purpose, and
significant as it is to many large industries, nor that of Oliver in its bearings on
horticulture. But it does seem to me that the general trend of botanical work in

Britain is not utilitarian. Perhaps as good an illustration as could be given of the

slight practical importance attached by the lay mind nowadays to botany is the

--fact that the Scottish Universities Commissioners have made it* though I must

--add it is bracketed with zoology optional with mathematics for the degree in

agriculture

     It is matter of history that its utilitarian side gave the first impetus to the

scientific studj' of botany. The plant-world, as the source of products of economic

value and drugs, attracted attention, and out of this grew, by natural development,

the systematic study of plants. The whole teaching of botany was at the first, and
continued for long to be, systematic and economic, and it was from this point of
view that, the herbalist having become the physician, botany became so essential
a branch of medical study. It is noteworthy that as an early practical outcome of
the study came tlie establishment of botanic garden?, which, at their institution,
were essentially what we would now style experimental stations, and c(mtributed
materially to the introduction and distribution of medicinal and economic plants,
and to the trial of their products. If they are now in many instances simply
appendages of teaching establishments, or mere pleasure-grounds, we at least in
Britain are fortimate in possessing an unrivalled institution in the Royal Gardens
at Kew, which still maintains, and under its present able Director has enormously

developed, the old tradition of botanic gardens as a centre in our vast empire,
through which botany renders scientific service to our national progress.

      In Britain, consequent perhaps on our colonial and over-sea possessions, the
systematic side of botany continued predominant long after morphological and
physiological work had absorbed the attention of the majority of workers and

made progress on the Continent. Not that we were wanting in a share of such
works, only it was overshadowed by the prevalent taxonomy, which in the hands
of many no longer bore that relation to its useful applications which had in the
first instance given it birth, and hal become little more than a dry system of

nomenclature.

     The reaction of a quarter of a century ago, which we owe to the direct teaching of
Sachs and De Bary and the influence of Uarwin, many of us can remember : in it some
who are here to-day had a share. Seldom, I think, is a revolution in method and
ideas of teaching and study so rapidly brought about as it was in this instance. The
morphological and physiological aspect of the subject infused a vitality into the
botanical work which it much needed. The biological features of the plant-world
replaced technical diagnosis and description as the aim of teachers and workers in
this field of science. No weightier illustration of the timeliness of this change
could be found than in the attitude of medicine. But a few years ago he would
have been rash who would predict that botany would for long continue to be

recognised as a part of university training essential to medical students. Its utility

as ancillary to materia medica had lost point through the removal of pharmacy
from the functions of the physician. But what do we see now ? Not the exclusion
of botany from the university curriculum of medical study, but the recognition to
such an extent of the fundamental character of the problems of plant-life, that it
is now introduced into the requirements of the colleges.

     But if the old taxonomic teaching was stifled by its nomenclature, there is, it
seems to me, a similar element of danger in our modern teaching, lest it be
strangled by its terminology. The same causes are operative as of old. The
same tendency to narrowing of the field of vision, which eventuates in mistaking
the name for the thing, is apparent. AVitli the ousting of taxonomy, and as the
laboratory replaced the garden and museum, the compound microscope succeeded
the hand-lens, and for the paraphernalia of the systematist came the stains,
reagents, and apparatus of microscopical and experimental work as the equipment
necessary for the study of plants, the inwards rather than the outwards of plants

have come to form the bulk of the subject-matter of our teaching, and we are
concerned now more with the stone and mortar than with the general architecture
and plan of the fabric ; we are inclined to elaborate the minute details of a part at

the expense of its I'elation to the whole organism, and discuss the technique of a
function more in the light of an illustration of certain chemical and physical
changes than as a vital phenomenon of importance to the plant and its surroundings.
This mechanical attitude is quite a natural growth. It is a consequence of
specialisation, and it is reflected in our research. But it must be counteracted
if botany is in the future to be aught else than an academic study, as it was of old
an elegant accomplishment. It has come about very mucli because of that want
of recognition by botanists, to which I have already referred, of the natural outlets

--of their study of theii' failure so far to see the lines through which the subject

touches the national life. Modern botany has not yet found in this country its
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                     681

full application. It has not yet rendered the State service as it ought, and as was

done by the taxonomic teaching it supplanted.

     It is from this point of view that I wish to point out to you to-day that

--tlirougli forestry and although I have particularly dealt with this branch of Rural

--Economy, what I say is equally true of horticulture and agriculture modern

botanical study should find a sphere of application by which it may contribute to

our national well-being, and which would have a directive influence upon its

teaching, taking it out of the groove in which it tends to run. AVhat we botanists

need to do in this connection is to teach and to study our subject from a wider

platform than that of the mere details of individual form, and to encourage our

pupils to study plant-life not merely in water-cultures in the laboratory, but in the

broader aspects exhibited in the competitive field of Nature.

If forestry is ever to thrive in Britain botanists must lay the foundation for it

Wein this way.  cannot expect to make our pupils foresters, nor can they yet

get the practical instruction they require in Britain. In this we must depend

yet a while on Continental schools ; the stream of Continental migration, which

needs no longer to flow in morphological and physiological channels, must now

turn in the direction of forest schools. But we can so mould tlieir studies and

give bias to their work as will put theni on the track of this practical subject. If

we had only a few men so trained as competent foresters, and capable of teaching

forestry, there would be an efficient corps with which to carry on the crusade

against ignorance and indiifereuce, the overcoming of which will be the prelude to

the organisation of forestry schools and scientific sylviculture in Britain. The

influence of the individual counts for much in a case like this. The advent of a

capable man started forestry teaching in Scotland, which years of talk had not
succeeded in doing. And so it will be elsewhere.

I have endeavoured, thus briefly, to sketch the position, the needs, and the

prospects of forestry in Britain. Its vast importance as a national question must

sooner or later be recognised. It is a subject of growing interest. Its elements

are complex, and it touches large social problems ; but the whole question

ultimately resolves itself into one of the application of science. To botanists

we must look in the first instance for the propagation of the scientific knowledge

upon which this large industry must rest. They must be the apostles of forestry.

And forestry in turn will react upon their treatment of botany. Botany cannot

thrive in a purely introspective atmosphere. It can only live by keeping in touch

with the national life, and the path by which it may at the present time best do

this is that ottered by forestry.

                 1. On the Didermic Blastocyst of the Mammalia.
                    B)j Professor A. W. W. Hui3RKcnT, LL.D.

    It is a fact that about the simple and early didermic stage of the mam-
malian blastocyst very divergent views are at the present moment held by
difl'erent observers. Only lately an English embryologist, who with great technical

skill has considerably added to our knowledge of the development of the mouse,
brought forward certain ingenious speculations concerning this didermic stage in

other mammals besides those with which he was personally acquainted. The author

referred to Ur. Ilobinsou's paper in vol. xxxiii. of the ' Quarterly Journal of
Microscopical Science.'

     According to these views the outer layer of the monodermic blastocyst is in
reality a hypoblastic layer. The didermic phase essentially originates out of this
                                                                 --

682 REPORT--1894.

by a gradual spreading of epiblast cells outside the more primitive bypoblastic

wall.

    However ingenious these speculations may be, the author holds them to be

erroneous.

    As an example of a mammal the early development of which furnishes us

with decisive evidence in this respect, the author wishes to call attention to

Tupnja javanica, a small insectivorous mammal from the Malay Archipelago, of

which a stufled specimen was exhibited.

    Of this mammal the author possesses a most complete series of preparations

of the early developmental phases, including the extrusion of the polar bodies, the
fecundating process, the segmentation, &c. Selections from these preparations

were brought over by him to the meeting, which were demonstrated to those who
were desirous to look at them more closely.

    On the plate exhibited to the Section a few of the more important stages were

figured by which the growth of the didermic blastocyst is elucidated.

     It was seen that during the early stages of cleavage of the ovum there is no

sensible difference in size of the cells then arising. Still, as early as the solid
morula-stage, there is an unmistakable outer layer and an inner core of cells, the

latter increasing from one to about a dozen cells. When the latter number is

exceeded a cavity arises, the outer layer becomes the wall of this early mono-
dermic phase, and the inner core is massed together.

      "With equal rapidity, however, a further differentiation of this inner core into

a layer of ilattened cells and a knob of more cubic ones is now inaugurated, the
former arranging themselves into the inner wall of what then becomes the

didermic blastocyst, the latter being at the outset a local thickening of this inner
layer. The outer layer forms a closed sac over and above the inner laj'er and the

thickened knob. The outer layer is what the author has called the trophoblast,
the inner layer the hypoblast, the thickened knob containing the material out of
which both the epiblast and the hypoblast that are going to contribute towards
the formation of the embryo itself'will be evolved.

      This takes place simultaneously with a rapid extension in size of the didermic

blastocyst.

     The embryonic knob may be said to have a more flattened and a more convex

surface ; the former is applied against the trophoblast, the latter protrudes into

the cavity of the blastocyst. Where these two surfaces meet, the peripheral
hypoblast and the embryonic knob are connected together.

      Soon, however, the convex surface of the embryonic knob is seen to be
gradually converted into a cell layer, which remains in connection with the
peripheral hypoblast, but which gradually becomes separated from the rest of the
embryonic knob.

    An expanse of cells has then been interpolated into the primitive hypoblast of

the early didermic stages, in the region where the embryo is going to be evolved
i.e., in the region of the embryonic shield.

     As yet the epiblast is, however, not expanded into a shield, but folded together
in the embryonic knob. The first indication of its expansion is a dehiscence in
 the central portion of the knob, by which the hemispherical knob becomes con-
 verted into a hollow cup. The upper rim of this cup at the same time becomes
 confluent with the trophoblast that overcaps it, the convexity of the cup becomes
 lessened, and the trophoblast then no longer covers the embryonic epiblast.

 Finally, the convexity altogether disappears, the hollow cup surface is stretched,

and the flat or slightly curved embryonic shield has come into existence. The
hypoblast below the embryonic shield is much less flattened than the peripheral

 hypoblast.

     This may be called the final stage of the didermic blastocyst. It is directly
 comparable to the similar stage of other mammals, and somewhat more indirectly
 to that of the Sauropsida, with a considerable amount of food-yolk.

     The formation of mesoblast, with which we will not here occupy ourselves, is

 very soon inaugurated.
      The phenomena described above leave no doubt but that the wall of the tran-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                             683

sitorv monodermic stage is epiblastic in nature, and not bypoblastic, as Robinson
will "have it. The true hypoblast spreads out against its inner surface, much in

the same way as Van Beneden has described it for the rabbit. Van Beneden and
Julin for the bat, Heape for the mole, Selenka for the opossum, and the author for

the shrew. This conversion of the monodermic into a didermic stage is, however,

in Tupaja brought about in a stage when the dimensions of the blastocyst are

yet exceedinglv small.
      In conclusion the author pointed out that the early developmental stages here

sketched have confirmed him in the conviction that in the formation of the
mammalian blastocyst csenogenetic processes play a prominent part. It is by pre-
cocious segregation that cell-matter of epiblastic and of bypoblastic ancestry is
arranged into a two-layered vesicle, whereas the really formative matter out of
whicli the embryo will be built up is yet quiescent in the embryonic knob.

     This fact has made the mammalian blastocyst a very puzzling structure to com-

parative embryologists ; and we can only come to a clear conception of its real
nature if we are willing to acknowledge that the holoblastic segmentation of the
mammalian ovum is something totally diHerent from the holoblastic segmentation
of very many invertebrates and of Amphioxus, Being an apparently palin-
o-enetic feature, it is all the more misleading. And we must not wonder that the

fater processes of mesoblast formation have been afl'ected by the csenogenetic

changes just alluded to which have come about in the very early stages.

in 1892, and compared them with those of Litosiphon, founded in 1850 by
Harvey. The recently discovered plurilocular sporangia of Litosiphon Laminarice,
Harv., were described, and it was considered that the evidence aflbrded by their
position and characters with the dift'erences in the vegetative organs was sutHcient
to justify the continuance of Pof/otric/mm as a genus distinct from Litosiphon.
Lantern slides, microscopic and other illustrations, were shown.

(chalk-forming red algte) collected by him at ditJerent parts of the Irish coast
during the past three years. Preparations were shown of chains of spermatia form-
ing the antheridla in Lithophyllum (Melobesia) lichenoides, an<l attention was
called to their possible mode of formation. Specimens (microscopic. &c.) of shell-

described. Suggestions as to the relation of the carbonate of lime to the two groups
were made and asked for.

  2. On the Carpus of the Greenland Right-whale compared with those of
            Fin-whales. By Professor J. Struthers, M.I)., LL.D.

     In his preliminary notice in 1885 the author stated the general conclusion
that he found diminution in the number of bones in the second carpal row from
Hyperoodon to Mysticetiis. The following further observations relate to the
whalebone whales only. The species and number dissected were : two of Balmia
mystiretus, live of JSalcenoptcra musculus, one of B. horealis, two of B. rcsirata,
and one of Megajitera longimana.

     Besides noting the surface grooves, horizontal sections were made, showing the
lines of fibrous suture marking olf the limits of the cartilages and bringing into

view ossifications not seen on the surfaces. As the fibrous sutures uniting these
flat-walled cartilages are so narrow and firm as to prevent movement, these car-
tilages must be regarded as individually functionless, and we are prepared to find
differences between the species and variation among individuals of the same

species.

     In regard to the first row of the three usual mammalian pro-carpals in Mysti-
cetiis the intermedium sends up a peak between the forearm bones, articulating with
ulna as well as with radius, and the pisiform is widely separated from the ulnare,

 in both of these particulars contrasting with the finners.
      In the second row, instead of the usual four disto-carpals in mammals, Mysti-

 cetus has but one broad cartilage bone, supporting digits III. and II., and in part
 digit I. Digits IV. and V. are supported by the idnare, digit V. in part resting
 on the ulna, so that, on the ulnar side, the ulnare represents the entire carpus.

     The ossifcations in Mysticetus vary. In the 48-feet-long female, which may be

 reckoned adult or nearly so, the only bones ossified in the left cai-pus are the inter-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                               685

medium and ulnare, and largely so; in the riglit carpus an ossification occurs
also in the disto-carpal, of medium size. The radiale is not ossified in either carpus.

In the 35-feet-long male Mysticetus, in the right carpus (the left not obtained), tliree

ossifications occur, but they are in the radiale, the intermedium, and disto-carpal,

not in the ulnare. Moreover, in this two-thirds-grown Mysticetus the metacarpal

of the pollex is fully ossified, while in the adult the pollex is entirely cartila-

ginous.

     In the flnners, in the distal row, two cartilage bones, more or less ossified, occur
normally, supporting the two greatest digits. In the G.5^-feet-long B. musculus
these two are united into one bone, notches above and below and a groove on the
surface indicating synostosis of two formerly separate bones. In tbree of the five
B. muscuhis a disto-carpal was found supporting the inner of the four digits, car-
tilaginous in the 60-feet-long one and in the 60i-feet-long one, and with a small

ossification in the GoA-feet-long one. In the 45-f'eet-long one there was no trace
of this third disto-carpal, either bony or cartilaginous, nor was it present in the yC-
feet-long B. borealis, nor in either of the two adolescent B. rostrata.

     In the Meyfiptera, 40 feet long, the ulnare is a very broad bone, extending for
over one-third of its breadth below the radius, thus occupying also the locality of
an intermedium, and between it and the radiale occurs au undersized intermediate
bone. These two latter form the entire carpu«, as one row, between the radius and
the massive radial metacarpal. Small ossifications occur in the radiale and in the
ulnare to its ulnar side.

     The phifor7n is, in the great finners, large and square-shaped ; in B. rostrata,
narrow and directed npwards; in Mysticetus, transversely elongated. Rewarded
by some as merely a sesamoid, it serves as a stretcher, giving breadth to this broad
part of the limb, steadied by the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, which the author has
found to be present in all the cetacea he has dissected, whether whalebone or
toothed. In the 60^-feet-long B. miisrulus it had an ossification as large as a
walnut. The pisiform may be said to be the only one of these bones adapted to
serve a function. The mass of cartilage forming the carpus serves to give some
low flexibility and elasticity at that part of the limb, like a piece of firm india-
rubber in the middle of an oar ; but the mapping into distinct cartilage bones, more
or less ossified, in these whales can be explnined only on the view of inheritance
from some mammal whose diarthrodially jointed carpal bones were adapted to allow
of particular movements.

     The author reviewed the points of resemblance that obtained between the
Cupuliferae and the four chalazogamic genera, Alnus, Betula, Corylus, and Carpi-
nus, and was led to the conclusion that, with the exception of the difference in the
route of the pollen tube and the concomitant adaptations, no fundamental distinc-
tions could be drawn between the chalazogamic and porogamic genera.

                                    By Dr. O. Maas.

     In the question of the influence of temperature on marine animals no sufficient
distinction has been made hitherto between three classes of facts :

         1. Between the animals of the Plankton, the Benthos, and the Nekton.
         2. Between the vertical and the horizontal dift'erences of temperature.
         3. Betweeii eurythermal animals which can stand great dift'erences of tem-

                peratures, and the eurythermal ones which cannot.
The eurythermal animals cannot be appealed to in proof of anything regarding

temperature.
     For the stenothermal tlie average temperature of a locality is of small zoo-

geographical value, while the extent of variation is the most important factor.
     The Nekton animals are more eurythermal ; otherwise their power of swim-

ming, which brings them into very different conditions of temperature, would be

       The Plankton and Benthos animals are (with some exceptions discussed) more
  stenothermal ; hence results the known divitiion of the coasts.

     A distribution of the animals of the open ocean into regions is possible too,

  chiefly on account of the currents.
       Some instances of that were given from the facts of the Plankton expedition,

  chiefly of the Medusw, which have been worked out by Dr. Maas. Most interest-
  ing in this regard are the Geryonids, w/iich in every ocean basin do not exceed a
  certain N. or S. latitude, and which as PkiJikton animals occupy a similar

 portion of the map as the corals of the Benthos.
       Dr. Maas is led to the conclusion that a comparison between the vertical

  differences and those found in higher latitudes can only be carried to a limited
  depth.

       The horizontal distribution of the pelagic fauna is not compensated by the

  vertical difl'erences.

       There are no various belts of vertical life ; the intermediate fauna between the
  Plankton of the surface and the Benthos of the abyss maj' be supposed to be only
  Nekton.

      This is valid for the deep sea. In lower seas the life may be continuous from

 the surface to the bottom. Sometimes special conditions, especially of temperature,
 prevail {e.g., in the Mediterranean, where a depth of 2,000 m. shows 13°). The
 occurrence of a deep-sea pelagic fauna, neither belonging to the surface nor iu
 connection with the ground, as well as the survival of deep-sea animals coming

 to the surface, may be explained by this higher temperature.

 6. On Marine Fish-hatching and the Dunbar Establishment of the
   Fishery Board for Scotland. By Professor W. C. McIntosii, F.E.S.

     It was stated that we are yet in doubt as to the beneficial effects to the fisheries
of the artificial hatching of sea-fishes, hut that the importance of the issue demanded
 a thorough trial. Several nations, such as the Americans and Norwegians, had

chiefly experimented with the cod, other forms having., been dealt with in small
numbers. Though the sole was selected as the most suitable species, the lateness
 of its spawning period gave an opportunity for a preliminary series of experiments
with the plaice. Accordingly a total of 390 plaice Avere collected, the average
size of tlie males being about 17 inches, and that of the females about 20 inches.

From these 27,350,000 ova were obtained, hatched in the boxes (Dannevig's), and

-- --the larval plaice to the number of 20,000,000 sent into the sea, the loss in the

process being only about 4*4 per cent.

     At Dunbar the eggs are shed in the spawning-pond, and carried to the spawn-
collector by tlie current. They are then counted and placed in the hatching-
boxes. The sea-water for these is passed through a series of flannel-filters, so as to

secure purity. Moreover, besides the current entering the end of the box, an up-
and-down movement is communicated to tbem twice every minute, so that the ova

are evenly distributed through the water. On the whole the operations for the

lirst year were most successlul.'

3. On Social Insects and Evolution. By Professor C. V. Riley.

Experiment and discussion on the question as to whether acquired characters are

transmitted or not through heredity have of late heen largely based upon the

economies of insects, and especially of the social species. The author gives a
summary of what is known of the habits and economies of bees, wasps, ants, and

termites, especially as to the development of the young. He points out that the

origin of neuters, with their dlversitied forms, in these social insects has been con-

sidered one of the greatest difficulties with which the theory of natural selection has

had to contend. Weismann, in urging his own particular theories to account for the

variation which organisms have undergone, insists, and has, within the last year,

in his controversy with Herbert Spencer, emphasised his belief, that these neuter

insects absolutely preclude the idea of the transmission of acquired characters.

The author believes, on the contrary, and endeavours to show, that while these

neuters among social insects, with their varied structures and habits, do indeed oflfer

serious obstacles to the theory of natural selection as an all-sufficient theory to

explain the phenomena, these are nevertheless perfectly explicable upon the general

principles that have governed the modificaticm of organisms, among which natural

selection plays an important but limited part.

    Among the social Hymenoptera, where, as in the bees and wasps, the larva is

nursed and brought up in a definite cell or cradle, the three castes of male (or

drone), fertile female (or queen), and neuter (or worker) are quite definitely fixed

and separated. The difierences between the worker and the queen are, however,

solely due to the treatment of the larvre, and are consequently under the control of

the colony. The same larva, according to treatment and nurture, may produce

either a perfect queen or a worker, between which the diflFerences as to size, struc-

ture, external and internal organisation, and length of life are very great. This is

absolutely and definitely proved for the bees, and is doubtless equally true, though

with less absolute proof, of the wasps, in which the same three castes of male,

female, and neuter obtain in some species, while in others the neuters are replaced

by parthogenetic or unimpregnated females, normally capable of reproducing. In

the ants, where the larva is not confined to a definite cradle, and where there are,

in the more typical species, two castes of neuters, viz., soldiers and workers, the

variation between the different castes is greater, and there is also more variation in

the individuals composing  the different castes                                                                                         but  the evidence all  points  to the
                                                                                                                                     ;

fact that these different individuals are also the result of food and nurture, very

much as with the bees and wasps.

In the three families of social Hymenoptera above mentioned the young are

maggot-lilfe and absolutely helpless and dependent on the nurses. In the termites,

--which .belong to a different cider (Platyptera),* much older in time according to

 the palseontological record an order in which the young are born in the image of

--the parent and are more or less independent from birth one would expect to find

 larval nurture and environment less potent in influencing ultimate structure. Yet
 all the facts known, and particularly the late most painstaking observations and
 experiments of Grassi, prove conclusively that here, also, the young are dependent
 upon the nurses, and, more remarkable still, may be diverted, according to the food
 and treatment given, to any of the four castes which characterise the typical
 termite colony, there being, in addition to the male and female, two kinds of
 neuters, viz., soldiers and workers, as in the true ants. In the first larval stage, or
 when first hatched, the individuals are, to all appearances, absolutely alike, and each
 possesses the potentiality of becoming either a worker, or a soldier, or a perfect sexed

 individual. Nay, further, the pupse, or nymphs, may be diverted into reproductive

 forms which never acquire wings and which are called supplementary queens and

 kings; and even larvae may be so diverted into reproductive forms, with no further
 external structural development, when they become complementary or neotinic

 kings and queens.
      The steps in the development from the simpler to the more special structures

 and attributes belonging to the species with the most perfect social organisation

 may be traced in the diiferent species and genera of their respective families in all

 social insects of the present day. The amount of variation is often great in the
 ants and termites, where the environment is less fixed than in the bees and wasps,
 and this variation, among termites, is particularly manifest in the economy of the
same species, as exemplified in Euterines, which the author has studied in the West
 Indies, and in which the number of queens varies from one to nine or more. It is
 not generally known, but it is a fact, that existing termites (using the term in the

 broader sense, so as to include several genera) exemplify all the steps in develop-

 ment from species which are active in broad daylight (the neuters having faceted
 eyes and dark integument, and, so far as is known, no definite nest or termitary),
to the more specialised species in which the economy and division of labour are
 most perfect, and in which the neuters and soldiers are blind and always work in
 the dark and build elaborate structures. Further, the neuters in termites are truly
 without sex or are modified individuals which might have produced either sex
while in the Hymenoptera they are invariably modified females.

      In so fiir as these ditt'erent forms of neuter insects depend for their development
on the food and treatment given by the nurses, they are outside the domain of
natural selection. The author believes, however, that there is a potential, inherited
tendency in the young larva to develop in the various directions that have been
fixed for each species in its past development, as he cannot believe, e.//., that young
larvsB taken from one species of termites, and brought up under the care of the
nurses of any other species, can be diverted to the forms peculiar to this last. There
is a possibility, since the food of these young in the social insects consists largely of

secretions from the nurses, that these secretions may so influence the changes as to
confine them to the specific forms of its own specios, regardless of the parentage of
the young. That there can be any such powerful influence of nurture as would

neutralise and overcome the inherited tendencies of species is, however, extremely
improbable : its bare possibility opens up a most interesting field for experiment,
which is easily made, and doubtless soon will be made.

     The author believes, with Darwin, that ths variations in social insects have
been guided by natural selection among colonies, but that there has also been what
he calls social selection araoug individuals. Competition has been between colonies
rather than individuals, and those colonies which liave acquired, through heredity,
the habit of producing, from one or more fertile females, the diflerent castes

characteristic of the species have, in course of time, survived. He believes, how-

ever, that this colony-selection, as well as the social selection among individuals,
has been not only along lines that were and are useful to the species, but along lines
of secondary utility, and even along lines which are purely fortuitous and still most

variable and unfixed.
     Finally, as between Weismann's views and those held by Darwin himself, the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                 691

author feels that the facts furnished by the social insects strdngly favour the trans-

mission, through heredity, of acquired characters, both psychic and structural, but

that they also require other factors besides that of natural selection to explain them.

The trouble with all theories of reproduction and heredity based solely on em-

bryologic and microscopic methods is, that the essence, the life principle, the

potential factors, must always escape such methods. Any theory that will hold

--must cover the psychical as well as the physical facts the total of well-established
--experience and this truth was recognised by Darwin in framing his tentative

Wetheory of pangenesis.     are all in these matters simply discussing processes, and

the author believes that too much has been made of the cell theory, the cell being

but the medium through which assimilation, growth, organisation, regeneration, and

reproduction are effected by the ultimate elements and the inherited potential

forces, call them what we mav. The idea that the individual during its lifetime

develops all that is potential in the germ seems to him more philosophic than the

idea that the germ originates, at a specific moment of time, the tendency to all

that develops in the individual. It may be a perfectly correct conception, to use

"VVeismann's language, that the primary constituents for the characters of the

different forms of social insects are included in the egg, and that a particular form

of stimulus decides as to which group shall undergo development ; but it is diffi-

cult to believe, in the light of the facts which are known concerning social insects,

that the different kinds of ids and determinants which are thus conceived to

characterise the germ have not been impressed upon it as a consequence of the

characters, both acquired and congenital, of the parents.

The author finally calls attention to the significant fact that just as in man,

among Mammalia, the higher intellectual development and social organisation are

found correlated with the longest period of dependent infancy that this helpless
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

infancy has been, in fact, a prime influence in the development, through family,

clan, tribe, and state, of our highest organisation and civilisation; so in the insect

world we find the same correlation between the highest intelligence and dependent

infancy, and are justified in concluding that the latter is, in the social insects as in

man, in the same way a prime cause of the high organisation and division of labour

so characteristic of them.

4. Oti the R6le of Sex in Evolution. By John Berry Haycraft, M.D.,

                 Professor of Physiology, University College, Cardiff.

While Weismann admits that the power to vary is a property of protoplasm,

lie looks upon sexual conjugation as a means whereby the number of these
variations may be increased. But we find that the power to vary is itself a most

varying character of protoplasm, for both in the case of sexual and asexual

reproduction certain species constantly produce striking varieties, while others

Werarely produce them.      can therefore state, not only that variation is a quality

of protoplasm, but that it has and can acquire this quality in varying degree and

apart from sexual congregation ; moreover, greater varieties in the progeny can be

obtained simply by increasing the number of the offspring. It would appear

therefore that, if we accept the view held by Weismann, we must assign to sexual

conjugation a function already possessed by protoplasm, and it is difl[icult to under-

stand its utility. If, however, we remember that the varieties which occur in
newly allied forms (the only ones which conjugate) are variations chiefly in quantity

(diflPerences iu size of the whole or parts, amount of pigment, &c.), we can hardly

doubt the generally accepted and more popular view, that the children tend to the
mean of their parents ; a view supported by Galton's admirable researches. If this be

true sexual conjugation tends to diminish variations, and the author suggests that this

is indeed the role of sex in evolution. Our attention has been so much engrossed

with the changes of the environment, and with the consequent production and

establishment of new varieties, that we have perhaps con>idered too little the fact
that often for long periods of time the environment may remain stationary, and

that under these conditions existing types must remain stable. The persistently

preserved types in our inland ponds and lakes, types such as the housefly and cock-
roach, which for ages have remained the same, illustrate this stability. Living
matter must therefore be capable both of the power to vary and of stability ; tho
jirst it possesses, the second it gains by sexual conjugation, which tends to prevent
the slight deviations of a form which has become adapted to its environment from
producing still further deviation by blending them together so that some, at any

rate, of their progeny may preserve the useful ancestral qualities. To sex we owe
our fairly defined species and genera ; without sex we cannot doubt that life would
exist in the form of innumerable varieties that we should fail to group together.

     6. On the Relation of Mimetic Characters to the Original Form.
    By F, A. DiXEY, M.A., M.D., Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford.

    An objection that has been often brought against the theory of mimicry, as

enunciated by Bates and accepted by Darwin, is the difficulty of imagining th©

first stages in the production of a mimetic pattern. Fritz Miiller ' endeavoured to

meet this objection by alleging that mimicry chiefly originated between forms that

already bore considerable resemblance to each other. The main instance (that of

Leptalis melia) on which he relied in order to prove his point was not well chosen,

for there is reason to think that he was in error both in considering that it

represented the ancestral form of Leptalis and in supposing that it was not

protected by mimicry. Nevertheless, his contention is sound in so far as it

emphasises the fact that the process of mimetic assimilation depends rather on the

development of old than on the starting of new features.

    An illustration of this principle is afforded by a comparison of the non-

mimetic butterflies Pieris locusta and P. thaloe with the mimetic species of the

closely allied genus Mylothris, and with Heliconius numata, which serves as the

model for the latter ; all these forms inhabiting the same part of the neotropical

region. An almost perfect transition can be traced on the undersides from the

non-mimetic species of Pieris, through M. li/pera $ , M. lorena $ , M. pyrrha $ ,
M. lorena J , to M. pyrrha $ , this last butterfly being a very close copy of

Heliconius numata. The whole series shows (1) that a practically perfect

mimetic pattern can be evolved by gradual and easy stages without any violence

or  abruptness of change                                                                                   (2)  that  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  forms                                                   between

                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

80 small a beginning as the basal red patches on the underside of the hind-wing of

many Pierines gives eufiicient material for the assimilative process to work on.

    The feebler development of the mimetic pattern in the males of this group calls

for some explanation. No doubt the females require more protection, but does

there exist any active check on the fuller assumption of mimetic patterns by the

males P The retention of the original white by the latter sex has been in similar

instances attributed to female choice ; Mr. Wallace, on the other hand, thinks it
due to the difference of habits in the two sexes, the females alone flying in

company with the mimicked Heliconii. But this leaves unexplained the presence

of a partial mimetic pattern in the male. The probability is that, although on the

·wing it may be advantageous rather than otherwise to the male, as Mr, Wallace

thinks, to be taken for an ordinary white butterfly, yet when the insect is at rest and

settled with the wings erect, any Heliconine resemblance would be to some extents

protective; and the whole aspect of these males, the underside alone of which shows

any mimetic features, is the resultant of these two divergent tendencies. The mimetic

features of the male cannot be regarded as a mere incidental result of the more com-

plete transformation of the female, because in many species of other groups the female

is completely mimetic while the male shows no approach whatever to a mimetic

change                                 moreover, there is                                                  a species of Hesperocharis      (IL hirlanda)  in which not
                                    ;

only the male but both sexes show a partial mimetic pattern no further advanced

than that of M. lorena $ or M. pyrrha ^. It is difiicult to believe that in thia

case the pattern is not in some degree protective.

                                                                                                           ' Jenaitch. Zeitschr., vol. x.

     Red basal spots like those of the mimicking Pierines are in some cases found

in the mimicked Heliconii: this is especially the case in those that form models
for the Pierine genera Euterpe and Fereute. These spots are too widespread in
the Pierine sub-family to have arisen from imitation of the Heliconii; their
presence in the latter is probably due to ' reciprocal mimicry ' between distasteful

forms, as suggested by the author in ' Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond.,' 1894, p. 298.

   A curious ease of a mimetic group is afforded by the Pierines Euteiye critias

and E. bellona, together with their respective models Papilio zacynthics and the
Heliconii of the thel.viope group. The Papilio and the Heliconii have no close
resemblance to each other, but appear to be held together, as it were, by the
intermediate Pierines. If the Heliconii are considered as the models for the whole

group, the question arises why E. critias should copy a mimic, and not a very good
one, instead of the original distasteful model. It is more probable that here also we

have an instance of an ' inedible association ; ' this conclusion being strengthened by
the fact that a certain amount of ' give and take,' or 'reciprocal mimicry,' seems to

tave occurred between the Pierines and the Papilio,

7. On the Wing of Archceopteryx Vietced in the Light of that of Some
                       Modern Birds. By W. P. Pycraft.

In this paper the author contended that certain of the Galliformes, such as the

common fowl and turkej' for instance, are descended from an ancestral form of

a strictly arboreal habit, in which the pollex and index digits were armed with

claws to assist in climbing as well as to save itself from falling. These claws

remained functional until a sufficient number of the primary (and secondary)

i-eiuiges had developed to convert the wing into an organ of iiight. Until this was

eflected, the development of these remigea nearest the wing (Nos. 8, 9, 10) was

arrested, so that the tip of the index digit might be left free for grasping. The

arrested development of the remiges referred to is the only clue we have left at

the present day, the claw of the second digit having been lost, whilst that and the

pollex are very small. These deductions were drawn from a precisely similar

arrangement shown by the author to exist in Ojnsthocomus cristatus, a bird which

shows many other unmistakably primitive characters.

     It was also pointed out that there is reason for believing that the claws of

--Archaeopteryx were of prime importance only during a similar period of life the
Anestling period.
                   restoration in the shape of a model of the wing of Archajopteryx

was exhibited, in which it was shown that the remiges rested upon the third digit,

so as to leave the tip of the second free in a manner more or less resembling the

nestling condition of Opistkocomus. It was, however, pointed out by the author

that this digit might have supported the semiplume-like feathers seen in the fossil,

overlying the quill feathers. These may have possibly extended to the tip of the

                        By Professor G, Gilson, of Louvain.

     Orvenia is a tubicolous annelid discovered by Delle Chiaje in the Gulf of
Naples, and especially studied by Claparede. The latest writer on its anatomy,
Dr. von Drasche, confesses his ignorance as to the presence or absence of the
nephridia, as well as to the way through which the genital products are led out of
the ccelom.
--694 REPORT 1894.

Although my own researches are far from terminated, I am aWe to give some

information on the subject.

In fact, the nephridial system is not altogether absent, but is in a state of

extreme reduction and seems to have lost all secretory function. It consists
usually of one pair, sometimes two pairs, of very small funnels, lying in the
posterior part of the sixth segment, against the muscular layer, in an extremely

dorsal position.

     Each of these funnels ends in a very thin tube, which passes through the
muscular coat ; but, instead of opening directly and freely on the epidermic
surface, these tubes fall into a longitudinal duct which runs forward and opens,
through a tiny pore, at the other end of the sixth segment.

This      duct  is  a  merely epithelial  structure                                      it  lies  outside  of  the  thick  basal
                                                                                      ;

membrane, within the epiderm itself. Being thus superficially situated, it is

exteriorly visible, and appears as a very sinuous line, extending the whole length
of the sixth segment. Dr. von Drasche, in his valuable monograph, very accu-
rately represented this line, though he did not make out its significance.

1 have seen this epithelial duct opening at certain places, thus taking the shape

of a groove instead of that of a tube. These occasional imperfections of its
structure, together with the peculiar disposition of its constituent cells, show that
this canal originates as a longitudinal folding of the epithelium. They lead u»

also to consider it as an organ still in full course of pbylogenetic evolution. Its

utility, as well as the original cause of its formation, is obvious. I have shown
elsewhere that the sandy tube in which the Oioenia lives is rather tight round the
fore end of the body. The genital products could scarcely reach the exterior were

they directly ejected into the space between the worm and its protective sheath.

The animal is obliged to protrude its body out of its dwelling, but, thanks to the
epidermic canal, it is spared the trouble and danger of laying bare more than its

five anterior segments, though the funnels lie in the posterior part of the sixth.

   A question now presents itself: What is th^ morphological significance of

this epidermic duct ?

my myIt is not
                    intention, in the present state of                                             researches, to enter into a

full discussion of the subject. I shall content myself with calling attention to the

bearing which the discovery of the epidermic canal of Owenia may have on the

discussion of the homologies of the excretory system in general.

   We know other instances of a longitudinal duct in connection with the

nephridia. The most classical one is that of Lanice conchilega, described by
Mr. Cunningham and Dr. E. Meyer.

     The longitudinal duct of this species is generally regarded as an unsegmented

--part of the longitudinal row of cells which gives origin to the excretory system an

opinion which I have no reason to oppose.
     But certain morphologists go further than that, and compare the longitudinal

duct of Lanice, Polymmia, Polygordius, and others to the segmental canal or primi-

tive ureter of vertebrates. Professor Wilson, in his remarkable paper on the germ-
bands of Lwnbricus, goes even so far as to consider this homology as evident.

    On this point I venture to recall attention to Professor Haddon's hypothesis

as to the pbylogenetic origin and epiblastic nature of the segmental duct of

vertebrates.

     The existence of such an evidently adaptive structure as the epidermic duct of
Oiuenia seems to give a remarkable confirmation to his suggestion as to how a
continuous groove into which the nephridia opened may have been converted into

a canal.

It is not evident at all that the segmental duct really Is, in its whole length,

an unsegmented part of a cell-row homologous to that of Clepsine or Lumhricus.

It may have appeared at a much later period of the pbylogenetic evolution, and
have been, at a given moment, a new structure corresponding to new wants, just

as the epidermic duct of Ojcenia corresponds to a peculiar disposition of the pro-

tective tube of the worm. The coexistence of a segmental duct analogous to the

epithelial duct of Owenia, and of a structure homologous to the longitudinal canal

of Lanice, is even possible.

     I do not afBrm that the epidermic duct of Oivenia really represents the
segmental duct at an early stage of its phylogenetic development. I rather

think that we have here a case of homoplasy, not of homogeny. But I believe

that the homology of the primitive ureter is not a settled question, as the
American professor would have it, but that it remains a question open to further

investigation.

         1. On the Origin of the Sexual Organs of the Pteridophytes.
                       By Professor Douglas H. Campbell.

     While the close affinity of the Bryophytes and PteridopTiytes has been long
recognised in the origin and early divisions of the sexual org:ans, there exist
differences that have been looked upon as radical. This is especially noticeable in

the archegonium.

   A comparison of the structure and development of the sexual organs of the

higher hepatics (Anthocerotije) with those of the Eusporangiate Pteridophytes,
i.e., Opbioglosaefe, MarattiaceiB, Equisetinete, and Lycopodinese, shows remarkable
points of resemblance, enough to warrant the hypothesis that here is to be sought
the connection between the Bryophytes and Pteridophytes.

       2. Notes upon the Germination of the Sjyores of the Ophioglossece.

                       By Professor Douglas H. Campbell.

     Tfie gametophytic stage of these plants is very imperfectly known, and hitherto
only the very advanced conditions in two species.

     The author succeeded in germinating two other species Ophioglossum (Ophto-
derma) pendidwn and Botrychium virginicum. In both the iirst division of the
spore occurs before any chlorophyll is formed.

     The author also found old prothallia of B. virginicum with young plants
attached, but too far advanced to study the development of the reproductive
organs and embryo.

           3. On Sterilisation and a Theory of the Strohilus.
                    By Professor P. O. Bower, F.R.S.

DIn submitting a theory of the strcibilus to Section   it is assumed that

Hofmeister's general conclusions will be accepted, that antithetic alternation

was constant throughout the evolution of archegoniate plants, and that the

sporopbyte has been the result of elaboration of the zygote. The main points of

--the theory may be briefly stated as follows :

1. Spore-production was the first office of the sporophyte : its spore-bearing

parts are to be regarded as primary, its vegetative parts as secondary in point of

evolutionary history.

2. Other things being equal, increase in number of carpospores is an ad-

Avantage.  climax of numerical spore-production was attained in homosporoua

vascular cryptogams.

3. Sterilisation of potential sporogenous tissue has been and is a widespread

phenomenon, appearing as a natural consequence of increased spore-production.

4. Parts of the sterile tissue appeared as septa, partitioning off the remaining

sporogenous tissue into separate loculi.

6. Septation to form synangia and subsequent separation of the sporangia aie

phenomena illustrated in the upward development of vascular plants.

    6. Such fieptatlon may have taken place repeatedly in the same line of descent.
     7. The sporogonial head as a whole is the correlative of the strobilus or

flower, and the apex of the one corresponds to the apex of the other.
     8. The progression from the one to the other depended upon (a) septation by

formation of sterile partitions, (b) eruption of the surface to form appendicular
organs upon -which the sporangia are supported (sporangiophores, sporophylls).

     9. The sporophylls, originally small and of simple form, were in the course of
descent susceptible of great increase in size and complexity of form.

           1. On the Blood o/Magelona. By "W. B. Benham, D.Sc.

      The blood of this annelid diflers entirely from that of any other chretopod
 hitherto examined. Instead of a red (hff:moglobinous) liquid plasma, in which
 float a few nucleated (colourless) corpuscles, or free nuclei, the blood-vessels of
 Magelona are completely filled with very small spherical globules of a madder-pink
 colour, floating in an extremely small amount of colourless plasma. These globules
 are not cells ; there are free nuclei scattered amongst them, but the coloured
 globules are not nucleated. The colour of the globules is due to a pigment similar
 to hsemerythrin ; the globules themselves, when shed, exhibit a marked tendency
 to run together like oil-drops and fuse with one another. This peculiar and
 rather viscous mass seems to be intermediate, in some respects, between the abso-
 lutely liquid, coloured plasma of chsetopods generally and the red corpuscles of
 mammals, which float in a comparatively small amount of colourless plasma;
 further, the globules in Magelona probably originate, as those of- mammals do,
  within cells, from which they are released.

           2. Suggestions for a New Classification of the Polychseta.
                               By W. B. Benham, D.Sc.

   --The PolychcBta may be divided into two grades (a) the Eucephala, in which

  the prostomium retains its original condition as a lobe overhanging the mouth,
  and the peristomium shows no tendency to overgrow it. The body segments are

  all alike. The second grade (6) may be called Cryptocephala, as the peristomium

  grows forward and fuses with, or even entirely conceals, the prostomium, which is
  greatly reduced. The body segments are diflierentiated into two groups, indicated
  externally by the sudden alteration of the chfetfe, and internally by certain

   diflerences.

       The JEucephala includes four sub-orders :

    --Sub-order 1. The Nereidiformia ( = Errantia, auct.) together with Ariciidm. In

  this group, with a few exceptions, the prostomium carries tentacles and palps, and

the peristomium usually carries special cirri. The parapodia are well-developed

lobes, supported by stroug acicula. The chretse are jointed (gomphotrichs) or un-
Ajointed (bolotrichs) ; no uncini occur.
                                          pharynx exists, which frequently is armed

with jaws. There are other characters drawn from internal organs.

Sub-order 2. Scoleciformia includes the four families Opheliidm, Arenicolidce,

Scalihreymidiv, and Maidanid(i>.
     The prostoniium does not carry tentacles or palps, the peristomium is without

special cirri. The parapodia are biit feebly developed knobs or ridges, and are not

supported by acicula. The chtetaj are holotrichs. Sensory processes feebly deve-
loped or absent. Internally the most marked feature is the diminution in

number of the nephridia connected with the incomplete character of the septa.
There are no jaws, though the anterior end of the gut may be eversible.

  --Sub-order '.'>. Terebellifonnia (Families. Cirratulida, Chhrhannidcp, 8terna-

spidcB, Tenbellida:, &c.).--The prostoniium carries tentacular appendages (the
branchial processes of Chlorhcemida:). The acbretous peristomium may carry fila-

mentous processes. Parapodia, mere ridges or knobs ; no acicula ; chtetse are

holotrichs and uncini. IJorsal cirri may be present on a few of the anterior

segments, and they function as gills. Buccal region not eversible. Internally

the nephridia present a dimorphism, accompanied in many cases by reduction in

number.

Sub-order 4. CapiteUiformia includes the family Capttellida.

The second grade, Cri/pfocep/ia!a, is divided into two sub-orders :

Sub-order 1. Spioni'fonnia (Families Spionidce, Magelonidce, Chcetopteridce,

Ammocharidce) retains the prostomium as a small lobe, without definite tentacles

or palps, but the peristomium is relatively large, and extends forwards on either side
of the prostomium ; this segment usually carries very long flexible tentacles. The
parapodia are only feebly developed and incomplete ; no acicula ; the chsetse holo-

trichs ; uncini may occur. Dorsal cirri, if preseut, become branchial organs. Buccal

region eversible, but without jaws. Nephridia but imperfectly known.

     Sub-order 2. Sahelliformia [Sabellidce, Erknjraplddcc, Serpulidrp. Hermellidce).

The prostomium is in most cases entirely concealed by the great development of
the peristomium, and may be reduced to mere sensory knobs. But the palps are

very greatly developed and function as gills. Parapodia only slightly projecting,

or mere ridges; chfetfe holotrichs and uncini. Dorsal cirri, if present, are

--branchial, or modified to form a thoracic membrane. Nephridia dimorphic the

anterior pair large, opening by a median dorsal pore on the first segment. The

remainder act as genital ducts.

                  By Thomas R. R. Stebbing, M.A.

Modern zoology is a study of continually extending scope. The literature is

vast, costly, and polyglot. The channels of publication are so innumerable that

naturalists can scarcely tell which way to turn. In books, in magazines, in

reports of learned societies, the information required by one set of students is

often so combined with that required by several other sets that the expense of

obtaining it becomes prohibitory. The proposal is hazarded that the leading

societies should set an example by arranging among themselves for a division of

labour, in the hope that by degrees scientific workers might be induced to issue

their new discoveries from a few well-recognised centres, instead of insisting on

Athe present liberty of ubiquitous publication.  Committee of the British Associa-

tion, it is suggested, might usefully undertake a preliminary consideration of what

is possible or expedient in this respect ; and, while ventUating the larger subject,

might also propose a settlement of some debated questions of zoological nomencla-

   7. On the Epidermis of the Plantar Surface and the Question of Use-
Inheritance. By F. A. DiXEY, M.D., Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford.

     It is well Imown that in the human adult the skin of the sole of the foot is
thickened as compared -with that of the dorsum, and it is also known that this

local thickening on the plantar surface is present before birth. It is therefore not
the direct result of the use of the sole in walking, though it might possibly be held
to be due to use-inheritance. But in addition to the general plantar thickening,

there is also known to exist a special thickening, in the adult, of the skin covering
the heel and toe-ball, which is no doubt correlated with the heel-and-toe gait
specially characteristic of man. It was suggested by the late Professor Romanes
that it would be of importance to ascertain the time of appearance of this special
as distinct from the general plantar thickening, inasmuch as its appearance before
birth, should that be proved to occur, would seem to be more easily accounted for
on the principle of use-inheritance than on that of pure natural selection. The
general plantar thickening in the embryo might be held to be simply representative
of the condition in a prehuman ancestor ; not so, however, the special thickening of
the heel and toe-ball. Six embryos, whose ages varied from about the third to the
ninth month, were examined in concert with Professor Romanes. As the inner
limit of the coriuni is in most cases not exactly determinable, the epidermis alone

--was measured, and the results were as follows: (1) The general plantar thickening

had begun in the earliest embryo examined. (2) The special thickening of the
toe-ball had also begun at the same age. (3) The special thickening of the heel
was not discoverable in any one of the specimens, which ranged up to the time
just preceding birth. These results were unexpected, for it had been anticipated
that both the special thickenings would have been found in the embryo to be either
absent or present together, and at first sight it seemed as if no light were thrown
by the observed facts on the question at issue. On further consideration, however,
and after special study of the gait of the lower primates, it appeared to the author
that the thickened epidermis of the toe-ball in the embryo simply represented an

ancestral condition when the gait resembled that of most monkeys, who walk, as a

 rule, with the heel raised from the ground, only using the whole length of the sole

when resting or squatting. The phenomenon would, therefore, seem to admit of a
 far more easy explanation under the theory of natural selection pure and simple

 than under that of use-inheritance.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

     The President delivered the following Address :

You will not be surprised if, having called upon an hydrographer to preside over

this Section, he takes for the subject of his review the Sea. Less apparently
interesting, by reason of the uniformity of its surface, than the land which raises

itself above the level of the waters, and with which the term geography is more
generally associated, the ocean has, nevertheless, received much attention of late
years. In Great Britain, especially, which has so long rested its position among
the nations upon the wealth which our merchant fleets bring to its shores, and
upon the facilities which the sea affords for communication with our numerous
possessions all over the globe, investigation into the mysteries, whether of its ever-
moving surface or of its more hidden depths, has been particularly fascinating. I
purpose, therefore, to attempt a brief survey of our present knowledge of its

physical condition.

     The very bulk of the ocean, as compared with that of the visible land, gives it
an importance which is possessed by no other feature on the surface of our planet.
Mr. John Murray, after a laborious computation, has shown that its cubical extent
is probably about fourteen times that of the dry land. This statement appeals
strongly to the imagination, and forms, perhaps, the most powerful argument in
favour of the view, steadily gaining ground, that the great oceans have in the

main existed in the form in which we now see them since the constituents of the
earth settled down into their present condition.

    When it is considered that the whole of the dry land would only fill up one-

third of the Atlantic Ocean, the enormous disproportion of the two great divisions
of land and sea becomes very apparent.

     The most obvious phenomenon of the ocean is the constant horizontal move-
ment of its surface waters, which in many parts take well-defined directions.
These great ocean currents have now been studied for many years, and our know-
ledge of them is approaching a point beyond which it is doubtful whether we shall
ever much advance, except in small details. For though, while indisputably the
waters continually move in each great area in generally the same direction, the
velocities vary, the limits of the different streams and drifts vary, mainly from the
ever-varying force and direction of the winds.

    After long hesitation and much argument, I think it may be now safely held

that the prime motor of the surface currents is the wind. Not, by any means, the

wind that may blow, and even persistently blow, over the portion of water that is

moving, more or less rapidly, in any direction, but the great winds which blow
generally from the same general quarter over vast areas. These, combined with
deflection from the land, settle the main surface circulation.

    I do not know if any of my hearers may have seen a very remarkable model,
700 REPORT-- 1894.

devised by Mr. Clayden, in which water disposed over an area shaped like the
Atlantic, and sprinkled over with lycopodium dust to make movement apparent,
was subjected to air impelled from various nozzles, representing the mean direc-
tions of the permanent winds. It dispelled the last doubt I held on the subject, as
not only were the main currents reproduced, but the smaller effects and pecu-
liarities of the Atlantic drifts were produced with surprising accuracy.

     There is a small current, long shown on our charts, but which I had always
regarded with suspicion. I refer to the stream which, after travelling from the
Arctic Ocean southward along the east coast of Greenland, turns sharply round
Cape Farewell to the northward into Davis Straits, where it again doubles sharply
on itself to the southward. This is exhibited, in the model, in all its details, and
is evidently caused by the pressure of the water forced by the mimic Gulf Stream
into the Arctic region, where it has no escape except by this route, and is pressed
against the land, round which it turns as soon as it can. This is, no doubt, the

«xplanation of the real current.

     The very remarkable winter equatorial current, which runs in a narrow belt
eastwards, just north of the main stream travelling west, was also reproduced with

extraordinary fidelity.

     The winds, however, that are ordinarily considered permanent vary greatly,
while in the monsoon areas the reversal of the currents caused by the opposite winds
exercise a great influence on the movements of the water far beyond their own limits,
and anything like a prediction of the precise direction and rate of an oceanic stream
can never be expected.

     The main facts, however, of the great currents can be most certainly and simply

explained in this manner.
      The trade winds are the prime motors. They cause a surface drift of no great

velocity over large areas iu the same general direction as that in which they blow.
These drifts after meeting and combining their forces eventually impinge on the

land.

      They are diverted and concentrated and increase in speed. They either pour
through passages between islands, iis into the Caribbean Sea, are pressed up by

--the land, and escape by the only outlets possible as, for example, the Strait of
--Florida, and form a great ocean current like the Gulf Stream or, as in the case of

the Agulhas current and the powerful stream which runs north along the Zanzibar
 coast, they are simply pressed up against and diverted by the land, and run along it
 with increased rapidity.

       These rapid currents are eventually apparently lost in the oceans, but they in
 their turn originate movements of a slower character, which on again passing over
 Bhallow water or on meeting land develop once more into well-defined currents.

    We find an analogous state of things on the western side of the Pacitic, where

 the Japan current is produced in a similar manner.
      The fact that on all western shores of the great oceans towards which the trade

 winds blow we find the strongest currents running along the coast, is almost enough

 of itself to prove the connection between them.
      The westerly winds that prevail in higher northern and southern latitudes are

 next in order in producing great currents. From the shape of the land they in
 Gome ca«es take up and continue the circulation commenced by the trade winds ; in
 others they themselves originate great movements of the water.

      Compared to the great circulation from this source the effect of differences of
 temperature or of specific gravity is insignificant, though no doubt they play their
 part, especially in causing slow under-circulation, and in a greater degree the
 vertical mixing of the lower waters.

     No drop of the ocean, even at its greatest depth, is ever for one moment at rest.

      Dealing with minor points, the American ofiicers of the Coast and Geodetic
 Survey have found after long and patient iuvestigation that the velocity of the Gulf
 Stream in its initial and most marked part, the Strait of Florida, is greatly affected

 by the tide, varying as much as one-half its maximum rate during the twenty-four

 hours.

      These American investigations are of greatest interest. They have extended over
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  701

the whole area of the Caribbean Sea and its approaches, the Gulf of Mexico, and the
Gulf Stream proper and its vicinity. In no other part of the ocean has observation
of this detailed character been carried out, and they throw a great light on
oceanic circulation. The ' Blake,' the vessel specially fitted for the purpose, has dur-
ing the several years in which she was employed on this work anchored in over
2,000 fathoms water, or a depth of considerably more than two miles ; a feat which
would a short time ago have been deemed impossible.

     One great point tbat has come out very strongly is the continual variation in
the strength and direction of the currents, and the varying depths to which the

surface current extend.

     Eastward of the chain of the Windward Islands the general depth of the sur-
face movement may be said to be about 100 fathoms, below which tidal influence

is very distinct.
     There is also a very plain backward flow of water, at depths which varj"-,

caused by the submarine ridge which connects the Windward Chain of the West
Indian Islands. These observations also generally support what I have already

mentioned : that the velocity of a current depends on the strength of winds, pos-
sibly thousands of miles distant, which have given tlie original impetus to the

water, and this, combined with tidal action when the current approaches or runs

along a coast, will always cause uncertainty on the resultant velocity.

     Dealing for yet another moment with the Gulf Stream, there are two points,
which have not been much dwelt upon, but which have a great effect on its power
of bringing the modifying influence of its warm water as far as our shores.

     The first is the prevention of its spreading, as it leaves the Strait of Florida,
by the pressure of the portion of the equatorial current which, unable to got
through the passages between the Windward Islands, is diverted to the north of
the Bahamas, and bears down on the eastward side of the Gulf Stream proper,,
compressing it between itself and the cold water flowing southward along the
American coast, and at the same time adding to its forces and maintaining its

high temperature.

     The second is that by the time the Gulf Stream has lost its velocity as a
current, in about the vicinity of the Banks of Newfoundland, it has arrived in the
region of the westerly winds, that is of winds whose average direction is from
west; whose influence, causing a surface drift somewhat comjparable to that of the
trade winds, bears the water onward to the British Islands and Norway. Without

these prevailing westerly winds the warm water of the Gulf Stream would never

 reach these shores.

      The depth to which the surface currents extend in other parts is little known.

Direct observations on under-currents have been rare.
      In the first place, it is not an easy observation to make. Apparatus has gene-

rally to be improvised. This has usually consisted of some form of flat surface
lowered to the required depth, and suspended in the water by a buoy, which
presents to the resistance of the upper stratum a very much smaller area than that

of the surface below.

      More perfect machines have been devised, notably, that used by the Americana
in their West Indian experiments.

     These, however, are delicate, and require so much care and experience in work-
ing, and so much time is wanted for such observations, that under the pressure of
the more urgent requirements on surface movements in the interests of navigation

 very little has been done.

      The ' Challenger ' made some observations on the depth of the equatorial
 current in mid-Atlantic, but they were not very conclusive for lack of suitable
appliances. They, however, tended to show that below 100 fathoms there was but

 little current.

      It has been calculated theoretically that winds blowing steadily in one direction
with the ordinary force of the trade winds would in 100,000 years by friction
 between the particles put the whole of a mass of water 2,000 fathoms deep, not
 otherwise influenced, into motion in that direction ; but the direction and force of

 the trade winds are ever changing, and the actual strong currents of the ocean are

not in tlie trade wind areas, but are the result of these drifts meeting one another
Weand being compressed by the conformation of the land.
                                                               cannot, therefore,

expect this theoretical effect to be realised.

One instance of the underrunning of one current by another is brought very

plainly to our notice in the North Atlantic, to the east of the Great Bank of
Newfoundland, where the icebergs borne by the arctic current from Baffin Bay

pursue their course to the southward across the Gulf Stream running eastward.

These great masses of ice, floating with seven-eighths of their volume under the

surface, draw so much water that they are all but wholly influenced by the under-

Acurrent.  large berg will have its bottom as much as six or seven hundred feet

below the surface. The only reason that these bergs continue their journey south-

ward is the action of the cold under-current.

    It was my good fortune to be ordered in 1872 to undertake a series of experi-

ments of the currents and iinder-currents of the Dardanelles and Bosporus. They

proved most interesting.

It was well known that a surface stream is almost continuously passing out of

the Black Sea through the Bosporus into the Sea of Marmara, and again through

W.the Dardanelles into the INlediterranean. Certain physicists, of whom Dr.

Carpenter was one, were, however, of opinion that a return current would be found

under the surface running in the opposite direction, and this I was enabled to

demonstrate.

    Though from the imperfection of our apparatus, which we had to devise on the

spot, we were unable to exactly proportionate the quantities of water moving in the
two directions, we found, whenever the surface current was rushing south-westward

through these straits, that for a certain distance, from the bottom upwards, the

water was in rapid motion in the opposite direction. It was an astonishing sight

to behold the buoys which supported a wooden framework of 36 square feet area,

lowered to depths from 1 00 to 240 feet, tearing up the straits against a strong surface
current of as much as three and four miles an hour. It was as perfect an ocular

denion.stration of a counter imder-current as could be wished, and the Turks, who

watched our proceedings with much suspicion, were strongly of opinion that the

Devil had a hand in it, and only the exhibition of the Sultan's firman saved us from

interruption. In the investigation of these currents we found, as usual, that the

wind was the most potent agent. Though the surface water from the Black Sea

is almost fresh, and the bottom water of the heavy Mediterranean density of 1'027,

it was found tbat when calm had prevailed the surface current slackened, and at

times became nil, whilst the imder-current responded by a similar slackening.

The ordinary condition of wind in the regions of the Black Sea and Sea of

Marmara is that of a prevalent N.E. wind. This causes a heaping up of the water

on the south-west shores of those seas, precisely where the straits open, and the

surface water therefore rapidly escapes.

     These straits no doubt present abnormal characters, but, so far as surface currents

are concerned, the long series of observations then made convinced me of the

inadequacy of differences of specific gravity, which were here at a maximum, to

cau«e any perceptible horizontal flow of water.

    I have said that we were unable to define by direct observation the exact

position of the dividing line between the opposing currents, but the rapid change

in the specific gravity at a certain depth, which varied on diflerent days, gave a

strong indication that the currents changed at this point.

   A Russian officer, Captain Makaroff", afterwards made similar expei'iments in

t^ie Bosporus, but witii more perfect appliances, and he found that at the point

where the specific gravity changed the currents also changed.

     J have been anxious to obtain similar observations at the Straits of Bab-el-

Mand^h, the southern outlet of the Eed Sea, where somewhat similar conditions

prevail. Here the winds are governed by the monsoons. For half the year the

wind blows from the north down the whole length of the sea, causing a surface

flow outwards into the Gulf of Aden, and a general lowering of the whole level of

the sea of about two feet. For the other half of the year the wind at the southern

end of the sea is strong from the south-east, causing a surface set into the Red Sea,
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  703

over, wliich the general level of the water rises, while the northerly wind continues

to blow throughout the northern half.

     At either of these times I think it is highly probable that there is an under-

current in the opposite direction to that at the surface, but unfortunately the sea
disturbance is great and observations are very difficult.

    Observations were, however, made by Captain W. U. Moore in II.M.S.

' Penguin ' in 1890, but at a time when the change of monsoon was tailing place.
     The result was peculiar, for it appeared that at a depth of about 360 feet

--the movement of the water was tidal, while the surface water was moving slowly

in one direction a result generally similar to that obtained by the Americans in
the West Indies--but the direction of the tidal flow was directly opposite to what
might have been expected, viz., the water ran in while the tide fell, and vine versa.

     More observations are, however, needed here before any certain conclusions can

be formed.

     The depth of the ocean is the next great feature which demands attention.
     On this our knowledge is steadily, though slowly, increasing.

     The whole of it has been gained during the last tifty years.
     Commenced by Sir James Ross, whose means were very small, but who never-
theless demonstrated that the so-called unfathomable ocean was certainly fathomable

everywhere, the sounding of the ocean has continuously proceeded. The needs of
submarine cables have constantly demanded knowledge in this particular, and the
different cable companies have had a large share in ascertaining the facts.

     Expeditions, whose main object has been to obtain soundings, have been sent
out. Great Britain and the United States taking the first place ; but moat maritime

nations have aided.

     In the immediate past the additions have mainly been from the soundings
which H.M. surveying ships continually take whenever on passage from one
place to another, from the work of our cable companies, and from United States

vessels.

    We have, as a result, a very fair general knowledge of the prevailing depths in
Wethe Atlantic, but of the Indian and Pacific Oceans it is very fragmentary.

have enough to give us a general idea, but our requirements increase as years

roll on. It is a vast task, and, it may be safely said, will never be completed ; for
we shall never be satisfied until we know the variations of level under the water
as well as we know those on the dry land.

     It is hopeless to do more than to briefly sketch the amount of our knowledge.
     First, as to the greatest depths known. It is very remarkable, and from a
geological point of view significant, that the very deepest parts of the ocean are

not in or near their centres, but in all cases are very near land.

     One hundred and ten miles outside the Kurile Islands, which stretch from the
northern point of Japan to the north-east, the deepest sounding has been obtained
of 4,655 fathoms, or 27,930 feet. This appears to be in a deep depression, which
runs parallel to the Kurile Islands and Japan ; but its extent is unknown, and
may be very large.

     Seventy miles north of Porto Rico, in the West Indies, is the next deepest cast
known, viz., 4,561 fathoms, or 27,366 feet ; not far inferior to the Pacific depth, but
here the deep area must be comparatively small, as shallower soundiajs have
been made at distances sixty miles north and east of it.

    A similar depression has been sounded durinar the last few years west of the

great range of the Andes, at a distance of fifty miles from the coast of Peru, where
the greatest depth is 4,175 fathoms.

      Other isolated depths of over 4,000 fathoms have been sounded iu the Pacific.

One between the Tonga or Friendly Islands of 4,500 fathoms, one of 4,478 fathoms
near the Ladrones, and another of 4,428 fathoms npar Pylstaart Island, all in the
W'e.'itern Pacific. They all require further investigation to determine their extent.

      With these few exceptions, the depth of the oceans, so far as yet known, nowhere
comes up to 4,000 fathoms, or four sea miles; but there can "be little doubt that

 other similar hollows are yet to be found.

     The sea with the greatest mean depth appears to be the vast Pacific, which
--704 REPORT 1894.

covers 67 millions of the 188 millions of square miles composing tHe earth's

surface.

     Of these 188 millions, 137 millions are sea, so that the Pacific comprises just
one-half of the water of the globe, and more than one-third of its whole area.

The Northern Pacific has been estimated by Mr. John Murray to have a mean

depth of over 2,500 fathoms, while the Southern Pacific is credited with a little

under 2,400 fathoms. These fijrures are based on a number of soundings which

cannot be designated otherwise than very sparse.

To give an idea of what remains to be done, I will mention that in the eastern

part of the Central Pacific there is an area of 10,500,000 square miles in which

there are only seven soundings, whilst in a long strip crossing the whole North

Pacific, which has an area of 2,800,000 square miles, there is no sounding at all.

Nevertheless, while the approximate mean depth I am mentioning may be con-
siderably altered as knowledge increases, we know enough to say that the Pacific is

generally deeper than the other oceans. The immensity, both in bulk and area, of
this great mass of water, is difficult to realise ; but it may assist us when we realise

that the whole of the land on the globe above water level, if shovelled into the

Pacific, would only fill one-seventh of it.

The Indian Ocean, with an area of 25,000,000 square miles, has a mean depth,

according to Mr. Murray, of a little over 2,000 fathoms. This also is estimated

from a very insuflicient number of soundings.

     The Atlantic, by far the best sounded ocean, has an area of 31,000,000 square
miles, with a mean depth of about 2,200 fathoms.

The temperature of this huge mass of water is an interesting point.

The temperature of the surface is most important to us, as it is largely on it

that the climates of the difi'erent parts of the world depend. This is comparatively

Weeasy to ascertain.    know so much about it that we are not likely to improve

Weon it for many years.  are quite able to understand why countries in the same

latitude differ so widely in their respective mean temperatures ; why fogs prevail in

certain localities more than others ; and how it comes about that others are subject

to tempestuous storms.

On the latter point nothing has come out plainer from recent discussion than

the fact that areas where great differences of surface temperature of the sea

prevail are those in which storms are generated.

    It is a matter of observation that in the region south of Nova Scotia and New-
foundland many of the storms which travel over the Atlantic to this country have

their rise.

    An examination of surface temperature shows that in this region the variations

are excessive, not only from the juxtaposition of the warm water of the Gulf

Stream and the cold water of the Arctic current flowing southward inside of it,

but in the Gulf Stream itself, which is composed of streaks of warm and colder water,

between which differences of as much as 20° Fahr. exist.

The same conditions exist south of the Cape of Good Hope, another well-known

birthplace of storms. Here the Agulhas current of about 70° Fahr. diverted bv

the land pours into the mass of water to the southward, colder by some 25°, and
the meeting-place is well known as most tempestuous.

South-east of the Rio de la Plata is another stormy area, and here we find the

same abnormal variations in surface temperature.

Yet another is found off" the north-east coast of Japan with the same conditions.

These differences are brought about by the mingling of water carried either by

the flowing of a powerful current turned by the land into a mass of water of

different temperature, as is the case off" the Cape of Good Hope, or by the

uprising of lower strata of cooler water through a shallow surface stream, as

appears to be the case in the Gulf Stream.

   A remarkable point recently brought to light by the researches of Mr. John

Murray in Scotch lochs is the effect of wind on the surface temperature. It has

been observed that wind driving oflf a shore drifts the surface water before it.

This water is replaced by the readiest means, that is to say, by water from below

the surface rising to take its place. As the lower strata are in all cases cooler

than the surface, a lowering of the temperature results, and we find, in fact, that
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.      705

near all sea-sbores off which a steady wind hlows the water is cooler than further

to seaward.

    This has an important bearing on coral growth, and explains why on all
western coasts of the great continents off which the trade winds blow we find an
almost absolute dearth of coral, while on the eastern coasts, on which warm currents

impinge, reefs abound, the coral animal flourishing only in water above a certain
temperature.

     Observations of the temperature of the strata of water between the surface and
bottom have been of late years obtained in many parts. Compared with the area

of the oceans they are but few, but our knowledge steadily increases every year.
     The subject of the vertical distribution of temperature has not yet been

thoroughly investigated in the light of the whole of the information which we now

possess, but Dr. Alex. Buchan has been for some time devoting his spare time to
the task, and it is a heavy labour, for the data obtained here and there over the

world by different ships of all maritime nations are very difficult to collect and to
appraise, but I understand that before long we shall have the result, which wiU
prove very interesting, in the last volume of the ' Challenger ' series.

It will readily be understood that observations on temperatures at great depths

require great care. In the first place the thermometers must be most carefully

manufactured. They must be subjected to rigorous tests, and they must be care-

AUfully handled during the operation.  observations are not of the same value,

and the discussion, therefore, presents considerable difficulty and demands much

discretion.

     In the meantime we can state certain known facts.

   We have learnt that the depth of the warm surface water is small.

     In the equatorial current between Africa and South America, where the surface

is of a temperature of 78°, at 100 fathoms it is only 55°, a difference of 23°, and a
temperature of 40° is reached at 400 fathoms. In this region, so far as knowledge

goes, the fall in temperature as we descend is most rapid, but generally spsakin"-

the same variations prevail everywhere.

     In the tropical Pacific the temperature falls 32° from the surface, where it
stands at 82°, to a depth of 200 fathoms, 40° being reached at from 500 to 600
fathoms below the surface.

     Below the general depth of from 400 to 600 fathoms, the temperature decreases

very slowly, but there is considerable variation in the absolute amount of it when
we get to great depths in diflerent parts of the ocean.

     One of the most interesting facts that has been recognised Is that in enclosed

hollows of the ocean the bottom temperature is apparently much less than that

of the stratum of water at a corresponding depth in the waters outside the sub-

marine ridge that forms the enclosing walls, separating them from deeper areas
beyond, and is, in all cases that have been observed, equal to that on the ridge.
From this fact we are enabled to supplement our imperfect knowledge of depths,
because if in a certain part of an ocean we find that the temperature at great

depths is higher than we know exists at similar depths in waters apparently con-
nected, we can feel certain that there is a submarine ridge which cuts off the

bottom waters from moving along, and that the depth on this ridge is that at

which ia found the corresponding temperature in the outer waters. As a corollary
we also assume that the movement of water at great depths is confined to an
almost imperceptible movement, for if there was a motion that we could term, in

the ordinary acceptation of the word, a current, it would infallibly surmount a
ridge and pour over the other side, carrying its lower temperature with it.

   A notable instance is the bottom temperature of the North Atlantic. This is

nowhere below 35° F., although the depths are very great. But in the South
Atlantic at a depth of only 2,800 fathoms the bottom temperature is but a little
above 32° F., and we are therefore convinced that somewhere between Africa
and South America, though soundings do not yet show it, there must be a ridge
&t a depth of about 2,000 fathoms.

     "We also come to the same conclusion with regard to the eastern and western
portions of the South Atlantic, where similar differences prevail.

706 REPORT-- 1894.

     Again, tlie few temperatures that have been ohtained in the eastern South

Pacific show a considerable difference from those in the South Atlantic, and we

are compelled to assume a ridge from the Falkland Islands to the Antarctic

continent.

It is interesting that the investigation into the translation of the great seismic

wave caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 led to a similar and entirely

independent conclusion. The wave caused by the explosion in the Straits of Sunda

reached Cape Horn, where by good chance a French meteorological expedition had

erected an automatic tide gauge, but instead of one series of waves being marked

Aon the paper there were two.      little consideration showed that the South Pole

having directly interposed between Sunda Straits and Cape Horn, the waves

diverted by the land about the pole would arrive from both sides.

One wave, however, made its appearance seven hours before the other.

Study showed that the earliest wave comcidsd in time with a wave travelling

on the Pacific side of the pole, with a velocity due to the known depth, while the

later wave must have been retarded in its journey via the South Atlantic. The

only possible explanation is that the wave had been impeded by comparatively

shallow water.

     The evidence from bottom temperature was then unknown, and thus does one

branch of investigation aid another.
     In the Western Pacific the water is colder, a few bottom temperatures of a

little over 33° F. having been found in the deep trough east of the Tonga Islands;

--but the North Pacific, though the deeper ocean of enormous area and volume

is apparently again cut off by a submarine ridge. The north-western part of the

Indian Ocean is for similar reasons assumed to be divided from the main body, the

shallower water probably running from the Seychelles to the Maldive Islands.

    Mr. Buchanan has pointed out why some parts of oceans, deep and vast though
they be, are when cut off from communication with others warmer at the bottom.

    Water can only sink through lower layers when it is the heavier, and though

a warm surface cun-ent becomes from evaporation denser, its heat makes it specifi-

cally lighter than the strata below.

    It is only when such a current parts gradually with its heat, as in travelling
from tropical to temperate regions, that it sinks and slowly but surely carries

its temperature with it, modifying the extreme natural cold of the bottom layers.

    In the North Atlantic and Pacific we have such a condition. The great

currents of the Gulf Stream and Japan current as they flow to the north sink, and
in the course of ages have succeeded in raising the bottom temperature three or

four degrees.

     In the Southern Seas this influence is not at work, and, directly connected with
the more open water round the South Pole, there is nothingto carry to the abysmal
deptbs any heat to raise them from their normal low temperatures, due to the

absence of any heating influence.
     The ice masses round the South Pole have probably little or no effect on bottom

temperature, as the fresher, though colder, water will not sink ; and, as a matter
of fact, warmer water is found at a few hundred fathoms than at the surface.

     The lowest temperature ever obtained was by Sir John Ross in the Arctic
Ocean in Davis Straits at a depth of 680 fathoms, when he recorded a reading of
25° F. This probably requires confirmation, as thermometers of those days were

somewhat imperfect.

     In the great oceans the greatest cold is found on the western side of the South
Atlantic, where the thermometer stands at 32°-3 F., but temperatures of 29° F. have

been obtained of recent years east of the Fseroe Islands, north of the ridge which

cuts off the deeper waters of the Arctic from the Atlantic.

    Though scarcely within the limits of my subject, which is the sea itself, I must

say a few words on the sea floor.

The researches carried on in the ' Challenger ' revealed that while for a certain

distance from the continents the bottom is composed of terrestrial detritus, every-
where in deep water it is mainly composed of the skeletons or remains of skeletons

of the minute animals that have lived in the water.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  707

    Tn comparatively small depths we find remains of many sLells, As the depth
increases to 500 fathoms or so we get mainly the calcareous shells of the globi-
gerinae which may be said to form by far the greater part of the oceanic floor.

     In deeper water still, where pressure, combined with the action of the carbonic

acid, has dissolved all calcareous matter, we find an impalpable mud with skeletons

of the silicious radiolaria of countless forms of the greatest beauty and complexity.

-- --Deeper still, i.e., in water of speaking generally over 3,000 fathoms, we find a

reddish-coloured clayey mud, in which the only traces of recognisable organic
remains are teeth of sharks and cetacea, many belonging to extinct species.

    What the depths of these deposits may be is a subject of speculation. It may
be that some day, as mechanical appliances are improved, we shall find means of

boring, but up to the present no such operation has been attempted.

    On the specific gravity of the water of the sea I can say but little except that

it varies considerably.

    It is not yet known for certainty how far the specific gravities observed at

various points and depths remain appreciably constant.

     In localities where evaporation is great, and other influences do not interfere,

--it is evident that the specific gravity of the surface will be high a consideration

which observations confirm ; but there are many complications which require more

observation before they can be resolved.

     In some few places repeated observations permit deductions, but taking the sea

as a whole we are yet very ignorant of the facta bearing on this point.
    The waves which for ever disturb the surface of the sea demand much

study.

    The greatest of these, and the most regular, is the tidal wave. On this many
powerful intellects have been brought to bear, but it still presents many unsolved

anomalies.

     Lord Kelvin and Professor Darwin have demonstrated that the tidal movement
is made up of many waves depending upon difl'erent functions of the moon and
sun, some being semi-diurnal, some diurnal. The time of transit over the meridian,

the declination of both bodies, create great variations ; the changing distance and

position of the moon and the position of her node, also have great effect, while the

ever-varying direction and foi'ce of the winds, and the difl'erent pressure of the
atmosphere play their part, and sometimes a very large part, on what is somewhat
loosely known as the meteorological tide.

     The amplitude of the oscillation of the water depending upon each of the

astronomical functions varying for every point on the earth, the effect is that, each

having a different period, the resulting mean movement of the water has most

astonishing variations.

     In some places there is but one apparent tide in the day ; in others this pheno-
menon only occurs at particular periods of each lunation, while in fhe majority of

cases it is the movements of each alternate tide only that appear to have much to

do with one another.

     Though after long observation made of the times and ranges of tides at any
one spot they can now be predicted with great accuracy, for that particular place,
by the method of harmonic analysis perfected by Professor G. Darwin, the meteoro-
logical tide excepted, no one can yet say what the tide will be at any spot where
observations have not been made

    Observations all over the world have now shown that there is no part where
the tidal movement is so regular and simple as around the British Islands. This is

-- --more remarkable when it is found that the tides on the other side of the Atlantic
   at Nova Scotia, for instance are very complicated.
     The minor tides, which in most parts of the world, when combined in one
direction, amount to a veiy considerable fraction of the principal lunar and solar
tides, and consequently greatly increase or diminish their effects, are in Great

Britain so insignificant that their influence is trifling ; but why this should be I

have never yet found anyone to explain.

    Nevertheless there are many very curious points about our tides which are
plainly caused by interference, or, in other words, by the meeting of two tidal

                                                                                                                                     zz2

waves arriving' from opposite directions, or from tlie rebound of the tidal veavcs

from otlier coasts.
      Tliis effect, also, it Las been so far found impossible to predict without observa-

tion. On our southern coasts, for instance ; in the western part the tide rises about

15 feet, but as it travels eastward the range becomes less and less until, about

Poole, it reaches a minimum of 6 feet. Fartlier east again it increases to Hastings,
-where the range is 24 feet. Yet farther east it again gradually diminishes. This
is due to the reflection from the French coast, which brings another wave which
either superposes itself upon, or reduces the effect of, the main tide advancing up

the English Channel; but the details of such reflection are so complex that no

one could forecast them without more knowledge than we possess.

     There can be little doubt that to tbis cause, reflection, is mainly due ths

variations in the amount of mean range of tide which are iound on many coasts
at different parts ; and as these reflected waves may arrive from great distances,
and be many in number, we may cease to wonder at the extraordinary differences

in range of tide which prevail, though it will be understood that this is wholly
separate from the varying heights of each successive tide, or of the tide at
different parts of each lunation, or at different times of the year, which depend

upon the astronomical influences.
     The actual height of the tide in deep water is small, but on passing into shallow

water when approaching a shore, and especially when rolling up a gulf of more or
less funnel shape, it becomes increased by the retardation caused by friction, and
by compression laterally, and hence the height of the tide on a coast aft'ected by

other causes is greater than in the open sea.

     The oceanic tide wave is supposed to be from 2 to 3 feet in height, hut as this
has been assumed from observations made at small oceanic islands where, although
the magnifying influences mentioned are at a minimum, they still exist, we wait
for precise information until some means of actually measuring the tide in deep

water is devised.
     The waves due to wind, though not so far-reaching in their effects as the

majestic march of the tide wave, are phenomena which are more apparent to the

traveller on the ocean.

     The deep sea in a heavy gale presents, perhaps, the most impressive manifesta-

tion of the powers of Nature which man can behold, and doubtless many of us
have experienced feelings that may vary from awe and wonder to sheer delight,

.according to the temperament of each individual, at for thy first time finding himself
face to face with this magnificent sight, though I rather fear that discomfort is the

prevailing feeling that many carry away.
     The height to which storm waves may rise has never been very satisfactorily

determined. Apart from the difficidty of the task and the small number of people

who will address themselves to it when they have the chance, it is but rarely that
any individual sees really abnormal waves, even though he may be at sea all his

life.

     Different heights for what are called maximum waves have been recorded, and

they vary from 40 to 90 feet from crest to hollow.
     All we can sa}' is that the most probable figure is about 50 or 60 feet.
      These great storm waves travel very far. In some cases they convey a warning,

as their velocity always far exceeds that at which the storm is travelling. In others

--they intimate that a gale of which no more is seen has occurred somewhere it may

,be many miles distant.

    When they have travelled beyond the limits of the wind which raised them,

they lose the steepness of slope which characterises them when under its influence,
,and become an undulation which is scarcely noticed when in deep water.

     On approaching shallow water, however, they are again apparent, and the

' rollers ' that occur unperiodically at various places in latitudes where gales never
occur would seem to be caused by such waves, originating in areas many thousands
of miles distant. Such appears to be the origin of the well-known rollers at
Ascension and St. Helena, where the rocky and exposed nature of the landing has
caused this phenomenon to be especially noticed.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  709

      Other Tollers are, however, undoubtedly due to earthquakes or volcanic erup-

 tions occurring in the bed of the sea.

     Many of the great and sudden waves which have caused devastation and great

loss of life on the shores of western South America are referable to this cause.
      Observations to enable the focus of sucb a disturbance to be traced have

generally been lacking, but it is probable that where the wave has been large the

point of origin has not been far distant.

     In one notable instance the conditions were reversed. The point of origin was
known, and the distance to which the resulting wave travelled could be fairly

satisfactorily traced.

     This was the great eruption in the Straits of Sunda, in August 1883, which
locally resulted in the disappearance of the major part of the island of Krakatoa,
and the loss of nearly 40,000 lives, on the neighbouring shores of Java and Sumatra,
by tlie huge wave which devastated them.

     The records of automatic tide gauges and the observations of individuals
enabled the waves emanating from this disturbance to be followed to great dis-

tances. These waves were of great length, the crests arriving at intervals of about
an hour, and moving with a velocity of about 350 miles an hour, were about that

distance apart.

     The waves recorded at Cape Horn were apparently undoubtedly due to the
eruption, and travelled distances of 7,500 miles and 7,800 miles in their course on

either side of the south polar land.

     They were only 5 inches in height above mean level of the sea, while the waves

recorded at places on the southern part of Africa, at a distance of about 5,000
miles from the scene of the eruption, were from 1 to 2 feet high, the original long

waves being of an unknown height, but probably did not exceed 10 or 15 feet.

    No other such opportunity of testing the distances to which great waves may

travel has ever occurred, and as such a catastrophe as gave rise to them could

scarcely be repeated without similar loss of life, it may be hoped we shall not live

to see another, interesting though the discussion of the numerous phenomena were.
     The movement of the particles of water due to the tide wave extends to the

bottom of the deepest water, and doubtless plays an important part in keeping up
a constant motion in the abysses, but the depth to which the action of the surface
waves originating in wind reach is still but little known by observation.

     If, however, we study the contour of the bottom off the shores of land exposed to
the full influence of the great oceans, we are struck by the very general rapid

increase of slope after a depth of about 80 to 100 fathoms (500 to 600 feet) has

been reached.

     It appears probable that this is connected with the depth to which wave
action may extend, the fine particles brought down by rivers or washed from
the land by the attrition of the breakers being distributed and gradually moved
down the slope.

    When we examine banks in the open sea we find, however, that there are a

great many with a general depth of from 30 to 40 fathoms, and the question
arises whether this may not be the general limit of the power of oceanic waves to
cut down the mass acted upon when it is fairly friable.

     The question has an interesting bearing on the subject of the ever-debated
origin of coral atolls, for this is the general depth of many large lagoons ; and
granted that the sea can cut down land to this depth, we have at once an

approach to the solution of the problem of the formation of bases of a suitable
depth and material upon which the coral animal can commence operations.

     This question also awaits more light, and I merely offer this remark as a

suggestion.

     It is, however, somewhat remarkable that in recent cases of volcanic islands piled
up by submarine eruptions, they have all been more or less rapidly washed away,
and are in process of further diminution under the surface.

    Observations on the mean level of the sea show that it constantly varies, in
some places more than others.

     This subject has not yet been worked out.
     !

710     --REPORT 1894.

     In some localities it is plainly due to wind, as in the Red Sea, where the
eaminer level is some two feet below that of winter, owing to the fact that in
summer the wind blows down the whole length of the sea, and drives the

water out.

     In many places, as in the great estuary of the Rio de la Plata, the level is

constantly varying with the direction of the winds, and the fluctuation due to this

cause is greatly in excess of the tidal action.

      In others the cause is not so clear.

    At Sydney, New South Wales, Mr. Russell found that during eleven years the

level was constantly falling at alDout an inch a year, but by the last accounts
received it was again stationary.

     The variations in the pressure of the atmosphere play an important part in

changes of sea level.

   A difference of one inch in the barometer has been shown to be followed by a

difference of a foot in the mean level of the sea, and in parts of the world where
the mean heis^ht of the barometer varies much with the seasons, and the tidal

range is small, this effect is very marked.
     Of any secular change in the level of the sea little is known. This can only

--be measured by comparison with the land, and it is a question which is the more

unstable, the land or the water -probably the land, as it has been shown that
the mass of the land is so trifling, compared with that of the ocean, that it would
take a great deal to alter the general mean level of the latter.

     All the points connected with the sea that I have had the honour of bringing
before you form part of the daily observation of the marine surveyor when he has
the chance ; but I cannot refrain from also mentioning other duties, which ave
indeed in the present state of our knowledge and of the practical requirements

of navigation the principal points to which he has to pay attention, as it may
explain why our knowledge on so many interesting details still remains very

imperfect.

    Working as we do in the interests of the vast marine of Great Britain, the

paramount necessity of good navigational charts requires that the production of

such charts should be our principal aim.

     It is difficult for a landsman and difficult even for a sailor who has never
done such work to realise the time that is necessary to make a really complete
marine survej% The most important part, the ascertainment of the depth,

--is done, so to speak, in the dark that is to say, it is by touch and not \>y

sight that we have to find the different elevations and depressions of the bottom

of the sea.

     In making a map of the land an isolated rock or hill stands up like a beacon

above the surrounding land, and is at once localised and marked, but a similar
object under the sea can only be found by patient and long-continued sounding,

and may very easily be missed.

    When it is considered that marine surveying has only been seriously under-

taken for about 100 years, with a very limited number of vessels, we shall, I
think, understand how in the vast area of the waters, taking only those bordering
the shores, many unsuspected dangers are yearly discovered.

      Very, very few coasts have been minutely surveyed, and, setting aside for a
moment the great changes that take place off shores where sandbanks prevail,

I should be sorry to say that even on our own coasts charts are perfect.
     Yearly around Great Britain previously unknown rocks come to light, and if

this is the case at home, what are we to think of the condition of charts of less
known localities

     Our main efforts, therefore, are directed to the improvement of charts for safe

navigation, and the time that can be spared to the elucidation of purely scientific

problems is limited.

      Nevertheless, the daily work of the surveyor is so intimately connected with
these scientific problems that year by year, slowly but surely, we add to the accu-
mulation of our knowledge of the sea.

  1. On Current Polar Exjiloration. By Col. H. W. Feilden.^

2. On a Recent Journey in the Valley of the Euphrates.
                      By D. G. Hogarth.

This journey was undertaken for archaeological reasons in order to see whether

remains of Roman frontier works exist on the right bank of the Euphrates in a state

of preservation similar to that of Severus's road to Melitene, explored by Messrs.

Hogarth and Munro in 1891. Mr. Hogarth's party consisted of Messrs. V. W.
Yorke and F. W. Green and Lord Encombe.

' The great river Euphrates ' was seen first at Khalfat. Here and for 300 miles

up it can be crossed only by ferry boats of singularly rude construction ; and the

process of crossing with horses in such craft is exciting. The upper course of the

river is rarely navigated and only by skin-rafts and swimmers on skins partly filled

with grain. The depth and precipitousness of its gorge cause the Euphrates to be

a serious barrier, and no road can long follow either bank. From Khalfat to

Samsat the party had to cut off a bend, passing through villages of settled Kurds,

tamed by the possession of agricultural wealth, and imbued through contact with

Arabs and Syrians with orthodox Islam, Above Samsat the gorge soon becomes

impassable, and dangerous rapids begin. The party made straight across Taurus,

meeting great difficulties from narrow paths on precipices and soft snow. Descend-

ing near Malatia they made their way past the junction of the northern and eastern

forks, about whose names and respective claim to be the main stream there seems

much error in maps. The natives call the northern fork Murad, not Kara Su, and

consider it the main river. The name Frat is known, but little used. North of the

j unction, where the Kurdish mountains hang over the left bank, the scenery is
very grand indeed. The party continued to follow the river up to Erzingan.

The Kurds here are heretical and wilder than in the south. The Armenians

are less servile than ordinary, but, being alive to the religious, social, and geo-

graphical difficulties in the way of independence, would gladly be left alone by

agitators. There is little evidence of wanton oppression, least for religion's sake.

Less is heard in the country than out of it of Kurdish tyranny. Armenians are well

off in many respects, better in some than poor Moslems. Their condition is not

improved, but the reverse, by ii-responsible and otiose expressions of sympathy in

Europe. Geographical considerations go far to preclude Armenia from becoming

again a nation. Legionary camps were found at Samosata and Satala, but none at

AMelitene.  magnificent Roman bridge exists near Kiakhta and ruins of others,

but no milestones or roadway connecting frontier forts, two of which were dis-

covered. The reported walls along the bank south of Taurus were found to consist

of ruins of an aqueduct. The river itself formed the most impassable of frontiers

it might well have seemed that the angel's vial must be poured out on the great

river Euphrates, and the waters thereof dried up ere the way of the kings of the

East could be prepared.

     Montenegro, since the Berlin treaty, has nearly doubled in area. The old
Montenegro, which lies near the sea, is made up of bare limestone mountains en-

closing fertile basins, the average height of the country above the sea being 2,000
to 3,000 feet. The Zeta, flowing into the Lake of Scutari, is the chief river, but
this part of the country is almost destitute of water, and the inhabitants are com-

pelled to store snow for drinking. The small village of Cetiuje, which forms the

brated there the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the earliest Slavonic
printing press, ?et up not far from Cetinje in 1493.

    In the new Montenegro to the north and vrest the geographical characteristics

are quite distinct. Grassy downs, dense forests, and innumerable mountain streams
are found, and there is excellent pasture for sheep. The two highest mountains

are Kom and Durmitor, which are slightly under 9,000 feet high.

     The Montenegrins are divided into clans and communes, and possess an elabo-
rate system of local government. At present Montenegro is emerging from an
Homeric state of society, and its future depends on the ability of its people to

adapt themselves to less warlike pursuits.

           1. On the Bathymetrical Survey of the French Lakes.
                               By E. Delebecque.

As the result of the author's soundings in most of the French lakes, he has

produced a series of sheets, published in 1892 and 1893 by the Ministere des

Travaux Publics, under the title ' Atlas des Lacs Fran^ais.' The soundings were

in erery case made by means of a steel wire mounted on a graduated drum, the

revolutions of which indicated the amount of wire payed out. The form of appa-

ratus at first used was that of the Swiss Bureau Topographique, subsequently that

of Belloc was employed, but finally one designed by the author and only weighing

4 kilogrammes was adopted. The position of each sounding was determined, either

from angular measurements of the graduated mast of the boat taken from the

Ashore, or by sextant bearings of objects on shore taken from the boat.  number

of lakes have been sounded more roughly than those laid down in the atlas, and

many observations of temperature and of the chemical composition of the water

have been made.

Ihe atlas, which will be completed by the addition of maps of several lakes

i a the Jura and the Pyrenees, is only a part of a comprehensive work about to he

published by the author. The lakes already mapped in the atlas are arranged as

follows :

PI. 1. Lake of Geneva (the Swiss part sounded by M. Hornliman, of the

Bureau Topographique FiJderal) on the scale y^j^nTj-
     PI. 2. Lake of Bourget, scale ^s^xj^-

     PI. 10. Lakes of lasarl^s (Ardeche), Bouchet (Haute-Loire), Pavin, Chauvet,

Godivelle, and Tazanat (Puy-de-D6me), scale xhStjit-
     In all cases the configuration of the lakes is expressed by contour lines at

intervals of 5 or 10 metres, and the position of each sounding is shown by a dot.
It was impossible to add the land contours on the same scale, as the French stafl-
maps do not show them with sufficient exactness.

                   By Hugh Egbert Mill, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

the following tabular statement to be drawn up :

the Norwegian Sea lyiug at the bottom of the Faeroe-Shetland Channel, and loses
its horizontal motion. The warmer the Atlantic current, the more rapidly does
this mixture take place. Hence in a hot, windless summer a mass of Atlantic
water, extending to a great depth, tends to collect on the northern and north-
western edge of the North Sea bank.

     2. At all seasons Atlantic water is drawn from the Faeroe-Shetland Channel
and forced into the North Sea by the tides between Orkney and Shetland. The
tidal streams run N. W. and S.E., and an eddy is formed to the north-west of the
Orkneys, into which North Sea water is drawn, and perhaps also water from

below.

     3. As the season advances the surface water of the North Sea becomes warmer,
the upper layers probably receive smaller supplies of fresh water, but they become
specifically lighter than the under layers, which they protect from the warming
influences of tlie atmosphere. The upper layers becoming idtimately warmer

than the Atlantic current, the surface of the North Sea becomes higher, and the
surface water spreads outwards into the Faeroe-Shetland Channel, checking the
surface supply of Atlantic water.

      Meanwhile, the mass of Atlantic water, collecting at the edge of the North Sea
Bank, seeks entrance into the North Sea. Mixing with the cold bottom water
already there, it increases its salinity, but reduces its specific gravity by warming
it, and, at a certain stage of mixture, the temperatures and salinities of the two

waters combine to form a ridge or axis of maximum specific gravity. This axis,
which probably ]-uns N.E. from Shetland in the end of May or in June, turns
slowly toward a N. to S. direction, and moves eastward. As it retreats, Atlantic
water is gradually admitted round the north end of the Shetlands, passes down

the east side of the groups, joins the tidal stream at the south end, and, guided by
the axis of heavy water, is distributed along the east coast of Scotland, probably
during July and August. Later in the summer, as the axis retreats still further,
the Atlantic water is probably distributed more towards the eastward, perhaps
imtil the latter part of September, when the diminishing supply from the Faeroe
Channel, and the increasing outflow from the eastern side of the North Sea, bring
about a gradual return to the conditions with which we started.

      Obviously the controlling conditions are complex, but it appears that the greater
the winter cold and the spring supply of ice-cold water from the continent, the
more slowly will Atlantic water penetrate into the North Sea below the surface

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and the wanner the summer, the more will the surface supply be checked. At the
same time, the warmer the summer the larger the quantity of Atlantic water
seeking admission, and the greater its thermal power to drive back the axis of
maximum weio^ht.

            4. On Geographical rhotography. By John Thomson.

     The paper dealt with the difficulties experienced by travellers in the use of
photography as an aid to exploration. The purposes of photography referred to
did not include surveying, but merely the production of pictures showing ethno-
graphic types, characteristic scenery from the geographical rather than the artistic
point of view, and the details of artificial structures.

      The necessity of proper training in the principles as well as the practical
methods of photography was insisted on. Practical hints were given for the pre-
servation and use of dry-plates, and for the successful development of negatives in

tropical countries.

    A series of travellers' photographs illustrating the excellences and the defects

of such work was shown by the lantern.

                  5. A A'ev) Light on the Discovery of America.
                       By H. Yule Oldham, M.A., F.B.G.S.

     The development of America has had such a vital effect on the British Isles
removing them from an obscure situation on the outskirts of the known world to

--their true geographical position as the centre of the land masses of the globe that

everything relating to its discovery is of exceptional interest.

    It is now well known that Columbus's famous voyage in A.u. 1492 opened the
way to the settlement of the New World. It is not so well known that it had

been visited before his time.

   A glance at the map of the Atlantic Ocean will show the three easiest points

of access.

     (1) North America, by means of the convenient stepping-stones, Iceland and

Greenland.
     (2) Central America, with the help of the steady N.E, trade-winds.
     (3) Brazil, in South America, which is not only the nearest point to the Old

World, but has the additional advantage of winds and currents tending in its

direction.

   There can be little doubt that America was visited by Norsemen about a.d. 1000
by the first route. Tradition and the records of some early maps, which show
large land masses as far west of the Azores as they are west of Europe, seem to

indicate that the second route had been possibly utilised early in the fifteenth
century, but the third and easiest was not available till tlie West African coa.st as
far as Cape Verde had been discovered.

     It was in a.d. 1445 that Cape Verde was for the first time rounded by one of
the exploring expeditions despatched from Portugal by the indefatigable Prince

Henry.
      There is good reason to believe that only two years later Brazil was reached.

     At that period great activity prevailed in Portugal ; a large and increasing-
number of ships were yearly despatched along the West African coast. Nothing

is less improbable than that one of these vessels should have been carried out to

sea and driven to the coast of Brazil ; and to show that this actually occurred we

have documentary evidence.
     There is at Milan a remarkable manuscript map, dated a.d. 1448, drawn by

Andrea Bianco, of Venice, one of the best known of the map-makers, who worked
in the first half of the fifteenth century. On this map are shown for the first

time the results of the Portuguese discoveries as far as Cape Verde ; but in addition
there is drawn at the edge of the map, south-west from that cape, in the direction

of Brazil, a long stretch of coast line labelled ' Authentic Island,' with a further

inscription to the effect that it stretches ' 1,500 miles westwards.' Such a name
and inscription are quite exceptional on maps of this kind, and must have been due

to definite information.

     Antonio Galvano in ' The Discoveries of the World,' published in the middle
of the sixteenth century, says that in a.d. 1447 a Portuguese ship was carried by a
great tempest far westwards until an island was discovered, from which gold was
brought back to Portugal,

     As Bianco's map of a.d. 1448 was made in London, it is likely that it represents

information about this voyage derived in Portugal, where Bianco probably called
on a voyage from Venice to England.

     The conclusion to be drawn is that South America was first seen in the very
year in which Columbus is believed to have been born by one of the Portuguese
explorers despatched by Prince Henry the Navigator.

716 REPORT--1894.

     The means and incidents of travel in tlie Mexican ranges described and com-
pared with those of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada.

     The variations of climate in the Sierra Madre, and their effect upon mountain
dwellers and their habits and industries, including certain of the isolated Indian
tribes and the cave-dwellers of Sonora and Chihuahua, are illustrated by author's
experiences in crossing the main range in Sonora, Sinaloa, and Michoacan,

compared with similar experiences in Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, and

California.

     The probable source of origin of Sierra Madre races, viz., North American,
South American, and Asiatic, is discussed and illustrated by description of various

antiquities, including villages, tombs, cave fortifications, and gardens, discovered

or visited by author.

Incidents are given showing the gradual fusion of these races into the existing

Mexican nation of to-day, and the extent to which a few families still remain

unabsorbed                                                as in the case of the Apaches in Sonora, the Cota Indians in Durango,
                                                       ;

and the Zapotecas of the Tehuantepec Istlimus.

     Certain peculiarities in the geological structure, vegetable productions, and
fauna of the Sierra Madre are noted, together with legends and traditions amongst
the primitive inhabitants arising out of known facta connected with them.

     The extent of mountain country in Western Mexico still practically unexplored
is shown by comparison with modern maps, which are entirely vague and im-
perfect in every instance, excepting where the State authorities have made some
attempt at actual survey, owing to the necessity of defining raining claims.

     The watersheds and their discharges are pointed out, with general description

of the great lakes of Chapala, Patzcuaro, and Cuitzeo.

     Also some description of the pine forests above the timber-line, the summits
above snow-line (compared with those of North America), and the present seats
of volcanic activity, and their relation to seismic disturbance along the Pacific

coast.

     The author's view is given as to the structural history of the western coast-
line, and the very slight changes which have probably occurred in it since the

Palaeozoic period.

the Rev. J. Chalmers, the well-known missionary. They reached Port Moresby in

a Queensland Government schooner of sixty-eight tons register on August 15, and

after a short stay continued this journey westward for 160 miles to Motu-motu,

Awhere the native villages were visited.                  canoe voyage was then undertaken to

the inland village of Movi-avi, where the natives were suspicious and dangerous.

After returning to Port Moresby by the same route a visit was paid to Kerepuna,.

and Hood Bay was left for Cooktown in Queensland on September 2.

     The purpose of tbis paper is to show in the first place that the indispensable
preliminary requirement with a view to the end stated is to have an adequate
scheme of ortbof.'raphy, not adequate in the sense of providinjj; a separate sio^n for
all articulate sounds, but through making- up for the deficiency of such signs by
clear rules to be followed with respect to the sounds for which signs are lacking.
To leave it to the individual judgment to decide what is the nearest sound repre-
sented in the scheme to one for which no express provision is made is bound to
lead to confusion. The inadequacy of the latest version of the Royal Geographical
Society's scheme from this point of view is tben pointed out, and suggestions of
remedies are made. It is contended that the recognition of customary spellings
under Rules 2 and 7 of that scheme, reasonable and indeed inevitable as such
recognition is, imperatively demands the drawing up of schedules of such recog-
nised spellings as supplements to the scheme. The addition of some subordinate
rules likely to promote the efficiency with which the scheme is carried out is next
recommended. Attention is drawn to special difficulties in connection with
Russian and Greek names, and reasons are given for entertaining the hope that,
with the aid of Oriental scholars, special rules might usefully be framed with re-
gard to the spelling of Chinese and Indo-Chinese names. Finally, it is urged
that, once an adequate scheme adequately expounded is adopted, it would be of
great importance to make special arrangements to secure the co-operation of all
contributors to the ' Geographical Journal ' and other geographical periodicals, of
publishers and authors, and, above all, of the newspaper Press, towards getting the
scheme carried out.

  [6. On the Geography of Lower Nwbia. By Somers Claeke, F.S.A.

    The paper was chiefly confined to that part of Lower Nubia which will be
flooded by the proposed Nile reservoir. The difierence in size and colour-effect of
the scenery in the valley of the NUe above and below Assuan were noticed. The
Wadi Kenus, the abode of the Beni Kensi tribe, is nearlv coincident with the pro-
iected Nile reservoir, and if the proposed scheme is carried out the population to
be displaced numbers about 30,000, inhabiting a cultivated area of some 10,000
square acres (F). Population in the Ptolemaic times must have been greater, as
there are tracts about Korti and Dakkeh, once under cultivation, now abandoned.
In the Dodeka-Schoenus there are a number of temples and remains of antiquity
within the district thus named, a further proof of considerable population ; and the
district is protected by a line of forts, some of very high antiquity, some of later
date. The existence of Egyptian civilisation side by side with the ruder customs
of the natives is especially to be observed in the method of burial. The present
inhabitants on the course of the Nile valley from Assuan to Wadi Haifa exhibit

Tery slight variations in modes of dress, particularly among the women. Men go
to Cairo, women stop in the villages, so that the men adopt ordinary dress of

fellaheen in Egypt.
     The manner of building houses from lumps of earth, crude brick, with flat

wooden or vaulted brick roofs constructed iu the same way as those used by tlie
ancient Egyptians was noticed. Reed shelters are also in use.

     Not only the unique antiquities but the present people, with all life, animal and
vegetable alike, are afl'ected by the projected reservoir. In view of the contem-
plated destruction it is of the utmost importance to make an exhaustive scientitie
investigation of the valley before it is submerged.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I'.

Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

--President op the Section Professor C. F. Bastable, M.A., F.S.S.

THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

The President delivered the, followiiig Address :

The long period that has elapsed since the British Association last met in

Oxford, covering as it does the life of an entire generation remarkable for activity

in all departments of scientific work, would of itself suggest at least some passing

notice of the changes that have taken place, and the progress realised in the sub-

jects assigned to this section.

     But some special reasons combine to give increased interest to a comparison

between the position of economic science in 1860 and at the present day. What
is usually known as orthodox political economy had taken its final shape and
reached its highest point of practical influence just at the time when Nassau W.

Senior, one of its most typical expositors, was chosen to preside over Section F. at

its first meeting here. Far better even than J. S. Mill, Senior represented the
strong and weak points of the English school. Clearness of thought, a firm grasp

of elementary principles, and complete freedom from the disturbing influence of

sentiment, are distinguishing marks of the compact treatise in which he set forth

the chief doctrines of Economics, and they are equally shown in his presidential

address. Political economy, he maintains, is a science and nothing else, limited in

its scope to the subject of wealth, and concerned rather with mental than with

physical phenomena. This very precision and rigid limitation naturally tended

to produce some of the less admirable characteristics of the normal 'political

economist.' Undue insistence on the omnipotence of purely material motives, a
somewhat cynical disregard of the moral forces that influence human action in

respect to wealth, and a certain love of paradox, especially in cases where popular

prejudice was concerned, may be traced in Senior's writings as in those of most

of his contemporaries, and go far to account for the intense repugnance felt by

moralists and social reformers for a system which confined itself to one, and that

which they deemed the lowest and coarsest side of human life.      ---'-^

     Such as it was, however, with, and in part by reason of, its definiteness and its
narrowness, political economy commanded the respect of a lai-ge section of the
public and of its instructors and guides in the Press, who looked on it as supplying

a rational code of industrial and commercial conduct. ' The recognised principles

of political economy,' or ' the immutable laws of supply and demand,' were phrases

that occurred as readily to a journalist in the sixties as ' the exploded doctrine of
laisser faire ' does to the leader-writer of to-day. The scientific doctrine of the

economist applied to practice became the guiding rule of the practical man of
business. Its influence on legislation is strikingly shown by two important
triumphs gained in this very year (1860). The first and most enduring was the

full and complete establishment of free trade as the basis of the fiscal policy of
the United Kingdom by the budget measures of the year; the second, though
--

--transient, is even more instructive for our present purpose viz., the declaration,

in Cardwell's Irish Land Act, that for the future tenancies should rest ' on
contract and not on tenure,' so that the relation between letters and hirers of land
was reduced to a purely commercial one subject to the law of the market, and

released, so far as legislation could secure that result, from all influence of senti-

ment or custom.
     In such a condition of apparent prosperity, it was hardly likely that any

apprehensions should be felt as to the future of economic study, and accordingly

no signs of misgiving are to be found in Senior's brief but emphatic statements.

His sole complaint is directed against the unfortunate tendency on the part of
contributors of papers to wander from the region of science into that of art or
practice, to the neglect of their proper subject, which afforded a sufficiently ample

field for fruitful inquiries.

     I need not say that this attitude of calm and assured confidence did not long
continue, and it is equally unnecessary to attempt any description of the series of

revolts against both the strict theoretical doctrines and some of the practical con-

clusions of the classical economy. Abundant information as to the leading phases

of the movement and the chief actors therein is supplied in works so well known

that any summary of their contents could be only the merest commonplace.' As

affording a starting-point for further discussion I may, however, remark that

three causes have most effectively operated in bringing about the changed position

--of our science viz. (1) The influence of foreign, and chiefly German, workors in

the same field                                                         (2)  the  profound  though  peaceful  political  revolution  by which
                                                                    ;

power has been transferred to the working classes ; and (3) the growth of the

doctrine of evolution, which has been perhaps more potent in its effects on the

social than even on the biological sciences.

   --As regards the first point, there is no room for doubt or question. With the

exception of Say and Bastiat who were chiefly valued as popularisers of English

--opinions no foreign economist was at all known in England before the last thirty

years. The mere suggestion that we had anything to learn from Germany,

Holland, or Italy would have appeared ludicrous to Senior or McCulloch, or,

indeed, to the educated public.^ The true position of the foreigner was that of the

bumble disciple accepting gladly orthodox English teaching. This insularity of

tone undoubtedly retarded progress in all departments of economics, but its evil
effect was greatest in preventing any thorough consideration of the social and
political groundwork on which all systems of economy rest, and to which all
economic theories must, if they are to be enduring, pay adequate attention. The

'great and saving merit of German economic investigation lies in its unreserved

acceptance of this fundamental fact, and it was in this very point that our English

Wepredecessors most signally failed.                                                       should have escaped much narrowness and

onesidedne.ss of view if our writers had sought to understand and appreciate the

-Continental conception of the political sciences as an oriranLsed group of studies.

Nor is it quite clear that this just ground of complaint has been altogether

removed. Admirable efforts have been made by Leslie and others to diffuse a

general knowledge of the labours of the historical school, ard our principal text-

books no longer pass over in silence the weighty contributions of foreign writers to

special points of doctrine. Among professed students and teachers of economics

there is a considerable and growing acquaintance with the products of foreign

thought. Yet it seems as if the best lesson that they convt^y has not been

thoroughly laid to heart, and that most of our attention has benn directed to one

particular school which makes the nearest approach to English methods, and is

therefore least likely to help in correcting our peculiar failings. Is it not some-

Koscher, whose loss every student of economic and political scence must deplore,

hive found no English translator or even effective imitator?^ Other instances

ne irly as glaring might be mentioned, leading to the general result that the

distinctive differences of the English mode of treating economics are not sufficiently

recognised, and further progress is for the time hindered.

Increased political power obtained by the class of manual workers has most

markedly altered the prevalent tone of thought on industrial questions, and, if it

has not caused, has at all events coincided with the adoption of more tolerant

views respecting the effect of labour combinations. Fuller analysis has shown that

the consequences of economic action are far more complex and more affected by

surrounding conditions than upholders of the orthodox doctrines were willing to

admit ; but this modification in theory has been guided by the urgent pressure

of non-expert opinion. It needed a very hard struggle to secure due recognition

of the elements of truth in the trade-union position as to the determination of

wages. But the mere substitution of ' working class ' for * middle class ' dogma

would not indicate any scientific advance. It is rather in the evidence of the close

connection of economic facts with other forms of social activity that the true

importance of the change consists. It is henceforth clear that no interpretation of

industrial or other economic phenomena can claim to be adequate unless it takes

into account the particular forms of social structure and the special political

conditions which have helped to produce them.

More profound and far-reaching, both in its actual effects and in its still greater

promise for the future, was the appearance of the principle of evolution, that

became an active force from 1859. Its immediate influence in one branch of social

study is well shown in the reception given to Maine's ' Ancient Law ; ' and though

the economists did not at once recognise the full import of the method in respect to

their own department of work, they saw its value in some special points, and

thereby gave an opening for its further and more extensive employment." The

most obvious of the services that the new conception rendered was in bringing out

the general similarity of the various sciences dealing with man, which again made

examination of the bonds joining economics to the related subjects a more

prominent object. Just as in biology the older inelastic views as to the nature of

species and types gave way before the idea of innumerable gradations and

transitional forms, so rigidity of definition and isolation of the study of wealth

became no longer possible. Economic problems were found to be in contact at

many points with social and political ones, and even within the artificially limited

field of economics maintenance of the sharp lines between 'capital' and 'non-

capital,' between ' rent' and ' interest,' between ' currency ' and ' credit,' presented

difficulties in face of the complexities of real life.^

Thus the disposition to take a broader view of the subject, and to widen the

general conceptions and the 'setting' in which the received economic doctrines

were presented, was encouraged by a series of influences operating in the same

direction, and which, taken together, have left no inconsiderable mark on the

actual condition of the science. The severest critic of the current political

economy cannot, without unfairness, refuse to admit the improvement in tone, the

greater thoroughness in the investigation of economic problems, and the wider

range undertaken by the latest work of the English school. Much that was

misleading or positively erroneous has been removed, and many valuable additions

have been made to that part of the older system which has successfully stood the

test of hostile examination. There is, besides, ample opportunity afforded for

carrying on the work of reconstruction                                                                                                                                              indeed, it is chiefly because any suggestions,

and amended economic doctrine, as it appears to-day, seems to require further
expansion and readjustment.

     In tlie first place I cannot feel that there is any adequate expression of the
ultimate dependence of economics on that larger subject of study which treats of
society as a whole. It is no doubt true that our leading economists state very
distinctly the great importance of a science of society could it only be brought into
a healthful existence ; but such general confessions lose most of their value when
accompanied by a very pronounced scepticism as to the establishment in the present
or near future of any sec of doctrines worthj^ of the nime of sociology.^ The very

danger of this attitude lies in the fact that in one way it is so undeniably correct.
When some of the more vehement assailants of the old political economy sought
to contrast it to its disadvantage with a supposed social science into which it was
to be absorbed, it was very natural to reply that political economy, however defec-
tive, was a fact, while sociology ' was best described as an aspiration.' There was

no difficulty in showing that the so-called systems of sociology consisted of imper-

-- --fectly collated facts and daring often most unlucky guesses as to the course of

future events. The strict economist stood on very safe ground in contending
against the dogmatism of the ' Positive Folity.' But though the best attempts at a
systematic treatment of social science have hitherto been grossly defective, this
affords no excuse for neglecting a statement and analysis of the fundamental con-
ceptions appropriate to social study and presupposed in all more special inquiries.

      Political economy, like jurisprudence or political science proper, requires as its

--basis a fairly accurate comprehension of these preliminary parts of sociology. The

questions ' What is a society ? ' ' What are the conditions necessary for its ex-

--istence ? ' * In what manner the chief social structures are produced ? ' and many

others of the same class should, I believe, be discussed as an introduction to the
narrower economic problems. Moreover, some topics that seem purely economic
have really a far wider significance. ' Division of labour,' ' Supply and demand,'

and ' The population question,' must be regarded in a broader way than is possible

within the limits that logical symmetry prescribes to the economist. In fact, the
greater part of the matter to be found in the division of our text-books devoted to
the subject of ' Production' is only Introduced to supply the want of a due preparatory
study of the leading features of what I may lor the moment call the ' social
organism.' That expression has unfortunately some unsatisfactory implications.

It seems to give support to the idea that the social and political sciences may be

regarded as mere appendices to biology, and that by a liberal adoption of the

technical terms of that science we can turn out a complete and definite system

without the trouble of continued effort applied directly to the study of social phe-

nomena. This belief seems to me to be hopelessly mistaken, and I would protest

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              '*

as strongly as anyone against the ' manipulation of biological ideas and phrases '
as a mode of dealing with either economic or social questions. But the general
conceptions which are needed to realise the broad features of social structure are
not the peculiar property of any single science. Division of labour, e.g., was
recognised as a social truth long before its Importance for the vital sciences was
appreciated. It is therefore quite possible, without any illegitimate borrowing or
routine Imitation of Inappropriate methods of exposition, to provide a satisfactory
groundwork of social doctrine on which our economic theories can be securely
based. Such a change in the usual method of treatment would be in harmony with
the development of economics during the last twenty years, and could be attained
without any sacrifice of the valuable material stored up in the standard treatises.
Nor Is it merely at the outset that systematic reference to social structures and
conditions is required ; all through the course of investigation that the economist
has to pursue he will find that fresh light is thrown on even the minutest details
by continvually keeping in mind and striving as far as possible to realise the com-
plete life of the society which exhibits them as one part of its varied activities.

Cireat advances liave already been made in this direction. No cue can fail to

perceive the contrast between the bareness of the manuals of Senior and Fawcett

-- --and except in some particulars ' of J. S. Mill's ' Principles ' as compared with the

more elaborate presentation of our best modern text-books, liefined analysis of

economic motives and critical discussion of abstract theoretical conceptions still
hold a very large place ; but the accurate exhibition of the growth of population

and of the forms of industrial organisation, the tracing in their natural order of
development of the ' village community,' the ' feudal system,' and of commercial

land tenure,- do much more to promote the effective progress of scientific economics

than the most brilliant efforts at deduction from unduly simplified premises. I

would specially insist on the fact that it is the social basis rather than the slighter
edifice of half-developed theory that gives life and power to our present work.

^\'e are thus led to the conclusion that one important step in the further progress

of economics must be the fuller recognition of its dependence at the outset on, and

its close relation all through its inquiries with, general social science, but that this

--reform does not need any extreme change in attitude it rather involves the logical

carrying out of an already pronounced tendency. No department or section of

economics can escape this revision. Questions of value, money, credit, and foreign

--trade to take topics that are supposed to be particularly amenable to abstract
--treatment are more affected by social conditions than the theoretic economist will

formally admit. Only through study of these influences can the materials needed

for a correct theoretical solution be obtained, and due weight given to the several

elements involved.

     Another reform will be the natural, or rather necessary, consequence of that

already urged. As soon as we get thoroughly accustomed to contemplating

economic conditions in their actual forms as the special products of social life, it is

but a matter of course to notice the remarkable differences and equally remarkable

resemblances that different instances of the same economic institution or function

-- --will present. The banking system to take a familiar example is not the same in

England as in France, while in the United States a third variety, or set of varieties,

is to be found. Even within the same country there is no absolute uniformity.

London banking differs from country banking, and Scotch banking, again, is distinct
Afrom either. Differences in environment will supply a partial explanation.
                                                                             new

suited to an old centre of industry and commerce. But peculiarities of social structure

Weand even historical accidents count for much.  must go to history to find the origin

of the Bank of England and the system of which it is the foundation, a,nd to some

peculiarities of the American Constitution for an explanation of the failure of the
two attempts to permanently establish a similar institution in that country.* Now,

what is true of banking is equally true of the monetary organisation, the economic

--features of the transport system in a word, of every part of the economy of a

nation or people. The attempts of diflPerent schools of economists to deal with this

problem of variations must, I think, strike the unprejudiced observer as at best in-
adequate. Senior and McCulloch, representing very fairly the average economic

opinion of their day, admitted the existence of diversities, but escaped their con-

.sideration by placing them outside the ring fence that bounded pure economics, or

by regarding them as certain to disappear with the diffusion of sound views on the

     ' Mill's treatment of the earlier and ruder forms of land tenure is much more
realistic and better ' nourished with specific facts ; ' but this departure, as he deemed
it, from scientific precision was partly due to his strong interest in the Irish land
question, and, as Whewell pointed out, is really an imitation of the method pursued

subject.* They in this way strove to keep up their favourite science as a real and
positive one, while they shut out a number of trouhlesome questions. Mill and

Cairnes holdly maintained that political economy merely dealt with tendencies, and
was a hypothetical rather than a positive science ; by throwing aside all the pecu-
liarities and confining attention to the points of agreement certain formally valid
results could be reached. To directly apply them to practice or regard them
as a complete interpretation of concrete phenomena was simply an error in logic
for which, when committed by others, the economist could not be held account-

able.^

The English members of the historical school either neglect all but the crudest

empirical classification, or suggest that each historical period must be treated by

the use of special hypotheses suited to its particular condition, and thus succeed in

combining their acceptance of a great deal of the traditional economic doctrine with

Si much more realistic treatment in respect to earlier times. All these methods

seem defective, though in very different degrees. If the political economy of the

middle of this century is to be regarded as a positive science, applicable without

restriction of time or place, we get a ready explanation of the charge of ' undue

absoluteness ' so strongly urged by Knies,^ and, it must be allowed, with considerable

justice. There was Irom this point of view but one correct system in respect to

each economic element. Large farms, free bargaining between independent

labourers and employers, the single standard, and a banking system rigidly con-

forming to that prescribed by the Act of 1844, were some of the features of a well-

orcfamsed economic society, any aberrations from which should be rectified at the

first convenient opportunity. So narrow a conception could not long stand the

test of wider experience, and accordingly it made way for the treatment of the
subject as based on a series of hypotheses. By skilfully limiting and qualifying

the leading doctrines it was not ditiicult to avoid the more obvious contradictions,

and explain away persistently obstinate facts by regarding them as ' friction,' or as

' minor disturbing causes ' which might be neglected without disadvantage. Used

with reference to a given time and place, and with a wise selection of premises, the

hypothetical deductive method yielded fruit of considerable value, but it utterly

broke down in the attempt to deal with cases outside those included in the selected

type, and even in dealing with them needed constant supplement and correction.

Though the procedure of the economic historian appears specially devised to meet

this defect, as it dwells on the differences found in the economic factors at different

periods of a nation's history, it is far too narrow and too much complicated by the

mass of details to render the service which is required. Economic history will,

in conjunction with observation of existing conditions, ultimately furnish a rich store

of materials out of which scientific results may be extracted, and this latter and

most important part of the work will need systematic classification of the several

types of institutions and conditions. To return to the example already given, it is

necessary not merely to consider the abstract theory of banking under certain sup-

posed conditions and its history in all countries so far as attainable. The principal

object should be to ascertain the different groups into which banking systems can

be scientifically arranged, and the ways in which each is produced by, and in turi»

reacts on the other parts of, the social system. Writers on sociology speak

somewhat pretentiously of the ' consensus of the social organism,' but they aore

and that France and Italy have a third system in force.' The origin and actual
working of these types of financial administration and their relation to the economic
and commercial institutions of the several countries in which they exist present an
interesting subject of inquiry, and this is but one trifling instance of what is to be
abundantly found in nearly every part of the field of economics. Until such points
are studied in detail and by the comparative method, we cannot expect to obtain a
completed body of economic doctrine resting on careful generalisations gathered from

a sufficiently extensive experience.

     To the same defect is due the weakness in certain respects of our economic
literature so far as monographs are concerned. Attention has often been called

possess no recent works on the great subjects of (1) colonisation and (2) commer-
cial crises that can bear comparison with the French and German studies.'- It

would almost seem that the attention of the younger economists is too much

fastened on the passing aspects of the labour and currency questions to allow time
to be devoted to calmer theoretic investigation. Even from the point of view of

immediate personal advantage this is decidedly a mistake. No better advice could

perhaps be given to the serious economic student at the opening of his work than
to steadily avoid ' burning questions.' They are sure to be eagerly taken up by
popular and untrained writers. Their scientific features are buried beneath a

weight of prejudice and partisan feeling, and, last but not least, they so quickly

become ' burnt out,' and public attention turns away to some other and equally

temporary subject of debate. Careful examination of a really important question

for the moment a little in the background must in the end prove more serviceable
when the force of events compels practical men to direct their attention to it, and
to consult those who have given time and trouble to its elucidation.

   A third point on whicti some reform is needed concerns the organisation and

teaching of the subject more than the advancement of scientific research, though it
would not be without good results for the latter. It is the relation of economics,

not to the outlines of social science that are its necessary basis, but to the other

divisions dealmg with cognate and similarly special branches of social life. There
has hitherto been an unfortunate disposition to separate economics too sharply

from these kindred studies. When the reformer argues that political science,

jurisprudence, and the scientific principles of administration should be grouped

along with economics he is met by the rejoinder that ' we should do ona thing

at a time,' that 'division of labour' is imperatively needed in so extensive a field

of work. To so contend is to quite forget that ' division ' implies ' combination
of labour, and that mere subdivision of tasks is not of itself advantageous. The
contention, besides, goes too far for its purpose. Within the special district
assigned to economics there are very diflPerent subjects which have to be tem-
porarily kept apart. Nothing would be gained by interpolating a discussion of
the ' wages question ' into a treatise on ' money,' though no one would deny the
connexion that exists between these two parts of economics. In the same way

-- --politics in the scientific sense and jurisprudence gain when taken together with

economics, and repay that advantage by the additional light which they afford.
One of the errors fostered by the stricter economists in this country was the belief
that in political economy there was a peculiar department differing totally from
Other social and political sciences both in the rigour of its logic and the certainty
of its conclusions. Such types of precision as geometry and logic were regarded
ns the proper models in the pursuit of this ' exact ' science, whose cultivators were

justly entitled to regard with condescension those engaged in seemingly less
precise inquiries. The mistake committed was twofold. There was at once an
over-estimation of the solidity of economic doctrines and an undue depreciation of

the results obtained in politics, jurisprudence, and social ethics, with, as a natural
consequence, the severing of subjects that should have been combined to form

joint parts of a comprehensive whole. Some excuse may of course be made.

Political economy had really some advantages which enabled it to develop more

rapidly ; it dealt with material interest when measurement was often possible,

and its conclusions allowed of readier verification. It was, in fact, the first branch of

social science that came under scientific treatment, and its earlier fruits were

important enough to justify some pride on the part of those responsible for

them. But this relative superiority seems to be steadily diminishing. Other, and

for a time neglected, departments are freeing themselves from the confusion that

surrounded their infancy, while the latest developments of economics tend to

reduce the claim to peculiar rigour made in its behalf. But at any time

the distinction was injurious. By presenting to the public a small and strictly

enclosed section of social life as the sole part that admitted of scientific treatment

it weakened both what it exalted and what it debased. Economics became

henceforth something that had to be tacked on to any other subject or subjects as

present convenience happened to dictate. Its true place and the various additions

needed to give it consistency were altogether forgotten or ignored, until the study

fell into serious discredit, from which it has only partially recovered. The true

remedy is to be found in the combination of the several social sciences, together

with the exchision of everything that is extraneous. The extent to wliich this

course will facilitate the progress of social studies may be in some degree con-

ceived by considering the real unity of the field in which they work, and also the

tastes and dispositions of those who make them a leading pui-suit.

The economist, the jurist, and the political philosopher are in the main engaged

Ain examining the same phenomena, but from difierent points of view.  particular

system of land tenure, a peculiar organisation of classes, even currency or banking

regulations, have to be studied on their juristic and political as well as their

economic side. In each case there are special features which demand most atten-

tion, but it is well to be able to appreciate the other and, for the purpose, less im-

portant aspects. Nothing will bring this truth more forcibly home to us than the

ease with which the limits can be passed. When we see that much of Sir H.

Maine's writing is really economic, that J. S. Mill in parts of his ' Principles ' is deal-

ing with juridical questions, we feel the closeness of the connexion and the evil of

separation. *

From this necessity of dealing with a common material arises the disposition

on the part of economists to pass on to politics and jurisprudence. From the
time of Adam Smith to the present day there has been no lack of distinguished

--examples. The two Mills, Cairnes, Bagehot, Leslie, Hearn to give but a few

--names have made contributions to political and jural science little inferior to tlieir

services to economics. In our day have we not Professor Sidgwick's ' Elements of

Politics ' as the natural and appropriate sequel to his ' Principles of Political

Economy ? ' So in Germany Roscher closed his academic career with a treatise on

' Politics,' which forms a worthy companion to his great economic System.

In the face of such impressive facts it is idle to maintain that economic science

should be kept in isolation or joined at haphazard with other studies. The educa-

tional treatment of the matter is primarily one for the universities, but this Asso-

ciation can at least set a good example, and it is the better able to do this because

it has always recognised statistics as an equal subject with ' economic science,'

which in fact came in at a later time (1856). Now, as Senior allows, ' the science

of statistics is far wider as to its subject-matter. It applies to all phenomena Avhich

can be counted and recorded.' - There is, he thinks, no limit to the objects to be

included, provided that neither approval nor censure was expressed. Thus regarded,

statistics is the handmaid of all the social sciences, and by releasing its votaries

from this perpetual drudgery and allowing them to ' thresh out ' a little of what

they have gathered we may at once obtain a right constitution for this section as

engaged in ' statistical and social inquiry.'

The reasons in favour of adopting an organisation of wider scope are strengthened

by a reference to the actual position of economic science. After all the sustained
attacks on it from different quarters it seems to have regained some of its lost ground,
both as regards theory and practical influence. This partial recovery can be sustained
and completed only by adjustment to suit the external conditions, and must be of
tlie nature I have sought to indicate, otherwise the revival will be but temporary,

and followed by more complete collapse.
     Other countries are showing significant indications as to the true course of de-

velopment. In the United States, where economics has taken so prominent a position,
courses in social science are being established, and one university * has gone so far

as to create a chair of general sociology, in addition to the special ones assigned to

difl'erent branches of economics and politics. Another instance is much more in-
structive. France has long^ been known as the home of economic ' orthodoxy,*
which has the ' Journal des Economistes ' as its organ, and yet the last number of

that eminently respectable and conservative journal opens with an excellent article
on ' The State and Society ' belonging altogether to the domain of political science.'^
Further on in the same number there is a report of an interesting discussion at

the Political Economy Society of Paris on ' The Relation between Political
Economy and Sociology,' where, though there were differences as to the exact
nature of the relation, there were none as to its existence.^ Similar indications are
to be found in the movement of thought amongst economists in other European

nations.

    Practical considerations may also be put forward. It is highly desirable that

--certain professions law, journalism, and public administration may be mentioned

should have economics as part of the training necessary for their exercise. To
accomplish this object its combination with jurisprudence and pohtical and admin-
istrative science in a common group seems by far the best way.' The _ strictly
professional students would obtain a better and more suitable training, and it might
be reasonably expected that some with genuinely scientific tastes would be led to
take up social science as a regular pursuit, and contribute to its progress.

     But it is in dealing with the practical problems that present themselves in ever-
increasing number that this wider mode of treatment is most essential. To take first

--cases that are regarded as peculiarly within the domain of the economist is it not

true that commercial policy must largely depend on political and legal conditions ?
Even in carrying out the thoroughly wise and sound principle of free trade the British
Government finds itself involved in many curious complications. Treaties and ad-
ministrative regulations have to be taken into account. The political forces that guide
the tariff' policy of nations have their decided effects, and whether we desire merely
to estimate the actual character of any particular policy, to form a rational forecast

of the course that nations will take in the future, or to give judicious advice as to

what should be done, we cannot limit ourselves to abstract economic theory or
even to economic considerations. And this is equally true of the currency

question. The weightiest arguments for and against bimetallism are, I believe,
political rather than economic, while such social influences as habit and custom
powerfully affect the possibilities of action that purely deductive reasoning from

economic "premises might appear to suggest.

     The case becomes stronger when we turn to more fundamental and far-reaching
problems. The essential character of the socialistic movement that is passing over
Western civilisation cannot be properly judged if we look on it as merely economic.
The ordinary antithesis between socialism and individualism, or, as it is often
conceived, between self-sacrifice and selfishness, seems to me altogether misleading.

resting on the exaltation of the relatively modern institution of the State, the

--other deriving its principal force from the oldest and most enduring element of

human society the family. This aspect of the question vpiU more and more

come into prominence as the conflict proceeds. It is not the ' man of Nature,' the

individual released from all restraints, who forms the unit in our modern ' indivi-

dualistic' societies, but the individual with family ties and sentiments, and

profoundly influenced by other than purely self-regarding motives. Collectivist

socialism seeks to substitute for these natural agencies the comparatively artificial

authority of the sovereign State. It aims at transforming private into public law,

and it would make the life-work of the citizen one round of public administrative

duties. The origin of this special system is obviously due to a particular social

condition ; it is the natural product of the factory and the workmen's club i.e., of

a mode of living in which the family has unhappily sunk to a minor position, and

Howin which the main uniting bond is that of ' comradeship.'                                                              impossible it would

be to bring all human societies under a form of regulation that presupposes the

close contact of large masses of men, and bovr hopeless it is to expect its effective

worldng while the domestic organisation and family affections retain their power,

is a lesson that the study of social science in all its branches will most eflPectually

teach.

     That the time is ripe for this fuller development is, I think, clear from the interest

Awith which the most speculative works on social development are received. daring

and suggestive discussion of the problem of social evolution, even if its basis is

highly questionable, is sure of applause and a wide circle of readers. The raost

pressing duty on the part of those who desire to promote true knowledge is to

secure that there shall be the proper preliminary training on the part of the writers

and competent criticism of their productions.

Though I have dwelt mainly on the necessity for rearrangement and further

progress, I should be sorry to leave the impression that I undervalue the great

services of the English economists from Adam Smith to Senior and J. S. Mill. In

its later developments that school was open to criticism. Some of its members

committed serious faults, but they also possessed very redeeming merits. They

hard-hearted, but in studying their chosen subject they were eminently ' level-

headed.' They saw the working of material forces in their true balance, and were

not unduly influenced by passing events. This intellectual sanity and just apprecia-

tion of the comparative weight to be assigned to the different elements operating

on national life is well exemplified in an anecdote respecting Adam Smith himself,
which we have on unexceptionable authority.

* Towards the close of the American War, when general despondency seemed

to paralyse the nation, Dr. Smith, confident in the resources of the country,

would not allow himself to despair of the commonwealth. On the news of

Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga Mr. Sinclair hurried to his friend with intelli-

gence of the disaster, insisting that if affairs went on no better the nation must be

ruined. " Be assured, my young friend," replied the imperturbable philosopher,

" there is a great deal of ruin in a nation." '

This attitude of calm, based on wide historical study and accurate estimate or

the realities of things, is a valuable example which the older economists have left

to their successors. At the present day, when we are always hearing of submerged

tenths,' of depression in every branch of industry, of destructive monetary revolu-

tions, and of land abandoned by its cultivators, while we seek to trace ths reality

and extent of these evils and to discover their causes, can we give a better reply

to the eager enthusiast or the hasty innovator who insists that, unless his favourite

nostrum is adopted, ' the nation must be ruined,' than to answer, with the calm-

ness that knowledge of the forces that are working for social welfare produces, ' Be

assured there is a great deal of ruin in a nation ? '

1. The Church Army and the Unemployed. By the Rev, W. H. Hunt,

The problem of the ' Unemployed ' will always be a social as well as an

industrial one, and the difficulties of it are probably greater because of unwise

legislation and promiscuous relief. The complexity of it necessitates our rule for

individual treatment and selection. In this country many methods have already

been tried, and we recognise that no ultimate good can result to the nation from

any work based upon a false economic principle. After working upon this rule for

five years we are now able to say the social side of the problem, at least, is

can easily be secured, and the home is not calculated to disturb existing trade as a

larger establishment might do. In them local influence is combined with a strong

much encouraged. Full pay is allowed for two months, a trifle less the third

month, and less again the fourth. The effect of this rule disposes of ' shiftless

loafers,' and has been truly helpful to others. Help is allowed, if needed, sixteen

weeks, after which twelve months must elapse before freah application can be made.

proved, and is still demonstrating an experiment with more than 2,000 people per

annum, which, whilst it ensures a genuinely helpful chance to make a good start

in life for at least 50 per cent, of that number, is at the same time a powerful

object-lesson to the Church and the nation.

4. On the Report of the Labour Commission. By L. L. Price, M.A.

The Labour Commission has been engaged during the last three years in an

inquiry of a very elaborate nature, and the question may naturally be asked.
What has been the outcome of so large an expenditure of time and money ? The

answer depends on the expectations that have been formed. It is difficult to define

the proper functions of a commission. Its temporary effect is undoubtedly the

postponement of legislation, but this result is probably fraught more often with

Abenefit than injurj'.        popular cry is frequently caught up and passed on with

imdiscriminating enthusiasm, and a commission brings to light the dangers and

Adifficulties of the schemes which are thus propagated.                                  small commission of

experts is the ideal form ; but a large commission, representative of various interests,

though it may lead to an inconclusive report, does secure a searching scrutiny of

plausible proposals by hostile critics. The agitation for an eight hours' day has

been thus treated by the Labour Commission, with the result of bringing int*

prominence the doubt attaching to the real meaning of the proposal and the

difficulties  attending  its  application  to  practice                                  and, in view of this uncertainty
                                                                                      ;

and difficulty, the Commission could hardly arrive at any other conclusion than

that actually declared by the majority. They are content to present a summary

of opposing views, and to recommend minor reforms. The minority, looking for-

ward to the collectivist organisation of society, regard the legislative introduction

of an eight hours' day with approval as a step towards that organisation, and treat

from a similar standpoint the extension of the sphere of public employment. On

various minor reforms majority and minority are substantially agreed. The main

subject, however, of inquiry was the prevention of industrial disputes, and here the

Commission found that so much had been already accomplished by voluntary

Aexperimental effort that little, if any, room was left for new suggestion.              mass

of valuable material has, however, been brought together, and certain conclusions

may be drawn from it. The first is that a number of experiments have been made

in the preservation of industrial peace. The second is that, in spite of a popular

impression to the contrary, and of some failures, those experiments have been

attended by a considerable measure of success. The new unionism is in this

into prominence. The third conclusion is that the conditions of success are now

ascertained, and consist in organisation. The commissioners express this opinion
in definite language, although they enter a caution against hasty inference from it,
and the secretary's report of the position in other countries shows that an absence
of conciliatory methods accompanies immaturity of organisation. The fourth and
last conclusion is that little room is left for the intervention of the State, save in
the role of pacific counsellor. This conclusion is endorsed by the minority, in spite
of their collectivist tendencies, and various difficulties attach to the substitution
of the compulsory legal authority of the State for the moral influence of voluntary

organisation. The report of the Commission may seem petty and impotent when

contrasted with the vastness of the inquiry, but probably it will recommend itself

to sober common-sense.

       6. On Girl Life in an Industrial Centre} ByMissKETiyfARD.

     Subject of woman's work too large and complicated to allow of sweeping con-
clusions from an inquiry limited, as the present one, to a particular industrial

centre.

     The centre chosen is the district of the non-textile industries at Birmingham.

Principal trades: Brass, steel, iron, tubes, guns, ammunition, jewellery, screws^

nails, steel pens, bedsteads, chandeliers.

    The number of registered factories is three thousand, and, roughly, six men
employed to every woman. Result : Girls' labour market overstocked and com-

petition keen. The trade depression of late years makes this increasingly felt.

This condition is aggravated by growing aversion of girls to domestic service.
Reasons for this aversion are the unbusinesslike relations of the latter ; the cry
for liberty, which is greater than the cry for wages. This spirit of independence
of thought and control is fostered by the spread of education. The remedy for
equalising the factory and service markets is to place the two on an equal footing

as regards contract and inspection.

     Conditions of service are more desirable than conditions of the factory, because of

the evils produced by competition such as (a) starvation wages, which oblige girls to

eke out a livelihood dishonestly (b) frauds and deceits practised by women to
                                                                                                                                                               ;

obtain and keep work. Suggestions :

Possibility of labour agencies. Inspection in warehouses unattached to factories,

and in shops and laundries.

Position of centre as regards

--(I) Wages. For unskilled labour 7s., 8s., 9s. a week, as a rule ; 10s. a week high.

Girls of fifteen and sixteen earn 3s. 6(/. to 4s. Qd. a week. Centre probably stands,

midway as compared with Lancashire, Wales, Ireland.
--(II) Health. Lowered vitality rather than actual disease pMhisis and anfemia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

common                                      epileptic and fainting seizures also prevalent.  Specially unhealthy work
                                         ;

lacquering and enamelling of iron plates. Precautions against lead poisoning and

their disuse.

   --(III) The Moral Tone of Factory Life. Effect of married women in factories

bad. Illustrations, betting, drinking, and immorality are due in large measure to their

influence,                                  rumEflect of ' clubs,' '  teas,' ' free-and-easies ' on a girl's life.  Position

of girl in home as semi-lodger, monotony, and long hours of factory tend in the

same direction, producing a desire i'or unrestrained licence.

Improvements possible partly through legislation, combination, and partly

through the raising of relations between employer and employed from mere cash

ones,

"52 . REPORT--1894.

      Conclusion : Tliat in the mass of unskilled latour in such centres the tendency
is towards a low standard of morality, and the conditions of industrial life for
this class of girls are in greater need of reform than the present conditions of
domestic service.

           the able-bodied, (c) in regard to the not able-bodied, including the aged
          and infirm ?

(2) Is there less continuous pauperism, but more casual and intermittent
           pauperism ?

How(3) far are local habit and race instinct a barrier against pauperism ?
How(4) far is pauperism influenced by administration ?

(5) Does the rule hold good generally that reduction of outdoor relief

           reduces pauperism, and that this reduction is accompanied by a slight,
          but by no means corresponding, increase in indoor relief ?

(6) Is there reason to believe that the forces now at work, if allowed fair
         play, would reduce pauperism and State maintenance to a minimum P

          prevail in any circumstances in the community ?

    2. Proj)Osalsfor an Agreement on the Terms ^ Rent' and ^Interest.'

                                     By C. S. Devas.

  --Need of agreement in terminology to prevent fruitless discussion. Changes and'

uncertainty from the time of Adam Smith on the classitieation of incomes briefly

--illustrated. One reason for this is the abstraction that separates land from
--capital. Economic authorities for making only two requi-sities of production,
--persons and things, or labour and capital. Professor Bohm Bawerk'syiye reasons

for separating land from capital answered : First, that land is immovable, capital
mostly movable. Secondly, that land is the gift of Nature, capital the result of

--labour (Bohm Bawerk's definition of capital amended. Dr. Sidgwick's wide view
--of capital does not affect the present issue). Thirdly, that land cannot be increased,

while capital can (universal application of the law of diminishing returns).--

--Fourthly, that the social and economic position of the landowner is quite different

from that of the capitalist. Fifthly, that under certain circumstances land-rent
rises while interest falls. Conclusion, that the separation of land from capital is
logically indefensible, historically misleading, and practically inconvenient.
Classification of incomes into rewards of labour, returns from capital, and a combi-

--nation of the two. Objection on there being no place for the doctrine of rent.
--Professor Marshall on that doctrine. Character of difi'erential gains above those
--of the inarginal pair in a market. The so-called rent of land one out of many
--such differential gains. Need of one term for all such gains, and of another term
--for all receipts from property. Advantage of using the term rent for all such

--receipts, and rentier for their receiver. DifEculty from the frequent use of economic

--rent for diiferential gains and of interest for receipts from property. Need of
--coming to an agreement. The strange misunderstanding, for example, that the

economic doctrine of the Fathers, Canonists, and Theologians is socialistic could

never have arisen had our terms been clear.

       3. On the Economic Results of the Black Death in Italy.
                         By Maxime Kovalevsky.

The pestilence of 1348-49 produced all over Europe the economical results it had'

in England. The depopulation of Europe brought forward the labour question.

For the first time it had to be treated, on a large scale, as a question of almost in-

ternational importance. Without any previous agreement the Governments of

France, Aragon and Castella, as well as the political authorities of independent or

semi-dependent cities of Italy and the GermanEmpire, issued ordinances prohibiting

idleness, enforcing the obligation of farmers to pay rents, and regulating the wages

of labourers and working men. The fall of serfdom, which was almost accomplished

in Italy at the end of the thirteenth century (Piedmont and Frioul excepted),
ireated here centuries before they are found in France or Germany a large class of

free farmers (Mezzeria di Toscana, i terziafori di Lombardia, &c.) and free working

Amen.  regulation of wages appears already in the thirteenth century. Pisa,

Mantua, Nice, some Sicilian municipalities, tried to establish a legal standard of

wages. Their example was followed at the end of the pestilence by almost every

city of Middle Italy. Florence, Sienna, Orvieto, Todi, &c., issued orders and

statutes against the enhancement of wages, either according to the labourers and'

artisans the right to a supplementary pay, not surpassing the third of the wages

they got before the pestilence, or totally refusing any increase of remuneration.

-- --Venice alone tried to achieve the same end the lowering of wages by the way

of liberty. Its example was followed by dependent municipalities, such as Trevisa

or Kagusa. All encouraged emigration, according great facilities to new settlers,.

admitting tliem to the crafts, guilds, and to the exercise of commerce. Their en-

deavours were successful. At the end of the century, notwithstanding several new
appearances of the plague, the Repuhlic of St. Mark was repopulated, and the

wages fell.

   --The following Papers were read :

  1. On Inequality of Local Rates : its Extent, Causes, and Consequences.
                               By Edwin Cannan, M.A.

     The intricacy of the system under which money raised by one local authority
is usually expended by several others, the immense number of different areas
created by the overlapping of the various kinds of districts, and the inadequacy of
the published returns, make it impossible to give any very comprehensive statistics

as to the inequality of rates in England. In the small county of Oxfordshire the
number of districts governed by different combinations of rate-raising authorities

exceeds sixty, and the sum of the rates varies from about Is. Qd. to about 6s. Qd.,

the highest and the lowest rated districts being within ten miles of each other. In
the whole of England and Wales the lowest rated district pays about \s., and the
highest over 8s.

   --The chief causes of inequality of rates may be classified as follows :

         (1) Unequal returns from investments and unequal repayments of debt.
         (2) Unequal services performed for self-supporting persons by the local

                          authorities.

         (3) Inequalities of situation and circumstances which cause the same services
                     to cost imequal amounts.

         (4) Unequal endowments.
         (5) Unequal voluntary liberality.
         (6) Unequal cost of certain charges imposed by law on localities, although

                     they do not increase the advantages of a locality as a place of business

                        or residence for self-supporting persons.

         (7) Inequalities of competence or honesty on the part of the authorities.

     The consequences, considered from the point of view of just distribution, are
good so far as the inequalities are occasioned by causes 1, 2, 3, and 7, bad so far as
they are occasioned by cause 6, and haphazard so far as they are occasioned by

causes 4 and 5. Considered from the point of view of maximum productiveness

of industry, the consequences of the inequalities are good so far as they are occa-
sioned by causes 1, 2, 3, and 7, and bad so far as they are occasioned by causes 4,
o, and 6.

   2. A Few Remarks on Fifty Years' Accounts of the Bank of England.
                               By A. W. Flux, M.A.

     The completion of fifty years of the operation of the present Bank Charter,

coinciding as it does with the bicentenary of the Bank, seems a suitable occasion
for the study of the accounts.

     The active note-circulation of England and Wales is now, owing to the operation
of the Act of 1844, almost entirely in the hands of the Bank of England. The
Bank of England has fewer notes in circulation than fifteen years ago, and the
total active note-circulation of the country is hardly greater now than when the
Act was passed. The bank-note is, in fact, used in business to a much less extent
than formerly, other means of exchange and remittance, such as cheques, having-
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                            735

been substituted for it. The annual variation of the quantity of notes in circulation
has, of recent years, been much more uniform than it formerly was. The amount

of the variation is two and a half to three millions in a total of about twenty-five
millions. The year 1869 alone shows a less difference than two millions between

the minimum and maximum. There were very large variations at the time of the

1866 panic, and in the years 1878-9. In the latter case the variation consisted of
a greatly increased circulation in 1878, which did not begin to return to the
normal level till 1879 was far advanced. Taking three millions as the ordinary

variation in a year, the circulation in these years varied in excess of the normal by
2-6 and 3'8 "millions respectively. It seems rather unlikely that such large

increases of the normal variation should be due to the ordinary use of the bank-

note for making cash payments. Probably a considerable proportion of the

registered increase was merely an addition to the till-money held by bankers, and

Howwas never really in active circulation.                                                                      much of the ordinary active circula-

tion, so-called, is of the same nature there are no means of telling.

The other deposits have largely increased. Taking the half-century in five

periods of ten years, the average amount of other deposits in each period has been

about eleven, thirteen, eighteen, twenty-four, and twenty-seven and a half millions.
The considerable increase in the month of April, which was so marked during the

decennium 1844-54 that the maximum of the year was reached in the middle of
that month, has now almost vanished. The annual variation is less in proportion

to the total than formerly, having then been about 20 per cent, on either side the
average, while during the last decade it averaged hardly more than 15 per cent.

AVhat proportion of the increased deposits are bankers' balances is not known, it
being nearly twenty years since the Bank ceased to supply this useful piece of

information. The fluctuations of other deposits have, during the last ten years,

been less steady than formerly.
     The public deposits vary in a manner markedly different from that of fifty years

ago. Then there was a regular quarterly ebb and flow not differing much from
quarter to quarter. The changes iu the collection of the taxes have led to the
increase of the March maximum and the progressive decrease of the others. This
makes the maximum of total deposits fall at the end of March, in spite of the

decrease of the importance of the spring variation of other deposits.

    Taking next the coi7i and bidlion, we notice that this item shows more frequent

variation than formerly. Its amount has increased by little more than one-half as

compared with half a century ago, and the average of the last ten years is nearly

10 per cent, less than that of the preceding ten years. No information is generally

afforded as to the proportions between the coin and bullion held, or as to the

amount of silver coin in the banking department.

The reserve is the item of the account which attracts greatest attention. The

annual variation for the last ten years has averaged about 25 per cent, on either

side of the mean, while in the ten years after 1844 it was nearly 30 per cent. The
average reserve during these two decades has been about fifteen and nine millions

respectively. As the total deposits have doubled, while that part of them which

reflects most closely the business of the country, the ' other deposits,' has increased

by 150 per cent., the increase of reserve seems inadequate. For the three years

1891-2-3 the reserve has averaged sixteen millions, while the other deposits have

averaged nearly thirty-two millions.

3. On the ' Economic Heresies ' of the London County Council.
                     By Sidney Webb, LL.B., L.C.C.

The Council has been intelligently criticised, from an economic point of view,

mainly on three grounds : {a) its adoption of a ' standard ' and ' moral minimum '

of wages, and consequent refusal to take advantage of the fiercest competition in

reducing  the  price of labour                                                                        (6)  its  attempt  to  ensure  that all contractors exe-
                                                                                                   ;

cuting work for the Council should adopt the same policy ; and (c) its supersession
                                                                                                                                                                              ;;

736 REPORT-- 1894.

of the contractor, wherever possible, by the direct employment of workmen under

salaried management.
     The facts and statistics piven in the paper show precisely what has been done

in these respects, together with such economic results as can already be discerned.

It is contended that the Council's action is warranted by all administrative expe-

rience, and that it has the support of economic science. It is suggested that the
' economic heresy ' is with the opponents of this policy. The experience of the

National Government, other local authorities, and private customers is adduced in

support of the policy of insisting that contractors should act on a like principle.

The contractor's tendency, if let alone, is to seek his profits in a diminution, not

necessarily of the cost of production to the community, but of the expenses of pro-

duction to himself. The lesson of economic science is that it is advantageous to the

community that there should be a constant upward shifting of the plane on which

competition works (cf. the Factory, Sanitarj', and Adulteration Acts), and espe-
cially that its pressure should be taken off the standard of life, and placed on the

brains of the administrators and directors of industry.

The supersession of the contractor, or entrepreneur, by direct employment under

salaried management is shown to be part of a widespread tendency, common not

only to other governing bodies, but also to large industrial undertakings of every

kind. This ' integration of processes ' can be traced in all important undertakings.

So far as the change of policy can be assigned to a particular date, it appears to

have taken place between 1875 and 1885. Economic advantage in this suppression

of the subsidiary entrepreneur, or contractor, is found {a) in saving middleman

profit                         (6) in saving expense of incessant  checking of  the                                                                 quality of  his  product
                            ;

and (c) in increased convenience of having all parts of work done under direct

control. The London County CouncQ, in doing as much as possible of its own

work, is thus merely conforming to an industrial tendency, strongly marked, not

only in other local governing bodies, but also throughout the industrial world.

The elimination of the contractor may or may not be economic heresy, but the

business history of England during the past twenty years indicates that it is

industrial orthodoxy. Formerly the best business management was held to be

that which managed least ; nowadays it is that which can safely and efficiently

administer most.

                               4. On Co-operation in Agriculture. By Harold Moore.

It was pointed out that many systems of working land in order to give the

workers the profits earned by them had been tried. These were divided into four

classes, viz., communal farming, being those cases where the co-operators worked

on equal terms for the benefit of the community, as tried at Ratalime in Ireland

co-operative tenancy, where the co-operators jointly took the position of ordinary

tenants, as at Assington in Sufiblk, and elsewhere profit-sharing, where the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

labourers had some share in the management, as tried by Lord Spencer in North-

amptonshire                    and  by  Mr. Bolton King  in        Warwickshire                                                                     and  profit-sharing  as  a
                                                                                                                                                 ;

voluntary arrangement made by landowners working their own property, as

carried out by Mr. Albert Grey in Northumberland and by others. The reasons

why the first three systems were not likely to be successful were pointed out, and

it was urged that for co-operation in agriculture to succeed it was necessary that

distinct individual interest should be combined with those advantages which

co-operation would give. This it was claimed could be done by the establishment

of the intending co-operators on one farm, giving to each one a particular portion

of the land on perpetual lease or other secure tenure, and securing for their

general benefit agricultural credit banks, farm factories, and other means of co-

operation which would assist in working the land and realising that portion of the-

produce which would not be consumed. Instances were then given of this system

of co-operation which is now being introduced with useful results, it being finally

urged that this was the best system by which those agricultural labourers now in

    3. On the Relation between Wages and the Numbers employed in the
               Coal-mining Industry. By R. H. Hooker, M.A.

     The influence of wages in attracting labour to an industry is best shown by means
of a diagram, and the industry concerning which we possess the most trustworthy
statistics of wages and of the numbers employed over a series of jears is un-
doubtedly coal mining. The data concerning this occupation have accordingly
been plotted on the annexed dianrrani, in which the upper (continuous) line repre-
sents the course of wages in 1871-91 in the county of Durham (according to the

evidence of Mr. L. Wood before the Labour Commission '), while the lower

(dotted) line shows the number of persons employed in coal mining in the same
county (taken from the annual reports of the mining inspectors). The wages
are expressed in percentages above or below the rate paid in 1871.

be ascribed to any other cause than to the attraction of the preat rise in wages at

those periods. It must be remembered that the coal-mining industry is in many
lespects peculiar, the organisation of the men is very complete, and the principle

of the slidirjg scale is everywhere in force, even in those districts where a scale
does not actually determine the wages. These latter being then dependent on
prices, employers cannot lower their rate of pay when the supply of labour is un-
usually large, nor can they raise the remuneration unless there is a corresponding
change in the price of coal. It would seem, then, that the numbers depend on the
"wages. It does not follow that this condition prevails in every occupation, but it
is probable that, according as the organisation of the men in any industry is more
compicte, there is a greater tendency in that industry for the numbers employed
to follow the wases.

 4. Popular Attitude towards Economics. By Rev. L. R. Phelps, M.A.

     Economics once a rule of conduct, now either contemned or patronised.

   --History of the change of opinion.

      Reasons for the change :

      1. On the part of economists :

            Desertion of the a priori method.
            Attempts to generalise from an existing state of things.
            Tendency to be content with an historical explanation of facts.

      2. On the part of the public

             Dislike of exercise of reasoning powers.
            Tendency to substitute an appeal to sentiment for appeal to reason.
            Impatience of slow growths.

      Possible remedies :

     A1. narrowing and defining of the field of economics.

       2. Education of the public by experience.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.

            Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

--President of the Section Professor A. B. W. Kennedy, LL.D., F.R.S.,

                                                     M.Inst.C.E.

                        THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

The President delivered the following Address :

The Critical Side of Mechanical Training.

While there is no place in the kingdom more suitable for a meeting of the British

Association than Oxford, and certainly no place in which it is more delightful iov

the members to meet, it is yet to be admitted that there are few places which

have much less in common with the special work of Section G. Nominally

devoted to ' Mechanical Science,' the Section has for many years specially dealt

with those branches of applied mechanical science which constitute the business of

--the engineer to quote the well-known words of the Royal Charter, ' the art of

directing the great sources of power in Nature for the use and convenience of man.'

The association of this ancient and learned city with boilers and chimneys, with

the noise and racket of ordinarj' mechanical work, seems an incongruity. Even

the harmless necessary railway station is kept as far away as possible, and the

very river flows with a quiet dignity which seems to shut out the thought of

anything more mechanical than the most ancient and futile of water-wheels.

Naturally enough these considerations did not tend to make more easy the

choice of a subject ibr this address, and I have come very near to agreement with

a recent critic in the opinion that presidential addresses are, in fact, almost

immoral in the nature of ihhigs and fit only to be abolished. Finally, I decided upon

taking up my present subject, as being one in which the academic rather than the

technical side of our work comes to the front, while at the same time it does not lead

me out of lines in which I have been able, in past years, to work myself. It is now

twenty years since I first took any active part in the scientific training of engineers,

and five since I ceased to do so. T have often wished that I may have been at all

as successful in teaching others at University College as I was, at the same time, in

teaching myself. And since I have ceased to teach I seem to have been spending

my time in fiodinpr out how much better I could now do it than was possible when

I was actually engaged in it.  This  may be  pure  imagination  on  my part                                   there
                                                                                                           ;

is nothing more easy, as we all know, than to suppose that we know best how to

do the things that other people do, and not the things we have to do ourselves.

Indeed, I understand that tliis is the recoo;nised attitude of the really superior

critic. If, however, in anything which I have to say, it should stem that I am

finding fault with what is now being done, I may at least point out that most of all

I am finding fault with myself for not having done right when I had ihe opportu-

--nity an opportunity which can now never recur. Indeed, instead of the decorous

and unobtrusive heading which I have given to this address, I might have indicated

its general lines almost as truly if I had entitled it ' The Regrets of an Emeritus
                                                                                                                  BO iS

740 REPORT-- 1894.

--Professor ' a name -which, on a suitable binding, might even have secured it a sale

at the railway bookstalls.

   -- --I know well too well that in the present congested state of the engineering

profession there are many of us who do not like to hear the word ' training

mentioned at all. It seems to mean merely the preparation of more lads to
struggle for a share of work that is even now insufficient to go round. There is no
doubt much to be said for this point of view. But against it one must remember

that all other professions are equally full, and that, after all, lads must do some-

thing. The fault is surely that there are too many lads ! If our population is

--really to go on increasing as rapidly as at present the benefits of which Sections D,
--E, and F might have a joint meeting to discuss, if not to discover it is inevitable

that demands should come for more and more complete professional preparation.
The man of exceptional parts will come to the fi-ont under any conditions, training

--or no training, in the future as in the past. But for ordinary men that is, for
--99 per cent, of us it is essential that no advantage should be given to a rival in

the tierce competition of life, and for them therefore it is of an importance hardly

to be exaggerated to obtain the most complete and perfect training possible. At

the same time, and on purely general grounds, it can hardly be denied that to raise

the standard of our profession is indirectly to confer a benefit on the whole com-

munity. I hope, therefore, that in making certain suggestions about the training

of engineers, it will not be thought that I am desirous of increasing their number,

which is really an end as far as possible from my own wishes. Whether the

number increases or stands still or falls off, it is of importance from every point of

view that those who come forward should be as well prepared as possible. And

 even the most conservative of us are compelled to recognise that the standard

,

 required in engineers' offices now is enormously higher than it was thirty years

ago. This may truly be either the cause or the effects of improved training, but in

either case it has made the training itself a necessity.

The particular aspect of mechanical training of which I wish to speak is its

critical side. I do not know how a man should be trained to be an inventor. I

--would not tell anyone if I did ! To be a creator in mechanical matters which,
--however, is a quite different thing is a faculty given only to a very few, and with

them it is ' born, not made.' Many of us, however, without being either inventors

or creators, have sufficient natural aptitude or inclination towards things mechanical

to form a basis for the trainer or educator to work on, with some hope that he
may be of service. About the sciences which should be taught to such men, or the

methods of teaching them, about the extent and nature of their experience in shops

or on works, I do not intend to speak. I shall confine myself to one aspect of the

training only, an aspect which is perhaps not always sufficiently clearly kept

--in view the aspect which I have just called the critical side of mechanical

training.

An engineer is a man who is continually being called upon to make up his

mind. It may be only as to the size of a bolt ; it may be as to the type of a Forth

Bridge                              it may be as to the method of lighting a city ;  or only as to the details of
                                 ;

--a fire-grate. But, whatever it is, once it is settled it is decided irrevocably it is

translated into steel and iron and copper, and cannot be revoked by an Act passed

in another session.. The time given him in which to decide may be a day, or a

month, or a year, but in any and every case (so far as my own experience goes)

--it is about one-tenth part of the time which he would like to have. It is only in

rare cases that the decision is obvious most often there are more courses open

than even the most facile politician ever dreamt of. The matters are too complex

to be dealt with mathematically or even physically ; even if they were not, there

are few engineers who would have the special capacity to handle "tht^m. Moreover,

their solutions are seldom ' unique.' From this point of view, the whole use of

college training, of workshop practice, of practical experience, is to provide the

engineer later on with the means of critically examining each question as it comes

up, of reviewing systematically the pros and cons of each method of dealing with

it, of coming finally, rapidly, and positively to some defensible decision, which may

then be irrevocably carried out.
   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  741

        In the case of a problem in pure mathematics or physics, where only one right
   solution can exist, that solution is arrived at by the help of a thorough knowledge

   --of the science in question there is little room for the critical faculty except as to

   --method the result is either right or wrong. With our work, on the other hand,
   --solutions of all problems except the very simplest in other words, decisions on all

   points which present themselves-- can be arrived at only by a process of criticism
   applied to the problems, to their statement, to their condition, to all their many
   possible solutions. The development of the necessary critical faculty should be
   one of the chief aims of every teacher and every student.

      A scientihc training cannot make a man an engineer. Perhaps it is impossible

   for anything to make a man an engineer unless he has grown that way from the
   beginning! But a scientific training may make him, or at least give him the possi-

   bility of making himself, a critic.
        In the vigorous attempts which have been made to specialise the education of

   engineers very early, 1 am afraid that the idea of teaching subjects is sometimes

   too prominent, to the neglect of matters less obviously useful. It is, of course, one

   thing to know a subject Irom the examination point of view, and quite another to

   be able to think about it, and still another to be able to write about it. In parti-

   cular, I have often regretted to find how little attention has been given to a matter
   which perhaps may be called literary rather than scientific, but which is all-impor-
   tant in criticism, I mean to the power of expression. It is not easy to overrate

   the importance to the engineer, as to other folk, of the power of saying clearly
   what he means, and of saying just what he means. I do not mean only of doing

   this for its own sake, but because if a man cannot say or write clearly what he
   means it is improbable tbat he can think clearly. By the power of expression

   I do not mean, of course, the mere power of speaking fluently in public, a thing
   which appears physically impossible to some people ; I mean rather the power of
   expression in writing, which carries with it clearness and consecutiveness of thought.
   It is difficult to know how this matter can be taught, but at least it can be in-

   Asisted upon probably to a much greater extent than is commonly the case.

   man requires to see clearly not only the exact thing which he wants to say, but
   the whole environment of tbat thing as it appears to him. Not only this, but he

   must see the whole environment of the same thing as it appears to the persons

   for whom he is writing, or to whom he is speaking. He has to see what they

   know about the matter, what they think, and what they think they know, and if
   he wishes to be really understood has got to do much more than merely write the

   thing he means. He has carefully to unwrite, if I may use the expression, the

   various things that other people will be certain to think that he means. For after

   all the great majority of people are very careless listeners and readers, and it is not

   for the small minority who are really exact in these matters that one has to v/rite.

   Moreover, it is a great help to clearness of thought and expression to keep before

   one always an ide.al audience of people who will certainly misunderstand every single
   sentence about which any misunderstanding is in any way possible, and some ethers

   as well.

         In attempting to think out or to discuss any question, whether it be technical or

   non-technical, in fact, as long only as it is non-political, the first necessity is pro-

   bably a knowledge of the question itself, and not only this, but also a proper
   understanding of its whole environment. This knowledge must be of such a kind
   as to distinguish what parts of it are important, what parts of it are unimportant,

   what parts can be described in two sentences, and what others may require as
   many paragraphs ; what parts afl'ect the result but little, however large they seem ;

   and which ones must be considered vital, although their very existence is difficult

   to discover. The faculty which enables a man to handle his knowledge in this
   fashion may be summed up in the single expression ' sense of proportion.' More-

   over, the knowledge, to be of real value, must be as totally free from prejudices

   and prepossessions as in the most rigorous branch of pure science, and as thoroughly

    imbued with a healthy spirit of scepticism.
         One is accustomed to think of engineering work as mainly constructive. But

   after all it is quite as much critical. In almost every department of mechanical

I
--742 REPORT 1894.

work there are half a dozen ways of solving any particular prohleni. In some

fashion or other the enp;ineer must he ahle to judge between these various methods,

methods which are often very much alike, but each of which may possess certain

particular advantages and certain particular drawbacks. The arithmetical criticism

which merelj' counts the advantages and the drawbacks, and puts an equal number

of the one against an equal number of the other, is common enough, hut obviously

useless. The ^ery first necessity to the critic is that he should have what I have

just called the sense of proportion, a sense which will enable him to distinguish

mere academical objections from serious practical difficulties, which shall euable

him to balance twenty advantages which can be enumerated on paper by one

serious drawback Avhich will exist in fact, which will enable him in fact to place

molehills of experience against moimtains of talk. It is perhaps a doubtful point

how far this sense of proportion can be taught at all. No doubt it can only be built

up upon some natural basis. I am sure tliat in engineering we all know men whose

judgment as to whether it was advisable to take a particular course we would

accept implicitly, because we know that it is based on large general criticism, in spite
of the most elaborate and specious arguments against it set down on paper. Any

-- --third-year student not to go still further back can criticise perfectly along

certain very narrow lines, just as anyone can learn the rules of harmony and can

write something in accordance with them which purports to be music. But after

all the music may be music only in name, and the criticism may not be worth the

paper it is written upon, however formal it may appear to be, unless the writer is

thoroughly imbued with a sense of the proportionate value of the different points

which he makes. To take the commonest possible case, I dare say we have all

of us heard certain methods, mechanical, chemical, or other, stigmatised as totally

wrong and absolutely useless because they contain certain easily provable errors.

I am sure, too, that most of us could give illustrations of cases in which this has

been said with the very greatest dogmatism when the errors of the impugned

method are not one-tenth part as great as the equally unavoidable errors of obser-

vation in the most perfect method.

Probably the best special education in proportion which a man can have is

a course of quantitative experimental work. I say qitantitative with emphasis,

aa meaning something much more than mere qualitative work. Here, I think,

Wecomes in the usefulness of the engineering laboratory.                                                                                                     require that the

training should be not only in absolute measurement, but in relative measurement,

the latter being quite as important as the former. Many kinds of measurements

stand more or less upon a level as a training of the faculties of observation in

themselves, but no single kind of measurement is sufficient as a training in

Aproportion.    year spent in calibrating thermometers or galvanometers might

make an exceedingly accurate observer in a particular line, but it would not give

the observer a knowledge of what even constituted accuracy in other directions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

for accuracy is a relative and not an absolute term. In most engineering matters

the conditions  are, unfortunately, of  a  most complex kind                                                                                             so  complex that our
                                                                                                                                                      ;

problems are incapable of anj' solution sufficiently exact to satisfy the mathe-

matician or physicist. The temptation to treat these problems as the mathe-

--matician treats those with which he deals namely, to alter the assumed
--conditions in order to get an exact solution is a very strong one. I am afraid

it is most strong often in those engineers who are the best mathematicians. It is

Wea temptation, however, steadily to be resisted.  must assume our conditions

to be what they actually are, and not what we should like them to be ; and if we
cannot obtain an exact solution of our problem with its actual conditions, so much

the worse for us, not so much the worse for the conditions. Our first duty is

generally to find out the conditions; if they are disadvantageous (in fact I mean,

and not merely in the problem), to alter them if they can be altered, but not to

Weignore them because they are inconvenient.  have then to find out the extent

to which the known conditions permit any exactness of solution at all, and,
finally, we have to keep this in view as a measurement of the highest accuracy

which is attainable. To work out certain branches of the problem with such

minuteness as to give us apparently very much greater accuracy than this is not
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  743

only useless, but is apt to bo positively misleading, as giving an impression of an

accuracy which has no real existence.
     The relative value of accuracy in different sets of observations is iu itself a

matter in which a sense of proportion is wanted, and often very badly wanted.

Where one has to measure half a dozen things of which two are very easily

measured and the remaining four are only measurable with great difficulty, it is

only human nature that we should spend our energies on getting extremely
accurate results with the first two and roughly do our best with the others. It

is very difficult under such circumstances to remember that the accuracy of the
whole is not the accuracy of the best part of our work, but of the worst.

     The extraordinary eftiact of a want of sense of proportion is nowhere better shown
than in the absurd statements which are constantly made as to technical matters in
public prospectuses, and the still more absurd statements made in those very
numerous documents of a similar kind of which some of us see a great many, but
which do not finally emerge into public view. Fortunes are apparently to be made
by inventions which, although doubtles? ingenious, yet only concern one way of
doing a thing which could be done equally well in half a dozen other ways. Every
one is expected to run after a piece of apparatus which is to save 50 per cent, of

something, the total cost of that something, however, being so very small that

nobody cares to save in it at all. I need hardly mention the all too common case

where" a contemplated saving of 10 per cent, in the cost of a material works out

yearly to an amount much more than equal to the whole cost of the original article.
     Ibelieve that experimental work in an engineering laboratory can educate this

critical sense of proportion very admirably in a number of ways In the first place,

it directs quantitative work into very varied channels, and not along one particular
line. Secondly, it compels the observer to combine a number of measurements in

such a way that the relative importance of accuracy in each can be seen. In the

case of an engine trial, for instance, the combined results are affected by the
accuracy of measurements of the dimensions of the machine, by the apparatus and
methods used for measuring the water, by the indicator, and by its springs, by the

speed counter, by the thermometers, and so on. An error of 1 per cent, in counting

the revolutions is just as important as an error of 1 per cent, in measuring tho

water, or in measuring the mean pressure. I am afraid that one could point to a
good many cases in which this has been more or less forgotten. Then, by making

a series of measurements all in absolute quantities, the relative importance of each
quantity to the desired total result can be seen. Thus it will be found that changes

in certain quantities affect the total result to a A-ery small extent, while changes in
others affect it very largely, .so that not only is the accuracy with which different

quantities can be determined very different, but also the same degree of accuracy
is of very different importance according to the particular quantity to which it
refers. Once it is found that a final result is exceedingly little affected by a par-

ticular set of changes, it ceases to be of importance to measure or observe those

changes in any extremely minute way, and of course the reverse holds equally good.

mFinally, and this perhaps is the most 'important matter of all, measurements such

 a laboratory are made to a great extent under the complicated conditions under
which the actual final result has to be obtained in practical work. They are not made

 under the conditions which insure the greatest individual accuracy of each result.
      It will be seen that throughout, but particularly in the two last points which I

 have mentioned, the work of an engineering laboratory is in intention and in
essence different from that of a physical laboratory. The aim of the latter is to

 make its problems as simple as possible, to eliminate all disturbing elements or

 influences, and to obtain finally a result which possesses the highest degree of abso-
 lute accuracy. In most physical investigations the result aimed at is one in which

 practically absolute accuracy is attainable, although attainable only if infinite pains

 be taken to get it. It is the business of the physicist to control and modify his
 conditions, and to use only those which permit of the desired degree of accuracy
 being reached. In such investigations it sometimes becomes almost immoral to

 think of one condition as less important than another. Every disturbing condition
 must be either eliminated or completely allowed for. That method of making the

experiment is tbe best which ensures the greatest possible accuracy in every part

of the result. The business of the engineer, on the other hand, is to deal with

physical problems under conditions which he can only very partially control, and

the conditions are a part of his problem. He does not, for instance, experiment

with a steam engine so made that it can work with a Carnot cycle. It is in the

nature of the case that he must experiment with a much less perfect machine. In

burning fuel he does not use apparatus specially made to absorb the whole heat of

combustion, but in the nature of the case has to investigate the behaviour of appa-

ratus in which a very large part of that heat is unavoidably wasted. So one might

go on through an immense number of instances. Perhaps the whole matter may best

he summed up by saying that in a physical laboratory the conditions of each experi-

ment are under the control of the experimenter, and are subservient to the experi-

ment itself. In an engineering laboratory the conditions form part of the experiment.

--However much more ditlicult or complicated they render it, they still unavoidably

form part of it an experiment under any other conditions, or with those condition*

removed, would ipso facto he irrelevant.

   A critical training in matters mechanical is, however, only too similar to the

celebrated training of the Mississippi pilot which so nearly broke the heart of

Mr. Mark Twain. Whenever the whole matter seems to be completely mastered

from one point of view, it is only to find, with a little more experience, that from

another point of view everything looks different, and the whole critique has to be-

--started afresh. Machines cannot be finally criticised that is to say, they cannot
--be pronounced good or bad simply from results measurable in a laboratory. One

wishes to use steam plant, for instance, by which as little coal shall be burnt as

possible. Ikit clearly it would be worth while to w-aste a certain amount of coal

if a less economical machine would allow a larger saving in tbe cost of repairs. Or

it might he worth while to use a mnchine in which a certain amount of extra

power was obviously employed, if only by means of such a machine the cost of

attendance could be measurably reduced. In fact, what may be summed up in

the phrase the ' worth-whileness ' of economies, is in itself a matter on which a

whole paper might be written. Unfortunately, the latter points which I have

mentioned are just such as cannot easily be measured in laboratory work, or,

indeed, in any other way whatever, except by actually using the apparatus im

question. All that can be said is that a careful training in the critical measure-

ment of comparatively simple points fits a man more than anything else to gauge

accurately the importance of such other matters as I have mentioned. No doubt
there are many men in whom the critical faculty is insufficiently developed to-

allow them ever to be of use in these matters, but to those who are intellectually

capable of the ' higher criticism ' it must be, I think, of inestimable benefit to

have had a systematic training in the lower.

Is there, then, any general standpoint from which mechanical criticism can he

directed ? Certain points are obvious, but probably the whole matter cannot

Aeasily be gener.alised.  city has to be supplied with water; there are three

requisites : that the water should he of proper quality, of sufficient quantity, and

that it should be brought in at a reasonable cost. But in such a case the first two

are so enormously more important than the third, that the ideal is comparatively

Asimple (of course, this is quite a different thing from being simply reached).

city has to be supplied with electric light : the essential conditions are similar.

But in this case there are so many qualities which are equally proper, and

there are so many different ways of bringing it in in sufficient quantity, that the

                                                                   factory has to

be driven by steam power : the amount of power that is wanted can be produced

--by so many different types of engine and boiler all capable of approximately equal
--economy, and all claiming equal freedom Irom breakdowns that the choice is a

peculiarly difficult one from the critical point of view.

It seems almost impossible that a criticism on any one basis could meet all the

three cases which I have supposed, unless that basis were that the thing supplied

should be the absolutely fittest, having regard to all the conditions of each case

and the relative importance of each condition. Possibly in all cases we could get

at some generalisation which would show us which was the absolutely fittest, if
only the necessary data were in any way complete, which they very seldom are.
Perhaps in one sentence we may say that that scheme, or system, or machine, will

be the absolutely best in any particular case which will the longest survive and

maintain its place in its particular environment. I cannot doubt that this

development of Darwinian ideas in the world of the inorganic is a legitimate one.

Of course the problem would be comparatively easy in each particular case if only

the environment would stand still. It would even be comparatively easy if w&
Weknew how the environment was going to alter, but this we are unable to do.

only know that it certainly ivill change and will go on changing, and that there-

fore the things which we make now have not got to survive in the conditions
in which we make them, bat have got to survive through some new sets
of conditions of which we know nothing. I do not think the difHculty is in

any way met by the popular method of guessing at what will be wanted fifty

years hence, which generally means simply guessing at something very big. It is

of no use making our ships or our engines of a type which we choose to imagine

will be that of fifty years hence. If we do they will be of no use to-day, and for

that very reason they will not even be in existence, useful or other, at the end of

the fifty years. Sufficiently sad illustrations of this will occur to everyone in very

different directions. I hope I shall not be considered churlish in saying that I do

not think that the men who have worked on this principle have really been far-

seeing, or have really brought us much forward. They have been men often of

genius, often of great personal fascination, always of immense imagination. But

ihey have proceeded by methods essentially opposed to anything like the gradual

evolution which must occur in technical as it does in natural matters, and in too

many cases the results of their labours have not even been giants, but only monsters.

As to wliat causes one thing to survive rather than another we can only speak

ver}' generally. Mere survival may come about by the accident of a peculiarly

Atough constitution.  few engines built in the time of James "Watt are still to be

found at work in our own day, but can no more be taken as the fittest type than

some solitary megatherium would be who, having outlived all his contemporaries,

was able in after ages to look down upon his pigmy and short-lived successors.

Mere length of life in such a case may be a mere accident, and is not itself a proof

Weof fitness.  have it thrown at us every now and then that our engines nowa-

days do not last like the old ones, as if the mere existence of a very old machine

were a proof of its virtues. It is certainly a proof of the excellence of its

-- --construction or, as one may say, of its constitution and perhaps also of the very

small amount of work it has done in proportion to its life and its dimensions.

    It is sometimes, I am afraid, rather humiliating to have to remember that, to a

very great extent, the question of the fittest, so far as it affects Uc, is a financial

one. In manufacturing processes etficiency and economy tend to survival because

they lead to decreased cost of production. In structures or other large permanent

works those types tend to perpetuate themselves which require the least material

--that is, in which the material used is disposed to the best advantage and in which

the outlay on labour is also smallest, assuming, of course, equal fitness in other

respects. There is, no doubt, at present a tendency to dispute this altogether, and

to treat all reductions in cost of labour as disadvantageous, unless, indeed, the

labour be very highly skilled, in which case its remuneration must necessarily be
brought down for tlie sake of equality ! I imagine this tendencj' will last exactly

as long as the faithful can get some other people to pay the increased cost, and

will thereafter determine itself somewhat suddenly. It can no more stand in the
way of natural progress in engineering matters than could the somewhat similar

outcry against the introduction of machinery into manufactures two generations

ago. It would be as wise to paint a generation of cats green, in the hope of com-

pelling natural selection to work along new lines.
    I think we may fairly assume, therefore, that efficiency and economy are both

legitimate criteria as to ultimate fitness, and will remain so. Moreover, they are

both matters in which measurements can be made, and as to which judgment

can be guided by such measurements. But there are other characteristics, not
746 REPORT-- 1894.

directly measurable, by which we can in some degree form an opinion as to the

ultimate fitness of things or processes.

One set of considerations which has great critical importance is summed up in

the word simplicity. This does not mean fewness of parts. Reuleaux showed

long ago tliat with machines there was in every case a practical minimum number

of parts, any reduction below which was accompanied by serious practical draw-

backs. Nor is real simplicity incompatible with considerable apparent complexity.

The purpose of machines is becoming continually more complex, and simplicity

must not be looked at as absolute, but only in its relation to a particular

purpose. There are many very complex-looking pieces of apparatus in existence

which work actually so directly along each of tlieir many branch lines as to be in

reality simple. I believe it almost always happens that the first attempt to carry

out by a machine a new purpose is a very complicated one. It is only by the

closest possible examination of the problem, the getting at its very essence, that

the machine can be simplified, and this is a late and not an early stage of design.

If a mechanical problem is really only soluble by exceedingly complicated appa-

ratus, it generally becomes a question whether the solution is worth having. There

is no impossibility in making a machine that will do anything. But the very

simplest possible form of apparatus which would wash our hands for us in a suit-

able manner is probably so very complicated that for many years to come at least

that operation will be performed by manual labour.

Very closely allied to simplicity is what I may call directness. In nearly all

mechanical processes certain transformations are unavoidable. In many mechanical

processes, as I have recently had occasion to mention, a very large number of trans-

formations is at present practically unavoidable. I myself cannot help thinking

that probably one of the most distinct signs of fitness is a reduced number of

transformations, the bringing of the final and the initial stages as close together as

possible, and cutting out altogether the apparently worthless middle processes.

But any generalisation of this kind must be very cautiously handled; these

apparently useless processes are no doubt in certain cases as indispensable as is the

much abused middle-man in matters economic.

In a critical view of any case where similar results are aimed at by hand work

and by mechanical means, it is important to recognise that the similarity of result

ehould very seldom become identity. In the first machine to do anything mechani-

cally which has before been done by hand, the error is often made of trying to

imitate the hand-work rigorously. The first sewing machines were, I believe,

made to stitch in the same way as a seamstress. It was not until a form of stitch

suitable for a machine, although unsuitable for hand, was devised that the sewing

machine proved successful as a practical matter. In another but analogous line, too,

you may remember that the first railway carriages were practically stage coaches put

upon trucks, from which the present carriages have only very slowly been evolved.

The critic has also to remember that very often the attainment of some very

unimportant point, or point of which the importance has been greatly exaggerated,

is made the reason mechanically for very great complication. The question of

proportion comes in here again, and it has to be considered in any particular case

whether the academically perfect machine, which is also extremely complicated, is

--not inferior to the almost equally good machine which has been constructed in a

practicable shape it almost always is so.

    I have endeavoured in my remarks to indicate what appears to me to be the

attitude of the engineer towards a very large portion of the work which comes

into his hands. In order to deal with the work it is necessary for him first of

all to have a certain definite knowledge of 'things,' that is to say, both of the

various subjects which form part of the curricula of all technical schools, and of

the further matters which form as it were his professional alphabet. These last

he learns not from books or lectures as a student, but by example and attempt, as

does an artist.  Of  this  part  of  his  training  I  have  said  nothing                                       it  has  been

perhaps sufficiently talked about of late years, and there is little to say which I

could have made interesting to a general gathering like this. I cannot leave it

altogether, however, without dealing with one matter. Exceptional men are all-

round mathematicians or physicists, still more exceptional men are both ; but for

ordinary folk the study of one side of mathematics or of a single branch of physics

is the work of a lifetime. The engineer is bound to know his own profession, by

hypothesis, and it is in itself no small matter. Yet in addition he must know-

some mathematics, some physics, some chemistry, even also some geology, if he is

to take any high rank in it. It is, therefore, surely in the very nature of things
impossible that he should be a great mathematician or a great physicist, or should

devote as much study to those most fascinating sciences as if they themselves
Amy-were the work of his life. Therefore I beseech
                                                            friends of Section                to do
--what they can to modify their natural attitude of superiority even of contempt
--towards us, especially when we are students. The young engineer I speak as a
--member of the great majority of the ordinary kiud would probably never have

chosen his profession if he had had special aptitude for mathematical work.
Having chosen it, he has to look at mathematics simply as a tool, a means to an

end, not an end in itself. I cannot myself see that this point of view is one dis-

respectful to the parent of all the sciences, and I am confirmed by the knowledge

--that one or two of the greatest mathematicians in the country are of the same

opinion and have the courage to act on it with infinitely beneficial results to the

-- --young men they have to deal with. But I know that to mathematicians in

general the physicists are not so bad the very name of engineering student
is odious, indicating only a man who wilfully refuses to make mathematics

his ' first subject,' and who therefore deserves neither consideration nor quarter,

to whom it is privilege sufficient that he should be allowed to pick up

such crumbs as he can digest from a table prepared for his betters. I humbly

protest that we deserve better treatment. It is no doubt a great mis-

fortune to us that we cannot afl'ord to spend our training-time preparing for

examinations, and that we have been compelled to choose for our future a career

in which mathematics plays only a secondary part. It is our further misfortune

that we have to solve twenty real live problems, each demanding a real live

answer, for every single one which otherwise we would have worked out on paper.

-- --Perhaps it is also our misfortune or it may be only our thickheadedness to

believe that in consequence of this we are quite able to judge for ourselves what

units it is most convenient for us to work in, what nomenclature satisfies our

requirements,  and  that  we  are  as  capable  of getting  our  '       '  in  their  right  places

as even some of our distinguished critics. But this is the end of the nineteenth

century : philanthropy fills our breasts. May not our misfortunes call out some

pity and not alone contempt .^ In spite of solemn warnings which I have lately

received in the Press against the monstrous idea that a presidential address should

contain any individual opinions, I venture to repeat here what I had lately an

opportunity of saying before a Royal Commission, that in cases where a university

or university college takes in hand the preparation of engineers (and I hope that

such cases will grow in number) they should provide for them special training in

mathematics, and probably also in physics, distinct from the general training in

these subjects most suitable for Degrees. I say this with the full knowledge that

I may be accused of wishing to degrade the purity of scientific work, and, at the
same "time, with the full knowledge that I have no such wish. On the contrary,

this special training is the only means by which the rank and file of us will ever

know any mathematics at all. And I can say from my own knowledge that, if
only we can be made what I may call mathematically articulate beings, we shall

bo able to repay the kindness by placing before the man of pure science problem

after problem of transcendent difficulty, of immense interest, and having no

single drawback -whatever except that its solution may really be * useful ; ' and,

after all, this need not be brought too prominently imder his notice.

    This digression has turned out a long one. I have only further to say that my

main object in this address has been to indicate, as well as I could, the general

attitude which the engineer must of necessity take up towards much of his work

the point of view from which he must look at it. I shall be extremely glad if any-

-- --thing which I have said should cause this attitude this point of view to be more

clearly kept in mind in the period of training than probably has been hitherto the

case.

               2. On Bore-hole Wells for Town Water-supply.
                        By Henry Davey, M.Inst.C.E.

At the Cardiff Meeting of this Association the author proposed a new system

of bore-hole wells for town water-supply. Since that time the system has

been carried into effect at several places, and he described one of the most important

examples of executed work, viz., that of the Netherley Pumping Station of the

"Widnes Waterworks. The subject was dealt with under two heads :

\st. The system of bore-holes.

--2nd. The application of the pumping power.

I. The Syste7)i of Bore-holes. In procuring water for town water-supply it is

the usual and necessary practice to provide duplicate pumping engines, and where

two engines are made to pump from the same well, the well must be very large that
it may accommodate two sets of pumps.

Such wells are usually 12 to 14 feet in diameter.

To sink such a well in the ordinary way is a very long and costly undertaking,

especially if soft strata are met with, where lining becomes necessary. On the

completion of the well it may be necessary to drive adits to increase the water-

Asupply.  simple bore-hole is made very cheaply and very expeditiously. Four

30-inch bore-holes can be put down in a very small fraction of the time required

to sink a 12-foot well.

    Instead of making a large well, the author puts down four bore-holes to ac-

--commodate the pumps for duplicate pumping engines a pair of pumps to each

engine. The bore-holes being completed, the pumps are lowered into them and

coupled-up to the permanent engines. Immediately that is done the water found

in the bore-holes can be pumped and supplied to the town. Should it be insufficient,

then a small well would be sunk in the dry to the bottom of the bore-hole pumps.

The water being kept down by the pumps, the bore-holes at the level of the pumps

would he connected to the centre well, and adits driven to collect more water.

Should the bore-holes yield sufhcient water, it would not be necessary to sink

the well. It would be absurd to advocate any particular system of well-sinking

as being universally applicable ; this system, however, of making wells offera

advantages under favourable conditions, but the advisability of its adoption in

any particular case must be a matter of judgment with the engineer planning th&

work.

The bore-holes at Netherley, two in number, are sunk in Red Sandstone rock,,

and are placed 20 feet apart, each bored to a diameter of 30 inches for a depth of

200 feet, and to a reduced diameter of 18 inches for a further depth of 200 feet and

300 feet respectively, thus making the first hole 400 feet deep, and the second one

500 feet deep. On the completion of the boring the water stood 70 to 80 feet from

the surface of the ground, when the quantity pumped by the old engine on the

same site was 1;^ million gallons per day. The main pumps were then lowered intO'
the bore-holes, each pump extending to the bottom of the large part of the hole,

200 feet from the ground-level. In that position the pumps were suspended from

a cast-iron bed-plate supported on a concrete foundation formed round the top of

the holes, a block of oak being inserted between the head of the pump and the

bed-plate. In this suspended position the pumps work without the slightest

unsteadiness.

     The engines were made for the purpose of pumping 2^ million gallons per day,
but it was found that, working up to their full capacity of 2| million gallons, the
full yield of the bore-holes was not reached. On starting the new pumps it was
found that when pumping 2| million gallons per day the water-level was lowered

to 100 feet from the surface of the ground.

   --II. The Application of the Puinping Poiver. The motive power consists of a

230 horse-power compound surface-condensing engine, employed to pump from

the bore-holes into a masonry tank by the engine foundations, from which tank the
water is forced by the same engine to a reservoir at an elevation of 260 feet. The
engine is made to work the force-pump by means of a tail rod from the low-pressure
cylinder, the bore-hole pumps being worked by means of rocking levers actuated

by a connecting-rod from the crosshead of the engine. There is no flywheel or

rotary motion, but a very simple expedient is resorted to to enable the engine to

work expansively. This steam distribution is effected by giving a peculiar bell
crank form to the levers which convey motion to the well pumps. The etlect of
this mode of coupling the pump piston or plunger to the engine piston is to make

the pump-resistance diagram so nearly approach the shape of the combined engine

diagram that the weight of the moving parts of the engine is of itself, by its

--inertia, sufficient to equate the two diagrams.
     Steam Distribution. The engine is of the receiver type, having separate

expansion valves on both high- and low-pressure cylinders, adjustable by hand

whilst the engine is in motion.

   A careful trial of the engine has been made, and as it is provided with a surface-

condenser, it was quite easy to ascertain the exact quantity of steam used by the

engine by measuring the air-pump discharge, and adding that discharged from the

steam-jackets.

The efficiencies are as follow:

1. Engine efficiency: the proportion which the area of the actual indicator-

diagrams bears to the area of the theoretical diagram for the steam admitted to the

engine = '644.

    2. Mechanical efficiency, or the portion of the indicated power utilised by the
pumps = 87 per cent.

     3. Thermal efficiency, or the portion of the energy due to the fall in temperature
of the steam which has been utilised by the engine = ·433.

     Units of work per unit of heat = 110 8.

with steam at boiler pressure.

        2. On the Strength and Plastic Extensibility of Iron and Steel.
                 By Professor T. Claxton Fidler, M.Inst.C.E.

     1. For several reasons the stress-strain diagram, as autographically drown in
connection with the testing cf a ductile material, does not suffice to indicate any
definite relation between tensile stress and plastic strain. The stretching effect of
the load is commonly measured before it is fully developed ; the ordinates of the
diagram represent stress per unit of original area, but cannot represent the actual
unit stress, which varies in different parts of the bar ; and, lastly, the elongation
measured by the diagram is the elongation of the whole bar, and is the sum of the
component elements of elongation, which vary still more widely in different parts of

the bar.

     2. Analysing the total elongation, and plotting as co-ordinates the actual in-
tensity of stress in any short segment or element of the bar, and the actual elonga-
tion in the same element under a long-continued load, the curve takes a very

different form, and is probably already familiar to those who have taken a special

interest in the subject.

     3. So far as the author's direct experiments have gone, the curve so traced
appears to be almost identical for all parts of a fairly homogeneous bar, indi-
cating that the plastic extensibility, or the actual extension under any given
stress, is nearly the same in all segments of the bar's length, even when the ultimate
elongation varies, as it often does, between 12 per cent, and 120 per cent, in the

different segments.

     4. Volumetric measurements of the successive segments indicate that there is
no sensible telescopic shear, or internal flow of material from one segment to another
(except at one point, which need not be here noticed), and justify the general
application of the assumption of unchanging volume.

    5. Probably, therefore, the curve may be taken to represent the variable length

X assumed by each component internal element under the long-continued stress y,
as well as the variable length of any cylindrical segment under the same stress, the
original length of the element or segment being denoted by L.

     6. It may st first sight be supposed that a bar of uniform plastic extensibility
ought to draw out uniformly over its whole length ; but when the curve is con-

sidered along with the mechanical conditions affecting the question, they seem
sufficient to explain the observed behaviour of the bar. Beyond a certain critical
point a uniform extension is almost impossible, just as the uniform compression of
a long and slender strut is impossible. The formation of a short narrow neck in

--some part of the tin-bar is inevitable like the buckling of the strut.

     7. To ilhistr.te these points and some others the curve, as approximately
determined for a bar of mild steel, was shown in the diagrams exhibited, and its
regularity suggests the existence of a definite law of extension. As the length x
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                  751

increases, the resistance of tlie material increases continuously up to the point of
fracture. Nevertheless, it is shown that, as .v increases, the relations between the
stretching force and the resistance pass from a condition of stable, through indif-
ferent, to unstable equilibrium. The law of plastic extension, y = ^(.i), as defined
by the curve, fixes mathematically the occurrence of the ' plastic limit ; ' and it fixes
also the ' breaking weight per square inch of original area,' which can have only one
value, and is easily found by graphic construction. The breaking weight of the tie-

bar as thus defined depends upon the plastic extensibility, in much the same way

that the breaking weight of a strut depends upon the elastic modulus.
     8. Examining next the possibilities of deformation in a bar of uniform or

nearly uniform extensibility, it may be seen that, as the plastic limit is approached,

the slightest irregularity in section or in extensibility tends to precipitate tb(} foi'-
mation of a contracted region, and ensures that beyond that limit the further
extension of the bar and the further contraction of area will be confined to the

same region. For stresses below the plastic limit the probabilities of deformation

mav be examined by considering the relative time-rates of extension at two elements
which may have been unequally stretched, and at first the tendency is theoretically

in favour of preserving the cylindrical form of the bar. But beyond the plastic limit
these conditions are reversed, and the tendencies are all in favour of precipitating
the most rapid contraction of area at the point where any contraction already
exists, and thus to pinch in still further the region where any contraction of form
has begun to show itself.

    The observed phenomena agree very well with these deductions, and may be

rationally attributed to the operation of the mechanical conditions named.
     9. Going back to the yield-point, the sudden elongation which here takes place

appears to be something difl'erent from plastic extension. Examined analytically,
the process is found to take place at somewhat different stresses in the different
segments, while in any one short element or segment it seems to be instantaneous.
If the yield is arrested midway and the bar examined, it is sometimes found that
the elongation has been quite completed in some segments, and not even commenced
in others. This irregularity is greater than anything met with in connection with
plastic extension, and may account for the variations of form observed in auto-

graphic diagrams at this point. When rhe process has taken place throughout, it

constitutes an elongation which is almost uniform tbroughout the bar, and after

the yield the segments fall into line and exhibit a nearly identical curve. As
regards the slight curvature below the yield-point, it may be doubtful whether this
indicates the commencement of yield in some short elements, or the commence-
ment of a plastic extension in the course of which the vdeld occurs as a separate

incident,

     10. The author recognises the insufficient nature of his experimental data, and
the need for further study and more refined measurements of the true curve of
plastic extension ; but judging from the results obtained, some formulfe ai-e suggested
as representing the probable law of plastic extension for such a ductile material.

     11. In the paper some further experiments are described which were made with
the object of measuring the extensions on a larger scale, and of testing some of

the propositions before referred to.

3. On Tunnel Construction by means of Shield and Compressed Air, ivith
    special Reference to the Tunnel under the Thames at Blackivall. By

    Maurice Fitzmaurice.

     Since 1892, when Mr. George F. Deacon read a paper before the British Asso-
ciation on the construction by means of shield and compressed air of the Vyrnwy

Aqueduct Tunnel under the Mersey, other and larger tunnels have been constructed

and are now in course of construction in this country by the same methods.

Three tunnels hare been thus completed under the Clyde just below Glasgow,

and tunnels at several points in Glasgow are being made in connection with the

AGlasgow District Subway.  tunnel is also being constructed in Edinburgh by
--752 REPORT 1894.

 the same means. In all these tunnels compressed air has been used in conjunction
 with shields almost continuously, as the amount of water met with has been large,
 and it has been necessary in most cases to avoid all subsidence of the ground above
 as much as possible.

      The tunnel under the Thames at Blackwall which is being built for the London
 County Council under the direction of their chief engineer, Mr. A. R. Binnie, has
 now been under construction for more than two years, and although the greatest

 difficulties have probably yet to come, still an account of the present state of the
 work and the difficulties met with up to date will, it is hoped, not be without

 interest.

      Before dealing with the Blackwall Tunnel the author made a few remarks on
 previous tunnels constructed by one or both of the methods under consideration.

      The tunnel under the Thames between Wapping and Rotherhithe, constructed
 by Brunei between the years 1825 and 1842, was the first tunnel constructed by
 means of a shield, and its history is so well known that it will not be necessary to
refer further to it. It may be noticed, however, that in a patent of Brunei's taken
out in 1818 he had at that time conceived the idea of a tunnel made of cast iron
 with an inside brick lining, and constructed by means of a shield which had a
tail lapping over the completed portion of the tunnel and shoved forward by means

of hydraulic rams.
      Cochrane took out a patent for using compressed air in the construction of

shafts and tunnels in 1833, but it was not used for the former until 1839, and was
not used in any tunnel before 1872 or 1873.

      The use of compressed air in conjunction with a shield, and the construction of
the tunnel itself with cast-iron rings, although the latter may not be so important
in some cases, may be considered the key to tunnelling in loose or soft ground filled
with water.

      The question of settlement, especially in towns, is a very important one.

When pumping has to be done the water is naturally drawn down in the adjacent

strata, and in addition quantities of sand often come with the water, and settle-

ment occurs from the first or from both of these causes. When compressed air is

used no pumping, of course, is necessary, and tlierefr)re there can be no settlement
imder that head. Probably the most fruitful cause of settlement in ordinary
tunnels iscaui^ed by the fact that more ground is taken out than the tunnel actually
fills, and although the utmost care is taken in supporting the ground and packing

all cavities, a certain amount of settlement invariably occurs. With a shield the

excavation is reduced to almost the net section of the tunnel, and therefore no

settlement can take place to any appreciable extent. As regards safety in working,
it is evident that when only the face of the excavation is open, and that, perhaps,
only in small areas, and the water is kept b.ack by compressed air, the maximum
of safety is assured. The great advantages of constructing the tunnel of cast-iron
segments are, that it is much quicker to build than anything else, and that it has

its full strength as soon as it is built ; and this latter is a very important matter in
soft ground, which exerts a heavj' pressure on the tunnel.

     The Tower Subway, 7 ft. 1^ in. in external diameter, constructed by Mr. Peter
Barlow in 1869, is interesting as being the fiist tunnel in which a shield shoved
forward as one structure was used, and for the construction of which cast iron was
adopted. It was driven through London clay, no water had to be dealt with, and
no ditficulties were encountered. In 1870 an experimental length of tunnel 8 ft.

in external diameter was driven under Broadway, New York City, by means of a

shield, to demonstrate the practicability of constructing tunnels by this method
without injuring buildings by settlement. Between 1870 and 1874 tunnels of 6 ft.
diameter were driven by the same means under the streets of Cincinnati for drainage
purposes, and for 1^ mile under Lake Erie for the supplv of water to Cleveland,

Ohio.

     The first large tunnel completed by means of shields and compressed air was
the St. Clair Tunnel, finished in 1890. It was constructed with cast-iron segments
of an outside diameter of 21 ft., and compressed air up to a pressure of 32 lb. was

used. This tunnel was principally through soft clay, and the maximum progress
in one month at one face was 382 ft.

     About the same time Mr. J. H. Greathead completed the City and South
London Railway in London. It consists of two tunnels, made of cast-iron seg-

ments, 10 ft. 6 in. in diameter each, and 3 miles long. Compressed air was only

necessary for short distances at three points, as it was principally driven through
London clay.

     Previous to the construction of the St. Clair Tunnel compressed air had been
used in the Hudson Tunnel, which still remains unfinished owing to financial
difficulties. The greater portion of its length is constructed of cast-iron rings of

                                                                  ^

19 ft. 8 in. diameter.

     In 1891 Messrs. Pearson and Son's tender for the construction of the Blackwall
Tunnel, amounting to 871,000/., was accepted by the Council, and the work was

commenced in 1892. Mr. D. Hay and the author were appointed as resident
engineers under Mr. A. R. Binnie, and Mr. E. W. Moir took charge of the works

for the contractors.

    The Blackwall Tunnel is much larger than any tunnel yet constructed by the
methods adopted. The outside diameter of the St. Clair Tunnel, which is the

largest one at present, is 21 ft., while that at Blackwall is 27 ft. in external
diameter.

The tunnel is level under the river, and the gradient on the north side is 1 in

34, and on the south side 1 in 36. There are four vertical shafts, two on each side

of the river, and varying in depth from 75 ft. to 100 ft. below ground level. Each

shaft is a wrought-iron caisson of 58 ft. external diameter at the bottom, and 48 ft.

internal diameter throughout, and lined with brickwork. Each caisson consists of

two wrought-iron skins, 5 ft. apart, braced together, and terminating in a cutting-

edge. Two circular holes, which are temporarily plugged while sinking, are left in

each caisson to give way for tlie tunnel through the shaft, and provision is made

for an airtight floor above the level of the tunnel when necessary. The space

between the two skins is filled with concrete. Two caissons have been sunk, and

the two others are in course of being sunk.

The tunnel is constructed of cast-iron rings 2 ft. 6 in. long, and each ring

consists of fourteen segments and a key-piece. The thickness of metal is 2 in.
and each segment has flanges 12 in. deep, and both longitudinal and circum-

ferential joints are planed.

The shield used for the construction of the tunnel is 19 ft. 6 in. long, and

is 27 ft. 8 in. in external diameter. The outer shell consists of four ^-in.

steel plates. The shield is divided into a front and back portion by two vertical

diaphragms at right angles to its axis. It is thus possible, when necessary, to

have a higher air pressure in the working face of the shield than in the completed

portion of the tunnel. The space between these two diaphragms forms an air-lock,

both diaphragms, of course, being provided with doors, by which access to the

working face is obtained. At the back of this air-lock the shield consists only of

the outer shell, which always laps over and outside at least one completed ring of

the tunnel, and inside of which all the rings are built. The space of 4 in.

left outside the rings when the shield is shoved forward is tilled with grout,

forced in by air pressure through screwed holes made in each segment for the

purpose. Everything is, therefore, quite solid at the back of the cast-iron lining.

At the air-lock and in front of it there is an inner shell, connected stiffly to the

outer shell by circular girders and in other ways, and both joining together at the

cutting-edge. The working face is divided into four horizontal floors and twelve

workinfr chambers by vertical and horizontal diaphragms in the Une of the axis of

1894.                                                                   3c

Athe shield.    hanging iron screen in each compartment ahout 6 ft. back from

the cutting-edge forms a safety chamber at its back, where men could stand with

their heads abore water in case of a rush of water in the face due to air blowing

out suddenly, or from other causes. Provision is made for using iron poling boards

at the face, shoved forward by jacks, when in ballast, if necessary. The shield, which

weighs about 250 tons, is shoved forward by twenty-eight hydraulic jacks fixed at

the back and butting against the cast-iron lining, and able to exert a total pressure

of over 3,000 tons.

At the present time the portion of the tunnel between shafts No. 4 and No. .3

has been constructed. The shield was started from No. 4 shaft in June 1893,

the first permanent ring being erected on June 0. When first starting the face

was nearly all clay, there being a little ballast at top and a little tine sand at the

bottom. It was therefore decided to go on without compressed air for some time,

and in three months seventy-seven rings, being equivalent to a length of 192 lineal

feet, were erected. This length was done with practically no timbering, except in

Athe top ballast for a short length, in which a good deal of water was met.  little

previous to this time the cutting-edge at the bottom of the shield got bent by

shoving the shield against a layer of rock which was met in the clay, and it was
found now to have got much worse. It was therefore considered better to drive

a timbered bottom heading in front of the shield, and put in a concrete foundation

on which the shield could be shoved forward to the next shaft. This was done

for the bottom 6 ft. of the shield, all the excavation above this level being done

without timbering. In this way by the middle of December, six months after

starting, 191 rings, equivalent to 477 lineal feet, had been erected.

    As the tunnel was going down a gradient of 1 in 3G, and the top of the sand

remained nearly level, the latter was now up to the middle of the shield, and was
carrying a great deal of water. On December 16 there was a rush of water and

sand, which filled the heading with sand, and the water rose 15 ft. in the tunnel

at the shield.

    As the shield was now close to No. 3 shaft, which was not yet sunk to its full
depth, it was considered safer not to continue the tunnel until the shaft was sunk,

and in the meantime to mal<e preparations for using compressed air when work

Awas again started.  concrete bulkhead was therefore built across the tunnel, with

air-locks in it, a little back from the shield, and when tlie shaft had been sunk to

its full depth, work was recommenced in the tunnel on March 23, under air pressure

of about 15 lb. to the square inch.

    No further trouble from water was then experienced, and by going on in the
same way as above described with a bottom heading, the shield was got into No. 3

sh alt in May. It is now being strengthened and repaired there, preparatory to

starting under the river from No. 3 to No. 2 shaft.

In the deepest portion of the river, where the top of the tunnel comes within

7 ft. of the river bed, which is all gravel at this point, it is proposed to lay a
bed of clay 10 ft. thick in the bottom of the river, to prevent the compressed air
blowing out ; and with this precaution it is hoped that no difficulty will be met
with in this portion of the work which cannot be overcome by the experience

already gained in the portion between shafts No. 3 and No. 4.

   2. On the most Economical Temperat^ire for Steam-engine Cylinders ; or,
                Hot V. Cold Walls. By Brvan Donkin, M.Inst.C.E.

        The author calls attention to the important question of the most suitable tem-

   perature of cylinder walls to obtain the maximum economy by reducing condeusa-

   tion in steam cylinders to a minimum. To diminish condensation his experiments

   prove that it is essential to reduce the difference of temperature between the

   incoming steam and the cylinder walls. In most cases the cylinder walls are much

   colder than the steam, and often one-half the weight of steam is condensed during

   admission. Many experiments show that the nearer the temperature of the cylinder

   wall is to that of the entering steam the greater is the economy. With walls 40^^

   to 60° Fahr. colder than the steam, as is olten the case, the consumption is greatly

   increased, owing to the large amount of condensation. On the other hand, the

   cylinder metal can be made too hot and heat wasted at exhaust. This has als(>
   been experimentally proved by the author. The best results in steam economy

   have been obtained when the temperature of the internal surfaces is a little higher

   than that of the entering steam.

   Cylinder walls can be heated in various ways. The most usual is to raise their

   temperature and that of the covers, by means of boiler steam introduced into the

   jacket spaces. Another method, and one used a good deal on the Continent, is to

   work with superheated steam. This steam has been employed in some cases with

   advantage in the jackets as well as in the cylinders. Smoke jackets have generally

   proved a failure. When the jacket is connected to a condenser having a good

   vacuum, economy of steam is also obtained, but not so much as with steam in the
   jackets. To secure the maximum economy also, it is important not only to

   diminish the volume of the clearance spaces, but especially to reduce as much as
   possible the area of the clearance boundary surfaces. In this way the weight of
   iron heated and cooled per stroke so many degrees can be materially diminished.

   The character of the internal surfaces, whether rough from the sand or turned,

   and their position, horizontal or vertical, have also some influence on the trans-

   mission of heat and condensation of steam, as verified by recent trials.

   Experiments have also shown that the cylinder wall in any working steam

   engine is divided thermally into two parts ; the outer portion remains at a constant

   temperature, and the inner or periodic portion is heated with each steam, and

   cooled with each exhaust stroke. The relative proportion of these two parts, or

   the depth to which the heat penetrates into the metal, depends largely upon the

   speed of the engine, and on the temperature of the cylinder relatively to that of

   the entering steam. In a non-jacketed engine, with one-inch cylinder walls,

   working at thirty-five revolutions per minute, the depth to which the heat pene-

   trates and fluctuates per stroke is at least about eight to nine millimetres from the

   internal surface. The depth of heat-penetration for the same speed is much less

   with hot  than with cold  Avails ;  a less weight  of  metal is heated  per  stroke                            and
                                                                                                               ;

   condensation is found to be much reduced.

   The author gives some of the results of eighty experiments on a small ver-

   tical engine, with cylinder 6 in. diameter and 8 in. stroke, made expressly for

   experimental research. The details are to be published in ' Proceedings of the

   Institution of Mechanical Engineers.' The engine was worked with very diHerent

   temperatures of walls, and many tests were made, condensing and non-condensing,

   jacketed and non-jacketed, single and double acting, at ditiereut expansions, and

   with both saturated and superheated steam in the cylinder and jackets. Care was

   taken in these experiments only to vary one set of conditions at a time. Results

   of two experiments are added, one with hot and the other with cold walls, or

   one with steam and the other with air in the jackets. Both tests were made con-

   densing, double-acting, with 50 lb. steam pressure, ^^ cut-off, and at a speed of
   220 revolutions per minute. The walls were some iiO° Fahr. hotter with than

   without steam in the jackets ; the steam consumption per I.H.P. per hour was

   reduced from 41 j lb. to 28^ lb., or about 31 per cent. ; the thermal efficiency was

one-half. The percentage of steam present in the mixture during expansion was

also increased bj' about 50 per cent.
     Throughout these experiments an increase of economy with the hotter walls

was always verified ; the thermal efficiency was higher, the initial condensation
less, and the percentage of steam present during expansion always increased.

     The tests on this engine point to the practical conclusion that the range of
steam temperature in the cylinder per stroke has much less efi'ect on the steam
consumption than the temperature of the walls.

  --The paper may he shortly summarised thus : The most uneconomical results-

were always obtained with the cylinder walls colder than the entering steam.
Under these conditions considerable initial condensation was produced, drops of all

sizes up to 3 mm. diameter being formed and running down the cold surfaces.
The heat also penetrated into the colder walls to a considerable depth, a certain

quantity being given up by the steam at every stroke, to raise the temperature of
the internal surfaces alter exposure to the condenser temperature. Both at cut-off
and release there was a great deal of water in the cylinder compared with the

weight of steam present. On the other hand, the most economical results wer©
always obtained when the cylinder walls were at about the same temperature as
that of the entering steam. Under these conditions the rate of initial condensa-
tion was very much lower, and the drops of water formed much smaller in size.
The heat penetration into the walls was also mucbless, a smaller amount of steam

sufficing to heat the internal surfaces after being cooled by the condenser. The-
percentage of steam present in the mixture, at cut-off and release, was also very
much increased.

     If engineers and others using steam engines wish to work economically and
with smaller boilers, they must arrange to keep their cylinders and covers as hot as
the steam entering the cylinder ; otherwise the cylinder becomes unintentionally-
an efficient condenser, with a large area of cooling surface.

      Properly applied steam jackets are economical, because they raise the tem-

perature of the walls touched by the steam. Those who cannot steam-jacket

the whole cylinder should at least jacket the two covers, which are the most
important surfaces.

      Well-arranged jackets with proper-sized pipes for entering steam and exit water,
without places for air to collect, are an excellent investment, and pay a good
interest on the small additional cost.

is equipped witb high-tension continuous-current dynamos driven by means of belts

from triple-expansion vertical engines                                                                                                                                                                            it is placed 1,500 yards away from the area

of lighting. The current is distributed by means of a network, which is fed by

motor generators transforming from 1,000 to 105 volts. These motor gene-

rators are started, stopped, and regulated from a central switch station placed in

the area. The main feature of the system is the complete control of the motor

generators from the switch station ; and the number connected on to the network

being varied to suit the load, it is possible to always work the transformers at a high

Aefficiency.  small battery situated at the switch station is used to supply the

small day and night loads, thus enabling the Central Station to bo entirely shut

down for a great portion of the twenty-four hours.

The figures for 1893 show that the total efficiency of the system was GI-62 per

cent., and the efficiency of the motor generators was 74-44 per cent., including

losses in mains and resistances. This is not so high as it will be in the future,

when the lamps are more evenly distributed over the area. The battery efficiency
was 5064 per cent. The actual coal used throughout the year works out to
6-83 lb., or -718 penny per unit sold, which is a very good result, as only slightly
over 100,000 Board of Trade units were metered. The oil, waste, water, anil

general engine-room stores tvork out to -0657 penny per unit metered. The total
number of lamps installed at the beginning of the year was 4,041, which increased
to 7,01 2 by the end of the year. As the great proportion of supply is taken up by

colleges, the term-time is the only part of the year when anything like a load can
be obtained, and the load factor is only 631 per cent.

The revenue during the year under notice was 10s. lid. per 35-watt lamp

installed.

                             4. On a Sjxcial Chr'onoc/raph.
              By Henry Lea, M.Inst.C.E., and Robert Bragge.

     In his capacity as electric inspector for the city of Birmingham the duly ot
one of the writers is to test the accuracy of the electric meters used in that city.
The test involves an accurate measurement on the one hand of the current of
electricity passing through the meter, and on the other band of the period of time
during which the current of electricity efl'ects a certain number of revolutions of
the meter armature.

     For the electrical measurements he selected a Crompton potentiometer, but
as his chronograph was not accurate enough he drew up a specification upon
which the English Watch Company built the chronograph exhibited to the meeting.
The ideal chronograph is one with a perfectly divided dial, an absolute prompt
start, a definite stop at zero, and a continuous or running motion of the hand.

     The test-room chronograph under notice is not intended for use as a watch ; it
is purely and simply a micrometer applied to time, and therefore it has only two

--3)ointers one from the centre, giving seconds and their fractions, the other placed

halfway between the centre and circumference, showing minutes up to sixty. The
dial of aluminium, being engine divided, is mechanically perfect; and being of

large size, 2j inches of sight, the divisions of ten to the second are clearly

defined.

     The prompt, absolute start is obtained by dispensing with all intermediate gear-
ing and relying on the main train of wheels impelled by the ordinary mainspring.
The starting lever not only releases the balance-wheel, but at the same time by
the momentary contact of a light spring blade impels the wheel in the required

direction.

     The absolute stop at the end of an observation is obtained by the frictional
·contact of the aforesaid spring blade with the edge of the balance-wheel.

     The absolute stop at zero is obtained by fixing upon the axis of the seconds
"wheel a collet carrying a blade. Upon the top of the movement there is a lever,
·which, during the period of an observation, is held back ; but when the observa-
tion is concluded it is set free by a push of the button, and falls to a point where
it crosses the path of the blade already referred to, and stopping the wheels brings
about the absolute stop we require.

     The last thing requisite is for the seconds hand to have a continuous run.
Everything tried up to the present has had a tendency to accelerate its rate, and
is therefore inadmissible. The lever escapement has been adhered to, and by
using hard stone jewellings, and by observing great accuracy in the angles of the

--pallets, the makers are enabled to double the ordinary number of beats 36,000

5. On a Direct Reading Forin of Platinum Thermometer.
                      By G. M. Clark, B.A.

The author described the pyrometer of Callendar and Griffiths. In this instru-

ment the leads to the platinum coil are so arranged that only a single observation

is necessary to determine its resistance. Further, by constructing the galvano-

meter so that its deflections are independent of the E.M.F. of the battery, the

same increase of resistance of the coil will always give the same deflection on the

Apcale.  wide range of temperature as well as an open scale is secured by the

galvanometer being brought back to zero every hundred degrees. It is also pomted

out that the ' fixed points' of these thermometers are not liable to variation.

As reliable experiments with the air thermometer above 700° C. have not yet

been carried out, the author suggested the adoption of a platinum thermometer

with fixed coefficients as a standard.

                By H. F. W. BuRSTALL, M.A., A.M.Inst.C.E.

     The treatment adopted in this paper has been to consider the temperature
entropy diagrams, from the engineer's point of view, and as far as possible graphical
methods are alone employed.

     The reason of the great value of the diagrams lies in the fact that an area
represents the heat required to effect the change denoted by the contour of the area ;
and when the actual expansion of the steam is plotted on the heat diagram it is
easy to see by inspection where the losses of heat have occurred.

     The ordinates of the curves are the absolute temperature and the entropy or

heat weight.

     The curves denoting the heat required to form a given mixture of steam and
water can be drawn once for all ; after that very simple arithmetic is all that is
required to trace the expansion curve for any engine on the heat diagram.

     The changes in the pressure and dryness of steam confined in a constant volume
are shown by means of a model in space, in which the vertical distances represent
the volume of steam, and the horizontal plane a temperature entropy diagram.

On cutting the surface formed by a plane parallel to the horizontal plane we have

a curve which gives the constant volume curves, and the construction follows at
once from the model.

      The paper was illustrated b}' diagrams from several types of steam engines, both
compound and triple expansion, and the diagram for a gas engine was also shown.

                         By James Swinburne, M.Inst.C.E.

      Governors are generally considered as complete mechanisms without reference
to the engines governed. Hunting, however, depends, not only on the governor,

                          ' Published in full in Engineering, August 17, 1894.

Abut also on the inertia of the fly-wheel and the load on the engine.  Watt

governor acting directly on the throttle or expansion valve does not hunt if designed

for stability, but does not give the same speed at heavy as at light loads. If made

isochronous it has either a dash-pot or a relay. In either case the action of the

governor is not instantaneous, and a time-lag is introduced. This causes hunting,

especially if the load is light and the fly-wheel heavy or fast-running. If the iso-

chronous governor works a slow-acting relay the hunting may be so serious that

the steam supply alternates between complete cut-off and full supply. The remedy

is to use either an isochronous governor with no relay, so that the engine gets either

full steam or none, or to use a stable governor acting direct with a supplementary

relay gear to secure the same speed at full and light loads. The first method is

not employed in large slow-running engines, as the fly-wheel would have to be

enormous. The second is utilised in the Knowles supplementary governor, but a

second governor is unnecessary, as one can fill both functions.

4. On Engineering Laboratory Instruments and their Calibration. By

      David S. Capper, M.A., Professor of Mechanical Engineering, King's
       College, London.

    The reliance to be placed upon observations made with measuring instruments
evidently depends primarily upon the accuracy with which those instruments
record. Neglect of this fundamental truth often leads to inaccurate and erroneous
deductions from experiments which are themselves of the highest scientific value
not infrequently the whole value of observations may be destroyed by insufficient
care in the calibration of the instruments used. The subject is therefore one of
some importance. The author describes the chief sources of error in some of the
most common engineering investigations, and their probable value, and points out
some of the possible methods of correction where such exist. For example, in
engine trials there are many possible sources of error. Most of these may be reduced
in percentage value by continuing the trial for a sufficient period. But this is not the
case with errors which may occur in the indicators, gauges, or spring balances used

in the determination of power. In these, unless properly calibrated before trial,

very serious errors may be introduced, amounting in some cases to 5 and 6 per

cent, of the total power indicated. It is therefore absurd, even if proper precau-
tions have been taken, to rely upon horse-power measurements to two places of

decimals.

      Similarly with regard to tension and compression experiments with standard
10-inch bars. Here calibration of the testing machine is extremely difficult, and
can in general only be carried out over a small portion of the range of the experi-
ments. Deductions have therefore to be made from the less to the greater, with

the result that small errors in the calibration will tend to be magnified. Vertical

testing machines have fewer sources of error, and can be calibrated with more
certainty, than horizontal machines. Extensometers are, however, much more
easily applied to a horizontal bar than a vertical, and variable jockey weights,
which are requisite if the same accuracy is to be maintained at low loads as at
high, are also more readily adapted to horizontal machines.

     Extensometers can be made and calibrated well up to the accuracy of the
testing machine. With standard bars and a measuring instrument true to the ten-
thousandth of an inch, the modulus can be relied upon to the second significant
figure. It is doubtful if more can be obtained without very special construction
 and calibration of the testing machine.

      The difficulty in bending experiments, again, lies in the accurate application of
load. Unless the beams are very short or of unmanageable cross-sections, the
load measurement must be very delicate if readings approaching the accuracy of
 those in tension are to be obtained. It is possible that some of the discrepancies
in published beam experiments may be due to this cause.

      The paper deals shortly with other cases where calibration is specially needed,
 to -which the limits of this abstract do not permit a more extensive allusion.

5. On Lighthouse Apparatus and Lighthouse Administration in 1894.

     The writer referred to the principles that govern the establishment of modern
lights, and described the chief forms of apparatus now best available for the optical

engineer, e.g., the single Hashing or the group-flashing holophotal revolving ; the

fixed and occulting ; the lenticular revolving, having refracting centres alone,

He compared the dimensions or ' orders ' of various apparatus, and the radiants

of gas, oil, and electricity, and discussed the question oifog in relation to these.

    He called attention to the need of good ship-lights on the dioptric system,

having equality of power in the beam.

    He suggested certain reforms in lighthouse administration and in lighthouse

statistics.

 6. On Spring Spokes for Bicycles. By Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S.

     The author described a construction of spring-spoked wheels for bicycles in
·which both lateral and rotational yielding are so moderate in amount as to
occasion no inconvenience. Each spoke consists essentially of a small coil spring,
weighing half an ounce, attached to a light spoke wire, the connections of the ends
of the spoke to hub and rim, as well as the connection between spring and wire,
being of the hook-and-eye kind. The attachment to the rim is made, not at the
centre of the rim, but at its edges, semicircular notches being cut, into which the
spokes are hooked, and the spokes attached to either edge of the rim are attached
to the opposite flange of the hub, so as to cross the plane of the wheel. The
spokes of the driving-wheel are not exactly radial, but slope a little backwards

--and forwards alternately an arrangement which materially diminishes rotational

yielding, while the crossing above described diminishes lateral yielding.
      It has generally been maintained that, while up-and-down elasticity is useful

for relieving jolts, lateral and rotational yielding are evils to be avoided. The
author differs from this view, and maintains that both lateral and rotational
yielding, of the elastic kind, when kept within proper limits of magnitude, are
beneficial both as regards comfort and speed.

     When one of the wheels of a bicycle encounters an obstacle (such as rough

roads abound with), the collision produces an impulsive reaction on the wheel, aa
if the obstacle struck the wheel. Sometimes the direction of the blow lies in the

plane of the wheel, but in many cases the wheel is not only checked and lifted, but
at the same time driven to one side. In order to cushion the lateral component of
the blow there must be lateral yielding. Accordingly, in running over patches of
stones, which jerk the ground-point of a wheel from side to side, the usual jarring

of the hands and disturbance of the steering are noticeably absent in bicycles with

spring spokes.

     As regards a blow delivered in the plane of the wheel, the impulse may be
resolved into a radial and a tangential component. The radial component is

cushioned by the shortening of the spokes in the neighbourhood of the point of
impact, and the lengthening of the diametrically opposite spokes.

      The tangential component is equivalent to an equal and parallel impulse on the
rim in a line passing through the centre, combined with a torque. The torque,
from the symmetry of its action round the axle of the wheel, produces no jar ; but
the impulse in a line through the centre tends to drive the rim backwards and
slightly downwards, with respect to the axle. It is cushioned by the elastic
shortening and lengthening of spokes which are nearly horizontal.

     The elastic yielding of a pneumatic tyre is mainly in the radial direction, and
is practically nil in the tangential direction. Its lateral yielding is very much less
than that aflbrded by spring spokes.

      Next, as regards rotational yielding of the driving-wheel, the propelling force
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  761

applied by the rider to the pedals is given out at the ground-point of the wheel in
the shape of back-pressure of the wheel against the ground. The more rigid and
unyielding the connection between these two parts of the mechanism is, the greater
will be the tendency to jarring of the feet by inequalities of the ground. Even on
smooth ground there is a jerk at the beginning of each stroke, in the case of an
unyielding wheel, which tends to fatigue the knee. The difference between the
energy given to the springs and the energy which they return is quite trifling in
comparison with the saving of energy which results from the easing-off of concus-
sions. Moreover, the energy stored in the springs is useful in carrying the wheel
past the dead-points, a small pressure unconsciously exerted on the pedals being
sufficient to retain the energy till it is wanted.

    An indirect benefit from lateral yielding is the diminution of side-slip. Side-

slip will begin as soon as the lateral force called out between the wheel and the
road at the ground-point exceeds a certain limiting amount. Lateral yielding

eases off the suddenness of lateral impulses, thus keeping down the maximum

amount of lateral force; and this is precisely what is required for preventing

side-slip.

     In some of the driving-wheels which the author has constructed the hub is
allowed to project much farther on the side remote from the driving-chain than on
the side next the chain, in order to permit the combination of a wide hub with a
narrow width between the pedals. AVeaker springs are used on the projecting
side than on the other side. This unsymmetrical arrangement is not found to
interfere with the ease of steering:.

                     Section H.--ANTHROPOLOGY.

President of the Section-- Sir W. H. Flower, K.O.B., LL.D., Sc.D., F.li.S.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST 9.

    The President delivered the following Address :

It is not usual for the President of a Section of this Association to think it necessary
to give any explanation of the nature of the subjects brought under its cognisance,

or to emphasise their importance among other branches of study ; but so general
is the ignorance, or at all events vagueness of information, among otherwise well-

instructed persons, that I will ask your permission to devote the short time accorded

to me before the actual work of the Section begins to giving some account of the

history and present position of the study of Anthropology in this country, and
especially to indicate what this Association has done in the past, and is still doing,
to promote it.

    It is only ten years since the Section in which we are now taking part acquired
a definite and assured position in the organisation of the Association. The
subject, of course, existed long before that time, and was also recognised by

the Association, though with singular vicissitudes of fortune and position. It

Dfirst appeared officially in 1846, when the ' Ethnological sub-Section of Section

(then called 'Zoology and Botany') was constituted. This lasted till 1851,
when Geography parted company from Geology, with which it had been previously
· associated in Section C, and became Section E, under the title of ' Geography and

DEthnology.' In 186G Section changed its name to ' Biology,' with Physiology

and Anthropology (the first occurrence of this word in our official proceedings) as
separate ' Departments ; ' but the latter does not seem to have regained its definite
footing as a branch of Biological Science until three years later (1869), when
Section E, dropping Ethnology from its title, henceforward became Geography
alone. The Department for the first two years (1869 and 1870) was conducted
under the title of Ethnology, but in 1871 it resumed the name of Anthropology,
given it in 1866, and it flourished to such an extent, attracting so many
 papers and such large audiences, that it was finally constituted into a distinct

HSection, to which the letter was assigned, and which had its first session at

 the memorable meeting at Montreal, exactly ten years ago, under the fitting and
 auspicious presidency of Dr. E. B. Tylor.

      The history of the gradual recognition of Anthropology as a distinct subject
 by this Association is an epitome of the history of its gradual growth, and the
 gradual recognition of its position among other sciences in the world at large, a
 process still in operation and still far from complete. Although the word Anthro-
 pology had certainly existed, but used in a different sense, it was not till well
 into the middle of the present century that it, or any other word, had been
 thought of to designate collectively the scattered fragments of various kinds of
 knowledge bearing upon the natural history of man, which were beginning to be
 collected from so many diverse sources. Indeed, as I have once before upon a
 similar occasion remarked, one of the great difficulties with regard to making
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                                                                                                                                     763

Anthropology a special subject of study, and devoting a special organisation to its

promotion, is the multifarious nature of the knowledge comprehended under the

title. This very ambition, which endeavours to include such an extensive range

of subjects, ramifying in all directions, illustrating and receiving light from so

many other sciences, appears often to overleap itself, and give a looseness and

indetiniteness to the aims of the individual or the institution proposing to cultivate

it. The old term Ethnology, or the study of peoples or races, has a limited and

definite meaning. It treats of the resemblances and modifications of the diiferent

groups of the human species in their relations to each other, but Anthropology, a3
now understood, has a far wider scope. It treats of mankind as a whole. It

investigates his origin and his relations to the rest of the universe. It invokes the

aid of the sciences of zoology, comparative anatomy and physiology, in its attempts

to estimate the distinctions and resemblances between man and his nearest allies,

and in fixing his place in the scale of living beings. In endeavouring to inves-

tigate the origin and antiquity of man, geology must lend its assistance to

determine the comparative ages of the strata in which the evidences of his exist-

ence are found, and researches into his early history soon trench upon totally

different branches of knowledge. In tracing the progress of the race from its
most primitive condition, the characteristics of its physical structure and relations

with the lower animals are soon left behind, and it is upon evidence of a kind

peculiar to the human species, and by which man is so pre-eminently distinguished

from all other living beings, that our conclusions mainly rest. The study of the

--works of our earliest known forefathers 'prehistoric archaeology' as it is

--commonly called is now almost a science by itself. It investigates the origin of

all human culture, endeavours to trace to their common beginning the sources of

our arts, customs, and history. The difficulty is, what to include and where to
stop ; as, though the term prehistoric may roughly indicate an artificial line

between the province of the anthropologist and that which more legitimately

belongs to the archasologist, the antiquary, and the historian, it is perfectly evident

that the studies of the one pass insensibly into those of the others. Knowledge of

the origin and development oF particular existing customs throws immense light upon

their real nature and importance                                                                                                                              and  conversely,  it  is  often only from  a profound

that we are able to interpret the slight indications aflbrded us by the scanty

remains of primitive civilisation.

It is considerations such as these that have caused the gradual introduction of

the term Anthropology as a substitute for Ethnology which I have traced in the

history of this Association, and which is seen in other organisations for tlie cul-

tivation of our science.

    Tlie first general association for llie study of man in this country was founded
in 1843, under the name of the 'Ethnological Society' (three years, therefore,

Dbefore the Ethnological sub-Section of Section of this Association). It did ex-

cellent work for many years under that title, but partly from pei-sonal considerations,

and partly from a desire to undertake a wider and somewhat different field of

research, another and in some senses a rival society, which adopted the name of

' Anthropological,' was founded in 18G3. For some years these existed side by side,

each representing in its most active supporters different schools of the science.

This arrangement naturally involved a waste of strength, and it was felt that the

interests of the subject would be promoted by an amalgamation of the two
societies. Many difficulties, chiefly, as is usual in such cases, of a personal nature,

had to be overcome, one of the principal being the selection of a name for the

united society. It was generally felt that 'Anthropological' would be most
appropriate, but the members of the old Ethnological Society could not bring them-

selves absolutely to sink the fact of their priority of existence, and all that they

had done for science for so many years, by merging their society into that of their

younger and active rivals                                                                                                                     so after much discussion a compromise was effected, and
                                                                                                                                           ;

the new organisation which arose from the coalescence of the two societies adopted

the rather cumbrous title of 'Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and

Ireland.' This was in 1871, and since that period, the Society, as it is to all
764 REPORT-- 1894.

intents and purposes both in structure and function, has pursued a peaceful and
useful course of existence, holding meetings at stated periods throughout the session,
at which papers are read and subjects of interest to anthropologists exhibited and
discussed. It has also published a quarterly journal, which has been the principal
means in this country of communicating new information upon sucli subjects. The
Institute has for twenty-three years performed this duty in a business-like and
unostentatious manner, the only remarkable circumstance connected with its history
being the singular want of interest taken by the outside world in its proceedings,
considering their intrinsic importance to society, especially in an empire like ours,
·which more than any other affords a field for the study of man, under almost
every aspect of diversity of race, climate, and culture. At the present time it
numbers only 305 ordinary members, whose subscriptions atford barely sutficient
means to maintain the library and journal in a state of efficiency. The kindred
Geographical and Zoological Societies have respectively 3,775 and 2,9S5 fellows,
so far greater is the interest taken in the surface of the earth itself, and in the
animals which dwell upon it, than in its human inhabitants !

      Societies similar in their object to that the history of which 1 have just

sketched have sprung up, and are now in a more or less flourishiog condition, in
every civilised country of the world. But confining our retrospect to our own
country, we may take a glance at what has been done in recent years to promote

the organised study of Anthropolosry otherwise than by means of this Association
(to which I shall refer again later) or the Society of which I have just spoken.

      One of the most potent means of registering facts, and making them available
for future study and reference, is to be found in actual collections of tangible
objects. To very considerable branches of anthropological science this method of
fixing the evidence upon which our knowledge of the subject is based is particu-
larly applicable. These branches are mainly two, very distinct from each other,
 and each representing one of the principal sides in which Anthropology presents

itself.

      I. Collections illustrating the physical structure of man, and its variations in

the diH'erent races.

      II. Collections showing his characteristic customs and methods of living, his
arts, arms and costumes, as developed under ditierent circumstances and also
modified by different racial conditions.

      It is very rarely that these two are combined in one general arrangement, and
 they are almost always studied apart, the characteristics of mind, the general
 education and special training which are required for the successful cultivation of
 either being rarely combined in a single individual ; and yet the complete history of
 any race of mankind, especially with regard to its relation to other races, must be
based upon a knowledge both of its physical and psychical characteristics, and
customs, habits, language, and tradition largely help, when anatomical characters
 fail to separate and define.

     The anthropological museums of this country, as well as elsewhere, are all of
 recent growth, and they are making progress everywhere with steadily accelerating
speed. This cannot be better illustrated than in the place where we are at the
present time. Many of those who are now in this room can remember when the
 materials for the study of either branch of the subject in Oxford were absolutely
 non-existent. I can myself recall the time when the site of the handsome building
"which now houses the scientific treasures of the University was a bare field. All
who know the modern history of Oxford must be aware that it was mainly owing
 to the enthusiastic zeal and steady perseverance in the cause of scientific education
of one who is happily still among us, the veteran Regius Professor of Medicine,
Sir Henry Acland, that that building Avas erected. The possession of a well-
selected and representative collection illustrating the anatomical characters of the
human species is chiefly owing to the energetic labours of Professor Rolleston,

one of the brightest and noblest of Oxford's sons, a man of whom I cannot speak

 without feelings of the strongest affection and most profound regret for his
untimely loss to the University and the world.

      The collection illustrating the arts and customs of primitive people the
              TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.             765

University owes to the ingenuity and munificence of General Pitt-Rivers, who not

only provided the material on which it is based, but also the original and unique
echeme of arrangement, which adds so greatly to its value as a means of education,
and is so admirably calculated to awaken an interest in the subject, even in the
minds of the most superficial visitor. In speaking thus of the method of displaying

the Pitt-Rivers collection, I must not be supposed to imply any disparagement
of others arranged on different plans. Provided there is a definite and consistent

arrangement of some sort, it is well that there should be a diversity in the treat-

ment of different collections, and for such a vast and exhaustive collection as that
under the care of Sir WoUaston Franks, at the British Museum, the geographical

system which has been adopted is certainly the best. In it every specimen of
whatever nature at once finds a place, in which it can at any time be discovered

and recognised.
     In referring to our great national collection, I cannot refrain from saying that

there seemed till lately to be only one element wanting to make it all that could

be desired, and that was space, not only for the proper preservation and eshibition
of what it already contains, but also for its inevitable future expansion. The pro-

vision in this respect was totally inadequate to do justice to the importance of the

subject. Happily this consideration will be no longer a bar to tlie development of
the collection. The provident action of the authorities of the Museum, aided by
the liberality of the Duke of Bedford and the wisdom of Her Majesty's Government,

has secured for many years to come the necessary room for the expansion of the

grandest of our national institutions.

More modern even than museums lias been the introduction of any systematic

teaching of Anthropology into this country. This is certainly most remarkable,

considering that there is no nation to which the subject is of such great importance.

--Its importance to those who have to rule and there are i'ew of us now who are
--not called upon to bear our share of the respousibilities of government can

scarcely be overestimated in an empire like this, the population of which, as I
have just said, is composed of examples of almost every diversity under which the

human body and mind can manifest itself. The physical characteristics of race, so
strongly marked in many cases, are probably always associated with equally or more
diverse characteristics of temper and intellect. In fact, even when the physical
divergences are weakly shown, as in the different races which contribute to make

up the home portion of the Empire, the mental and moral characteristics are still
most strongly marked. As the wise physician will not only study the par-

ticular kind of disease under which his patient is suffering before administering

the approved remedies for such disease, but will also take into careful account the

peculiar idiosyncrasy and inherited tendencies of the individual, which so greatly

modify both the course of the disease and the action of remedies, so it is absolutely

necessary for the statesman who would govern successfully, not to look upon

human nature in the abstract and endeavour to apply universal rules, but to con-

sider the special moral, intellectual, and social capabilities, wants, and aspirations

Aof each particular race with which he has to deal.  form of government under

which one race would live happily and prosperously may to another be the cause

of unendurable misery. All these questions, then, should be carefully studied by

those who have any share in the government of people helonging to races alien to

Athemselves.  knowledge of their special characters and relations to one another

has a more practical object than the mere satisfaction of scientific curiosity ; it is a

knowledge upon which the happiness and prosperity or the reverse of millions of

our fellow-creatures may depend. The ignorance often shown upon these subjects,
even in so select an assembly as the House of Commons, would be ludicrous if

it were not liable to lead to disastrous results.

Now let us consider what, amid all the complex, diverse, and costly machinery

of education in this country, is being done to satisfy the demands for such know-

Weledge.  may say at once, as regards all institutions for primary and secondary

education, absolutely nothing. The inhabitants of the various regions of our own

earth are treated with no more consideration and interest in all such institutions

Wethan if they lived on the moon or the planets.     must turn straight to the
766 REPORT--1894.

higher intellectual centres in the hope of finding any anthropological teaching.

Here, at Oxford, if anywhere, we may expect to find it, and here, first among the
British Universities, have we seen, since the year 1883, among the list of the sub-

_iects taught the word ' Anthropology ; ' hut the teacher, though one of the most

learned of men in the subject the country has produced, still only bears the modest

Atitle of ' Reader.'  prolessorshlp of Anthropology does not exist at present in the

British Isles, and even here the subject, though recognised as a ' special,' offers littla

field for distinction in the examinations for degrees, and has therefore never been

taken up in a thorough manner bj' students. Dr. Tylor's lectures must, however,
have done much to have spread an intelligent interest in some branches of Anthro-

pology, and have proved a valuable complement to the Pitt-Rivers collection, as

Lave also the courses which have been given by Mr. Henry Balfour upon the arts

of mankind and their evolution, one of which I am glad to see is announced among

the advantages oifered to the University E.xtension students at present with us.

Physical Anthropology has also been taken up by Professor A. Thomson, who,

I understand, gives instructive lectures upon it, open to the members of his class of
human anatomy. At the opposite end almost of the subject must be mentioned

the extension and organisation of the Ashmolean Museum under the care of Mr.

Arthur J. Evans, which has a bearing upon some branches of Anthropology, and

the foundation of the Indian Institute under the auspices of Sir Monier Monier-

Williams, which must give an impetus to the study of the characteristics of the

races of our great Empire in the East. Last, but by no means least in its bearing

upon the origin, divisions, and diffusion of races, is the world-famous linguistic

work of Professor Max Miiller and Professor Sayce, boih of whom have presided

over this Section at former meetings of the Association.

    Of the sister University I wrote thus in 1884 : ' In Cambridge there are many
hopeful signs. The recently appointed Professor of Anatomy, Dr. Macalister, is

known to have paid much attention to Anatomical Anthropology, and has already

intimated that he proposes to give instruction in it during the summer term. An

Ethnological and Archseological Museum is also in progress of formation, which, if

not destined to rival that of Oxford, already contains many objects of great value,
and a guarantee of its good preservation and arrangement maybe looked for in the

appointment of Baron Anatole von Iliigel as its first curator.'

    Ten years have pa.'sed, and it is satisfactory to know that the teaching of

Anthropology has not only been fairly established, but the subject has also found a

place in the scheme of University examination. The learned Professor of Human

Anatomy continues to take a wide view of his functions, giving a course during
the Easter term on the methods of Physical Anthropology, and also museum

demonstrations on craniometry and osteometr}', by the aid of a greatly increased

and continually augmenting collection of specimens. 'J'hose students who take

anatomy as their subject for the second part of the Natural Science Tripos have

both paper work and practical examination in .Anthropology, each man liaving a

skull placed in his hands of which lie is expected to make a complete diagnostic

description. For the first part of the tripos each candidate has one or more questions

on the broad general principles of the subject. IVofessor Macalister informs me that
he has always at least si.x men who go through a Tery thorough practical course

with their own hands. There has also lately beeii established a course of lectures

on the Natural History of the Races of Man, delivered during the Michaelmas and

I^ent terms by Dr. Hickson, of Downing College, and Baron von Hiigel gives a

course of museum demonstrations on the weapons, ornaments, and other objects in

the Ethnological Museum, which is open to all students, and of which many take

advantage.

In London, owing to the chaotic condition of all forms of higher instruction,

which has been brought so prominently into notice by the imiversal demand for a

teacliing University (an aspiration which the labours of the late Gresham Com-

mission certainly seem to have brought nearer to realisation than ever appeared

possible before), all systematic anthropological teaching has been entirely neglected.

I'he great collections to which I have already alluded, that of arts and customs at

the liritish Museum, and that of osteological specimens at the Royal College of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  767

Surgeons, have by their steady aus;mentation done valuable service in preserving-

a vast quantity of material for future investigation and instruction, and students

have at present all reasonable facilities for pursuing their own researches in

them. Lectures have never formed any part of the official programme of the
British Museum, but at the College of Surgeons it is otherwise, and though the

contents of the collections are specially indicated as the subject on which they

should be delivered, for the last ten years at least, Anthropology, notwithstanding

the magnificent material at hand for its illustration, has had no place in the annual

syllabus. It is also entirely ignored in the examination scheme of the University
of London, an institution which prides itself as being on a level with modern educa-

tional requirements; and the managers of the new Imperial Institute, casting about
in all directions for some worthy object to occupy their energies and their spacious

buildings, do not appear to have taken into serious consideration the value to the
world and the appropriateness to their original design of a great central school of
Anthropology, i'rom which might emanate a full and satisfying knowledge of the
characteristics of all the various races of which the Empire is composed.

     In Scotland the recent Universities Commission has recognised Physical

Anthropology as a branch of human anatomy in their scheme for graduation in

pure science, the examination on this subject embracing a knowledge of race
characters as found in the skull and other parts of the skeleton, in the skin, eyes,
hair, features, and the external configuration of the body generallj^; the methods
of anthropometrical measurement, both of the living body and the skeleton ; the
possible influence of use and of external surroundings in producing modifications

in the physical characters of man, and an acquaintance with the ' types ' of man-
kind and the structural relations of man to the higher mammals. These regula-
tions came into operation in the University of Edinburgh in 1892, and in accordance
with them Professor Sir William Turner delivers a special course of twenty-five
lectures on Physical Anthropology, and in addition ten practical demonstrations on
osteometry. The museum under his charge has greatly increased of late in number

and value of the specimens. But ' Human Anatomy, including Anthropology,' being

only one of a series of nine subjects in any three or more of which a final science
examination on a higher standard has to be passed, there is not at present any

considerable number of students who take it up, and the other Scotch Universities

have not yet thought it necessary to establish distinct courses of Physical Anthro-
pology, although it is becoming more and more a regular part of the anatomical
teaching to advanced students.

     For the following account of what is being done to further the knowledge of

our subject in the sister isle I am indebted to Professor D. J. Cunningham. The

only place in Ireland where anthropological work is done is Trinity College. For
many years those in charge of the museum have been collecting skulls, and they
were fortunate in obtaining the greater part of Sir William Wilde's collection.
To these great additions have been recently made, principally in the form of Irish
crania from different districts. All the anthropological specimens are lodged in
one large room, which is also used as an anthropometric laboratory. Though there
lias never been any systematic teaching of Anthropology in Trinity College, Dr.
C. R. Browne (Professor Cunningham's able assistant), who takes charge of the
laboratory, attends for two hours on three days a week, and gives demonstrations
in anthropological methods to any students who are interested in the subject.
The laboratory was opened in June 1891, the instruments being provided b)' a
grant from the Royal Irish Academy, and about 500 individuals have already been
measured, the greater number of them students of the College. This is, however,
only part of the work carried out by the laboratory. Every year the instruments
are taken to some selected district in Ireland, and a systematic study of the
inhabitants is made. The Aran Islands, and also the islands of Inishboftin and
Inislishark, have been already worked out, and this year excursions are organised
to Kerry, to a district in Wicklow, and to another in the West of Ireland. The
Academy makes yearly grants to the Committee for carrying on this work, the
results of which have been published in admirable memoirs by Professor A. C.
Haddon and Dr. C. R. Browne. The Science end Art Museum in Dublin, under
--768 REPORT 1894.

the direction of Dr. V. Ball, contains a small collection, arranged with a view to
general instruction, showing by means of skulls and casts the phj'sical character-
istics of the different races of man, those of each race heing explained by a short
printed label, and its range shown on a map.

     Though the development of anthropological science has thus not been greatly
advanced, in this country at least, by means of endowments, or by aid of the
State or, till very recently, by our great scholastic institutions, but has been mainly
left to the unorganised efforts of amateurs of the subject, its progress in recent
years has been undeniably great. I will give an instance of the strides that have
been made in one of its most important branches.

      Physical or Anatomical Anthropology, or the study of the modifications of the

human body under its various aspects, the modifications dependent upon sex and

age, the modifications dependent upon race, and those dependent upon individual

variability, studied not many years ago in a vague and loose manner, has gradually

submitted to a rigorous and, therefore, strictly scientific method of treatment.
The generalities which were formerly used to express the differences that were
recognised between the various subjects compared with each other have been

replaced by terms conveyed in almost mathematical precision. No one acquainted

with the history of the development of this branch of Anthropology can fail to

recognise how much it was accelerated by the genius of Broca, and the school
which he established in France, although all cultivated nations are now vying

with each other in the practice of exactitude in anthropological research, and the

time seems rapidly approaching when a common agreement will be arrived at, by
which all the observations which may be made, under whatever diverse circum-

stances, and by whatever different individuals, will be available for comparison one

with another.
     This branch of our science has received the name of ' Anthropometry.'

Although, as the name implies, measurement is one of its principal features, it
includes such other methods of comparison as can be reduced to a definite
standard, or to which definite tests can be applied, such as the colour of the
hair, eyes, and complexion, the form of the ear and nose. The great desiderata
that have been sought ibr, and gradually attained, in measuring either the
skeleton or the living person have been two in number : 1. Exact definition of
 the points between which the measurements should be taken. 2. Exact methods
 and instruments of measurement. la both these cases the object looked for has
 been not only that the measurements taken by the same observer at different
 times and under different circumstances should coincide, but also that those
 taken by diff'erent observers should be comparable. These requirements seem so

 simple and natural at first sight that tlie majority of persons whom I am
 addressing will wonder that I should allude to them. Only those who are
 seriously occupied, or perhaps I should rather say, only those who were seriously

 occupied a few years ago, with the endeavour to solve these problems can have
 any idea of their difficulty. The amount of time and labour that has been spent upon
 them is enormous, but the result has, I think, been quite commensurate with it.

    We have attained at last to methods of measurement and standards of com-

 parison which, in the hands of persons of ordinary intelligence, and with a
 moderate amount of training, will give data which may be absolutely depended
 upon. From these we hope to be able to formulate accurate information as to
 the physical conformation of all tlie groups into which mankind is divided, and

 so gradually to arrive at a natural classification of those groups, and a knowledge

 of their affinities one to another.

      But the exact methods of modern Anthropometry are not only important ou
 account of the aid they give in studying the race characteristics of man. As has
 60 often happened when scientific observation has been primarily carried out for

 its own sake, it ultimately leads to practical applications undreamt of by its earlier

 cultivators. The application of Anthropometry not to the comparison of race«,

--but to elucidate various social problems as the laws of growth, of heredity, of

 comparative capacities of individuals within a community, and the effects of
 diff'erent kinds of education and occupation, as worked out first by Quetelet in
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                                              769

Belgium, and subsequently by Francis Galton, Roberts, and others in this

--country and its still more concrete application as an aid in administering justice

by methods perfected by Bertillon in France, are striking illustrations of the

practical utility of labours originally undertaken under the influence of devotion to

science pure and simple.

The importance of being able to determine the identity of an individual under

whatever circumstances of disguise he may be presented for examination has, of

course, long been apparent to all who have had anything to do with the adminis-

tration of the criminal law, and rough and ready methods of recognition, de-

pending mainly upon the more or less acute faculty of perception and recollection

of differences and resemblances, possessed by the persons upon wiiom the duty of
identification has devolved, have long been in operation. The general conforma-

tion, height, form of features, and colour of complexion, hair, and eyes, have also

been noted. Much additional assistance has been obtained by the registration of

definite physical characteristics, the results either of natural conformation, or of

injury, such as mutilations, tattoo-marks, and scars, inflicted by accident or design.

The application of one of the most important scientific discoveries of the age,

photography, was eagerly seized upon as a remedy for the difficulties hitherto

met with in tracing personal identity, and enormous numbers of photographs

were taken of persons, the peculiarities of whose career led them to fall into the

hands of the police, and who were likely to be wanted again on some future
occasion. No doubt much help has been derived from this source, but also much
embarrassment. Even among photographic portraits of one's own personal

friends, taken under most favourable circumstances, and with no intention of

deception, we cannot often help exclaiming how unlike they are to the person

represented. With portraits of criminals, the varying expression of the face,

changes in the mode of wearing the hair and beard, diflerences of costume, the

effects of a long lapse of time, years perhaps passed in degradation and misery,

may make such alterations that recognition becomes a matter at least of un-

certainty. That photographs are extremely valuable as aids to identification,

when their true position in the process  is  recognised, cannot be  doubted                                   but as a
                                                                                                           ;

primary method they have been found to be quite inapplicable, owing partly to

the causes just indicated, but mainly to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of

classifying them. The enormous expenditure of time and trouble that must be

consumed in making the comparison between any suspected person and the

various portraits of the stock which accumulates in prison bureaus may be judged

of from the fact that, in Paris alone, upwards of 100,000 such portraits of persons

interesting to the police have been taken in a period of ten years.

The primary desideratum in a system of identification is a ready means of

classifying the data upon which it is based. To accomplish this is the aim of the

Bertillon system. Exact measurements are taken between certain well-known

and fixed points of the bony framework of the body, which are known not to

change under different conditions of life. The length and breadth of the head,

the length of the middle finger, the length of the foot, and the length of the

forearm, are considered the best, though others are added for greater certainty,

as the height, span of arms, length of ear, colour of eyes, &c. All these par-

ticulars of every individual examined are recorded upon a card, and by dividing

each measurement into three classes, long, medium, and short, and by classifying

the various combinations thus obtained, the whole mass of cards, kept arranged

in drawers in the central bureau, is divided up into groups, each containing a

comparatively small number, and therefore quite easily dealt with. "When the

card of a new prisoner is brought in, a few minutes suffice to eliminate the

necessity of comparison with any but one small batch, which presents the special

combination. Then photographs and other means of recognition, as distinctive

marks and form of features, are brought into play, and identification becomes a

matter of certainty. On the other hand, if the combination of measurements upon

a new card does not coincide with any in the classed collection in the bureau, it is

known with absolute certainty that the individual being dealt with has never been

measured before.

--770 REPORT 1894.

One of the most striking results of the introduction of this system into France

has been that, since it has been brought fully into operation, a large proportion of

old offenders, knowing that concealment is hopeless, admit their identity at once,

and save a world of trouble and expense to the police by ceasing to endeavour to

conceal themselves under false names.

Various representations upon this subject have been addressed to the Home

Secretary of our own Government during the last few years, and among others one

from the Council of this Association, -which originated in a resolution of this

Section, adopted by the General Committee at the meeting at Edinburgh in 1892,

to this effect

' That the Council be requested to draw the attention of Her Majesty's Govern-

ment to the Anthropometric Method for the measurement of criminals, which is

successfully in operation in France, Austria, and other Continental countries, and

which has been found effective in the identification of habitual criminals, and con-

sequently in the prevention and repression of crime.'

     In consequence of these representations a Committee was appointed, on Oct. 21,

1893, by Mr. Asquith, consisting of Mr. C. E. Troup, of the Home Office,

Major Arthur Griffiths, Inspector of Prisons, and Mr. Melville Leslie Macnaghten,

Chief Constable in the Metropolitan Police Force, with Mr. H. B. Simpson, of the

Home Office, as secretary, ' to inquire (a) into the method of registering and

identifying habitual criminals now in use in England (b) into the " Anthropo-

record of finger marks : to report whether the anthropometric system or the

finger-mark system can with advantage be adopted in England either in sub-

stitution for or to supplement the existing methods ; and, if so, what arrangements
should be adopted for putting them into practice, and what rules should be made

under Section 8 of the Penal Servitude Act, 1891, for the photographing and

measuring of prisoners.'

The Report of this Committee, with minutes of evidence and appendices, was

issued as a Parliamentary Blue-book in March last, and not only contains a lucid

and concise description of the methods of identification already in use in this

country, but also most striking testimony from impartial but well-qualified

persous to the value of a more scientific mode of dealing with the subject. No

pains seem to have been spared to obtain, both by personal observation and by the

examination of competent witnesses, a thorough knowledge of the advantages of

the Bertillon system as practised in France, and the result has been the recom-

mendation of that system, with certain modifications, for adoption in this country,

with the addition of the remarkably simple, ingenious, and certain method of

personal identification first used in India by Sir William Herschel, but fully

elaborated in this country by Mr. Francis Galton, that called the ' finger-mark

system,' about which I shall have a few more words to say presently.

     With the concluding words of the Committee's Report I most fully concur :

We* may confidently anticipate that, if fairly tried, it will show very satisfactory

results within  a few years in  the  metropolis                                                    but the success of its  application in
                                                                                                ;

the country generally will depend on the voluntary co-operation of the independent

county and borough police forces. This, we feel sure, will not be withheld. When

the principles of the system are understood and its usefulness appreciated we

believe it will not only save much time and labour to the police in the performance

of an important duty, but will give them material assistance in tracing and detecting

the antecedents of the guilty, and will afford, so far as its scope extends, an

absolute safeguard to the innocent.'

    It is very satisfactory to be able to add that in the House of Commons on
June 26, in answer to a question from Colonel Howard Vincent, the Home Secre-

tary announced that the recommendations of the Committee had been adopted

and that, in order to facilitate research into the judicial antecedents of international

criminals, the registers of measurements would be kept on the same plan as that

adopted with such success in France, and also in other Continental countries.

1 have just mentioned the ' finger-mark system,' and of all the various
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  771

developments of Antbropology in recent times none appears to me more interesting

than the work done by Mr. Galton upon this subject ; for though, as indicated
 above, he is not quite the tirst v?ho has looked into the question or shown its
practical application in personal identification, he has carried his work upon it far
 beyond that of any of his predecessors, both in its practical application and into
regions of speculation unthought of by anyone else. Simple and insignificant as
 in the eyes of all the world are the little ridges and furrows which mark the skin

of the under-surface of our fingers, existing in every man, woman, and child bom

into the world, they have been practically unnoticed by everyone until Mr. Galton
lias shown, by a detailed and persevering study of their peculiarities, that they are
full of significance, and amply repay the pains and time spent upon their study. It

is not to be supposed that all the knowledge that may be obtained from a minute
examination of them is yet by any means exhausted, but they have already given

important data for the study of such subjects as variation unaffected by natural or
any other known form of selection, and the difficult problems of heredity, in
addition to their being one of the most valuable means hitherto discovered of

fixing personal identity.

     As an example of the importance of some ready method to prove identity, apart

from its application to the detection, punishment, and prevention of crime, to which

I have already referred, I may recall to your recollection that remarkable trial

which agitated the length and breadth of the land rather more than twenty years
ago ; a trial which occupied so many months of the precious time of our most

-- --eminent judges and counsel, and cost the country, as well as several innocent

persons I am afraid to say how many thousands of pounds, all upon an issue

which might have been settled in two minutes if Roger Tichborne, before starting
on his voyage, had but taken the trouble to imprint his thumb upon a piece of
blackened paper. It is wonderful to me, on reading again the reports of the trial,

to see how comparatively little attention was paid by counsel, judge, or jury, to the

extremely diflerent physical characteristics of the two persons claimed to be
identical, but which wei'e so strongly marked that they ought to have disposed of
the claim, without any hesitation, at the very opening of the case. It was not
until the 102nd day of the first trial that the attention of the jury was pointedly
called to the fact that it was known that Sir Roger Tichborne had been tattooed on
the left arm with a cross, anchor, and a heart, and that the Claimant exhibited no

such marks. When this was clearly brought out and proved, the case broke down

at once. The second trial for perjury occupied the court 188 days, the Lord
Chief Justice's charge alone lasting eight days. The issues were, however, more
complex than in the first trial, as it was not only necessary to prove that the
Claimant was not Tichborne, but also to show that he was someone else. I feel

convinced that at the present time the greater confidence that is reposed in the
methods of Anthropometry or close observance of physical characters, and in the
persistence of such characters through life, would have greatly simplified the whole

case ; and I would strongly recommend all who have nothing about their lives they

think it expedient to conceal to place themselves under the hands of Mr. Galton,

or one of his now numerous disciples, and get an accurate and unimpeachable
register of all those characteristics which will make loss of identity at any future

period a sheer impossibility.

     Partly with this object in view the Association has, for several years past,
during each of its meetings, opened, under the superintendence of Dr. Garson, an
Anthropometric Laboratory, on the plan of the admirable institution of the same

name which has been carried on in the South Kensington Museum since the

beginning of the year 1888, under the direction and at the sole cost of Mr. Francis
Galton, in which up to the present time more than 7,000 complete sets of measure-
ments have been made and recorded. The results obtained at the British Associa-
tion meetings have been published in the Annual Reports of the Association,

and, though on a smaller scale than Mr. Galton's, the operations of the laboratory
have been most useful in diffusing a knowledge of the value of anthropometric
work, and of the methods by which it is carried on.

    For many years an ' Anthropometric ' Committee of the Association, in which

                                                                                 3d2
--772 REPORT 1894.

the late Dr. W. Farr, Mr. F. Galton, Mr. C. Roberts, Dr. Beddoe, Sir Rawson

Rawson, and others, took an active part, was engaged in collecting statistical

information relating to the physical characters, including stature, weight, chest-

girth, colour of eyes and hair, strength of arms, &c., of the inhabitants of the

British Isles ; and their reports, illustrated by maps and diagrams, were published
in the annual volume issued by the Association. This Oommittee terminated its

labours in 1883, although, as was fully acknowledged in the concluding report, the

subject was by no means completely exhausted.

   A great and important work which the Association has now in hand, in some

sense a continuation of that of the Anthropometric Committee, though with a

more extended scope of operation, is the organisation of a complete ethnographical

survey of the United Kingdom based upon scientific principles. In this work

the Association has the co-operation of the Society of Antiquaries of London,

the Folk-lore Society, the Dialect Society, and the Anthropological Institute.

Representatives of these different bodies have been formed into a Committee, of

which Mr. E. W. Brabrook is now chairman. It is proposed to record in a

systematic and uniform character for certain typical villages and the neighbouring

--districts (1) the Physical Types of the Inhabitants, (2) their current Traditions

and Beliefs, (3) Peculiarities of Dialect, (4) Monumental and other Remains of
Ancient Culture, and (6) Historical Evidence as to Continuity of Race. The

numerous Corresponding Societies of the Association scattered over various parts

of the country have been invited to co-operate, and the greater number of them

have cordially responded, and special local committees have been formed in many

places to carry out the work.

The result of a preliminary inquiry as to the places in the United Kingdom

which appeared especially to deserve ethnographic study, mainly on account of the

stationary nature of the population for many generations back, was given in

the first Report of the Committee presented at the Nottingham meeting of the

Association last year, in which it was shown that in the British Isles there are

more than 250 places which, in the opinion of competent authorities, would be

suitable for ethnographic survey, and in which, notwithstanding the rapid changes

which have taken place during the last fifty years in all parts of the country,

much valuable material remains for the Committee to work upon. Without

doubt, as interest in the subject is aroused, this number will be greatly increased.

   A most important step in securing the essential condition that the information

obtained should be of the nature really required for the purpose, and that the

records of different observers should be as far as possible of equal value and

comparable one with another, has been the compilation of a very elaborate

and carefully prepared schedule of questions and directions for distribution among

those who have signified their willingness to assist, and as a guarantee that the

answers obtained to the questions in the schedules will be utilised to the fullest

extent, certain members of the Committee specially qualified for each branch of the

work have undertaken to examine and digest the reports when received.

It may be remarked in passing that the Anthropological Society of Paris has

within the past year formed a Commission of its members to collect in a systematic

manner the scattered data which, when united and digested, shall form ' une

anthropologie veritableinent nationale de la France,' and has issued a circular

with schedules of the required observations. These are, however, at present

limited to the physical characters of the population.

    Among the many services rendered to the science of Anthropology by the

British Association, not the least has been the aid it has afforded in the publication

of that most useful little manual entitled ' Notes and Queries on Anthropology,'

of which the first edition was brought out exactly twenty years ago (1874), under

the supervision and partly at the expense of General Pitt-Rivers. Since that time

the subject has made such great advances that a second edition, brought up to the

Arequirements of the present time, was urgently called for.  Committee of

the Britisli Association, appointed to consider and report upon the best means

of doing this, recommended that the work should be placed in the hands of the

Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. This recommendation
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  773

was approved by the Association, and grants amounting to 701. were made to
assist in defraying the cost of publication. The Council of the Anthropological
Institute appointed a Committee of its members to undertake the revision of the
different subjects, with Dr. J. G. Garson and Mr. C. II. Read as editors respectively
of the two parts into which it is divided. The work was published at the end of
the year 1892, and is invaluable to the traveller or investigator in pointing out the
most important subjects of inquiry, and in directing the observations he may have
the means of making into a methodical and systematic channel.

     Besides those I have already mentioned, the Association has aided many other
anthropological investigations by the appointment of Committees to carry them
out, and in some cases by the more substantial method of giving grants from its
funds, and by defraying the cost of publication of the results iu its journal.
Among these I may specially mention the series of very valuable Reports upon the

Physical Characters, Languages, and Industrial and Social Condition of the North-
Western Tribes of the Dominion of Canada, drawn up by Mr. Horatio Hale, Dr.
F. Boas, and others, the importance of which has been recognised by the Canadian
Government in the form of a grant in aid of the expenses.

     Another very interesting investigation into the Habits, Customs, Physical
Characteristics, and Religion of the Natives of Northern India, initiated by Mr.
H. H. Risley, and carried on under his supervision by the Indian Government,

though it has received little more than moral support from the Association, may

be mentioned here on account of the illustration it affords of the value of exact
anthropometric methods in distinguishing groups of men. Although a practised eye

can frequently tell at a glance the tribe or caste of a man brought before it for

the first time, the special characters upon which the opinion is based have only
lately been reduced to any definite and easily comparable method of description.
In Mr. Risley's examination, the nose, for instance (which I have always held to be
one of the most important of features for classificatory purposes), instead of being

vaguely described as broad or narrow, is accurately measured, and the proportion

of the greatest width to the length (from above downwards), or the 'nasal index,'
as it is termed (though it must not be confounded with the nasal index as defined
by Broca upon the skull), gives a figure by which the main elements of the com-

position of this feature in any individual maybe accurately described. The average
or mean nasal indices of a large number of individuals of any race, tribe, or caste offer
means of comparison which bring out most interesting results. By this character
alone the Dravidian tribes of India are easily separated from the Aryan. ' Even
more striking is the curiously close correspondence between the gi-adations of racial
type indicated by the nasal index and certain of the social data ascertained by
independent inquiry. If we take a series of castes in Bengal, Behar, or the North-

western Provinces, and arrange them in the order of the average nasal index, so
that the caste with the finest nose shall be at the top, and that with the coarsest
at the bottom of the list, it will be found that this order substantially corresponds

--with the accepted order of social precedence. The casteless tribes Kols, Korwas,
--Mundas, and the like who have not yet entered the Brahmanical system, occupy

the lowest place in both series. Then come the vermin-eating Musuhars and the
leather-dressing Chamars. The fisher castes of Bauri, Bind, and Kewat are a
trifle higher in the scale ; the pastoral Goala, the cultivating Kurmi, and a group

-- --of cognate castes from whose hands a Brahman may take water follow in due

order ; and from them we pass to the trading Khatris, the landholding Babhans,
and the upper crust of Hindu society. Thus, it is scarcely a paradox to lay doAvn

as a law of the caste organisation in Eastern India that a man's social status varies
in inverse ratio to the width of his nose.' The results already obtained by this
method of observation have been so important and interesting that it is greatly to

be hoped that the inquiry may be extended throughout the remainder of our Indian

Empire.
     But for want of time I might here refer to the valuable work done in relation

mto the natives of the Andaman Islands, a race many respects of most excep-

tional interest, first by Mr. E. H. Man, and more recently by Mr. M. V. Portman,
^nd for the same reason can scarcely glance at the great progress that is being

made in anthropolop;ical research in other countries than our own. The numerous

workers on this subject in the United States of America are, with great assistance

from the Government, very properly devoting themselves to exploring, collecting,

and publishing, in a systematic and exhaustive manner, every fact that can still be

discovered relating to the history, language, and characters of the aboriginal

population of their own land. They have in this a clear duty set before them,

and they are doing it in splendid style. I wish we could say that the same has

been done with all the native populations in various parts of the world which have

been, to use a current phrase, ' disestablished and disendowed ' by our own country-

Wemen.  are, however, now, as I have shown, not altogether unmindful of what

is our duty to posterity in this respect ; a duty, perhaps, more urgent than that

of any other branch of scientific investigation, as it will not wait. It must be

done, if ever, before the rapid spread of civilised man all over the world, one of the
most remarkable characteristics of the age in which we live, has obliterated what

-- --still remains of the original customs, arts, and beliefs of primitive races ; if, indeed,

it has not succeeded as it too often does in obliterating the races themselves.

   4. On the Diffusion of Mythical Beliefs as Evidence in the History of
           Culture. By Edward B. Ttlor, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.

     The purpose of this communication was to illustrate and systematise the use of
correspondence in culture as means of tracing lines of connection and intercourse
between ancient and remote peoples. Mythical beliefs are especially referred to as
furnishing' good evidence of this class, notwithstanding their want of objective
value. The conception of weighing in a spiritual balance in the judgment of the
dead, which makes its earliest appearance in the Egyptian religion, was traced
thence into a series of variants, serving to draw lines of intercourse through the
Vedic and Zoroastrian religions, extending from Eastern Buddhism to Western
Christendom. The associated doctrine of the Bridge of the Dead, which separates
the good, who pass over, from the wicked, who fall into the abyss, appears first in
ancient Persian religion, reaching in like manner to the extremities of Asia and

Europe. By these mythical beliefs historical ties are practically constituted, con-

necting the great religions of the world, and serving as iines along which their
interdependence is to be followed out. Evidence of the snme kind was brought
forward in support of the theory, not sufficiently recognised by writers on culture
history, of the Asiatic influences under which the prfe-Cohimbian culture of
America took shape. In the religion of old Mexico four great scenes in the
journey of the soul in the land of the dead are mentioned by early Spanish writers
after the conquest, and are depicted in a group in the Aztec" picture-writing known
as the Vatican Codex. The four scenes are, first, the crossing of the river ; second,
the fearful passage of the soul between the two mountains which clash together
third, the soul's climbing up the mountain set with sharp obsidian knives ; foiirthj
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  775

Ihe clangers of the wind carrying such knives on its blast. The Mexican pictures
of these four scenes were compared with more or less closely corresponding pictures
representing scenes from the Buddhist hells or purgatories as depicted on Japanese
temple scrolls. Here, first, the river of death is shown, where the souls wade
across ; second, the souls have to pass between two huge iron mountains, which
are pushed together by two demons ; third, the guilty souls climb the mountain of
knives, whose blades cut their hands and feet ; fourth, fierce blasts of wind drive
against their lacerated forms, the blades of knives flying through the air. It was
argued that the appearance of analogues so close and complex of Buddhist ideas in
Mexico constituted a correspondence of so high an order as to preclude any expla-
nation except direct transmission from one religion to another. The writer,
referring also to Humboldt's argument from the calendars and mythic catastrophes
in Mexico and Asia, and to the correspondence in Bronze Age work and in games
in both region,?, expressed the opinion that on tbese cumulative proofs anthro-
pologists might well feel justified in treating the nations of America as having

reached their level of culture under Asiatic influence.

5. On Complexional Differences between Natives of Ireland with In-
    digenous and Exotic Surnames respectively. By John Beddoe,

     M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.

     Taking his data chiefly from the military reports, the author shows that while
the former class of Irishmen are largely characterised by the prevalence of light

eyes and dark hair, in the latter dark hair is much less frequent. He suggests

that a simple mixture of Englishmen, Scotchmen, &c., with the natives should
have also decidedly increased the proportion of dark eyes, which has not been the
case to any considerable extent ; and that the influence of climate, which, if operative

at all, should tell in favour of the blonde complexion, may have had some efiect

upon an unstable cross-breed.

         4. On the Evolution of Stone Implements. By H. Stopes,

     The author defined an ' Implement ' to be any stone used to facilitate man's

actions, not necessarily made, but used ; use being determined by wear. By

' Evolution ' he meant a series of improvements in flint implements, the result of

mental processes and widening experience, though points are reached in all de-

velopments, beyond which advance on the same lines stops.

The earliest tools were any chance natural stones used for breaking, bruising,

ur hammering. Traces of use are not perceived on these unless they were fre-
quently used, when they became worn or polished. The next step was the selec-

tion of stones suitable for given purposes, and convenient to be held in the

hand. The only signs these show of being implements are also marks of wear.

The author showed many such specimens, and referred to the collection of

Mr. Harrison, of Ightham. Natural stones were next gradually trimmed for use

by a few strokes. These also were illustrated by a series of what the author

termed ' transitional ' forms, as they are intermediate between the selected and used,

and the luorhed and ttsed, or Palaeolithic implements. The transitional stones are

frequently large and rough, generally left-handed, and with thick patination.

The terms PaliBolithic and Neolithic have become indefinite. Many of the

Palaeoliths are evidently meant for handles, and some of them are of finer work

than the Neoliths. Specimens were shown from many localities, but chiefly from

the upper-level gravels of Kent, from 80 feet to 300 feet above the O.D., in-

cluding anvils, hammers, anchors, net-weights, single- and double-pointed drills or

borers,  gyrators,  axes,  spokeshaves, fabricators  and  arrow-heads                                                            and  their  parallels
                                                                                                                              ;

were shown from each period. These are the types of many of the steel tools of

Ato-day.  set of sharp-pointed axes having a spiral twist were shown to be deve-

loped into the peculiar gyrators of the rock-shelter men, found also amongst the

gravels of Swanscomb. Specially instructive are the natural but used stones.

Fully half of these show no bulb of percussion. These invaluable records are fast

disappearing from free use for concrete and road metal. The importance of pre-

serving worked stones for the use of future students, and the value to the critic of

being able to compare a large series together, in order to form just conclusions,

were pointed out.

     The following Reports and Papers were read :

    2. On a New System of Hieroglyphics and a Pro;-Phoenician Script
       from Crete and the Peloponnese. By Arthur J. Evans, M.A.

    The author said that the Mycenaean civilisation was in many respects the
equal contemporary of those of Egypt and Babylonia, and they might well ask

themselves. Was this civilisation wholly dumb ? Homer, at least, contained a

hint that some form of written symbols was in use.
     During a journey to Greece in the preceding year Mr. Evans had obtained a

--clue to the existence of a peculiar kind of seal-stones the chief find-spot of which
--seemed to be Crete presenting symbols of a hieroglyphic nature. This spring he

had been able to follow up his inquiries by the exploration of the ancient sites of
Central and Eastern Crete, and the result of his researches had been to bring to
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  777

light a series of stones presenting pictographic symbols of the same nature, so
that he was now able to put together over seventy symbols belonging to an inde-
pendent hieroglyphic system. More than this, he had discovered, partly on stones
of similar form, partly engraved on prehistoric vases and other materials, a series
of linear characters, a certain proportion of which seemed to grow out of the
pictorial forms. Both these systems of writing were represented as the diagrams
exhibited. It would be seen that, as in the case of the Egyptian and Hittite

symbols, the Cretan hieroglyphs fell into certain distinct classes, such as parts of

the human body, arms and implements, animal and vegetable forms, objects re-
lating to maritime life, astronomical and geometrical symbols. Some of them,

Buch as the two crossed arms with expanded palms, belonged to that interesting
class of pictographs which is rooted in primitive gesture language. The symbols
occurred in groups, and there were traces of a boustrophedon arrangement in the
several lines. The comparisons instituted showed some interesting afiinities to

Hittite forms. Among the tools represented, Mr. Evans was able to recognise

the ' template ' or ' templet ' of a decorative artist, and, with the assistance of a
model of this symbol taken in connection with a design supplied by a Mycensean

gem found in Crete, he was able to reconstruct a MycenEean painted ceiling

analogous to those of Orchomenos and the eighteenth-dynasty Egyptian tombs of

Thebes {circa 1600 B.C.).
     The linear and more alphabetic series of symbols was shown to fit on to

certain signs engraved on the walls of what was apparently a Mycenffian palace
at Knosos, and again to two groups of signs on vase-handles from JNIycente. It
was thus possible to reconstruct a Mycensean script of some twenty-four characters,

each probably having a syllabic value. It further appeared that a large proportion

of these were practically identical with the syllabic signs that survived among the
Greeks of Cyprus to a comparatively late date. The Cypriote system threw a

light on the phonetic value of the Mycenaean.

    Resuming the results arrived at, Mr. Evans said that they had now before

-- --them two systems of primitive script one pictograpbic, the other linear both, as

was shown by the collateral archpeological evidence, belonging to the second
millennium before our era, and to the days before the Phrenician alphabet had
been introduced among the Greeks. Some pictorial forms, however, of the one

series clearly appeared in a linear form in the other ; the double axe, for instance,

--being seen in two stages of linearisation the simpler form identical with the

Cypriote character. On the whole, the pictograpbic or hieroglyphic series seemed

more peculiarly indigenous to Crete, and the linear forms to be Mycenaean in the

widest sense. The Eteocretans, or indigenous stock of the island, who preserved

their language and nationality in the east of the island to the borders of the
historic period, certainly used these hieroglyphs. Mr. Evans gave reasons, based

--on his recent archaeological discoveries in Eastern Crete, for believing what had
--long been suspected on historic and linguistic grounds that the Philistines who,

according to unanimous Hebrew traditions, came from the Mediterranean islands,
and who are often actually called Krethi in the Bible, represented in fact this

old indigenous Cretan stock ; and that they had here the relics and the writing of

' the Phihstines at home.' On Egyptian monuments a people, who came from

'the islands of the sea,' are seen bearing tributary vases of forms, some of which
recur on a whole series of engraved gems seen or collected by Mr. Evans in
Eastern and Central Crete. Their dress, their peaked shoes, their long hair

falling under their arms, all recurred on Cretan designs, representing the in-

habitants of the island in Mycenaean times.

                              By Louis Robinson, M.D.

     The ticklishness which is so marked in children, and which is associated with
laughter, appears to be different from the ticklishness of the surface of the skin.

     Its universal distribution indicates that it was at one time of importance,
although at present it appears to fill no place in the animal economy.

     It is found that in young apes, puppies, and other like animals, the most
ticklish regions correspond to the most vulnerable spots in a fight. In the mock

fights of immaturity, skill in defending these spots is attained.
     In children, and in anthropoid apes which fight with their canine teeth, the

most ticklish regions are practically identical. Young orangs and chimpanzees
grin, and behave otherwise much like children when tickled.

    It seems probable, therefore, that in the ticklishness of children we have a
vestige of a state of racial development when the canine teeth were habitually used
by our ancestors in war for mates or food.

   7. On the Boiv as a Musical Instrument. By H. Balfour, M.A.

    The bow has been for a long while commonly accepted as the prototype of a

large series of stringed musical instruments. Witness the Greek legend which

attributed the first appreciation of the musical potentialities of a tense string to-

Apollo, who observed them in the twang of the bowstring. In India legend refers
the invention of stringed instruments to Siva, who used a bow for musical pur-

poses. In Japan the origin of the six-stringed koto is, in the legend of Amaterasa,
traced to an extemporised instrument composed of six bows lashed together. So,

too, modern writers have for the most part regarded the bow as a parent form of
many of the instruments even of the highest types. Stages in the probable
phylogenetic development of stringed instruments may be studied in the survivals-
of primitive forms still existing in various countries. Simplest of all is the mono-
chord of the Damaras (Ilerero), extemporised from the ordinary shooting bow of

the coimtry by the addition of a string bracing the bowstring to the bow, and
thus tightening it and dividing it into two parts, whose notes are elicited by tap-

ping upon the string with a small stick. To increase the resonance the bow is held
to the mouth of the performer. Stage 2 is represented in m^ny parts of Africa

by musical bows, still simple bows, very slightly modified for musical purposes
only. These are either held in the teeth or to the mouth, or rested upon resonant
bodies (gourds, &c.) to increase resonance. Stage 3 is that in which a resonator is
attached to the bow, usually a gourd, as in the Zulu ' gubo.' Musical bows in these
three stages occur from the Niger down the west of Africa to the Cape, and along
the more easterly regions as far north as the Dohr or Bongo tribes. This dis-
tribution is nearly continuous. In Asia we meet at the present day with musical
bows in forms corresponding with stage 2, as in the Pinaka of North India, a lightly

made bow strung with fine string. Also the musical bow of the Bhuiyars (abori-

ginalj of Mirzapur, though this is an aberrant form. It seems likely that a musical

bow almost identical with the bow and gourd resonator of South Africa exists in
India, this observation being partly based upon a small figure of a man with such
a bow in the Pitt-Rivers collection, and partly upon a study of forms which seem
to have passed through such a stage. In the Malay regions we find musical bows

used with or without resonators in the ' busoi ' of Borneo, and in a simple form in

Timor. Eastwards a variety occurs in the ' pangolo ' of New Britain, a tow with

two strings, one of which is hraced to the bow with a string, as in South African

examples. In the Solomon Islands miniature tows are played upon with the

fingers ; at least three varieties are tnown there, one of which has two strings

(' kalove ' of Florida Island).  In  the  Marquesas  group  a  musical tow  exists                         and
                                                                                                        ;

in the Sandwich Islands an instrument is found which, though it can hardly he

called a ' tow,' is evidently closely allied to the two-stringed * kalove ' of Florida

Island. In the New World a pretty wide range is seen for the musical tow, tut

as it is here evidently of African origin, and owes its transmission to the immi-

gration of African latour, the instrument in this region calls for no special

remark.

    In Africa one may stiU trace stages in the development of the primitive forms

of harps from the musical bow, while the more elatorate harps of the ancient
Egyptians and Greeks show unmistakatle signs of this original derivation, as does
the modern harp of Burma, and that of the Ossetes of the Caucasus, as also several
harp-like forms of medieval times in Western Europe. These all agree in the

atsence of a supporting front pillar, and the many otvious inconveniences of these
forms justify one in saying that these instruments would never have come into

existence except as a gradual development from primitive tow-like forms, the
awkwardness of whose structure persisted through a somewhat tlind adherence to
traditional form. In India there is evidence that the ' vina ' owes its origin to the
Ibow, there still surviving various intermediate t^-pes which can reasonatly te

regarded as survivals of various stages in the phylogeny of the group.

8. The Relations between Body and Mind, as expressed in Early Languages^
         Customs, and Myths. By Rev. G. Hartwell Jones, M.A.

The conditions in which early races lived precluded the possibility of arriving-

at anything like anatomy or psychology. Yet some crude notions appear in
ancient literatures, customs, and myths, and these tecome more intelligitle when

viewed in the light of similar superstitions which have prevailed at all times
among improgressive trites of savages. Naturally, the study of the physical frame

and mental constitution received tut little attention tefore the rise of science in the

East and Asia Minor.

That the Indo-European Urvolh must have had some knowledge of (i.) tJie

body is proved ty their common inheritance of descriptive words for parts of the

hunian frame. Even where the roots of vocables relating to the tody are not akin,

there is a resemtlance in the conccjjtions prevalent in widely distant parts of Europe,

and, indeed, of the globe. Among their common possessions are (1) words, some

describing the creation of the body, others the shape, others the substance. Again,

When(2) the similarity of the conceptions is noteworthy."      analysed, these exhibit

a growth of meaning, transition of thought, and gradual gain in distinctness of

idea. At first, however, there is constant confusion. Thus the bodily sense is
confused with its organ, and a connection was supposed to exist between defects of
the body and mental weakness. The habit also of employing one member to repre-

sent the whole is frequently found in early stages of language, and particularly in

poetry. And if the ideas concerning the "body and its parts were indistinct, as was
to be expected in the earlier stages of human development, still more vague was
the knowledge of (ii.) the mind and its phenomena. Especially common among primi-

tive and backward races is the notion that life, mind, and soul are air, vapour, or

shade ; for example, in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Teutonic languages. Their

general idea, too, of the mental faculties was hazy. Even as late as Homer"s age
the body was regarded as the source of all actions, but by the poet's time know-

ledge had progressed far enough to discriminate the intellectual and emotional

faculties, the power of reflection, memory, and imagination. In this connection

several interesting points arise : (a) in the growth of language and thought the

physical and concrete precede the psychical and abstract ; for instance, in Greek,

Latin, Persian, Sanskrit, and Chinese. (j3) There was until a very late period still
780 REPORT-- 1894.

eome confusion between tlie functions of the different parts of the body, or between

the functions of the blood in relation to those of body and mind. Equally loose

are the notions respecting (iii.) bodily and mental disease. At first the diseased

were put to death, and when the hepling art originated, diseases were attributed

to divine or demoniacal agency. Such was the case even with the Assyrians,

Babylonians, and Greeks. This being the case, supernatural remedies were sought,

and although by Homer's day human methods were employed, yet traces of the

Divine iufluence are distinctly discernible. This is seen in the propitiation of evil

spirits,  such  as  Nosos,  Febris,  Apollo, Artemis                                                                                in   the  superstitious                                                                                                                                                  reverence
                                                                                                                                 ;

with which epilepsy and madness were regarded, together with many other super-

stitions of which glimpses appear as late as Plato. Especially instructive is the

worship of ^Esculapius, the patron of medicine, whose history, stripped of the

legendary lore that has gathered around him, reveals an historical personage. His

traditional descent from the Sun-God, his initiation by the Thessalian Centaur, the

combination of incantations and prayers, with human aids, like embrocations,

ealves, potions, and the knife, the peculiar custom of KaTaKoifiaadai, and the im-

portant part played by the serpent and the cock in his worship, exhibit a

strange mixture of the natural and supernatural, and well illustrate the early

evolution of the art of medicine.

    An examination of the growth of Imowledge of the body and mind, and their

treatment, therefore affords further proof that (1) the primitive condition of the

pioneers of civilisation was no higher than that of savages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             (2)  the parallels

              9. On the Alleged Presence of Negritoes in Borneo.
                                  By H. Ling Roth.

     The circumstantial evidence collected by the late Mr. Earl that a people of a
negroid character existed in Borneo, and the discovery by M. Ilamy of a negrito
skull from that island, has led to the established belief that negritoes exist there.
The skull in question undoubtedly came from Borneo, and it is undoubtedly a
iiegrito skull ; but there is no proof that it originated in Borneo. "VVe know that
Andaman Islanders (negritoes) have been kidnapped by Malay and Ilanum pirates
and carried to India and other parts, so that for the present, in spite of the
strong circumstantial evidence, we must withhold our judgment as to whether

negritoes exist in Borneo.

   10. On the Possibility of a Common Language between Man and other
                       Animals. By Miss Agnes G. Weld.

     The authoress pointed out that the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans believed that
at one time man and animals could understand each other's languages, whilst at
the present day an Irish peasant will tell you that the cock, on Easter morning,
crows in good Erse the tidings that the Lord is risen. In these old and popular
legends most stress is laid on the acquisition of human speech by animals, whereas
modern scientific effort is tending in the reverse direction. She believes that, with
the exception of the parrot and one or two other birds, the creatures below us in
the scale of existence are unable to pronounce the full gamut of sounds we can
utter, some making use of vowels alone, others merely of consonants, so that it is
far easier for us to speak in their language than for them to talk in ours. Miss
Weld proceeded to exemplify this by telling of a daily conversation she used to
hold with a wild nightingale, and tlien narrated the remarkable effect produced by
her upon a savage retriever that had set upon a collie. Miss Weld described how,
when she had growled out certain deep notes of dog language, an awestruck
expression came into the retriever's eyes ; and how, instantly letting go his hold of

the collie, he answered the deep notes by a whispered growl, backing as he did so
into a corner, where he remained, in the most abject terror, not venturing to stir

till Misa Weld was out of sight.

                            1 1 . On Mythical Pygmy Races.
                  By Professor Bertram Windle, B.Sc, 21. D.

    In this communication it was shown that the idea of mythical pygmy peoples,
fairies, or elves, was diiiused throughout the world ; that whilst general leatures
of resemblance were present, there were many points of distinctioo, and notably

with regard to the nature of their supposed dwelling-places, an account of which
was given.

    An attempt was made to show that no single explanation is adequate to

account for these legendary races, but that a number of elements enter into the
composition of the myth.

                         MOXBAY, AUGUST 13.

The following Reports and Papers were read :

1. Pygmies in Europe. By Professor J. Kollmann, M.D.

Near Schaffhausen, in Switzerland, a prehistoric settlement was described by the

author which had been used successively in Palaeolithic, Neolithic, and Metallic

times. Each period was distinctly separated from the other by a ditferently

coloured stratum. The Palaeolithic stratum contained a large number of the broken

bones of reindeer, also those of horse, ice-fox, bear, and other animals in less

number. No human bones were found in it, only worked flakes. It was covered

over by a layer of breccia, 80 cm. thick, which contained no traces of man.

Over this came the NeoUthic stratum, of an average thickness of 40 cm., which

contained potsherds and large quantities of ashes, giving it a grey tinge. Tbe animal

remains found in it were those of stag, roe, black bear, ox, &c. ; the reindeer had

entirely disappeared. The uppermost stratum is a layer of humus 40 to 50 cm.

thick. During its formation man liad ceased to settle there for any length of time

Aunder the shelter of the overhanging rocks.  few implements were found in it,

but they were of an inferior kind, so that this layer of the so-called Metallic period

calls for no further comment. Not so with the Neolithic stratum, in which were

more than twenty human interments, both of adults and children. Eleven of the

latter varied in age from the new-born child up to that of seven years, and some of

them were buried with particular care. The adult interments consisted of the

skeletal remains of (a) full-grown European types, and {b) small-sized people, which

must be considered as pygmies of the Neolithic period of Europe. These two

races were found interred side by side under precisely similar conditions from which
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

it may be concluded that they lived peacefully together, notwithstanding their great

racial difference. The remains of four of these pygmies, and probably of a fifth, were

found. Their stature, estimated according to Manouvrier's method, from the femur,

--is as follows: No. 2, 1,416 mm.; No. 12, 1,355 mm., and No. 14, 1,500 mm.,

giving an average of 1,424 mm. This may be compared with the average stature

of the Veddas of Ceylon, which is 1,576 mm., according to Sarasin, and with the

skeleton of an Andaman Islander measured by the author, in which the femur

measured 424 mm., the stature of the skeleton being 1,500 mm., while the femora

of the Swiss Neolithic pygmies are : No. 2, 369 mm. ; No. 12, 355 mm., and No. 14,
393 mm.

There were seven interments of the taller race, of which the femur of No. 5

measured 454 mm., giving a stature of 1,662 mm., which Rollet found to be the

average height of adult Frenchmen. The remains of the other individuals of this

race could not be satisfactorily measured.
--782 REPORT 1894.

     The author stated, on the authority of Professor Virchow, that the bones of the
small race are not those of a pathologically degenerated people, but of normal
structure. In connection with this find it is important to note that Sergi and
Mantia have discovered some living pygmies in Sicily and Sardinia, mostly under
1,506 mm. in height in Sicily. In appearance they look like miniature Europeans.
In the author's opinion these small types must be regarded, not as diminutive
examples of normal racv^s, but as a distinct species of mankind which occurs in
several types dispersed over the globe ; and he is led to believe that they have been
the precursors of the larger types of man.

      2. On some Stone Implements of Australian Type from, Tasm,ania.
                          By E. B. Tylob, D.C.L., F.R.S.

     The ordinary stone implements used by the Tasmauians were remarkable for
their rudeness. They come generally under the definition of substantial flakes,
trimmed and edged by chipping on one side only, not ground even at the edge, and
grasped in the hand without any kind of handle. The Palaeolithic level of these
implements, notwithstanding their often recent date, had been pointed out by the
writer.' In illustration of this comparison, Tasmanian implements were now
exhibited side by side with flint implements from the cavern of Le Moustier, in
Dordogne. But an important point of exception as to this comparison, mentioned
in the paper referred to, demands reconsideration in view of the new evidence now
brouo-ht forward. In the investigation as to native stone implements conducted about
twenty years ago by the Eoyal Society of Tasmania, some exceptional statements
were made as to stone axes or ' tomahawks ' being ground to an edge, and fixed in
handles, and these were explained as due to the Australian natives who have

passed into Tasmania since the European settlement. What was meant by these
statements now appears more clearly from three ground implements of distinctly
Australian character, well authenticated as brought from Tasmania, and now
exhibited by the courtesy of the Municipality of Brighton, to whose museum they

belong. The largest has a label showing that it was obtained through Dr. Joseph
Milligan, probably from G. A. Robinson, the first protector of the aborigines after
the native war ; and that it was grasped in the hand for notching trees in climb-
inf. The other two specimens are merely marked ' Tasmanian,' with the initials
' G. A. R.' The coexistence of two such difl'erent types as the chipped and ground

forms in Tasmania requires, however, further explanation. This may probably be

found in the immigration of Australians either after or before the English colonisa-

tion, but it would be desirable that anthropologists in Tasmania should make
further inquiry into the question on the spot, so as fully to clear up the interesting
position of the Tasmanian Stone Age.

          3. On Tasmanian Stone Im,plements. By H. Ling Roth.

   4. Tlie Troglodytes of the Bruniquel, a Grotto of Ironworks on the

            Borders of Aveyron. By Dr. Emile Cartailhac.

     The collection of which M. Emile Cartailhac showed photographs has been
formed by the Viscomte de Lastin. It is the complement of the beautiful series
acquired some time ago by the British Museum.

     The eno-ravings upon bone and the sculptures representing animals are very
remarkable, and throw a bright light on the art of the Reindeer Age. Amongst the
most interesting objects are the straight beams of reindeer horn, sculptured at one
extremity in the form of a horse as seen from the front, head lowered against the

breast, feet joined. There are several pieces of this kind, almost similar. Lartet
found similar specimens, but broken and unrecognisable, in the layers of the

Dordogne. Others Lave been described ia tlie rock shelters of the Pyrenees and
in Switzerland. M. Cartailhac laid stress on the conclusions which can be deduced
from the presence of similar pieces in layers so remote. Of all the sculptured
objects of the same epoch this is the only one which to any extent had a look of

repetition.

     M. Emile Cartailhac then entered into an exposition of the facts which led him
to consider that neither the reindeer nor the horse was domesticated or bridled
during the Reindeer Age.

5. A New Statuette of the Reindeer Age representing a Woman, Sculptured
                      in Ivory. By Dr. Emile Cartailhac.

     The rock shelters of Brassempouy, on the waste land north of the little Tillage

of Orthes, includes one of the richest layers of the Quaternary epoch. The mam-
moth and its contemporaneous fauna are largely represented ; with flints, recalling

to mind in some instances the types of Langerie Haute and of Solutre, lay a certain
number of the worked bones and also remarkable pieces of sculpture, some of which
have been described in * Materieux ' and elsewhere ; others are still unpublished.

     Amongst the latter is a broken ivory statuette, collected by M. Dubalen,
Conservateur of the Museum of Mont de Marsan, a portion of which M. Emile
Cartailhac has reconstructed. The loss of the upper part of the bust in this
specimen is very unfortunate, since, if one may judge \)y the rest of the body, it
was carved with great regard to truth and exactitude. This human representation
is the best made one which is known of the reindeer period. It pi'oves once more

the value of the artistic sentiment of these distant ages.
     These engravings and prehistoric sculptures have frequently been compared to

those of the primitive populations of North America and Asia, but the more these
works multiply, the more they affirm the incomparable superiority of the troglo-

dytes, our ancestors.

     M. Emile Cartailhac exhibited the original specimen.

 6. The End of the Stone Age on the Borders of the Mediterranean Basin.
                             By Dr. Emile Cartailhac.

     The author explained the analogies and identities proved to exist at the two
extremities of the Mediterranean--in Egypt, at Troy, in Greece, and at Santorin at
the one end, and in Spain at the other end.

     The civilisation, which corresponds to the end of the Stone Age, appears to have
special characters and a remarkable uniformity. It does not only influence the
same objects, but especially the manners and customs, as shown by exhumed monu-
ments, houses, small market towns, fortifications, and tombs.

     Between the East and the Iberian Peninsula, transition is shown by the
numerous discoveries in Italy, France, Algeria, Tunis, and the Islands. The con-
nections of this primitive civilisation with the Stone Age of the rest of Europe are
remarkable, and illustrate best the diversity of their origins.

          7. On the Present State of Prehistoric. Studies in Belgium.
                            By Count Goblet d'Alviella.

     The author reviewed briefly the various investigations which have been made
in Belgium regarding the early history of man in that country, beginning with
the exploration of the caves, which have in recent years, as well as in earlier
times, yielded Such interesting results as to their occupation as far back as the

period of the mammoth and the reindeer, and also in Neolithic times. He then

proceeded to give an account of Quaternary finds in the plains, consisting of
flint implements in all stages of manufacture, both of Palaeolithic and Neolithic

times. The manufacture of flint implements appeared to have been an important
industry, extending all over Belgium.

     The sites of Neolithic occupation are situated near streams, on the tops of hills,
and promontories of high ground. Villages have heen found consisting of
symmetrically grouped huts excavated in the soil. They contain no trace of
metals, only tools of polished flint and fragments of baked pottery made on the

wheel, and with linear ornamentation.
     E«cent researches have shown the existence of Dolmen monuments, which

was till lately denied. The existence of a real Bronze Age in Belgium has also

been disputed, but finds of bronze articles in tumuli associated with incineration
and burials are becoming more numerous.

    The beginning of the Iron Age is undoubtedly represented in Belgium in
various burial-grounds and tumuli, which have recently yielded new and fruitful

rase arches.

           13. On Ancient Bone Skates. By Robert Munro, 3/.Z).

     The author commenced by observing that the contradictory opinions enun-
ciated by archaeologists in regard to the period when bone skates were used
justified this attempt to define their position in early European civilisation with
greater precision than had hitherto been done. Bone skates had been found in
large numbers in the Terp-monnds of Holland, and among the debris of the
ancient town of Birka, on the island of Bjorko, in Lake Malar. Sporadic examples
were to be seen in various museums throughout Northern Europe, said to have
been found in grave-mounds, lake-dwellings, canal-diggings, &c. The late
Dr. Lindenschmit promulgated the opinion that these objects belonged to the
Stone Age, and this opinion had been subsequently adopted by various archse-
olo^ists. In this paper Dr. Munro has collected and criticised the details of all
the hitherto-recorded discoveries, and comes to the conclusion that there is no
trustworthy evidence in support of the theory that bone skates were ever used
in prehistoric times in Europe. According to the author, they would appear to
have been invented by the early Teutonic races who inhabited the shores of the
Baltic, and to have been introduced into Britain by the early immigrants, who
hailed probably from among the superfluous inhabitants of the Terpen. This
opinion is supported by their geographical distribution, which embraced Holland,
Denmark, the lower portions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and a small district

     The following Papers were read :

     1. On three Neolithic Settlements in North Kent. By Mrs. Stopes.

     Mrs. Stopes treated the topographical relations of the localities in which she
has found the traces of Neolithic settlements in the neighbourhood of Swans-
combe. They all face east. Is there any possible meaning in this ? The shapes
of the tools and Bakes are very similar, though there must have been long intervals
at least between two of them, as one tribe used the pebbles of the AVoolwich and
Reading beds, the other fresh chalk flints of a fine quality. Mrs. Stopes also
noted the information to be gained regarding the chief settlement from the places
in which the dlH'erent types of worked flints are found. The flakes and chips
show where the flint-workers worked; the warlike weapons mark the line of

defence, &c.

           2. On the Native Tribes between the Zambezi and Uganda.
                                   By Lionel Decle.

   --After explaining the origin of the name of Mashona an English corruption of

the nickname of Amashuina (baboons) given by the Matahele to the Makalanga
JNJr. Decle gave a sketch of the various tribes found between the Zambezi and
Uganda, and criticised the classification of the native races according to their
language. He explained how, for instance, some tribes classified as Bantu difiered

physically from others included under the same name. An account was given of

the customs prevailing amongst the people between the Zambezi and Uganda.

--Mr. Decle showed a living specimen from the country he had visited a young
--boy, whom he had brought back with him and gave his history. The boy, who

came from the west shore of Tanganyika, had been sold by his own brother to a
coast man for two yards of calico. Ou the way to the coast he got sore-footed,

and was sold to a Wahha chief for three goats. When Mr, Decle was in the
Wahha country he was attacked every night, and at last, in order to put a stop to

it, he one day caught a chief and threatened to hang him if his goods were not
returned. After much talking Mr. Decle agreed to talte as a ransom the child and

ten goats. The boy, although he refused to return to the Wahha or to his own

people, was for a long time afraid that Mr. Decle would eat him up.

                   3. On the Lex Barbarorum of the Daghestan.
                         By Professor Maxime Kovalevsky.

     The author insisted on the necessity of more trustworthy information as to old
customs and usages being obtained by travellers, and expressed a hope that English
ethnographers in India would search for old collections of sentences pronounced by
judges As an instance, he mentioned the existence of such a treatise in the
Daghestan. It is preserved in Derbent, on the shores of the Caspian, and is known

by the name of the Roustem Code. Olearius, a well-known traveller at the

heginning of the seventeenth century, mentions his visit to Roustem, who was a kind

of elected judge or arbitrator, called an ' outzmi.' His subjects were Tartars of the

Kaitag, who liad no writing of their own. The treatise is written in Arabic. It

contains many very old customs and usages, and admits the vengeance of blood,

which extends from the first to the last relatives inward to all the members of the

tribe, called 'Touchoum.' Compositions are paid in rough linen called mab-

zaldick. Whoever wished to escape the obligations of mutual responsibility was

obliged to declare solemnly that all ties were broken between him and the members

of his tribe, and a nail was placed in the wall of the mosque in commemoration of

it. The treatise of Roustem inflicts a hiffh amercement on those who use it with-

Whoout the permission of the ' outzmi.' '  keeps his mouth will not lose his

head,' is the common saying placed at the top of each sentence. It shows that the

mediators in Daghestan, just like the Brehons of Ireland, kept their knowledge for

themselves and their pupils.

       4. On the N'atives of the Hadramout. By J. Theodore Bent.

     After referring to the ancient inhabitants and the archaeology of this district,
the country from which the ancient world obtained its frankincense and myrrh,
Mr. Bent went on to describe the present inhabitants of the country and the

Heextreme difficulties in the way of pursuing anthropological research in it.

divided the inhabitants as follows, into four divisions, and gave an account of each.
     Firstly, the Bedouins, an obviously aboriginal race, with a religion of their

own and mysticism at variance with the orthodox religion of the land. He con-

sidered them to be more like the Gallas in physique ; and when proper measure-
ments can be taken, in all probability an affinity will be established between these
two races on either side of the Indian Ocean.

    Secondly, the Arabs proper, who came from Yemen and conquered the country
three centuries ago. He gave a description of their women and their customs and
fanaticism, of the men who go to India in search of a livelihood, and of the Sultans
of the Al Kaiti family.

    Thirdly, the Sayyids, a sort of hierarchical nobility who fan the fanatical

tendencies of the race and rule everything, both in religion and law ; and to them
is due the fact that the Hadramout has continued so long to be shut off from
exploration and the rest of the world.

     Fourthly, the slave element, which in this country is considerable. Mr. Bent
described them as living a very happy life and subject to very few social dis-

abilities.

     5. On the Shells used in the Domestic Economy of the Indonesians.
                       By Dr. J. D. C. Schmeltz, of Leiden.

     The author submitted a systematic list of no fewer than 154 shells used by the
aborigines of Indonesia and Oceana in their domestic economy, and a table showing
the geographical distribution of their use for diiTerent purposes. The author gave
an account of the different modes of using shells. Some are much preferred to
others, for a great variety of purposes. Shells are also used in connection with

religious ceremonies. He concluded with some observations on the manner of

making implements, ornaments, &c., from shells.

        6. On the Pantheon of the Fijians. By Basil H. Thomson.

     The author described the Fijian Olympus, the mountain of Nakauvadra. The
tutelar deities of Fijians are the spirits of their dead ancestors. The growth of
this idea may be traced in the development of the complete tribe from a single
family, and the process may be tested by an examination of the bond of tauvu.
Tribes that are tmivu {i.e., sprung from the same root) worship the same gods.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.            787

     The author described the legends of the arrival of the Fijians from the west-
ward and the peopling of Nakauvadra ; the story of Turukawa and the scattering
of the tribes. These fragments of mythology are of historical value.

     The recent discovery of the ' path of the spirits,' the legends that cling to it,
showing the influence of physical geography on the mythology of the Fijian bogies

and apparitions, were briefly described.
     The author described the JSanga cults, the earliest example of missionary

enterprise in the Pacific ; the arcana of the Nanga and their meaning.
     In conclusion he referred to the recent recrudescence of heathen practices and

its political danger.

7. The Distribution of the Picts in Britain, as indicated hy Place-Names.

                                    By J. Gray, B.Sc.

The Picti of North Britain, and the Pictones or Pictavi of South Gaul, are

both mentioned by Roman writers. The evidence of place-names shows that

probably the whole intervening country was at an earlier dare occupied by the

same race. Two roots are employed to determine the relative densities of the

--Picts in Britain viz. Pict and its variants, and Al. The language of the Picts

was Basque. The name Pict is derived from a Basque word, pikatu, to cut.

Aqultania is probably a Qoidelized form of Paquitania, or Pakitaui, and meant in

the Pictish language, the country of the Picts. Pakat is deduced as the earliest

form of the name Pict. The different phonetic changes which pakat can underga

are indicated, and some of these are verified by historical evidence. Place-names

in the British Isles involving all forms of the root Pakat have been classified

punder counties and their densities calculated. Goidelic forms where the initial

is dropped have been calculated as percentages of the total. Some of the con-

--clusions arrived at are that the density of the Picts was greatest in the south

and midlands of England and in the east of Scotland, and least on the east coast

of England, and in Wales. In Ireland the density was only about one-third that

in England. The Goidels, wlio followed the Picts, spread along the valleys of the

Thames and Severn to the Mei-sey, where a part probably crossed to Meath and

spread in two streams to the west coast of Ireland ; the other part moved

northward through Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northumberland, and advanced into

AScotland almost to the Forth.    second incursion entered Scotland by Argyll

and spread along the west counties to the extreme north. The pre-Pictiah in-

habitants were probably Iberians, and prevailed mostly in Ireland, South Wales,

Cumberland, and South Scotland. The olde.st name of Britain, Albion, is de-

rived from Al, the name of an Eastern god worshipped by the Picts, and Bathy

a decayed form of the name Pict.

                        1. On the Brain of a Young Fuegian.
                            By Professor L. Manouvrier.

     Professor Manouvrier described the brain of a Fuegian child, and compared

several of its characters with those of the ordinary European brain. He pointed

out that it is interesting anatomically, physiologically, and psychologically to find
that the external morphology of the Fuegian brain is nearly equal in its develop-
ment to that of the European, though some traces of inferiority exist in the

                                                                                       3 e2

--former as, for example, in the third frontal convolution, or the convolution of

Broca. The author insisted on the physiological signitication of the morphological

development of the brain. He believes that the approximate equality of the

Fuegian brain to the average European brain does not raise doubts as to the
physiological value of cerebral morphology, but rather on the accuracy of the
opinion usually held as to the intellectual inferiority of savage people. This

inferiority, as that of the ancient Gauls in comparison to the Romans, may result
much more from obvious defects in the external conditions which produce civilisa-

tion than from true physiological inferiority conjoined v^ith anatomical inferioritj'.

What makes the physiological value of the morphological development of the

brain an unknown quantity is that other anatomical, physiological, or external
conditions form with it very variable combinations in which the influence of each
factor may be masked or counterbalanced by that of others.

2. On the Valuation of Proportio7ial Dimensiona in the Descrij^tioyi of the
                      Brain. By Professor L. Manouvrier.

3. On the Classificatory System of Relationship. By Rev. Lorimer Fison.

     In this paper the author showed the arrangement of the classificatory sj'stem
of relationship, and the key to it, by an examination of the descendants of two
brothers and their two sisters to the third generation.

     The Fijian terms of relationship were taken as an example of the system.
These divide the sexes in any one generation into groups of non-marriageable
persons and other groups of marriageable persons.

     The same relatives and their descendants were traced in an Australian tribe,
and it was shown that precisely the same groups appear as the result of the
division of a community into two exogamous intermarrying divisions, such as are

found in Australia.

     The inference deduced by the author was that wherever the classificatory
terms appear those divisions of the community exist, or have existed in the past.

                4. On some of the Natives of British Neio Guinea.
                    By H. Bellyse Baildon, M.A., F.R.S.E.

    The materials for this paper were obtained during a visit to British New Guinea

in 1891, the incidents of which had been detailed by the author's sister in the
Geographical Section. The author acknowledged his indebtedness to Mr. and
Mrs. Chalmers for corrections and additional information.

     The observations extended over the group of villages at Port Moresby, those
in the Elema district about Motu-motu ; the dangerous inhabitants of Movi-avi
and, again, further east, the people of Kerepuna and Hula.

   --The natives of Port Moresby consist of two very distinct tribes the Motuans

--and the Koitapuans located in three villages, the principal of which, Hanuabada

(the Big Village), is built on the foreshore of the bay. Of the other two, one is
on the mainland and the other on the beautiful island of Elevala. The juxta-
position of these two tribes is an instance of that curious intertribal commensalism

or economic co-operation often found in New Guinea.

     The Motuans (who must not be confused with the inhabitants of Motu-motu,
a very different people) live chiefly by fishing and the manufacture of pottery,

while the Koitapuans live mainly by hunting. Much traffic goes on between
these two tribes, who supplement each other's requirements, so that commerce
here, as in civilised communities, makes chiefly for peace. The Motu pottery is
also made for purposes of trading with the Motu-motuans and other western tribes,
with whom the Motuans exchange it for sago.

     The people of the Elema country and the fertile land of sago about Motu-motu
differ in many respects from the Motuans. They seem to be a wilder, more high-

spirited and unruly tribe than the more industrial Motuans, who have been called

the 'British' of New Guinea, while the others have been likened to the Irish.

Nor is the comparison  in  the  latter case without titness also                                                                                                                                           for not only  in their

excitability and impatience of control, but also in their light-hearted gaiety and

wit, the resemblances are not far to seek.

The social arrangements here are different from those at Port Moresby, where

the people live enfamille in their cottages; for in Motu-motu the men congregate
in large club-houses or dubus, while the women and children live in smaller

houses. Even married men live in these clubs, and, although they may visit their

families, they must always return to the dubu before daybreak, otherwise they

commit a serious breach of Papuan etiquette. These dubus are curious structures

built on platforms 14 to 16 feet from the ground, and shaped like the open mouth

of a sharls:. Under the great projecting upper jaw or gable the men lounge and smoke

in the daytime, and have their food brought to them here by the women, who are

strictly forbidden to enter the interior, which is helaga, sacred, or tapu to the men.

In each village there are several dubus, occupied by different clans or families. At

a certain age the boys of the clan are taken into the dubu to undergo initiation,

have their heads shaved, and remain in seclusion till their hair is fully grown.

The remainder of the paper dealt in a similar way with inhabitants of Movi-avi

and Kerepuna.

 5. On the Tohas of Gran Chaco, South America. By J. Graham Kerb.

     The author gave a short account of the manners and customs of the Natokoi or
Tobas of the Gran Ohaco. This region is inhabited by very numerous nations of
American Indians, differing markedly in language, customs, and in minor physical
characters. The Tobas are exclusively nomadic in their habits, living entirely on
the products of the chase. They usually go about in small hunting parties, larger
tribal encampments being only formed occasionally, e.g., at particular seasons. In
regard to their mental characters, it was pointed out that they appeared to believe
only in the existence of numerous minor evil spirits, who were the causes of disease,
accidents, defeats in battle, and other misfortunes ; and that their arithmetical
powers were very limited, the limit of counting being usually about five.

              6. On the Maya Indians of Chicken Itzd, Yucatan.
                             By Alfred P. Maudslay.

     In this paper the author gave an account of some excavations of a burial-mound
in the Vera Paz of Guatemala, and the discovery of little jars containing the bones

of the little fingers probably deposited by mourners.

    The earliest notices of the great Maya ruins at Chichea Itza, in Yucatan, were
discussed, and extracts given from a document lately found by Dr. Marimon in
Seville, describing the ceremonies still performed by the Mayas at the great
Cenote at Ghich^n at the time of the Spanish conquest, although the town was

already abandoned and the buildings in ruins.

   A description was given of the great tennis-court, and a model of it exhibited.

The paper concluded by calling attention to some photographs of a hitherto
unknown Maya monument at Ixkum, in which the supporters of the Maya figures
are captives bound with cords, who are altogether unlike the Mayas in appearance,
and probably belong to another race.

7. On the Loochooan Language. By Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain.

     Hitherto only two languages have been generally recognised as spoken in the

--Japanese Empire viz. Japanese proper, and Aino or Ainu, the language of the

hairy aborigines of the north. Professor Chamberlain's paper contains a prelimi-

-- --nary sketch of his analysis of a third language Loochooan known hitherto, or

one might better say suspected, only from a short and exceedingly imperfect
vocabulary by the late Lieutenant Clifford, R.N., appended to Captain Basil Hall's
790 REPORT-- 1894.

'Voyage of Discovery to the Great Loochoo Island,' published in the year 1818.
Mr. Chamberlain has now ascertained that Loochooan stands to Japanese in. about
the same relation that Spanish does to French. The importance of this discovery will
be best appreciated when it is remembered that the Japanese language had hitherto
.stood in a position of complete isolation, without kindred of any sort. With this
new key it will be possible to solve many difficult questions of Japanese philology,
and in the paper the author discusses the formation of the negative conjugation
of Japanese verbs from this new point of view. Mr. Chamberlain also establishes

the fact that Japanese, as we now have it, is the language of the invaders of the
Archipelago, not that of the previous inhabitants, by whom the invaders might be

.supposed to have been absorbed.

                   9. On the Significance of Objects with Holes.
                             By Miss A. W. Buckland.

     This paper treats of what appears to be a world-wide superstition, belongiog to
all races and to all time, in which holes are credited with healing and protective

powers.

     The superstition exists among us at present in the shape of lucky money and

lucky stones, but can be traced back to Neolithic times, in the great holed stones

and dolmens which are found in Great Britain and Ireland as well as in many

countries of Europe, in North Africa, India, Syria, Circassia, and also in America.
The chief of British holed stones, the Men-an-tol, is still known locally as the C'rick-
.stone, and through it people creep for the cure of rheumatism.

     In Siberia wooden figures bored with holes are carried about as a cure for
various diseases, according to the part in which the hole is bored ; and figures of
great age have been found in Peru and among the Eskimo, which seem from the
holes in them to have been intended for the same purpose. Engraved .'hells also

msimilarly bored have been found in ancient Chaldea and the American mounds.

     The same superstition appears to be traceable in the trephined skulls of Neolithic
times found in many countries, and from which amulets have been cut, probably
for the cure of epilepsy, the disease for which the operation was undoubtedly
undertaken, since it was thus employed up to quite recent times; and the bones of
the human skull were always recommended, either grated as a potion, or worn as
an amulet, for the cure of epileptic disease.

     Miss Buckland believes the healing property thus attached to holes to be of
necromantic origin. She regards the hole as the symbol of the underworld, the abode
of the Creator in some cosmogonies, and always of the spirits of dead ancestors.
Hence they are summoned bj- the medicine-men to assist them in their healing
ceremonies and magic incantations ; and thus the hole, through which they are
drawn by sorcery, became to the savage the source of healing, and in this form,
modified by time, it has descended to us.

     The underworld also was the reputed source of wealth ; hence the s^-mbolical hole
in money caused it to be regarded as lucky money, and this probably e.xplains the
use of ring money among the ancients. These symbolical holes are also found in
ceremonial weapons in West Africa and in the South Sea Islands, as they were also
probably in Ancient Egypt and other countries; the idea suggested being that the
Ijearer of the "weapon assumed the power of sending offenders to Hades, lloles exist
also in magic wands and in staves, especially in the South Sea Islands, where the

holes certainly represent deceased ancestors.

     The magic wands and the South Sea staves or idols resemble so strongly the
holed implements of reindeer horn found in caves of Palajolithic times, that
Miss Buckland believes these staves also to have been used by the medicine-men of
that remote period as symbols of the world of spirits over which they assumed
control, and that thus we can trace the superstitions connected with holes to the
eaxUest of the human race.

              1. The Resiyonse of Animals to Changes of Temperature.

                            By M. S. Pembrey, M.A., M.B.

     The simplest method of investigating the response of animals to changes of
temperature is to determine the amounts of carbonic acid which they discharge.
The carbonic acid is a measure, it may be not an exact one, of the heat produced.
Prom this point of view a series of experiments have been made upon the power
which warm-blooded animals possess of varying their production and loss of heat
in such a way that their mean temperature is constant.

    A mouse is a very suitable animal for such experiments, because on account of

its large cutaneous surface compared with its small bulk the reaction to a change
of temperature is very rapid. Within two minutes of a fall in external temperature
from 30° to 18° the mouse increases its output of carbonic acid by 74 per cent.
within one minute of a change from 33°'i!5 to 17°'6 the increase is 60 per cent.
The response to a rise in temperature is not so rapid : within two minutes of a rise
from 18° to 34°'5 the decrease in carbonic acid is 18 per cent. ; within one minute

of a change from 17° to 32° the decrease is 5 per cent. With cold surroundmgs the
mouse is very active, whereas with a warm temperature it becomes quiet and goes
to sleep. The relationship between muscular activity and the production of heat

is well shown.'

     Experiments were next made upon the developing chick. It is a warm-blooded
animal, but during its development it was probable that it passed through a stage
in which it would have responded to changes of temperature in a similar way
to that seen in cold-blooded animals ; that in cold surroundings it would have pro-
duced less carbonic acid, but that with a rise in temperature it would have increased
its output of carbonic acid. The experiments show that during the greater part of

the period of incubation the developing chick responds to changes of temperature in
a similar manner to that of a cold-blooded animal ; that towards the end of incuba-
tion, about the 20th or 21st day, there is an apparently neutral stage in which no

marked response is seen ; that this neutral condition is succeeded, when the chick

--is hatched, by a warm-blooded stage. The intermediate stage may be the resultant

of two opposite tendencies on the one hand the cold-blooded condition, on the

other the imperfectly developed power of regulating the production of heat. When

the developing chick is exposed to shock by the prolonged action of cold, this

neutral condition may be replaced by a return to the cold-blooded stage.

The reaction of the recently-hatched chick is rapid ; a fall of 20° in tempera-

ture will within fifteen minutes raise the carbonic acid to double its previous

amount.

It would appear that this power of regulation depends upon the integrity and

full development of the nervous control of muscular action. The chick directly it

is hatched possesses great control over its muscles ; it is able to run about, feed

itself, and perform other complicated movements. At the same time it is able to

regulate its production of heat.

It was probable that animals born blind and in a very helpless condition would

not possess this power of regulation ; that in their case a fall in external tempera-

ture would be accompanied by a decrease in carbonic acid, and that with a rise of

temperature the output of carbonic acid would be increased. This has been proved

Ato be true in the case of the pigeon.  young pigeon was examined, when it was

one day old, and it was found that a fall of 14° in external temperature caused the

carbonic acid to diminish to one-third its former value within thirty minutes of the

change in temperature. When two days old a similar change of temperature pro-

duced almost as great a fall in the output of carbonic acid ; raising the temperature

to its former level did not cause the carbonic acid to Increase with the same rapidity

with which it had fallen.

Thus a young pigeon resembles to a certain extent a cold-blooded animal.

There is, however, one great difference. The young pigeon responds very rapidly,

the frog responds extremely slowly.

To study still further the influence of the nervo-muscular system upon the

regulation of temperature by the production of heat, experiments have been made

upon mice after section of the spinal cord and during anaesthesia. Both these

procedures tend to make the mouse respond in a somewhat similar way to that

observed in the cold-blooded animal.

The writer has to thank Messrs. Gordon and Warren for much assistance ini

some of the experiments.

2. On some Experiments to deterviine the Time-relations of the Voluntary
      Tetanus in Man} By David Fraser Harris, B.Sc. Lond., M.B.

1. In a large number of experiments the following apparatus was used :

A metallic case, made air-tight at each end, was fitted over the forearm from

below the elbow to near the wrist. This instrument, practically an air-plethysmo-

graph (for it could register the pulse-beats), had a circular aperture cut in the upper

surface, and over this space was fastened a membrane of gold-beater's skin, to which

was fastened a disc of platinum. There was no tension exerted on the membrane,

which the slightest increase of pressure caused to move, but which, on the cessa-

tion of the agitation, came immediately to rest.

  --Touching the platinum disc was a fine metallic point the end of a screw sup-
Aported by an upright soldered to the metallic case.
                                                      wire was led to a battery,

thence the current traversed an electro-magnetic writer (or ' signal '), and the cir-
cuit was completed to the screw-point. The vibrations of the muscles of the fore-

arm thrown into voluntary tetanus {via the air under the membrane) agitated the

membrane, and so made and broke the current, these interruptions in turn synchro-

nously affecting the writing style of the electro-magnet, which traced on a

revolving drum a myogram of ' incomplete ' tetanus. The rhythm of this as com-

puted from nine different parts of a tracing varied thus : 10, 12, 23-3, 10, 10, 20, 20,
20, 26 "6 vibrations per second, or on an average 168. The average of a very

large number of computations was 133.

  --2. The method employed by Schafer- gave exactly similar results viz. an

average of 10, 8 to 13 being the minimum and maximum rates respectively.

3. This method was modified as follows :

A steel spring, strongly clamped at one end, was arranged so that its free end

could be bent back to touch a hinged upright connected with a tambour; the record-

ing tambour was in connection as in method 2. By pulling on the spring by the

index-finger (the corresponding thumb being at the fixed point of resistance) the

vibratory movements ot tetanic muscles are communicated through the spring to

the air, and so to tLe recording tambour. The graphic representation of tliis is very

similar to that in 2.

     The figures in a typical set of tracings were 9, 6-G, 10,11", 14, 17, 13, 11-7,
18. The average of a large number of experiments was 12-5 vibrations per second.

    4. In this, the apparatus was as in 3, except tliat the myogram was taken on a

rotating cylinder, which also oscillated transversely seventeen times per second.
The tracing was in places identical with that obtained when one combines two

wave-systems whose     periods  are  as  21 :  ;  in  other  places  there  was  a  perfectly

simple wave-form.

    It is contrary to all we know to suppose that the tetanus had twice the rate of

--the cylinder viz. 34 ; the contrary must be true.

     If, then, the tetanus had at times a rhythm of 8'5 per second, and at times rose

to 17, the mean is 12'75.
    5. By a method employing a carbon resistance pile (upon which the muscle was

pressed) in the primary circuit of the inductorium, a capillary electrometer in the

secondary, and viewing the electrometer through a stroboscopic card, a rate of 12:

per second was estimated.

    6. By experiments with the microphone, on which the muscle was laid, the rest

of the connections being as in 5, the rate was fixed at 12-15.

    7. By the microphone laid over the contracting biceps, and a frog's gastro-

cnemius stimulated by secondary shocks (the microphone being in the primary

circuit of inductorium), a rate of 8-15 was estimated, or an average of 11'5 vibra-

tions per second.

The average of these and very many other experiments is 12-5 per second.

3. On Mirror Writing. By Professor F. J. Allen.

4. On a Model of the Cochlea. By John G. M'Kendrick, M.D., F.R.S.,

                  Professor of Physiology in the University of Glasgow.

     Professor M'Kendrick exhibited a working moded intended to illustrate the
mechanism of the cochlea, devised by himself, with the aid of valuable suggestions
by Professor Crum Brown. It consisted of a water-tight glass tank divided into
two compartments by a horizontal glass diaphragm. At the end of each compart-
ment a round hole was cut and covered with an india-rubber membrane. The upper
hole represented the fenestra ovalis, and the lower the fenestra rotunda. The
horizontal glass plate had two holes cut, each of which was supplied with an india-
rubber membrane, and on each membrane there was a steel watch-spring tuned

Anto vibrate at a certain rate. The vibrations of the two springs were as 2 : 1.

arrangement was used for imitating the movements of the stapes, consisting of a
rod caused to oscillate horizontally by an eccentric wheel. In this way pendular
vibrations were transmitted by the fenestra ovalis, and it was shown that when
the number of pushes made by the base of the stapes corresponded to the period of
spring A, spring A began to vibrate ; if the number of pushes was increased A ceased
to move ; and when the pushes reached the period of s, the latter began to move.
Finally, by an appropriate harmonic motion, the wave form of two vibrations of
2 : 1 was transmitted to the fenestra ovalis, and both springs vibrated when the
period of A was reached, thus showing that the apparatus analysed the compound
wave-form. The model generally supported the Ilelmholtz-IIensen theory of the

cochlea. Professor M'Kendrick stated that the Royal Society had enabled him to
continue the investigation, and that a more refined apparatus was in course of

construction.

5. On some Physiological Aj^plications of the Phonograph. By John G.

     M'Kendrick, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology in tlue University

      of Glasgoiv.

      Professor M'Kendrick exhibited one of the newest forms of the phonographs of
the Edison-Bell Corporation, and by the aid of a large resonator adapted to it by
himself he was able to cause the instrument to speak so loudly as to be distinctly

heard throughout the large room in which the Section met. He e'splained the
mechanism of the instrument, and showed how it might be adapted for recording

the voices of two persons at one time, and for transmission of speech to a distance,

by using along with it a microphone in a telephonic circuit. He also described

attempts he had made to register the voice curves by means of a small and light
lever running along the grooves and recording on a small smoked cylinder travelling
at a slow rate, and he exhibited curves obtained in this way. His method was
quite different from that employed by Professor Hermann, of Konigsberg. These
curves showed long undulations, at periods of about one second, with the speech

curves superposed on these. He also explained methods by which the phonograph

might be used for recording respiratory and cardiac sounds, and he stated that,
whilst he had been as yet unable to record cardiac sounds, he had obtained several

respiratory curves, and also the sound of the ticking of a watch. He announced

ills intention of continuing the investigation with more delicate apparatus.

            G. On Trophic Changes in the Nervous System.
By Justus Gaule, Professor of Physiology, University of Zurich.

The author has been able by experiments upon the inferior cervical ganglion of

the sympathetic to bring about changes in different organs, especially in the biceps

and psoas muscles. As the result of further research, he is able to follow out the

trophic efiect from the spot where the operation is performed up to the organ

which subsequently undergoes change. The pathway of this trophic effect passes

through the spinal cord ; the author in previous communications had already pointed

this out as the probable pathway, and now this supposition has been confirmed by

microscopical examination. It has been found that the path is marked out by

·changes of a trophic nature in the nervous system, passing from the point of section

to the organ which undergoes change. It was necessary in order to remove any

doubt to perform the experiment in such a way that the injury caused by the

operation could have little or no part in bringing about the changes in the nervous

system.

At last it was found that the trophic changes took place throughout the whole

length down to the biceps or psoas muscles when a special nerve scarcely visible

to the naked eye was cut awa}^ with scissors from its ganglion. This nerve joins

the ganglion near the spot where one of the accelerator nerves arises. When the
·operation is peribrmed in this way the injury is so slight that if the section does

not involve the right part of the nerve there are practically no after-effects to be

Weobserved in the animal.                                  must therefore attribute to a special trophic influence

those changes which can be observed after the section of the nerve has been

properly performed. The changes can be classified according to the different

parts of the trophic path in which they lie:

Those of (1) the sympathetic                                       ganglion                                            (2) the rami communicantes ;  (3)  the
                                                                                                                    ;

spinal ganglia and posterior roots; (4) the spinal cord; (5) the anterior roots and

nerve-trunks; (G) the smaller divisions of the nerves in muscle; (7) the nerve-

endings  in  muscle                              (8)  and  lastly  those of the                                        muscle  itself.

     The changes in each of these parts are of so special a nature that it is impos-
sible to give a short general description of them. In general the changes are of
such a kind as if the operation caused some substance to be formed or to soak into
the ganglion, and then spread along its nervous connections, bringing about changes
in the chemical conditions of the cells of the tissues until the cells are more or less
completely destroyed. The alteration spreads along the natural pathAvays only as
long as they are intact ; every experiment therefore which destroys the connection
produces no trophic etlect. It appears that a spread of this injurious substance is
possible both in the special ganglia and in the grey substance of the spinal cord,
for the number of altered cells is far greater in the case of the spinal ganglion than

in that of the sympathetic ganglion. In the grey substance of the spinal cord the
change is seen to spread, not only from the posterior to the anterior horns, but also
in the direction from above downwards. In those places where the change has
reached the anterior horns it spreads through the anterior nerve-roots, and thus

arrives at the muscles. At least one finds in the fibres of the nerves which supply

the biceps muscle characteristic changes throughout the whole course of the nerves

down the brachial plexus to the muscle.

7. On the Development of Kidney. By John Berky Haycbaft, M.D.,

                  Professor of Physiology, University College, Cardiff.

     The epithelium of the kidney tubules is originally derived from that of the
ureter and Wolffian duct, as taught by Kolliker. In the rabbit the ureter branches
in the kidney blastema into six or eight tubules, ending in peripheral dilatations,
the primitis'e renal vesicles. These vesicles divide again and again as the kidney
grows, keeping to the extreme cortex, and their stalks forming the collecting

tubules. AH the primary branches of the ureter and many of the above-named

collecting tubules become evaginated to form the pelvis. From the primary renal
vesicles the rest of the tubules grow out as solid and then hollow processes
.and the Bowman's capsule is moulded on a bend of its own tubule, and is not
invaginated by a glomerulus. After birth the primary renal vesicles shrink down
to the size of an ordinarj^ tubule, but at birth they may be seen as dilatations of
the collecting tube when it reaches the extreme cortex and turns round into the

region of the convoluted tubules.

               FRIBAT, AUGUST 10.

     The President, Professor E. A. Schafeb, F.R.S., delivered the following

address :

Before beginning the subject-matter of my address I had conceived it to be

necessary, appearing before you as w'e do as a new Section, to offer some sort of

apology for our presence. But, on looking up the history of the Association,

myI find that  task is somewliat different. If I have any apology to ofier at all

it is that the Section of Physiology has ceased to appear for many years.

The British Association was founded at York in 1831 ; and at the subsequent

meeting, which was held in this very city of Oxford, amongst other Sections which

were established, was one for Anatomy and Physiology. Now, when we consult

the records of this Section we are struck with the fact that Medicine early shows a

marked preponderance. Thus, in 1833 a physician. Dr. Haviland, is selected as

President for the Section; and the secretaries are Dr. II. J. H. Bond, who was

Regius Professor of Physic in the University of Cambridge from 1851 to 187:2

and Mr. (afterwards Sir) G. E. Paget, who succeeded Dr. Bond in the Eegius

Professorship. This preponderance soon came to be recognised in the designation

of the Section, for in 1835 we find it entitled Section E, Anatomy and Medicine.
                                                                                 ,

796 . EEPOBT--1894.

As time went on the interests of medical men became gradually more absorbed

in the rapidly growing British Medical Association ; and in 1841 the medical title

was dropped, and the Section came to be called simply Physiology, which title it

retained until 1847. Under that designation the Section has now been revived.

The fact that Physiology as a separate Section in this Association was

allowed to lapse for so long a period is not remarkable when we remember that

during the first half of this period Physiology as a science was practically non-

existent in this country. The teachers of Physiology were, almost without ex-

ception, practising physicians and surgeons, and even when a professor was

expected to devote his time to the teaching of Physiology he was not expected

to devote part of that time to the prosecution of physiological research. During

all these years, from 18;j3 to 1847, we do not find amongst the officers of the Section

any actual working physiologists. Most of the officers were distinguished medical

men, with an anatomist here and there amongst them. Far be it from me to say

that there was no actual work being done in Physiology at this time ; for Charles

Bell and Marshall Hall were engaged in elucidating the functions of the nervous

system; whilst Bowman, Wharton Jones, and others were producing good and

permanent work in various other departments of Physiology. Their labours, how-

ever, were isolated, and formed but oases in the Sahara of neglect into which the

pursuit of Physiology had fallen in this country ; and this during a period when it
was being pursued with signal success and activity both in Germany and France.

      After 1847 a revival ot Physiology began to manifest itself even here ; and this

Dwas followed by the establishment, from time to time, of a sub-section to Section

which was devoted to Physiology, and had a special President. Whether, however,

owing to their subordinate character, or from some other reason, these sub-sections

had not usually any great measure of success, and for the last twelve years they

have been wholly dropped. During that period Physiology has only twice been

represented in the Chair of Section D, and has usually had no secretarial repre-

sentation. This decadence of Physiology in the British Association during the last

eleven or twelve years is the more remarkable because it is obviously not due to

any want of outside activity in regard to the subject ; for during this period we

find an extraordinary revival of interest in phj'siological research, a revival which

in its most active stage dates from about twentj'-five years ago, but still some

twenty or thirty vears later than the corresponding revival in France and Germany.

I have taken the trouble to prepare a list of prominent physiological workers who

Myflourished during the thirty years prior to 1870.                         list comprises, in all, thirty.

Of these, four are English, five French, and twenty-one German or Dutch. Of the

four English working physiologists not one is a teacher of Physiology. Of the five

French and twenty-one German all are recognised teachers. It was not, in fact,

until it came to be understood that teaching and work in Physiology, as in all

branches of science, ought in the main, to be successful, to go hand in hand, that

the science had any possibility of revival.

Let us glance for a moment at the history of the revival of Physiology in this

country as compared with its revival in Germany. In each country the re-

vival may be said to have been largely due to the influence of one teacher.

In Germany the teacher was Johannes Mtiller; in this country, William Sharpey.

Both of these remarkable men were pupils of Rudolphi, who was Professor of

Anatomy and Physiology in Berlin imtil 1833. It is stated regarding Rudolphi

that ' he was an enemy to subjective speculation in biological science : he looked

on the so-called philosophy as mistaken and futile in its application to the

phenomena of the animal economy, and based his phj'siology chiefl}', and perhaps

rather exclusively, on the study of the animal structure.' The influence of

Rudolphi is apparent in both Miiller and Sharpey.

     Miiller was born in 1801, Sharpey in 1802 ; they were therefore of about the
same age. But Miillar's scientific and intellectual development was more rapid

than that of his contemporary. Thus we find that already in 1826, when he was

but twenty-five years old, Miiller attained so great a reputation as to be made

Professor Extraordinary in the University of  Bonn                          and  before very long he was
                                                                         ;

promoted to the grade of Ordinary Professor there. In 1833, whilst still a

youna: man, he was called to the chair of Anatomy and Physiolofry at Berlin, -which

had iiist become vacant by the death of his master and friend, Kudolphi. Sharpey,
on tlie otber hand, occupied himself until 1829 with perfecting both bis general
and his special anatomical education. It was not until 1830 that he published his
first essay in anatomical and physiological research entitled 'On a Peculiar Motion

--excited in Fluids by the Surlaces of Certain Animals' observations which were

preliminary to the discovery of the existence of cilia in vertebrates. And it was
not until 18.3G that he was called to the newly instituted professorship of Anatomy
and Physiology in University College, Loudon, which be filled for so many years
with such signal success. Both of these distinguished men owed, there is no doubt,

their success as teachers of Physiology to their early anatomical training. Thegeneral

anatomical bent of Johannes Miiller is evidenced by the fact of his scientific work

beingturned so much in thedirection of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology. And

Sharpey, although great, and deservedly great, as a teacher of Physiology, remained

to his dying day, above all, an anatomist. Physiologists of this school are rare at

the present day ; but it is probable that in some respects the progress of Physiology

may suffer thereby. Helmholtz began his public career as professor of Anatomy ; but
it would be unfair to attach too much weight to this particular incident in the case
of so manj'-sided a man as the great Berlin Professor of Physics. Nevertheless, the
necessity of a close and careful training in Anatomy for those who are afterwards

to work at or to teach Physiology is so important that I do not hesitate to say that
the 3'ounger physiologists who neglect the study of Anatomy will find that before
very long they must abandon the pursuit of many byways of Physiology which

might otherwise be followed up with manifest advantage.
     The influence of Johannes Miiller upon the revival of the pursuit of Scientific

WePhysiology in Germany, and indeed generally, cannot be overestimated.

have only to look at the names and eminence of his pupils in order to recognise
the immense influence which his teaching has exerted upon the progress of Physio-
logy ever since his time. Some of these pupils are still amongst us, others have

joined the majority. But the pupils of these men, again, are now great names in
"many departments of our science, and through them we cannot fail to recognise the
influence which was exerted by this truly great man.

   We may say the same in almost identical words of William Sharpey. The

practical pursuit of Physiology in this country has mainly radiated from the centre
where Sharpey taught. Michael Foster was his pupil. The physiological investiga-

tions of Burdon-Sanderson were assisted and encouraged by him. From Sharpey,
therefore, we may trace the rise of the great school of Physiology at Cambridge,
and wo have only to look at the magnificent laboratory which has been erected
here to observe a monument of the influence of the same teacher. And there have

emanated either directly from the physiological school established by Sharpey at

University College, or indirectly from those at Cambridge and Oxford, many of the

most active teachers and workers in Physiology in the kingdom.
     In these respects there is much in common between the revival of Physiology

in Germany and in this countrj'. In other respects, however, the two cases have
been entirely under ditterent conditions. There its revival, in common with

that of science generally, has been assisted and stimulated by the active and

beneficent co-operation of every German State. Here, also in common with

science generally, it has had  to make its  way against  every conceivable obstacle
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

and almost without assistance, either moral or material, from the Government or

from public bodies. But not onlj^ has it not met with assistance, there have been,

actual obstacles placed in the way of teaching and work in Physiojfigy. Some have

been unintentional, others intentional. As an instance of the unintentional may

be mentioned the practice which has obtained in medical schools and on examining

-- --boards a practice which, I am happy to say, is gradually being discarded of

appointing as teachers and examiners in Phj'siology men who may have a good

general knowledge of the science, yet with whom it is not the business of their lives,

and who cannot, therefore, be expected to be as familiar with its details, and as

absorbed in its interests, as those who devote their entire time and attention to its

pursuit.

798 REPORT-- 1894.

The more virulent opposition, in some measure, to science generally, but in the

greatest measure to Physiology, appeared almost simultaneously with the active

revival of the subject. This opposition, which has come to be known as the Anti-
vivisection Movement, but which might equally well bo called the Anti-scientific
Agitation, has hitherto met with no measure of success, except that it has to a

certain extent hampered the full development of the science by diverting to its

defence some of the energy which might be devoted to its pursuit. Indeed, the

actual results of this unreasoning agitation furnish an illustration of the old-esta-

blished principle that persecution of a good cause will in the long run tend

towards its development and propagation. And in this case the chief results have

been the following :

     1. The most immediate effect of the anti-vivisectionist attack was the establish-
ment of the Physiological Society, which in the first instance was only a small
gathering of working physiologists, who met to discuss measures of defence
in a drawing-room in Queen Anne Street. This society, which had such a small
beginning, is now large and important. Its doors are besieged by applicants for

admission, although it is a necessity for such admission that the applicant be either

a teacher of Physiology or a worker at Physiology, or both. Its numerical strength

has grown from ten or fifteen to more than  150                      and  its                     numbers  are  every year
                                                                  ;

increasing. And, besides the work which it has done in this country in promoting the

interests of Physiology, and co-operation between English physiologists, it has suc-

ceeded in establishing a succession of Triennial International Congresses of Physio-

logy, which are amongst the most successful of such gatherings, and which have

been the means of bringing us into communication with the most prominent

physiological workers and teachers on the Continent.

   A2. second result of the agitation was the passing of the so-called Cruelty

to Animals Act. This Act, which was intended to restrict the performance

of experiments upon animals, was in no sense called for, since it had been found

by a Koyal Commission that there was no evidence to show that there had been

unnecessary experimentation upon animals, or any desire on the part of physio-

logists to neglect the use of anaesthetics. On the other hand, it is of inestimable

advantage in that it gives the public a definite guarcantee that the excesses

of which physiologists used to be freely accused are not possible. Such excesses

never did actually occur ; altbougli,to believe all the publications which have been
issued by Anti-vivisection Societies, one would come to the conclusion that a

physiologist is a being who spends his whole time in torturing sensitive creatures,
careless of the suffering which he may cause, or even of the scientific results which

he may obtain. The fanatical supporters of the agitation would have you to

believe  that  we  are  all  neither more  nor less than                                       ;  they cry with Ferdinand

                                                          ' fiends '

that * hell is empty and all the devils are here."

    I am told there was even a feeling of this sort in this ITniversity at the time
when it was proposed to establish the Waj'neflete Professorship of Physiology, and

that an agitation was set on foot having for its object, first, the prevention of

the establishment cf such professorship; and secondly, that being impossible, the

prevention of the professor's practising Physiology. The common-sense of the

University stifled this agitation, and the more intimate acquaintance with physio-

logists which has resulted from the establishment of the school has been suihcient,

I believe, to smother the little fire which was still left smouldering.

   A3. third result of the Anti-vivisection Agitation was the establishment

of the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research. This imme-

diately folloAved a unanimous resolution of the International Medical Congress

of 1881, attirming the necessity of experiments upon animals. To the ignorant

accusation that physiological experiments had been and were of no use or influence

in the advancement of medicine, the leaders of the profession unanimously affirmed

that it is upon Physiology that Medicine and Surgery are based, and that there can

be no real progress in those sciences without a corresponding progress in Experi-

mental Physiology and Palhology. The Association for the Advancement of

Medicine by llesearch has been of the greatest possible vnlue and assistance to

Physiology in this country. It has shown physiologists that they have the great
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                           799

medical profession at their tack, and it has acted as an impartial aud independent

medium of communication between physiologists and the successive Secretaries of

State, whose business it has been to administer the Act.

   A4. fourth result of the attacks of the anti-vivisectionists has been, I may

perhaps be permitted to believe, the re-establishment of this Section of Phy-

siology of the British Association. Those who were present at the meetiDg- of the

Association in Nottingliam may have remarked that the gutters of that town were

strewn with papers which had been forced upon the members of tlie Association

bv the anti-vivisectors of the place. This literature, which iu a double sense may

be termed 'gutter literature,' teemed with flagrant misstatements, aud with vicious

calumnies, directed against physiologists, aud especially called I'orth, I presume, by

the fact that for the tirst time in the history of the British Association a pliysiologist
Wewas called upon to occupy the presidential chair.
                                                     may look upon the esta-

hlishment of tliis Section as the reply of the Association to the false witness which

was borne against us at Nottingham.
    But although a special section for Physiology has been re-established, it may

not be advantageous that there should be one at every meeting' of the Association.

Physiology is above all things a practical science. It requires laboratories and

means of "demonstration. Pliysiologists are rarely satisfied wiili the opportunity

of hearing and reading papers, but require tliat, as mucli as possible, the actual

methods of research employed should be capable of demonstration. By this I am

not to be supposed to advocate the demonstration of experiiuents upon animals,

for there are very many subjects in Physiology which can be both worked at and

illustrated in a manner involving in no sense whatever the word vivisection. But in

order that the methods should be shown, it is important to have the appliances

of a laboratory at hand, and the Association frequently meets in towns which

are not university towns, and have no laboratories, in which, therefore, it would be

difficult or impossible to arrange for demonstrations of the sort that I am alluding

to. On this account we may well imitate the practice of the British Medical
Association, which establishes a Section of Physiology only when its meetings are

held in such a centre as is likely by the appliances which are to be found in that

centre to render the Section useful and efficient. Hence, in recommending the

establishment of a Physiological Section, it is expressly reserved that the Section

shall be held only at such future meetings as may seem to the Council to be

desirable.

    I will now invite you to consider with me one or two of the more obscure

subjects in the range of Physiology, subjects which are, however, creating a great,
almost an absorbing, interest at the present moment. The first of these sub-
jects relates to the structure and function of every cell iu the body. All are
aware that the body of every animal and of every plant is made up of minute
corpuscles which are formed of protoplasm, and which contain in every case at
least one nucleus. The protoplasm and the nucleus form the living substance of
the cell. Other substances may be present, but they are, in a sense, outside the
nucleus and protoplasm, not incorporated with their .substance. Apart from a

few details relating to the structure of the nucleus, this was, until quite lately,

practically all that we knew regarding the parts composing either the animal or

the vegetable cell. There appears, however, to be yet another something which,

although in point of size it is of very insignificant dimensions, yet in point of

function may perhaps be looked upon as transcending in importance, in some
respects, both the protoplasm and the nucleus. Not many years ago it was

noticed by various observers that in certain specialised animal cells the proto-
plasm showed a tendency to radiate from or converge towards a particular point,
and on further investigation it was found that at this point there was a minute

particle. This observation, which began, as we have seen, upon specialised cells,

was, after a little while, found to hold good for other and yet other cells, until, at

the present time, we believe that in every cell of the animal or plant body such a
particle exi.sts. Now, it may well be asked, why after all should so great importance
lae attached to this observation P To this it may be replied that, in the first place,

it is of importance, because it shows conclusively that the whole cell is not of a
--800 REPORT 1894.

uniform nature, since there is this one point within the cell that exerts a special
attraction upon the rest of the cell-substance ; and, indeed, on this account the

particle has come to be termed the ' attraction particle.' And in the second place,

because of the apparent universality of the occurrence of such a particle. And,
thirdly, because of the fact that one of the most important phenomena exhibited
by the cell hinges upon the behaviour of this particle ; for it is found that before a
cell or its nucleus divides this minute attraction particle begins by itself dividing,
and is, in fact, more commonly met v?ith double than single. Nor is it until the two
particles thus produced have evolved, either from themselves or from the substance
of the protoplasm or nucleus, a system of communicating fibres, the so-called achro-
matic spindle, that those changes in the imcleus and protoplasm take place which
produce the division and multiplication of the cell. This attraction particle, which
is also called the central particle or centrosome, has absorbed so great an interest
that, short as is its history, many papers have already been devoted mainly to it, the
latest of these being an elaborate treatise of some 300 pages by Martin Heidenhain.
I shall not here attempt to follow out the details of all these researches, but will be
satisfied with putting before you the conclusion which Heidenhain has come to re-
garding this particle, viz., ' that it is morphologically, physiologically,

and chemically a structure sui generis; not merely a separate
portion of nucleus or of protoplasm, but an organ of the eel 1
with definite functions, and having a definite existence of its

own.' Nevertheless, it is almost as minute an object as it is possible to con-
ceive. In a cell which is magnified a thousand diameters the central particle
appears merely the size of a pin-point. Yet this almost infinitely small object
exerts an extraordinary influence over the whole cell, however large (and the
cell may be many thousand times its size), for it initiates and directs those
processes which result in the multiplication of the cell, and indirectly, therefore, it
 is concerned in directing the general growth of the individual, and ultimately the

propagation of the species.

    A former President of the Association took as the subject of his presidential

address what he was pleased to call the ' Next to Nothings.' In considering this
central particle, of the actual structure of which, and of its chemical constitution,

 we know at present hardly anything, we may surely regard it as a striking instance

 of the supreme importance of the ' next to nothing ' in Physiology.
      The other subjects to which I desire to draw your especial attention relate to

 the physiology of certain organs the functions of which have always been extremely
 obscure, and which, although they differ greatly from one another in almost every

 point of structure, and presumably also in function, it has been usual to group
 together under the name of ductless glands. The name ' gland ' is given to such

 organs of the body as take materials from the blood, and convey those materials

 in an altered or unaltered form, by a tube or duct, to a surface either internal or
 external. Such material is termed the secretion of the gland, and has for its object
 either the performing some function which is useful to the organism or the getting
 rid of material which would be detrimental if retained. In the case of the ductless
 glands there is no such possibility of pouring out material produced by the gland
  upon a surface, because these organs do not communicate with any surface by a

 duct ; and whatever material they may furnish must therefore, if it is to re<ach the

 body generally, pass into the blood ; that is to say, the blood on the one hand
 must furnish the materials for the secretion of the gland, and on the other hand
 it must take up those materials after they have been manufactured into something
 else, and carry them away to other parts of the body. Now, in the case of a
  certain number of the ductless glands there has not appeared to be any very great
  obscurity as to their function ; for some of them seem very obviously to be devoted
  to the formation of corpuscles which are found within the blood itself. But with

  regard to others of these bodies it has not hitherto been possible to find any special

  material in the blood which they have furnished to it, and our knowledge of

  them is derived almost entirely from experiments. I will take the case of two
  of these to illustrate the vast influence which small and almost disregarded
 organs may exert upon the whole economy. But in the first place I may be per-
       THANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  801

mitted to point out what is indeed a self-evident statement, that there is no part
of the body which does not exert some influence upon the rest. Every single
portion of the body is continually taking materials from the blood, and furnishing
to the blood other materials which are formed within it, whether we call that

portion which performs such functions a gland or not ; and it is quite certain that
the removal of any portion of the body would be followed by some permanent

alteration in the blood were it not that other similar parts may by increased

activity compensate for the alterations which the blood would otherwise undergo
from the loss of any one such part. Take the case of a limb. The changes which
the blood undergoes in circulating through it affect the body generally through

that fluid, for the composition of the blood becomes modified in traversing the

limb. And not only is the body affected thus through the medium of the blood,

but, by means of the nerves which pass to and from the limbs, the central nervous
system is itself affected by the movements and alterations of various kinds which

are proceeding in the muscles and other parts, and through the nervous system the
whole organism must constantly be influenced from the limb. There is, however,

no evidence that the removal of a limb or part of a limb permanently modifies
either the condition of the blood or of the nervous system. Nor is such a result to

be expected, for in this case there are other parts of the body possessing similar

organs and performing similar functions, the increased activity of which may easily

compensate for the loss which is sustained through removal of such a part.

     But if we deal with an organ which is not multiple, but unique, and com-
pletely remove this from the body, it is easy to see that the case may be very

different. This organ, like every other organ of the body, is continually taking

from the blood some materials and giving up to it certain other materials. Now

it is clear that its removal must make a permanent difference iu the blood, and,
since the whole organism is remarkably sensitive to even slight changes in the
composition of the circulating fluid, \evy marked results may well follow the

removal of such organ. And this is in fact found experimentally to be the case.

It has long been known that extensive disease of the thyroid gland, a small

reddish organ, weighing about one or two ounces, found at the front of the throat,

is followed by extensive alterations in the nutrition of the b dy generall}'. The-
patient becomes swollen from the overloading of the connective tissues with a

mucinous exudation the nervous and muscular systems are seriously affected ;;
                                                                                                                   ;

the power of generating heat is greatly modified ; and the final result is, in the

first in.stance, the production of a condition of semi-idiocy, ultimately followed, if

the disease be extensive, by death. Precisely similar results have been found in

animals, and in fact in man as well, to follow the complete removal of this bodj'.

Yet the weight of this organ is not more than one sixteen-hundredth part of the

whole weight of the body ; and even this figure does not represent the enormous

influence which a relatively small organ can exert upon the general nutrition of

the body ; for it is found that even if a minute part of the thyroid gland be left

whilst the greater part is removed, the symptoms above enumerated do not super-

yene. Indeed, certain contradictory results which have been g( t by some observers

after removal of the thyroid are explained by the fact that in some individuals
there are minute detached particles of thyroid gland lying apart from the main

organ ; and that after the latter has been removed these detached particles may

sufficiently carry on the function of the organ in relation to the blood and the

nervous system to prevent the supervention of the deleterious symptoms which

usually occur after its removal. Here is, then, a notable instance of the enormous

influence exerted by a 'next to nothing' upon the general organism.

    Another illustration may be given from these ductless gland?. It was noticed

in 1849 by a celebrated physician, Dr. Addison, of Guy's Hospital, that certain

cases, accompanied by extreme debility, occurring in the human subject were

associated with the appearance of peculiar bronzed patches on parts of the skin

and mucous membranes; and on post-mortem examination of these cases, which

--always sooner or later have a fatal termination and indeed sooner rather than
--later he found the symptoms in question to be accompanied by disease and destruc-
--tion of the supra-renal capsules small bodies which are placed close to the kidneys,

but which, so far as we know, have no physiological connection with them. Now,
when experiments came to be directed upon these bodies in order to elucidate their
functions, and especially to observe whether their injury or removal was accom-
panied in animals also hy symptoms similar to those occurring in man as the result
of disease, it was found by Brown-Sequard that when these bodies are totally

removed in any animal the removal is speedily followed by a fatal result. These
experiments of Brown-S(5quard's were made in 1858, and at the time attracted some
attention. They were repeated by other experimenters with similar efiects. But some

of those who removed the supra-renal capsules obtained contrary results, and for
many years the matter remained in an undecided condition. It was even supposed

that the fatal results which were got by Brown-S(5quard might be due to the shock
of the operation or to the fact that the removal necessarilj' involves certain parts of
the sympathetic nervous system, and were not necessarily due to the removal of the
eupra-renals. Recently, however, attention lias been again directed to the subject,
and the experiment of Brown-S(5qiiard lias been repeated by Tizzoni (1889) and

--by Abelous and Langlois (1891 to 1804) in various animals viz. frogs, guinea-

pigs, rabbits, and dogs. I have myself performed confirmatory experiments in
monkeys. The result of all these I'ecent observations is to show that the complete
removal of the supra-renal capsules is not compatible with prolonged existence of
life ; and Abelous and Langlois have shown that it is accompanied by an alteration
in the blood, which renders that fluid poisonous to other animals. The contrary
results which have been obtained by some investigators are apparently due to the
fact that in certain cases there are, as with the thyroid body, small isolated por-
 tions of supra-renal substance (' accessory capsules,' as they are sometimes called)
which have not been noticed and removed at the time of the operation, and that
these small portions of supra-renal substance have served to maintain that proper
relation between the blood and the gland which is sufficient to prevent the super-
vention of the symptoms in question.

      Isow the weight of both supra-renal capsules taken together is not more than
three drachms, and their weight, as compared with that of the whole body, is only
as 1 to 0,000 or less. The accessory supra-renal capsules which may be left after
the removal of the main bodies probably do not originally weigh more than one-
twentieth of the whole structure, and yet this minute proportion of material (a
material, so far as we know, unique in the organism) is nevertheless sufficient to
maintain the composition of the blood and the nutritive equilibrium of the body,
and thus to prevent the necessarily fatal result of complete removal.

     Now it has been found in the case of the thyroid gland that patients in which

this structure has been so diseased that its function is seriously interfered with, and

animals in which it lias been removed entirely, may be greatly benefited, if not indeed

 cured, by tlie inception, either subcutaneously or with food, of the thyroid glands
of animals, or of the juice of such glands. Even where no afiection of the thyroid can

 actually be detected, the exhibition of thyroid juice is frequently beneficial in cerl ain

 conditions of the system ; and it was noticed by Dr. Oliver, of Harrogate, that this
 is especially the case where there is a too-marked constriction of the blood-vessels,
 the juice of this body tending in such cases to reduce the extreme tone of the vascular
 walls, which is the cause of this condition. Encouraged by this result, Dr. Oliver
 was led to examine the efiects of otlier animal extracts, and among them that of
 extract of supra-renal capsule. The efl'ect of this was precisely the reverse of that
 which he had got with the thyroid body, for he obtained evidence tending to show

that in certain cases in man extract of supra-renal capsule can produce an increase
 of vascular tone and a diminution in the size of the arteries. Beyond this point,

 however. Dr. Oliver was unable to proceed by clinical experiment, and he accord-

ingly came to my laboratory with the object of determining the precise physiolo-

 gical effect of the active substance of the capsules. The results which were obtained
 show that there is present in both alcoholic and watery extracts of the gland a
 most potent physiological substance which when injected into the body of an
animal produces, even in minute doses, a remarkable effect upon certain parts of
the nervous ."system, upon the muscular system, upon the heart, and upon the
blood-vessels. If only as much as a grain by weight of supra-renal capsule be ex-
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                  803

tracted with alcohol, and if this alcoholic extract bo allowed to dry, and then be

redissolved in a little water or salt solution and injected into the blood of a dog,

the results which are obtained, considering the rainute amount of substance added
to the blood, are certainly most extraordinary. The nervous centre which regulates

the action of the heart is powerfully affected, so that the heart either beats very

slowly and weakly, or the auricles may even for a time stop beating altogether.

If, however, these inhibitory influences be cut oft" by division of the vagi nerves, the

effect of the poison upon the heart is of an opposite character. There is great accele-

ration of the rate of the beat and a great increase of force. This is accompanied by

a strongly marked influence upon the blood-vessels, and especially upon the arte-

rioles. The walls of these are chiefly muscular, and the drug exerts so powerful

an action upon this muscular tissue as to cause the calibre of the vessels to be

almost obliterated. The heart beint; thus increased in force and accelerated, and

the calibre of the vessels almost obliterated, the result is to raise the pressure of

the blood within the arterial system to an enormous extent, so that from a blcod-

pressure which would be sufficient to balance a column of some four inches of

mercury the pressure may rise so high as to be equal to a column of mercury of

twelve or more inches.
WeThis result is obtained, as we have seen, by a verv minute dose.
                                                                    have to

do here with a substance which is as potent, although in a different direction, as

strychnia. "Whether it is a useful substance formed by the supra-renals from

materials furnished by the blood, and subsequently gradually used in the economy

for the virtue of its action upon the circulatory system, or whether it is to be

regarded as a poison, formed by the tissues during their activity and carried by

the blood to the supra-renals, there to be rendered innocuous, we do not as yet

certainly know. These are important points which mu.st form the subject of

further "investigation. But, however this may be, it is clear that in this gland

also we again meet with an instance of the physiological importance of what Sir

Frederick Bramwell called the ' next to nothing.'

I will give one more instance, taken this time from a gland which is provided

with a duct. Until quite recently it might have been thought that there waa

nothing very obscure regarding the functions of the pancreas. The pancreas is a

digestive gland which lies below and behind the stomach : it has a duct which

carries its secretion into the beginning of the intestine, and that secretion acts

powerfully upon all constituents of the food, digesting starch, meat, and fat. It

was not supposed that the pancreas had any other function to perform. Animals

can live without this secretion, and to a large extent can continue to digest and

absorb their food much as before ; for it has been possible to divert the secretion

from the intestine and to collect it at the surface of the body; and it is found

under these circumstances that, although the food is not quite so readily digested,

nevertheless the animal does not materially suffer from the lack of the secretion.

It was discovered, however, a few years ago (by v. Mering and Minkowski)

that if, instead of merely diverting its secretion, the pancreas is bodily removed,

the metabolic processes of the organism, and especially the metabolism of carbo-

hydrates, are entirely deranged, the result being the production of permanent

diabetes. But if even a very small part of the gland is left vrithiu the body, the

carbohydrate metabolism remains unaltered, and there is no diabetes. The small

portion of the organ which has been allowed to remain (and which need not even

be left in its proper place, but may be transplanted under the skin or elsewhere)

is sufficient, by the exchanges which go on between it and the blood generally, to

prevent those serious consequences to the composition of the blood and the general

constitution of the body which result from the complete removal of this organ.

Now, some years ago it was noticed by Kiihne and Sheridan Lea that, besides its

proper secreting structure composed of tubular alveoli, lined by granule-containing

cells, there are highly vascular patches of peculiar epithelium-like cells scattered

here and there in the substance of the pancreas, which are wholly unconnected

Wewith the ducts and, so far aa one can judge, with the secretion of the gland.

do not know anything whatever about the function of these patches, although

from their vascularity it is extremely probable that they are not without impor-

tance physiologically, and it is tempting to conjecture that it is these cells which
are specially concerned in eil'ecting that influence upon the metabolism of carbo-
hydrates which experiment has shown to be peculiar to the pancreas.

     The lesson to be drawn from these results is clear. There is no organ of the
body, however small, however seemingly unimportant, which we can presume tO'
neglect ; for it may be, as with the supra-renal ciipsules, the thyroid gland, and
the pancreas, that the balance of assimilation and nutrition, upon the proper main-
tenance of which the health of the whole organism immediately depends, hinges
upon the integrity of such obscure structures ; and it is the maintenance of this
balance which constitutes health its disturbance, disease. Nor, on the other
hand, dare we, as the investigation of the attraction-particle has shown, afford to
disregard the most minute detail of structure of the body.

     B. Fate of Liver Fats.
     Before investigating these points certain preliminary observations were

necessary.

     1. What is the best method of extracting the fats? Soxhlet's method was

adopted.

    How2. much of the ether extract is composed of true 'fats? ' For saponifi-

cation and estimation of the ' fatty acids ' the method given by Hoppe Seyler,
the method of Lebedeff, and the method of Kossel and Ohermiiller were tested.
The last was found most satisfactory.

   A large series of observations shows that the fatty acid in the ether

-- --extract varies much from 40 to 70 per cent. averaging about 65 per cent.

      3. Is the proportion of fatty acids the same in the liver as in the ordi-
nary fats of the body ? Lebedeil''s method was used. The solid acids (palmitic
and stearic) are to oleic acid on an average as 1 to 1-.5 ; in fishes, 1 to 3'5. This
agrees with one or two previous estimations. In the fats of the body Lebedeff
 found in a lipoma 1 to 2'37, and in subcutaneous fat 1 to 5-11,

     4. Is the distribution of fats uniform throug^hout the liver? It is found

to he so.
     6. In animals in the same condition is the percentage amount of fat in the

liver nearly the same P Ten observations show that the variation is usually
under 5 per cent., vsrhile the dift'erence in the amount of fatty acids is even

emaller.

     A. The Source of Liver Fats.
     I. Are they directly stored i'rom the fat in the food ?
     a. The amount of fats in the liver at diflerent pei-iods after food was estimated,
and, with the exception of a somewhat doubtful increase between twenty-four and
thirty hours after the meal, no change in the amount of fat could be determined.
Further experiments on this subject are beinp; carried on.
     b. Does the amount of fat bear any relationship to the amount of glycogen ?

As a result of a large number of estimations it is concluded that the fats bear

no relationship to the amount of glycogen.
     II. Are they formed from the fats of the adipose tissue ?

     a. Much of the work already pubHshed on phosphorus poisoning tends to

indicate that they are so formed.

     b. During starvation the amount of fats in the body falls to a much greater

extent than the liver fats, which undergo a comparatively small reduction.
     III. Are they formed during the katabolism of liver protoplasm?
      In the lyost-mortem liver kept for several hours at 40° (J. no change in the

amount of fats has so far been determined. Further experiments on this point

are required.

     B. The fate of the liver fats has not so far been sufficiently investigated
to justify any conclusions.

4. On the Measurement of Simple Reaction Time for Sight, Hearing, and
            Touch. By Professor W. Rutherford, M.D., F.E.S.

     Reaction time is the interval that elapses between the stimulation of a sense
organ and a motor response. The physiological process involved consists of

--{a) an ati'erent factor the stimulation of a sensory terminal and transmission

of an impulse along sensory nerve-fibres to the brain (b) a psychical factor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

involving an act of sensory perception and the voluntary production of a motor

fibres, and muscular contraction. To render the reaction ' simple,' discrimination
is eliminated from the act of perception by repeating the same sensation again
and again without variation in its character ; and choice is eliminated from the
voluntary act by giving the same motor response again and again. In the
author's experiments motor response was given by the right forefinger closing
an electrical key. The stimulus for sight was the movement of a flag attached
to a lever ; that for hearing was a click given by transmitting an induction shock
through a telephone; that for touch was an induction shock or a mechanical
tap. The reaction time was ascertained by recording the moments of stimulation
and of response on a revolving cylinder and also on a pendulum myograph, and
measuring the interval by a tuning-fork. The pendulum myograph has not
hitherto been employed in such experiments. It is very advantageous in experi-
menting on hearing and touch. Successive curves are superimposed, so that
variations in the time of successive reactions are visible at a glance, and can be
readily measured. By photography the record can be readily printed or thrown
on a screen for lecture demonstrations. The reaction times, as measured by the
author's methods, differ considerably from those of some German observers. In
 observations made on eight intelligent healthy men, varying in age from nineteen
 to sixty -two, the reaction time for sight varied from 0-1662 second to 02202 second,
and was mostly between 0-20 second and 0*22 second. The reaction time for
 hearing varied from 0-1448 second to 0T930 second, and was mostly between
0-15 second and 0-16 second. The reaction time for touch varied from 0-1416

 second to 0'1906 second in the different cases. The shortest touch reaction time
 is that following stimulation of the cheek: it varied from 0141 second to 0'157

 second. When tiie skm of a finger was stimulated the reaction time varied from
 0'142 second to O'lOO second, but was mostly from 010 second to 018 second in

 the different cases ; there was no evident relation between age and length of reac-
 tion time in the ca^^es under observation. In a limb the reaction time is generally
 longer the greater the length of sensory nerve traversed by the impulse; but there

may be considerable variations in the reaction times for different districts in the

 fiehi of touch not explicable by difference in the length of sensory nerve traversed,
 but probably due to difference in the closeness of relation between centres lor tactile

sense in the brain and the motor centre for the hand. It may therefore happen
that a response is given sooner by the hand when its skin is stimidated than
when the mucous membrane of the tongue is stimulated, although in the latter
case the impulse has a much shorter tract of sensory nerve to traverse. When the

 right hand gives the response the shortest reaction times for hearing and touch are
obtained by stimulating the right ear and right side of cheek. In the experiments
on sight both eyes were ii-ed at the same time. The influence of fatigue on
reaction time and the remarkable restorative effect of tea were demonstrated in the
photographs.

     Mr. Power showed a series of preparations of the conjunctival and vagina)
mucous membranes taken from rabbits and guinea-pigs which had been subjected

to mechanical and chemical irritation. Many of the epithelial cells presented
appearances which were identical with those described as being parasitic when

they were met with in cancer. The changes in the epithelium were summarised
as a general vacuolation of cells ; various forms of intracellular oedema ; epithelial
' pearls,' collections of leucocytes, and the spaces left after these leucocytes had
migrated. These changes he had already described and figured in the 'British
Medical Journal ' for 1893. The series of preparations shown on the present
occasion indicated that many squamous epithelial cells had the power of phago-

cytosis, for in no other way could the remarkable intracellular appearances be

explained, and he showed cells containing a leucocyte, and others containing a
microcyte. Partial necrosis of the cell also took place as a result of irritation,
and there was an invasion of large eosinophile cells into the conjunctival epi-

thelium.

Pathology and Bacteriology ' for October 1894.

             2. On an Aerotonometer and a Gas-burette.^
                By Professor L^ON Fredericq, Liege.

The air wbich enters the lung is rich in ox^-frcn (20-9 per cent.) and poor in

carbonic acid (0'03 per cent.). On leaving the lung it is relatively poor in oxygen

(18 per cent, in dogs) and rich in carbonic acid (2 to 3 per cent, iu dogs). It has

given up oxygen to the blood and received from it carbonic acid.

    What is the cause of this gaseous exchange between the blood and the air of

the pulmonary alveoli ? Pfliiger believed that he had succeeded in explaining

--this exchange by the simple laws of gaseous diffusion laws in virtue of which

each gas passes from a medium in which its tension is high towards a medium in

which its tension is low. The determinations of carbonic acid ten.^ion made by

Pfliiger's pupils simultaneously in the blood by means of the aerotonometer and in

the air of the pulmonary alveoli were in complete harmony with this explanation.

Christian Bohr has come to a different conclusion on this subject. According

to him, gaseous diffusion alone does not explain the exchange of g.ises between

the blood and the air of the lung. Bohr has found in several of his experiments

the air of the alveoli richer in oxygen and poorer in carbonic acid than in the

arterial blood leaving the lung. According to Bohr, the tissue of the lung plays

an active part in respiration : the pulmonary epithelium excretes carbonic acid by

a true secretion process, and passes oxygen into the blood, not in accordance with

the laws of diffusion, but against these laws.

    I have recently taken up this subject again, and in doing so have made use

of the aerotonometer exhibited to the Section, which is a modification of the

instrument of Pfliiger. The apparatus consists essentially of a sufficiently long

vertical tube, connected above with the carotid of a living animal (an anacstbetised

dog), and below with a vein. The arterial blood (which has previously been

rendered incoagulable by the injection of propeptone) flov/s continuously over the

inner surface of the tube of the aerotonometer, which is kept at a temperature of

o8° C. If the experiment lasts sufficient time for tlie attainment of equality of

tension of the gases of the blood and those enclosed in the aerotonometer, an

analysis of the latter gases will indicate the tension of the gases of the blood.

Bohr believed that equality of tension could be reached in a few minutes, and

thus obtained erroneous results. I have found that nearly two hours are necessary

before equality of tension is reached. One finds then that the air of the aerotono-

meter contains 2 to 3 per cent, of carbonic acid and 12 to 14 per cent, of oxygen,

representing the tension of these gases in the blood in accordance with the

diffusion theory. I have also found that if one lets the animal breathe pure or

nearly pure oxygen, the tension of this gas in the arterial blood may exceed

GO per cent, of an atmosphere. The animal, nevertheless, shows only a slight

tendency to  apnoea                                   it continues to  breathe.  Apnoja is thus not a necessary
                                                   ;

result of a very high oxygen tension in arterial blood. This is a fact which seems

to me very important in connection with the theory of apnoea.

The gas analyses were made with a gas-burette, shown to the Section, which

is simply a modification of that of Hempel. The burette is drawn out at the level

where the readings are made, so as to permit of reading easily to '02 or '01 c.c.

The confining liquid is water (and not mercury), which gives rise to scarcely any

error, diffusion of gases into liquids being so slow. The carbonic acid is absorbed

by potash solution, the oxygen by phosphorus.

cause of subsequent immuDity,the well-known fact that in erysipelas the parts first

attacked may be recovering while the disease is spreading elsewhere would lead

us to suspect that these parts have learnt to resist the streptococcus while the rest

of the body is still susceptible.

   --To inquire whether erysipelas confers any such local immunity was the object

of the following experiments :

Fourteen rabbits which had recently suSered from erysipelas in the right ears

were again inoculated with the streptococcus, this time in both ears. In each case

a control animal, inoculated at the same time, suHered from typical erysipelas.

--The results were as follows: Left ears. In four, only a little redness about the

seat of inoculation. In four, erysipelas commenced, but aborted on the third or

--fourth day. In six, typical erysipelas. Right ears. Inflammation rapidly appeared,

affected the whole part, and subsided in twenty-four to ibrtj'-eigbt hours. Culture

experiments, which invariably revealed the presence of streptococci in the early

stages of true erysipelas, showed that micro-organisms were absent from the

inflamed right ears. Thus all the right ears showed themselves to be immune,

·while nearly one half the left ears proved as susceptible as those of the control

animals. Hence we conclude that the first attack of erysipelas had conferred a

very complete local immunity. That erysipelas confers some degree of general

immunity is already well known from the work of Fehleisen, Roger, and others.

Further experiments showed that this local immunity lasted only so long as

any thickening remained in the ears after erysipelas. Its duration depended, there-

fore, on the severity of the first attack.

The inflammation which resulted from inoculations of ears previously aftected

we thought to be a reaction against the poisons actually introduced, and not due to

the vital activity of the cocci, because we could obtain no evidence that these had

multiplied and invaded the ear. This opinion was put to the test by injecting into

both ears of animals, which had recently suffered from erysipelas in one ear, small

quantities of concentrated filtered cultures, and in one case the streptococci them-

selves destroyed by heat. In these experiments a somewhat violent inflammation,

of short duration (two to three days), resulted in the right ears, and a less severe

but more prolonged infiammation in the left. An important difference was in the

time of onset of this infiammation, which in the previously afi'ected ears appeared

many hours earlier than in the others ; a diflisrence similar to that which had

already been observed to result from the inoculation of living cocci under the same

conditions. Thus it appears that parts which have recently suffered from erysipelas

become more quickly and intensely inflamed when subjected to the action of the

products of the streptococcus than do other parts of the same animal. And when
we remember that this tendency to inflammation goes hand in hand with a notably

greater resistance to the living microbe, we are led to regard it as beneficial in its

action, aud an important  factor   of  local  immunity                                           an opinion in harmony with

              4. A Form of Experimentally-produced Immunity.
        By J. LoRRAiN Smith, M.A., M.D., and E. Trevithick, M.B.

    The occurrence of fibroid changes in the lungs when these are due to the

             _

irritant effect of inhale! dust is, according to clinical authorities, associated with

increased liability of the lungs to infection by the tubercle bacillus. On the other
hand, there is much clinical as well as experimental evidence to show that the

condition of inflammation in the tissues is in general accompanied by an increased
power of resisting the invasion of microbes.

     The following experiments are brought forward to show that, in its early
staees. the inflammation due to irritating dust in the pleural cavity increases the
difficulty of infecting the animal in this locality with the bacillus pyocyaneus.
The experiments were made on guinea-pigs and rabbits.

     The dust (pounded glass) was placed in a bottle containing a quantity of
water. This was sterilised, and before injection the dust was stirred up and mixed
----

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                                       809

-with the water. About 1'5 c.c. of this mixture was drawn into the injecting
cannula. The cannula consisted of a piece of glass tubiug drawn to a sharp
point, with a lateral opening a short distance behind the point. This opening was

made of a size just sutticieut to allow the dust to pass easily through. No force

was needed in the injection, the negative pressure due to the inspiratory act being
sutKcient to suck the moisture into the cavity.

     The effects due to the simple dust were observed in several animals of both
kinds. These consisted in hyper.iemia of the lung with exudation of fluid and red
cells into the alveolar spaces. There was also exudation of fluid into the pleural
cavity in several instances, and it contained usually a considerable number of red
cells also. To some extent the epithelium covering, the pleural surface of the lung,
was thrown oft' into the fluid.

     The dust was rapidly absorbed into the lymphatic vessels, and could be seen,
even after twelve hours, as small round yellowish patches in the pleural membrane.
These when examined microscopically were found to contain large numbers of

glass particles.

     The injection of the bacillus pyocyaneus followed after a time, varying from one

to twenty-six days.

     In the following table we have a summary of the observations.

   --Guinea-pigs. Six animals, with controls:

              Two recovered completely.

                   Three survived the control animals for a period.

                One was a contradictory instance, for this died sooner than the control

                             animal.

  --Rabbits Seven animals, with controls:

               Two recovered, the controls dying on the second day after infection.

                  Three survived the controls in two cases one day, and in one case

                              eight days.

              Two cases in which the bacillus was injected into the opposite pleural

                       cavity. One died with the control, the other earlier.

     The conclusion which is derived from these experiments is that the early stages
cf inflammation confer a certain amount of immunity on the pleural cavity in
which the inflammation has been set up. It does not seem to vary in its protective
power during the tirst month or so after the inflammation has been set up. In
those instances where there was not complete recovery it was usually found that
bacilli occurred to a much greater extent in the pleural exudation of the control

animals than in that of those infected with glass dust.
     The death of the last two rabbits points to the fact that probably the protection

conferred is strictly localised in the inflamed tissues.

distinctly into the optic thalamus, passing through the strise meduUares. They
could not be traced beyond this to the cortex.

roots, and apparently ending in the corpora quadrigemina.

     The following Papers were read :

  1. On the Mechanical Theory of Lymiih Formation. By Dr. Starling.

    2. On Lymph Formation. By Walter S. Lazarus-Barlow, M.D.

     During the course of experiments performed in the Pathological Laboratory,
University of Cambridge, for the investigation of the pathology of the cedema
which accompanies passive congestion the author was led to examine certain of
the conditions that modify the flow of ]ymph in the normal animal.

    He introduced a cannula into one of the lymphatics of the hind limb of a dog,

and, as far as possible, ligatured all remaining lymphatics. The limb was then
emptied as completely as possible of lymph by rapid and firm squeezing from the

paw upwards, and an observation was immediately commenced upon the amount

of lymph formed in the limb during one hour. The animal was under A.O.E.
mixture and was kept absolutely at rest, excepting that coagulation of the lymph
in the cannula was prevented by occasional gentle squeezing of the limb. Imme-
diately before the expiry of the hour the limb was again emptied of lymph as
completely as possibly by firm squeezing. The lymph was collected in carefully
graduated tubes, and the amount thus obtained was regarded as the normal for

the individual.

    An elastic ligature previously arranged round the limb was then tightened to

such an extent as, it was known from other experiments, would raise the pressure
in the femoral vein from the normal 4-5 mm. of mercury to 25-35 mm. Exactly
the same processes were carried out during the collection of lymph under these
modified conditions as were described for the normal conditions. The duration of
increased pressure was one hour. Lastly, the elastic ligature was removed, and
the amount of lymph formed in an hour under normal conditions was again

estimated.

     The limb was therefore as free as possible from lymph immediately before
beginning and immediately before ending each of the three portions of the

investigation.

     The author found that the amounts collected in the three periods were either
absolutely identical, or that the amount collected during the period of high

venous pressure was less than that collected when the pressure was normal. On

no occasion did he find that an increase of venous pressure was accompanied by an
increase in the amount of lymph-flow.

   --The amount of lymph-flow, however, being the product of two factors viz. the

amount of fluid poured out by the blood-vessels and any modifications in that

--amount introduced during the sojourn of the lymph in the tissues it was necessary

before concluding that an increase of lymph-formation does not accompany an
increase in venous pressure to determine whether an excessive amount of fluid had
accumulated in the tissues in the form of oedema, since it was possible that the
increased venous pressure might have caused an increased outflow of fluid from
the capillaries and venules, and that that increased outflow might not have shown
--

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                           811

itself in an increased flow from tlie lymphatics, because it was in part stored up in
the tissues as oedema fluid. To determine this point observations of the specific
gravities of arterial blood and blood-plasraa, venous blood and blood-plasma, of
muscle and of skin were taken before and after the pressure in the femoral vein
was raised. It was found that these underwent no changes whatever, either in
the att'ected limb or in other parts of the body (with the exception of a rise ia
the specific gravity of the venous blood and blood-plasma in the afi'ected limb)
during venous obstruction, which caused a rise of pressure in the i'emoral vein,
varying in individual cases from 48-75 mm. of mercury. The modiflcation of
specific gravity of the venous blood and blood-plasma in the affected limb manifestly
depends upon its lengthened sojourn in the limb.

     The author concludes, therefore, that increase of venous pressure in a limb for
one hour not only does not cause an increase of lymph-flow from the lymphatics,
it does not even cause an increased passage of fluid through the blood-vessel walls.

     Independenth', however, of the venous pressure, the amount of lymph-flow is
increased wlien the tissues have been starved for some time or are overstocked
with their own katabolic products.

     The following conditions were investigated :
     1. Before and after prolonged complete auaimia (three hours), produced by an
Esmarch's bandage.
     2. Before and after hsemostasis, or complete cutting off of the limb, with what-
ever blood and lymph it might contain, from the rest of the body by means of a
tight elastic bandage for one hour.
     3. Before and after stimulation of the sciatic nerve, while the limb was com-
pletely anaemic and persistence in situ of the katabolic products, the whole lasting

one hour.
     All these conditions are followed by arterial dilatation in the part ; and^

inasmuch as arterial dilatation subsequent to section of the sciatic nerve was found
by the author to be unaccompanied by any modification in the amount of lymph-
flow, he concludes that the increase occurring under the conditions given above is

immediately conditioned by the excessive needs of the tissues.
     Under extreme conditions, such as those just given, the eflect of an increase of

venous pressure is markedly difi'erent from what it is when such conditions have
not been introduced, for now an increase of venous pressure is accompanied by an
increase in the lymph-flow, while the lymph-flow diminishes when the venous

pressure is again allowed to return to normal. In other words, the lymph-flow

-- --now varies directly the author cannot say whether it be proportionately with

the venous pressure. It now, therefore, bears some resemblance to mechanical
filtration. Inasmuch, however, as an obstruction to the outflow of blood from the
venous side itself intensities the necessity of the tissues by damming up in them
the waste products they are so anxious to get rid of, this resemblance to mechanical
filtration may, after all, be only apparent.

     The author concludes, therefore, that lymph-formation does not depend upon
purely mechanical conditions of the circulation, but he regards it as dependent
upon the needs of the tissues: those needs are, in some as yet unrecognised way,
made known to the circulatory apparatus, and lead to variations in tlie amount of
blood-flow through the part, in extreme cases active arterial dilatation of the most
marked kind being induced. In such extreme cases, further, the lymph-flow
varies directly with the A-enous pressure, and there is a resemblance to mechanical

filtration; but there are reasons for supposing that this resemblance is an apparent
and not a real one.

            5. On the Production of Heat in Hibernating Animals.
By Raphael Dubois, Professor of Physiology in the University of Lyons.

     For several years the author has investigated the production of heat in the
marmot in order to find out what part of the nervous system is essential for the
rapid production of 'heat which takes place when the animal wakes up from its

winter sleep.

      Section of the spinal cord at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra prevents
the animal from raising its temperature. Destruction of the grey substance of the

train produces a similar efi'eet. If the section of the spinal cord be made at the

level of the seventh cervical vertebra the animal grows warm slowly and incom-

pletely                                     but  if  the  operation  be  performed  between  the  fourth and  iiftti dorsal
                                         ;

vertebrje, then the curve of the rise of temperature presents the normal form.

There is therefore a limited portion of the cord, between the fourth cervical and

the first dorsal vertebrae, through wdiich pass the centripetal or centrifugal, or both,

impulses, placing the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres in communication with the

rest of the organism. The pathway is through the grey substance of the spinal

cord, for section of the autero-lateral or of the posterior columns does not prevent

the animal from producing heat, whereas destruction of the grey matter in this

limited portion of the cord produces the same eil'ect as total section. This opera-
tion produces immediate loss of the power of movement and conscious sensibility

in the greater part of the body ; but tlie absence of the capacity to produce heat
must not be attributed to this sensory and motor paralysis, for section a little

lower, at the fourth dorsal vertebra, does not change the normal curve of tempera-

ture.

The section of the cord at the fourth cervical vertebra abolishes, on the one

hand, the contractions of the thoracic muscles, the activity of which is very great
during the rewarming and insignificant during the torpor; on the other hand, it

cuts oft' the very important connections of the sympathetic system with the higher

centres. If the cervical sympathetic be cut on both sides above the inferior

cervical ganglion there is no very marked delay in the production of heat, whereas

the rise of temperature is very slow and incomplete when the inferior cervical and

the first thoi'acic eanglia are removed on both sides. These ganglia, however, are

only connecting links, for the same result is obtained by section of the two

splanchnic nerves or of the branches which pass directly from the abdominal

sympathetics to the semikuiar ganglia. Extirpation of the semilunar ganglia

produces the same result as removal of the inferior cervical and first thoracic

ganglia.

Experiments show that it is by acting upon the portal system that the sympa-

thetic shares in the general process of heat production. It regulates the quantity

nnd pressure of the blood which flows to the liver, and in this manner the produc-

tion of heat in the liver and the transformation of glycogen into sugar, to be

utilised for combustion when the animal awakes. The thoracic muscles become
exceedingly active when the animal awakes, and thus require more glycogen or

other combustible material for their contraction.

   A full account of this research will shortly be published in ' Les Annales de

i'Universite de Lyon.'

6. On ^Pigeons' Milk.' By E. Waymouth Reid, Professor of Physiology

                                   in University College, Dundee.

     John Hunter (1786) discovered the fact that pigeons feed their young for some
days after hatching upon a substance resembling the curd of milk, and formed in
the lateral pouches of the crop of both cock and hen. This method of feeding is
AS yet only known in this tribe of birds.

      Claude Bernard (1859) studied the nature of the substance, and found that
                            --'

microscopically it consisted of masses of the epithelial scales of the crop mucosa

loaded with fat globules. An analysis made for Bernard by Leconte gave

' Casein ' and salts        23-23
Fat                         10-47
Water                       66-30

--No sugar was present a fact noted also by Hunter.

    Hasse (1865) and more recently Max Teichmann (1889) have also written on

the subject from the histological point of view.

     The lateral pouches of the crop of the non-breeding pigeon are not glandular ;
the epithelium is stratified and free from fat, the submucosa provided with small

vascular papillje.

     The change in the crop membrane necessary for the formation of the ' milk '
commences during the incubation of the eggs, and though not visible to the naked
eye till two or three days before hatching, makes itself evident by the appearance
of fat-droplets in the cells ten days before this event. The main change consists
in a great thickening of the epithelium, accompanied by rugose folding with reticu-
lation, while at the same time the structure becomes enormously vascular and
capillaries penetrate the epithelial layers (Hasse and Teichmann).

     Small pellets of curd-like matter form in the pits of the reticulated surface, and
as soon as the young are hatched these are transferred by the parents to the crops
of the ' squabs,' often to the extent of 40 percent, of the weight of the bodies of the
young.

     In its histological features the process of formation of the ' milk ' resembles more
closely that of the formation of sebum than of milk, for whole masses of fat-holding
cells are cast off from the walls of the pits in the membrane yet, unlike tho

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

sebaceous process, the nuclei of the cells persist.

      Interpapillary involutions, then, of the thickened stratified epithelium of the

crop act as sebaceous glands during the period of formation of the ' milk.'

    This period lasts for from seven to nine days after hatching, and the maximum

of activity is reached about the second day after hatching.
     The young are fed almost exclusively on this substance for the first three days,

though a few crushed grains are also supplied by the parents. The parents appear
to crush the grains at first, though later they are supplied whole. This fact is
accounted for by the condition of the gizzard membrane of the early ' squab,' for
the horny secretion of the tubular glands of the mucosa takes some days to con-
solidate. No digestive ferments are supplied by the parents along with the ' milk/
and the proventriculus of the J'oung ' squab ' pigeon, even at twelve hours, is rich
in proteolytic ferment, its glycerine extract digesting fibrin with ease. The crops
of neither adult (breeding or non-breeding) nor young birds form any amylolytic
or proteolytic ferment; in both cases, however, multitudes of bacteria and cocci

are present, and the acidity of the contents (reaction of Uffelmann, but no reaction

with phloroglncin and vanillin) is probably due to lactic fermentation. The

 pancreas of the * squab ' is capable of digesting starch at the time of hitching.
      In the ' squab ' the cell bodies of the 'milk' are dissolved oft" by the secretion

 of the proventriculus, and the fat set free in the gut is found in the cells of the villi,
and also in the leucocytes of the blood. The faeces of the ' squab ' are fat-free,
 though at an early stage they contain considerable proteid.

      Thougli sugar is undoubtedly absent from the ' milk,' a young ' squab ' pigeon
 before it has received an)^ food contains sugar. In one case a triple alcoholic ex-
 tract of a minced and finally pulverised ' squab ' yielded over -2 per cent, of its
 body weight of reducing sugar, while a subsequent triple aqueous extract gave -16
 per cent, of the body weight of an amylose yielding sugar on boiling with dilute
 sulphuric acid. This amylose strucii no colour with iodine, and attempts to demon-
 strate glycogen in the bodies of unfed ' squab ' pigeons have failed, though the
 pectoral muscles of adult birds are very rich in this substance.

     As regards the proteids of the * milk,' extracts with ' normal saline solution
 by trituration and digestion with thymol at 40° C. show absence of albumins,

 proteoses, and peptones presence of globulin and of caseinogen (clot with rennet,
                                                                                                                   ;

·with and without calcic chloride). The chipf proteid, however, appeai-s to be of the
nature of nucleo-albumin (Halliburton's sodic-chloride method). Mucin is present
in variable anaount, and originates from the glands of the gullet below the crop.
The.se glands enlarge and become more active during the feeding of the young.

     The young pigeon is, then, fod at first upon a highly nutritious food, whose
solids consist in the main of nucleo-albamin and fiit. The explanation of this
peculiar process lies in all probability in the fact that since pigeons rear so many
broods in a season the young must be brought forward faster than could result

from mere grain feeding, and hence a magnificently nutrient diet is supplied.

When a cock or hen ' in milk ' is separated from the young the involution of the

crop changes occurs with great rapidity, for within twenty-four hours the temporary
'sebaceous glands' are loosened and cast off, the hypertrophied papillae which lie

between them being subsequently reduced. Such birds swallow their own ' milk ;

their villi contain more fat than normal birds, and fatty leucocytes are seen in

abundance in the blood.
     Some days, however, after separation, though the gross changes in the crop

membrane have disappeared, fatty cells are found in the epithelium.
     The ' milk' in the crops of such separated birds is also in finer particles than

normal and poorer in solid constituents.

   A few quantitative analyses, kindly made for me by my colleague Mr. F. J.

Hambly, are appended :

    2. On a Modification of Golgi's Methods. By Oliver S. Strong, of
                            Columbia College, New York.

     Golgi's methocls may be divided into two principal heads : (1) The sublimate

method, consistinp; essentially of hardening in bichromate of potash followed by
immersion in bichloride of mercury. This method need not be further noted here.

     (2) The silver methods, consisting of (a) the long, or slow, method, consisting
of hardening for about twenty to thirty days in potassium bichromate followed by
immersion in a solution of silver nitrate. (6) The rapid method, where the har-
dening is done in a mixture of bichromate and osmic acid. This is the method,
slightly modified, which is so extensively used, and is the method used by

E-amon y Cajal. (c) What may be designated the mixed method, or combined

method, and consists in hardening first for a few days or a week or so in potassium
bichromate, then a day or two in the osmium-bichromate mixture, and finally the
immersion in the silver bath.

     The rapid method is the best yet discovered for work on the peripheral ter-
minations of nerves and for the embryonic central nervous system. For adult
brains it is not so well adapted owing to the poor penetration of the osmic acid,
and consequent liability to overharden the periphery while the central portions of
even small pieces remain untouched. Moreover, adult brains are not well adapted
for the study of the nervous or axis cylinder prolongations of the cells, owinc
probably to their sheath, so that on such material study by these methods would
be chiefly directed to the cell bodies and their protoplasmic expansions. For
such purposes the long Golgi method is eminently adapted.

     While the long Golgi method avoids the disadvantages, including the expense

-- --no small consideration where such quantities are used of osmic acid, it has the

disadvantage of requiring about a month, besides the uncertainty common to all

these methods.

      In order to reduce this period of time, and yet to avoid the use of osmic acid, the

new method here proposed for the study of adult brains is the use of bichromate of
lithium instead of the bichromate of potassium, with the same percentages. I have

found that tissues (small pieces) placed in the former reach the favourable stao-e of

hardening for the silver impregnation in the course of one to two days, instead of
twenty to thirty days. It passes through this favourable period quite rapidly, but
the whole process is reduced to such a short time that it is rendered much less
tedious. The pictures yielded by this process, judging from the few made thus
far, are certainly fully equal to those prepared by the other methods.

     The subsequent treatment is as in the other methods, i.e., the piece of tissue

is rinsed in strong alcohol, cut free hand or gummed on a block without any

imbedding, and cut with a microtome. The sections are washed in several
changes of strong alcohol, cleared in oleum origanum Cretici, washed briefly in
xylol, and mounted in dammar or Canada balsam, thinned with xylol, without a

cover slip.

     It would be interesting to ascertain how well adapted this new hardening

reagent would be for preparing the central nervous sj'stem for other methods of
staining, e.g., the Weigert method.

3. On an Attempt to supply Motor Power to the Muscles of the Larynx from
    a New Source. By Veterinary-Captain F. Smith, F.R.C.V.S., F.I.C.,
    Army Veterinary Department, Aldershot.

     The subject used in these observations was the horse, the inquiry having in
view the possible relief of the respiratory distress so common in this animal as the

result of laryngeal paralysis.

     The new source of nerve supply was sought for in the spinal accessory. The
816 REPORT-- 1894.

recuiTeiit and spinal accessory were exposed and divided, and the proximal end
of tlie accessory was sutured to the distal end of the recurrent.

     The only convenient test which could be employed to ascertain what progress
the animal was making after the operation was that afforded by galloping it.

     In one case, a few months after the above nerves had been united, there was
only a slight harshness in the breathing during inspiration, even when the horse
was severely ' pressed ; ' whereas, unless nerve impulses were passing down the

accessory and through the recurrent to the larynx, the animal should have suffered
from intense dyspnoea, as the whole of the dilator muscles of one side of the larynx
would have been paralysed.

    In a second case, the recurrent, before suture to the accessory, was known to
have been degenerated for at least two years. This animal continued to have
noisy breathing up to the time it was destroyed (twelve months after the operation),

but it was unaccompanied by distress.
     In the first case only an ordinary post-mortem examination was made to

ascertain whether the nerves were united ; in the second horse the nerves were
stimulated electrically immediately after death, and a careful microscopical
examination of the parts made.

    On stimulating that portion of the recurrent in connection with the larynx

the muscles actively responded ; on stimulating the accessory well above the
nodule uniting it with the recurrent, the muscles of the larynx again actively
responded.

     These observations were repeated several times by Professor Delt5pine, of
Manchester (who kindly associated himself with me as an independent observer
in the, post-nwrttm examination), and the results are beyond doubt.

     The muscles of the larynx of the above case, supplied by the accessory-
recurrent nerve, were smaller and decidedly paler in colour than the healthy ones
on the opposite side ; on directly stimulating the muscles every portion of them
actively responded to a weak current.

     Professor Del6pine examined the united nerves microscopically, and found in
the recurrent between the point of union and the larynx small bundles of medul-

lated nerve fibres and an amount of epi- and peri-neurium larger than normal. The
place occupied by the old funiculi was quite distinct, but the nerve fibres occupied
only a portion of the spaces thus indicated. The nerve fibres were all of smaller
diameter than normal ; most of them had a very thin myelin sheath which stained
well with osmic acid. Professor Del^pine was of opinion from this and the other
observations that partial regeneration had certainly taken place, and that regenera-
tion was progressing at the time of death.

    By the tests employed it was not possible to say whether co-ordination of the

laryngeal muscles occurred, but it is proposed in future observations to examine
closely into this subject, and employ the laryngoscope to ascertain whether the
impulses to the larynx are sent at the right moment.

    At present it would almost appear to be possible to educate a nerve centre to

perform a duty it was never intended for.

4. On the Causes and Prevention of Suffocation in Mines. By J. S.

   Haldane, if. a., M.D., Lecturer on Physiology, University of Oxford.

     Evidence was brought forward by the author that most of the deaths caused
by colliery explosions and tires in the workings are due to suffocation, so that a
thorough investigation of the subject is of great practical importance.

    He concluded that poisoning Isy carbonic acid is never the cause of death ia

cases of suffocation by choke-damp, black-damp, or after-damp; that deprivation
of oxygen is always the cause in the cases of choke-damp or black-damp, and
usually the cause in the case of after-damp, although after-damp, even when

much diluted, is sometimes poisonous from the presence in it of products of in-
                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                                   817

complete combustion, such as carbonic oxide or sulphuretted hydrogen. He also

discussed the effects of white-damp, and drew attention to the exceedingly poisonous
character of the gases from the explosion of blasting powder.

     In conclusion he described and exhibited a portable apparatus for enabling
miners to escape through an atmosphere of after-damp to the fresh air in the
2ieighbourhood of the shafts, and for rescue purposes.

                              By J. Shaw Lyttle, M.D.

    The writer gave a detailed account of the symptoms presented by those who

were found alive after the recent explosion at the Albion Steam Colliery.

6. Experiments on Memory. By W. G. Smith, 31. A., Ph.D.

If we examine any case of ready and accurate recollection taken from our daily

experience, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to say how much of this accuracy

is due to such factors as the interest which the experience aroused, the attention

which we paid to it, the amount of effort and time spent during the experience.

The following experiments were carried out with the view of trying to isolate

experimentally the process of attention, and showing what changes in recollection

occur when various kinds of distraction of attention are introduced. The experi-

ments were begun in the Institute for Experimental Psychology in Leipzig, and

have been carried on in the Physiological Laboratory in Oxford.

After a considerable number of preliminary experiments had been made, the

following method was adopted. Twelve letters of the alphabet, arranged in such

a manner that intelligible words or interesting ideas should not readily be sug-

gested, were written upon a card, so as to form three lines. The card was shown

to the reagent, who then tried to learn what was written on it. In each new

experiment a new combination of letters was employed. By making a sufficiently

large number of observations with different persons, one can eliminate to a con-

siderable extent the fallacies arising from varying difficulty or familiarity of the

combinations employed. The card was shown in every case for ten seconds, and

the reagent was required, either immediately after he ceased to see the card or after

an interval of about two seconds, to reproduce as much as he could remember of

what he had seen.

   A distinct and at the same time fairly simple form of distraction was secured

by making the reagent repeat the series 2, 4, 6, 8 . . . , or more rarely 3, 6, 9 ... ,
while he was learning the letters on the card. In order that the person in charge

of the experiments might have an effective control over the activity of the reagent,

the series had to be repeated aloud, and each step in the addition was made to

coincide with the stroke of a metronome going at the rate of sixty to seventy beats

per minute. In order to compare the results of this form of distraction with those

gained where the vocal organ was employed, but the mental effort involved was

very small, the reagent was next required while memorising to repeat aloud with

each beat of the nietronome an unintelligible syllable, e.g., ' la.' This form of

distraction was further compared with that caused by activity of another set of

muscles, viz., those employed in tapping the table with the forefinger, each tap

coinciding with a beat of the metronome. Lastly, experiments were carried out

to show the effect of memorising without any distraction save that due to the fact

that the metronome continued to beat. These four variations were given in varying

order one after the other, and were so arranged that 8, 12, IG, or 20 experiments
were made in one hour.

In calculating the value of the results two methods were applied. The first

reeembles that employed by Miinsterberg ('Beitriigo zur experimentellen Psycho-

logie'), and consists in summing up the errors committed in reproducing the

--letters written on the card. The errors were classified as follows: (1) Omission
of a letter                                        (2) insertion of a  wrong                                (3) displacement of a letter or repro-
                                                ;                             letter
                                                                                                         ;

duction in wrong order. Accordino' to the second method, which resemhles that

commonly employed in estimating the value of answers to examination papers, a

greater value is assigned to letters according as they correspond more exactly to

Awhat was written on the card.    letter which was given in a wrong position or

without any hint as to its position had the value 1 attached to it. When a certain

imperfect knowledge of its position was present, as when it was located in the right

line or in the right order in a group of letters whose correct position was unknown,

the value 2 was given. Each letter counted .'i when everything was correct.

Letters wrongly inserted were disregarded. From an analysis of the results given

by the first method it appeared that the number of insertions does not vary very

much, and only in a few cases lias an important influence on the results.

All the results of over five hundred experiments made with nine observers have

been analysed according to the two methods, and the results agree except in a few

cases.

     The general conclusion is that the memory is worst when the reagent perform.^
the simple sum in addition (1); it is better when the distraction is caused by
exercise of the vocal organ (2) ; that caused by movement of the forefinger (3)
does not make the recollection much worse than it is when the observer is not

distracted at all (4). This statement holds good with only a few exceptions for

every reagent, and is confirmed by the subjective observations given in reply to the
questions which were frequently asked. The average of the results given by the

nine persons who assisted in the experiments is as follows : the upper line gives

the values according to the first method, the lower the values according to the

second method of calculation
