 Recommendations adopted by the General Committee at the Cam-
                              bridge Meeting in June 1845.

           Involving Applications to Government and Public Institutions.

                 magnetical and meteorological observatories.

                     Resolutions adopted hy the Magnetic Conference.

   1. That the Magnetic Observatory at Greenwich be permanently con-
tinued, upon the most extensive and efficient scale that the interests of the
Sciences of Magnetism and Meteorology may require.

   2. That it be earnestly recommended to the Provost and Fellows of
Trinity College, Dublin, to continue the Magnetical and Meteorological Ob-
servations at the Observatory instituted by that University.

   3. That it be recommended to continue the Observatory at Toronto upon
its present footing until the 31st of December 1848, unless in the mean time
arrangements can be made for its permanent establishment.

   4. That it be recommended to continue the Observatory at Van Diemen's
Land until the 31st of December 1848, unless in the mean time arrange-
ments can be made for its permanent establishment.

   5. That it be recommended that the Observatory at St. Helena should be
continued upon its present establishment for a period terminating on the 31st
of December 1848, for special Meteorological objects.

   6. That it be recommended that the building and materials of the Mag-
netical and Meteorological Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope should

be transferred to the Astronomical Observatory there, to which an Assistant.
should be added, for the purpose of making absolute Magnetical Determi-

nations.

    7. That it be recommended to the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, that the Observatories of Simla and Singapore be discontinued at
the end of the present year ; but that the Magnetic and Meteorological
Observations now made at Bombay and Madras be permanently continued
in connexion with the Astronomical Observations at these Stations, and that
it be further recommended to the Court of Directors, to sanction the pro-
posal made by Mr. Elliot, for a Magnetic Survey of the Indian Seas, to
commence at the close of the present year.

    8. That it be recommended that the Canadian Survey be continued until
the connexion of Toronto with the American Stations be completed.
                                                                --

--Xvi REPORT 1845.

    9. That it be recommended that advantage should be taken of every op-
portunity of extending Magnetic Surveys in regions not hitherto surveyed,
and in the neighbourhood of Magnetic Observatories.

    10. That it be strongly recommended that the Staff of Colonel Sabine's
establishment at Woolwich be maintained, with such an increased force as
may cause the observations which have been made, and those which shall
hereafter be made, to be reduced and published with all possible expe-

dition.

    11. That this Meeting have recommended the reduction of the Establish-
ments at present attached to some of the Magnetical and Meteorological
Observatories, in the full confidence that if, after careful discussion of the
Observations made to the end of 1845, there should appear to be reason for
restoring some of those Establishments, and for forming new ones, the
British Government and the East India Company will give their aid with the
same liberality which they have displayed in the maintenance of the existing

Observatories.

    12. That the cordial cooperation which has hitherto prevailed between
the British and Foreign Magnetic and Meteorological Observatories, having
produced the most important results, and being considered by us as abso-
lutely essential to tlie success of the great system of combined observation
which has been undertaken, it is earnestly recommended that the same spirit
of cooperation should continue to prevail ; and that the President of the
British Association be requested to make application to the British Govern-
ment, to convey the expression of this opinion to the Governments of those
other countries which have already taken part in the Observations.

   13. The British Association, assembled at Cambridge, cannot permit the
proceedings of this Meeting to terminate without expressing their sense of
great obligation to the eminent Foreign Gentlemen who have taken part in
the discussions of the Conference, and whose unwearied attention has been
most effectively bestowed on every part of the proceedings.

   14. That the Committee which has hitherto conducted the cooperation of
the British Association, in the system of combined observations, be re-
appointed, for the purpose of preparing a report to accompany the presenta-
tion to the British Government and to the Directors of the East India Com-
pany, of the resolutions passed at this Meeting, and that the

Marquis of Northampton,                   Professor Christie, and
Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,                  Professor J. D. Forbes,

be added to the Committee.

Resolved, in conformity with the express opinion of the Magnetic Con-
    ference, sanctioned by the Committee of Recommendations

" That it is highly desirable to encourage by specific pecuniary reward the

improvement of  Self-recording  Magnetical 'and Meteorological  Apparatus
                                                                                                          ;

and that

                The President of the British Association, and

                The President of the Royal Society,

be requested to solicit the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Go-
vernment to this subject."

                                GEOLOGY.

   That the President of the British Association cooperate with the President
of the Royal Society, the President of the Geological Society, the President

of the Royal Asiatic Society, Sir H. T. De la Beche, the Rev. Dr. Buck-

                 ADDRESS

       SIR JOHN F. W. HERSCHEL, BART., F.R.S.,

                                                       &c. &c.

--Gentlemen, The terms of kindness in which I have been introduced to

your notice by my predecessor in the office which you have called on me to

--fill, have been gratifying to me in no common degree not as contributing

to the excitement of personal vanity (a feeling which the circumstances in

which I stand, and the presence of so many individuals every way my su-

periors, must tend powerfully to chastise), but as the emanation of a friend-
ship begun at this University when we were youths together, preparing for
our examinations for degrees, and contemplating each other, perhaps, with
some degree of rivalry (if that can be called rivalry from which every spark

of jealous feeling is absent). That friendship has since continued, warm and
unshadowed for a single instant by the slightest cloud of disunion, and among
all the stirring and deep-seated remembrances which the sight of these walls
within which we are now assembled arouse, I can summon none more every
way delightful and cheering than the contemplation of that mutual regard.
It is, therefore, with no common feelings that I find myself now placed in
this chair, as the representative of such a body as the British Association,
and as the successor of such a friend and of such a man as its late President.

   Gentlemen, there are many sources of pride and satisfaction, in which
self has no place, which crowd upon a Cambridge man in revisiting for a
second time this University, as the scene of our annual labours. The de-
velopment of its material splendour which has taken place in that interval
of twelve years, vast and noble as it has been, has been more than kept pace
with by the triumphs of its intellect, the progress of its system of instruction,
and the influence of that progress on the public mind and the state of science

--in England. When I look at the scene around me when I see the way in

which our Sections are officered in so many instances by Cambridge men,
not out of mere compliment to the body which receives us, but for the in-
trinsic merit of the men, and the pre-eminence which the general voice of

--society accords them in their several departments when I think of the large

proportion of the muster-roll of science which is filled by Cambridge names,
and when, without going into any details, and confining myself to only one
branch of public instruction, I look back to the vast and extraordinary de-
velopment in the state of mathematical cultivation and power in this Uni-
versity, as evidenced both in its examinations and in the published works of

--its members, noW, as compared with what it was in my own time I am left

at no loss to account for those triumphs and that influence to which I have
alluded. It has ever been, and I trust it ever will continue to be, the pride
and boast of this University to maintain, at a conspicuously high level, that
sound and thoughtful and sobering discipline of mind which mathematical
studies imply. Independent of the power which such studies confer as in-
struments of investigation, there never was a period in the history of science
xxviii  --REPORT 1845.

in which their moral influence, if I may so term it, was more needed, as a

corrective to that propensity which is begiiming to prevail Avidely, and, I fear,

bale fully, over large departments of our philosophy, the propensity to crude

and over-hasty generalization. To all such propensities the steady concentra-
tion of thought, and its fixation on the clear and the definite which a long and

stern mathematical discipline imparts, is the best, and, indeed, the only proper

antagonist. That such habits of thought exist, and characterize, in a pre-
eminent degree, the discipline of this University, with a marked influence on
the subsequent career of those who have been thoroughly imbued with it, is

a matter of too great notoriety to need proof. Yet, in illustration of this

disposition, I may be allowed to mention one or two features of its Scientific
History, which seem to me especially worthy of notice on this occasion. The
first of these is the institution of the Cambridge University Philosophical
Society, that body at whose more especial invitation we are now here as-
sembled, which has now subsisted for more than twenty years, and which has
been a powerful means of cherishing and continuing those habits among

resident members of the University, after the excitement of reading for
academical honours is past. From this Society have emanated eight or nine
volumes of memoirs, full of variety and interest, and such as no similar col-

lection, originating as this has done in the bosom, and, in great measure,
within the walls of an academical institution, can at all compare with ; the

Memoirs of the Ecole Polytechnique of Paris, perhaps, alone excepted.
"Without under-valuing any part of this collection, 1 may be allowed to par-
ticularize, as adding largely to our stock of knowledge of their respective

--subjects, the Hydro-dynamical contributions of Prof. Challis the Optical
--and Photological papers of Mr. Airy those of Mr. Murphy on Definite
--Integrals the curious speculations and intricate mathematical investigations
--of Mr. Hopkins on Geological Dynamics and, more recently, the papers

of Mr. De Morgan on the foundations of Algebra, which, taken in conjunc-
tion with the prior researches of the Dean of Ely and Mr. Warren on the

geometrical interpretation of imaginary symbols in that science, have effectu-
ally dissipated every obscurity which heretofore prevailed on this subject.
The elucidation of the metaphysical difficulties in question, by this remark-
able train of speculation, has, in fact, been so complete, that henceforward
they will never be named as difficulties, but only as illustrations of principle.
Nor does its interest end here, since it appears to have given rise to the theory

of Quaternions of Sir W. Hamilton, and to the Triple Algebra of Mr. De

Morgan himself, as well as to a variety of interesting inquiries of a similar
nature on the part of Mr. Graves, Mr. Cayley, and others. Conceptions of

--a novel and refined kind have thus been introduced into analysis new forms
--of imaginary expression rendered familiar and a vein opened which I can-

not but believe will terminate in some first-rate discovery in abstract science.
    Neither are inquiries into the logic of symbolic analysis, conducted as these

have been, devoid of a bearing on the progress even of physical science.
Every inquiry, indeed, has such a bearing which teaches us that terms which

we use in a narrow sphere of experience, as if we fully understood them,
may, as our knowledge of nature increases, come to have superadded to them
a new set of meanings and a wider range of interpretation. It is thus that
modes of action and communication, which we hardly yet feel prepared to
regard as strictly of a material character, may, ere many years have passed,
come to be familiarly included in our notions of Light, Heat, Electricity and

--other agents of this class ; and that the transference of physical causation

 from point to point in space nay, even the generation or development of
attractive, repulsive or directive forces at their points of arrival may come to

be enumerated among their properties. The late marvellous discoveries in
                                ADDRESS.           XXIX

actino-chemistry and the phsenomena of muscular contraction as dependent
on the will, are, perhaps, even now preparing us for the reception of ideas of

this kind.

   Another instance of the efficacy of the course of study in this University,
in producing not merely expert algebraists, but sound and original mathema-
tical thinkers (and, perhaps, a more striking one, from the generality of its
contributors being men of comparatively junior standing), is to be found in

the publication of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, of which already

four volumes, full of very original communications, are before the public. It
was set on foot in 1837, by the late Mr. Gregory, Fellow of Trinity College,
whose premature death has bereft science of one who, beyond a doubt, had

he lived, would have proved one of its chief ornaments, and the worthy re-

presentative of a family already so distinguished in the annals of mathemati-

cal and optical science. His papers on the ' Calculus of Operations ' which

appeared in that collection, fully justifies this impression, while they afford

myan excellent illustration of  general position.  Nor ought I to omit men-

tioning the Chemical Society, of whom he was among the founders, as indica-

tive of the spirit of the place, untrammeled by abstract forms, and eager to
spread itself over the whole field of human inquiry.

Another great and distinguishing feature in the scientific history of this

place, is the establishment of its Astronomical Observatory, and the regular
publication of the observations made in it. The science of Astronomy is so
vast, and its objects so noble, that the practical study of it for its own sake is
quite sufficient to ensure its pursuit wherever civilization exists. But such in-
stitutions have a much wider influence than that which they exercise in for-
warding their immediate object. Every astronomical observatory which

publishes its observations becomes a nucleus for the formation around it of a

--school of exact practice a standing and accessible example of the manner
--in which theories are brought to their extreme test a centre, from which

emanate a continual demand for and suggestion of refinements, delicacies,

and precautions in matters of observation and apparatus which re-act upon

the whole body of science, and stimulate, while they tend to render possible

an equal refinement and precision in all its processes. It is impossible to
speak too highly of the mode in which the business of this institution is carried

on under its present eminent director ; nor can it be forgotten in our ap-

preciation of what it has done for science, that in it our present Astronomer

Royal first proved and familiarized himself with that admirable system of

astronomical observation, registry, and computation, which he has since

brought to perfection in our great national observatory, and which have ren-

dered it, under his direction, the pride and ornament of British science, and

the admiration of Europe.

    Gentlemen, I should never have done if I were to enlarge on, or even at-
tempt to enumerate the many proofs which this University has afforded of its
determination to render its institutions and endowments efficient for the pur-
poses of public instruction, and available to science. But such encomiums,

however merited, must not be allowed to encroach too largely on other objects
which I propose to bring before your notice, and which relate to the more

immediate business of the present meeting, and to the general interests of
science. The first and every way the most important, is the subject of the
Magnetic and Meteorological Observatories. Every member of this Associa-

tion is, of course, aware of the great exertions which have been made during

the last five years, on the part of the British, Russian, and several other foreign
governments, and of our own East India Company, to furnish data on the
most extensive and systematic scale, for elucidating the great problems of

Terrestrial Magnetism and Meteorology, by the establishment of a system of
--XXX REPORT 1845.

observatories all over the world, in which the phaenomena are registered at

instants strictly simultaneous, and at intervals of two hours throughout both
day and night. With the particulars of these national institutions, and of
the multitude of local and private ones of a similar nature, both in Europe,
Asia, and America, working on the same concerted plan, so far as the means
at their disposal enable them, I need not detain you : neither need I enter
into any detailed explanation of the system of Magnetic Surveys, both by sea
and land, which have been executed or are in progress, in connexion with,
and based upon the observations carried on at the fixed stations. These
things form the subject of Special Annual Reports, which the Committee
appointed for the purpose have laid before us at our several meetings, ever
since the commencement of the undertaking ; and the most recent of which

will be read in the Physical Section of the present meeting, in its regular

course. It is sufficient for me to observe, that the result has been the accu-
mulation of an enormous mass of most valuable observations, which are now
and have been for some time in the course of publication ; and when thoroughly

digested and discussed, as they are sure to be, by the talent and industry of
magnetists and meteorologists, both in this country and abroad, cannot fail
to place those sciences very far indeed in advance of their actual state. For
such discussion, however, time must be allowed. Even were all the returns
from the several observatories before the public (which they are not, and are
very far from being), such is the mass of matter to be grappled with, and such
the multitude of ways in which the observations will necessarily have to be
grouped and combined to elicit mean results and quantitative laws, that several
years must elapse before the full scientific value of the work done can pos-

sibly be realized.

   Meanwhile, a question of the utmost moment arises, and which must be

resolved, so far as the British Association is concerned, before the breaking-

up of this meeting. The second term of three years, for which the British

-- --Government and the East India Company have granted their establishments
   nine in number will terminate with the expiration of the current year, at
which period, if no provision be made for their continuance, the observations
at those establishments will of course cease, and with them, beyond a doubt,

-- --those at a great many probably the great majority of the foreign establish-

ments, both national and local, which have been called into existence by the
example of England, and depend on that example for their continuance or
abandonment. Now, under these circumstances, it becomes a very grave
subject for the consideration of our Committee of Recommendations, whether,
to suffer this term to expire without an effort on the part of this Association
to influence the Government for its continuance, or whether, on the other
hand, we ought to make such an effort, and endeavour to secure either the
continuance of these establishments for a further limited term, or the per-
petuity of this or some equivalent system of observation in the same or dif-
ferent localities, according to the present and future exigencies of science.
I term this a grave subject of deliberation, and one which will call for the
exercise of their soundest judgement ; because, in the first place, this system of
combined observation is by far the greatest and most prolonged effort of
scientific co-operation which the world has ever witnessed ; because, moreover,
the spirit in which the demands of science have been met on this occasion
by our own Government, by the Company, and by the other governments
who have taken part in the matter, has been, in the largest sense of the words,
munificent and unstinting ; and because the existence of such a spirit throws
upon us a solemn responsibility to recommend nothing but upon the most
entire conviction of very great evils consequent on the interruption, and very

great benefits to accrue to science from the continuance of the observations.
ADDRESS.  XXXI

   Happily we are not left without the means of forming a sound judgement
on this momentous question. It is a case in which, connected as the science
of Britain is with that of the other co-operating nations, we cannot and ought
not to come to any conclusion without taking into our counsels the most
eminent magnetists and meteorologists of other countries who have either
taken a direct part in the observations, or whose reputation in those sciences
is such as to give their opinions, in matters respecting them, a commanding
weight. Accordingly it was resolved, at the York meeting Icist year, to invite

the attendance of the eminent individuals I have alluded to at this meeting,

with the especial object of conference on the subject. And in the interval

since elapsed, knowing the improbability of a complete personal reunion from
so many distant quarters, a circular has been forwarded to each of them,
proposing certain special questions for reply, and inviting, besides, the fullest
and freest communication of their views on the general subject. The replies
received to this circular, which are numerous and in the highest degree in-
teresting and instructive, have been printed and forwarded to the parties

replying, with a request for their reconsideration and further communication,

and have also been largely distributed at home to every member of our own
Council, and the Committee of Recommendations, and to each member of
the Council and Physical Committee of the Royal Society, which, conjointly
with ourselves, memorialized Government for the establishment of the ob-

servatories.

   In addition to the valuable matter thus communicated, I am happy to add,

that several of the distinguished foreigners in question have responded to our
invitation, and that in consequence this meeting is honoured by the personal

presence of M. Kupffer, the Director-General of the Russian System of Mag-
netic and Meteorological Observation ; of M. Ermann, the celebrated circum-
navigator and meteorologist ; of Baron von Senftenberg, the founder of the

Astronomical, Magnetic, and Meteorological Observatory of Senftenberg ; of

M. Kreil, the director of the Imperial Observatory at Prague ; and of M.

Boguslawski, director of the Royal Prussian Observatory of Breslau, all of

whom have come over for the express purpose of affording us the benefit of
their advice and experience in this discussion. To all the conferences be-
tween these eminent foreigners and our own Magnetic and Meteorological

Committee, and such of our members present as have taken any direct theo-
retical or practical interest in the subjects, all the members of our Committee
 of Recommendations will have free access for the purpose of enabling them
 fully to acquaint themselves with the whole bearing of the case, and the ar-
 guments used respecting all the questions to be discussed, so that when the
 subject comes to be referred to them, as it must be if the opinion of the con-
ference should be favourable to the continuance of the system, they may be
 fully prepared to make up their minds on it.

     I will not say one word from this chair which can have the appearance of
 in any way anticipating the conclusion which the conference thus organized
 may come to, or the course to be adopted in consequence. But I will take

 this opportunity of stating my ideas generally on the position to be assumed

 by this Association and by other scientific bodies in making demands on the
 national purse for scientific purposes. And 1 will also state, quite irrespective
 of the immediate question of magnetic co-operation, and therefore of the fate
 of this particular measure, what I conceive to be the objects which might be
 accomplished, and ought to be aimed at in the establishment of physical
 OBSERVATORIES, as part of the integrant institutions of each nation calling
 itself civilized, and as its contribution to Terrestrial Physics.

    It is the pride and boast of an Englishman to pay his taxes cheerfully when
 he feels assured of their application to great and worthy objects. And as
xxxii  REPORT-- 1845.

civilization advances, we feel constantly more and more strongly, that, after

the great objects of national defence, the stability of our institutions, the due
administration of justice, and the healthy maintenance of our social state, are

--provided for, there is no object greater and more noble none more worthy
--of national effort than the furtherance of science. Indeed, there is no surer

test of the civilization of an age or nation than the degree in which this con-

viction is felt. Among Englishmen it has been for a long time steadily in-
creasing, and may now be regarded as universal among educated men of all
classes. No government, and least of all a British government, can be in-

sensible to the general prevalence of a sentiment of this kind ; and it is our
good fortune, and has been so for several years, to have a government, (no
matter what its denomination as respects party), impressible with such con-
siderations, and really desirous to aid the forward struggle of intellect by

placing at its disposal the material means of its advances.

   But to do so with effect, it is necessary to be thoroughly well-informed.
The mere knowledge that such a disposition exists, is sufficient to surround

those in power with every form of extravagant pretension. And even if this
were not so, the number of competing claims, which cannot be all satisfied,

can only harass and bewilder, unless there be somewhere seated a discrimi-
nating and selecting judgement, which, among many important claims, shall
fix upon the most important, and urge them with the weight of well-esta-
blished character. I know not where such a selecting judgement can be so
confidently looked for as in the great scientific bodies of the country, each

in its own department, and in this Association, constituted, in great measure,
out of, and so representing them all, and numbering besides, among its mem-
bers, abundance of men of excellent science and enlightened minds who be-
long to none of them. The constitution of sucii a body is the guarantee both
for the general soundness of its recommendations, and for the due weighing

of their comparative importance, should ever the claims of different branches

of science come into competition with each other.
    In performing this most important office of suggesting channels through

which the fertilizing streams of national munificence can be most usefully
conveyed over the immense and varied fields of scientific culture, it be-
comes us, in the first place, to be so fully impressed with a sense of duty
to the great cause for which we are assembled, as not to hesitate for an instant
in making a recommendation of whose propriety we are satisfied, on them ere
ground that the aid required is of great and even of unusual magnitude.

And on the other hand, keeping within certain reasonable limits of total

amount, which each individual must estimate for himself, and which it would
be unwise and indeed impossible to express in terms, it will be at once felt
that economy in asking is quite as high a " distributive virtue " as economy in
granting, and that every pound recommended unnecessarily is so mueh cha-
racter thrown away. I make these observations because the principles they
contain cannot be too frequently impressed, and by no means because I con-

sider them to have been overstepped in any part of our conduct hitherto. In
the next place, it should be borne in mind that, in recommending to Govern-
ment, not a mere grant of money, but a scientific enterprise or a national

establishment, whether temporary or permanent, not only is it our duty so to

place it before them that its grounds of recommendation shall be thoroughly

intelligible, but that its whole proposed extent shall be seen ; or at least if

that cannot be, that it should be clearly stated to be the possible commence-
ment of something more extensive ; and besides, that the printing and publi-
cation of results should, in every such case, be made an express part of the
recommendation. And, again, we must not forget that our interest in the

matter does not cease with such publication. It becomes our duty to forward,
                                                                         ;

--by every encouragement in our power, the due consideration and scientific

discussion of results so procured to urge it upon the science of our own

country and of Europe, and to aid from our own resources those who may be

willing to charge themselves with their analysis, and direct or execute the

numerical computations or graphical projections it may involve. This is ac-

tually the predicament in which we stand, in reference to the immense mass

of data already accumulated by the magnetic and meteorological observa-

tories. Let the science of England, and especially the rising and vigorous

mind which is pressing onward to distinction, gird itself to the work of grap-

pling with this mass. Let it not be said that we are always to look abroad

whenever industry and genius are required, to act in union for the discussion

of great masses of raw observation. Let us take example from what we see

going on in Germany, where a Dove, a Kamtz and a Mahlmann are battling

with the meteorology, a Gauss, a Weber and an Ermann with the magnetism

of the world. The mind of Britain is equal to the task; its mathematical

strength, developed of late years to an unprecedented extent, is competent to

any theoretical analysis or technical combination. Nothing is wanting but

the resolute and persevering devotion of undistracted thought to a single ob-

ject, and that will not be long wanting when once the want is declared and

dwelt upon, and the high prize of public estimation held forth to those who

fairly and freely adventure themselves in this career. Never was there a

time when the mind of the country, as well as its resources of every kind,

answered so fully and readily to any call reasonable in itself and properly

urged upon it. Do we call for facts ? they are poured upon us in such pro-

fusion as for a time to overwhelm us, like the Roman maid who sank under

the load of wealth she called down upon herself. Witness the piles of un-

reduced meteorological observations which load our shelves and archives

witness the immense and admirably arranged catalogues of stars which have

been and still are pouring in from all quarters upon our astronomy so soon

as the want of extensive catalogues came to be felt and declared. What we

now want is thought, steadily directed to single objects, with a determination

--to eschew the besetting evil of our age the temptation to squander and di-

lute it upon a thousand different lines of inquiry. The philosopher must be

wedded to his subject if he would see the children and the children's children

of his intellect flourishing in honour around him.

The establishment of astronomical observatories has been, in all ages and

nations, the first public recognition of science as an integrant part of civili-

zation. Astronomy, however, is only one out of many sciences, which can

be advanced by a combined system of observation and calculation carried on
uninterruptedly ; where, in the way of experiment, man has no control, and

whose only handle is the continual observation of Nature as it developes

itself under our eyes, and a constant collateral endeavour to concentrate the

records of that observation into empirical laws in the first instance, and to

ascend from those laws to theories. Speaking in a utilitarian point of view,

the globe which we inhabit is quite as important a subject of scientific inquiry

Weas the stars.  depend for our bread of life and every comfort on its cli-

Wemates and seasons, on the movements of its winds and waters.  guide

ourselves over the ocean, when astronomical observations fail, by our know-

ledge of the laws of its magnetism ; we learn the sublimest lessons from the

records of its geological history; and the great facts which its figure,

magnitude, and attraction, offer to mathematical inquiry, form the very basis
of Astronomy itself. Terrestrial Physics, therefore, form a subject every way

worthy to be associated with Astronomy as a matter of universal interest and

public support, and one which cannot be adequately studied except in the

--way in which Astronomy itself has been by permanent establishments
                                                                --

--keeping up an unbroken series of observation : but with tliis difference, that

whereas the chief data of Astronomy might be supplied by the establishment

--of a very few well-worked observatories properly dispersed in the two hemi-

spheres the gigantic problems of meteorology, magnetism, and oceanic
movements can only be resolved by a far more extensive geographical dis-

tribution of observing stations, and by a steady, persevering, systematic attack,

to which every civilized nation, as it has a direct interest in the result, ought

to feel bound to contribute its contingent.

   I trust that the time is not far distant when such will be the case, and when
no nation calling itself civilized will deem its institutions complete without

the establishment of a permanent physical observatory, with at least so much

provision for astronomical and magnetic observation as shall suffice to make

--it a local centre of reference for geographical determinations and trigono-

metrical and magnetic surveys which latter, if we are ever to attain to a

theory of the secular changes of the earth's magnetism, vvill have to be re-

peated at intervals of twenty or thirty years for a long while to come. Ra-

pidly progressive as our colonies are, and emulous of the civilization of the

mother country, it seems not too much to hope from them, that they should

take upon themselves, each according to its means, the establishment and

maintenance of such institutions both for their own advantage and improve-

Ament, and as their contributions to the science of the world.  noble ex-

ample has been set them in this respect, within a very few months, by our

colony of British Guiana, in which a society recently constituted, in the best

spirit of British co-operation, has established and endowed an observatory of
this very description, furnishing it partly from their own resources and partly

by the aid of government, with astronomical, magnetic, and meteorological

--instruments, and engaging a competent observer at a handsome salary to work

the establishment an example which deserves to be followed wherever British

enterprise has struck root and flourished.

   The perfectly unbroken and normal registry of all the meteorological and

--magnetic elements and of tidal fluctuations where the locality admits

would form the staple business of every such observatory, and, according to

its means of observation, periodical phaenomena of every description would

claim attention, for which the list supplied by M. Quetelet, which extends

not merely to the phases of inanimate life, but to their effects on the animal

and vegetable creation, will leave us at no loss beyond the difficulty of selec-

tion. The division of phaenomena which magnetic observation has suggested

into periodical, secular, and occasional, will apply mutatis mutandis to every

department. Under the head of occasional phaenomena, storms, magnetic

disturbances, auroras, extraordinary tides, earthquake movements, meteors,

&c., would supply an ample field of observation ; while among the secular

changes, indications of the varying level of land and sea would necessitate the

establishment of permanent marks, and the reference to them of the actual

mean sea level which would emerge from a series of tidal observations, carried

round a complete period of the moon's nodes with a certainty capable of de-

tecting the smallest changes.

The abridgement of the merely mechanical work of such observatories by

self-registering apparatus, is a subject which cannot be too strongly insisted

on. Neither has the invention of instruments for superseding the necessity

of much arithmetical calculation by the direct registry of total effects re-

ceived anything like the attention it deserves. Considering the perfection to

which mechanism has arrived in all its departments, these contrivances pro-

mise to become of immense utility. The more the merely mechanical part

of the observer's duty can be alleviated, the more will he be enabled to apply

himself to the theory of his subject, and to perform what I conceive ought to
                                                                            --

be regarded as the most important of all his duties, and which in time will

--come to be universally so considered I mean the systematic deduction from

the registered observations of the mean values and local co-efficients of di-

urnal, menstrual, and annual change. These deductions, in the case of per-

manent institutions, ought not, if possible, to be thrown upon the public, and

their effective execution would be the best and most honourable test of the

zeal and ability of their directors.

   Nothing damps the ardour of an observer like the absence of an object

appreciable and attainable by himself. One of my predecessors in this chair

has well remarked, that a man may as well keep a register of his dreams as

of the weather, or any other set of daily phaenomena, if the spirit of grouping,

combining, and eliciting results be absent. It can hardly be expected, indeed,,

that observers of facts of this nature should themselves reason from them up

to the highest theories. For that their position unfits them, as they see but

locally and partially. But no other class of persons stands in anything like

so favourable a position for working out the first elementary laws of phaeno-

mena, and referring them to their immediate points of dependence. Those

who witness their daily progress, with that interest which a direct object in

view inspires, have in this respect an infinite advantage over those who have

Ato go over the same ground in the form of a mass of dry figures.  thou-

sand suggestions arise, a thousand improvements occur-»-a spirit of inter-

change of ideas is generated, the surrounding district is laid under contribu-

tion for the elucidation of innumerable points, where a chain of corre-

sponding observation is desirable ; and what would otherwise be a scene of

irksome routine, becomes a school of physical science. It is needless to say

how much such a spirit must be excited by the institution of provincial and

colonial scientific societies, like that which I have just had occasion to men-

tion. Sea as well as land observations are, however, equally required for the

Aeffectual working out of these great physical problems.  ship is an itinerant

observatory ; and, in spite of its instability, one which enjoys several eminent

--advantages in the uniform level and nature of the surface, which eliminate

a multitude of causes of disturbance and uncertainty, to which land observa-

tions are liable. The exceeding precision with which magnetic observations

can be made at sea, has been abundantly proved in the Antarctic Voyage of

Sir James Ross, by which an invaluable mass of data has been thus secured

to science. That voyage has also conferred another and most important ac-

cession to our knowledge in the striking discovery of a permanently low

barometric pressure in high south latitudes over the whole Antarctic ocean

a pressure actually inferior by considerably more than an inch of mercury, to

Awhat is found between the Tropics.   fact so novel and remarkable will of

course give rise to a variety of speculations as to its cause ; and I anticipate

one of the most interesting discussions which have ever taken place in our

Physical Section, should that great circumnavigator favour us, as I hope he

will, with a viva voce account of it. The voyage now happily commenced

under the most favourable auspices for the further prosecution of our Arctic

discoveries under Sir John Franklin, will bring to the test of direct experiment

a mode of accounting for this extraordinary phaenoraenon thrown out by

Colonel Sabine, which, if realized, will necessitate a complete revision of our

whole system of barometric observation in high latitudes, and a total recon-

struction of all our knowledge of the laws of pressure in regions where ex-

cessive cold prevails. This, with the magnetic survey of the Arctic seas, and

the not improbable solution of the great geographical problem which forms

the chief object of the expedition, will furnish a sufficient answer to those,

if any there be, who regard such voyages as useless. Let us hope and pray,

that it may please Providence to shield him and his brave companions from

the many dangers of their enterprise, and restore them in health and honour

to their country.
   I cannot quit this subject without reverting to and deploring the great loss

which science has recently sustained in the death of the late Prof. Daniell,
one of its most eminent and successful cultivators in this country. His work
on Meteorology is, if I mistake not, the first in which the distinction between
the aqueous and gaseous atmospheres, and their mutual independence, was
clearly and strongly insisted on as a highly influential element in meteorolo-
gical theory. Every succeeding investigation has placed this in a clearer

light. In the hands of M. Dove, and more recently of Colonel Sabine, it has
proved the means of accounting for some of the most striking features in the
diurnal variations of the barometer. The continual generation of the aqueous
atmosphere at the Equator, and its destruction in high latitudes, furnishes a wo-
tive power in meteorology, whose mode of action, and the mechanism through
which it acts, have yet to be inquired into. Mr. Daniell's claims to scientific

distinction were, however, not confined to this branch. In his hands, the
voltaic pile became an infinitely more powerful and manageable instrument
than had ever before been thought possible ; and his improvements in its
construction (the effect not of accident, but of patient and persevering experi-

mental inquiry), have in effect changed the face of Electro-Chemistry. Nor
did he confine himself to these improvements. He applied them : and among
the last and most interesting inquiries of his life, are a series of electro-che-
mical researches which may rank with the best things yet produced in that

line.

   The immediate importance of these subjects to one material part of our
business at this meeting, has caused me to dwell more at length than perhaps I
otherwise should on them. I would gladly use what time may remain without
exciting your impatience, in taking a view of some features in the present
state and future prospects of that branch of science to which my own attention
has been chiefly directed, as well as to some points in the philosophy of
science generally, in which it appears to me that a disposition is becoming

pi-evalent towards lines of speculation, calculated rather to bewilder than
enlighten, and, at all events, to deprive the pursuit of science of that which,
to a rightly constituted mind,mustever beone of its highest and most attractive
sources of interest, by reducing it to a mere assemblage of marrowless and
meaningless facts and laws.

   The last year must ever be considered an epoch in astronomy, from its

having witnessed the successful completion of the Earl of Rosse's six-feet

--reflector an achievement of such magnitude, both in itself as a means of

discovery, and in respect of the difficulties to be surmounted in its construc-
tion (difficulties which perhaps few persons here present are better able from

experience to appreciate than myself), that I want words to express my ad-

 miration of it. I have not myself been so fortunate as to have witnessed its

performance, but from what its noble constructor has himself informed me

of its effects on one particular nebula, with whose appearance in powerful

telescopes I am familiar, I am prepared for any statement which may be made
of its optical capacity. What may be the efl'ect of so enormous a power in
adding to our knowledge of our own immediate neighbours in the universe,
it is of course impossible to conjecture ; but for my own part I cannot help

 contemplating, as one of the grand fields open for discovery with such an
 instrument, those marvellous and mysterious bodies or systems of bodies, the

 Nebulae. By far the major part, probably at least nine-tenths of the nebu-

 lous contents of the heavens, consist of nebulae of spherical or elliptical forms

presenting every variety of elongation and central condensation. Of these

 a great number have been resolved into distinct stars, and a vast multitude
                                 ADDRESS.                                      XXXVll

more have been found to present that mottled appearance which renders it

almost a matter of certainty that an increase of optical power would show

Athem to be similarly composed.  not unnatural or unfair induction would

therefore seem to be, that those which resist such resolution do so only in

consequence of the smallness and closeness of the stars of which they con-

sist ; that, in short, they are only optically and not physically nebulous.

There is, however, one circumstance which deserves especial remark, and

which, now that my own observation has extended to the nebulas of both he-

mispheres, I feel able to announce with confidence as a general law, viz. that

the character of easy resolvability into separate and distinct stars is almost

entirely  confined  to  nebulae  deviating  but  little  from  the  spherical  form
                                                                                                 ;

while, on the other hand, very elliptic nebulae, even large and bright ones,

offer much greater difficulty in this respect. The cause of this difference

must, of course, be conjectural, but, I believe, it is not possible for any one

to review seriatim the nebulous contents of the heavens without being satisfied

of its reality as a physical character. Possibly the limits of the conditions

of dynamical stability in a spherical cluster may be compatible with less

numerous and comparatively larger individual constituents than in an elliptic

one. Be that as it may, though there is no doubt a great number of elliptic

nebulae in which stars have not yet been noticed, yet there are so many in

which they have, and the gradation is so insensible from the most perfectly

spherical to the most elongated elliptic form, that the force of the general

induction is hardly weakened by this peculiarity ; and for my own part I

should have little hesitation in admitting all nebulae of this class to be, in fact,

congeries of stars. And this seems to have been my Father's opinion of their

constitution, with the exception of certain very peculiar-looking objects, re-

specting whose nature all opinion must for the present be suspended. Now,

among all the wonders which the heavens present to our contemplation, there

is none more astonishing than such close compacted families or communities

of stars, forming systems either insulated from all others, or in binary con-

nexion, as double clusters whose confines intermix, and consisting of indivi-

dual stars nearly equal in apparent magnitude, and crowded together in such

multitudes as to defy all attempts to count or even to estimate their numbers.

What are these mysterious families ? Under what dynamical conditions do

they subsist? Is it conceivable that they can exist at all, and endure under

the Newtonian law of gravitation without perpetual collisions ? And, if so,

what a problem of unimaginable complexity is presented by such a system if
we should attempt to dive into its perturbations and its conditions of stability
by the feeble aid of our analysis ! The existence of a luminous matter, not

congregated into massive bodies in the nature of stars, but disseminated

through vast regions of space in a vaporous or cloud-like state, undergoing,

or awaiting the slow process of aggregation into masses by the power of gra-

vitation, was originally suggested to the late Sir W. Herschel in his reviews

of the nebulae, by those extraordinary objects which his researches disclosed,

which exhibit no regularity of outline, no systematic gradation of brightness,

but of which the wisps and curls of a cirrhus cloud afford a not inapt descrip-
tion. The wildest imagination can conceive nothing more capricious than

--their forms, which in many instances seem totally devoid of plan as much so
--as real clouds, in others offer traces of a regularity hardly less uncouth and

characteristic, and which in some cases seems to indicate a cellular, in others

a sheeted structure, complicated in folds as if agitated by internal winds.

Should the powers of an instrument such as Lord Rosse's succeed in resol-

ving these also into stars, and, moreover, in demonstrating the starry nature

of the regular elliptic nebulae, which have hitherto resisted such decomposi-

tion, the idea of a nebulous matter, in the nature of a shining fluid, or conden-

sible gas, must, of course, cease to rest on any support derived from actual
observation in the sidereal heavens, whatever countenance it may still receive
in the minds of cosmogonists from the tails and atmospheres of comets, and
the zodiacal light in our own system. But though all idea of its being ever
given to mortal eye, to view aught that can be regarded as an outstanding
portion of primaeval chaos, be dissipated, it will by no means have been even
then demonstrated that among those stars so confusedly scattered, no aggre-
gating powers are in action, tending to draw them into groups and insulate

them from neighbouring groups ; and, speaking from my own impressions,

I should say that, in the structure of the Magellanic Clouds, it is really difficult

not to believe we see distinct evidences of the exercise of such a power.

This part of my Father's general views of the construction of the heavens,

therefore, being entirely distinct from what has of late been called " the

--nebulous hypothesis," will still subsist as a matter of rational and philoso-

phical speculation, and perhaps all the better for being separated from the

other.

   Much has been said of late of the Nebulous Hypothesis, as a mode of re-
presenting the origin of our own planetary system. An idea of Laplace, of

which it is impossible to deny the ingenuity, of the successive abandonment
of planetary rings, collecting themselves into planets by a revolving mass
gradually shrinking in dimension by the loss of heat, and finally concentrating
itself into a sun, has been insisted on with some pertinacity, and supposed to
receive almost demonstrative support from considerations to which I shall

presently refer. I am by no means disposed to quarrel with the nebulous

hypothesis even in this form, as a matter of pure speculation,, and without
any reference to final causes ; but if it is to be regarded as a demonstrated
truth, or as receiving the smallest support from any observed numerical rela-
tions which actually hold good among the elements of the planetary orbits, I
beg leave to demur. Assuredly it receives no support from observation of
the effects of sidereal aggregation, as exemplified in the formation of globu-
lar and elliptic clusters, supposing them to have resulted from such aggrega-
tion. For we see this cause, working itself out in thousands of instances, to
 have resulted, not in the formation of a single large central body, surrounded

--by a few much smaller attendants, disposed in one plane around it, but in

systems of infinitely greater complexity, consisting of multitudes of nearly
 equal luminaries, grouped together in a solid elliptic or globular form. So
 far, then, as any conclusion from our observations of nebulae can go, the re-
 sult of agglomerative tendencies may, indeed, be the formation of families of

 stars of a general and very striking character; but we see nothing to lead us
 to presume its further result to be the surrounding of those stars with plane-
 tary attendants. If, therefore, we go on to push its application to that extent,

 we clearly theorize in advance of all inductive observation.
    But if we go still farther, as has been done in a philosophical work of

 much mathematical pretension, which has lately come into a good deal of no-

 tice in this country*, and attempt "to give a mathematical consistency" to
 such a cosmogony by the " indispensable criterion " of " a numerical verifica-

--tion," and so exhibit, as " necessary consequences of such a mode of for-

 mation," a series of numbers which observation has established independent

 of this idea, we find the author first computing the time of rotation the sun
 must have had about its axis so that a planet situate on its surface and form-
 ing a part of it should not press on that surface, and should therefore be in

 such a calculation correctly ; and avowedly, as a short-cut to a result, using
 as the basis of his calculation " the elementary Huyghenian theorems for the

    a combination which, I need not explain to those who have read the first

--book of Newton, leads direct to Kepler's law ; and if we find him then

 gravely turning round upon us, and adducing the coincidence of the result-

 ing periods compared with the distances of the planets with this law of Kepler,

--as being the numerical verification in question, M'here, I would ask, is there

 a student to be found who has graduated as a Senior Optime in this Uni-
 versity, who will not at once lay his finger on the fallacy of such an argu-
 ment*, and declare it a vicious circle ? I really should consider some apo-
logy needed for even mentioning an argument of the kind to such a meeting,
 were it not that this very reasoning, so ostentatiously put forward and so
utterly baseless, has been eagerly received among usf as the revelation of a
profound analysis. When such is the case, it is surely time to throw in a
word of M'arning, and to reiterate our recommendation of an early initiation

into mathematics, and the cherishing a mathematical habit of thought, as the
safeguard of all philosophy.

   A very great obstacle to the improvement of telescopes in this country has

been happily removed within the past year by the repeal of the duty on glass.
Hitherto, owing to the enormous expense of experiments to private indivi-

duals not manufacturers, and to the heavy excise duties imposed on the
manufacture, which has operated to repress all attempts on the part of prac-
tical men to produce glass adapted to the construction of large achromatics,
our opticians have been compelled to resort abroad for their materials
purchasing them at enormous prices, and never being able to procure the
largest sizes. The skill, enterprise and capital of the British manufacturer
have now free scope, and it is our own fault if we do not speedily rival, and
perhaps outdo the far-famed works of Munich and Paris. Indeed, it is hardly

   * M. Comte (Philosophic Positive, ii. 376, &c.), the author of the reasoning alluded to,
assures us that his calculations lead to results agreeing only approximately with the exact
periods, a difference to the amount of one-forty-fifth part more or less existing in all.

--As he gives neither the steps nor the data of his calculations, it is impossible to trace the

origin of this difference, which, however, must arise from error somewhere, if his funda-

mental princ le be really what he states. For the Huyghenian measure of centrifugal force

--^^( F OC-5 ) " combined " with " the law of gravitation " { f (X      V), replacing by its

p

equivalent, -5- can result in no other relation between P and Rthan what is expressed in the

Keplerian law, and is incompatible with the smallest deviation from it.
   Whether the sun threw off the planets or not, Kepler's law must be obeyed by them when

once fairly detached, and the sun concentrated into a spherical nucleus, such as we now

find it.
    In the above reasoning, the consideration of the sun's varying oblateness has been omitted

as complicating the argument. It is easily taken account of, hut with no benefit to the
theory contended against. It should moreover be noticed that the actual time of rotation

of the sun on its axis stands in utter contradiction with that theory.

   How, then, can their actual observance of this law be adduced in proof of their origin, one

way or the other ? How is it proved that the sun must have thrown off planets at those

--distances and at no others, where we find them, no matter in what times revolving ?

That, indeed, would be a powerful presumptive argument ; but what geometer will venture
on such a tour d' analyse ? And, lastly, how can it be adduced as a numerical coincidence
of an hypothesis with observed fact to say that, at an unknown epoch, the sun's rotation
(not observed) must have been so and so, if the hypothesis were a true one ?

possible to over-estimate the effect of this fiscal change on a variety of other
sciences to which the costliness of glass apparatus has been hitherto an ex-
ceeding drawback, not only fronr) the actual expense of apparatus already in

common use, but as repressing the invention and construction of new appli-

cations of this useful material.

   A great deal of attention has been lately, and I think very wisely, drawn

to the philosophy of science and to the principles of logic, as founded, not on
arbitrary and pedantic forms, but on a careful inductive inquiry into the

grounds of human belief, and the nature and extent of man's intellectual
faculties. If we are ever to hope that science will extend its range into the
 domain of social conduct, and model the course of human actions on that
 thoughtful and effective adaptation of means to their end, which is its funda-
 mental principle in all its applications (the means being here the total devo-

--tion of our moral and intellectual powers the end, our own happiness and
--that of all around us) if such be the far hopes and long-protracted aspira-

 tions of science, its philosophy and its logic assume a paramount importance,
 in proportion to the practical danger of erroneous conceptions in the one, and

 fallacious tests of the validity of reasoning in the other.

    On both these subjects works of first-rate importance have of late illustrated
the scientific literature of this country. On the philosophy of science, we
 have witnessed the production, by the pen of a most distinguished member

 of this Universitj', of a work so comprehensive in its views, so vivid in its
 illustrations, and so right-minded in its leading directions, that it seems to

 me impossible for any man of science, be his particular department of inquiry

 what it may, to rise from its perusal without feeling himself strengthened and
 invigorated for his own especial pursuit, and placed in a more favourable
 position for discovery in it than before, as well as more competent to estimate
 the true philosophical value and import of any new views which may opeo
 to him in its prosecution. From the peculiar and a priori point of view in
 which the distinguished author of the work in question has thought proper to
 place himself before his subject, many may dissent; and I own myself to be

--of the number ; but from this point of view it is perfectly possible to depart

 without losing sight of the massive reality of that subject itself: on the con-
 trary, that reality will be all the better seen and understood, and its magni-
 tude felt when viewed from opposite sides, and under the influence of every

 accident of light and shadow which peculiar habits of thought may throw

  over it.

     Accordingly, in the other work to which I have made allusion, and which,
 under the title of a 'System of Logic,' has for its object to give "a con-
 nected view of the principles of evidence and the methods of scientific investi-
 gation," its acute, and in many respects profound author, taking up an
  almost diametrically opposite station, and looking to experience as the ulti-

 --mate foundation of all knowledge at least, of all scientific knowledge, in
 --its simplest axioms as well as in its most remote results has presented us

  with a view of the inductive philosophy, very different indeed in its general

 aspect, but in which, when carefully examined, most essential features may
  be recognised as identical, while some are brought out with a salience and

  effect which could not be attained from the contrary point of sight. It cannot
  be expected that I should enter into any analysis or comparison of these re-

 markable works ; but it seemed to me impossible to avoid pointedly mention-

  ing them on this occasion, because they certainly, taken together, leave
  the philosophy of science, and indeed the principles of all general reasoning,
  in a very different state from that in which they found them. Their influence
  indeed, and that of some other works of prior date, in which the same gene-
  ral subjects have been more lightly touched upon, has already begun to be fe

and responded to from a quarter where, perhaps, any sympathy in this respect
might hardly have been looked for. The philosophical mind of Germany has

begun, at length, effectually to awaken from the dreamy trance in which it

had been held for the last half-century, and in which the jargon of the Abso-

Anlutists and Ontologists had been received as oracular.  " anti-speculative
--philosophy " has arisen and found supporters rejected, indeed, by the Onto-

logists, but yearly gaining ground in the general mind. It is something so

new for an English and a German philosopher to agree in their estimate
either of the proper objects of speculation or of the proper mode of pursuing

them, that we greet, not without some degree of astonishment, the appearance

of works like the Logic and the New Psychology of Beneke, in which this

false and delusive philosophy is entirely thrown aside, and appeal at once

made to the nature of things as we find them, and to the laws of our in-
tellectual and moral nature, as our own consciousness and the history of

mankind reveal them to us*.

Meanwhile, the fact is every year becoming more broadly manifest, by the

successful application of scientific principles to subjects which had hitherto

been only empirically treated (of which agriculture may be taken as perhaps

the most conspicuous instance), that the great work of Bacon was not the

completion, but, as he himself foresaw and foretold, only the commencement

of his own philosophy ; and that we are even yet only at the threshold of that

palace of Truth which succeeding generations will range over as their own

--a world of scientific inquiry, in which not matter only and its properties,

but the far more rich and complex relations of life and thought, of passion

and motive, interest and actions, will come to be regarded as its legitimate

objects. Nor let us fear that in so regarding them we run the smallest danger

of collision with any of those great principles which we regard, and rightly

Aregard, as sacred from question.  faithful and undoubting spirit carried

into the inquiry will secure us from such dangers, and guide us, like an in-

stinct, in our paths through that vast and entangled region which intervenes

between those ultimate principles and their extreme practical applications.

It is only by working our way upwards towards those principles as well as

downwardsfrom them, that we can ever hope to penetrate such intricacies

--and thread their maze ; and it would be worse than folly it would be treason
--against all our highest feelings to doubt that to those who spread themselves

over these opposite lines, each moving in his own direction, a thousand points

of meeting and mutual and joyful recognition will occur.

But if Science be really destined to expand its scope, and embrace objects

beyond the range of merely material relation, it must not altogether and

obstinately refuse, even within the limits of such relations, to admit conceptions

which at first sight may seem to trench upon the immaterial, such as we have

been accustomed to regard it. The time seems to be approaching when a

--merely mechanical view of nature will become impossible when the notion

of accounting for all the phsenomena of nature, and even of mere physics,

by simple attractions and repulsions fixedly and unchangeably inherent in

material centres (granting any conceivable system of Boscovichian alterna-

tions), will be deemed untenable. Already we have introduced the idea of

heat-atmospJieres about particles to vary their repulsive forces according to

definite laws. But surely this can only be regarded as one of those provi-

sional and temporary conceptions, which, though it may be useful as helping

us to laws and as suggesting experiments, we must be prepared to resign if

ever such ideas, for instance, as radiant stimulus or conducted influence

should lose their present vagueness, and come to receive some distinct scien-
tific interpretation. It is one thing, however, to suggest that our present

--language and conceptions should be held as provisional another to recom-

mend a general unsettling of all received ideas. Whatever innovations of
this kind may arise, they can only be introduced slowly, and on a full sense

of their necessity ; for the limited faculties of our nature will bear but little
of this sort at a time without a kind of intoxication, which precludes ail rec-

--tilinear progress or, rather, all progress whatever, except in a direction

which terminates in the wildest vagaries of mysticism and clairvoyance.
    But, without going into any subtleties, I may be allowed to suggest that

it is at least high time that philosophers, both physical and others, should
come to some nearer agreement than appears to prevail as to the meaning

they intend to convey in speaking of causes and causation. On the one hand
we are told that the grand object of physical inquiry is to explain the phae-
nomena of nature by referring them to their causes ; on the other, that the

inquiry into causes is altogether vain and futile, and that Science has no

concern but with the discovery of Imvs. Which of these is the truth ? Or

are both views of the matter true on a different interpretation of the terms?

Whichever view we may take, or whichever interpretation adopt, there is one

--thing certain, the extreme inconvenience of such a state of language. This

can only be reformed by a careful analysis of this widest of all human gene-
ralizations, disentangling from one another the innumerable shades of mean-
ing which have got confounded together in its progress, and establishing
among them a rational classification and nomenclature. Until this is done
we cannot be sure, that by the relation of cause and effect one and the same
kind of relation is understood. Indeed, using the words as we do, we are

quite sure that the contrary is often the case ; and so long as uncertainty in
this respect is suffered to prevail, so long will this unseemly contradiction
subsist, and not only prejudice the cause of science in the eyes of manki id,
but create disunion of feeling, and even give rise to accusations and recri-
minations on the score of principle among its cultivators.

   The evil I complain of becomes yet more grievous when the idea of law
is brought so prominently forward as not merely to throw into the back-
ground that of cause, but almost to thrust it out of vicAV altogether ; and if
not to assume something approaching to the character of direct agency, at
least to place itself in the position of a substitute for what mankind in general
understand by explanation : as when we are told, for example, that the suc-
cessive appearance of races of organized beings on earth, and their disappear-
ance, to give place to others, which Geology teaches us, is a result of some
certain law of development, in virtue of which an unbroken chain of gra-
dually exalted organization from the crystal to the globule, and thence,
through the successive stages of the polypus, the moUusk, the insect, the fish,
the reptile, the bird, and the beast, up to the monkey and the man (nay, for
aught we know, even to the angel), has been (or remains to be) evolved.
Surely, when we hear such a theory, the natural human craving after causes,
capable in some conceivable way of giving rise to such changes and trans-
formations of organ and intellect, causes ivhy the development at different

parts of its progress should divaricate into different [\nes,-- causes, at all

--events, intermediate between the steps of the development becomes im-

portunate. And when nothing is offered to satisfy this craving, but loose

and vague reference to favourable circumstances of climate, food, and general
situation, which no experience has ever shown to convert one species into
another ; who is there who does not at once perceive that such a theory is in
no respect more explanatory, than that would be which simply asserted a
miraculous intervention at every successive step of that unknown scries of

events by which the earth has been alternately peopled and dispeopled of its

denizens?

  A law may be a rule of action, but it is not action. The Great First

Agent may lay down a rule of action for himself, and that rule may become

known to man by observation of its uniformity : but constituted as our minds

are, and having that conscious knowledge of causation which is forced upon

us by the reality of the distinction between intending a thing and doing it,

we can never substitute the Rule for the Act. Either directly or through

delegated agency, whatever takes place is not merely willed, but done, and

what is done we then only declare to be explained, when we can trace a

process, and show that it consists of steps analogous to those we observe in

occurrences which have passed often enough before our own eyes to have

become familiar, and to be termed natural. So long as no such process

can be traced and analysed out in this manner, so long the phaenomenon

is unexplained, and remains equally so whatever be the number of unex-

plained steps inserted between its beginning and its end. The transition

from an inanimate crystal to a globule capable of such endless organic and

intellectual development, is as great a step as unexplained a one as un-

--intelligible to us and in any human sense of the word, as miraculous as the

immediate creation and introduction upon earth of every species and every

individual would be. Take these amazing facts of geology which way we

will, we must resort elsewhere than to a mere speculative law of develop-

ment for their explanation.

   Visiting as we do once more this scene of one of our earliest and most

--agreeable receptions as travellers on the journey of life brought back by

the course of events to scenes associated with exciting recollections and the

--memory of past kindness we naturally pause and look back on the interval

Howwith that interest which always arises on such occasions : "  has it fared

with you meanwhile ? " we fancy ourselves asked. " How have you prosper-

Howed ? " " Has this long interval been well or ill spent ? " "  is it with the

cause in which you have embarked ? " " Has it flourished or receded, and ta

what extent have you been able to advance it ? " To all these questions we

may, I believe, conscientiously, and with some self-gratulation, answer

Well ! The young and then but partially fledged institution has become

established and matured. Its principles have been brought to the test of a

long and various experience, and been found to work according to the ex-

pectations of its founders. Its practice has been brought to uniformity and

consistency, on rules which, on the whole, have been found productive of no

inconvenience to any of the parties concerned. Our calls for reports on the

actual state and deficiencies of important branches of science, and on the

most promising lines of research in them, have been answered by most valu-
able and important essays from men of the first eminence in their respective

departments, not only condensing what is known, but adding largely to it,
and in a multitude of cases entering very extensively indeed into original in-

quiries and investigations ; of which Mr. Scott Russell's Report on Waves,

and Dr. Carpenter's on the Structure of Shells, and several others in the

most recently published volume of our Reports, that for the York meeting
last summer, may be specified as conspicuous instances.

Independent of these reports, the original communications read or ver-

bally made to our several Sections have been in the highest degree interest-

ing and copious ; not only as illustrating and .extending almost every branch

of science, but as having given rise to dil&iifsions and interchanges of idea
and information between the members present, of which it is perfectly im-

possible to appreciate sufficiently the influence and value. Ideas thus com-

municated fructify in a wonderful manner on subsequent reflection, and be-f

come, 1 am persuaded, in innumerable cases, the germs of theories, and the

connecting links between distant regions of thought, which might have other-

wise continued indefinitely dissociated.

  How far this Association has hitherto been instrumental in fulfilling the

ends for which it was called into existence, can, however, be only imperfectly

estimated from these considerations. Science, as it stands at present, is
not merely advanced by speculation and thought ; it stands in need of ma-

terial appliances and means ; its pursuit is costly, and to those who pursue
it for its own sake, utterly unremunerative, however largely the community
may benefit by its applications, and however successfully practical men may
turn their own or others' discoveries to account. Hence arises a wide field

for scientific utility in the application of pecuniary resources in aid of private
research, and one in which assuredly this Association has not held back its
hand. I have had the curiosity to cast up the sums which have been ac-

tually paid, or are now in immediate course of payment, on account of grants

for scientific purposes by this Association since its last meeting at this place,

and I find them to amount to not less than 11,167/. And when it is re-

collected that in no case is any portion of these grants applied to cover any
personal expense, it will easily be seen how very large an amount of scien-

tific activity has been brought into play by its exertions in this respect, to
say nothing of the now very numerous occasions in which the attention and
aid of Government have been effectually drawn to specific objects at our

instance.

As regards the general progress of Science within the interval I have

alluded to, it is far too wide a field for me now to enter upon, and it would

be needless to do so in this assembly, scarcely a man of which has not been

actively employed in urging on the triumphant march of its chariot-wheels,

and felt in his own person the high excitement of success joined with that

noble glow which is the result of companionship in honourable effort. May

such ever be the prevalent feeling among us I True Science, like true Reli-

gion, is wide-embracing in its extent and aim. Let interests divide the

Weworldly and jealousies torment the envious I  breathe, or long to breathe,

a purer empyrean. The common pursuit of Truth is of itself a brotherhood.

--In these our annual meetings, to which every corner of Britain almost every

nation in Europe sends forth as its representative some distinguished culti-

vator of some separate branch of knowledge ; where, I would ask, in so vast

a variety of pursuits which seem to have hardly anything in common, are we

to look for that acknowledged source of delight which draws us together and

inspires us with a sense of unity ? That astronomers should congregate to

-- -- --talk of stars and planets chemists of atoms geologists of strata is natural

enough ; but what is there of equal mutual interest, equally connected with

and equally pervading all they are engaged upon, which causes their hearts

to burn within them for mutual communication and unbosoming? Surely,

were each of us to give utterance to all he feels, we should hear the chemist,

the astronomer, the physiologist, the electrician, the botanist, the geologist,

all with one accord, and each in the language of his own science, declaring
not only the wonderful works of God disclosed by it, but the delight which

their disclosure affords him, and the privilege he feels it to be to have aided

--in it. This is indeed a magnificent induction a consilience there is no re-

fusing. It leads us to look onward, through the long vista of time, with
chastened but confident assurance that Science has still other and nobler
work to do than any she has yet attempted ; work, which before she is pre-

pared to attempt, the minds of men must be prepared to receive the attempt,

--prepared, I mean, by an entire conviction of the wisdom of her views, the

purity of her objects and the faithfulness of her disciples.

   Sabine, appointed to conduct the cooperation of the British Associ-

                 Arctic Expedition.

It having been resolved upon by government to equip a new Arctic Expe-

dition, under the command of Sir John Franklin, with a view to the comple-

tion of the discovery of a north-west passage, two ships, the Erebus and Terror,

the former commanded by Sir J. Franiilin, the latter by Captain Crozier, have

been commissioned for the purpose, and provided not only with every former

means of security and comfort, but with a means of applying the power of steam

for availing themselves of occasional favourable opportunities for its application.

So far as relates to the prosecution of magnetic and meteorological observa-

tion, they go provided with all the necessary instruments and instructions.

The officers, five in number, who will be charged with their use, have availed
themselves with all diligence and assiduity of the instructions afforded them

by Colonel Sabine, and should the Expedition pass the winter in the Arctic
Sea, to the north of America, the opportunities afforded of observing mag-

netic disturbances, in near proximity to the Magnetic Pole and in the region

of the Aurora, will be in the highest degree interesting, and will call for every

practicable exertion in watching for and observing simultaneous disturbances

in Europe and America, wherever magnetic observation is at the time in

progress. Among the instruments with which this Expedition is provided,

is one of a novel description, contrived by Professor Lloyd, for determining
the absolute total force by direct observation in dips from 80° to 90°. The
interesting discovery of Sir James Ross, of a barometric pressure in the
Antarctic Seas lower by more than an inch than at the equator, will render
the barometric observations of this Expedition especially important, in con-
sequence of attention being drawn to circumstances in the usual mode of
executing barometric observations in severe colds, which have been supposed
capable of partially maslcing this peculiarity, and upon which we shall now be
enabled to pronounce definitively.

    As the Magnetic Pole will be again probably approached in this Expedition,
an opportunity will be afforded of ascertaining (at least by subsequent calcu-
lation) whether any and what change has taken place in the situation of that
important point since the date of Sir .Tames Ross's observations, and should
the Expedition be successful in making their passage home by Behring's
Straits, an invaluable series of data along the northern coast of America to

the Straits in question will be secured.

           Neiv Stations for Meteorological and Magnetic Observations.

   The Astronomical and Meteorological Society of British Guiana have re-
cently established an observatory in that colony for the purpose of making
astronomical, meteorological and magnetic observations, and have (partly by
the grant of magnetic and other instruments used by Sir R. Schomburgk in
his survey of the colony, partly at their own cost) furnished it with in-
struments. Not content with this, however, they have engaged a competent
and well-recommended observer, at a liberal salary, so that we have here an
example which it may be hoped our other colonies will eagerly imitate, of

scientific cooperation, voluntarily undertaken, in a highly interesting region,

from which the best results may be hoped.
    The prospect of a colonial observatory at Colombo in Ceylon, though not

yet realized, appears by a letter received by Colonel Sabine from Capt. Pick-
ering, dated January 18, 184-5, to be still entertained, since that gentleman
has received the Governor's directions to prepare estimates for tlie building
and establishment.

   It is assuredly much to be desired that such of our colonies as are capable

of bearing the expense of such institutions, should be encouraged by such
examples to take part in the great and important work which remains to be
done, in order to place terrestrial magnetism and meteorology in the rank of
permanently progressive sciences. The government observatories, by im-
proving the instruments and methods of observation and chalking out the
course of observation most desirable to be pursued, have laid the foundations
of a system which must, sooner or later, be carried out in all climates and in
every part of the globe. But the system is yet susceptible of further perfec-
tion, which it has been and is receiving. Several important defects have
been remedied, and as far as the magnetic observations go, a definite and
well-directed course is taken. The meteorological system is also beginning to
assume a more distinct and regularly improving form ; distinct notions of im-
portant objects to be attained, and improvements introduced into the instru-
mental departments, which by degrees will fit them for objects they are not
yet competent to. Should the government observatories at Toronto and Van
Diemen's Land ultimately come to be handed over to their respective colonies
as part of tiieir domestic institutions, not only would a permanent contribution
 of data be secured to science, but incalculable benefit would arise to the
 colonies themselves, in the possession of establishments in which the art of
 observing has been wrought up to elaborate perfection, and in which practice

going Land in hand with theory, would act as a powerful engine of public

instruction.

              Magnetic Surveys.

   The completion of Lieut. Lefroy's North American Survey has furnished
data in the highest degree satisfactory. Above 100 stations have been ob-
served by him, at which the three elements have been determined within the
isodynamic oval of 1'7 in North America. The examination which has been
instituted of these shows the observations to be satisfactory. His magnetorae-
tric observations, made hourly during the winter, show some extraordinary

disturbances; one on the 17th April 1844, gave changes of 8° 10' in declina-

tion and 0"16 of horizontal force.

   Lieuts. Moor and Clerk sailed on the 9th of January from the Cape, on
the magnetic survey of that portion of the Antarctic Ocean left unexplored
by Sir James Ross, to which allusion was made as contemplated in our last

report. This survey will complete our knowledge of iso-magnetic lines in the

South Seas.
   In the United States Prof. Renwick has occupied himself with the obser-

vation of the three magnetic elements at the stations of the Trigonometrical
Survey from Rhode Island southward to Annapolis in Maryland, while Prof.
Bache carries on the same process from Annapolis southward, and in the
course of the current year will probably have extended his operations to the
Gulf of Mexico. The former of these zealous cooperators in our cause has
proposed to establish, at Columbia College, a barometrical record simultaneous
with that at Toronto, in which instruments carefully compared with our
standards, by means of a portable barometer making the circuit of London,

New York, Toronto, New York, and London, will be employed.

             Publication of Magnetic and Meteorological Observations.

   The Toronto observations of 1840, 1841 and 1842, are printed, and in the
hands of most of our correspondents. So are also the first volume of ' Extra-
ordinary Magnetic Disturbances at the Government. Stations,' and two vo-
lumes of the ' Greenwich Observations,' containing those of 1840, 1841 and

1842. An immense arrear remains, and must remain, in spite of every exer-

tion, unless an increase in the superintendent's establishment afford the means
of greatei;" despatch. Representations have been made with the view of pro-
curing such increase, the result of which is not yet known. Should it prove,
as it is hoped, successful, the work of reduction and publication will proceed
with all desirable alacrity, and the world be speedily put in possession of the
whole results.

   The Honourable the Court of Directors of the East India Company has

been applied to on the part of the Royal Society, to authorize the printing of
the observations communicated from the four Indian establishments. The pro-

position has been entertained, and estimates are in course of preparation. No

final decision has been yet however come to, though there seems no reason to
fear that it will be unfavourable. The observations which have been received
from these observatories have been partially examined by Dr. Lloyd, and
awaiting the appearance of the observations themselves in a public form,
the following remarks on them, so far as that examination has gone, will pro-
bably be considered interesting to the Association :

their examination has, I hope, enabled me to be of some use to the observers,
in the correction and improvement of tlieir methods of observing. Much
valuable time however was lost at the commencement, owing to some diffi-

culty respecting the transmission of the observations, of the nature of which

I am not aware ; and, as the last of the records sent were those of June op
July ISiS, I am unable to say how far the instructions suggested by the
perusal of the earlier observations may have turned to account. These cir-
cumstances, over which I had no control, prevented me from sending (as I

otherwise should) any report on these observations to the Royal Society, as I
felt that any report, founded upon the data which had come before me, would
necessarily be unsatisfactory, and in some degree unjust, to the very zealous
directors of the observatories.

    " I shall best perhaps fulfil the wish expressed in your letter, by sending a
few notes extracted from the memoranda which I made at the time of the
perusal of the observations, which you can use as you think fit.

   " The observatory at Simla, under the direction of Major Boileau, is in all
respects admirably organized, and has furnished a larger amount of work than
perhaps any of the whole cooperation.

   " In order to save time, Major Boileau erected a temporary wooden build-
ing at Simla on his arrival, and commenced his series of observations there the
1st of January 1841. Meanwhile, the site of the permanent observatory was
selected, the stone available for the building carefully examined for mag-
netism, &c. ; the building erected on a judicious plan, and the observations
begun there the 1st of July 1841.

   " At this station the mean height of the barometer is only 23"2 inches ; I
need not observe upon the value of an extended and complete series of mete-
orological observations made at this altitude (8000 feet about). The many
questions, the solution of which has been but partly obtained by the observa-
tions of meteorologists upon the Faulhorn and the St. Bernard, may be ex-
pected to receive a complete answer in the Simla observations.

   " Major Boileau has added much to the usual routine of observatory work.
In September 1841, he commenced observing every fifteen minutes ! and has,
I believe, continued that immense labour to the present time. He also made,
daily, two series of corresponding observations taken every five minutes, and
each lasting one hour. One of these was made in correspondence with the
Van Diemen's Land Observatory, and the other with Singapore and Trevan-
drum. He has made a very complete comparison of the wet-bulb and of

Daniell's hygrometer, and has constructed an elaborate table for reducing the
results obtained with the former instrument.

   " Among the remarkable results which appear on the face of the observa-
tions, I may mention that, generally, during magnetic storms, the changes of

intensity preponderate over those of direction in the results ; while it seems
to be otherwise in the regular hourly variations.

    " Smart shocks of earthquake were felt at Simla on the 19th of February
and 5th of March 1842, which disturbed all the magnets violently. Their
mean positions were however unaltered, so that the effect was merely me-

chanical.

    " Of the true magnetic disturbances. Major Boileau says, that that of the
2nd and 4th of July 1842, was ' the greatest which occurred since the esta-
blishment of the observatory.' It was also the greatest observed in Dublin

considerably greater than that of September 1841.
    " The absolute observations of declination and inclination at Simla are ex-

cellent. Those of intensity are less so, owing to defects in the method of ob-
servation, which have been since remedied.

                                                    " Madras.

   " Lieut. Ludlow waited for the completion of the building of his observa-
tory, and accordingly his regular series of observations commenced only in

March 1841. He took the precaution of observing the time of vibration of

all his magnets in Dublin before starting, and on his arrival at Madras, and
was thus enabled to select for use those whose magnetism was most steady.

   " You are aware that a perfect determination of the changes of the third

element has been a serious desideratum in most of the observatories, the in-

strument devised by me for the determination of the variations of the vertical
component of the force having in most cases failed. The value of the results
in this case depends entirely on the individual instrument, and I do not know

any that have given good results, with the exception of those belonging to the
observatories of Toronto, Madras and Singapore. This circumstance adds
much value to the results of these observatories, inasmuch as the observations
made with this apparatus cover a space of nearly three years, and of course it
furnishes an argument for the publication of the Madras and Singapore ob-

servations.

   " Lieut. Ludlow cautiously avoided all the difficult work of absolute deter-
minations, until he found himself master of the methods ; and accordingly his
results of this kind are free from the errors which are to be found in the earlier
observations made elsewhere. The absolute determinations commenced at
Madras with the year 1842.

                                                       " Singapore.

   " The observations made at Singapore, under the direction of Lieut.
Elliott, commenced earlier than either of the other Indian stations, namely, in
December 1840, and (as regards term observations) in the month preceding.

   " The vertical force instrument has worked at this station perhaps better
than at any other, and accordingly the results have a peculiar value.

   " The diurnal changes at Singapore are remarkable for their regularity, so
much so, that the diurnal curve may be obtained satisfactorily from a very
limited number of observations.

    " After the example of Major Boileau, Lieut. Elliott has had observations

taken every fifteen minutes, commencing in April 1842. I am not aware

whether he still continues this labour.
    " Lieut. Elliott has made, from time to time, a considerable series of obser-

vations (simultaneous with those of the observatory) at Java, Borneo, and

other places.

   " The atmosphere at Singapore is loaded with moisture. Lieut. Elliott has
taken numerous observations of the actinometer ; but the place is unfavoura-
ble and the observations unsatisfactory.

  A letter from Professor Bache to Colonel Sabine announces the gratifying

fact, that the Senate of the United States has ordered the publication, in
full, at the expense of that government, of the magnetic and meteorological
observations at Girard College, Philadelphia, and at Washington ; both which

publications are now proceeding.
   M. Plantamour has commenced the publication of the observations at Ge-

neva. M. Kreil has published the fifth volume of the Prague observations.
As regards the circulation of the printed observations, arrangements have
been made by the Royal Society for the regular communication of the Green-

ON MAGNETICAL. AND METEOROLOGICAL. OBSERVATIONS. 9

   The Board of Ordnance has given orders that copies of all the observations
at the Ordnance observatories shall henceforward be sent to the governors of
all our colonies, to be by them deposited in the most accessible public li-
braries for colonial reference. They have been hitherto, and will in future
continue to be presented to the directors of all foreign magnetic and meteoro-
logical observatories officially instituted, and to eminent persons in those

sciences.

Approaching conclusion of the present system of magnetic and meteorological
            establishments, and considerations thereby rendered necessary.

   The second term of three years for which the British Government and the
East India Company have granted the existing establishments will conclude
with the expiration of the current year ; and as the termination of the British

system of observation will in all probability carry along with it the cessation of

many or most of the other European series of observations, it has been an

anxious subject of deliberation with your Committee what course to recom-

mend to the Association under such circumstances. On the one hand there

is the serious responsibility of advising the continuance of very heavy expense,
both to the Government and the East India Company, and of a vast devotion

of time and labour of eminent individuals in science, and of energetic and

devoted observers. On the other, the high importance of the objects in view,

the interest which they yearly continue to excite more and more in the pub-

lic mind, and the perception that the great problems they propose to resolve
are of a nature to yield only to continued and persevering inquiry. Under

these considerations it was resolved at the last meeting of the Association to

request a conference of the most eminent foreign magnetists and meteorolo-

gists on the subject, viz. Messrs. Gauss, Weber, Humboldt, Dove, Erman,
Hansteen, Plana, Plantamour, Kamtz, Gillis, Bache, Loomis, Kupffer, Arago,

Quetelet, Kreil, Laniont, Boguslawski and Baron Senftenberg, to be held at

this meeting, and invitations were issued accordingly, the gratifying effect

of which has been to procure a prospect of the personal attendance at their
deliberations, of Messrs. Kupffer, Kreil, Dove, Erman, and Baron Senften-

berg.

In addition to this, an extensive correspondence has been entered into on

the part of your Committee for the purpose of learning the sentiments both of

them, and of such other high authorities in the practical and theoretical de-

partments of these subjects, on the important matter under deliberation.

This correspondence will be found attached as an appendix to the present

report, and it has afforded your Committee the means of presenting to the

conference for discussion the principal features of the subjec|; in a more

methodical order than would probably have been the case without some pre-

Aliminary communication of the kind.  careful and minute analysis of the

several letters received has enabled them to classify the various and valuable

suggestions contained in them, and to arrange under distinct heads the ques-

tions which will have to be decided on in case the general opinion should

prove favourable to the longer continuance of the system.

It has therefore appeared to your Committee advisable to propose for con-

sideration at the approaching conference, the following heads of inquiry,

without prejudice to such other points relative to the general question as the

experience and judgement of any of their distinguished coadjutors may suggest

for discussion.

I. Under all the circumstances, is it the opinion of the conference that the

combined system of magnetic and meteorological observation ought to be

continued longer ?
           ----

--10 REPORT 1845.

    Should their opinion be in the negative, there is of course no room for
further deliberation, except in so far as may relate to any changes of appa-
ratus, methods, &c. which it may be wortli while to make, or any experiments
to perform in the short interval to the end of the year. In order therefore to
give room for any further inquiry, it is necessary to suppose, at least provi-
sionally, that some considerable amount of opinion in favour of continuance
is manifested, which, should it prove to be the case (as the general tenor of
the correspondence would appear to indicate), it may perhaps be advisable
still to wave coming to any Jinal conclusion on this principal head, until the
subordinate subjects shall have undergone discussion ; and this, if for no other
reason, because, agreeing in the general principle, it may be found impossible
to reconcile all opinion respecting the details. Assuming then provisionally
an affirmative opinion on the general principle, the following are the general
heads under which it would appear most convenient to arrange the subjects of

consideration :

   A. The general si/stem of magnetic observation atfixed stations.
          a. The daily observations.
          b. The absolute determinations.
         c. Term observations.

            d. Disturbances.

             e. Instruments.

           f. Additional observations.
   B. The general system of meteorological observation atfixed stations.

          a. The daily observations.
          b. Term observations.

            c. Instruments.

            d. Additional observations.

   C. Stations, and duration of the system.
          a. The Ordnance stations.
          b. The Admiralty stations.
          c. The East India stations.
           d. Permanence or temporary duration of the stations.
           e. Observers and assistants.

   D. Surveys and auxiliary stations.
           a. Magnetic surveys by land and sea.

            b. Auxiliary barometric stations.

   E. Problems solved and to be solved.
    F. Particular suggestions which deserve consideration.
   Under each of these general heads and their subdivisions, particular sug-
gestions have been made and alterations proposed or objected to, giving rise
to questions a great deal too numerous and extensive to admit of their being
each discussed in full detail at a conference so limited in time as this must be.
Nevertheless it will be proper to specify under each, in the manner of a re-
sume, what are the particular questions which have arisen in the minds of our
correspondents or have been subsequently suggested, with a view to selecting
those of most importance ; and these are as Ibllows :

 A --a. Daily observations. Should they be made hourly, two-hourly, four-,

              six- or eight-hourly ? by night as well as by day ? at Gottingen time
                or that of the place ? at constant or variable hours with the season
              of the year? Should they be made two-hourly for a certain time
               and subsequently changed to four- or six-hourly?

  A --b. Absolute determinations. Should they be made monthly, or how often?

            For what elements ? What methods should be pursued in their de-

                 termination ?
    ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 11

A --c. Term observations. Should they be discarded (as seems the general

           impression) or increased in number and made weekly, as Dr. Lloyd
           recommends ? Should Gottingen time be used in them ? Should a
            term be broken off if no disturbance be apparent at the usual time

             of greatest disturbance ?

A --d. Disturbances. Should the inquiry into disturbances rely on term-

           observations only, or should extra observations be made whenever
            they are supposed to be in progress ? Should a few continuous ob-
          servations be made at the usual hours of maximum disturbance, to
           detect them ? Ought the readings of the instruments during them
          to be registered at definite instants of Gottingen mean time, or at
           the instants of great jumps or turning points? Ought any special
          provision to be made for their observation during Sir John Frank-

A --lin's stay near the pole ?
    e. Instruments. Ought the present instruments to continue in use, or
          any, and what changed? Ought magnets to be interchanged?
            Should self-registering magnetic apparatus to register disturbances
     --attaining a certain magnitude ? New instruments induction mag-
     -- --netometer theodolite ditto M. Lamont's new inventions ?

--Ay. Additional observations. Should any, and what, be in future made ?
--B a. Daily Meteorological Observations. Should any immediate change be

          made in the hours ? in the instruments ? Should night observations

             be discontinued ?

--B b. Meteorological Terms. Should these be discontinued ? Should they
     --be modified as to the extent of the observations ?

B c. Meteorological Instruments. Should self-registering instruments be

           used ? and what ? Should encouragements be held out for their
          improval ? and of what sort? who to be the judges, and what the
          conditions of their introduction into use ? At what times and on
          what understandings are new instruments generally to be intro-

           duced ? Should a system of itinerant instruments of comparison be

     --adopted ? at what intervals ? and in what order ?

B d. Additional Observations. Of thermometers, wet and dry, at several
         elevations in the air ? Of temperatures of soil at several depths ?
          Of atmospheric electricity ? with what instrument ? Peltier's ?
          Gourjon's ? Mr. Wheatstone's new principle and apparatus ? of

           barometer continuously during storms ? Should the wind be regis-
           tered at each observation ? Should any other class of phaenomena
           be observed ?

--Ca,cb. Of the Ordnance and Admiralty Stations. Should all be con-

          tinued in activity or not, and which ? If the same number be re-
           tained, is it desirable to continue or change the stations ? Should

     --any endeavour be made to procure additional colonial stations ?

C c. The East India Observatories. Should any and which of them be
          continued ? The expense of Simla being particularly heavy, is it

          desirable to recommend its continuance ?

--C d. Permanence or Temporary continuance. For how long a period would

           it be desirable to continue each station seriatim ? Should any one

     --or more be permanent ?

C e. Observers and Assistants. Should the force of each observatory seria-

D --tim be diminished or increased ?
   a. Survey and Auxiliary Stations Should any and what local surveys
          be recommended ? Should the observatories be given up, would any
           local surveys deserve recommendation ? Should the observations
--12 REPORT 1845.

       --of travellers be encouraged, and how? by publication of their re-

              sults ? At whose expense ? Are there any extensive tracts of sea
               in which nautical surveys (Magnetic and Meteorological) would be

  D --desirable ?
      b. Auxiliary Stations. By what means can chains or triangles of stations
                of meteorological observation be best encouraged or effected ?
              Should any attempt be made to carry out such a chain of posts
               northward from Toronto ?

                           E. Problems Solved and to be Solved.

    Is it the opinion of the conference that the laiu of diurnal change of the
magnetic elements may be considered as satisfactorily ascertained for any and
what station ?

    Is the law of daily range (disturbances excepted) of the magnetic elements
or any of them made out ?

   Is the law of annual (periodical) fluctuation made out? Is its dependence

-- -- --on temperature ? on evaporation ? on precipitation ? distinctly ascer-

tained ?

   Is the direction and amount of secular change for any and what station made
out?

 --Is Toronto favourably or unfavourably situated for, 1 st, the determination

of the maximum or minimum quantity of dip, and has it been determined ?

2ndly, for the epoch of the turning point of dip, and has that been ascertained,
or in how many years could it be ascertained, or is it now possible to ascer-

tain it at all ?

   Has any correspondence in the magnitude and direction of great disturb-
ances been perceived in very distant stations?

   Are days of great disturbance general though the particular phases differ

in different localities ?

    Shall we, at the end of 1845, be in possession of data for computing the
Gaussian constants for 1842-4-3, in virtue of the totality of observations
made or to be made up to that time ?

    If not, is there a reasonable prospect that in a given time, say three or four
years more, by proceeding as at present with observatories and surveys, we
shall be so ?

   Have the disturbance observations as yet manifested any intelligible con-
nexion with aurora further than that certain auroras do and certain do not

affect the needle ?

   Have the observations hitherto made held out any appearance of connexion

--with any other cause ?
   In Meteorology. Has any striking discovery been elicited by the observa-
tions made, either at fixed stations or in the progress of the Antarctic ex-

pedition besides that of the lower barometric pressure already noticed ?

   Has M. Dove's resolution of barometric fluctuation into two elements

received any confirmation ?

                      F. Particular Suggestions deserving Consideration.

  --Is it desirable that meteorological registers made at sea in toto or re-
--duced should be published ?

   Would it be desirable if practicable to publish monthly or quarterly returns?
   Would it be advisable to procure from the Royal Society, or other quarters

where meteorological observations are published, extra copies of these alone
for circulation among meteorologists ? and how are they to be circulated ?

and who to bear the expense ?
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL. OBSERVATIONS. 13

   Would it be advisable to recommend to the General Committee to appoint
M. Erman to act as a committee to superintend the calculation of the
Gaussian constants for 1829, with a grant of £50 per annum for two years

according to his proposal ?

   Would it be advisable to accept M. Dove's offer to reduce one station's
meteorological observations in the mode proposed by him, and to call on
other members or others who may be disposed to follow his example, and to
request them to act as a committee with or without money at disposal to do so
on the system to be proposed by M. Dove ?

   Is there any one ready to undertake a climatology of England according
to M. Dove's suggestion ?

    Professor Bache proposes general hourly observations for a year all over
America, to commence a year hence [ ? exact day . . .], would it be right to
call upon private observers or public bodies to do the same in Europe, and
in that case to guarantee their publication ?

   Is there any decided improvement capable of being suggested in the mode

of publication of the colonial observations?

   Your Committee further report, that they have expended out of the grant
of £50 placed at their disposal the amount of £16 16*. 8d., and request a
continuance of the grant.

                            Signed on the part of the Committee,

I. Circular addressed by Sir John Herschel, on the part of the Com-
   mittee appointed to conduct the co-operation of the British Asso-
   ciation in the system of Magnetical and Meteorological Observa-

     tions.
                                                                                                           December 5, 1844.

  --Sir, It being understood that the term for which the British Government

and East India Company have pledged their support of the British magnetic
and meteorological establishments expires with the year 1845, so that, unless re-

newed, the British co-operation in those observations, on its present extensive

--footing, will cease with the expiration of that year ; and the Committee of

the British Association for the advancement of Science, appointed to conduct
the co-operation of the Association in that system of observations, having to
make, at the next meeting of the Association in June 1845, a general report
on the progress made and the objects accomplished by the several establish-
ments in Europe and elsewhere (so far as they shall be in possession of the
necessary information), in which report this circumstance will necessarily
be adverted to, they request the favour of your consideration of and reply to
the following inquiries.

   1st. Whether in your judgement there are any, and if so, what important
objects to be accomplished by a continuance of the existing establishments

--for a longer period, executing as at present both systematic and simultane-

ous observations, or either class to the exclusion of the other ?

   2nd. Do you consider that private research has to any useful and valuable

degree been stimulated by the example of the government establishments in
Europe and elsewhere, and that science has thereby received material con-
tributions which would probably not otlierwise have arisen ? and can you state

instances ?
--14 REPORT 1845.

3rd. In case of the continuance of the observatories beyond 1845, would

you be disposed to recommend any, and what modifications, extensions or

alterations in the system of observing, or in the apparatus to be employed ?

The full and free communication of your views in reply to these inquiries and

on every part of the general subject, is very particularly requested ; and the

Committee will also gladly be informed whether you will object to your reply

to this letter being printed entire, or in part (by extracts) for mutual circula-

tion, in continuance of this correspondence, should it appear to the Committee

to be necessary.

   They further request that you will so time your reply that it may reach

London before the 10th of March 1845, and tiiat you will address it by post to

                       Lieut.-Colonel Sabine, R.A.,

                       Woolwich,

Magnetic Committee.    England.

Before the end of the current year, the first volume of the Observations at

the British government stations, and the second of those at Greenwich, will

Abe forwarded to you.  volume of extraordinary magnetic disturbances at

the former stations, and the first volume of the Greenwich Observations, have

already been so forwarded, and it is hoped duly received.

I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration,

                       Sir, your very obedient servant,

    THE LETTERS WHICH FOLLOW ARE REPLIES TO THE ABOVE

                                          CIRCULAR.

                    II. Professor Wilhelm Weber to Colonel Sabine.

                                                                                                    Leipzic, 1845, February 20.

 --HocHGEEHRTER Herr, Ich wciss, dassichlhnen auf die vom Magnetic

Committee vorgelegten Fragen keine Antwort geben kann, welche irgend
wichtige und neue Notizen fiir Sie enthielte ; dennoch verfehle ich nicht, der
mir gewordenen Aufforderung zu entsprechen, indem ich Ihnen ganz anheim
stelle ob und welchen Gebrauch Sie davon machen wollen.

   I. Wir setzen wohl AUe das Vertrauen in diejenigen Regierungen, welche
zur Begrundung systematischer magnetischer Beobachtungen auf der Erd-

oberflache beigetragen haben, dass sie auch den regelmdssigen Fortgang dieser
systematischen Beobachtungen fiir die Zukunft sichern werden. In diesem
Vertrauen habe auch icii die Errichtung eines magnetischen Observatoriums
kiirzlich noch hier in Leipzig betrieben. Das in den ersten 6 Jahren ausge-
fiihrte System von Beobachtungen ist ein sehr umfassendes gewesen, welches
darauf berechnet war aUe7i Forderungen zu geniigen, sowohl denen welche
aus der bleibenden Avfgabe entspringen, zu deren Losung jedes Jahr und jedes
Zeitalter seinen Beitrag liefern soil, als auch denen, welche in einer Menge
voriibergehender oder ein fiir allemal zu Icisender Aufgaben begriindet waren.
Welche Aufgaben der letzteren Art nach Ablauf der ersten 6 Jahre nun
schon als voUkommen gelost und erledigt betrachtet werden diirlen, dariiber
steht uns hier noch kein Urtheil zu ; aber die Magnetic Committee wird

vielleicht jetzt schon ein Urtheil dariiber aus den ihr allein vorliegenden Ma-
terialien fallen konnen. Es muss daher der Magnetic Committee die Ent-

scheidung iiberlassen bleiben, welche Forderungen in Betreff jener Art vor-
iibergehender Aufgaben an die Zukunft noch iibrig bleiben, und ich beschranke
mich auf eine Antwort darauf, ob die bleibende Aufgabe fiir sich allein die
fernere Beibehaltung des ganzen Beobachtungs- Systems erfordere, welches
      ON MAGNKTICAIi AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 15

fiir die ersten 6 Jahre angenommen worden war. Wenn es sich kiinftig
einmal nur noch um die stets hleibende Aufgabe handelt, namlich

    von Jahr zu Jahr die Veranderungen genau zu bestimnien, welche in den
    vier und zwanzig (kiinftig vielleicht 35) Elementen der Erdmagnetismus-
    Theorie Platz nehmen
so werden wie icii glaube dann betrachtliche Reductionen in dem obigen sehr
    umfassenden Systerae vorgenommen werden diirfen.
    Nothwendig fiir diese bleibende Aufgabe scheint mir
1. Die Erhaltung aller Observatorien auf entfernten Stationen ausser Europa;
2. Die regelmassige (monatliche) Wiederholung aller absoluten Messungen in
     alien diesen Observatorien.

    Nicht nothivendig fiir diese bleibende Aufgabe betraehte ich dagegen.

--1. Die bisherigen Termins-Beobachtungen die vielleicht kiinftig auf die

    europaischen Stationen beschrankt werden diirften ;

--2. Die zweistiindigen taglichen Beobachtuugen die sich dann vielleicht auf

    achtstiindige reduciren liessen.

   Kurz es scheint mir moglich, wenn man wirklich so Aveit gelangt ist, dass
bloss die bleibende Aufgabe noch in Riicksicht kommt, das System der Beo-
bachtungen in der Art zu vereinfachen, dass Ein wohl unterrichtetes und
geiibter Beobachter aufjedem Observatorium geniigt und keines Assistenten
bedarf. Ein solches beschrankteres System von Beobachtungen muss stets
ununterbrochen fortgesetzt werden, wenn die Geschichte des Erdmagnetismus
kein blosses Stlickwerk bleiben soil und wenn die darauf beruhenden magne-
tischen Karten diejenige Pracision und Planmassigkeit erlangen soUen, welche
sie fiir die Praxis so niitzlich machen wiirden.

   II. Was den miltelbaren Erfolg betrifft, welcher die systematische Betreib-
ung der magnetischen Beobachtungen durch Anregung und Forderung an-

derer wissenchaftlicher Bestrebungen gehabt habe, so lassen sich zwar diese
Wirkungen schon jetzt nicht verkennen, doch bedijrfen dieselben Zeit zu

weiterer Entfaltung, bevor man ihren ganzen Urafang und ihre voile Wich-

tigkeit iibersehen kann.

    In Deutschland z. B. existirten bisher blosse Sammlungen physikalischer
Instrumente ohne feste Einrichtungen zu ihrer Benutzung, es gab keine phy-
sikalischen Laboratorien und Observatorien. Solche Laboratorien und Obser-
vatorien, welche fiir die Fortschritte der Wissenschaftunentbehrlich geworden
sind, fangen jetzt an zu entstehen, und die den magnetischen Beobachtungen
gemachten Bewilligungen geben dabei einen festen und sicheren StUtzpunct,
wie ich aus eigener Erfahrung bezeugen kann. Seitdem ferner die magne-
tischen Beobachtungen ihre neuere Ausbildung und Vollendung gewonnen
haben, haben wir in Deutschland mehrfach begonnen, die galvanischen Beo-
bachtungen analogen Principien zu unterwerfen und wir haben auch dafiir
absolute Maase eingef iihrt. Fiir alle diese Untersuchungen bilden aber die
magnetischen Beobachtungen nothwendige Elemente, die dabei als gegeben
betrachtet werden miissen. Die magnetischen Beobachtungen sind daher
nicht bloss zur Erforschung des Erdmagnetismus nothwendig, sondern sie sind
jetzt auch ein wichtiges Element i'ViVviele andere physikalische Untersuchung-

en geworden. An unseren Universitaten wird eudlich die Wichtigkeit im-

mer mehr erkannt, welche die Bildung exacfer JVatur- Beobachter fiir die
Wissenschaft und fiir das practische Leben hat. Bisher bot nur die Astro-
nomic eine sehr einseitige Gelegenheit zur Bildung feiner Beobachter dar,
welche nur von Wenigen benutzt werden konnte. Die Erfahrung hat be-
wiesen, dass magnetische Observatorien zu vortrefflichen Bildungs-Anstalten
fiir Beobachter dienen konnen.

   III. Was die Instrumente betrijBft, so scheint mir, wenn die bisherigen Re-
16 REPORT 1845.

sultate den Erwartungen der Magnetic Committee entsprechen sollten, kein
Grund zu einer Aenderung voi'zuliegen ; selbst aber wenn hie und da die
Erwartungen der Magnetic Committee in den Resultaten sich getiiuscht
fiinden, wiirde ich doch die Uberzeugung hegen, dass die Schuld davon (die
verticalen Variationen ausgenommen) nicht in den Instrumenten, sondern in
Mangel kunstgerechter Behandlung einzelner Beobachter zu suchen sei; und
dass daher durch Vertiiuschung der Instrumente die Sache eher verschlim-
mert als verbessert werden mcichte, weil jeder neue Instrument eine neue
kunstgerechte Behandlung fordern wiirde. Mir scheint es in jeder Beziehung
rathsam, die bisherigen Instrumente im Wesentlichen beizubehalten. Doch
wiirde ich es fiir sehr niitzlich halten, wenn haufiger die Gelegenheit be-
nutzt wiirde, dass Magnetstabe, deren Schwingungsdauer(und Temperatur) in

dem einen magnetischen Observatorium genau geniessen worden ware, nach
einem anderen Observatorium versandt m urden, um ihre Schwingungsdauer
audi dort messen zu lassen, und umgekehrt. Es wiirde dadurch eine Con-
trole fiir die absoluten Intensitjitsmessungen gewonnen werden, welche von
Wichtigkeit wiire so lange man noch nicht uberall auf eine ganz zuverlassige
Ausfiihrung der absoluten Messungen soUte trauen konnen.

   Ich benutze diese Gelegenheit, Ihnen, Hochgeehrter Herr, meinen Dank
fur den Empfang des Isten Bandes Observations on days of unusual Mag-

netic Disturbance, fiir mich sowohl als fiir das hiesige Observatorium auszu-
sprechen; dagegen bemerke ich, dass die anderen im Schreiben des Magnetic
Committee genannten Biicher mir bisher nicht zugekommen sind, namlich
the 1st and the 2nd volume of the Greenwich Observations, and the 1st
volume of the Observations at the Government Stations.

                                                  Mit wahrer Hochachtung

                                                                        Ihr stets ergebenster,

                                                                     WiLHELM Weber.

                                    ( Translation.)

                                                                                                         Leipsic, February 20, 1845.

 --Dear Sir, I know that I cannot return any answers to the questions pro-

posed by the Magnetic Committee which shall contain any important matter

new to you ; I will not however omit to send a reply, leaving it to yourself to
make use of it or not in any way you may see fit.

  WeI. have all confidence in those governments who have aided in esta-

blishing systematic magnetic observations over the surface of the earth, that

they will assure the regular continuance of these systematic observations for
the future. In this confidence I have recently promoted the establishment of

a magnetic observatory here in Leipsic. The system of observation executed

during the first six years has been a very comprehensive one, calculated to
satisfy all demands, both those which arise out of the permane7it problem to

the solution of which every year and every epoch ought to furnish its share,

and also those which had respect to a number of temporal-?/ pi-oblems, or such

as may be solved once for all. In regard to this latter class of problems, we

have here no means of judging which of them may be already considered as

completely  satisfied  and  solved  by  means  of  the work  of  the first  six  years
                                                                                                          ;

but the Magnetic Committee may perhaps already possess tlie materials on

which to found such a judgement. It must therefore remain for them to de-

cide what demands may still remain to be satisfied in respect to the tempo-

raiy problems referred to ; I confine myself to the consideration w-hether the
continuation of the whole observation system adopted for the first six years

is i-equired for the permanent problem only, this problem being,

   To determine accurately, year by year, the changes taking place in the
       ----; ; ;

ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 17

twenty-four (perhaps in future thirty-five) elements of the ' Erdmagne-

        tismus-Theorie.'

I believe that as far as this object is concerned considerable reductions may

be made in the above very comprehensive system.

   It appears to me necessary for the permanent problem,
   1st. To preserve all the observatories at remote stations out of Europe
   2nd. To repeat regularly (every month) all absolute measurements at all

these observatories.

I consider it unnecessary for this object to continue,

1st. The term observations, which "may perhaps in future be confined to

    European stations
2nd. The two-hourly daily observations, which may perhaps be reduced to

         eight-hourly.

   In short, it seems to me that, supposing we have really been so successful
that nothing but the permanent problem remains, we may so far simplify our

system that one well-instructed and practised observer at each observatory
will suffice and will need no assistants. Such a limited system of observation
must be constantly continued without interruption, if the history of terrestrial
magnetism is to be no mere fragmentary work ; and if the magnetic maps
based upon it are to possess that precision and conformity to system which

would make them so useful in praxis.
    II. In regard to the indirect results which the systematic prosecution of

magnetic observations may have had in exciting and furthering other scien-

tific efforts, such effects are already unmistakeably recognizable, but they re-
quire time for their further development before their whole extent and full
importance can be seen. In Germany, for example, there existed hitherto
mere collections of physical instruments without arrangements for their use
there were no physical laboratories and observatories : these, which are be-

come indispensable to the progress of science, are now beginning to arise, and
for this the arrangements made for magnetic observations afford a solid and
secure point d'appui, as I can testify from my own experience. Further,
since magnetic observations have received their recent improvement and com-
pleteness, we have begun in several places in Germany to subject galvanic
observations to analogous principles, and have introduced for them also abso-

lute measure ; but for all these researches magnetic observations afford neces-
sary elements which must be regarded as data. Magnetic observations are

therefore not only necessary for terrestrial magnetism, but are besides now
become an important element ybr many other physical investigations. There

is at our universities a growing recognition of the importance, both for science

and for practical life, of forming exact observers of nature. Hitherto astro-
nomy alone has afforded a very partial opportunity for the formation of fine
observers, of which few could avail themselves. Experience has shown that

magnetic observatories may serve as excellent training-schools in this respect.
   III. In regard to instruments, it appears to me that if the results obtained

shall be found to correspond to the expectations of the Magnetic Committee,

there will be no ground for alteration ; and even if these expectations shall

have been occasionally disappointed, I should yet be persuaded that (except

in regard to vertical variations) the cause would be found to be not in the

instruments, but in the unskilful handling of particular observers, aud that

a change of instruments would be likely to do more harm than good, as every

new instrument requires a new skilful mode of handling. In every point of
view it seems to me advisable to retain the present instruments without ma-
terial alteration. But I should think it very desirable to take more frequent

opportunities of sending magnetic bars, whose time of vibration (and correc-

1845.                 c
                                          :;

tion for temperature) had been exactly determined at one observatory, to
other observatories where the time of vibration should be also determined and
the bars sent back ; thus affording a check on the absolute measurements of
intensity, which is of importance until we can confide entirely in the thoroughly
good execution of the absolute measurements at all the stations.

   I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks, botli for myself and for the

observatory at this place, for the first volume of 'Observations on Days of un-
usual Magnetic Disturbance : ' the other works mentioned in the letter of the
Magnetic Committee, viz. the first and second volumes of the 'Greenwich Ob-
servations,' and the first volume of the 'Observations at the Government Sta-
tions,' have not yet reached me.

                                          With sincere esteem, always yours,

                                                                      WiLHELM Weber.

III. From M. Kupffer, Director- General of the Magnetic Observatories in

                                    Russia, to Sir John Herschel.

  --Monsieur le President, En riponse a votre lettre du 5 Decembre 1844,

j'ai I'honneur de vous adresser les remarques suivantes sur les trois points y
contenus

    1°. Selon moi, nous ne sorames, relativement a nos connaissances magne-
tiques, qu'a I'entree d'une nouvelle carriere, d'un nouveau champ d'exploita-
tion, qui s'etend indefinement devant nous. Voici effectivement, en peu de
mots, ce que nous savons deja par nos observations, et ce que nous ne pou-
vons apprendre que par des observations ulterieures.

    Nous possedons une excellente methode pour determiner la declinaison
absolue et ses variations, et nous avons etudie avec un soin extreme cet ele-
ment important du magnetisme terrestre ; nous avons constate et determine
plus exactement les rapports intimes qui existent entre les variations offertes
par la position de I'aiguille sur des points tres distans de la surface terrestre
nous trouverons peut-etre meme deja, par une discussion plus approfondie de
nos observations, les lois qui regissent ces phenomenes, et les causes aux
quelles on pent les attribuer. Mais nous sommes bien eloignes de poss6der
des methodes aussi exactes pour I'observation des deux autres elemens du
magnetisme terrestre. Nous savons bien determiner la valeur absolue de
I'intensite et ses variations, dans leur composante horizontale, mais I'observa-
tion de la valeur absolue de I'intensite totale et de I'inclinaison, et de leurs
variations ont encore offert des obstacles insurniontables aux efforts les plus
perseverans. D'un autre cote, il n'y a pas lieu de renoncer a I'espoir de re-
ussir prochainement; la theorie des inductions electriques nous ouvre une
nouvelle route et une perspective de succes.

    Outre cela, nos observations memes nous ont fait voir, d'une maniere non
douteuse, que la marche de I'aiguille presente, a cote des phenomenes gene-

raux, dont la simultaneite sur une grande portion de la surface terrestre a et6
 demontree par des observations anterieures, des irregularites locales, dont la
 cause nous est encore entierement iuconnue et dont les rapports probables
 avec les phenomenes meteorologiques sont encore a decouvrir.

    II y a done encore beaucoup a faire et la matiere est bien loin d'etre epui-

see ; il me semble au contraire, que la solution du probleme, que nous nous
sommes propose, n'a ete qu'ebauchee.

    Mais qu'y a-t-il encore a faire ? La rapidite de notre marche nous a em-
peche de regarder en arriere, nous ne savons pas encore bien nous memes, a
quels resultats nous sommes arrives ; une reunion des observateurs les plus
ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 19

actifs et les plus influens, qui ont pris part a notre entreprise, est devenu in-

dispensable, pour discuter la marche a suivre.

    k°. Pour repondre a cette question, il sera necessaire d'etablir avant tout
le point de vue, dont la science en general est envisagee par notre gouverne-

ment. En Angleterre, la science a eclaire d'abord, et regie ensuite la marche

d'une civilisation indigene, elle en est le resultat et la fleur pour ainsi dire, et
reclame le secours du gouverneraent dans quelques cas seulement, ou yil a

de tres fortes depenses a faire. La Russie, etant venue plus tard, a pu pro-

fiter du travail intellectuel de toute I'Europe, elle a re^u chez elle la science
toute faite, comme une chose, dont I'utiiite est generalement reconnue, et
comme un des plus beaux ornemens de sa grandeur. Voila pourquoi le
gouverneraent russe cherche les hommes de science et est pour ainsi dire

jaloux que rien de vraiment utile et bon ne se fasse en dehors de son influence.
11 est facile de comprendre I'avantage de ce principe ; il y a unitg partout et
11 n'y a jamais double emploi ; la science n'est pas la seule a y gagner, I'etat y

gagne aussi, parceque les memes choses se font plus rapidement, plus sure-

ment et avec moins de depenses.

II n'est done pas etonnant qu'il n'y a que fort peu d'hommes prives, qui se

soient occupes d'observations meteorologiques, et pas un, qui ait consacr6

une partie de ses moyens et de son temps aux observations magnetiques.

Mr. Anatole Demidoff' a Stabli un observatoire meteorologique a Nigeney-

tagnilsk dans I'Oural; Mr. Ougritchitch-Trebinsky, directeur de la douane a

Taganrog, fait des observations meteorologiques a 23 pieds au dessus du ni-

veau de la mer noire ; nous avons plusieurs annees d'observations thermome-

triques faites a Yakoutzk par le Sieur NeverofF negociant ; un autre, simple

agriculteur, le Sieur Semenoff fait des observations meteorologiques tres com-

pletes a Koursk (midi de   la Russie) ;    Mr. Kalk en  fait  a  Baltischport                                              plu-
                                                                                                                        ;

sieurs medecins en font dans ies lieux respectifs de leurs residences. II est

en general facile de voir, que le gout des observations meteorologiques a fait
de grands progres en Russie, depuis I'etablissement de nos observatoires mag-
netiques et meteorologiques, qui, d'ailleurs, date deja chez nous de 1835;
I'archive meteorologique de I'Academie des Sciences, dans lequel se concen-

trent toutes les observations meteorologiques faites hors de notre entreprise

magnetique, contient deja des series plus ou moins completes de 75 points,

situes dans toute I'etendue de I'Empire. II faut encore dire que le gouverne-

ment a bien fourni des instrumens a presque toutes ces stations, mais toujours

sur la demande des personnes qui ont voulu se charger de ces observations,

et qu'il n'a donne aucune retribution personnelle.

    3°. Quant aux modifications, qu'il y aurait a faire au plan des observations
je crois qu'une convocation de tous les directeurs generaux (un representant

au moins pour chaque pays) : et d'autant de directeurs speciaux, qu'il sera
possible de reunir, est- indispensable, pour discuter a fond cette importante

question. Je pense que la reunion de I'Association Britannique a Cambridge,

qui aura lieu cette annee, ofFre une excellente occasion, qu'il ne faut pas

laisser passer.

   En vous priant, Monsieur de bien vouloir communiquer ces remarques au

Comite, dont vous etes le president, et en vous autorisant de les faire impri-

mer, si vous le jugez convenable, j'ai I'honneur d'etre avec la consideration la

plus distinguee et les horamages les plus alFectueux.

--20 REPORT 1845.

 IV. From Professor Loomis of Neio York University to Lieut.- Col. Sabine.

                                                                 New York University, Feb. 28, 1845.

  --Dear Sir, Having been invited to express my opinion respecting the im-

portance of continuing the establishments so Hberally set on foot by the
British government for magnetic and meteorological observations, while I
admire the liberal policy of the government in what has already been done,

I do not hesitate to express it as my conviction, that the immediate abandon-

ment of these establishments would prove highly prejudicial to the cause of
science. The present combined movement for magnetic observations had for
its object the discovery of the cmise of all terrestrial magnetic phsenomena.
This was to be accomplished by simultaneous observations of each of the
magnetic elements at numerous stations scattered over the globe. The
observations however must not only be made, tiiey must all be brought to-
gether, compared, discussed, interrogated, before we can know what lan-
guage they speak ; they must be published and placed in the hands of all who
are interested in the subject. The observations themselves constitute but the
raw material; they are of little value until they are reduced, and it is dis-
covered what general truths can be derived from them.

    But it may be asked, whether, having made our observations, we may not
now safely pause until we have ascertained what results they are to furnish ?
To this there are numerous objections ; one of which is, that to suspend tem-
porarily the present system of observations, would in many cases lead to their
entire abandonment. But have not observations already been made sufficient

to secure the object originally proposed ? I presume no one is ready to
answer this question in the affirmative. It commonly happens in experimental
research, that after a series of fortunate experiments which have shed light
on what was before shrouded in mystery, a careful comparison of all the ex-
periments suggests some new combination, which, like an experimentum crucis,
would enable us finally to decide between conflicting theories. It is not

Areasonable to anticipate any better success in our magnetic researches.

discussion of the past observations will suggest plausible explanations which
are consistent perhaps M'ith all the observed phaenomena ; but to preclude all

objections, it may be necessary to observe the phenomena under varied cir-
cumstances perhaps at new stations peculiarly situated, perhaps with pecu-

                                                             ;

liar instruments. To abandon the present system, therefore, before a thorough
discussion has been undertaken of the observations already made, may be to
stop short in the race when the prize is just within our reach. Let the obser-
vations be published as rapidly as possible, let them be freely circulated.
When the object for which the observatories were founded has been shown to
be attained, then let them be dismantled. But suppose they are abandoned
forthwith, and after a comparison of all the observations, we arrive at the pro-
bable clue to all the phaenomena of terrestrial magnetism ; but still some doubt
remains, which however might probably be cleared up by a further continu-
ance of the observations, with perhaps some slight modifications suggested by
experience. Should we not condemn that ill-judged ceconomy, which, after

forming a liberal plan for the accomplishment of a glorious end, stopped short
in its execution before ascertaining whether or not the object in view had been
attained ? Surely it is the dictate of wisdom to hold on to the present posi-
tions until we have ascertained whether the enemy has really surrendered
and if he still holds out, let us inquire whether a different system of tactics
would not promise better success. Let us not then abandon our present posts

until we ascertain that our objects are accomplished, or until it is clear that

success is not to be expected.
ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 21

In the progress of my own researches, I have been particularly impressed

with the importance of the observatory at Toronto. In an article published

in the ' American Journal of Science,' vol. xliii. p. 93, I attempted to deter-

mine the annual change of dip in the United States ; I found the materials

for this investigation exceedingly meagre. It is of the utmost importance

that there should be a few central stations where the mean annual motions of

all the magnetic elements are accurately measured, as only in this way can
observations made at scattered stations be reduced to a common epoch.

The meteorological observations made at Toronto are perhaps no less im-

portant than the magnetic. Having lately undertaken to investigate two storms

which occurred in February 184"^, my attention has been particularly called

to this subject. I collected observations as far as practicable from every part

of the United States and the adjoining British possessions. The observations

at Toronto were pre-eminent for their accuracy and completeness ; they were
made every two hours of the twenty-four, whereas at few other stations were

there more than three or four daily observations. I attempted to analyse the

phaenomena on a somewhat novel plan, which rendered the utmost accuracy

desirable in all the observations of the barometer, thermometer, wind, &c.

It is believed that a continuance of these observations promises important re-

sults to the science of meteorology. Observers are now organized all over

the United States, so that any storm which is embraced within our limits can

be pretty fully investigated. But our great winter storms, whose features are

the most strongly marked, and which are therefore best suited to inquiries of

this kind, are of vast dimensions. On the morning of Feb. 3, 1842, rain was

falling throughout nearly every portion of the United States, from an unknown

distance in the Atlantic to far beyond the Mississippi, and from the Gulf of

Mexico northward to an unknown distance beyond Lake Superior. The area

upon which rain is ascertained to have been simultaneously falling was more

than 1400 miles in a north and south direction. Now in order to exhibit a

complete analysis of a storm, we need observations embracing its wlioJe extent,

otherwise we are obliged to supply deficiencies by conjecture. But almost all

our great winter storms project over the British possessions on the north of us

to an unknown extent ; that is, it is seldom we have an opportunity to inves-

tigate the phasnomena of a great storm on its northern limit. The storms ex-

Wetend northward beyond our present posts of observation.  have one station

want a chain of meteorological posts extending indefinitely northward from

the great lakes across the British possessions. There is nothing which would

hold out a prospect of so rich a harvest to American meteorology as the

establishment of such a chain of posts ; this can only be effected through the
agency of the British government. It would be desirable to have stations at

intervals of 100 miles extending northward to the furthest outpost of civiliza-

tion. Ten pounds will provide a station with instruments, and with a little

pains-taking, competent men might probably be found to make the observa-

tions gratuitously. The United States are admirably situated for a grand

Wemeteorological crusade.  have here a vast territory, covered by a popu-

Welation all speaking the same language.  have more than a hundred ob-

servers who are now keeping registers, besides the observations at sixty mili-

tary posts, mostly situated on the frontier. With a generous cooperation on

the part of the British government in procuring registers from their extensive

possessions north of the United States, our own observers would be inspired

with new enthusiasm, and we might speedily hope for richer conquests than

have been hitherto known in the domain of meteorology. Moreover, the pro-

gress made in American meteorology is not exclusively of local value ; a law

of nature in America must be a law in Europe ; so that every new principle
here developed is the common property of the scientific world.

                                  With much respect I remain, yours truly,
                                                                                         Elias Loomis.

V. Dr. Lamont, Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory
                                  at Munich, to Lieut.- Col. Sabine.

                                                                                             Munich, March 1, 1845.

  My --dear Sir, In reply to the letter addressed to me by the Committee

of the British Association appointed to conduct the cooperation of the Asso-
ciation with regard to magnetic observatories, I have in the first place to
regret, that, with the exception of one volume of the ' Greenwich Observa-
tions,' and the first part of the ' Observations on Days of unusual Magnetic

Disturbance,' no observations made at the British or colonial observatories

have come to my knowledge ; and though from the dispositions that have

been made I have no doubt that the results will be found to answer the dif-
ferent purposes of theoretical investigation, yet I cannot consider myself en-
titled to express as yet any positive opinion on the subject*.

   The same question however that is now to be decided by the Committee of
the British Association, viz. whether and in what manner the magnetic obser-
vations ought to be continued after 1 845, 1 have been for some time consider-
ing myself with regard to our own observatory, and after a careful review of
our results, and others that have come to my knowledge, I have resolved on

the following plan :

    1 At the end of this year I will give up the present system of two-hourly
observations, and will make only three or four observations a-day ; the times
of observation to be disposed in such a manner as will seem most advan-
tageous for obtaining the daily range and the monthly means. As for the
term days, they were observed at Munich only to the end of 1842, and then

discontinued, from the reasons I mentioned in my report to the Academy

(published in the ' Gelehrte Anzeigen') ; the same reasons are also mentioned
in the ' Bulletins de 1' Academic Royale de Bruxelles' (vol. x. p. i. 178).

    2. I will determine the absolute values of the different magnetic elements
from time to time as has been done hitherto, both in the observatory and its

immediate vicinity, and will endeavour to extend my observations to other

parts of the country as far as circumstances will permit.
    3. Investigations respecting the construction of instruments and the methods

of observation will be continued. It would, in my opinion, be a great advan-

tage to science, and is also I believe possible, to render the results less liable
to error and the methods more simple than they now are.

    4. I will endeavour to have the magnetic observatory kept exactly in its
present state with regard to the instruments and their arrangement, in order
that, if anv circumstance be afterwards found to have influence on the obser-

vations, the amount may be determined and the results corrected. Causes of
error might yet be discovered, the effects of which it would be impossible to
determine, except with the same instrument and in the same place.

    I have given this account of the system I myself intend to pursue, in order

that the Committee may judge how far it might seem expedient to arrange the
British and colonial observatories for two or three years to come on a similar
plan, reducing at the same time the personal establishment to one or two as-
sistants besides the director. On computing my own observations and those

      * Dr. Lamont's opinion on this subject is contained in a subsequent letter, No. XVII.
ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 23

of different other places, I have lately remarked a circumstance that seems

to me in the present discussion not unworthy of attention, viz. that the form

of the daily curves, as given by the monthly means, is nearly the same every

year, while the magnitude of the curves or the mean daily range differs con-

siderably from one year to another ; thus, for instance, the curve representing

the daily changes of declination for the month of August 184-1 resembles very

nearly the curve of the same month in 1842, but the ordinates in the former

year are much greater ; in other words, the law according to which the sun

produced the daily changes was the same in both years, but the force (repre-

sented by the ordinates, the greatest of which is equal to the daily range) was

not the same. On this account the daily range may be considered as the

most important magnetic element ; and what is most likely to lead us to a dis-

covery of the causes of magnetic phaenomena is a careful investigation of the

circumstances (probably meteorological) on which the daily range depends.

Similar considerations apply to the secular changes, which present remarkable

irregularities from one month to another ; these irregularities (not the secular

change itself) are probably connected with the same or similar causes as the

differences of the daily range. I intend, as I mentioned before, that the ob-

servations of our establishment shall be for some years to come particularly

directed to these points ; and I am inclined to suppose that a similar system,

if followed in the British and colonial observatories, would prove not only in

this, but also in other respects, beneficial to the magnetic inquiry. The daily

work of magnetic observatories has been hitherto so considerable, that little

time was afforded for different minute investigations, that nevertheless are of

great importance for the final results. By diminishing the daily work as I

have mentioned, ample time will be afforded for various investigations respect-

ing instruments, methods and probable errors ; the different methods of deter-

mining the absolute horizontal force and inclination may be tried and the

results compared ; the constants of the instruments may be determined by

repeated experiments and the probable errors ascertained ; experiments may

be made to determine the effects of the temperature and moisture of the air

on the suspension, the difference between the temperature indicated by the

thermometer of the bifilar and the true temperature of the bar, together with

the corrections depending on this difference, &c. Besides, if the observations

(which I would think it important to publish with as little delay as possible)

should at any place show anomalies or peculiarities, new observations may be

made to any extent that may seem necessary for obtaining a decisive result.

These I believe are the considerations that may be urged for continuing all
the magnetic establishments as they now are, but on a reduced scale. As to

the question whether the present system of observations should be continued

without alteration, I will simply express my opinion that I do not think it ad-

visable, and will not attempt to give reasons for this opinion, because I believe
1 agree on this point with all those who have taken active part in the mag-

netic inquiry.

   There is one point alluded to in the letter of the Committee on which I
will add a few words; I mean the powerful influence which the example of

the British government has had in promoting in other countries the important

Abranch of science now under consideration.  general interest in the pro-

gress of science, and, above all, a willingness evinced in almost every country

to take part in scientific enterprises that seem to require general cooperation,

may be considei-ed as characteristic of the present time, at least the effects

Ahave not at any former period been so conspicuously manifested.  plan of

great utility for science, if judiciously arranged and once realized to a certain

extent, can scarcely fail to obtain not only the support of scientific men in

every quarter, but also the countenance of the governments, which in most

countries is indispensable for every great undertaking. In establishing a

chain of regular magnetic observatories to be extended over the different

parts of the  globe,  the  first and  most  powerful  impulse  was given  in  England
                                                                                                                ;

and I think it may be justly asserted, that all that has been done in magnetism

during the last six years is in some degree to be attributed to the example of

the British government, and the zeal and energy with which the vast enter-

prise, once resolved upon, was carried into effect.

                             Believe me, my dear Sir, yours most sincerely,

                                                                              Lamont.

   P.S. I do not think that I have been able to answer satisfactorily any of
the questions proposed by the Committee ; if however it were thought expe-
dient to publish any part of this letter, I have no objection.

                                                                                                    Berlin, Marz 1, 1845.

 --Dear Sir, Die Antwort auf die von Sir John Herschel mir vorge-

legten Fragen habe ich deutsch beantwortet, da jeder sich in seiner Mutter-

sprache wohl am praecisesten ausdriickt. Ich hoffe, dass sie noch zu rechter Zeit
in London ankommen werden, obgleich seit einigen Tagen alle unsre Eisen-

bahnen in Schnee vergraben sind und selbst vermittelst des Militars noch nicht
haben frei gemacht werden konnen. Ich sage Ihnen meinen herzlichen Dank
fiir die mir aiisserst interessante Schrift ' Meteorology of Toronto,' in der Sie
so freundlich meiner Arbeiten gedacht haben. Auch danke ich Hr. Riddell
freundichst fiir die iibersendeten Magnetical Instructions. Leider habe ich

nichts entgegenzusenden, da der vierte Theil meines "Non-periodic Variations

in the Distribution of Temperature on the surface of the Earth between 1729

and IS-iS," erst im Laufe des Sommers erscheinen wird.
   In dem Briefe von Sir John Herschel erfahre ich, dass an mich a volume

of Extraordinary Magnetic Disturbances at the British Government Stations,
and the 1st volume of the ' Greenwich Observations' abgesendet worden sind,
und dass ich the 1st volume of the ' Observations at the British Government
Stations,' and the 2nd of those at Greenwich, erhalten werde. Leider habe ich
nur die Magnetic Disturbances erhalten, wofiir ich meinen herzlichen Dank

abstatte.

    Sollte es gewiinscht werden, dass ich an den Berechnungen der meteorolo-
gischen Observationen Antheil nehme, so stelle ich meine Thatigkeit gern zur

Disposition des Committee.
    Bei den non-periodic variations habe ich oft Gelegenheit gehabt, zu be-

dauern,dass mir in England erschienene Beobachtungs-journale nicht zugiing-
lich waren. Sollte es nicht raoglich seyn, dass jemand im Auftrage des Bri-
tish Association eine Climatologie von England schreibe, in welche die mo-
natliche Mittel der einzelnen Jahre der verschiedenen Beobachtungs-stationen
abgedruckt wiirden, wozu meine Arbeit doch bereits eine Vorarbeit ist. Sollte
es ferner nicht zweckmassig seyn, wenn meteorologische Journale, welche den
Transactions der Learned Societies und den philosophical Journals beigedruckt

werden, in mehr Exemplaren abgezogen wiirden um nachher als selbststandige

Jahrgange in Druck zu kommen. Wie unendlich viel Zeit wiirde gewonnen
werden, wenn man nicht mehr gezwungen ware sich jeden einzelnen Monat in
einem besondern Bande aufzusuchen, der, wenn er in einer offentlichen Bi-
bliothek gerade verliehen ist eine Arbeit oft Monate lang unterbricht. Ein
von der British Association ausgehender Vorschlag wurde dann wohl auch in
ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 25

andern Landern Nachahmung findern, und man wurde in der Folge schneller

die Wissenschaft durch Arbeiten iordern konnen.

I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration,

Your very obedient servant,                      H. W. Dove.

    Die Aufgabe, welche meteorologische Observatorien zu Idsen haben, ist eine
dreifache, sie sollen die mittlern Werthe liefern, die empirischen Gesetze

ihrer periodischen Verjinderungen, endlich Data an die Hand geben, um die

gleichzeitige Verbreitung einer meteorologischen Erscheinung und ihr Fort-

schreiteii liber die Oberflache der Erde auffinden zu konnen.

   Da die Mittel nur nach Elimination der periodischen Veranderungen
erhalten werden konnen, so kommt es zunachst auf die Feststellung dieser

an. Dazu sind stLindliche Beobachtungen unerlasslich, fiir Temperatur, Druck

und Feuchtigkeit. Da aber der Spielraum der taglichen Oscillationen bei
triibem Wetter viel geringer als bei heiterm, der Gang der taglichen barome-

trischen Veranderungen in beiden Fallen sogar ein verschiedener, so scheinen

zur Feststellung der Gesetze derselben mehrere Jahre unerlasslich. Auch

konnen nur mehrere Jahre die nothigen Correctionselemente geben, um aus der

Beobachtung einzelnerStundendie monatlichen Mittel der drei oben erwahnten

Grossen (Temperatur, Druck, Feuchtigkeit) zu berechnen. Ich glaube dass bei

dem jetzigen Standpunkt der Wissenschaft zweijahrige stiindliche Beobach-
tungen schon ein sehr werthvolles Material liefern, und dass funfjahrige den

Anforderungen wohl voUstandig geniigen.

   Was die Veranderungen in der jiihrlichen Periode betrifft, so haben die
dreimonatlichen Abschnitte, welche man in der Regel meteorologische Jahres-

zeiten nennt, nur f iir gewisse geographische Breiten diese Bedeutung, wiihrend
sie fiir andre Breiten heterogenes verbinden und zusammengehoriges ausein-

ander reissen. Ich halte es daher fiir nothwendig uberall bis auf monatliche

Mittel zuriickzugehen. Da aber mit der Verkiirzung des Zeitraumes seine

Veranderlichkeit wachst, so wird eine langer fortgesetzte Beobachtungsreihe

hier erst sichre Eleraente geben. Da aber ein System stiindlicher Beobach-

tungen nicht so lange fortgesetzt werden kann, so werden an die Stelle der-
selben Beobachtungen einzelner Stunden treten miissen. Welche sind zu
wahlen?

    Will man die Gesetze der taglichen Veranderungen hierbei noch im Auge
behalten, so wird die Wahl gleichweit von einander abstehender Stunden
wiinschenswerth seyn, weil empirische Formeln, die ihren Gang darstellen
sollen, am bequemsten aus diesen berechnet werden konnen. Wie aber
auch diese gewahlt werden mogen, immer werden einige in die Nacht also
unbequem fallen. So wie aber die Nachtbeobachtungen wegfallen verliert
man den Vortheil der Theilung der taglichen Periode in gleiche Abschnitte.

    Die Stunden 6, 9, 12, 3, 6, 9, oder 9, 12, 3, 9, sind mit Rucksicht auf die
barometrischen Oscillationen gewahlt, sie sind fiir die Berechnung der mit-

--tleren Temperatur --- ebenfalls bequem. Was aber die RUcksicht auf das

Barometer betrifft, so halte ich es fiir erwiesen, dass man es hier mit der
Differenz zweier Veranderungen zu thun hat, und dass es daher grdsseres
Interesse hat, die taglichen Extreme der Veranderungen des Druckes der
trocknen Luft und der Elasticitat der ihr beigemengten Wasserdampfe ge-
nondert zu kennen. Da aber die Stunden 3, 9, 3, 9, in dem Report of the
Committee of Physics, including meteorology, empfohlen sind, so halte ich es
fiir gut sie beizubehalten. Nach meiner Ansicht namlich ist es vorzuziehen,

einen einmal gefassten Beobachtungsplan consequent fortzufuhren, als ihn zu

verandern, selbst wenn sich spater herausstellen sollte, dass fur gewisse Zwecke

andre Stunden vorzuziehen gewesen waren. Denn die Hauptsache bei der

Beantwortung einer meteorologischen Frage bleibt iramer, iiber eine mog-

lichst lange Reihe gleichartiger Beobachtungen disponiren zu konnen.

Meine Antwort auf die Frage 3, "would you be disposed to recommend any

modification, extension or alteration in the system of observing or in the ap-

paratus to be employed," wiirde also verneinend seyn.

   Ad I. " What important objects are to be accomplished by the continuance

of the existing estabUshments for a longer period," erlaube ich mir folgende

Bemerkungen

Wir besitzen von keinem Punkte der siidlichen Halbkugel, von keinera

Punkte in Nordamerika eine barometrische, thermische oder atmische Wind-

rose, keine Berechnung der vom Drehungsgesetze des Windes abhangigen

Veranderungen des Barometer's, Thermometers und Hygrometers, die sich

auf eine hinlangliche Anzahl von Beobachtungen griindet. Ich wiirde es fiir

einen wesentlichen Dienst der Wissenschaft halten, wenn auch nur von einera

extratropischen Station der siidlichen Halbkugel und einer aus Nordamerika

eine 5- oder lO-jahrige Reihe dreimal taglich angestellter Beobachtungen des

Barometers, Thermometers, Hygrometers der Windesrichtung und des Re-

gens vorhanden ware, um den Einfluss des auf der siidlichen Erdhalfte entge-

gengesetzten Drehungsgesetzes und der Lage des Continentes gegen das Meer

scharf bestimmen zu konnen. Der Gang des Barometers in der jahrlichen

Periode, die Vertheilung der Regeumenge innerhalb derselben sind ebenfalls

wichtige Fragen, welche dadurch ihre Beantwortung erhalten wiirden. Frei-

lich miissten dazu mehrere Stationen mit einander verglichen werden.

Ich erlaube mir hier noch einige Fragen anzudeuten, welche wenn sie auch

nicht durch die bisherigen Stationen erledigt werden, dennoch ihrer Beant-

wortung naher riicken wiirden.

1. Die an der aiissern Grenze des N.E. Passats herabfallenden Winterregen

verwandeln sich in Siideuropa in ein Friihlings- und Herbstmaximum, welche

wahrend des Winters durch schwachere Niederschlage verbunden sind. An

den Alpen fallen diese beiden Maxima zusammen in ein Sommermaximum

von da nach Norden hin findet eine regenlose Zeit im Jahre nicht mehr statt,

indem iiberall im Innern des Continents bis nach Holland hin das Maximum

auf dem Sommer fallt. Finden ahnliche Verhaltnisse auf der Siidhalfte der

Erde statt?

2. Die Vertheilung des atmospharischen Druckes in der jahrlichen Periode

giebt wohl das sicherste Mittel darviber zu entsclieiden, ob ein in der Region

der Passate oder Monsoons liegender Ort meteorologisch zur Siidhalfte oder

WoNordhalfte der Erde gehbrt.   liegt diese Grenze und wie breit ist unter

verschiedenen Liingen die indilferente Zone, welche als diese Grenze anzu-

sehen ist ?

3. Die sogenannten unregelmassigen Veranderungen des Barometers

werden von einigen nur als Wirkungen verschieden temperirter und ungleich

feuchter Luftstrome angesehn, andere unterscheiden hingegen die Wirkung

der Strdme von der Wirkung nach Art der Tonwellen fortschreitender Un-

dulationen, welche sich iiber sehr grosse Theile der Erdfliiche mit erheblicher

Geschwindigkeit fortpflanzen. Aus der letzen Annahme scheint mir zufolgen

a. dass sie sich nicht einseitig nach einer Richtung fortpflanzen werden,

sondern peripherisch.

b. dass sie aus der gemassigten Zone auch in die heisse dringen miissen.

c. dass sic zu luterferenzerscheinungen Veranlassung geben werden.

Die Beobachtungen an einzelnen Tagen (stiindlich) konnen daruber ent-

scheiden welche Ansicht die richtige.
      ON MAGNKTICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 27

   4. Nachdem durch Untersuchungen uber die nichtperiodischen Verande-

rungen der Temperaturvertheilung auf der Oberflache der Erde, sich heraus-
gestellt hat, dass keine ungewohnliche Kalte irgendwo hervortritt ohne eiu

entgegengesetztes Extrem eirier ungewohnlichen Warme als Compensation

neben sich zu haben fragt sich
       a. ob diese Gegensatze stets auf einer Erdhalfte sich finden
       h. oder ob auch solche Gegensatze zwischen beiden Erdhalften statt-

finden ?

   5. Findet in der Gegend des Monsoons nach den avissern Grenzen hin
sine Zunahme des mittleren jahrlichen atmospharischen Druckes statt, wie

in der Passatzone ?

   6. 1st man berechtigt, bei der Vertheilung des mittleren atmospharischen
Druckes auf der Oberflache der Erde den Druck der troknen Luft zu sondern
von dem der Dampfatmosphare,wie es sich bei der Betrachtung der periodisch-

en Veranderungen als erfolgreich ergeben hat?

   Die Frage II. Do you consider that private research has to any successful

and valuable degree been estimated by the example of the government esta-
blishment in Europe and elsewhere, and that science has thereby received
material contributions, which would probably not otherwise have arisen, and
can you state instances ? glaube ich mit Ja beantworten zu konnen.

   Die Wirkung grossartiger wissenschaftlicher Unternehmungen ist eine
nachhaltige, nicht auf die Gegenwart beschrankte. Was ware die Meteoro-
logie ohne die Mannheimer Societat, welche es zuerst moglich machte, atmo-
spharische Erscheinungen mit verglichenen Instrumenten durch gleichzeitige
Beobachtungen einer schiirfern Prufung zu unterwerfen. Welche wichtigen
wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten sind auf diese Collectanen gegriindet worden.
Aber diese Arbeiten datiren alle aus einer viel spatern Zeit als die ihrer
Wirksamkeit. Daher wiirde es nicht auffallend seyn, wenn die j etzt wahrnehm-
bare Folgen des jetzigen Unternehmens noch unerheblich Avaren. Doch ist
diess nicht. Die Feststellung dass die aus der Gegend des Monsoons friiher
bekannte periodische Veranderung des atmospharischen Druckes im Verlauf
des Jahres sich auf ganz Centralasien erstrecke (wie ich ausf iihrlich in Pogg.
Annal. 58, p. 176, gezeigt habe) und die vollstandige Sonderung des continen-
talen Klima vom Seeklima ist eine Entdeckurig, welche wir den russischen Ob-
servatorien verdanken ebenso wie die Moglichkeit in der heissen Zone die tag-
lichen Aenderungen des Barometers in die constituirenden Elemente (Dampfund
trockne Luft) zu zerlegen, nur den englischen Observatorien zu verdanken ist.
Das wichtlge Resultat der allgemeinen Verbreitung eines geringen atmospha-
rischen Druckes vom Cap Horn bis in die siidarktischen Gegenden ist endlich
das dritte erhebliche meteorologisclie Resultat, welches ohne die Siidpolarex-
pedition noch lange unbekanntgeblieben ware. Rechnet man dazu, wie viel-
versprechend das System gleichzeitiger Beobachtungen ist, welches Hr.Lamont
gegriindet hat, wie in den von Hrn. Herschel und Quetelet gesamraelten und
veranlassten stUndlichen Beobachtungen Data vorhanden sind, einzelne
auffallende Phaenomene in erwiinschten Detail zu controlliren, so glaube ich
wohl kaum noch hinzufiigen zu diirfen, dass jeder, welcher seine Thatigkeit
vorzugsweise der Meteorologie zugewendet hat, nun im Stande sich fiihlt,
Probleme von Neuem aufzunehmen, deren Losung er einer viel spatern Zeit

vorbehalten glaubte.

  Meine schliessliche Ueberzeugung ist daher, dass vorzugsweise durch langere
Fortsetzung der systematischen Beobachtungen der Wissenschaft die erhe-
blichste Dienst geleistet werden wird.

                                                                           H. W. Dove.

    Vorstehende Bemerkungen, so unbedeutend sie sind, stelle ich ganz zur

dass ich sie deutsch geschrieben habe, um meine Ansicht mit der Bestimmt-

heit auszudiiicken, wie sie jedem in seiner Muttersprache gegeben ist.

                                                                                                   Berlin, 1st March 1845.

 --Dear Sir, I have answered the questions proposed to me by Sir John

Herschel in German, because every one can express himself with greater pre-

cision in his native language than in any other. I hope my letter will arrive

in sufficient time, although all our railways have been for some days buried

in snow, and are not yet opened even by the exertions of the military. I re-

turn you my hearty thanks for the to me exceedingly interesting paper,
' Meteorology of Toronto,' in which you have so kindly referred to my works.

Prav also give Mr. Riddell my very friendly thanks for ' Magnetical Instruc-
tion's.' I am sorry I have nothing to send in return, as the fourth part of my

' Non-periodic Variations in the Distribution of Temperature on the Surface

of the Earth between 1729 and 184<3,' will only appear in the course of the

summer.
   From Sir John Herschel's letter, I perceive that a volume of ' Extraordinary

Magnetic Disturbances at the British Government Stations,' and the first

volume of the ' Greenwich Observations,' have been sent to me, and that I

am to receive the first volume of the ' Observations at the British Government

Stations,' and the second volume of the ' Greenwich Observations.' Unfor-

tunately I have received only the 'Magnetic Disturbances,' for which I

return my cordial thanks. Should it be wished that I should take part in the
calculations of the meteorological observations, I place my activity entirely

at the disposal of the Committee.

In the study of the non-periodic variations, I have often had occasion to

regret that the journals of observations published in England were not acces-

sible to me. Would it not be possible that some one should undertake, at
the request of the British Association, a Climatology of England, in which

the monthly means of the several years at the different observation stations

should be printed, for which my work is even already a preparatory work ?

Would it not further be very advantageous if the meteorological journals

which are printed to accompany the Transactions of Learned Societies and

Philosophical Journals had more copies taken off, that they might afterwards
be bound up in complete and independent years ? What an infinity of time
would be saved if one was no longer forced to look for every single month

in a different volume, which, if it happens to be lent away from a public
Alibrary, often interrupts a work for months !
                                                proposition emanating from

the British Association would soon be imitated in other countries as well, and

we should then be enabled to advance science more quickly.

I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration,

                                   Your very obedient servant,

                                                (Signed) H. W. Dove.

   The problem to be solved by meteorological observations is a threefold
one : they are to give mean values, empirical laws for the periodic variations
of these values, and finally, to furnish data for tracing the simultaneous ex-
tension and the progressive march of a meteorological phaenomenon over the

surface of the earth.

   As the mean quantities can only be obtained after the elimination of pe-
riodical variations, the determination of the latter is directly demanded for
both these objects, and hourly observations of temperature, pressure, and hu-
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 29

inidity are indispensable for this purpose. As the range of the diurnal
variations is mucli less in clouded than in clear weather, and the diurnal
march of the barometer is even diflPerent in the two cases, more years than
one appear to be indispensable for the establishment of their laws ; more years

than one are also required to give the necessary elements of coi-rection for
calculating the monthly means of temperature, pressure, and humidity, from
the observations at the several hours. I believe that in the present state of
science, even two years of hourly observation will give us very valuable ma-
terials, and that five years will completely satisfy what is required in this
respect. In regard to variations within the annual period, the three monthly
sections ordinarily employed as meteorological seasons, are only truly such
for certain latitudes ; in other latitudes they combine heterogeneous data and
dissever corresponding ones ; I therefore hold it better to return everywhere
to monthly means ; but as the shortening of the intervals increases their va-
riability, a longer continued series becomes necessary to give assured ele-
ments. As however the system of hourly observations cannot be continued
so long, certain hours must be selected ; which are they to be ?

    If it is desired to keep the laws of the diurnal variations still in view, hours
at equal intervals will be desirable for the convenience of empirical formulae ;
but this would necessitate the inconvenience of night observation ; and if this
is avoided, the advantage of equal intervals must be given up.

   The hours of 6, 9, 12, 3, 6, 9, or 9, 12, 3, 9, have been chosen with a view

to the barometric oscillations ; they are also convenient for the calculation of

the mean temperature. But as respects the barometer, I regard it as proved
that we have here to do with the difference of two variations, and that it is

therefore of greater interest to learn separately the daily extremes of the va-
riations of the pressure of the dry air and of the elasticity of the aqueous

vapour mingled therein. As however the hours 3, 9, 3, 9 have been recom-
mended in the ' Report of the Committee of Physics,' I hold it good to keep

to them, thinking it better to continue consistently a system of observation
once begun than to alter it, even though it be afterwards shown that other

hours are preferable for certain objects : the command of as long a series as

possible of precisely similar observations is always that which is chiefly to be

desired for the solution of a meteorological question.

   To question 3, " Would you be disposed to recommend any modification,"

&c. &c., my answer would therefore be negative.
   To question 1, "What important objects are to be accomplished by the

--continuance of the existing establishments for a longer period," I permit my-

self the following remarks:

  We possess from no point of the southern hemisphere, and from no point

in North America, a barometric, thermic, or atmic windrose, no calculation
of the variations of the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, dependent
on the law of rotation of the wind, founded on a sufficient number of obser-
vations. I should regard it as an essential service to science, if from only one
extra-tropical station in the southern hemisphere, and from one in North
America, we had a five or ten years series of observations three times a day
of the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, direction of the wind, and
quantity of rain ; to enable us to determine the question of the opposite law
of rotation in the southern hemisphere, and the influence of the relative po-
sition of continent and sea. The annual march of the barometer and annual
distribution of the quantity of rain are also important questions which would
thus be answered. It would however require the intercomparison of different

stations.

   I will now permit myself to allude to some questions, which if not solved
     ----

--30 REPORT 1845.

by the stations hitherto established, will be at least brought nearer to a

solution.

   1. The winter rain which falls at the extei'nal limit of the N.E. trade, is
changed in southern Europe to a spring and autumn maximum, connected
by a less precipitation in winter ; these two maxima, when we come to the
Alps, join themselves to form a summer maximum, and from thence north-
wards we find no season free from rain ; everywhere on the interior of the
continent and as far as Holland the maximum is in summer. Does the
southern hemisphere show similar relations ?

   2. The annual distribution of the atmospheric pressure gives the most cer-
tain means of deciding whether a station within the region of trades or of
monsoons belongs meteorologically to the northern or to the southern half of
the globe. Where lies this limit, and how broad under different meridians is
the indifferent zone, which is to be regarded as this limit ?

   3. The so-called irregular variations of the barometer are regarded by some
persons as only the effects of currents of air of unequal temperature and
moisture ; other persons distinguish the effect of currents from the effect of
undulations progressing in the manner of waves of sound, and propagating

themselves with great velocity over large portions of the earth's surface.

   From the latter hypothesis the consequences appear to me to be,

       a. That they will not propagate themselves towards one side, but peri-

              pherically.

       b. That they must penetrate from the temperate into the torrid zone also.
       c. That they will give rise to phsenomena of interference.
Hourly observations on single days are capable of showing which view is

correct.

    4. Investigations on the non-periodic variations of the distribution of tem-
perature on the surface of the earth having shown that no unusual cold takes
place anywhere without an unusual warmth by its side as a compensation,

we ask,
       a. Whether these oppositions are always in the same hemisphere ?
       b. Or whether similar oppositions exist also between the two hemispheres?

    5. Is there towards the outer limits of the monsoons an increase of the
mean annual atmospheric pressure as in the trade zones ?

    6. Are we justified, in regard to the distribution of the mean atmospheric
pressure on the surface of the earth, in distinguishing the pressure of the dry
 air from that of the atmosphere of vapour in the manner which in the consi-
deration of the periodical variations has shown itself fruitful in consequences?

   To question 2, " Do you consider that private research has," &c., 1 think I

--may answer, The effect of great scientific undertakings is an enduring one,

not limited to the present. What would meteorology have been without the
Manheim Society, which first made it possible to subject to a closer exami-
nation simultaneous observations made with compared instruments? What

important scientific works are founded on these collections I yet these works

all belong to a period much later than that of the activity of the system of
the Manheim Society. It would not therefore be surprising if we could not

yet see any important consequences from the present undertaking. It is not so
however: the fact that the previously-known periodic annual variation of the
atmospheric pressure in the region of the monsoons extends from thence to the
 whole of central Asia (as I have shown in detail in Pogg. Annal, 58, p. 176),
 and the complete distinction of the continental from the sea cUmate, are a
discovery for which we have to thank the Russian observatories. The possi-
 bility within the torrid zone of resolving the diurnal variations of the baro-
 meter into their coexistent elements (vapour and dry air) is due to the
ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 31

AEnglish observatories.         third important meteorological result, which would

have remained long unknown to us without the Antarctic Expedition, is the

general extension of a lo<v atmospheric pressure from Cape Horn to the An-

tarctic regions. If we include also the much-promising system of simultaneous

observation founded by Laraont, and the data which, in the hourly obser-

vations called for and collected by Herschel and Quetelet, exist for con-

trolling with the desired detail single striking phaenomena, I believe that I

need hardly add^ that every one who has devoted his activity to meteorology

now feels himself in the case to take up afresh problems of which he formerly

believed the solution to be reserved for a much later period.

In conclusion, my conviction is that by longer continuance, especially of

the systematic observations, the greatest service will be rendered to science.

    1 place entirely at the disposal of the Committee the foregoing remarks,

inconsiderable as they are, and I ask them to excuse my having written them
in German, in order to express my views with that definiteness which it is

given to every one to do in his mother tongue.

--MoN CHER Monsieur, Je me hate d'accuser reception de votre lettre du

6 Decembre dernier, qui ne m'est parvenue que depuis trois jours, avec le pre-

mier volume des ' Observations de Toronto.' Je regrette vivement que le

retard qu'a eprouve votre lettre, et le pen de jours qui nous separent du 10

Mars, ne me perraetttont que de repondre partiellement aux questions que

vous m'avez fait I'honneur de m'adresser.

1°. En ce qui concernela premiere demande,il meseraitbien difficile dejuger

des a present de tous les avantages que la science pourrait retirer de la con-

tinuation du systeme des observations magnetiques actuellement existant, je

n'ai pas encore ete a meme d'etablir des comparaisons entre les observations

de I'Europe et celles des autres parties du globe, et de juger si les resultats

qu'on etait en droit d'attendre de I'Association si heureusement constituee,

sont suffisamment realises, pour qu'on puisse renoncer desormais a en recueil-

lir encore.

II est un point cependant dont je me suis occup6, et sur lequel je me per-

mettrai  d'attirer I'attention  du  comite                            je  veux  parler  du                                                    systeme   des  ob-

servations meteorologiques. Malgre les efforts perseverants de quelques

savants, parmi lesquels il faut surtout ranger votre digne President, nos con-

naissances sur le mouvement des ondes atmospheriques sont encore bien

bornees. Nous ne savons a-peu-pres rien sur les lieux ou ces ondes se for-

ment, sur la maniere dont elles se propagent, sur les directions qu'elles suivent

plus particulierement, sur leur vitesse de translation, sur les modifications que

leur font subir la forme et la nature des asperites du globe ainsi que les vents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

en un mot, nous sommes dans I'impossibiiite de construire une carte qui lie

entr'eux les  mouvements propages   a  travers                            I'atniosphere                                                       nous  ne  savons

pas meme si une pareille carte est possible. Pour expliquer ma pensee, je

suppose qu'on represente au moyen de lignes, les oscillations atmospheriques,

accusees par le barometre,*n faisant usage des observations qui s'executent de

deux en deux heures, a Greenwich, Dublin, Edimbourg, Bruxelles, Munich,

Prague, St. Petersbourg, et les autres vilies qui ont adopte le systeme d'ob-

servation propose par la Societe Royale, on se trouvera dans I'impossibiiite

de lier entre elles les diverses oscillations par la loi de continuite. Entre

puisse reconnaitre les ondulations qui sont dues aux memes causes. Les

Tautre ville; ct rien sur le passage ne constate ces modifications. On pour-

rait suppleer, en prenant des stations intermediares, ou Ton observerait ne

fut ce qu'une fois par jour pour etablir la continuite, car les sommets consecu-
tifs de deux ondes atmospheriques sontsepares en general par plusieurs jours
d'intervalle ; or, ce systeme secondaire qui rattacherait ensemble les points

du reseau principal, n'existe pas meme pour I'Europe ; et par suite il est a

craindre que nous ne puissions tirer des observations actuelles, que des bien
faibles secours pour resoudre la question qui nous occupe.

   Des observations isolees sur les variations de pressions atmospheriques de
temperature, etc. pourront toujours se faire a une epoque quelconque; niais
il n'existera peut-etre plus jamais une occasion aussi favorable pour embrasser
dans leur generalite plusieurs importantes questions de la physique du globe,
et particulierement I'interessant probleme de la formation et de la transmission

des ondes atmospheriques.
   Je pense done que, dans le cas ou I'existence de I'association serait pro-

longee, le comite rendrait le service le plus important, si autour des grands
points du reseau meteorologique qu'on est parvenu a former, elle etablissait,
dans les localites qui le permettraient et notamment dans toute I'Europe, un
reseau secondaire de points separes par des intervalles de 60 a 80 lieues seule-
raent, et ou Ton se bornei'ait a observer ne fut ce qu'une seule fois par jour a
une heure determinee. Ces observations suffiraient pour etablir la continuite
entre les observations des stations principales, et pour leur donner une con-
nection d'utilite que malheureusement elles n'ont pas a present. Assez d'ob-

servateurs zeles repondraient sans doute a I'appel qui leur serait fait.

   2°. Vous avez bien voulu me demander encore si je pense que I'exemple

du gouvernement Britannique a pu faire naitre des recherches particulieres, et
provoquer des travaux qui n'auraient pas ete faits autrement? Votre ques-
tion m'autorise a citer ce qui s'est passe en Belgique ; ce n'est qu'en m'appu-
yant sur I'invitation que la Societe Royale m'avait fait I'honneur de m'adresser,
que j'ai obtenu du gouvernement, les aides et les moyens necessaires pour
entreprendre une serie d'observations qui manquaient completement pour
notre royaume. Nous ne connaissions absolument rien sur les variations
diurnes et annuelles qui subissent, chez nous, les elemens magnetiques du
globe. Pour la meteorologie, nous avons pu recueillir egalement un ensem-
ble d'observations qui ne sont pas sans importance pour la connaissance de
notre climat. L'appel qui nous a ete fait, a done eu d'heureux resultats pour

la science, en dehors meme de son objet special ; car j'ignore encore si ces

penibles travaux repondront au but que le comite s'etait propose en les de-

 --Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the Toronto Magnetic Observa-

tions, accompanied by the inquiries for the information of the Committee
appointed in that system of observation. I herewith transmit the replies to

these inquiries by Mr. Broun my first assistant, who has evinced the utmost

zeal and attention throughout, and he has been steadily supported by the
others. Should the government decide on continuing the magnetic and me-
teorological observations, I shall feel equally disposed to extend those made
here, but on this point I shall decide hereafter. I hope shortly to furnish a
copy of an abstract made by Professor Forbes, of the paper read to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh on these observations ; the abstract is short, but shows
what has been done. It is now in types, and as soon as I receive it, a copy
shall be sent.

                            I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,

From J. A. Broun, Esq., First Assistant in the Magnetical and Meteorohgi-

                                      cal Observatory at Makerstoun.

(^Extracts)

Query I. "Whether in your judgement there are any, &uA'\i so,tohat

important objects to be accomplished by a continuance of the existing esta-

blishments for a longer period, executing as at present both systematic and

simultaneous observations, or either class to the exclusion of the others."

The declination, the easiest ascertained of all the magnetic elements, be-

cause unconnected with the varying magnetic moment of the needle, is still

mixed up with many errors which we are only discovering. This reniark

holds much more strongly for the components of intensity. The imperfections
of our instruments and methods are only beginning to be ascertained. What
shall we say of magnetic disturbances ? Have we found out the laws which

connect these wonderful irregularities ? Have we ascertained their connexion

with other terrestrial phsenomena, aurora for example ?

I am afraid that to these and many other questions of a like nature, the

Aanswer would be unsatisfactory.  sifting investigation of the observations

already made may do much. Dr. Lament's deductions of the law which seems

to connect the excursions of the declination needle at different places during

disturbances, while they show what may be done, likewise show how much

there is to do.

   But are accurate and complete results to be obtained by the allotment ot
any short period for their determination? No. It is only gradually that we
discover erroi-, gradually remove it ; time alone can show us what we ought

and we need not observe.
   I am inclined to believe that it is from a thorough and careful investigation

of magnetic disturbances and their collateral phaenomena, that we shall first
arrive at a solution of the great questions of terrestrial magnetism. To observe
disturbances well requires a continuous watch upon the magnetical instru-
ments, and no watch is better than that which hourly or two-hourly observa-

tions impose, besides their utility in determining the regular variations.

   It has long been my opinion that regular term observations are, at least at

present, unnecessary. There is little doubt that magnetic disturbances occur
for the most part simultaneously over the whole world ; what use then of pre-
arranged periods of observations, when the earth itself telegraphs the time,
and the magnets point to the zealous observer, when he should and when he

need not observe ?

   I have spoken chiefly of magnetism, but my remarks will apply equally to
meteorology ; with it also much has to be done. The work of a few well-

placed observatories in a few years will do more for science than all the
scattered observations made loosely and irregularly for the last century.

    One great use of these observatories should be to co-ordinate the scattered
observadons made by travellers or others around them ; for this purpose there
should be some provision for publishing these along with the observations of
the observatory, especially when the instruments have been compared and are

trustworthy.

   To the second query I cannot give any general answer. It may not be

amiss, however, to mention this, the Makerstoun Observatory, as a consequence
of the foundation of the government observatories, nor to state that hourly
magnetical and meteorological observations have been made here throughout
1844, and are being continued in 1845, while a large mass of extra observa-

tions have been obtained.
    Query 3. " In case of the continuance of the observatories beyond 1845,
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAIi OBSERVATIONS. 35

would you be disposed to recommend any, and what modifications, extensions
or alterations in the system of observing, or in the apparatus employed ?"

   Under Query 1, I have pointed out the preference which I would give to
extra observations of disturbances, and have recommended the discontinuance
at present of term observations.

   I am inclined to prefer hourly observations to two-hourly, as the first com-

pared with the second does not add so greatly to the labour of the observer
or the computer as might at first appear, at least when the whole work of the
observatory is taken into account.

                             IX. Dr. Lloyd to Sir John Herschel.

                                                                            Trinity College, Dublin, March 8, 1845.

  --Dear Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, on the part of

the Magnetic Committee of the British Association, and to reply to its several

queries as far as I am able.
   The first question, viz. " Whether there are any, and if so, what important

objects to be accomplished by a continuance of the existing establishments

--for a longer period," necessarily suggests the inquiry, how far the objects

originally proposed have been attained, or are likely to be attained, by the
course of observation now in progress, and terminating with the present year ?

We may afterwards inquire, whether there are any new objects suggested by

the results themselves, or otherwise.

    In reference to the first inquiry, it will be convenient to keep in mind the
distinctions of magnetic determinations into those of the absolute values of the
direction and intensity of the magnetic force at particular epochs, and those
of the changes which they are continually undergoing ; and again, the sub-
division of the latter mio periodic variations, secular changes, and disturbances.
Of these, the diurnal variations are those whose determination demands the
 greatest amount of labour, and they are fortunately also those which seem
now to be best determined. I am of opinion that five years of uninterrupted
 hourly or two-hourly observation is fully adequate to the establishment of
 their empirical laws, with all the requisite precision ; and this opinion is con-
 firmed by the examination of the results of two years at the Toronto obser-

 vatory, I'ecently published.

    The knowledge of the annual variations of the magnetic elements, and that
 of their secular changes, can be obtained with precision only by means of
 absolute determinations, often repeated at particular epochs, and reduced to
 their mean values by the help of the differential instruments. The instru-
 mental means which we at present possess are probably sufficient to furnish

 the data required in both parts of this delicate deduction with all tiie neces-

 sary exactness ; but the difficulty seems to lie in the irregular fluctuations of
 the elements themselves, or in other words, in the want of regularity in the

 annual period, and in the progression of the secular change. To eliminate

 completely the effects of these irregularities, a longer course of observation
 is probably necessary; but in carrying it on it is by no means requisite that
 the daily observations should be as numerous as heretofore.

     Enough has probably been done to ascertain the more obvious phaenomena
 of disturbances, and perhaps also to furnish the jjrincipal data for theory.
 But it is not improbable that the application of theory may suggest or demand
 additional data respecting them, and other methods of combined observation.

     With respect to the meteorological results, it is probable that the diurnal
 and annual }ieriods of the pressure, temperature and moisture, will have been
 taffiiciently determined by the course of observation now in progress ; and in

                                                                  d2
  --

--36 REPORT 1845.

any case, should further data be required, they may be furnished by self-
registering uppuratiis. It would, however, be desirable to ascertain, at more
than one latitude, the influence of height upon the temperature and moisture,
 by the means devised by Prof. VVheatstone, and about to be employed at
Woolwich. To this we may add, as a desideratum, the determination of the

 laws of the electrical changes, taken in connexion with other meteorological

phaenomena. The observatory of the Association at Kew, and that of Green-
 wich, are the only stations which have furnished such results.

    On the whole, I cannot but consider the continuance of the observatories

 for a longer period, if not jjermanently, to be important to the branches of
science which they were intended to elucidate, although I believe that their

number may be somewhat diminished, and that the amount of systematic
work (and therefore also the observing staff) may, without detriment, be re-

duced at all.

   In reply to the second query, I am not able to state any instance in which

the establishment of the combined system of observation has elicited privae
research, with the exception of the signal one of the Brisbane observatory.
The very magnitude of the plan itself is a sufficient reason for this. It is
however no inconsiderable boon to science that it has enlisted in her cause
many zealous young men, willing and able to promote it, and whose talents
probably might not otherwise have received this direction. It may be added,
that private research may naturally be expected in the theoretical discussion
of the experimental data.

    The answer to the third query is connected with that already given to the
first. Assuming that the general features of the diurnal changes are suffi-
ciently determined, I Avould recommend the discontinuance of the daily ob-
servations, except at those hours in which the magnetic elements are in their
most stable state, whether as respects the influence of the periodic changes, or
of disturbances. Both these conditions are satisfied for Europe and America
at the hour of the maximum of westerly declination, and that of the principal
minimum of the horizontal force.

    I would recommend that more time be allotted to absolute and occasional
observations, and in particular, that the absolute determination of the decli-
nation should be made from time to time, like those of the other two elements,
with a separate instrument.

    I would suggest that simultaneous observations at short intervals should be

made on one day in each week during the year 1846. The objects which may

be expected to be attained by such an extension of this class of observations,
are

   1. To furnish a record of a sufficient number of disturbances without the

         help of occasional observations.

   2. To supply a number of undisturbed series, sufficient to determine the
       diurnal curves for summer and winter from observations at short intervals.

   3. To afford the means of separating from one another the two classes of

        changes.

   4. To supply the simultaneous observations which are required in absolute
       and occasional determinations.

   It would probably in most cases be possible to obtain the occasional as-
sistance necessary for such observations, without keeping up the whole of the
present observing staff.

   With respect to magnetic instruments, I am not disposed to recommend any

considerable alteration in the declinometer and Bifilar Magnetometer already
in use. Most of the improvements suggested by experience have been added
from time to time ; and the advantage of strict comparability in method seems
                                             --

      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 37

to outweigh any which might be derived from more perfect instrumental
forms. Neither should I recommend the discontinuance of the Balance
Magnetometer where (as at Toronto) it has given good results. I would how-
ever propose to add the Induction Inclinometer as an additional means of de-
termining the variations of the third element, if in any case it has not been
already furnished ; and for the observation of the absolute declination and
absolute intensity, I have suggested a form of instrument (the Theodolite
Magnetometer') which appears to combine exactness with facility of manipu-
lation. Of the two latter instruments I send printed descriptions. To these
I would propose to add a self-registering apparatus for recording the disturb-
ances of the declination, which should reach a certain limit, constructed on
Professor Wheatstone's fertile principle of employing the force of a closed
electrical circuit; and it would be easy to contrive it so as to distinguish
positive and negative deflections on the record.

    In Meteorology, self-registering instruments (on Prof. Wheatstone's prin-
ciple, or some other) will probably soon supersede all other means of obser-
ving. It will of course be desirable that each observatory which is to remain
in operation should be furnished with such instruments as soon as their most
convenient form shall have been determined. If to these be added an appa-
ratus for the observation of atmospheric electricity, on the principle of that at
Kew, the equipment would probably be adequate to the present demands of
meteorological science.

   I fear I have been somewhat prolix, and have only to add, that you are of
course at liberty to make use of the foregoing suggestions in any manner you
may think expedient.

                          Believe me to be, dear Sir, yours very faithfully,
                                                                                          H. Lloyd.

                     X. John Phillips, Esq., to Lieut.' Col. Sabine.

                                                               1 Islington Terrace, Kingstown, March 8, 1845.

 --Dear Sir, 1. The objects to be sought for in observations of magnetical

and meteorological phaenomena appear to be the following :
    a. Observations coincident with the local occurrences of unusual or unex-
       plained phaenomena, such as meteors, rotatory storms, remarkable hail-
        storms, &c.
    )8. Observations to detect the laws of extensive disturbances in magnetical
       and meteorological elements, for in all such cases laws must be presumed
      to exist, and may probably be detected and determined,
    y. Observations to determine precisely the laws oi general periodical oscil-
      lation and progression, whose ordinary aspect is known or supposed, such
       as daily oscillation, annual oscillation, and secular variation.

   In reference to all these points,\t appears to me that the observatories already

established should be continued. There can be no question that these objects
are worthy of continued effort ; that they are not yet fully attained, but are
in progress of being attained by the steady employment of the present ob-
servation-power ; and that to cease this effort when the laws of phaenomena
are only just beginning to appear, would be quite unworthy of the scientific
spirit which dictated this great combination.

   2. I am not aware that the establishment of the magnetical and meteoro-

logical observatories has yet had any great effect in stimulating private experi-
mental research. This may be in part attributed to the very slight degree in
which the peculiar character of these establishments has become known to
the public by their published fruits. It appears to me, however, that it is
                                 --

38 REPORT--1845.

rather as consequent on the published results of the observatories, than as

coincident with their labours, that we may expect to see private exertion

stimulated and directed, and science advanced by these means. Individual
efforts may be useful at the beginning to indicate, and finally to complete the

application of great natural laws, but in such branches of knowledge as mag-

netism, the great body of facts must embrace areas of surface, duration of

time, and frequency of observation, which remove all but special problems
from the domain of private exertion. Nor can these special problems be

properly defined or prosecuted by good methods until the more general re-
sults to which they are supplementary are further advanced.

   If indeed self-registering instruments can be found for magnetism, it may
become popular, as meteorology undoubtedly is popular, however little ad-
vanced by the circumstance.

3. In respect of maguetical phaenomena, the systematic, simultaneous and

extraordinary observations appear to include all that is essential. To the
meteorological registration something may be added.

   To complete the data for studying the relations of heat and moisture, it is

desirable to have observations of the thermometer and wet-bulb hygrometer
at more than one height above the ground. If at three or four levels, say
3, 6, 12, 24 feet above the surface, these instruments were frequently ob-

served, information would be gained concerning the distribution of heat and

moisture, in the part of the atmosphere where these conditions are the most
variable, which could not fail to be important.

There would probably be little difficulty in adding to the observations a

register of long thermometers, sunk 3, 6, 12, and 24 feet below the surface, so
as to extend the basis of the laws of distribution of daily and annual heats at
small depths, which have been developed by Quetelet and Forbes.

   The rate of evaporation of water appears worthy of record, in connection

with so complete a system of two-hourly (better hourly) temperature and

hygrometry, especially as this observation may be found hereafter a valuable
check upon the mechanical indications of the anemometers, which taken alone

are liable to some objection.

To Col. Sabine, R.A., Woolwich.  Very truly yours.

 --Gentlemen, I had the pleasure, a few days since, of receiving the volume

entitled ' Observations at the Toronto Observatory, 1840 to 1842,' and take

the earliest opportunity of expressing my thanks to the British Government,

through your kind intervention, for this most important present. Magnetical
and meteorological observations made so uninterruptedly, and with such per-
fect regard of ail important circumstances as those contained in this volume,
are of immeasurable value for the physical knowledge of our globe. The
true object of meteorology appears more and more to be twofold, viz.

   1. The representation of the periodical changes of every phaenomenon by
function of sines ; and

   2. The representation of the mean values of the various phaenomena by the

V functions of Laplace, which must be applied to the values of atmospheric

pressure, temperature, &c. observed in different points of the globe, as they
have been by Gauss to the phaenomena of terrestrial magnetism.

   Which part soever of these two we may employ ourselves with, it is always
                                                                                  '

ON MAGNETICAIi AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 39

most welcome, and indeed indispensable, to be possessed of such a stock of
exact facts relating to several parts of the earth as have been furnished by

the English magnetical and meteorological observatories. In the first place,

as regards the laws of periodical changes, the probable error of each particular

observation has been exceedingly reduced by the exemplary and successful

care your observers bestowed on the examination of the instruments employed.

If therefore the phsenomena under investigation were strictly periodical,! am

inclined to think that a set of five years' observations would suffice for deter-
mining exactly the constants of the series that must represent them. But in

reality this is not the case. In almost every one of the phaenomena examined,
the particular values for a given day varied so much from the average peri-

odical range, and the discovery of the law of these variations relative to many

of these phEenomena is of so much importance, that the prolongation of the

activity of the Enghsh observatories beyond the period of five years is ren-
dered pai'ticularly desirable by this same circumstance. Let me quote only
one example of this fact, out of the great number that actually exist. The

English observations have first demonstrated that the instantaneous changes

of terrestrial magnetism do not take place at so strictly contemporaneous mo-

ments in America and in Europe as we were led to surmise by the European

observations only. The proofs of this important fact however have not been

obtained for every day of the period of observations, but only during the so-

called term days, in which the English operations corresponded with those of

the German Magnetic Association ( Verein). How desirable would it be,

notwithstanding, to discover on which of the stations a given perturbation

has first occurred, and in what degree and rate of proceeding it has extended

to the other points of observation ! It is only by this course that we may

hope to fathom the true law of these momentary variations of magnetic

power ; or, in other words, the real position of their active cause and the pro-

pagation of its effects. It will certainly be of material service to a future in-

quirer on this subject to be provided with simultaneous observations of all the

principal meteorological phaenomena ; but nevertheless it may be confidently

predicted that he will be highly gratified to be furnished with the results of a

longer series of observations than those given by a period of five years. Any

one who has been engaged in similar investigations will recollect the pleasure

he has often felt if, after having had a limited number of observations as the

basis of his work, he has been able to strengthen it by the addition of some

new ones. It seems to me, therefore, that the English Government will give

a new proof of the zeal so worthy of a free and happy nation which they have

displayed in the patronage and promotion of science, by granting a prolonga-

tion of their magnetical and meteorological observations, in exactly the same

irianner as they have been proceeding hitherto^ even after the expiration of the

Ayear 1845.  sufficient encouragement for the continuation of this institu-

tion is afforded indeed by the brilliant results already obtained, which would

immortalize it, even if its visible existence should be prematurely discontinued.

I allude particularly to the exactitude of the mean annual values obtained at

the different stations for every particular phsenomenon. Toronto, for instance,

affords in meteorological respects a highly interesting comparison with the

opposite (western) coast of America. In an article on the climate of Ross

in California, which I take the liberty of inclosing, I fixed the isothermal line of
=y°-267 R. the mean temperature at the level of the sea, in 38° 34' lat, 233° 41
Along, east of Paris.
                       further investigation proved that there is scarcely a

point on our globe where in an equal latitude the mean temperature is as low

as under this meridian, although in higher latitudes it is distinguished by re-
          --

latively high temperatures. I found on this occasion the isothermal points to
be as follows:

The pressure of the whole atmosphere at Toronto is therefore, as was to

be expected, superior to that of the Pacific and inferior to that of the Atlan-
tic in the same latitude. The pressure of vapour at this point, however, is

considerably less than under the same latitude in either of the two oceans.

This circumstance is explained, partly, by the hygrometrical observations
=giving the humidity of the air at Toronto 0"78, and on the ocean at 40°

= =lat.                        0*85 partly by the mean temperature

of the continent at Toronto having been found to be considerably lower than

under the same parallel at sea.
   You will pardon these superficial reflections, considering how difficult it is

to avoid the temptation of making & preliminary use of a treasure like the
Toronto observations, even when hoping to devote one's leisure to its further

study and development.

In conclusion, I avail myself of your kind permission to submit two pro-

posals relative to future magnetical and meteorological labours.

1. The determinations of mean magnetic values for the year 1829 have not

yet been completely applied to the deduction of the Gaussian constants of

terrestrial magnetism for the same year. A comparison of the magnetical

maps, representing the empirical results on the one hand and those calculated

by the Gaussian constants on the other, is still far from presenting a perfect

agreement. For the above year there is still wanting, therefore,

1 Those values of the constants which best correspond to the existing

observations ; and

2. The probable errors of each of those first bases of the theory.

This deficiency appears to me a material one as regards science. The

English and Russian observations combined will afford the most probable

values of these constants for the year 1845, and it is consequently most de-

sirable to learn, by a comparison with equally probable values of the same

for the year ] 829, their annual variation. Even should these values for 1 829

be somewhat less exact than the later ones, this circumstance is not of mate-

Nowrial importance, if the amount of their probable error is ascertained.

both these requisites, i\ie best possible determination of the constants for 1829

and the calculation of their probable error, can be effected in the following

manner :

1. By forming from each magnetic element observed in 1829 an equation

containing on the one hand a known numeric value (i. e, the difference

between the observed value of this element and the same calculated

theoretically with the assumed preliminary amounts of the constants),

and on the other certain given multiples of the corrections to be ap-

   plied singly to each of the 24 Gaussian constants ; and
2. By resolving, according to the method of least squares, the linear equa-

   tions with 24 unknown elements, obtained in this manner (amounting

in all to about 1000).                                                 i

By this means we shall obtain not only the most probable corrected values of

the above constants, but likewise the probable error of each of them.

   In Schumacher's Astronomical Notices (Astron. Nachrichten, Nos.450, 452
and 454), the commencement of this undertaking has been published as exe-

cuted at my request with exemplary zeal by a scientific young friend of mine.
At my own suggestion, however, the prosecution and conclusion of this work

has been deferred to a period when it might be performed without a ruinous

sacrifice of time and trouble on the part of the individual engaged in it. It
became evident indeed that a calculation of this extent A\ould necessitate an

entire devotion to the task of one or two years, for which the pecuniary assist-

ance of some government would be indispensable. If you should be of the
--42 REPORT 1845,

same opinion as I am concerning the importance of this undertaking, you
would confer an essential obligation on me by expressing your approval in a

manner that would give it a sufficient weight to induce some government to
grant the requisite means ; 40/. or 50/. a year, for the term of two years, would
suffice foi: a person residing in this country, and I could guarantee the com-
plete and satisfactory performance of the whole, if completed in the same
manner as it was begun. I leave it to the decision of the Committee of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science to recommend this work
to the attention of one of the two governments (the English and Russian)
that have already displayed their zeal for the advancement of the magnetic
science, or to some other, the Prussian for instance, that may wish to follow

so laudable an example. At all events, I am convinced that the recommen-

dation of a committee enjoying so deserved a reputation as yours would be
attended with the most complete success, a success so desirable for the ad-
vancement of science.

    The second desideratum that occurs to me, refers to the form of publica-
tion of meteorological observations at sea. Such observations having been
regularly made during the many scientific expeditions of later years, the
journals of these voyages would easily furnish us with the diurnal value of
the observed phsenoniena, accompanied by a section of the latitude, longitude
and date on each day of observation.

    The acquisition of similar tables, as afforded by the different voyages, is in

my opinion of the greatest possible value as regards all questions of scientific
meteorology. What imparts particular impoi'tance to the meteorological ob-

servations as made at sea is,
       1. The equal elevation of the instruments;
       2. The equal constitution of the surface on which the observations take

              place.

   As such tables would greatly facilitate the due combination of the observa-
tions, I consider them in fact as indispensable.

                                                   I am, Gentlemen,
                                                          Your most obedient servant,

  --Dear Sir, In answer to your letter of December 5th, 1844, 1 shall begin

by replying to your lust question, that I have no objection against your

making what use you please of this letter, were it not my consciousness of its

utter insignificancy. At all events, as I do not pretend to correctness in
writing in your idiom, I beg your leave to put down what little I may have to
say in German, the more so as yourself are perfectly master of the language
of your forefathers.

    So sehr ich mich geehrt f iihle, dass Sic auf mein Urtheil in Beziehung auf
das langere Fortbestehen der rait grossartiger Munificenz von der Britischen
Regierung in fremden Welttheilen errichteten magnetischen Anstalten einen
Werth zu legen scheinen, so leid thut es mir dass ich ausser Stande bin, auf
die mir vorgelegten bestimmten Fragen eben so bestimmte Antworten zu geben,
und zwar hauptsiichlich aus dem Grunde, weil mir die Resultate der bisher
in jenen Anstalten ausgefiihrten Arbeiten noch fast ganzlich unbekannt sind.
In der That sind mir zwar der erster Band der zu Greenwich gemachten mag-
netischen Beobachtungen und ein Band ausserordentliche magnetische Std-
rungen zu seiner Zeit richtig zugekommen, wofvir ich meinen ergebensten
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 43

Dank abstatte, allein der erste Band der Beobachtungen auf den aussereuro-
paischen britischen Stationen, dessen Empfang Ihr gutiges Schreiben mioh
vor Schluss des vorigen Jahres hoffen liess, und der nach einem spatern
Schreiben des Herrn Obristlieutenants Sabine spatestens bis zuni 25 Februar

hier eintrefFen sollte, ist bis diese Stunde nocli nicht angelangt. So lange aber
noch nicht die Beobachtungen aus einer Anzahl von Jahren wirklich vorliegen,
und, wie ich hinzusetzen muss, bevor solche nicht einer in gewissem Grade
schon ins Einzelne gehenden Verarbeitung unterworfen sind, lasst sich un-
moglich ein Urtheil dariiber fallen, ob und in welchem Maasse die vorgeset-
sten Zwecke bereits erreicht seien.

   Von meineni Standpunkte aus muss ich demnach, gerade dieser Ungewiss-

heit wegen, dringend wunschen, dass diese Arbeiten wenigstens noch einige
Jahre in der bisherigen Art und Ausdehnung fortgesetzt werden.

    Ich muss aber noch weiter gehen, und meine unversichtliche HofFnung
aussprechen, dass das Britisches Gouvernement vorzugsweise diesem Zweige
wissenschaftlicher Bestrebungen eine fortdauernde Pflege zuwenden, und
jenen Anstalten auf unbestimmte Zeit ihren Bestand sichern werde, mochte
es auch nur mit gewissen Einschrankungen sein. Sollte es, der Kosten we-
gen, fiir nothige erachtet werden, gewisse Beschrankungen eintreten zu las-
sen, so wurden solche meines Erachtens sich auf die Terminsbeobachtungen
und auf die stiindlichen Aufzeichnungen beziehen konnen, und zwar so, dass
man die erstern demnachst ganz aufhoren liesse, die letztern aber, anstatt wie
bisher von 2 zu 2 Stunden, kiinftig nur von 6 zu 6, oder allenfalls auch nur
von 8 zu 8 Stunden ausfiihrte, in Folge welcher Abanderungen das Personal
und die Unterhaltungskosten wesentlich wurden verringert werden konnen.

Ob aber diese Einschrankungen schon sofort, oder erst nach einigen Jahren

eintreten sollen, dariiber kann ich, aus oben angefiihrten Griinden, fiir jetzt
noch kein bestimmtes Urtheil aussprechen.

    Neben jenen taglich drei oder viermahl, in gleichen Zwischenzeiten zu
machenden Aufzeichnungen der magnetischen Elemente, wiirde die jahrlich
mehreremahl mit ausserster Sorgfalt auszufahrende absolute Bestimmung
derselben das Hauptgeschaft bilden, unbeschadet derjenigen andern Arbeiten,
welche die Vorsteher der Anstalten nach gemeinschaftlich unter sich zu tref-
fenden Verabredungen ausfiihren mochten, und wobei haufiger wechselseit-
iger Austausch von Magnetstaben und Apparaten manche lehrreiche Resul-
tate geben, auch dieThatigkeit und dieGeschicklichkeit der Vorsteher vielfach
bewahren und controUiren konnten. Dass iiberhaupt denjenigen Vorstehern,
die auf angemessene Art ihre Talente und ihrer Eifer schon bewahrt haben,
ein etwas freierer Spielraum fiir ihre Thatigkeit gelassen wurde, mochte ich

fiir sehr rathsam halten.

    Die Griinde fiir das nachhaltige Fortbestehen dieser Anstalten liegen iibri-
gens so nahe,,dass es unnothig scheint, sie weitlauftig zu entwickeln. Unsere

kenntniss des Erdmagnetismus ist nur erst ein diirftiges Stiickwerk, so lange
wir uns nur auf eine bestimmte Zeitepoche beschranken, und nicht die schon
nach wenigen Jahren sich merkliche machenden Sacularanderungen mit
gleicher Sorgfall und Liebe verfolgen. Allerdings ist dazu das Zusaipmen-
wirken sehr vieler Wissenschaftsfreunde an sehr vielen Punkten der Erdober-
flache nothvvendig, und ein halbes oder ganzes Dutzend magnetischer Obser-
vatorien iiber die ganze Erde zerstreuet kann fiir sich allein betrachtet nur
einen kleinen Beitrag liefern. Aber diese Muster Observatorien werden zu-
gleich die Pflanzschulen von vielen tiichtigen Beobachtern werden, die ihre
Thatigkeit iiberall hin verbreiten. Sie werden ferner reisenden Beobachtern
zu Wasser und Lande Gelegenheit geben, ihre Instrumente zu priifen urld zu
berichtigen, und ihre Beobachtungsgeschicklichkeit zu bewahren und zu ver-
--44 REPORT 1845.

voUkommnen. Sie werden endlich dazu beitragen den Sinn fiir Erreichung
moglich grb'sster Scharfe, der sonst nur in der Astronomic und hohern Geo-
diisie zu treffen war, audi fiir die andern Theile der Naturwissenschaften zu
beleben, zu niihren und zu verbreiten.

    Die Privatthiitigkeit ira Felde der magnetischen Beobachtungen liegt ubri-
gens was Deutschland und die benachbarten Lander betrifFt seit einer Reihe
von Jahren offenkundig vor. Obgleich man nicht sagen kann, dass die Bri-

tischen Austalten dieselbe erst erweckt haben, da sie bekanntlich schon vor
denselben vorhanden war, so baben doch diese Anstalten an mehrern Orten
Erweiterung jener ThJitigkeit veranlasst. ' Daran aber ist jedenfalls nicht zu
zweifehi, dass wenn die Britische Regierung ihre aussereuropaischen An-
stalten eingehen liesse, dies auch einen entmuthigenden Einfluss auf die in

Deutschland und anderwerts bestehenden Anstalten haben wiirde, um so

mehr, da das Erscheinen des Organs dieser Thatigkeit, der Resultate des
Magnetischen Vereins, seit der Entfernung des Professors Weber von Gottin-
gen auf unbestimmte Zeit suspendirt ist.

    This indeed is all I have to say under present circumstances. I had de-

layed my reply, which you expected to receive before 10th March, till today,

in hopes to get the promised volume for inspection. But I can tarry no longer
now (though Mr. Sabine's letter seems to prorogate the ultimate term to 31st
March), because, even if that volume should arrive tomorrow or in the next

days, I am for the next weeks so overcharged with other affairs, that it would

be impossible to give it a close examination. I conclude therefore with the
assurance that I ever remain

                   Faithfully yours,

                             Ch. Fr. Gauss.

(^Translation.)

   Much as I feel honoured by your appearing to attach a value to my judge-

ment in regard to the longer continuance of the magnetic establishments
which the munificence of the British government has founded in different

parts of the world, my regret is equally great that I cannot give to your

questions answers as definite, and this chiefly because the results of the work
executed in those establishments are still almost wholly unknown to me. I
have as yet only received the 1st volume of the Greenwich magnetic obser-
vations, and one volume of extraordinary magnetic disturbances, both which

arrived duly, and I return my best thanks for them; but the 1st volume of

the observations of the extra European British stations, which your letter

made me hope for before the close of the year, and which, by a later letter

from Colonel Sabine, should have arrived at latest on the 25th of February,
has not yet reached me. But until the observations of some years are actually
seen, and I must add, until they have undergone a certain degree of discus-
sion and examination in detail, it is impossible to pronounce a judgement as

to whether, and how far, the proposed objects are already obtained.
   In my present position, therefore, and on account of this very uncer-

tainty, I can only urgently desire that these labours may be continued at
least for some years longer, in the same manner and to the same extent as

hitherto.

   But I must go still further, and must express my confident hope that the

British government will apply to this branch of science especially its perse-
vering care, and that it will secure these establishments for an indefinite
period, even should it be with certain limitations, should such be thought
necessary on account of expense ; if so, the reductions might, I conceive,
apply to terms and to hourly observations, discontinuing the former altogether,
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROIiOGICAL. OBSERVATIONS. 45

and reducing the latter to six-hourly or even eight-hourly records, which would
materially lessen the personal staff and therefore the expense. But whether
such reduction may take place yet, or whether only at the end of some years
longer, is a question concerning which for the I'easons already given I can
pronounce no decided opinion at present.

   The principal employment at each observatory, in addition to the daily
observations at equal intervals of six or eight hours, will be to make, several
times a year, absolute determinations with the most extreme care, and this
without prejudice to other work which the directors of the different establish-
ments may concert together; among which, frequently-repeated interchange
of magnetic bars and apparatuses will give many instructive results, and will
also keep up and check the activity and the skill of the directors in many
Avays. I should also think it very advisable that those directors who have
shown in a suitable manner their talents and their zeal, should be allowed
somewhat freer scope for their activity.

   The reasons for continuing such establishments are so direct, that it seems
unnecessary to develope them at much length. Our knowledge of terrestrial
magnetism is but a fragment, so long as we confine it to one period of time
only, and do not follow with equal care and interest those secular changes
which make themselves felt even in the course of a few years. There is in-
deed required the concurrence of very many friends of science at very many
points on the earth's surface ; and half a dozen, or even a dozen observato-
ries scattered over the whole earth can, if taken alone, give only a small con-
tribution. But these normal observatories may at the same time be schools
for many good observers, who will extend their activity over a wider range.
They will also afford to travelling observers the opportunity of testing and
correcting their instruments, and keeping up and perfecting their skill in ob-
servation, and they will contribute to arouse, to nourish, and to extend to
other parts of natural knowledge that desire for the greatest possible accuracy
in observation which was formerly met with only in astronomy and the higher

geodesy.
    Private activity in the field of magnetic observation has, it is well known,

existed for several years in Germany and the adjacent countries ; but though
it cannot be said to have been first awakened here by the British under-
takings, since it existed before them, yet they have caused its further exten-
sion. It cannot be doubted that if the British government were now to dis-
continue its extra-European-establishments, this would have a discouraging
influence on the existing establishments in Germany and elsewhere ; the more
so, as the publication of the organ of their activity (the ' Resultate des Magne-
tischen Vereins') has been indefinitely suspended since the removal of Pro-
fessor Weber from Gottingen.

XIII. M. Kreil, Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory

                               at Prague, to Lieut.- Colonel Sabine.

Verehrter Herr,                         Prag,23Marz,1845.

Ich erhielt vor wenigen Tagen die werth vollenmagnetischen und me-

teorologischen Beobachtungen von Toronto 1840-41-42, und beeile mich

nun das Schreiben zu beantworten, womit mich unterm 5 Dec. 1844, das

magnetische Comite beehrte, und in welchem meine Ansicht iiber einige

dort vorgelegte Fragen gewunscht wird.

Mit grossem Vergniigen durchblatterte ich den Band, so wie auch den

schon friiher erhaltenen der ' Observations on days of unusual disturbances;'
--46 REPORT 1845.

denn ich ersah daraus, dass den hochgespannten Erwartungen, die ich von

den Leistungen dieser Anstalten hegte, nicht nur entsprochen, sondern dass

sie in vieler Beziehung noch iibertroffen worden waren. Die Geschichte der

Wissenschaften biethet kauni ein zweites Beispiel dar, wo so viele und mit so

reichen Mitteln versehene Kriifte gleichzeitig und fiir denselben Zweck waren

in Bewegung gesetzt worden ; und da ein miichtiger Impuls in der physischen

wie in der moralischen .Welt seine Wirkungen stets nacli alien Seiten hin

iiussert, so haben auch die grossartigen Anordnungen, wit welchen England

auf die von aussen her ergangenen Aufforderungen antwortete, auf dem euro-

paischen Continents wieder manche Bestrebungen hervorgerufen, welche

nicht ohne wesentlichen Nutzen fiir die Wissenschaft voriiber gehen werden.

Um nur die nachsten dieser Bestrebungen zu nennen, so besitzen wir in der

ostreichischen Monarchie zwei Anstalten fiir magnetische und meteorolo-

gische Untersuchungen, Kremsmiinster und Senftenberg, von denen die erste

wohl schon seit einem Jahrhunderte fiir Astrononiie wirksam in den letzten

Jahren ihre Thatigkeit auch dem Magnetismus zugewendet, und ihre Leist-

ungen in den ' Annalen fiir Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus ' bekannt

gemacht ; die zweite aber, wenn gleich erst ein Jahr alt, doch ihre Erstlings-

friichte bereits der OefFentlichkeit iibergeben hat. Bei beiden ist es mehr als

zweifelhaft, ob sie ohne dem vorziiglich durch Englands Beitritt hervorge-

brachten Ausschwunge, sich dem magnetischen Vereine angeschlossen hat-

ten. Auch die nun in Aussicht stehende Bereisung der ostreichischen

Monarchie zu magnetischen Zwecken, welche ich in diesem oder dem nach-

sten Jahre zu beginnen hofFe, wiirde kaum zur Wirklichkeit gebracht worden

seyn, hatte man nicht auf England's Beispiel hinweisen konnen.

Ich bescliranke mich hier diese unserem Staate angehorigen Beispiele als

Beweise aufzufiihren, dass die von der grossbritanischen Regierung errich-

teten Anstalten manche andere Bemiihungen ins Leben gerufen haben, von

denen die wissenschaftwerthvoUe Resultate theils schon erhalten hat, theils

noch ervvarten kann, und iiberlasse es anderen Gelehrten diese Thatsache

durch die in ihrem Gebiethe vorfindigen Beweise noch mehr zu bekraftigen.

Wenn aber gleich durch das Zusammenwirken so vieler ausgezeichneter

Gelehrter fast aller gebildeten Nationen, berlihmter Gesellschaften und er-

leuchteter Regierungen im Fache des Magnetismus und der Meteorologie in

den letzten Jahren mehr geleistet worden ist, als in irgend einem andern

wissensschaftlichen Zweige in so kurzer Zeit je erreicht wurde, so darf man

sich doch nicht schmeicheln, viel weiter als, wenigstens in den meisten Fallen,

zur Erkenntniss der ersten, in die Augen fallendsten Thatsachen gelangt zu

seyn. Der vorliegende Band der Toronto Beobachtungen iiefert hiezu selbst

den Beweis, da in vielen Fallen die bisher ausgefiihrte dreijahrige Beobach-

tungsreihe noch nicht ausreichend erscheint zur Erziehung sicherer Ergeb-

nisse ; so musste die Erkenntniss der jiihrlichen Periode der Declinations-

anderung (pag. 11), manche Einzelnheiten bei den Stcirungserscheinungen

(pag. 21, 49), die Aenderungen der Vertical-Kraft (pag. 62.) und der Inclina-
tion (pag. 65.) einer langeren Beobachtungsreihe vorbehalten bleiben. Es ist
zu vermuthen dass die Jahre 184'3-45 die iiber manche dieser Punkte schwe-

benden Perioden eingeschlossenen, sogenannten Sacular- Aenderungen so

voUstandige Aufkliirung zu geben, dass sie fiir alle in Zukunft dariiber anzu-

stellenden Untersuchungen eine vollkommen feste Grundlage bilden kbnnten.

Um nur ein Beispiel anzufiihren, -so wurde in diesen drei Jahren die Sacular-

Aenderung der Inclination in Toronto so klein gefuiiden, dass ans den Beo-

bachtungen nicht erkannt werden konnte in wclcher Richtung sie vor sich

gienge. Daman doch nicht annehmen kann, dass eine solche Aenderung gar

umnicht bestehe, oder immer zu klein sey,  sich in einem dreijiihrigen Zeit-
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 47

raura selbst durch so scharfe Beobachtungen zu offenbaren, so muss man vor-
aussetzen, dass sie an diesem Orte eben jetzt im Stillstande begrifFen sey.
Diess ist aber fur alle zukiinftigen Untersuchungen iiber die Natur der mag-
netischen Kraft ein eben so wichtiger Moment als z. B. die Erforschung der
Sonnennahe eines Planeten zur Bestimmung seiner Bahn, und ein Abbrechen
der Beobachtungen ehe dieser, und so viele andere nicht minder wichtige
Punkte gehorig festgestellt sind, wiirde von den Gelehrten unseres und der
kiinftigen Jahrhunderte, welche ihre Thatigkeit diesem Zweige widmen,

hoehlieh bedauert werden.

   Wenn aber aucli manche Punkte ihrer Natur nach nicht durch eine sechs-*

jahrige Beobachtungsreihe festgestellt werden konnten, so sind doch gewiss
andere dadurch zur volligen Evidenz gebracht worden, und was daran noch
fehlt, ist nur der Mangelhaftigkeit der Ins^rumente zuzuschreiben, welche
noch nicht jenen Grad von VoUendung erlangt haben, den wir an den fiir
andere Beobachtungen bestiramten Apparaten zu sehen gewohnt sind. Dahin
gehoren die taglichen Aenderungen und die davon abhangigen Grossen. Selbst
von vielen der in langere Perioden eingeschlossenen Aenderungen wie z. B.
den monatlichen und jahrlichen wurden die meisten Umstande wo nicht mit
Gewisheit doch mit einem hohen Grad von Wahrscheinlichkeit erkannt.

   Wenn also, wie gewiss alle Theilnehmer an ahnlichen Untersuchungen

hoffen und wiinschen, das Bestehen der von der grossbritanischen Regierung

errichteten magnetischen und meteorologischen Observatorien noch um

einige Jahre verlangert wird, so soUten die saculdren Aenderungen und die
Gesetze der Storungen als Hauptzweck im Auge behalten werden, und es ware
die kiinftige Thatigkeit der Anstalten diesem Zwecke gemass cinzurichten.
Demnach scheint es mir hinreichend zu sein, statt stiindlichen oder zwei-
stiindigen Beobachtungen, vierstiindige, also an jedem Tage sechs Beobacht-

ungen auszufiihren, um Mittag, 4'', 8", Mitternacht, \6^, 20\ undzwar nicht
nach Gdttinger- sondern nacli Ortszeit, weil es sich vorzugsweise um eine
griindliche Kenntniss der Erscheinungen handelt, wie sie am Beobachtungsorte

vor sich gehen, und weil fast alle rvicksichtlich ihrer Periode von dem Stande

der Sonne gegen den eigenen Meridian, nicht gegen einen fremden abhangen,
ein Grundsatz, den man schon von jeher bei Ausfiihrung der meteorologischen
Beobachtungen befolgt hat. Bei den magnetischen Terminsbeobachtungen
war eine strenge Gleichzeitigkeit der Ablesungen allerdings wiinschenswerth,
bei den taglich zu fixen Stunden anzustellenden Beobachtungen aber, glaube
ich, soUte man sich eben so an die Ortszeit halten, als man es bisher bei den
meteorologischen Terminen gethan hat. Hiebei ware es gut, wenn die sechs
zu fixen Stunden anzustellenden magnet. Beobachtungen doppelt ausgefiihrt
wiirden, namlich jedes Element soUte nach 5 Minuten zum zweitenmale beo-
bachtet werden, weil die in der Zwischenzeit eingetretene Aenderung sehr oft
das Vorhandenseyn einer Storung anzeigt, welche bei einer einfachen Beo-
bachtung unbemerkt bleibt, und weil bei gut aufgestellten und gegen Luft-
stromungen gehorig geschiitzten Apparaten diese Aenderungen auch uber
den taglichen Gang naheren Aufschluss geben konnen.

    Die magnetischen Terminsbeobachtungen, welche hauptsachlich zur ge-
naueren Erforschung der Gesetze der Storungen eingefiihrt wurden, haben
diesem Zwecke nicht vollkommen entsprochen, weil wenige Storungen gross-
erer Art an den fiir diese Beobachtungen vorausbestimmten Tagen eingetroffen

sind, daher viele Miihe vergebens angewendet wurde. Da man voraussetzen

darf, dass die Beobachter sich fiir den Erfolg ihrer Arbeiten selbst interessiren,
und alles aufbiethen werden, was sie fiir die Wissenschaft niitzlich machen
kann, so diirfte man, wie ich glaube, die ausser den festgesetzten sechs Beo-
bachtungsstunden anzustellenden Storungsbeobachtungen ihrem eigenen Er-
--48 REPORT 1845.

 messen iiberlassen, und ihnen hochstens iiber die Zeit-Intervalle, in welchen
die Ablesungen zu geschehen haben, und vvelche bei gut aufgestellten Ap-
 paraten die moglichst iciirzesten seyn sollen, einige Instruction ertheilen. Ihr
Hauptaugenmerk soil hiebei auf die Wendungspunkt, d. h. jene Zeit-Momente
gerichtet seyn, wann ein Wachsen in ein Abnehmen und umgekehrt iibergeht.
Will man aber noch fernei* Beobachtungen an vorherbestimmten Tagen an-
stellen lassen, so konnte diess versuchsweise, d. h. so geschehen, dass man an

diesen Tagen zu jenen Stuuden, an welchen die Storungen am oftesten ein-
zutreten pflegen, niimlich von 4'» bis 10" Abends so beobachtet, wie es bisher
bei Terminen zu geschehen pflegte, und die Beobachtungen nur in dem Fullc
iiber 24 Stunden ausdehnt, wenn sich Spuren einer Stdrung zeigen.

   Da barometrische Storungen dieselbe Wichtigkeit haben, wie magnetische,
wenn gleich ihr Umfang niclit so ausgedehnt ist, so ware es wiinschenswerth,
dass audi an Tagen, wo solche eintreten, die Ablesungen des Barometers in

kiirzeren Intervallen als gewohnlich ausgefiihrt wiirden, etwa von Stunde zu
Stunde, und in der Niihe de Wendepunkte, welche audi hier ganz besonders
beriicksichtigt werden sollen, noch ofters, weil aus der Vergleichung naher
gelegener Beobachtungsorte die Richtung und Schnelligkeit der Luftwellen
erkannt werden kann.

    In Hinsicht auf Instrumente scheint es mir zweckmassiger zu seyn, die ein-

nial eingefiihrten so lange zu behalten, als nicht eine neue Erfindung sie we-

sentlich verbessert hat, weil bei Differenzbeobachtungen, urn welche es sich
hier vorziiglich haudelt, der Nachtheil, den eine Unterbrechung und die An-
wendung eines verschiedenen Apparates herbeifiihrt, nicht immer durch die
grossere Genauigkeit des letzteren aufgehoben wird. Ueberall sollte man, so
gut es angeht, die Arbeit durch Autographen zu erleichtern und zu vervoU-

standigen trachten. Wenn die von hier nach England gesandten Exemplare

der Baro- Thermo- und Hygrometrographen sich als zweckmassig bewahren,
so ist fiir die Meteorologie viel gewonnen, und sie sollten verbreitet werden.
Ich habe manche Versuche angestellt, nach demselben Principe auch magne-
tische Autographen zu verfertigen ; allein diese Versuche f iihrten zu gros-
seren Auslagen, als ich bestreiten konnte. Ich musste sie aufgeben, ohne von
der Unmoglichkeit des Gelingens iiberzeugt zu seyn. In England, wo die
practische Mechanik auf einer so hohen StJife steht, wiirde man leichter damit
zu Stande kommen.

   Die Mittheilungen der Beobachtungen und ihrer Resultate haben stets um

so grosseres Interesse, je frischer sie sind, und oft kann eine Vergleichung
der Wahrnehmungen, so lange der erste Eindruck noch nicht erloschen ist,
auch zu nicht unwichtigen Folgerungen fiihren, welche uns entgehen, wenn
man die Vergleichung bloss nach den Ziffern austellen muss. Deshalb konnte
vielleicht die Herausgabe der Beobachtungen in kleineren Parthien und in
kiirzeren Fristen, nach Art einer Zeitschrift, etwa von Monat zu Monat ge-

schehen.

   Da durch die Vereinfachung des Beobachtungssystems walirscheinlicli
mehrere Beobachter disponibil werden, so konnte man diese vielleicht dazu

verwenden, die Umgebungen des Beobachtungsortes zu bereisen, und einen
magnetischen Survey auszufiihren. Meines Erachtens ist die Vervielfciltigung
dieser Reisen, und die damit verbundene Untersuchung iiber die Vertheilung
des Erdmagnetismus, derjenige Schritt, welcher in diesem Fache zuniichst zu
thun ist. Die Beobachtungen sollten sich hiebei nicht nur iiber alle mag-
netischen Elemente, sondern wo moglich auch iiber die geognostische Be-
schafFenheit des Bodens ausdehnen, weil der Zusammenhang zwischen dieser
und dem Erdmagnetismus ein Punkt von der grdssten Wichtigkeit ist.

    Diess sind die Ansichten welche ich iiber diese grosse wissenschaftliche
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 49

Unternehmung hege, und die ich hiemitfrei und unumwunden ausgesprochen
habe. Findet die Association es fiir zweckmassig sie gaiiz oder theilweise
zu verciffentlichen, so stebt von meiner Seite nichts im Wege.

 --Dear Sir, I received a few days ago the valuable ' Magnetical and

Meteorological Observations at Toronto, 184;0-4'2,' and I now hasten to reply-

to the communication with which the Magnetic Committee have honoured

me under date of the 5th of December 1844, in which my views respecting

some questions therein proposed were requested.

   I have looked over this volume and that which I had previously received,
entitled ' Observations on Days of unusual Magnetic Disturbance' with great
pleasure, for I have seen by these volumes that the highly-wrought expecta-
tions of the results of these establishments which I cherished, are not only
met but have in many respects been even exceeded. The history of science
hardly offers a second example where so many and such richly-provided forces
have been put into action simultaneously and for the same object ; and as a
powerful impulse, whether in the physical or in the moral world, always ex-

tends its effects on every side, so the great system of action by which England

has responded to the call which proceeded from hence has reacted on the con-

tinent of Europe, and has called forth several efforts which will not pass

away without having done essential service to science. Among these I will

Wename only the two which fall most immediately under my notice.  have

in Austria two establishments for magnetical and meteorological researches,

Kremsmiinster and Senftenberg ; at the first of which places astronomy has

been actively followed for a century, magnetism only since the last few years,

and its results are published in the ' Annalen f lir Meteorologie und Erd-

magnetismus.' The Senftenberg establishment, though only a year old, has

already published its first fruits. It is more than doubtful whether either

would have joined the magnetic cooperative system, had it not been for that

great development which is due to England especially. The magnetic survey

of Austria, which I hope to begin either this year or the next, would hardly

have been brought to pass if we had not been enabled to point to the example

of England. I confine myself to adducing instances belonging to our own

state, to show that establishments and other endeavours which have pro-

duced, or which promise to produce, valuable results, have been stimulated

by the example of England ; and I leave to other cultivators of science to con-

firm this fact by instances more particularly belonging to their own spheres

of observation.

But although the concurrence of so many distinguished men of science,

and of almost all the civilized nations, illustrious societies, and enlightened

governments, has done more for magnetism and meteorology than was ever

accomplished for any other branch of science in so short a time, yet we ought

not to flatter ourselves that we have done more, at least in the majority of

cases, than arrive at the knowledge of the first and most obvious facts. The

volume of the ' Toronto Observations' now before me itself affords proof of

this, for in many cases it appears that the series of three years' observations

is not sufficient to afford assured results ; the knowledge of the annual period

of declination changes (p. xi.), of some peculiarities in the phaenoraena of

1845.                             K

disturbances (pp. xxi. and xlix.), the variations of the vertical force (p. Ixii.),

Weand of the inclination (p. Ixv.), require a longer series of observations.

may hope that the years 1843-45 will have done much to clear away the

doubts remaining on these particular points, but they certainly cannot afford
such a complete elucidation of the variations comprehended within longer

periods, otherwise called secular variations, as may be capable of forming a
perfectly solid foundation for all future researches. To allude only to one

instance ; the secular change of the inclination at Toronto during the last
three years has been found to be so small, that it cannot even be discovered
in which direction it taices place. As we cannot assume that there is no such
change, or that it is always so small as to escape detection even by such exact
observations during an interval of three years, we nmst suppose that at To-
ronto the inclination was stationary at that time. But such a moment is, for
all future investigations concerning tlie nature of the magnetic forces, of an

importance similar for instance to that of the perihelion of a planet for the
determination of its path, and to breaic off the observations before this and so

many other no less important points are properly established, would be greatly
lamented by those men of science who may devote their activity to this

branch of science either in the present or in the ensuing century.
   If however there are many points which from their very nature cannot be

settled by a six years' series of observations, there are others certainly for
which the evidence will be complete ; or if anything be still wanting, it will
be owing solely to the incompleteness of the instrumental means which have
not yet attained to that high degree of perfection to which we are accustomed
in the apparatus belonging to other kinds of observation. The diurnal varia-
tion and all the quantities depending thereon are of this class ; and even for
the variations comprised by longer periods, the monthly and annual variations
for example, most of the circumstances belonging to them will be known, if

not with certainty, yet with a high degree of probability.

   If, then, as is assuredly wished and hoped by all who take part in investi-

gations of this nature, the magnetical and meteorological observatories esta-
blished by the British government be continued for some years longer, the
secular variations and the laivs of disturbances should be regarded as tlie
principal objects to be kept in view, and the activity of the different establish-
ments should be directed accordingly. In this view it might suffice if four-
hourly observations were substituted for hourly or two-hourly, taking for in-
stance, 0, 4'', S'', 12^, \6^ and 20^ and employing not Gottingen time but the
time of the station, as the special object in view is to obtain a thorough know-
ledge of the phcenomena as they present themselves at the place of obser-
vation, inasmuch as their march depends in almost all cases on the position of
the sun relatively to their own meridian, not to that of another and distant
station, a principle always followed in meteorological observations. In mag-
netic terms, no doubt strict simultaneity of reading is always desirable, but
the daily observations at fixed hours should I think be taken by the time of
the station, as has hitherto been done in meteorological terms. Tlie magnetic
observations, if made at fixed hours each day, might be taken doubly by re-

peating the reading of each element at the end of five minutes. By this
means, the presence of disturbance, which might escape detection by a single
observation, would often be discovered, and with well-established instruments

properly protected against currents of air, the alterations taking place in those
short intervals would also furnisli inferences concerning the diurnal march.

   The magnetic term days, which were principally designed for the more

accurate investigation of the laws of disturbances, have not perfectly answered
to this view, because few of the greater disturbances occurred on the pre-
ON MAQNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 51

scribed days of observation, so that much labour has been bestowed in vain.
As we may assume that the observers are themselves interested in the results

of their labours, and will willingly supply all the useful service to science in

their power, we may, I think, leave to themselves what they may do at times
of disturbance, in addition to the six daily observations, directing them at the
utmost in some degree as to the intervals at which the readings should be

taken, and which, with well-established instruments, ought to be as short as
possible. The chief attention of the observers should be directed to the
turning points, /. e. to the moment of time when an increase is changed into

a decrease, and vice versa. If however it be still desired to institute obser-
vations on prescribed days, it might be done tentatively, i. e. by observing on
such days, in the manner hitherto followed on term days, at those hours when
disturbances most frequently begin, i.e. from 4 to 10p.m., completing the
twenty-four hours of observation only when indications of disturbance are

perceived.

   As barometric disturbances have the same interest as magnetic ones, al-
though their range is more limited, it would be desirable on days when they
occur to take more frequent readings than usual, it may be every hour, and
oftener near the points of turning, which ought to receive especial attention,
as the comparison of neighbouring stations of observation may make known
the direction and velocity of the atmospheric wave.

   In respect to instruments, it appears to me better to retain those already in

use, unless newly-devised ones offer very important improvement ; because in

differential observations, which are chiefly in question, the disadvantages at-

tendant on breaks and on the introduction of a different apparatus, are not

always compensated by the greater exactness of the new instrument. As far

as can be done, it will be desirable to lighten the work, and to render it
more complete by the use of self-registering apparatus. If the barometro-
thermometro- and hygrometro-graphs sent to England are found to answer,
their advantage to meteorology will be great, and their use ought to be
extended. I have made many trials at constructing magnetic autographs on
the same principle, but have found the experiment too expensive, and have
therefore relinquished it, though without being convinced of the impossibility
of success. In England, where there are such good artists, it might be less

difficult.

   The earlier the observations and their results are communicated the greater
will be their interest, and it may often happen that a comparison made while
the first impression is still fresh on the mind may lead to not unimportant de-
ductions, which escape when the comparison has to be made with the figures

merely. Possibly it might be advantageous to publish the observations in

--smaller parts after the manner of a periodical journal, it might be monthly.

   As the simplification of the system of observation would probably leave

several observers at liberty, they might perhaps devote the time thus gained
to the execution of magnetic surveys in adjoining districts. The multiplica-

tion of such journeys and their results concerning the distribution of terres-

trial magnetism appears to me to be the step most immediately needed. These

observations ought to include, besides all the magnetic elements, a notice of
the geognostic character of the ground, as its connexion with terrestrial mag-

netism is a point of great importance.

I have now given freely my views respecting this great scientific under-

taking, and if the Association would think it useful to publish them, either in

whole or in part, they are entirely at their disposal.

With highest esteem, yours,                                 Kreil*

--52 REPORT J 845.

   --XIV. G. B. Airy, Esq., Aslronomer Royal, to Sir John Herschel.

  My -- Royal Observatory, Greenwicli, April 7, 1845.
         dear Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of the circular letter
issued by you on the part of a Committee of the British Association, dated 5th
December 1S4'4', and proposing certain queries regarding the propriety of
continuing the existing magnetic and meteorological observatories beyond the

termination of the present year, to which answers are invited.
    In the answers which I subjoin, I beg leave to refer to the numbers at-

tached to the questions in your letter.
    In reply to question 1.
   Several important points have already been made out from the observa-

tions; and undoubtedly, by continuing the observations, these same points
would be established with an accuracy somewhat (but not much) greater
than at present. I do not expect to obtain anything new ; but it is scarcely
possible yet to tell, for want of reduction and digestion of the observations as
far as they are made. It seems not improbable that a great part of what
future theory may suggest can be made out by sinmltaneous observations
conducted at a comparatively trifling expense : at the same time it is certain
that great light has been cast upon the interpretation of the simultaneous ob-
servations by using them in conjunction with the hourly and two-hourly
observations. All things considered, I do not see sufficient ground for con-
tinuing the systematic two-hourly observations.

    In reply to question 2.
   If by " private research" is meant " research by persons not officially con-
nected Avith the various Magnetical, &c. Observatories," I do not believe that

private I'csearch has been stimulated in the smallest degree. The research of

persons connected with the observatories, in subjects nearly related to but
not exactly included in the routine of the observatories, has naturally been

much stimulated.

    In reply to question 3.

   I am totally unable, from want of discussion of the observations already

made, to suggest anything. I perceive that strict simultaneity of observations
and precisely similar construction of instruments are desirable ; and I urge the
latter point the more strongly, because there has been a sensible change in
the construction of the instruments adopted for many observatories, and be-
cause it is far more difficult to carry out any general regulation regarding
the instruments than anything which depends on mere personal arrange-
ments.

   I now advert generally to the general question, as requested in the last

paragraph of the circular letter.
    First, it must be remarked that the object of these observatories is totally

difiPerent from that of astronomical observatories. It is not intended to attach
very great importance to the accurate determination of the present state of
certain elements, or of their secular changes (as in astronomical determina-
tions), not because they are unimportant, but because they can be determined

in a very much less expensive way. It is scarcely an object to ascertain the
co-efficients or argument-epochs of inequalities following known laws (as in

astronomy), because the present state of the science does not admit of it.

The object is, to make out such laws as we can, to use our discoveries for the
suggestion of other observations, and from these to make out other laws, &c.

Now it is to be remarked that we shall have at most of the observatories full

five years of continuous and simultaneous observations. I certainly do
think that these are sufficient to give us, with reasonable accuracy, the first
--
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .

laws to which I have alluded above (if they are not, I can hardly conceive

that any number of years would be found sufficient). And if they are suffi-

cient, then I see that very great mischief is done by continuing them. At pre-

sent, by the greatest efforts which it is possible to make, the Prague observa-

tions are published in a roughly reduced form, only as far as 1843 ; those of

Toronto and Greenwich as far as 1842, and no other so far. While the ob-

servations continue, with the existing establishment of computers, there is no

possibility of hastening this reduction and publication. Now we want leisure

to complete the publication (to the same extent to which it has already gone).

We want leisure further to discuss with reference to more scientific principles

Wethe observations at each station.  want leisure calmly to compare the

results obtained at different stations. And above all, we want leisure to unite

all by some such comprehensive theory as that by which Gauss united the

then accessible observations of declination, dip, and intensity, all over the

earth. As long as the observations shall be continued, so long at least will
those discussions be delayed, and so long at least will the real intellectual pro-

gress of the science be put off.

   I am therefore clearly of opinion that it is desirable to terminate the pre-

sent system of observations at the end of the present year.
   In thus terminating the existing system of observations, I do not consider

that the attention to the subject is at all suspepded. I consider that the at-
tention is diverted to a more favourable direction ; and I look to the resump-

tion of the observations at some future time as a probable consequence of it.
Such observations would probably be undertaken under very different cir-

cumstances from those of the present series. New points of theory would
have been suggested, new stations selected, new instruments adopted ; and the
object of the new series of observations would be, to make out the new laws to

which I have alluded above.

In all that I have said thus far, I have alluded only to the interests of sci-

ence as involved in the decision as to the time of terminating the observations.

But I think that I should be wrong if I omitted to call attention to the ex-
pense of the observations. The annual expense of the Greenwich Magnetical
and Meteorological Observatory, including printing, is almost £1200. This
expense, while the observations and reductions are printed in the same detail,

can scarcely be diminished.
   I request that you will use your discretion as to printing the whole or any

part of this letter.

                                     I am, my dear Sir,

                                     Very truly yours,

                                                             G. B. Airy.

XV. Lieut.- Colonel Sabine to Sir John Herschel, Bart.

                                                                                            Woolwich, April 21, 1845.

My --dear Sir, It has been intimated to me that the consideration of the

questions now before the Committee may be materially aided by such a brief

notice as I may be able to take in the compass of a letter, of what the colonial

observatories will have accomplished at the close of 1845, towards the fulfil-

ment of the objects originally proposed ; and of what further they may be

expected to accomplish if their continuance is prolonged for another period.

I propose to comply with this suggestion, and at the same time to state the

--Weopinions to which my own judgement at present inclines.
I. Magnetical Observations.  shall have determined the absolute values

of the different magnetic elements at the several stations with as much, or
--54 REPORT 1845.

almost as much precision, as such determinations can be made with the most

recent instruments, and in a manner which will probably leave little to be de-
sired on that head.

  We shall also have determined satisfactorily the mean values of the diur-

nal  variations                                             including  under  that  expressioa the effects  both  of  the  so-
                                                         ;

called irregular disturbances, now ascertained* to have a sensible mean influ-

ence on the diurnal variation of the magnetic direction and force, and of the
more regular diurnal fluctuation connected with the sun's hour angle. In

the first two years of the Toronto Observations these eff'ects have been

in a great degree separated from each other, and the mean values of each

ascertained.

In respect to secular changes, we have learnt that neither the instrumen-

tal means which were originally furnished, nor the methods of observation

originally directed, were fully competent for this part of the inquiry ; and

we have substituted a system of absolute determinations made monthly with

instruments subsequently contrived, combined with the observations of the

differential instruments used with various precautions stated in the pub-

lished volume of the Toronto Observations f. This process has already
been some months in opei'ation, and we are able to say with confidence that

it will accomplish the purpose, if a sufficient time be given. I fully con-

cur with those who consider, that the endeavours which we are making, to

place on record and transmit to posterity the present magnetic state of the

globe, would be deficient in a most essential particular, if they failed to deter-

mine the secular changes which are at present taking place at our stations of

observation.

There is also a very important class of determinations which are in progress

of accomplishment by the same improved means that have been resorted to

for the secular changes, which yet require some further time for their satis-

factory completion. I allude to the annual variations of the magnetic ele-
ments. The evidence brought forward in the volume of the Toronto Observa-

tions appears to leave little doubt of the general fact, that the terrestrial

magnetic force is at that station considerably greater in summer than in

winter, and that the annual variation forms a regular progression intimately

connected with the march of the temperature J. The complete establishment
of this important fact in terrestrial physics, and a satisfactory measure of its

mean value at each of the stations, together with similar determinations in

respect to the annual variation of the magnetic direction (which is also indi-

cated at Toronto, though in a less decided manner), may be confidently

expected by perseverance in the means which have been adopted in the last

few months.

For the sake therefore of the secular and annual changes, I concur in opi-

nion with those who desire a somewhat longer continuance of the magnetic
observations at the stations which are now occupied ; though I am at the same
time of opinion that an observatory starting with our present instruments, and

our present methods of observation, might be expected to satisfy in a reason-

able manner all the desiderata which have been mentioned, in a period of five

years.

With respect to the simultaneous observations made at the periods now fa-

miliarly known by the name of magnetic term-days, the objects sought were

of a less definite character, and it is therefore not so easy to say to what ex-

tent the purposes which called them forth have been fulfilled by what has

already been done. Much has undoubtedly been learned respecting the phae-

noraena of disturbances. They have been shown by the Toronto observa-

tions to follow a certain order, in frequency, iij force, and in direction, con-

nected with the hours of the day. The comparison of the observations at

Toronto and Van Diemen Island, in the volume of ' Unusual Magnetic Dis-
--turbances,' the intercomparison of the observations at the several European
MM. --stations in the 'Resultate' of
Gauss and Weber, the comparison of the

American stations with each other and with a European station in the Toronto

--volume, have all shown that highly interesting and important conclusions are

derivable from this class of observations. It cannot be doubted that a more

general and elaborate examination of what has been already done, will both

add to the number of these conclusions, and will point out special problems to

be solved by a continuance, and possibly by some modification, of the system
of simultaneous observation. Meanwhile it may perhaps be desirable to dis-

continue, for the present at least, pre-arranged term observations, and to sub-

stitute for them the most comprehensive and assiduous observation of the

phaenomena at times of great disturbance that the strength of each observa-

tory will permit ; holding all things ready, however, to cooperate in any pro-
position of conjoint observation, that may grow out of the further examina-

tion to which the great body of observations already collected will doubtless

be subjected. Whilst the Arctic Expedition is in the northern seas, the

phaenomena during periods of great disturbance ought to be particularly at-

tended to at stations in high magnetic latitudes in Europe and America, and

specially at Toronto ; as, should the Expedition be detained during a winter,

their instruments will be established in a locality which may render simulta-

neous observations of extraordinary interest and value. I think also that it

may be more advantageous on some occasions to observe the precise instants

of the occurrence of remarkable phaenomena, than to record the indications

--of the instruments at fixed intervals of regular recurrence.
   II. Meteorological Observations. The periods during which hourly oh'

servations have been maintained at our observatories is probably sufficient in

the greater part of instances to meet the problems now presenting themselves

if so, the attention bestowed on them might now be advantageously directed

to observations having more special objects in view. I feel by no means con-

fident, however, that more than three and a half years of hourly observation

may not be desirable at Toronto, to meet questions which, if not already be-

ginning to be considered, are not unlikely to be so in the rapid march which

this science is now making ; and I am inclined to think that it may be ex-

pedient that there should be a full series of at least five years of hourly ob-

servation, obtained at some one station in Europe and another in America;

and that for the latter, Toronto is remarkably well situated.

There are a variety of special problems requiring systematic observation,

of which the solution is extremely important in theoretical respects, and in-

dispensable if anything like completeness is desired in the record to be left

by our observatories. 1°. The separation of the pressures of the air and vapour,

which united constitute the barometric pressure, has only been feasible since

the invention of instruments to measure the tension of the vapour. The facts

which this most important addition to our instrumental means has disclosed

in the different observatories, some portion of which is already before the

public*, are sufficient to show that a new aera has opened in scientific meteor-

ology ; that observations conducted as they have been at the observatories

reveal as their immediate fruits tiie laws of the periodical and systematic va-

riations of the aqueous and gaseous pressures, and their connection with the

variations of the temperature and those of the direction and force of the wind.

* Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1844, pp. 42-62.
       ----

--56 REPORT 1845.

There are however many points yet to be ascertained, which have grown out

of the observations ah-eady made, and whicli are essential to our perfect

acquaintance with the mutual relations and dependencies of the periodical

variations ; such, for example, as a more precise knowledge of the several

turning periods of the different variations. These are now occupying atten-

Ation, and will require some further time. 2°.  meteorological record can

scarcely be considered as otherwise than imperfect that does not show, with

some satisfactory degree of approximation, the volume of air which, on the

average of the year, passes the station of observation, and the direction in

which it moves. For this purpose our instrumental means need, and are re-

ceiving, further improvements. 3°. The investigations into the Imvs of storms
have shown the importance of continuous records being made of the several

meteorological phasnomena at periods of great atmospherical disturbance : at
Toronto in particular these are likely to be very valuable, on account of the

excellent field afforded by the North American continent for the prosecution

of this inquiry.

I have named a few of the meteorological objects which are likely to be

obtained by a prolongation of the term for which the observatories have been

sanctioned. Other objects have been pointed out in the letters of several of

the correspondents who have addressed the Committee. Those which I have

mentioned are all more or less involved in the original instructions, though
the instrumental means, or the methods of observation, required to carry them
out, may not have been so clearly perceived then as they are now. Amongst
these may also be classed, observations on the important subject of atmo-

spherical electricity.

  --I am of opinion, therefore,^ with reference to the observatories originally
--recommended by the British Association, that it is now desirable to recom-

mend,

1st. That the time for which the observatory at Toronto is sanctioned

should be prolonged.
   2nd. That the time for which the observatory at Van Diemen Island is

sanctioned should also be prolonged ; but that the establishment of that ob-
servatory should be reduced to a director and one assistant, reducing the

routine of daily observation proportionally. The personal establishment of this
observatory is on a different footing from that of the Ordnance observatories,

and the reduction will there be attended with a considerable saving of expense.
   3rd. That one, at least, of the observatories at the Cape of Good Hope and

St. Helena should be continued. If the astronomical observatory at the Cape
will undertake the monthly absolute magnetical determinations, and their con-
nexion by means of the differential instruments, the Ordnance observatory at

the Cape may be discontinued, and that at St. Helena maintained.

    Before I close this letter, I wish to advert to the expediency of extending

the system of observation now in operation at Toronto, St. Helena, and the
Cape of Good Hope, to other of the British colonies, where the same objects
can be accomplished in an equally effective and economical manner.

    In cases where the institution of similar establishments is strongly urged

--by the governor of a colony, where competent persons are present and dis-
--posed to superintend the observations, and where soldiers of the artillery are

stationed whose services may be available, and whose employment has now
been shown to be economical and effective in a high degree in the execution

--of a laborious and exact routine of observation, there is wanting only a sup-
--ply of instruments, the temporary allotment of a building to contain them,

extra pay such as the individuals at the above-named observatories receive,

and an authoritative connexion with the head-quarter establishment, whence
they may derive instruction and guidance.

    The cost of one of the Ordnance observatories (including 100/. a-year for
incidentals of all kinds) is 392/. a-year, exclusive of publication. It may be
assumed that five years of hourly observation is a sufficient time of continu-
ance for obtaining in any particular colony the mean values of the magnetical
and meteorological elements, and their diurnal, annual, and secular variations,
as well as the peculiarities of climate bearing on the health and industrial oc-
cupations of man. If the observations were printed in full detail for the five
years, they would occupy two quarto volumes ; but if it were thought suffi-
cient that duplicate or triplicate manuscript copies should be deposited in
different public libraries, and that publication should be confined to abstracts
and an analysis, the cost of the publication would form but a small addition.

   The colonies of Ceylon, New Brunswick, Bermuda, and Newfoundland are

in the described case ; their respective governors are recommending the esta-
blishment of magnetical and meteorological observatories in them ; competent
directors are on the spot ; and they are all artillery stations.

   The volume of the Observations at Toronto in 1840-1 842 is now before
the public, and affords a fair example of what these institutions accomplish
at the above-named cost*. It furnishes also the means of estimating the ad'
vantages to the sciences of magnetism and meteorology, of accomplishing the
same objects in other and different parts of the globe, at an expense which is
small in comparison with that of civil establishments, and which may in some

instances at least (as at Ceylon) be offered from the colony itself.

                             Believe me, my dear Sir, sincerely yours,
                                                                    Edward Sabine.

AuF Ihren Wunsch fUge ich diesen Zeilen noch einige Bemerkungen

iiber die Toronto Beobachtungen bei, welche ich so wie die beiden Theile

des Greenwich Magnetical and Meteorological Observations erhalten habe,

fiir welche Geschenke ich mich auf das Dankbarste verpflichtet fiihle. Ich

ersuche Sie, diese Bemerkungen nur als meine individuelle Ansicht anzusehen,

und iiberzeugt zu sein, dass ich mein Urtheil bereitwillig dem der Manner

unterordne, von welchen dieses grossartige Unternehmen veranlasst worden

ist und geleitet wird. Die meteorologischen Beobachtungen in Toronto sind

nach meinem Urtheil voUkommen geeignet, um weiter in demselben Weise

fortgesetzt, jede Frage zu beantworten, welche in Beziehung auf die barometri-

schen, thermischen und hygrometrischen Vei'haltnisse der Atmosphare in

Riicksicht auf die periodischen Veranderungen derselben auf dem jetzigen

Standpunkte der Wissenschaft aufgeworfen werden konnen. Auch lasst die

Redaction derselben in dieser Beziehung, so viel ich sehe, nichts zu wiinschen

* dE392 is the annual amount of the sum paid by the public for one of these establish-

ments, which would not be paid if the establishment did not exist. It does not include the

regimental pay (nearly an equal sum) of the officer and men employed in the observatory,

because they continue to form a part of the peace estabhshment of the regiment of artilleiy,

Aand of the available strength of the corps in the particular colony.  discretionary power

has been given by the Master-General of the Ordnance to the commanding officer of artillery

in each colony, to stop the work of an observatory on the occurrence of an emergency

requiring the military services of all ; but at all other times, whilst thus temporarily occupied
in rendering scientific services, their mihtary duties are performed gratuitously by their
brother officers and soldiers, and form to that extent a contribution to science on the part of
the whole regiment.

Detaillirte Beobachtungsjournale dieueii aber ausserdem dazu, die niit den

periodischen Veranderungen sich verwebenden Veranderungen kennen zu

leriien, welche vorzugsweise von einer Anderung in der Windesrichtung

abhangen. Ziehe icli zumBeispiel an alien den Tagen, an welchen Mittags

N.W. beobachtet wurde, die vorhergehende Ablesung des Barometers um 10''
von der Mittagsbeobachtung, oder diese von der um 2^ erhaltenen ab, so

werde icli unmittelbar erfahren, ob auch in Nordamerika mit N.W. das

Barometer steigt d. h. ob der N.W. der Uebergang eines warmeren leichteren

Windes in einen schwereren kiilteren ist. Bei den grossen Bogen, durch

welche die Windfahne sich dreht, sind nahe abstehende Beobachtung wiinsch-

enswerth, und bei der Seltenheit mancher Richtungen wird man bei solchen

Rechnungen so viel Aufzeichnungen der Windesrichtung wiinschen, als iiber-

haupt Ablesungen andrer Instrumente erfolgt sind. In Beziehung auf die

Auffindung der Gesetze der von der Windesrichtung abhangigen Veran-

derungen, scheint es mir dalier hdchst wiinschenswerth, auch samtliche Auf-

Umzeichnungen der Windesrichtungen zu erhalten.  den Raum zu ersparen,

konnte zugleich the pressure etwa so angegeben werden, SWg SW, wo die

danebenstehende Zahl den Druck bezeichnete.
   Was bei dem grossartigen Englischen und Russischen Unternehmen, denen

sich die Stationen Briissel, Miinchen und Prag so verdienstlich angeschlossen

haben, rair vorzugsweise wiinschenswerth scheint, ist dass das erhaltene Beo-

bachtungsmaterial nicht bios publicirt werde, um wie die Mannheimer

Ephemeriden fast ein halbes Jahrhundert unbenutzt zu liegen, sondern dass

sobald als moglich Resultate daraus gezogen werden, um zu zeigen, was auf
diesem Wege geleistet werden kann. Die grossen damit verkniipften Reck-

nungen verlangen aber eine Theilung der Arbeit. Ich Aviirde daher vorschla-

gen, dass die British Association diese Vertheilung iJbernehme, wie sie in

ahnlicher Weise in Beziehung auf die Sterncharten von der Berliner Akade-

Ummie ausgegangen ist.  zum Beispiel also die von der Windesrichtung

abhangigen Veranderungen des Druckes der Luft und der Dampfe, ebenso

die der Temperatur kennen zu lernen, miisste z. B. fiir jede Windesrichtung

Umdie Verandcrung jener drei Grossen in 4 Stunden berechnet werden.

aber die periodische Veriinderung zu eliminiren, miissten die Beobachtungen

um 12, 2, 4 ... . noch nicht zu einem gemeinsamen Mittel vereinigt werden.

Ich wiirde mich z. B. gern anheischig machen, fiir eine der Stationen in

jedem Jahre diese Rechnung zu iibernehmen. Nach einem Zeitraum von

5 Jahren konnten die so gesammelten Data dann vereinigt werden und man

wiirde durch die Stationen Greenwich, Newfoundland, Toronto, Van Diemen's

Land, Petersburg, Barnaul, Nertchinsk, Peking, Briissel, Miinchen, Prag eine

sehr geniigende Beantwortung der Frage erhalten, welchen modificirenden

Einfluss die Lage an der Ost- oder Westseite eine Meeres, im Innern der

Continente oder an der Kiiste, auf der nordlichen oder sUdlichen Erdhalfte

habe.

   Da man annehmen darf, dass, so wie zwischen den Tropen die Luftmenge,

welche unten nach dem ^Equator hinfliest, compensirt wird durch einen ent-

gegengesetzten Strom in der Hohe, auch die neben einander liegenden Strome

in der gemassigten Zone einander in der Weise das Gleichgewicht halten,

dass, was innerhalb eines Jahres iiber gewisse Stellen eines Parallels dem

Pole zufliesst, iiber andre Stellen desselben Parallels zum ^Equator zuriick-
kehrt, so sollte man zunachst mit Berlicksichtigung der Intensitat entweder

an keinem Orte eine vorherschende Windesrichtung erwarten, oder an einigen

eine der andern entgegengesetzte. Aber die Luft, welche vom ^Equator
ON MAGNETICAli AND METEOROLOGICAIi OBSERVATIONS. 59

her den Parallel vibewchreitet, kommt bei diesetn mit einer hohen Tempera-
tur an, welche sie bei ihrem weitern Fortschreiten nach dem Pole immer mehr

an den Boden* iiber welchen sie stromt, abgiebt, welche sie daher bei ihrer

Riickkehr zum Parallel nach dem Equator hin nicht wieder mitbringt. Kal-
tere Luft nimmt einen geringeren Raum e.in als warmere. Der Luftstrom
ist daher, wenn er vom Pole zum jEquator fliesst, schraaler als wenn er dem
Pole zustromt. Findet diess Hin- und Herstromen in veranderlichen Bet-

ten statt, so wird derselbe Beobachtungsort nothwendig ofter in einem Siid-

strome sich befinden, als in einem Nordstrome, die Anzahl der siidlichen

Winde also im ganzen Jahre die der nordlichen iibertreffen. Da aber aus-

serdeni die siidlichen feuchten Winde in immer erneuerten Niederschlagen
ihren Wasserdampf in Foi-m von ilegen, &c. absetzen, so kehrt zwar in dem
trocknem nordlichen Winde dieselbe Luftmasse nach dem ^Equator zuriick,
welche als Siidstrom dem Pole zufloss, aber das, was als luftformiger Begleiter
auf dem Hinwege mit die Quecksilbersaiile hob, fliesst theilweise unter dem
Gefasse des Barometers als tropfbar Fliissiges zuriick, ohne zur Hebung des
Quecksilbers mitzuwirken. Bei Erwagung der eben besprochenen Verander-

ungen, welche die Luft zwischen Hingang nach den Polen und Riickkehr
von ihnen erf ahrt, sieht man ein, dass in der ganzen gemassigten Zone die
mittlere Windesrichtung eine sequatoriale sein kann, welche wegen der Dre-

hung der Erde in der nordlicher Erdhalfte eine siidwestliche, in der siidli-
cher eine nordwestliche wird. Es ist aber klar, dass innerhalb einzelner Theile
der jahrlichen Periode an einem Ort die Luft nach dem Pole, an andern nach
dem Equator stromen wird, ja es scheint diess im AUgemeinen in der Weise
stattzufinden, dass wahrend in Nordamerika im Sommer die Windesrichtung
verhaltnissmassig siidlicher ist als im Winter, das Umgekehrte in Europa

stattfindet. Bei der Veranderlichkeit der mittlern Windesrichtung iiberhaupt

lasst sich diese Frage nur durch gleichzeitige Beobachtungen entscheiden, ein
neuer Grund die beobachteten Windesrichtungen in aller VoUstandigkeit zu

erhalten.

den mittleren Barometerstand. Besitzt man also eine barometrische Windrose,

solche Berechnungen ist nur zu denken, wenn die Windesrichtungen mit den

entsprechenden Ablesuhgen vollstandig publicirt sind. Ob der so ungenugsam

Einfluss erheblich oder nicht ist, ist ganz gleichgiiltig, denn es ist ein eben
solcher Fortschritt, wenn man eine mogliche Erklarung als ungenugsam
beseitigt, als wenn man eine vermuthete rechtfertigt. Die Aufnahme der

Intensitatsbestiinmungen verandert die Aufgabe. Bis jetzt nennt man die

mitlere Temperatur eines Ortes das arithmetische Mittel einander nahe lie-

gender gleichweit abstehender Beobachtungen innerhalb der zu betrachtenden

Periode. Da aber wahrend der Wind stiirmischer weht mehr Luft iiber den

Beobachtungsort stromt als bei langsamen Luftstrome, so ist die Zahl, welche
--60 REPORT 1845.

die mittlere Teraperatur der uber den Beobachtungsort stromenden Luft

angiebt eine andre als das was man als mittlere Temperatur des Zeitraumes
bis jetzt allein betrachtet hat. Es ist nicht unwahrscheinlich, dass bei gewisse
meteorologischen Fragen es sicli um diese Zahlen handelt, und es wird daher
ein wenn auch anniiherndes Intensittitsmaass ein wichtiger Beitrag wo aber

ebenfalls jede Intensitatsmessung mit der gleichzeitige barometrischen, ther-
mischen und hygroraetrischen combinirt werden muss.

   Die wichtige Frage, ob bei liorizontaler Bewegung der atmospharischen
Luft eine Sonderutig der trocknen Luft und der ihnen beigemengten Was-
serdanipfe zu machen sei, wie es bei den periodisehen Anderungen wohl nun
erwiesen ist, wird durcli die angestellten Beobachtungen ebenfalls erledigt

werden.
   Diess sind die Griinde welche es mir wiinschenswerth erscheinen lassen, den

speciellen Angaben des Standes der Instrumente auch noch die der Windes-
richtungen hinzuzufiigen. Es ist diess aber auch der einzige Wunsch, dei^
mir bei einer aufmerksamen Prufung erheblich schien. Vortrefflich ist, dass
ausser die quantitative Bestimmungen auch eine Art Commentar dem Jour-
nale beigefiigt ist. Die Physionomie des Wetters liisst sich nur so beschrei-
ben und es ist dabei wieder hochlich anzuerkennen, dass die vortreffliche
Terminologie von Howard beibehalten ist.

   Die Beobachtungen von Van Diemen's-land erwarte ich mit der grossten
Spannung. Ein meteorologisches Journal von der siidlichen Erdhalfte in sol-

cher Vollstiindigkeit fiillt eine Liicke aus, welche seit lange so sehr fiihlbar

war. Auch die Station St. Helena ist sehr gliicklich gewiihlt, in der Passat-
zone ohne Monsoons und dabei das Cap als Controlle an der aussern Grenze

des Passat.
    Entschuldigen Sie alle diese fliichtigen Bemerkungen, die ich deutsch

schreibe, um den Brief nicht aufzuhalten. Ich freue mich ini Voraus an den

Besprechungen Theil nehmen zu konnen, welche iiber ein so grossartiges
Unternehmen unter Mannern stattfinden werden, die im Stande sind unter so
verschiedenen Himmelstrichen der Natur Fragen vorzulegen. Das einzige
was ein deutscher Naturforscher zu bringen im Stande ist, ist das Versprechen
sich bei den Arbeiten, welche nun erfodert werden, zu betlieiligen, so Aveit
diess der Sache forderlich sein kann. Meteorologische Untersuchungen
konnen im giinstigsten Falle von eineni Einzelnen m ohl angeregt werden,
sie bediirfen aber zu ihrer weitern Forderung des Zusammenwirkens einer
Gesammtheit. Dass die Meteorologie diess finden wiirde, war immer bei mir
eine stille Hoffnung, dass sie es aber so bald und in so grossem Maasstabe
gefunden hat, ist selbst iiber meine kiihnsten Erwartungen.

                                                             Believe me, sincerely yours,

                                                                          H. W. Dove.

                 Berlin, April 21.

   At your wish I add some remarks on the Toronto Observations, which I

have received, as well as the two volumes of the ' Greenwich Magnetical and

Meteorological Observations,' for all of which I return my grateful thanks. I
desire that the following remarks may be regarded as only my own individual
views, which I submit to those of the persons by whom this great undertaking

has been promoted and guided.
   The meteorological observations at Toronto, continued in the same manner,

appear to me to be perfectly fitted to answer every question which, in the

present state of science, can be proposed concerning the barometric, thermic

and hygrometric relations of the atmosphere, in respect to their periodical
      ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 61

changes. The redaction also leaves nothing to be desired in this respect, for
it is perfectly lucid, and has the great advantage of the tension of the vapour
being already computed.

    But detailed observation-journals offer the further advantage of enabling
us to trace the changes, depending chiefly on variations in the direction of
the wind, which are mixed up with the periodical changes. If, for example, on
every day when the direction of the wind at noon was noi'th-west I deduct the

preceding or IC reading of the barometer from the noon-observation, or the

noon-observation from that at 2 hours, I shall infer directly whether in North
America, as in Europe, the barometer rises with the north-west wind, i. e.
whether north-west is the passage from a warmer lighter wind to a heavier
colder one. Considering the large arcs through which the wind-vane moves,
it is desirable to have observations near together, and the rare occurrence of

several directions is an additional reason why we should have as many records

of the direction of the wind as of the readings of the other meteorological

instruments. With the directions the pressures also may be given, and to
save space they might perhaps be thus recorded : SW, SWj, where the num-

ber expresses the pressure.

   That which appears to me most desirable in the great English and Russian
undertaking, to which Brussels, Munich and Prague have so meritoriously

joined themselves, is, that the materials gathered should not only be published

as was done with the Mannheim Ephemerides, which remained unemployed
for more than half a century afterwards, but that results should be deduced
from them as soon as possible. The extensive calculations connected here-
with will require a division of labour : I would propose that the British As-
sociation should undertake the distribution of the parts, as the Berlin Aca-
demy did in regard to the maps of the stars. For example ; in order to learn
the variations in the pressures of the air and vapour, and in the temperature,
dependent on the direction of the wind, we must not combine in a common
mean the values at the several observation-hours when any particular wind
has blown, but we must first eliminate from these values the periodical varia-
tions by which they have been affected. I would willingly offer to undertake
this calculation for each year for one station. If at the end of five years the
data from the stations of Greenwich, Newfoundland, Toronto, Van Diemen
Island, Petersburg, Nertchinsk, Pekin, Brussels, Munich and Prague were
combined, we should obtain from them a satisfactory reply in respect to the
modifying influence of situation, whether on the east or on the west side of the

-- --sea, whether in the interior of a continent, or on the coast, whether in the

northern or in the southern hemisphere.

   As within the ti'opics the lower current of air flowing towards the equator is
compensated by an opposite current above, so we may assume that in the tem-
perate zone the equipoise is maintained by currents on the same level flow-
ing in opposite directions, and thus that the air, which in the course of the

year passes over certain stations on a given parallel towards the pole, returns

Wetowards the equator, passing over other stations on the same parallel.

should expect, that if we find (taking the intensity into account) a prevailing
direction of the wind at some stations, we should find an opposite direction at
other stations. But the air which passes over the parallel coming from the

equator brings with it a higher temperature, which it gradually parts with as
it flows over the surface of the earth, and which it cannot therefore bring
back with it when it passes the same parallel on its return towards the equator.

Now colder air occupies less space than warmer air, and therefore the current

of air flowing from the pole to the equator is narrower than when it flows
from the equator to the pole. If the beds in which these opposite currents
--62 REPORT 1845.

flo\y are shifting ones, the same station will necessarily be oftener in a south-
erly than in a northerly curi-ent (in the northern hemisphere), and the pro-
portion of southerly wind will in the course of the year exceed that of north-
erly. Moreover the southerly winds bring with them a quantity of vapour,
with which they are continually parting in the form of rain and other preci-

pitations : the returning northern dry winds do indeed bring back the same
mass of air, but without its aeriform companion, which having now assumed
the form of liquid, no longer contributes to raise the column of mercury in the

barometer. On considering the above-described alterations to which the at-
mosphere is subjected on its passage from and return to the equator, we see
that throughout the temperate zones the mean direction of tlie wind may be

from the equator, converted by the rotation of the earth into a south-westerly
direction in the northern, and a north-westerly in the southern hemisphere. It

is plain, however, that taiving the year in detached parts, the air may be flowing
towards the pole in one place and towards the equator in another : and we do
find that in summer the direction of the wind in North America is relatively
more southerly than in winter; whilst the contrary is the case at the same
season in Europe. To arrive at decided conclusions, however, on this point,
we require simultaneous observations, and on account of the great variability,
the full record oi i\\e direction and pressure of the wind.

   If by bo b^ b^ . . . . bg denote the mean height of the barometer respect-
ively for the winds S., S.W., W., .... S.E., w, Wo . . . . n^ the number of
the observed directions, then the mean height of the barometer b will be

         n^bo,       ??3 &3  + ng

         Ml + «2 + W3

   If all the winds had blown with equal frequency, the direction of the wind
would have had no influence on the mean height of the barometer. If, then,

= ^«, Wo =: Mg . . . . Mg, the barometric height b'= '  --- ^ ' ' ' '     '
                                                                       ^
                                                               8

--Thus the diflPerence b b' gives the influence of the mean direction of the

wind on the mean height of the barometer. If we thus possess a barometric

wind-rose, we are enabled to decide whether the mean pressure is in this way
normal or anomalous. The same holds good for temperature and moisture.

But such calculations require the directions of the wind to be given as fully

as the corresponding readings of the other instruments. No matter whether

the result be to find a material influence or not, for progress is equally made

by a proposed possible explanation being set aside as insufticient, or by its
being justified and confirmed. The taking in determinations of intensity

alters the problem. Hitherto we have regarded as the mean temperature of

a place, the arithmetical mean of observations at equal and short intervals
during the period under consideration. But inasmuch as when the wind

blows strongly more air passes over the place of observation than when the

current is slower, the number which should give the mean temperature of the

air flowing over the station may diifer from that which is given by the arith-
metical mean of the observations. It is not impi-obable that in certain meteo-
rological questions these hitherto unconsidered values may be those treated
of, and hence even an approximate measure of intensity may be an im-

portant contribution ; in this case also every measurement of intensity must

he combined with the corresponding barometric, thermic and hj'grometric

record.

These observations will also determine the important question, whether, in

the horizontal movement of the atmosphere, we are to separate the dry air
--

ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 63

and the aqueous vapour mingled therein, as has been proved to be just with

respect to the periodical changes.

These are the reasons for which jt appears to me desirable that the direc-

tions of the wind should be given in every instance in addition to the other

observations. But this is the only wish which I can form after attentive ex-

amination. It is excellent, that besides the quantitative determinations, a kind

of commentary has been added to the journal. It is only thus that the phy-

siognomy of the weather can be described, and it is deserving of acknowledge-

ment, that in this commentary the approved nomenclature of Howard has

been employed.

I await the observations of the Van Diemen Island observations with the

Agreatest earnestness.  meteorological journal of such completeness from

the southern hemisphere supplies a want which has long been greatly felt.

St. Helena also is very happily chosen, being in the trade zone without mon-

soons ; and the Cape being at the outer limit of the south-east trade will be

valuable as a check.

Excuse these passing remarks being written in German, not to delay the

letter. I rejoice in the anticipation of being enabled to take part in the con-

versations and discussions which will take place at Cambridge on the subject

of this great undertaking, between men who are in the position to interrogate

nature in such various regions of the earth. All that a German cultivator of

science can bring is the promise to take part in the work which may be now

required, so far as may aid the furtherance of the cause. Meteorological in-
vestigations may indeed in the most favourable cases be excited by one indi-

vidual, but for their more extended prosecution they need the cooperation of

many. That meteorology should receive this advantage was always with me

a hope, which I scarcely ventured to express ; but that she should find it so

soon, and on such a scale, has indeed surpassed my boldest expectations.

                                    Believe me, sincerely yours,

                                    H. W. Dove.

   XVII. Extract from a Letter from Dr. Lamont to Lieut.- Colonel Sabine,

                                                                                                           Munich, April 26.. 1845.

  My --dear Sir, I have received a short time ago the volume which you

 had the kindness to send me, containing the observations of Toronto, 1840-

 1842, and can assure you that the results have greatly surpassed my expecta-

 tions. Indeed, I believe that very few European establishments have been
 conducted with so much skill and care and scrupulous attention to the various
 circumstances on which the accuracy of the observations depend. This is
 deserving of particular acknowledgement, because those entrusted with the
 care of the observatory might have contented themselves with simply exe-
 cuting the instructions of the Royal Society : in this way also a series of ob-
 servations would have been made, but the value of the results would have
' been very different. The historical details prefixed to the Toronto observa-
 tions agree perfectly with what has been experienced at other observatories,
 and particularly at ours : the same difficulties were met with and the same
 reforms gradually introduced. At present the Toronto observatory, by the
 accounts given in the Introduction to the Observations, must be considered

as being in the most efficient state ; all the arrangements seem to me to be
 very judiciously made. It must be considered as an immense advantage, that
the same observations can be made with diff"erent instruments : the agreement
of the results obtained in different ways affords the best means of judging how

far confidence can be placed in the observations. I have been comparing the

daily changes at Toronto with those observed at Munich and other places in
Europe, but do not think that any law can be found out till a greater num-

**-**ber of places in both hemispheres can be compared.
                 **

   The beginning of this letter might, if you think proper, be added to the
one T wrote you in answer to the questions of the Committee.

                                           Believe me, my dear Sir,

                                                                          Yours most sincerely,
                                                                                         Lamont.

       XVIII. From Professor Ch. F. Gauss to Lieut.-Colonel Sabine.

My -- Gottingen, May 5, 1845.
      dear Sill, It has been long a nourished favourite wish of mine to

pay once at least a visit to your happy island, the seat of so much grandeur

in all pursuits that ennoble and embellish life, and certainly there could not

be a more favourable opportunity than the congregation of the British Asso-

ciation, where almost all, eminent in science, may be expected to be met

with.

The invitation of the President, and your kind offers to clear perplexities

a stranger might be exposed to, have therefore been very strong temptations

to me, and I have long balanced before submitting to the weighty reasons

my state of health opposes at present to undertaking such a journey. Be
pleased therefore to express to the President my excuses, and my deep regret
for my not being able to profit by the honourable invitation, and accept
yourself my warmest thanks for your kind intentions.

Also I feel highly obliged to you for the volume of ' Toronto Observations,'

and the Vlth part of your Contributions, which I received a few weeks ago.

Beset as I have been by a train of urgent business, I could till now only look

 --Sir, I had the honour to receive by the last steamer a letter from the

President of the British Association relating to the combined system of mag-
netical and meteorological observations, which will close on the first of
January next, and inviting my attendance at the consultations which are pro-
posed to be held on this subject by the principal cultivators of the sciences
of magnetism and meteorology at the next meeting of the Association in the

University of Cambridge, on the 1 9th of June.

   I regret to say that pressing engagements will prevent me from being pre-
sent on that interesting occasion, and compel me to forego the pleasure of

attending the proceedings and deliberations of that distinguished body. But
I ardently desire that some means may be devised for procuring the further
continuance of this invaluable system of combined observations in magnetism
and meteorology. These observations, if continued, appear likely to have an
important influence upon the progress of these sciences, and their suspension
at this early period, when the difficulties of concerted action have been so far
overcome and the importance of the observations has begun to be realized,
would be greatly lamented by the friends of science throughout the world.

   I have long desired that these combined observations might be made avail-

able for determining the course of the main current of the lower atmosphere,

in different regions, as shown by the observed courses of the clouds, apart
from the particular and varying directions of the winds at the earth's surface,
and also as apart from the low scuds or cumuli which are borne by the sur-
face winds, for I deem this knowledge as being perhaps essential to a just
estimate of the laws or forces which control the circulation of our atmosphere.

   With my best wishes for the continued prosperity and usefulness of the

Association, and with sentiments of high consideration and regard,

                   I have the honour to be. Sir, your most obedient servant,

                                                                          W. C. Redfield.

Committee of the British Association at York in October ISii, the following

part in the combined system of magnetical and meteorological observations

now in progress.

                                                                                         " Cambridge, February 22nd, 1845.

 --« Sir, As the second triennial period of the combined system of Mag-

netical and Meteorological Observations will close on the 1st of January 1846,
it becomes extremely desirable to ascertain, as far as may be practicable, the
opinions of the various distinguished philosophers who have taken a promi-
nent part in suggesting or making them, with respect to the expediency of

continuing them for a longer term.

"It was with this view that a letter was addressed to you. Sir, by Sir John

Herschel, the President Elect of the British Association, respectfully request-

ing your opinion, as far as the results of the observations had come to your

knowledge, of the extent to which you considered the objects for which they

were instituted as already accomplished, and also of the advantages which the

sciences of Magnetism and Meteorology might derive from their longer con-

tinuance.

    " Considering, however, the great difficulty of communicating by writing
the latest results of observations made at such distant stations, and of con-
centrating into one view the united experience of so many observers, the
British Association at their last Meeting at York unanimously adopted a
suggestion made by M. Kupffer of St. Petersburg, to invite the attendance at
their next Meeting in the University of Cambridge on the 19th of June, of
the principal cultivators of the sciences of terrestrial magnetism and meteor-
ology, for the purpose of conferring together upon the course which thev
might judge to be most expedient hereafter to pursue, and of recommending
to their respective Governments such measures as they might consider best

calculated to give full effect to this great scientific operation,

" I have been, consequently, requested by the Council of the British Asso-

ciation to solicit the honour of your attendance at their next meeting at Cam-

bridge, which begins on the 19th and closes on the 25th of June; and I beg

further to inform you that arrangements will be made by Lieut.-Colonel Sa-

bine and the Staff of Computers placed under his orders by the British Go-

vernment, to bring under your notice the results of the observations brought

down to the latest possible period, and to furnish every information which

an extensive correspondence with the observers and others interested in this

important inquiry may place at his disposal.

" I have reason to believe that the railway between London and Cambridge,

and between Yarmouth and Cambridge, will be opened before the 19th of

June ; and I am further authorized to state that the leading Members of the

University of Cambridge will feel highly favoured by your appearance

amongst them, and will endeavour to make every arrangement in their power

which may contribute to your comfort and convenience during your visit.

"If it should be your intention to attend the proposed conference, I should

feel obli""ed to you if you would communicate your intention to Lieut.-Colonel

Sabine at Woolwich, who will gladly furnish you with any further informa-

tion which you may require.
                                              " I have the honour to be. Sir,

    From the Marquis of Northampton, President of the Royal Society, to

                        the Right Honourable Sir Robert Peel, Bart.

                                                                                                            London, July 3, 1845.

 --Dear Sir, The Council of the Royal Society having had before them

the resolutions of the Magnetic Conference at Cambridge, to which, as a
member of that Conference, I drew their attention, entirely concur in the
recommendations that they contain, and request the favourable consideration
of Her Majesty's Government to the subject, to which they attach the highest
importance.

   The Council of the Royal Society having named the same gentlemen to
draw up an accompanying explanatory report as the British Association, it is
of course the report of the Royal Society.

                                                     I am, dear Sir,
                                                            Yours truly,

                                                                 (Signed) Northampton.

From Sir J. Herschel, Bart., President of the British Association, to the

                        Right Honourable Sir Robert Peel, Bart.

                                                                                                        London, July 3, 1845.

--Sir, I have the honour to forward for your perusal the accompanying

resolutions of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, as-

sembled at Cambridge on the 25th ult., and respectfully to request your favour-

able consideration of them on the part of Her Majesty's Government, and

more particularly of the 1st, ard, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and

14th, in which the aid and countenance of Government are solicited in favour

of the continuance of the magnetic and meteorological operations now in

progress, and which terminates on the 31st of December 1845.

Accompanying this letter, I have moreover the honour to enclose the re-

port alluded to in resolution 1 4th, explanatory of the proceedings which have

led to this application, and which I trust will place their whole bearing in a

distinct and satisfactory light.

I have the honour to be. Sir,

Very respectfully, your obedient and humble Servant,

                                  (Signed)  J. F. W. Herschel,

                                            President of the British Association.

Resolutions of the Magnetic Conference, adopted by the General Committee of
                           the British Association, June 'iSth, 1845.

    1. That it be recommended that the Magnetic Observatory at Greenwich
be permanently continued upon the most extensive and efficient scale that the
interests of the sciences of Magnetism and Meteorology may require.

   2. That it be earnestly recommended to the Provost and Fellows of Trinity
College, Dublin, to continue the magnetical and meteorological observations
at the Observatory instituted by that University.

   3. That it be recommended to continue the Observatory at Toronto upon
its present footing until the 31st of December 1848, unless in the m^an
time arrangements can be made for its permanent establishment.

   4. That it be recon^mended to continue the Observatory at Van Diepien's
                                                                                                F2
                                                                              ;

--68 REPORT 1845.

Land until the 31st of December 1848, unless in the meantime arrangements
can be made for its permanent establishment.

5. That it be recommended that the Observatory at St. Helena should be

continued upon its present establishment for a period terminating on the 31st

of December 184-8, for special meteorological objects.

6. That it be recommended that the building and instruments of the Mag-

netical and Meteorological Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope be trans-

ferred to the Astronomical Observatory, to which an assistant should be

added, for the purpose of making absolute magnetic determinations.

7. That it be recommended to the Court of Directors of the Honourable

East India Company, that the Observatories of Simla and Singapore be dis-

continued at the end of the present year; but that the Magnetic and Meteo-

rological Observatories now made at Bombay and Madras be permanently

continued in connexion with the Astronomical Observatories at those stations

and that it be further recommended to the Court of Directors to sanction the

proposal made by Lieutenant Elliot for a magnetic survey of the Indian

Seas, to commence with the close of the present year.

8. That it be recommended that the Canadian survey be continued until

the connexion of Toronto with the American stations be completed.

9. That it be recommended that advantage should be taken of every

opportunity of extending magnetic surveys in regions not hitherto surveyed,

and in the neighbourhood of magnetic observatories.

10. That it be strongly recommended that the staff of Colonel Sabine's

establishment at Woolwich be maintained, with such an increased force as

may cause the observations which have been made, and those which shall

hereafter be made, to be reduced and published with all possible expedition.

11. That this Meeting have recommended the reduction of the establish-

ments at pi-esent attached to some of the magnetic and meteorological obser-

vatories, in the full confidence, that if, after careful discussion of the observa-

tions made to the end of 18^5, there should appear to be reason for restoring
some of those establishments and for forming new ones, the British Govern-

ment and the East India Company will give their aid with the same libera.'ity

which they have displayed in the maintenance of the existing observatories.

12. That the cordial co-operation which has hitherto prevailed between

the British and Foreign Magnetic and Meteorological Observatories having

produced the most important results, and being considered by us as abso-

lutely essential to the success of the great system of combined observation

which has been undertaken, it is earnestly hoped that the same spirit of co-

operation will continue to prevail ; and that the President of the British

Association be requested to make application to the British Government to

convey the expression of this opinion to the governments of those other

countries which have already taken part in the observations.

13. The British Association assembled at Cambridge cannot permit the

proceedings of this Meeting to terminate without expressing their sense of
great obligation to the eminent foreign gentlemen who have taken part in the

discussions of the Conference, and whose unwearied attention has been most

effectively bestowed on every part of the proceedings.

14. That the Committee which has hitherto conducted the co-operation of

the British Association in the system of combined observations, be reappointed,

for the purpose of preparing a report to accompany the presentation to the
British Government and to the Directors of the Honourable East India Com-

pany, of the resolutions passed at this meeting ; and that the Marquis of North-

ampton, Sir John Lubbock, Bart., Professor Christie, and Professor J. D.

Forbes, be added to the Committee.                      J. F. W. Herschel.
       ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 69

 Report, explanatory of the proceedings which have led to an application on the
   part of the British Association and of the Royal Society to Her Majesty's
    Government and to the Honourable Court of Directors of the East India
    Company, for a continuance of the Magnetic and Meteorological Observa-
    tio7is now carrying on under their respective sanctions : drawn up by a
     Committee appointed by those bodies, consisting of Sir J. Herschel, the
    Marquis of Northampton, the Dean of Ely, the Master of Trinity College,
    Cambridge, Col. Sabine, Dr. Lloyd, the Astrojiomer Royal, Sir J. Lubbock,
    Professor Christie, and Professor J. D. Forbes.

    It being understood that the second term of three years for which the
Magnetic and Meteorological Observatories established under Her Majesty's
Board of Admiralty at Greenwich and in Van Diemen's Island, those sup-
ported by Her Majesty's Board of Ordnance at Toronto, St. Helena, and the

Cape of Good Hope, and those of the Honourable East India Company at
Simla, Madras, Bombay and Singapore, was granted, will terminate at the
expiration of the current year, unless provision be made for their continuance,
and that with their cessation the combined system of British and Foreign co-

operation for the investigation of magnetic and meteorological phagnomena,

--which h£is now been five years in progress, must be broken up, it be-

came a subject of deep consideration to the British Association, in which the
conception of this operation was matured, and at whose instance, conjointly
with that of the Royal Society, it was set on foot and supported by the mu-
nificence of the Government" and the Honourable East India Company,
whether it were consistent with the interests of science that they should suffer
this term to expire without an effort on their part to procure its continuance,

or the contrary.

    Connected as the science of Britain is with that of the other nations whose
Governments have taken an interest in these operations, it appeared alike un-
just to those nations and unsatisfactory in itself to come to any conclusion
without calling for the opinion and judgement, not only on those of our own
countrymen who have most distinguished themselves in these departments of
science and have taken active part in the observations, but also of the most
eminent magnetists and meteorologists of other countries, especially such as

have superintended observatories established for these objects.

     Accordingly it was resolved, at a meeting of the British Association held at
York in the year IS^^, to invite to a conference on the subject all the most
eminent persons in those sciences in Russia, Germany, Prussia, Belgium,
France, Italy and America, who had taken any part in the observations, and

some others particularly distinguished in the sciences of Magnetism and Me-
teorology whose opinions appeared entitled to great weight ; and in the mean-

time also to solicit the written communication of their sentiments on the sub-

ject in question, as a further guide to the formation of a well-considered

 opinion.

    In reply to the request for written communications, which was also made to
such of our own countrymen as were known best to understand the subjects
and to have advanced them by their researches, a number of very valuable
letters were received, which were forthwith printed (with translations of
those written in the German language) and placed in the hands of every

person likely to take any part in the discussion or effective consideration of

the subject, including the President and Council of the Royal Society, and
also the members of the Committee of Physics of the Royal Societj', and the
 Council and Committee of Recommendations of the British Association itself.

    Pursuant to the invitation of the Association above alluded to, the follow-

ing gentlemen attended the proposed Conference, which was held at Cam-
bridge in the week terminating on the 25th of June, viz.

      M. Kupffer, Director-General of the Magnetic Observatories of the Em-

                 pire of Russia.

      M. Kreil, Director of the Meteorological and Magnetic Observatory at

                Prague.
       Baron von Senftenberg, Founder of the Astronomical, Magnetic and

                Meteorological Observatory at Senftenberg in Bohemia.
       Dr. Adolphe Erman, Professor of Physics in the University of Berlin,

            and author of a work entitled ' Reise um die Erde in den Jahren

                1828 bis 1830. Physikalische Beobachtungen.'
       Herr Dove, Professor of Physics in the University of Berlin, author of

              a work entitled ' Ueber die nicht periodischen Verander ungen der
               Temperatur Vertheilung auf die Oberflache der Erde."
        Dr. von Boguslawski, Conservator of the Royal Observatory at Breslau,
               and Professor of Astronomy of that University.

   The Conference was also attended by the Baron von Waltershausen, a gen-
tleman who has taken part in the magnetic observations of Messrs. Gauss and
Weber at Gottingen, and executed a magnetic survey of portions of Italy
and Sicily.

    In addition to these gentlemen and to a Committee consisting of Sir John
Herschel, Bart., the Very Rev. the Dean of Ely, Dr. Lloyd, Dr. Whewell,
Lieutenant-Colonel Sabine, and the Astronomer Royal, the following gentle-
men, eminent as maguetists or meteorologists, were also requested especially
to attend the meetings of the Conference, viz.

       J. Phillips, Esq., author of several works on magnetism and mete-

                  orology.

       Sir Thomas Macdougall Brisbane, Bart., P.R.S. Edin.
       J. A. Broun, Esq., Director of Sir T. Brisbane's Magnetic and Mete-

                orological Observatory at Makerstown.
       J. D. Forbes, Esq., Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh.
        Capt. Sir James C. Ross, R.N.
       The Rev. Dr. Scoresby, author of several well-known publications on

                magnetism.
        A. Lawson, Esq., Founder of a Meteorological Observatory at Bath.
        Lieut. Riddell, R.A., Assistant-Superintendent of Ordnance Magnetic

                    Observatoi'ies.

       W. Snow Harris, Esq., author of several well-known publications on

                 meteorology.

    The Conference was also attended by the Marquis of Northampton, Pre-
sident of the Royal Society, and by Colonel Sykes, one of the Directors of
the Hon. East India Company.

    And to secure at once the due publicity for its discussions by the attendance
 of persons whose opinions are entitled to weight, but who inight be acci-

dentally omitted in the above list, and an impartial judgement by that body
on whose recorded judgement the British Association is accustomed to rely
in matters of scientific importance, every member of the Committee of Re-
commendations of that Association was requested to attend the meetings of
 the Conference, which were held at Cambridge on the 20th, 21st, 23rd, 24th,
and 25th of June, and in which every part of the subject underwent discus-
sion upon a plan previously arranged and placed in the hands of all present,
in the report drawn up for that purpose by the Magnetic Committee.

    In these meetings the following opinions of the Conferience were recorded,
                                       ----

       ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROIiOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 71

 on aii understanding that the general question of continuance should be de-
 ferred till it should appear whether or not the members of the Conference
 were sufficiently agreed on the details of the observations desirable to be pur-
 sued to enable them to come to any affirmative conclusion thereupon :

     In reference to the daily magnetic observations, after discussing a variety
 of suggestions as to the hours at which observations might most advantage-

 ously be made, in case the curtailment of the two-hourly system were deemed
 necessary, it was agreed that the Conference was unable to suggest a scheme
 less comprehensive fhan the one- or two-hourly system, which would provide
 with sufficient security for the accomplishment of all the objects of the daily
 observations ; and that therefore, in observatories whose strength will permit,
 it is expedient that the system be carried on henceforth as heretofore, and at
 the Gottingen hours.

     In reference to the absolute magnetic determinations, it appeared to be the
 general opinion that such determinations of the declination and horizontal
 force should be made at least monthly, in connexion with the differential
 magnetometers, and that observations of inclination should be made weekly,
 and that care should be taken that all absolute determinations should be made
 beyond the influence of the other magnets and with separate instruments.

     In reference to the subjects of term-observations and disturbances, it ap-
 peared to be the opinion of the greater part of the members of the Confer-
 ence, that it is expedient to continue the same yearly number of term-days
 as at present, and with the intervals which are in use, and that it is very de-
sirable to continue to give the same attention as hithlsrto to observations of
unusual disturbances, leaving however the intervals and mode of observation
 during disturbances to the discretion of the directors of observatories.

    In reference to the magnetic instruments most desirable to be used in the
observatories, it appeared to be the general opinion that the differential in-
struments had better continue as at present ; that the absolute determinations
of declination and horizontal force should be made with distinct instruments,
and that the lengths of the bars of the latter should be left to the discretion
of the directors.

    The employment of bars of small dimensions, having short times of vibra-
tion, was strongly recommended for observations during disturbances.

    It appeared to the members desirable that an instrument should be con-
trived to serve the purposes of an alarm on the occurrence of disturbances
exceeding a certain limit. ' Such an instrument would be particularly useful
in observations where the observing staff was smaller, and where therefore the
daily observatories were not made hourly or two-hourly.

    The importance of obtaining observations of the third element (viz. of
the vertical force) and the occasional imperfection of the balance magneto-
meter, appear to render it the opinion of the members that Dr. Lloyd's in-
duction inclinometer might be advantageously employed in the observatories
in addition to the balance magnetometer.

    In reference to the question, whethei" any and what additional magnetic
observations should be made in future^ it did not appear that any were
deemed desirable.

   As regards the system of meteorological observation and instruments, the

recorded Opinions of the Conference were as follows :
    That the instruments and times of observation at present in use should be

continued.
   That it is very highly important that self-recoi-ding meteorological instru-

it might be desirable to hold out some specific pecuniary encouragement for
the invention or improvement of such instruments, under such regulations as
might seem most likely to be effective for the purpose.

   That it is desirable to add to the meteorological observations now made,
observations of the thermometer and wet bulb hygrometer, at more than one
height above the ground, and to register the temperature below the surface
by means of long thermometers, sunk in the ground at depths of three, six,
twelve, and at extra-tropical stations twenty-four French feet below the

surface.

    That the meteorological instruments should be observed at short intervals
in disturbed states of the atmosphere, during extreme depressions or eleva-
tions of the barometer, and during rapid changes ; and that the simultaneous
directions of the wind should be carefully noted.

    That instruments for the observation of atmospheric electricity on the prin-

ciple of the apparatus at Kew should be employed in the observatories, and

 that an instrument should be devised and employed for the purpose of indi-
 cating the variations in the electricity induced from the earth.

     That it is desirable to have rain-gauges established at different heights, the
 heights to be dependent on local circumstances.

    As I'egards the general question of the continuance of the system, the sta-
 tions and their duration, surveys and auxiliary stations, and other points con-

 nected with the prolongation of the observations, fourteen distinct resolutions
 were entered into by the Conference, which are contained in the paper marked
 (A) accompanying this report; all which were subsequently adopted by the
 Committee of Recommendations, and being thus brought before the General
 Committee of the British Association, were further adopted as part of the
 proceedings of the Association, and as such are hereby most respectfully
 submitted to the favourable consideration of those authorities by which alone

 they can be carried into effect.

    Among particular suggestions deserving consideration, it was agreed that

 Professor Erman's offer to act as a committee to superintend certain calcula-
 tions connected with the Gaussian constants for 1829 with a grant of £50 per
 annum, to be placed at his disposal, out of the funds of the British Association

 for two years, ought to be accepted and recommended for adoption. And it

 was accordingly subsequently adopted by the Committee of Recommendations
 and by the General Committee.

    M. Dove's offer to reduce the meteorological observations at one station,
 viz. Van Dieraen's Island, was also recommended to be accepted, as well as a

 similar offer from the Astronomer Royal to do the same on the same plan for
 those at Greenwich ; and both were accordingly accepted and placed on the
 list of reconmiendations not involving grants of money for the year.

     During the continuation of the Conference, in an interval of its meetings,
 an inspection took place by its members of several magnetic instruments of

 recent construction. Among these were a dipping-needle by Repsold, Dr.

 Lamont's apparatus for magnetic surveys, and several of the smaller instru-
  ments in use in the British Colonial observatories.

     The Committee appointed to prepare this report cannot conclude it with-
  out recording their opinion of the very great and important advantages se-
  cured to science by the zeal and disciplined regularity of the officers, non-
 commissioned officers, and men of the Royal Regiment of Artillery and of
 the Naval and East India Service, who have been employed on the duties of
  the observatories ; advantages which could hardly have been secured in so
  eminent a -degree at all the stations by other means. Nor ought they to omit
  attributing their due share of merit to those officers and non-commissioned

officers, who by voluntarily performing the duties of their absent comrades,
have enabled them to undertake and perform the duties of the observatories

without detriment or inconvenience to the service in general. *

[A communication read to the Mathematical and Physical Section, and ordered to be printed
                                                 entire amongst the Reports.]

In a communication which I had the honour to make to the Section at the
York meeting of the British Association, on the subject of the meteorological
observations made at Toronto in Canada in the years 1840 to 1842, 1 noticed
some of the advantages which Avere likely to result to the science of meteor-
ology, from the resolution of the barometric pressure into its two constituents
of aqueous and of gaseous pressure. It was shown that when the constituents
of the barometric pressure at Toronto were thus disengaged from each other
and presented separately, their annual and diurnal variations exhibited a very
striking and instructive accordance with the annual and diurnal variations of
the temperature. The characteristic features of the several variations when
projected in curves were seen to be the same, consisting in all cases of a single
progression, having one ascending and one descending branch ; the epochs
of maxima and minima of the pressures being the same, or very nearly the
same, with those of the maxima and minima of temperature ; and the corre-
spondence in other respects being such as to manifest the existence of a very
intimate connexion between the periodical variations of the temperature, and
those of the elastic forces of the air and vapour. The curve of gaseous pres-
sure was inverse in respect to the other two ; that is to say, as the tempera-
ture increased the elastic force of the vapour increased also, but that of the
air diminished, and vice versa ; and this was the case both in the annual and

the diurnal variations.

    Such being the facts, I endeavoured to show, in the case of the diurnal va-
riations, that the correspondence of the phaenomena of the temperature and
gaseous pressure might be explained, in accordance with principles which
had been long and universally admitted in the interpretation of other meteo-

--rological phaenomena, by the suppositions, of an extension in height and

consequent overflow in the higher regions of the atmosphere of the column
of air over the place of observation, during the hours of the day when the

--surface of the earth was gaining heat by i-adiation, and of a contraction of

the column during the hours of diminishing temperature, and consequent re-
ception of the overflow from other portions of the atmosphere, which in
their turn had become heated and elongated.

    According to this explanation there should exist, during the hours of the day

--when the temperature is increasing, 1st, an ascending current of air at the

place of observation, of which the strength should be measured by the amount
of the increments of temperature corresponding to given intervals of time ; and
2nd, a lateral influx of air at the lower parts of the column, of proportionate
velocity, constituting a diurnal variation in the force of the wind at the place
of observation, which should also correspond with the variations of the tem-
perature in the epochs of its maximum and minimum, and intermediate gra-
dation of strength. The anemometrical observations at Toronto were shown
to be in agreement with the view which had been then taken, confirming the
f4 REPORT 1845.

existence of a diurnal variation in the force of the wind, corresponding in all

respects with the variation of the temperature.
    Admitting the explanation thus offered to be satisfactory in regard to the

diurnal variations, it was obvious that tiie correspondence of the annual va-
riations of the temperature and pressures might receive an analogous expla-

nation.

   A comparison of the results of the observations at Toronto with those of

the observations of M. Kreil at Prague in Bohemia, (published in the Mag.
und Met. Beob. zu Prag, and in the Jahrbuch fiir Prag. 1843,) showed

that the characteristic features of the periodical variations at Toronto were

not peculiar to that locality, but might rather be considered as belonging to
stations situated in the temperate zone and in the interior of a continent.

The annual and diurnal variations at Prague were also single progressions,
and the same correspondence was observable between the variations of the
temperature and of the gaseous pressure.

   The publication of the volume of magnetical and meteorological observa-
tions made at Greenwich in 184-2, which took place shortly after the meeting
of the Association at York, enabled me to add a postscript to the printed

statement of my communication in the annual volume of the Association

Reports, showing the correspondence of the results at Greenwich with the
relations which had been found to exist in the periodical march of the phse-
nomena at Toronto and at Prague.

   From the concurrence of these three stations, it was obvious that a consider-

able insight had been obtained into the laws which regulate the periodical
variations in the temperate zone, and into the sequence of natural causes and
effects, in accordance with which the annual and diurnal fluctuations of the
elastic forces of air and vapour at the surface of the earth depend on the va-
riations of temperature : and from these premises it was inferred, that the
normal state of the diurnal variations of the pressures of the air and vapour
and of the force of the wind, in the temperate zone, might be regarded as

that of a single progression with one maximum and one minimum, the epochs
of which should nearly coincide with those of the maximum and minimum

of temperature *.

   * Siuce this communication was read at Cambridge I have received from AI. Dove a copy
of a paper read to the Academy of Berlin, entitled ' Ueber die periodischen aenderungen der
druckes der Atmosphare im Innern der Continente,' in which the remarkable facts are stated,
that at Catherinenbourg and Nertchinsk (on the mean of several years), and at Barnaoul (in
the years 1838 and 1840), the mean diurnal barometric curve itself exhibits but one maxi-

mum and one minimum in the twenty-four hours ; the maximum coinciding nearly with the

coldest, and the miuimum with the hottest hours of the day. At these stations therefore,
and in the years referred to, the forenoon maximum disappeared, and the barometric curve as-

similated in character to the curve of the dry air in other places in the temperate zone.
These stations are situated far in the interior of the greatest extent of dry land on the surface
of our globe, and at a very great distance from an expanse of water, from whence vapour
can be suppUed. The diminished pressure of the dry air produced by the ascending current
and overflow as the temperature of the day increases, is not therefore compensated by an
increased elasticity of vapour, and the curve of the diurnal variation of the barometer ap-
proximates to the form assumed when the elasticities of the vapour at the several hours of
observation are abstracted. This assimilation in character of the barometric and (inferred)
gaseous curves, which is thus found to take place in cases where, from natural causes, the
influence of the vapour is greatly lessened, ajipears a confirmation of the propriety of sepa-
rating the effects of the elastic forces of the dry air and vapour in their action on the baro-
meter.

   M. Dove considers that the single progression of the diurnal barometric cun'e, which takes

place at the three Asiatic stations referred to in this note, is characteristic of a true continen-
tal climate. It is, without doubt, characteristic of an extreme climate, and as such is highly
instructive. There appears reason to doubt whether an extreme climate of corresponding
character exist at all in the temperate latitudes of the continent of America.

   If, however, vpe examine the record of the observatioas made hourly in the year 1842 at
         ON SOME POINTS IN TttE HBTfeOttOLOGY OF BOMBAY. 75

   That exceptions should be found to this state of things in particular loca-
lities in the temperate zone was far from being improbable ; it could not be
expected that the influences of temperature should always be so simple and
direct as they appeared to be at Toronto ; and a more complex aspect of the
phsenomena might particularly be looked for, where a juxtaposition should
exist of columns of air resting on surfaces differently affected by heat (as
those of land and sea), and possessing different retaining and radiating pro-
perties. In such localities within the tropics, the well-known regular occur-
rence of land and sea breezes for many months of the year made it obvious
that a double progression in the diurnal variation of the force of the wind
must exist, and rendered it highly probable that a double progression of the
gaseous pressure would also be found. It was therefore with great pleasure
that I received, through the kindness of Dr. Buist, a copy of the monthly-
abstracts of the two-hourly meteorological observations, made under that
gentleman's superintendence at the observatory at Bombay in the year 1843 ;
accompanied by a copy of his meteorological report for that year, possessing
a particular value, in the full account which it gives of the periodical varia-
tions of the wind, and in the means which it thereby affords of explaining
 the diurnal variation of the gaseous pressure. This pressure presents at
Bombay an aspect at first sight more complex thafa at the three above-named
 stations in the temperate zone, but I believe it to be equally traceable to va-
 riations of the temperature, and to furnish a probable type of the variations
 at intertropical stations similarly circumstanced in regard to the vicinity of

 the sea.

    The observatory at Bombay is situated on the island of Colabah, in N. lat.
 18° 54' and E. long. 72° 50' at an elevation of thirty-five feet above the level

 of the sea. In the copy of the observations received from Dr. Buist, this
 monthly abstracts are given separately for each month, of the standard ther-

-- --mometer, of the wet thermometer, and of its depression below the dry, and

 of the barometer. In Table I. I have brought in one view the thermbmetrical
 and barometrical means at every second hour, and the mean tension of the
 vapour and mean gaseous pressure at the same hours. The tension of this
 vapour at the several observation hours has been computed from the monthly
 means, at the same hours, of the wet thermometer and of its depression
 below the dry thermometer. The values are consequently somewhat less
 than they would have been, had the tension been computed from each indi-
 vidual observation of the wet and dry thermometers, and had the mean of

  the tensions thus obtained been taken as the value corresponding to the hour.

 The difference is however so small, that for the present purpose it may be
 regarded as quite insignificant. It would not amount in a single instance to
  the hundredth part of an inch ; and as in every instance the difference would
 be in the same direction, the relative values, which are those with which we

  Catherinenbourg, Barnaoul and Nertchinsk, in the ' Annuaire Magnetique et Meteorologique
  de Russie,' we find that at Catherinenbourg in that year the barometer exhibits a double pro-
  gression, but that the morning maximum, which occurs at the observation hour of S*" 22TM a.m.,
  exceeds the antecedent minimum only by a quantity less than 0003 in. At Barnaoul there is

  also a double progression in the barometric mean in that year, the morning maximum being
  still small, and taking place between the observation hours of O*" 54" and lO"" 54°" a.m. At
  Nertchinsk also there is a morning maximum occurring at the observation hour of Q"* 1 7"° a.m.
  In all the three cases the double progression shown by the barometer disappears wholly in
  the curve of the dry air, which curve exhibits at these three stations, as Avell as at Toronto,
  Prague and Greenwich, but one maximum and one minimum in the twenty-four hours. At
  the three stations of extreme dryness cited by M. Dove, therefore the vapour was stiU suffi-

  cient to impart, in the year 1842 at least, a double progression to the diurnal variation of the

  barometer ; but the hour of the morning maximum was earlier than where the increase of

  vapour, as the day advances, is greater.

are at present concerned, would be scarcely sensibly affected. The pressures
of tlie dry air (or the gaseous pressures) are obtained by deducting the ten-
sion of the vapour from the whole barometric pressure.

The double progression is exhibited both in the clouded and in the clear
seasons, with a slight difference only in the hours of maxima ; the principal
maximum in the cloudy season being at 20** instead of 22^ and the inferior
maximum in the clear season being at 12^ instead of 10**. The range of the
diurnal variation, like that of the temperature, is more than twice as great in
the clear as in the clouded season, marking distinctly the connexion subsist-
ing between the phsenomena of the temperature and of the gaseous pressure.

therefore wholly inoperative, though the effects are comparatively feeble du^
ring the clouded weather which accompanies the south-west monsoon*.

   If we now view together the diurnal variations of the wind and gaseous
pressure, as shown in the Plate, we find a minimum of pressure coinciding
with the gi'eatest strength of the sea breeze ; a second minimum of pressure
coinciding with the greatest strength of tiie land breeze ; and a maximum of
pressure at each of the periods when a change takes place in the direction of
the aerial currents ; or, otherwise stated, we find a decrease of pressure coin-
cident with the increase of strength both of the land and sea breezes, and an

increase of pressure coincident with their decline in strength.

   The facts thus stated appear to me to admit of the following explanation :
the diminution of pressure which precedes the minimum at 4^ is occa-

sioned by the rarefaction and ascent of the column during the heat of the
day, and its consequent overflow in the higher regions of the atmosphere,
which is but partially counterbalanced in the forenoon by the influx of the
sea breeze at the lower part of the column. Shortly after the hottest hour
is passed, the overflow above and the supply below become equal in amount,
and the diminution of pressure ceases. As the temperature falls towards
evening, the column progressively contracts, when the influx from the sea
breeze more than counterbalances the overflow, and the pressure again in-
creases until a temporary equilibrium is restored, when the sea breeze ceases

and the pressure is stationary.
    As the night advances, the air over the land becomes colder than over

the sea; the length of the column over the land contracts, and the air in its
lower part becomes denser than in that over the sea : an interchange then
commences of an opposite character to that which prevailed during the
day. The outward flow is now from the lower part of the column, or
from the land towards the sea, causing the pressure to diminish over the
land ; it continues to do so until towards daybreak, when the strength of the
land breeze is greatest, because the air over the land is then coldest in com-
parison with that over the sea. As the sun gains in altitude and the tempe-
rature of the day advances, the land heats rapidly ; the density of the air
over the land and sea returns towards an equality ; the land breeze declines
in strength, and the drain from the lower part of the column ceases to coun-
terbalance the overflow which the land column is at the same time receiving
 in the higher regions ; the pressure consequently having attained a second

minimum at or near the hour of the greatest disproportion of temperature,
 again increases until the temperature and height of the column over the sea
and land are the same, and the pressure again becomes stationary. But now
 the rarefaction of the column over the land continuing, its increase in height
 above the less heated column with which it is in juxtaposition, and its con-
 sequent overflow, occasion the pressure to decrease until the minimum at

 ^ o'clock is reached.

   We have thus therefore at Bombay a double progression of the diurnal

 variation ofthe gaseous pressure; the principal minimum occurring at 4 o'clock
 in the afternoon, occasioned by an overflow from the column in the higher
 regions of the atmosphere ; and the second minimum occurring at IS'', occa-
 sioned by an efflux from the lower part of the column. The first minimum
 is similar to that which has been shown to take place at Toronto, Prague and

     * There are no data in Dr. Buist's report from which the diurnal variation in the force of
 the wind may be judged of in the days during the south-west monsoon, wlien no alternation
 takes place in its direction. It would seem probable that on such days the variation should
 be a single progression, weakest towards daybreak, and strongest about the hottest hour of
 the day.

Greenwich, and is similarly explained: the second minimum, which does not

take place at the three above-named stations, is owing to the juxtaposition of

the columns of air over the sea and land, which diifer in temperature, and

therefore in density and height, in consequence of their resting respectively

on surfaces which, are differently aft'ected by heat.

The Plate shows the curve of the gaseous pressure, and the curve of the

elastic force of the vapour ; and between them is placed a diagram illustrating

the hours of pi-evalence and of the greatest strength of the land and sea

breezes. At Toronto and at Greenwich the diurnal curve of the vapour is

a single progression, having its maximum at or near the hottest hour of the

Weday, and its minimum at or near the coldest hour.    perceive in the Plate

which represents the phsenomena at Bombay, the modification which takes

place in consequence of the supply of vapour brought in by the sea breeze

continuing until a late hour in the evening, and prolonging the period during

which the tension is at or near its maximum. The minimum occurs as usual

at or near the hour of the coldest temperature.

If, then, the explanation which I have offered to the Section, of the physical

causes which produce the diurnal variation of the gaseous pressure at Bom-

bay, be correct, the diurnal variation of the barometric pressure occurring

there is also explained, since it is simply the combination of the two elastic

forces of the air and of the vapour.

The solution of the problem of the diurnal variation of the barometer is

therefore obtained by the resolution of the barometric pressure into its con-
stituent pressures of vapour and air ; since the physical causes of the diurnal
variation of the component pressures have been respectively traced to the

variations of temperature produced in the twenty-four hours by the earth's

revolution on its axis, and to the different properties possessed by the mate-

rial bodies at the surface of the globe in respect to the reception, conveyance,

and radiation of heat.

Prague and Greenwich; viz. a correspondence of the maximum of vapour
pressure and minimum of gaseous pressure with the maximum of tempera-

--ture, and of tlie minimum of vapour pressure and maximum of gaseous

pressure with tlie minimum of temperature ; and a progressive march of the
three variations from the minimum to the maximum, and back to the mini-

mum again. The epochs, or turning-points of the respective phaenoraena, are

not in every case strictly identical ; but their connexion, which is the subject

immediately before us, is most obvious.

  We have thus a further illustration of the universality of the principle of

the dependence of the regular periodical variations, annual as well as diurnal,

of the pressures of the dry air and of the vapour, on those of the temperature*.

* In the tropics and in the temperate zone the heat of summer produces and accompanies

a low gaseous pressure, and the cold of winter a high gaseous pressure. When we consider

how large a portion of the northern liemisphere is occupied by land, which becoming greatly

heated in summer rarefies the superincumbent atmosphere, causing it to overtop the adjacent

less heated masses, and to overflow them, we should be led to expect that in parts of the

Arctic Cu-cle situated to the north of the great continents, the gaseous pressure should be

increased in summer, and that the cui-ve of annual variation should become the converse of

what it is in the lower latitudes. It appears from the meteorological observations made in

1843 by Messrs. Grewe and Cole, and presented to the British Association at the York meet-

ing by Dr. Lee, that such is the case at Alten, near the north cape of Europe. The barometer

and thermometer were obsei-ved three times a day, from October 1842 to December 1843
inclusive. The hours of observation were 9 a.m., 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. No hygrometric

observations were made, but we are able to infer the approximate tension of the vapour from

the record of the thermometer. The quarterly means of the barometer and thermometer in

1843 are as follows ; the barometer being reduced to the level of the sea, and corrected for

gravity :

   Assuming the humidity in each quarter of the year to be 75, or the vapour to be in each
case three-fourths of that required for saturation at the respective temperatures, we shoiUd

have the following gaseous pressures :

   It appears therefore that in the six summer months the mean barometric pressure exceeded
that of the winter months by 0-381 inch; and the mean gaseous pressure of summer ex-
ceeded that of winter by about 0-3 inch. As in this case the curve of the gaseous pres-
sure, as well as that of the aqueous vapour, accords in character with the curve of tempera-
ture, i. e. ascends with ascending temperature, and descends with descending temperature,
the barometric annual range is greater than the gaseous annual range, which is contrary to
what takes place in the temperate and equatorial zones. It is not improbable that in the
Antarctic Circle the phaenomenon which we have just noticed as taking place in the Arctic

--Circle, viz. the summer increase of the gaseous pressure, may not be found in the same degree,

if at all ; for the two hemispheres present a remarkable contrast in their respective propor-
tions of sea and land, and the rarefaction of the atmosphere over the middle latitudes of the
southern hemisphere during its summer must be greatly less than in the same latitudes of the
northern hemisphere in the corresponding season. The barometrical observations made by

Sir James Ross in summer in the Antarctic Circle accord with this inference ; since after cor-
recting them for the shortening of the column of merciury by the increased force of gravity
in the high latitudes, and abstracting the small tension of vapour corresponding to the tem-
perature, the mean gaseous pressure deduced from them, though nearly equal to the mean
gaseous pressure of the year at Bombay, does not exceed it ; whereas at Alten it is only in
        ON SOME POINTS IN THE METEOROLOGY OF BOMBAY. 81

   The humidity exhibits also a single progression ; but may perhaps be rather
characterized as evidencing a very dry season from November to February,
and a very humid one from June to September, the latter season being that
of the rains. The average degree of humidity in the year is very slightly
lower than either at Toronto or at Greenwich, but is still closely approaching
to a value expressing the presence of three-fourths of the quantity of vapour

required for saturation.

   The mean gaseous pressure in 1843, derived from the two-hourly obser-

+vations, appears to have been (29-023 0*025, an index correction which

Dr. Buist gives as that of the barometer with which the observations were
made =)29'04'8 English inches; or, measured by the height of a mercurial
column in the latitude of 45°, 28-988. The height above the sea is thirty-five
feet, and the latitude 19° N.

   The mean height of the barometer in the year 1843, derived from obser-

+vations at every second hour, appears to have been (29*803 0-025=)

29-828, or, with the correction applied for gravity, 29-768, the elevation being
thirty-five feet above the sea. This is less than what is generally received

as the average height of the barometer in the same latitude. From the careful

comparison described in Dr. Buist's report of the standard barometer with

several other barometers, there seems great reason to believe that the mean
height shown by it must be a very near approximation at least to the true
mean atmospheric pressure in the year 1843 at Bombay.

   The mean height of the barometer in the four clouded months of May,
June, July and August, is 29-667 ; and in the four clear months of November,
December, January and February, 29-921. The mean vapour pressure in
the same seasons is respectively 0-904 and 0-623, and the gaseous pressure
consequently 28-763 and 29-298. There is therefore between the two sea-
sons a difference of 0*535 in. of gaseous pressure, and of 5°-84 of tempera-
ture ; the lowest pressure corresponding to the highest temperature, and vice
versa. If we may allow ourselves to make a rough proportion drawn from
a single case, we may estimate a decrement of 0-1 in. of pressure to an in-
crement of 1" F. The highest temperature and lowest pressure are accom-
panied for nearly the whole of the period by the southern monsoon ; the
lowest temperature and the highest pressure are accompanied by the north-

ern monsoon.
    The curves of the annual variation of the gaseous, barometric, and vapour

pressures, which are represented in the Plate, show how much of the influ-

ence produced on the gaseous pressure, by the alternation of the overflow
in the high regions of the atmosphere as either side of the equator becomes
heated in its turn, is masked in the barometric curve by the combination
in the latter of the vapour pressure, the variations of which take place
throughout the year in the opposite direction to those of the gaseous pres-
sure. From this cause the range of the barometric curve during the year
is only 0-327 inch, whilst that of the gaseous pressure is 0-650 inch.

    The analogy of the annual and diurnal variations, considered in respect to
 the explanation which has been attempted of the latter, is too obvious to be
dwelt upon. The decreased gaseous pressure in the hot season is occasioned

the winter months that the gaseous pressure descends so low as to approximate to the usual

mean gaseous pressure of the tropical regions.

It is much to be desired that the zealous observers at Alten should observe the wet ther-

mometer at the same time as the barometer ; the register would also be rendered much more

complete by the addition of another observation-hour, about 6 a.m., which might not perhaps

be incouvenient. The atmospheric pressure and the tension of vapour at or near the coldest

hour of the twenty-four, are important data in meteorological discussions.

by the rarefaction of the air over the land whilst the sun is in the northern
signs, and its consequent overflow in the higher regions, producing a return
current in tlie lower strata ; and the increased pressure in the cold season is
occasioned by the cooling and condensation of the air, whilst the sun is on
the south side of the equinoctial, and its consequent reception of the overflow
in the upper strata from the regions which are then more powerfully warmed,
and which is but partially counteracted by the opposite current in the lower

strata.

    In concluding this communication, I beg respectfully to submit to the con-
sideration of the eminent meteorologists here present, that it is very important
towards the progress of this science, that the propriety (in such discussions
as the present) of separating the effect of the two elastic forces which are
considered to unite in ibrming the barometric pressure, should be speedily
admitted or disproved. The very remarkable fact recently brought to our
notice by Sir James Ross, as one of the results of his memorable voyage, that
the mean height of the barometer is full an inch less in the latitude of 75° S.
than in the tropics, and that it diminishes progressively from the tropics to
the high latitudes, presses the consideration of this point upon our notice
for it is either explained wholly or in greater part by the diminution of the
vapour constituent in the higher latitudes, which diminution appears nearly
to correspond throughout to the decrease of barometric pressure observed
by Sir James Ross; or it is a fact unexplained, and I believe hitherto unat*
tempted to be explained, on any other hypothesis, and of so startling a cha-
racter as to call for immediate attention.

    If, by deducting the tension of the vapour from the barometric pressure,

we do indeed obtain a true measure of the pressure of the gaseous portion
of the atmosphere, the variations of the mean annual gaseous pressure, which

--will thus be obtained in different parts of the globe, and the differences
--of pressure in different seasons at individual stations, may be expected to

throw a much clearer light than we have hitherto possessed on tliose great
aerial currents, which owe their origin to variations of temperature proceed-
ing partly from the different angles of inclination at which the sun's rays
are received, and partly from the nature and configuration of the material
bodies at the surface of the earth : and a field of research appears to be thus
opened by which our knowledge of both the persistent and the periodical
disturbances of the equilibrium of the atmosphere may be greatly extended.

Report on the Physiological Action of Medicines. By J. Blake,

                                     M.B., F.R.C.S. ^c. S^c.

The present report is but a continuation of that which was read at the last

Meeting of the Association, and which has since been published in the Trans-
actions. The investigation of the action of medicines has been confined to
the observation of the effects that follow their direct introduction into the
blood, by means of injections into the arteries or veins, and in most instances
the haemadynamometer has been used, in order to ascertain more accurately
the effects produced on the heart and vascular system. Although this view
of the subject may appear to be of no practical utility, yet I trust that the
results arrived at will justify the course that has been pursued. In ray for-
mer memoirs on this subject I have endeavoured to prove that isomorphous
substances, when introduced directly into the blood, exert an analogous in-

fluence on the animal economy. The experiments I am about to bring fori
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OP MEDICINES.  83

ward afford additional confirmation of the views I have already advanced,
and, with the facts that have been published, will, I trust, constitute a sufficient
amount of evidence to firmly establish the truth of the law in question. The
experiments I have now to bring forward have been performed with the
tartrate of antimony, the salts of palladium and platinum, and with the chloric,
liydrochloric, bromic and iodic acids.

  --Tartrate of Antimony. This substance when injected into the veins gives

rise to exactly the same phasnomena as would the arsenic or phosphoric acids,
and which have been detailed in the last report. The quantity required to

--cause death was about a drachm of the salt.
    Chloride of Palladium This salt is very poisonous, for when introduced
into the veins it possesses the power of arresting the action of the heart, in
smaller doses than any other substance I have experimented with. On inject-
ing half a grain, dissolved in half an ounce of water, into the jugular of a dog,
the action of the heart became rather fluttering after a few seconds, and then

slower ; there was no expression of pain. On injecting a grain of the salt, the
action of the heart was arrested in about 12". The respiration is often sus-

pended for a n>inute or two, and then recommences, continues regularly for
about a minute, and is again suspended. I have observed this to recur five
times after the injection of two doses of a quarter of a grain each ; the animal
lay on its side without the slightest expression of pain, although perfectly
sensible ; there were no convulsions : after death the heart was found quite
still, the blood in the left cavities of a dirty scarlet, showing that the heart
had not been arrested from asphyxia; it coagulated slowly; the lungs were

almost white and anaemic. On injecting a solution containing half a grain

into the arteiial system, violent spasm was immediately produced : the
pressure rapidly increased from 5 to 12 inches, as indicated by the hsemady-
namometer* ; respiration continued at intervals, and the pressure in the
arterial system gradually fell, but was still at six inches four minutes and
a half after all regular respiratory movements had ceased. The salts of pla-
tinum give rise to precisely similar phsenomena when injected into the arteries
and veins ; they do not appear to be so poisonous as those of palladium,

as it requires three or four grains to be injected into the vein before the action

of the heart is arrested. Osmium and iridium, the other members of this

isomorphous group, have not been experimented with on account of their
great rarity.

 --I have only now to notice the phasnomena that are produced by the well-

known isomorphous group iodine, chlorine and bromine. The forms under
which these substances have been used are as iodic, bromic, chloric and
hydrochloric acids. I shall only allude to the effects that have been ob-
served after the introduction of the iodic acid into the veins and arteries,
as the acids of chlorine and bromine give rise to effects perfectly analogous.
Iodic acid and the substances that are related to it present an analogy with
the salts of silver and soda in their action on the animal economy ; they are
however perfectly distinct in one or two particulars, in which also they closely
agree amongst themselves.

   When injected into the veins, iodic acid evidently exerts an influence on

the passage of the blood through the lungs: immediately after the injection
of a solution containing 10 grains of the acid into the veins, the pressure in

the arteries becomes lowered. In a short time we have most unequivocal

proofs of its action on the lungs, by the escape of a quantity of frothy fluid
from the air-passages, which soon causes the death of the animal by asphyxia.

   * The pressure in the arterial system is given in inches of mercury, as ascertained by the
lisemadynamometer.

                                                                     g2
--84 REPORT 1845.

If the dose be larger (25 grains of iodic acid for instance), the passage of the

blood through the lungs becomes at once arrested, and the animal rapidly

dies from congestion of the venous system. After death the lungs are found

congested and red, serous effusion having taken place in their tissue as well

as in the air-passages. The heart generally contains a medium quantity of

dark blood, which coagulates firmly. If tiie thorax is opened immediately

--after death, the ventricles are found beating rhythmically, although the auri-

cles have lost all trace of irritability, a fact which forms a curious exception

to the general rule, and Avhich has only been observed in connection with

this class of substances. When injected into the arteries, the phaenomena

produced by iodic acid are very extraordinary. The first effect that followed

the introduction of six grains of the acid into the artery was an immediate

diminution of the pressure in the arterial system : in the instance alluded to,

it fell in the course of a few seconds from six to eight inches down to two,

the heart's action being very slow ; the animal cried, respiration became sus-

pended, and in about a minute it lay to all appearance quite dead ; after an-
other minute however the pressure in the arterial system suddenly increased to

nine inches, the heart beating quite regularly, although the animal still lay as

if dead ; the pressure gradually diminished, and at four minutes after the in-

jection, and three minutes after every external sign of life had ceased, it had

Aagain sunk to five inches.  most curious phsenomenon now presented itself,

viz. a sudden rise of full three inches, in the pressure of the blood in the

arterial system. This increase in the pressure was followed by two respira-

tory movements, and by slight motion in the legs and tail. After this the

pressure gradually sunk, and the heart stopped seven minutes after the injec-

tion. The chloric and bromic acids give rise when injected into the arteries

to phaenomena exactly analogous to tiiose just described: with hydrochloric

acid the action of the heart does not continue so long after respiration has

ceased, nor has the augmentation in the pressure after the cessation of re-

spiratory movements been observed with this substance ; this might possibly

be owing to its not containing oxygen.

Having now brought forward the facts whicli have been ascertained since

my last report, in support of the analogous action of isomorphous substances

on animals, I propose to take a general review of the whole of the evidence

we are now in possession of relating to this law, and also of those facts which

appear to militate against it; merely premising, that, in the present imperfect

state of our knowledge as regards the isomorphous relations of bodies, it is

not to be expected that a first attempt to arrive at any generalization found-

ed on these properties should not present many anomalies and apparent

contradictions, which it will require further investigations to clear up, or

which may lead to important modifications in the expression of the law itself.

--The evidence in favour of the law is derived from the following facts : first,

the similarity of action of the following isomorphous substances belonging

--to the magnesian class ; viz. magnesia, lime, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel,

zinc, cadmium, copper andbismuth, substances whichpresent striking differ-

ences in their ordinary chemical affinities, but which agree in being isomor-

phous, and also in producing analogous phaenomena on animals when intro-

duced directly into the blood. The salts also of another well-marked isomor-

phous group, viz. lead, strontia and baryta, closely agree in their actions on

the animal system. Palladium and platinum, in the effects they produce

when introduced directly into the blood, lend their support to this law.

Phosphorus, antimony and arsenic, a strictly isomorphous group, give rise to

analogous reactions on the animal economy. The chlorine group also fully

bears out the law, at least as regards iodine, bromine and chlorine, for fluorine
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF MEDICINES.  85

 has not been experimented with. The salts of soda and silver also agree in
 the effects they produce, although presenting a more striking contrast in many
 of their chemical properties than is to be found in any other class. On the
 other hand, potash and ammonia, two substances between which well-marked

 isomorphous relations exist, differ to a certain extent in the phsenomena they
 give rise to when introduced into the blood. It is possible that the compound
 nature of the radical of ammonia, differing so completely as it does from the

 other inorganic radicals, may introduce certain modifications in its relation
 to organized compounds. The only other fact that my investigations have
made me acquainted with, which appears to oppose itself to this law, is, the

 analogy that exists to a certain extent between the salts of lead and the
 chlorine group and silver. As regards the more marked phsenomena pro-

 duced by the salts of lead, they are such as its connection with strontian and
 baryta would lead us to suppose ; but in one respect, viz. in their action on
the lungs, they resemble the salts of silver. As regards this anomaly I would
merely observe, that galena and sulphuret of silver are found under the same

form.

   Such is the evidence with which my researches have furnished me, in sup-

port of the law of the analogous action of isomorphous substances on
organized beings, and I think it sufficient to justify us in admitting that the
molecular reactions that take place between the elements of living bodies
and inorganic substances are to a great extent independent of chemical affi-

nity, but are connected with those properties of matter which are expressed
by its isomorphous relations. It is evident that this law must lead to important
modifications in the investigation of physiological phaenomena : in considering

the action of unorganized substances on organized beings, it is clear that
our attention must not be so exclusively directed to the chemical properties
of these substances: it must not be as alkalies or acids or salts that their
action on organized beings must be investigated, but as regards their isomor-
phous relations, or those properties of matter which are evidently connected
with the form it assumes, and which have recently been elucidated by the
researches of Kopff. But whilst this law Avould tend to remove the inves-
tigation of physiological phsenomena from the domain of ])ure chemistry, it is
far from leading us to conclude that the reactions that take place amongst
materials of which organized beings are composed are essentially of a different

character from those which we observe amongst the simpler forms of matter.
The difference between the more simple combinations of the elements with
one another and those they form with the more complicated compounds of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen that exist in the living body, seems
to be, that in the former instance they combine under the influence of che-
mical affinity, whilst in the latter it would appear to be a physical polarity
that influences the formation of the compound : it is the former power that
gives rise to the union of sulphuric acid and soda, whilst the latter causes
the compound to assume a definite crystalline form. It would appear, in fact,
as if the force of chemical affinity was more or less neutralized in living
beings, and that their elements are held together by other forces than those
which prevail amongst unorganized compounds. In the present early stage
of these researches, I would not attempt to generalize this law beyond that
class of facts to which it has been proved experimentally to apply ; it may
admit of a far more extended application, embracing in its expression not
merely the combinations of the compound elements of organized beings, but
also the combinations of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, of which

these elements consist. In the present imperfect state of our knowledge, it
would be hazardous to offer an opinion on the nature of the compounds
--86 REPORT 1845.

that are formed under the influence of this law, when inorganic substances

are introduced into the blood ; it remains even to be proved if the phseno-

mena they give rise to are owing to the formation of any definite compounds
between them and the elements of the blood and tissues. In the absence of
all direct proof on this point, I would offer one or two considerations which
would tend to indicate that the probability is in favour of the formation of
definite compounds between the inorganic element and the blood and tissues.

    The researches of Mulder on the composition of albumen and fibrine

prove, that the presence or absence of certain elements in very small pro-

portions may essentially alter the properties of the protein compounds. The

whole of the fibrine, for instance, in the blood of a small animal does not
contain more than two grains of sulphur, which however appears to form as
essential an element in its composition as it does in sulphuric acid ; if there-
fore we introduce into the blood any substance which should deprive the
fibrine of its sulphur, either by combining with the sulphur itself, or by re-
placing it in the protein compound, we should immediately have a fluid cir-
culating over the body which would not contain any fibrine, and which might
be totally unfitted for carrying on the vital phagnomena ; two or three grains
of baryta for instance, supposing it capable of producing such a reaction,
would suffice to defibrinize the whole of the blood. Another consideration
that would favour the supposition that isomorphous substances form certain
definite analogous compounds with the blood and tissues, is, that we gene-
rally find that the diff'erent substances belonging to the same isomorphous
group give rise to certain physical changes in the blood which are readily
recognizable ; thus the whole of the magnesian family agree in depriving the
blood in a greater or less degree of its property of coagulation ; the same re-
marks will apply to most of the other groups. It is highly probable that
these physical changes are owing to the formation of certain definite com-
pounds between the elements of the blood and the substances mixed with it.

A careful analysis of the organs on which different classes of substances ap-

pear more particularly to act, would probably elucidate this point.
    Before concluding, I would offer a remark on the relative poisoning powers

of the substances that have been experimented with. The salts of palla-
 dium, platinum and baryta are those which prove fatal in the smallest doses

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

 and it is a curious fact, that, under an isomorphous point of view, these three
 substances are those which have the least analogy with the elements that
 enter into the formation of the animal solids and fluids ; on the other hand,
 arsenic, which might have been supposed to be rapidly fatal, is so inert when
 introduced into the blood that it will not speedily produce death, unless indeed
 it is injected in quantities sufficient to directly coagulate the blood. It re-
 mains for future experiments to determine if this is owing to its being iso-
 morphous to one of the elements of the fluids and solids, the phosphorous.

 On the Comet q/'I843. By Dr. von Boguslawski of Breslau, Cor-
                 responding Member of the Br-itish Association.

 [A communication made to the Mathematical and Physical Section at Cambridge,
                       and ordered to be printed entire amongst the Reports.]

 The great Comet of 1843 was regarded with much interest by the whole

 world, more particularly by astronomers, and has left us some very import-
 ant questions to solve ; that is, we require to know whether it be periodic
 or not, and the marvellous appearance of its magnificent tail should be

  explained. The series of observations of the comet is far too short to enable
  us to derive from it a calculation on the eilipticity of the orbit. Some attempts
  have given negative results, and even a hyperbola, which is however less
  probable than that the observations were imperfect. The review would have
  promised better success, if there had been any comets in former days whose
  appearances resembled this, since this inquiry is extremely limited, from
  unavoidable reasons. The principal are these :

     The comet of 1843 is one of those whose visibility in broad daylight near
  the sun at the time of perihelion is incontestably proved. In our hemisphere
  it can never be seen near midnight, either before or after. Nor can it ever
  be seen to the north of the ecliptic ; and even in the south of the zodiac there
  are but few constellations in which it can rise above our horizon ; only in
 Eridanus, or in the feet of Cetus during the months of February and March
*9xi6. afterwards in Corvus, and in Hydra during the months of October and

  November.
     Guided by these considerations, in the excellent ' Cometography ' of Pingre

 we meet with the comet of 1695, seen in Brazil, in India, at Macao, and in the
 islands of St. Anne in America, pursuing its path through Corvus into Hydra.
 The magnificent tail upholds the supposition that the head was in the prin-

  cipal extremity.

    On the 7th of February 1106, a comet appeared in Palestine (and was after-

 wards seen in China) which occupied that part of the heavens in which the
 sun sets in winter. From it there proceeded a long whitish ray resembling
 a linen cloth, which came to an end below the constellation of Orion.

     Aristotle makes use of nearly the same words in describing (in his ' Meteor-
 ology ') the comet which appeared 371 years b.c, " In the severest part of
 the winter," says he, " this prodigious star was seen to appear in the evening.

 It set soon after the sun ; but its light extended something like an avenue
 of trees over a third of the heavens. It rose up to the belt of Orion and
 then disappeared." Thus we hfive two striking portraits of the comet of

 184.3 ; but resemblance alone decides nothing.

    Of the three comets here cited, only that of 1695 affords us details of its
 apparent path through the heavens. Three .Jesuits, who it appears possessed

--astronomical knowledge, Father Noel at Macao, Father Bouvet at Surat,
--and Father Jacob at All Saints' Bay in Brazil, give us a learned description

 of it according to the taste of their time ; whilst an anonymous observer on
 one of the islands of St. Anne in America, carefully notes down five or six
 times, between the 2nd and 19th of November, those stars of Corvus and
 Hydra through which the head of the comet had continued its route.

     Pingre owns that he attempted in vain to combine these observations,
 in order to derive from them some approximation to the comet's orbit ; and yet
 the whole of them, including the daily progress of the comet, are represented
 in the most satisfactory manner by the elements of the comet of 1843 ; that
 is, supposing the same distance of perihelion, the same longitude for the peri-
 helion and for the ascending node, and the same inclination, and admitting
 the 24th of October 1695 as the day of the perihelion passage.

     The elements of an entirely different orbit, calculated by Mr. Burckhardt
 from the inedited observations of Mr. Delisle, do not give at all the same re-
 sults, and perhaps owe their existence to the same cause which M. Bessel has

 revealed in the ' Ast. Nach.' of Schumachei". The details of my calculations

 will soon appear in that work, and will prove the great probability of the
 assertion which, in the presence of this illustrious Association, I have today
 made for the first time.

    Meanwhile I may be permitted to draw the conclusion that the period of
--S8 KEPORT 1845.

the last revolution occupied 147 j'ears and 127 days, and to mention the
consequences which result therefrom.

    Four anterior revolutions of 147 years and 5 months, conduct us to the
comet of the year 1 106, of which we have already spoken ; and from thence,
ten revolutions of 147 years and 9 months, carry us back to the comet of

Aristotle, 371 years b.c.

   The difference of several months between the earlier times of revolution
and those of the present day, far from disturbing our hypothesis, serve to
confirm it. It is the effect of the resisting medium in space, which has already
manifested itself in the comets of Encke and Biela, and which we might ex-
pect to find acting with far greater force on a comet which buries itself in
the densest beds of aether which surround the sun. This may perhaps afford
a new opportunity for studying this interesting force, which, by diminishing
the excentricity of the orbits, and constantly decreasing the time of their re«»«-

volutions, will accomplish in the course of ages the reunion of these celestial
bodies, which possess very large resisting surfaces, but very small masses,

with the great centre of general gravity.

    Other comets have also appeared at intervals corresponding to a number
of complete revolutions, the probability of whose identity with that of 1843

--is greater or less according to the circumstances which accompany them.
    These are, the great comet of 1548, or that of the Turks ; that of 1401,
during Lent ; the comet which appeared before the death of Pope Innocent IV.
in 1254; that of 367 seen in broad daylight; the comet of 219; and

finally, that of the year 74 a.d. If I may be allowed to include these, we

have accounts of ten reappearances of this famous comet from the time of
 Aristotle up to the present day ; and it is worthy of remark that all were seen,
as it appears, only after the epoch of the perihelion. Perhaps, when I shall

have furnished them with the demonstration of my assertion, astronomers may

like to name this comet after Aristotle, and to look upon it as the symbol of

 that immortal philosopher.
     If it is considered that the ellipticity of this comet's orbit is established,

 it is declaring it at the same time to be both more esoteric and more exoteric
 than any other vassal of the sun with which we are more closely acquainted.

    Immersed on the day of perihelion in the photosphere of the sun itself,
 our comet hastened, with a velocity of more than 414 English miles in a second
 of time, to escape from the great attractive force, making the semi-circuit
 of the sun in the short space of one hour and a half, in order to pursue its
 distant route in an ellipse, whose length exceeds the breadth by nearly 57
 times, the latter not being equal to the diameter of the earth's orbit ; whilst

--the aphelion is 5,316,000,000 English miles from the sun, nearly three

 times more than the orbit of the most distant planet discovered by William
 Herschel of immortal memory.

     There our comet proceeded at the very slow pace of 1^ English feet in a
 second, which however was just the means of reconducting it to the sun.
 If this be true, our posterity will see it return in the summer of 1990,
 that is to say, if accident favour it at a season when the comet is never above
 the horizon during the absence of the sun ; but it will be more surely seen
 in the autumn of the year 2137, when it will present a similar appearance to

 that of 1695.

    I trust I may be allowed to trespass on a little more time, in order to add
 a few words on the tail of this comet, which reasonably enough attracted so
much general attention.

   How is it that no one saw either the comet or its magnificent tail before
the perihelion, neither in Europe, nor even in the tropics? Was it impossi-
ON THE COMET OF 1843.  89

ble? Not at all. Beginning from the 27th of January, the comet appeared above
our horizon, and rose up higher day by day. The visibility of the tail should
have commenced still sooner, and with a splendour surpassing that which it
assumed in the month of March, increasing daily through the month of Fe-

bruary, crossing the meridian every evening with the stars in the constellation
Lepus. Nothing of all this occurred. It was seen suddenly immediately after
the perihelion in full daylight only a few degrees from the sun, five or six

degrees in length, which probably answers to more than ten times as much
seen in the night time. The spectators of it in tropical countries know not
how to find words to express the greatness and magnificence of its appear-
ance. When it unfolded itself to our eyes towards the 18th or 19th of March,
it was already much diminished in splendour, as we find by the unanimous

assertions of witnesses, and yet it excited general surprise in these countries.

   On the 21st of March my pupils observed the tail, already sensibly shortened

to the naked eye, as far as j> Leporis, whilst 1 could follow it in the finder
beyond Sirius, leaving that star to the south. Thus the naked eye only saw

=a length of tail 2| the distance of the earth from the sun, whilst the

finder showed it six times the radius of the orbit of the earth, or 581 millions

of English miles, being of far greater extent than the orbit of Jupiter. And
assuredly my finder would not show the extreme limit of this phsenomenon,
which manifested on this occasion the common law of all the tails of comets,

that of taking a direction exactly opposite to the sun, followed by the
comet from the first day of its appearance after the perihelion. But ivhere
was its tail before this epoch ? will be demanded at each reappearance.

    Is it always lost during the long absence from the sun, and regained by
the reunion ? Where is the force which has each time engendered a body of
such gigantic dimensions ; the force, in a body so feeble and unshapen as the
comet, which can project an enormous luminous mass in a short -space of time
as far as beyond the orbit of Jupiter ; to conduct it half round the sun in
I'' 30TM 39^ for the extreme limit perceived by the finder, a route of 1826
millions of English miles ? That is a celerity of more than a third of a million

--of English miles in a second, a velocity which surpasses that of light by

three-fourths ! This really pronounces the impossibility of a mechanic nature
in comets' tails ; it ranges them amongst dynamic appearances.

    However, nothing is as yet explained by this assertion. I consider even
that only a profound study and perfect knowledge of the works of the late
Brandes of Breslau, of M. Bessel's calculations of Halley's comet before the
perihelion, and Sir John Herschel's after this epoch (including the aspect of
the comet of 22nd January 1836 just like a fixed star), can conduct us to a
more or less plausible theory of this most highly interesting phaenomenon.

   Nevertheless, in such a case it appears to me necessary to endeavour to
establish a tolerably probable hypothesis, and which may explain a certain
number of the facts according to the new principle. It will serve, not only
to show by an example the possibility of the new conjecture, but also to guide
us, when there is a discordance amongst the observations, to points of view

more just and more admissible.
   It is now some time since I endeavoured to demonstrate, that, from the

circumstance of there being no loss of intensity nor refraction from a ray of
light passing through the volume of a comet, the law of the intensity of
their light (which as with the planets follows that of the inverse ratio of the
square of the distance from the sun, but in an abnormal manner that of the
simple distance from the earth) leads us to regard these stars as an accumu-
lation ofan immense number of very small bodies, of which each one possesses
sufficient mass to play the part of a centred body, and which all move round
                                                              !

their common centre of gravity in regular orbits, whilst this dynamic centre

describes the cometary orbit rotmd the sun.

   What we see at the head of the comet is the brightness formed by these
numerous particles being lighted up by the sun, each one being too small to

be distinguished separately. Thence the cause of the nebulous aspect of
comets, resembling that of the accumulations of stars, which often from the
same cause are seen as nebulae. The form of each individual of these corpus-
cles decides the fact of its having a rotatory movement or not. The form
must be amorphous or crystalline, according to the matter and conditions at
the moment of the first formation. This formation may be renewed as often
as these atoms are put into a state of fusion, or subjected to a species of ce-
mentation, which might very possibly occur when a comet passes very near
the sun. Endowed with the facets of crystals, andobligedby theirform always
to preserve the same direction towards tlie sun, these corpuscles may unite all
the requisite conditions up to an eyitire reflexion of the solar rays.

   He who knows how much may be united in this phaenomenon of entire re-

flexion, will understand the considerable illumination which it may spread to

the greatest distance in space.

   We have only to admit that the atoms which form the zodiacal light, seen

lighted up only by simple rays of the sun, are spi'ead over far more distant
spaces, to enable us to explain a dynamic origin for the tails, thus placing
them amongst the phaenomena of the zodiacal light, the parhelia, halos, the
rainy bauds of the Indian summer, and even the general world of atoms lighted
up by the sun.

   Thus may comets be perhaps the grand reflectors of our solar system,
sent us from time to time by the Creator of the world to throw light upon
hitherto unknown parts of his Creation, too immense for our senses, and even
for our minds

          Report on the Actinograph. By Mr. Robert Hunt.

Many circumstances have conspired to prevent the author from completing
Aany observations with this instrument. few rough experiments made with

a view of testing the merits of it, comprise all that has as yet been done.

   The importance of a method of registeiing the amount of chemical in-
fluence associated with the solar rays, is evident. When we consider the

ever-varying conditions of these radiations, producing remarkable phaeno-
mena, not merely during the changes of the year, but over the vegetable

--world, within the brief period of a day when we find the practical photo-

graphist stating that two hours before noon he can produce effects, which he
cannot produce two hours after the sun has crossed the meridian, it will be
clear to every one, that some accurate means of registering the relations be-
tween the amount of light and actinic (chemical) power, which are evidently
not in strict ratio to each other, is desirable.

    The instrument constructed for the Association, although not yet com-

plete, answers this purpose remarkably well. It consists essentially of a
fixed brass cylinder, about which is wound a piece of prepai-ed photographic
paper. This paper is so prepared with the bromide of silver, that it is
equally sensitive to all the rays of the prismatic spectrum. Over this is
placed another cylinder which is driven by clock-work, and it performs a
revolution in twenty-four hours. In the moveable cylinder is a triangular
slit, the largest part being exactly one hundred times the size of the smallest,
which is a mere point, and this opening is divided by bars into one hundred

parts. In passing round, the opening exposes regularly to solar influence

--different parts of the photographic paper, the smallest part of the opening

allowing the influence to be exerted for considerably less than a minute,
whilst the largest part admits of the action of the sun's rays for more than
an hour. The paper, by experiment, is so adjusted, that the greatest amount
of actinic power darkens it completely during the shortest exposure, whilst
the weak light of winter is just sufficient to produce the effect during the
passage of the longest part of the opening. The degrees between these
points become of course, under the ever-varying conditions of solar radia-
tion, unequally darkened, and the paper being carefully marked to the hours
of the day, it is quite easy to register numerically the varying effects pro-
duced. It will not therefore be necessary to have recourse to any plan of
fixing the impressions made, which is always an uncertain process. It is
hoped that by the next meeting of the Association the author v/ill be enabled
to furnish registers complete for twelve months, and he thinks he shall then
be enabled to show that the actinic influence is one which must be taken

into account in many inquiries, and to prove that the actinic or chemical
power, and the phaenomena of luminous and thermic action, are not found

in any constant ratio in the solar rays, but that they are liable to continual

variation.

On Ozone. By Professor Schonbein of Basle.

The British Association has done me the honour of inviting me to prepare
a report on my researches regarding a peculiar agent to which I have given

the name " Ozone." Flattering as such a charge must have proved to me, I

undertake its execution with great difiidence, less on account of the subject

of the report itself, than in consequence of my being obliged to make use of
an idiom which I am not in the habit of speaking. Having fully experienced

on former occasions the kindness of the same Association I have now the
honour to address, I count upon your indulgence, and am convinced that

you will receive with your wonted urbanity the very imperfect communica-
tion of a man who is certainly in one respect an alien to this country, but who

feels himself nevertheless intimately connected with your land by many ties
of friendship and scientific intercourse, and considers old hospitable England

as his second home.

Were I not actuated by such feelings, I would not have ventured to come

forward on this occasion, and it is to those feelings alone* that I owe the
courage requisite for a stranger who is to speak before an Association count-
ing amongst its members the very essence of British philosophers. In taking

the liberty to give you an account of the results obtained from researches

with which I have been occupied these last six years, I shall chiefly keep in

view the most novel facts I have been fortunate enough to ascertain, and I

Nowshall try to be as concise and clear as possible in stating them.  and

then, as the occasion occurs, I intend to enter into theoretical considerations

and draw inferences from the phaenomena observed. After having made you

fully acquainted with the subject of my report, I need not say how much you
will oblige me by making any observation or suggestion calculated to clear

up a matter which I readily allow is yet very far from being thoroughly un-

derstood and sifted to the bottom. I shall feel myself fully repaid for the

many pains I have taken these last five or six years in investigating the

nature of the electrical smell, if I happen to succeed in convincing you that

my subject is worthy of philosophical research and likely to open a new field
                 --

--92 REPORT 1845.

of inquiry. First of all permit me to state the reasons which induced me to

undertake that series of investigations, the principal results of which will form

the substance of my communication.
   The peculiar smell developed during electrical discharges and the pecu-

liar odour disengaged by lightning, have been the subject of a good deal
of conjecture ; but as far as I know, philosophers have not yet succeeded in
clearing up the nature of that smell. The obscurity in which that phae-
nomenon is enveloped, and the fact, I think first stated by myself, that on elec-
trolysing water an odour makes its appearance very like to that called the

electrical smell, excited my curiosity so much the more, that the circumstances

under which the two sorts of smells are produced are apparently so very
different from each other.

   I made up my mind to investigate the subject as closely as possible, and in

spite of its peculiar difficulty and many fruitless endeavours, 1 succeeded at
last in ascertaining some facts which seemed to open a path for further and

--accurate inquiry.
    These facts were, 1, that the odoriferous principle developed during
the electrolysis of water is only disengaged at the positive electrode ; 2,

that the same principle may be preserved in well- closed bottles for any length

of time ; 3, that this principle polarizes negatively gold and platinum ; 4, that
the odoriferous substance is destroyed by heat and a number of oxidizable
bodies ; 5, that the electrical brush has the same odour as the oxygen dis-
engaged at the positive electrode ; 6, that the brush has the power of polar-
izing negatively gold and platinum; 7, that on heating the points out of
which electricity is passing into the atmosphere, they no more develope the

electrical smell. From these and some other facts, I was inclined to infer that
the electrical brush produces the same principle which is disengaged at the
positive electrode during the electrolysis of water, and as chlorine, with regard

to its voltaic bearings, acts very similarly to this odoriferous principle, I sus-

pected the latter to be a body analogous to chlorine. To decide on the cor-
rectness of that conjecture, there seemed to be no other way left open than

to isolate the principle in question ; but considering the infinitely small
quantities in which the odoriferous substance is produced under the cir-
cumstances mentioned, the carrying into efiect that isolation assumed the

appearance of a thing lying beyond the reach of possibility. Yet after many
trials undertaken with a view of producing more abundantly and by other

than electrical means, ray peculiar principle, I succeeded at last in doing so,
and phosphorus proved to be the substance most convenient to obtain that

end. And from the discovery of the most remarkable action which that body
under certain circumstances exerts upon common air, I was led to ascertain
the whole series of the curious and rather surprising facts I am about to state,
and to arrive, if not at the complete solution of my problem, at least at the

opening of the path which will ultimately lead to that goal.

   And now I am touching upon that part of ray report which, as to its mat-
ter of fact contents, is the more interesting one of the whole of the commu-
nication I have to make to you, and I beg leave to call your attention to the

following statements :
    1. If at a temperature of 32° a piece of phosphorus, having a clear surface,

be placed in a bottle filled with common air, a peculiar smell makes its ap-

pearance which is considered to be due to the vapour of phosphorus ; at the
same time that the included air assumes the power of polarizing positively a
plate of platinum or gold which happens to be brought in contact with it.

    2. Everything remaining in the state indicated, except the temperature
being raised to about 60°, a change will very soon take place both with re-
--

gard to the smell of the air and the electro-motive power of the latter. The
former will resemble the electrical smell, and the air will now be able to po-

larize negatively gold or platinum.
   3. Atmospheric air completely deprived of its moisture and put in contact

with phosphorus, does not give rise to the production of the electro-negative

principle.

   4. Atmospheric air, which contains only small quantities of the vapours of
aether, alcohol, olefiant gas, sulphurous acid, nitrous acid, sulphuretted, phos-
phuretted or seleniuretted hydrogen, is not capable of developing the elec-
trical smell, or assuming the state of the electro-negative polarity.

  A5. mixture of oxygen and carbonic acid, or of oxygen and hydrogen,

acts with regard to phosphorus like the common air, or an artificial mixture

of oxygen and nitrogen.
    6. Pure oxygen, or nitrogen, or hydrogen, or carbonic acid gas, whether

moist or anhydrous, being placed in contact with phosphorus, becomes posi-
tively polarized ; but none of those substances produce our electro-negative

principle or the electrical smell.

   7. To generalize the circumstances under which phosphorus is prevented
from generating the said principle, it may be said that anything that stops the
slow combustion or the emission of light of phosphorus at the common tem-

perature, also renders impossible the development of the electrical smell, whilst
the latter is always produced in an atmosphere in which phosphorus exhibits
in the dark the phasnomenon of a lively emission of light.

   8. The positive polarity and alliaceous odour assumed at zero by common

air in contact with phosphorus, is most likely due to the vapour of that body,
whilst the negative polarity and the electrical smell developed at a higher
temperature in the same air, originate in that peculiar principle, which, on
account of its strong odour, I have called ozone.

   As far as my experiments go they show that ozone enjoys the following

properties :
    1. Stripes of blue litmus paper, being plunged into an ozonized atmosphere,

are within a very short time completely bleached without being reddened
in the least degree. Stripes of paper, having been coloured blue by a solu-

Ation of indigo, and placed under the same circumstances, turn white.

solution of indigo or of litmus, being shaken with an ozonized air, loses also
its colour exactly in the same way as if the solution had been treated by

chlorine.

    2. Most metals, silver even not excepted, being in a state of minute me-
chanical division and put in contact with ozone, almost instantaneously de-
stroy that principle at the common temperature. Silver being changed
under the circumstances into a compound containing nothing but metal and
oxygen, it seems that the other metals are also oxidized by ozone.

    3. Iodine put into an ozonized atmosphere is changed into iodic acid.
    4. Powder of charcoal very rapidly destroys ozone.
   5. Phosphorus quickly takes up ozone, being transformed into phosphoric

acid.

    6. Sulphuretted, seleniuretted, phosphuretted, carburetted, and ioduretted
hydrogen rapidly destroy ozone, and are themselves decomposed by that

principle.

    7. Sulphurous acid and ozone being mixed together disappear and produce

sulphuric acid.

    8. Nitrous acid and ozone destroy each other with instantaneous quick-
ness, producing nitric acid.

  A9. number of metallic protoxides being put in contact with an ozonized
--94 REPORT 1845.

atmosphere are changed into peroxides. Solutions of the alkaline bases, as
potash, soda, baryta, &c., take up rather slowly ozone, producing peroxides.
The hydrates of the protoxides of manganese, lead, cobalt, nickel, or silver,
being attached to stripes of paper and suspended in an ozonized atmosphere,
are rather rapidly changed into the peroxides of those metals. Potash takes
up ozone and water too.

  A10. solution of iodide of potassium is rapidly decomposed by being

treated with ozonized air, iodine being eliminated. At the same time iodate
of potash is produced, which production is however preceded by the forma-
tion of a peculiar compound most likely consisting of iodide and peroxide of
potassium. Hence it comes that paste of starch being mixed up with some
iodide of potassium and exposed to ozonized air, instantaneously turns blue,
and proves to be the most delicate test for ascertaining the presence of ozone.

    11. Crystals of bromide of potassium, put into paste of starch and exposed
to the action of ozone, colour that paste orange-yellow.

   A12. solution of the yellow ferro-cyanide of potassium readily takes up

ozone, yielding the red ferro-sesquicyanide.

   13. The white cyanide of iron, being exposed to the action of an ozonized
atmosphere, is instantaneously changed into the blue one.

   14. The salts of the protoxides of iron and tin rapidly destroy ozone, and

are transformed into peroxide salts.

  A15. great number of metallic sulphurets, being put in contact with ozo-

nized air, lose their colour and are changed into sulphates ; a piece of paper
having been written over with a solution of acetate of lead and blackened by
sulphuretted hydrogen, rapidly turns white within ozonized air.

  A16. number of organic substances, both of vegetable and animal origin,

being placed within ozonized air, almost instantaneously destroy the odori-
ferous principle; for instance, saw-dust, straw, ulmin, vegetable mould, albu-

men, fibrine, caseous matter, and therefore blood, milk and common cheese.

    17. If ozonized air be caused to pass through a narrow tube into the open
air, that current, of course, produces all the chemical reactions before men-
tioned ; but if part of the tube of emission is heated not quite red-hot, the
peculiar smell of the current disappears at once, and along with it all the
chemical and voltaic properties belonging to ozone. Its bleaching and po-
larizing power, its capability of decomposing iodide of potassium, &c., are

gone.

   18. Common air, being as richly as possible charged with ozone, has a smell
resembling very much that of chlorine, bromine and iodine ; but if ozone is
much diluted with common air, its smell cannot be distinguished from that

developed near points of electrical emission.

   19. If common air, strongly charged with ozone, be inhaled only in mode-

rate quantities, effects are produced similar to those caused by the respira-

tion of chlorine, i. e. coughing, and an inflammation of the mucous mem-

branes. Small animals put into richly ozonized air die very soon. I saw a
mouse, which had been placed in a large bottle filled with strongly ozonized
air, succumbing within the space of five minutes. As the quantity of the
ozone which killed the animal must have been iuuneasurably small, it appears
that this principle proves highly deleterious to the animal system.

    20. Chemically pure water, being acidulated by pure sulphuric acid or
phosphoric acid and eiectrolyzed, yields oxygen charged with the same prin-
ciple, which is produced when phosphorus acts upon common air; for that
oxygen enjoys all the properties belonging to ozone engendered by the agency
of phosphorus. To obtain ozone by voltaic means, it is necessary that the
acidulated water employed for that purpose be entirely free from any sub-
ON OZONE.                                                                95

stance having a tendency to unite with oxygen or ozone, and that besides

the temperature of the liquid to be electrolyzed be as low as possible. When

the conditions indicated are fulfilled, the disengagement of ozone taking place

at the positive electrode will last as long as the current continues to pass

through the said liquid. Hence it follows that no production of ozone will

take place if the electrodes consist of other metals than gold or platinum, or

if the liquid to be electrolyzed contains small quantities of sulphuretted

Anhydrogen, sulphurous acid, proto-sulphate of iron, gether, alcohol, &c.

aqueous solution of potash does not yield a trace of ozone, because free ozone

is taken up by that solution.
   21. The electrical brush developes, as is well known to philosophers, a

peculiar odour which cannot, as I have already mentioned, be distinguished

from that of diluted ozone, be that ozone produced by the agency of phos-

phorus or by the electrolysis of water. But the chemical and voltaic reac-

tions exhibited by the electrical brush are also quite the same as those pro-

duced either by chemical or voltaic ozone. Platinum foil being exposed

to the action of that brush assumes the state of negative polarity, a piece of

litmus paper is bleached, iodide of potassium or hydro-iodic acid decomposed,

iodine being eliminated, the ferro-cyanide of potassium transformed into the

sesqui-cyanide, the hydrate of protoxide of lead changed into the brown

peroxide, provided the substances mentioned be sufficiently long acted upon

by the electrical brush. If only small quantities of sulphurous acid, nitrous

acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, defiant gas, or vapour of aether or alcohol are

present in the air into which the electrical brush is passing, the latter does

not develope the peculiar electrical smell, neither does it produce any of the

Achemical or voltaic reactions before mentioned.  point of electrical emis-

sion being heated not quite red-hot, yields a brush which has no smell what-

soever, has no polarizing or bleaching power, does not decompose iodide of

potassium, &c. ; but as soon as the point in question is suffered to cool down

again below a certain degree of temperature, the peculiar smell reappears, and
along with it we obtain again all the reactions peculiar to ozone. From these
facts we are allowed I think to draw the inference, that the odoriferous prin-

ciple disengaged by the electrical brush is identical with the odoriferous sub-

stance which is developed at the positive electrode during the electrolysis

of water, and identical also with the electro-negative principle resulting from

a peculiar action exerted by phosphorus upon the moist atmospheric air.

In order to ascertain the nature of that remarkable principle, I have tried

a variety of methods with the view of procuring it in an isolated state, but all

ray endeavours made to that etfect have hitherto failed, and I am not yet
able to give quite a decisive answer to the question, What is ozone ?

   That principle being developed by phosphorus within a mixture of oxygen
and nitrogen, but not in pure oxygen; having in many experiments obtained

no ozone from electrolyzing water which had been boiled and deprived of its
atmospheric air; producing the same principle within the atmosphere by the

agency of common electricity; and considering the striking analogy which

exists between ozone and chlorine ; I was for a time induced to think the

former to be an elementary substance forming a constituent part of azote, and

to give up my first idea, according to which I considered ozone as a peculiar
compound consisting of oxygen and hydrogen.

   The impossibility of isolating the principle, and the fact that nothing but
oxidizing eflPects could be obtained from making ozone to act upon a great
number of substances, induced me to resume the first view I took of the
subject in question, and to institute a series of experiments with the intention

of ascertaining more accurately the conditions required for the formation of
--96 HEPORT 1845.

ozone. In that inquiry I found that the presence of water is quite indispen-
sable for engendering ozone, and that it is the more abundantly produced the

larger the quantity of water which is put into contact both with phosphorus

and common air. I likewise ascertained that no ozone is formed by phos-
phorus if free oxygen be excluded. Nitrogen may be replaced by carbonic
acid or hydrogen without stopping the generation of ozone. Hence it fol-

lows that nitrogen has directly nothing to do with the production of ozone,

and that the latter cannot be a constituent part of azote. From the fact
that dry ozone passing along a heated tube is found to be destroyed, we must

also infer that it is no elementary principle.
    Now, taking together all the facts regarding both the circumstances under

which ozone is formed and the chemical effects produced by that substance,
we can hardly help admitting that the odoriferous principle is a compound
consisting of oxygen and water. The experiments made independently of

myself by my friend, the excellent and accurate chemist of Geneva, M. Ma-
rignac, and by M. de la Rive also, have led to results quite in accordance
with the view I originally took of the nature of ozone. Marignac and De la

Rive have ascertained that acidulated water, containing not the slightest trace
either of free nitrogen or azotic matter, yields ozone as long as a voltaic
current is made to pass through that liquid, provided however it be kept as
cold as possible. M. Marignac has also found that mixtures of oxygen and hy-

drogen, or oxygen and carbonic acid gas, charged with aqueous vapour, pro-
duce ozone as well as a moist mixture of oxygen and azote. That able chemist
has further ascertained that silver in a state of minute mechanical division
readily takes up ozone, yielding nothing but a compound of silver and oxy-

gen. Agreeably to my own experiments, M. Marignac has shown that ozone

 transforms iodide of potassium into iodate of potash.

   Now these facts, combined with those ascertained by myself, seem to leave

 hardly any doubt about the nature of ozone, and confirm the view I took of it

 six years ago.

    Thenard has made us acquainted with a compound consisting of one equi-
valent of water and one of oxygen. The question now is, whether the known

peroxide of hydrogen be identical with my ozone. According to Thenard's
 own statements, peroxide of hydrogen has no odour, is soluble in water in

 any proportion, is less volatile than the latter, in decomposing itself it de-
 composes oxide of silver, i-educes the peroxide of lead to a lower degree of
 oxidation, is not affected by iron, tin, or antimony, does not oxidize silver, but
 is decomposed by that metal, undergoes a spontaneous slow decomposition

 at the common temperature, and cannot exist at the boiling-point of water.
 The experiments of Becquerel and my own have shown that platinum, on

 being plunged into dilute oxygenized water, assumes the state of positive po-

 larity. On the other hand, ozone has a strong and peculiar odour, is insolu-
 ble in water, exists, as far as we know, always in a gaseous state, readily oxi-
 dizes iron, tin, antimony, and even silver at the common temperature, changes

 the hydrates of the protoxides of lead and silver into the peroxides of those
 metals, seems not to be acted upon at all by gold or platinum, or the per-
 oxides of lead and silver, and can bear a temperature considerably higher than
 that of boiling water without suffering decomposition ; it seems to be stable

 at the common temperature, is decomposed not only by fibrine, but also by

 albumen, caseine and a variety of organic substances, and polarizes nega-

 tively gold or platinum. Now these facts seem to prove that ozone is dif-

 ferent from peroxide of hydrogen. Whether the former contains more or
 less oxygen than the latter, or whether it is an isomeric modification of oxy-
  genized water, can only be ascertained after having submitted isolated ozone
                                                     ON OZONE.                                             97

to analysis ; I am however inclined to think that ozone will turn out to be a

compound isomerical with peroxide of hydrogen, a conjecture which seems

to be supported by the fact, that the odoriferous principle acts in so many

cases the part of chlorine. On that subject however I shall speak hereafter.

As to the production of ozone, we must, as far as our experiments go, account

for it in the following manner:-- Phosphorus, being placed under certain cir-

cumstances, enjoys the peculiar faculty to determine a chemical combination

between oxygen and water. The same compound is produced in a secondary

way  on  electrolyzing  water                        part  of  the  oxygen,  being  in  a  nascent  state  and
                                                  ;

eliminated at the positive electrode, unites with water, and ozone, being inso-

luble in the latter liquid, is disengaged along with another part of oxygen

that does not combine with water. It is possible that gold or platinum

acting the part of the positive electrode may have something to do with the

fact, that not the whole quantity of oxygen set free by the action of the cur-

rent is united with water and transformed into ozone, for it may be that

ozone being in a peculiar state (for instance, in the fluid state), happens to

be decomposed by the metals mentioned just in the same way as common

peroxide of hydrogen is.

   Common electricity passing through atmospheric air acts upon that mix-

ture like phosphorus, i. e. determines part of the atmospheric oxygen to unite

with aqueous vapour to form ozone.

   Before concluding the first part of my report, allow me to say a word or
two about the well-knoM-n phcenomenon which phosphorus exhibits when
placed in moist atmospheric air. At the common temperature, and under

the circumstances mentioned, that substance gives out in the dark rather a

lively light, and is changed into a mixture of phosphoric and phosphorous

acids. In dry atmospheric air scarcely any emission of light takes place, and

Myin oxygen none at all.                             experiments have invariably shown that no ozone

is produced if phosphorus does not shine in the dark, and that the emission

of light is the more lively the more i-ichly common air or any other gaseous

mixture happens to be charged with ozone. As phosphorus, like all other

readily oxidizable substances, quickly takes up ozone at the common temper-

ature, there can be entertained hardly any doubt that the shining of phos-
phorus which takes place within moist atmospheric air chiefly depends upon

the reaction exerted by ozone on phosphorus, and that the oxidation of that
substance is eifected less by the free atmospheric oxygen than by the oxy-
gen contained in ozone. By dint of some peculiar power, phosphorus de-
termines, first, the formation of ozone out of the oxygen and aqueous

vapour of the air ; and so soon as this compound is generated, part of it be-
gins to act upon phosphorus, and change the latter into acid, whilst another
portion of ozone is dissipated into the surrounding air. If the bottle con-
taining common air and a sufficient quantity of phosphorus happen to be

completely closed, the production of ozone and its subsequent decomposition

effected by phosphorus will continue so long as there is free oxygen present

in the air ; and we find therefore, after a certain time, in the bottle nothing
but nitrogen and phosphatic acid. According to this view, the disappear-

ance of the atmospheric oxygen is not due to the direct oxidation of phos-

phorus, but to the previous formation of ozone determined by that element,

and to the subsequent decomposition likewise brought about by phosphorus.

As to the cause of the emission of light alluded to, I am quite confident that
it lies in'the ozonization of phosphorus, if I am allowed to use that expres-

sion, that is to say, in the oxidation of phosphorus being effected by the

agency of ozone.

The correctness of that explanation is put beyond a doubt, by the fact that

a number of gaseous substances being mixed witli common air, phosphorus is

prevented from shining in the dariv. Gaseous, nitrous, or sulphurous acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen, olefiant gas, liydro-iodic acid gas, vapour of aether, or

alcohol, have this effect. Now according to the results of my experiments,

all the substances mentioned instantaneously take up or destroy ozone, and
such being the case, we can easily conceive why those gases and vapours
present in the atmospheric air do not prevent phosphorus both from shining

in the dark and from being changed into phosphatic acid. No ozone is or

can be produced under those circumstances ; for if that compound did ever
happen to exist in that air, it would be instantaneously destroyed by the
agents mentioned. Any gaseous substance therefore which readily unites
with free ozone will prevent phosphorus from shining in that atmosphere,
and of course also hinder the formation of ozone. Water being an indis-
pensable ingredient for the generation of ozone, we can now easily see why
in completely dry air the shining of phosphorus is nearly imperceptible. It
is true, under these circumstances, some emission of ligVit takes place, but it
is exceeding! jf slight if compared to that exhibited in moist air. It is possible
that that feeble phosphorescence results from a very small portion of oxygen

directly uniting with phosphorus.

   As ozone, in its action upon metals and a variety of other bodies, exhibits
a very striking similarity to tiiat which chlorine exerts upon the same sub-

stances, and as the remarkable analogy existing between these two principles
extends itself even to the way of producing them, I shall take, on a future
occasion, the liberty to submit to you some considerations regarding that
subject, and bearing upon the two rival theories which have been founded

with reference to chlorine.

                 On the part which Ozone acts in the Atmosphere.

    Paste of starch, being mixed up with some chemically pure iodide of potas-
sium and exposed for some time to the action of the open air, turns blue,
whilst the same paste, shut up in a bottle filled with atmosplieric air, re-
mains colourless. Pieces of white linen, having been drenched with a so-
lution of pure iodide of potassium, and left for some time in the open air,
assume a brownish tint, which is due to iodine set free under the circum-

stances mentioned. That elimination of iodine does not, as far as my expe-

riments go, take place in air inclosed within a bottle, though that air should
contain even half its volume of carbonic acid gas. Iodide of potassium,
after having for some time been exposed to the action of the open air, re-
tains traces of a peculiar peroxide of potassium, of iodate and carbonate of
potash, whilst in iodide of potassium kept in well-closed vessels nothing of

the kind is found. From these facts it appears that the before-mentioned
elimination of iodine, and the formation both of peroxide of potassium and
iodate of potash, are not due to the action of free atmospheric oxygen nor to
that of carbonic acid. According to my former experiments, air having
been artificially ozonized, and made to pass through a solution of pure iodide
of potassium, eliminates iodine, and causes the production of the said perox-
ide, iodate and carbonate of potash. Hence it follows that ozone produces,
with the iodide of potassium, the same chemical changes as those which are
effected by the open air, and between the two actions there is a difference of

degree only and not of kind.

   Now neither free oxygen, nor azote, nor carbonic acid being able to pro-

duce that effect, we must conclude that there is something peculiar in the
atmosphere which causes the decomposition of our iodide, and has up to this
present moment escaped the attention of chemists. But of what nature is

Mythat oxidizing agent?  experiments have shown that during the electri-

cal discharges which we effect by artificial means within atmosplieric air,
ozone makes its appearance, and from that fact we are allowed, I think, to

draw the inference that ozone is also produced as often as the electrical equi-

librium of the atmosphere suffers disturbance from natural causes. Now

electrical discharges of that description continually taking place in that at-

mosphere, it follows that the odoriferous principle is continually formed there.

    This conclusion, taken together with the before-mentioned fact, that iodide

of potassium is changed by ozone exactly in the same way as it is by atmo-

spheric air, renders it highly probable, if not altogether certain, that the pe-

culiar oxidizing agent contained in our atmosphere is nothing but ozone

produced by atmospheric electricity. Starting from that supposition, it is

very easy to see why the freely circulating air only acts upon tlie iodide, and

why stagnant or inclosed air does not. The quantity of ozone contained in

a small volume of air must be exceedingly minute, and large quantities of air

are therefore required to pass over a particle of iodide in order to cause a

perceptible elimination of iodine.

If ozone is to be considered as a constituent part of our atmosphere, and

it be a well-ascertained fact that ozone is capable of oxidizing a great

number of substances at the common temperature, we can hardly help ascri-

bing to that subtle agent many slow oxidations which are effected in the

atmosphere. As electrical discharges take place not only during a thunder-

storm, but daily and hourly, and as those discharges give rise to the produc-

tion of ozone, that principle would by degrees accumulate to an alarming

amount, and so as to endanger animal life, if nature had not taken care to

remove it almost as quickly as it is formed. That removal is principally

effected by the large quantities of organic matter which cover the surface of

the earth, and which are suspended in the waters of the ocean.

   Not one single elementary body, and very few oxidizable compounds, com-
bine at the common temperature with free oxygen ; oxidizable substances must
be more or less heated in order to unite with that element. And it is a

well-known fact, that oxygen, being in certain states of combination, is able

to combine at the common temperature with a great variety of substances.

Such being the case, we must be rather surprised at the facility with which

organic substances, placed in contact with the atmosphere, are decomposed

and transformed into carbonic acid and water, and that circumstance must

strike us still more if we consider that carbon and hydrogen require high
temperatures to be united with free oxygen. On account of the facts men-

tioned, it is rather difficult to admit that it is the gaseous oxygen of the at-

mosphere which combines with the carbon and hydrogen of organic mat-

ters. According to the statements I have made, ozone has the power to de-

stroy all vegetable colours, and is taken up by a variety of organic substances.

I think there can be hardly any doubt that the reactions mentioned are due

to the oxygen of ozone being thrown upon the oxidizable constituent parts of

vegetable and animal matter, and it is therefore very likely that atmospheric

ozone acts some part in the slow decomposition which organic substances

undergo in the open air, and that atmospheric ozone has also something to

do with the common bleaching process. I however do not mean to say that

the mentioned oxidations are exclusively to be ascribed to that ozone which

is produced by the agency of atmospheric electricity.

  We know that ozone may be produced in another than electrical manner,

namely, by what the French call action de presence, or by the catalytic force

of Berzelius. Phosphorus, in its action upon moist atmospheric air, exhibits

the most interesting example of the kind, so that we may consider it as a

                                                                 h2
--100 REPORT 1845.

fundamental phsenomenon which will best serve us to develope our ideas re-
garding the course of the slow oxidations which take place in the atmosphere.

   Though phosphorus be one of the most readily oxidizable substances, it
does not, to a perceptible degree, combine at the common temperature with
the oxygen of atmospheric air, if the latter be completely deprived of its
moisture. But no sooner has aqueous vapour been added to that air, than
the oxidation of phosphorus begins, and along with it the emission of light
and the production of ozone. Of that agent Ave know that it oxidizes readily
at the common temperature even silver and iodine, and of course pliosphorus
too. Hence it appears that ozone, at the very moment of its being formed
under the catalytic influence of phosphorus, out of atmospheric oxygen and
water, reacts upon phosphorus, and causes both the formation of phosphatic
acid and the emission of light.

    Every chemist knows the fact that dry atmospheric air is not capable of
oxidizing at the common temperature even the most oxidizable metals, and
that under the same circumstances dry organic matters are not acted upon
by anhydrous atmospheric air. Hence we conclude, that besides the atmo-
spheric oxygen, water acts an important part in the slow oxidations which
both the inorganic and organic substances undergo in the open air.

   As far as I know, chemists entertain the opinion that in the cases men-

tioned water acts only a secondary part, that is to say, the part of a solvent
for oxygen. It is supposed that the gaseous state of that body weakens consi-
derably its affinity for the oxidizable substances, and it is said that the affinity

is much increased by depriving oxygen of its gaseous condition, for instance,
by dissolving that body in water.

   As long as we had not been acquainted with the remarkable action exerted
by phosphorus upon moist atmospheric air, the notions alluded to appeared

to be plausible enough, and notably the rapid acidification which phosphorus

at the common temperature undergoes in humid air could satisfactorily be
accounted for in the way mentioned. But in the present state of science Ave
can no longer keep up that vicAV, and are obliged to admit that the sIoav com-
bustion which phosphorus undergoes in damp air is principally, if not exclu-
sively due to the exalted oxidizing power of ozone engendered by the cata-
lytic force of phosphorus. Now if phosphorus enjoys the poAver of deter-

mining the atmospheric oxygen to unite with Avater into ozone, I think the
conjecture is not over-bold Avhich ascribes the same faculty to some other
oxidizable substances. In this respect shining Avood offers a very remarkable
case. It is well knoAvn that the substance mentioned exhibits the sIoav com-
bustion under circumstances very similar to those under Avhich phosphorus
undergoes the same change. Water being taken aAvay both from atmo-
spheric air and the rotten Avood, that Avood ceases to shine in the dark, and
the formation of carbonic acid is also stopped. Noav we cannot say that it is
the Avant of Avater on account of Avhich the oxidation of the Avood is prevented,
because out of the product of the sIoav combustion a protecting film is formed
x'ound the combustible matter, as might be said regarding phosphorus ; car-
bonic acid, being a gaseous substance, leaves the Avood as soon as it is produced.
It seems not unlikely that the peculiar bearing of shining Avood is due to the
same cause to Avhich phosphorus OAves its remarkable properties, and if that
conjecture is allowed to be made, Ave may go further, and admit the possibility
that the organic substances which undergo a decomposition in the open air
possess the power of producing ozone out of free oxygen and Avater, and that
it is on this account that those substances require, besides oxygen, some

water, in order to be resolved at the common temperature into carbonic acid

aiid water.

Why that power is not enjoyed by uncombined carbon or hycjrogen we

know no more than we can as yet give a good reason for the fact that

oxygen, being in a certain state of combination, is more apt to unite with

oxidizable substances than uncombined oxygen. The phosphorescence of the

sea, which never fails to strike with astonishment every man who witnesses

for the first time that beautiful phsenomenon, seems to originate in organic

matter, which in a state of minute mechanical division is mixed up with the

waters of the ocean. If I am not mistaken, one of the first-rate philoso-

phical observers of the day, Ehrenberg, takes that view of the subject. The

intensity  of  this  phospliorescence  is  not  everywhere  the  same                         in  the  tropical
                                                                                           ;

climates the phasnomenon is more brilliant than in the seas of the colder

regions. It is also well known that the phosphorescence of the sea is inti-

mately connected with the motion of its waters, or to speak more properly,

that the pheenomenon is dependent upon the particles of those waters being

brought in immediate contact with the atmosphere. When a ship moves

about, or the wind happens to agitate the sea, the surface of the brine is
continually renewed, and consequently new particles of organic matter are

every moment brought into contact with the surrounding air. As under
these circumstances the phosphorescence is always called forth, the German
philosopher has come to the conclusion that the phsenomenon mentioned is
principally due to an action exerted by the atmosphere upon the waters of
the ocean, and ingeniously enough Ehrenberg considers that phosphorescence

as the effect of a sort of respiration of the sea. If the waters of the ocean
were found to contain phosphorus dissolved, nobody would doubt in the
least that the phosphorescence in question depended upon the slow com-
bustion of that substance taking place at the surface of the sea, and we could

easily see why the motion of its waters, the temperature, &c., exert an in-

fluence upon the phaenomenon. Now as we have got in shining wood an

organic matter which, like phosphorus, undergoes the slow combustion in

moist air, and as it is not unlikely that phosphorus and shining wood act in

the same way upon atmospheric air, that is to say, that both substances pro-

duce ozone out of the oxygen and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere, it ap-

pears not improbable that there exist some other organic substances enjoying
the property of shining in the dark. The organic matter occurring in the
waters of the sea, and originating in the remains of a countless number of
animal beings which are daily dying in the depths of the ocean, may very
possibly enjoy that property, so much the more as that matter happens to be

in a state of extremely minute mechanical division.

   According to the conjecture suggested, we may consider that animal matter,

with regard to its bearing to the atmosphere, as a representative either of

phosphorus or shining wood, and we can account for the phosphorescence

of the sea in the same way as we have explained the slow combustion which

phosphorus undergoes in moist atmospheric air. Agreeably to that view,

the light given out by the waters of the ocean must be considered as the

effect of a process of oxidation taking place on a most extensive scale, which

process is carried on less by the free oxygen of the atmosphere, than by that

of the ozone which we suppose to be produced by the catalytic force of the

animal matter of the sea.

   It is possible that the glow-worm and other animals shining in the dark
generate a matter which acts upon atmospheric air in the same way as phos-

phorus does.

   It is one of the facts best known, that carbonic acid is continually pro-
duced in the animal body, and that the formation of that compound is inti-

mately connected both with the functions of respiration and the change of
102 REPORT 1845.

blood. Wherever that carbonic acid may be produced, certain it is that the

carbon required for its production comes from the body, and that the oxida-
tion of that element takes place at a temperature at which carbon, being in a
free state, does not combine with oxygen. From the large quantities of carbonic
acid produced during the respiration of an, animal, and the minute quantities
of free ozone inhaled, it appears that that carbonic acid cannot be engendered

by atmospheric ozone. May we be allowed to suppose that blood being

put in contact with atmospheric oxygen acts upon the latter as phosphorus
does upon the same oxygen ? Is it perhaps to ozone being formed in the

way alluded to that the carbonic acid breathed out owes its origin ? May
we compare, in a chemical point of view, phosphorus placed in atmospheric

air to an animal breathing in the same air? Strangely as these questions
may sound, we can hardly help putting them, after having discovered in
ozone so powerful an oxidizing agent, and found in phosphorus so remark-
able a means to produce it.

    In spite of the floods of light which recent chemical and physiological re-
searches have thrown upon the function of respiration, we are still very far
from understanding thoroughly that phaenomenon, and for that very reason

every fact which promises to unveil further that mystery is, in my opinion,

highly worthy of all the attention both of physiologists and chemical philo-

sophers. And as the subject I have treated of is such as to remind, as it

were of itself, of its possible bearings to respiration, I think it will not be left
entirely unnoticed.

     Considering the great importance of the part which the atmosphere acts
 in different departments of organic and inorganic nature, it is very desirable
that it should become more and more the subject of the most careful and ex-
 tensive researches, and that chemists in particular should direct their atten-
 tion to those phaenomena which take place in atmospheric air, or are depen-

 dent upon the latter ; for much as modern science has done in that field of

 inquiry, it cannot be denied that the greatest mysteries are yet to be unveiled
 in it. Holding the opinion that the extraordinary action which phosphorus
 exerts upon atmospheric air discloses to us a fundamental phaenomenon, I

 am inclined to believe that that action, once fully understood, will give us

 an insight into the cause of a series of phaenomena which at this present
 moment are yet enveloped in utter darkness.

            On the Influence of Friction upon Thermo-electricity.

                        By Paul Erman of Berlin.

 [A communication read to the Mathematical and Physical Section, and ordered to be printed

 Are the forces that govern the interior constitution of bodies tivo in number,

 and essentially distinct ; or do the effects usually called chemical, proceed
 from the same cause as those to which we give the appellation of mechanical ?
 The future progress of science depends on the solution of this problem, which
 the recent development of physics has brought almost entirely within the
 province of electricity. In this province, the two schools, the chemical and
 the contact of theorists, rival each other in the sagacity and energy they
 display in the defence of their tenets. Let us indicate however a strategical
 position, the importance of which the contact party do not appear to have
 sufficiently seized. Friction is merely a repeated molecular contact, so that
 the mathematical expression of its effects would perhaps only consist in higher
ON THE INFLUENCE OF FRICTION UPON THERMO-ELECTRICITY. 103

Wepowers of the quantity that expresses the effect of contact.  have known

from time immemorial that it developes heat, without understanding the

reason of its so doing ; subsequently it was found that it developes the static
electricity of isolators ; and at length Mr. Faraday has found that it modifies

equally the dynamic electricity produced by the contact of thermo-electrical

conductors. In spite of the importance of this last fact and the weight of

so great a name, it does not appear to have met with sufficient attention in

scientific circles. Some observers, who appeal to the authority of iVTr. Em-

met, express what they consider to be the law of this action, by saying that

thermo-electricity of contact is changed invariably into the opposite state by

the friction of the two metallic factors. Others, on the contrary, deny in

toto the influence of friction on thermo-electric phsenomena. Thus it was

recently adverted to in a scientific journal as a highly paradoxical fact, that

in a given case the friction had caused a change of sign in the thermo-elec-

tric declination produced by the contact of two heterogeneous metals ; but

at the same time this " unheard-of" fact, as it was called, was explained by

supposing gratuitously that the friction had been effected whilst keeping the

metal to be rubbed in the naked hand, and in thus producing an accidental

change of temperature. This explanation was offered on the assumption

that friction in itself is not capable of producing any effect. Between the

two extremes of tribothermo-electric omnipotence and nullity, I have tried to

discover the middle course of truth. If I am bold enough to call your atten-

tion to some of the preliminary results of these labours, it is solely with a

view of contributing to the more general discussion of this question, and
with the hope of some observers joining me in these researches, and con-

trolling, rectifying, and extending my experiments.

For the experiments now to be mentioned, one of Nobili's thermo-electric

multiplicators of particularly delicate structure is requisite. Being furnished

Awith an instrument of this kind, I proceeded in the following manner.

bar of bismuth was joined to that branch of the rheophore of this instru-

ment where the silver of a voltaic element (silver and zinc) produces an

eastern deviation, and a bar of antimony to the other branch of the rheo-

phore. Both these bars were provided with handles, so that they could be

employed without undergoing any change of temperature in the manipu-

lation. When, through these being stationed in the same room, the two bars

had previously arrived at the temperature of the surrounding space, no de-

viation whatsoever was produced by their contact, but the slightest friction

of either of them against the other gave immediately an eastern deviation.

This latter extended even to an entire revolution of the needle in the same

sense if the friction proceeded rather more rapidly. By gently raising the

common temperature of the two bars to 30° or 35° of lleaum. scale, their

contact in a state of repose always produced a stationary eastern deviation of

about 30°, which by rubbing was further increased to 60°, and there likewise

remained invariable as long as friction continued. At length, when I cooled

the bars (below the temperature of the room) by the evaporation of naphtha

vitrioli, their contact continually produced a western deviation, which by rub-

bing was instantaneously changed into a contrary or eastei-n one of apparently

the same amount as before, and this likewise remained stationary as long as

the friction continued, but by the interruption of it the western deviation was

immediately restored. This simple sketch of the phaenomena of changes of

intensity or even of sign, which friction at the point of contact gives to the

deviation of a multiplicators needle, will already suffice to exhibit it as a mere

consequence of the heat produced by the action of rubbing. Indeed, by

joining to the point of contact of the two metals a button somewhat warmed
--104 REPORT 1845.

or cooled (in comparison with the surrounding space), the influence on de-
viation was just as the above-mentioned effects of friction might lead us to

expect. I was confirmed in this position by operating on many groups or
combinations of the substances which form the thermo-electric series. Thus,
for instance, the sulphuret of molybdenum, which when joined to bismuth
gives no deviation by difference of temperature, appeared likewise with-
out any influence when rubbed on the same metal. The sulphuret of lead
(galena), which alone in the whole series makes bismuth negative by heat,
renders it also negative by friction. Omitting for the present some very
interesting details, which I reserve for a monograph of tribothermic elec-

tricity, it seems evident, therefore, that in these experiments the metallic
conductors of electricity are thoroughly devoid of such specific or direct
faculty of producing positive or negative electrodynamic actions, as the iso-
lating substances possess for producing electrostatic efl'ects ; if you should not
incline, with some of our philosophers, to regard even the electricity pro-
duced by friction of isolators as but a modification of heat. But postponing
this question, let us see in what manner the theory, and perhaps even the

practical application of electricity, may be promoted by the researches on
tribothermic electrization. For this purpose we must enter into some further

--details: 1. The tribothermical effect is an instantaneous one. Indeed, at

the very beginning of friction of any intensity, the needle moves. There
is no trace whatever of the retardation undergone by heat when spreading
through the mass of any substance. 2. The tribothermic effect is likewise in-
dependent of the masses put in action. The point of a needle rubbed against
a considerable heterogeneous mass, gives immediately the deviation ; and an
increase of extent of the surfaces in friction does not appear even to add
materially to the intensity of electrization. 3. The deviation vanishes quite as
instantaneously as it commenced, and the immediate return of the needle to
its primitive station is even one of the most striking features of the phseno-
meuon. These three facts are very instructive, and seem by far more likely
to be effected by a vibratory motion of molecules, than by the continuous
efflux of a calorific fluid. Indeed, if we suppose any mass imbued with a
given quantity of heat, and producing, when brought into contact with the
other elements of a couple, a certain deviation proportionable to this quan-
tity ; the slightest increase of deviation would then require a considerable
addition of heat, and, such addition taking place, the deviation could but
augment very slowly, while, on the contrary, we find by experiment that the
slightest friction produces a strong deviation. Moreover, supposing once
more that the very quantity of heat, represented by the temperature and by
the mass of the whole body, were the efficient cause of the deviation, the in-
crease of deviation produced should be durable, while by experiment we
always see it instantaneously vanish when friction ceases, just as should be the
case were it produced solely by a molecular action of the rubbing-points. In
the event of the refrigerated metal giving a western deviation, Avhich a nio-
mentaneous friction inverts into an eastern one, but only as long as the fric-
tion lasts, the result is still more paradoxical, and we have probably no other
explanation of it, but by admitting a specific difference between the mode
of production of heat in this case on the one hand, and in that of heat per-
manently residing in the body on the other. The type of molecular vibra-
tions will once more, and very naturally, be recalled by this remarkable fact.
4. The tribothermic deviations attain in every case a maximum, which under
similar circumstances is different for different couples of metals. Indeed the
friction produces, while it exists, new increments of heat which must give rise
to increments of deviation. These latter however become more and moi'e
ON THE INFLUENCE OF FRICTION UPON THERMO-ELECTRICITY. 105

insensible, and at length seem only active in causing the persistence of the

maximum of deviation. I found the values of the maxima for different

couples just in the same proportion as their thermo-electric effects.

   The four above-mentioned facts require an assiduous inquiry, supported
by numeric determinations. The quantity of permanent heat, which by a

friction of given duration accumulates in the metals, should be measured,
and it must be ascertained whether this residue is equal in each of them ; in

other words, whether at the end of a continued friction the needle returns

precisely to its primitive position, or only approaches to it ; and, if an excess

of temperature is denoted, in which of the two metals it has taken place.

Any one who knows tlie difficulty of managing such delicate instruments,
will understand why, after innumerable essays, I am not yet able to give a

categorical answer to these questions.

After a friction somewhat prolonged the needle does not return imme-

diately to its original position, but the difference is very trifling, and some-

times doubtful or ambiguous. Whenever, by a very efficacious friction, I

had carried the deviation to a maximum of 60°, the needle, on the friction

ceasing, underwent a vibration of six or eight degrees, but as the slowness of

these oscillations enabled the temperature to become equal for the two bars,

the first position of equilibrium remained ambiguous. In one apparatus a

disc of bismuth was uniformly rubbed during twenty minutes on a disc of

antimony. When the friction ceased, I immediately inserted between the

two metals a highly susceptible thermopile, and it appeared by this process

that antimony was constantly the most heated. Nevertheless, I regard this

point as not yet fully proved.

   In excusing the defectiveness of my results by the arduous nature of the
observations required, I consider it my duty to indicate to the philosophers

who would co-operate in the eminently important tribothermical researches, a

circumstance which most decidedly conti*ibutes to their difficulty. The metals

to be examined must be joined to the multiplicator by rheophoric wires, and

these are mostly heterogeneous to the metals, as bismuth, antimony and cobalt

cannot yet be wiredrawn by any known process. In employing wires of cop-
per, of platinum, or of nickel, we might hope that their specific action on the

thermo-electrical elements could be neglected, and that therefore the observed

deviation might be assumed to result only from the temperature, or from the

Afriction of the thermo-electric couple. course of rather tedious experiments

has shown me that this supposition is most erroneous and utterly deceptive,

Awhen applied to refined investigations and highly susceptible instruments.

multitude of contradictory and incoherent facts accumulated themselves like

a chaos, before I arrived at the source of error. Thus, when I broke a bar of

chemically pure antimony in the middle, and I'ubbed against each other

the once contiguous surfaces of these two parts, I obtained very sensible

deviations, but sometimes positive and sometimes negative. It was the same

with the bismuth when similarly treated. It appeared at length that these

strange results were merely owing to the action of the thermo-electric metals

on their heterogeneous rheophores, for two copper elements with copper

rheophores, and two zinc elements with rheophores of zinc, never give the

slightest trace of tribothermo-electric effect, whilst any of these two metals

produces a strong deviation, when after friction it is singly applied to the

Abutton of the multiplicator.  voluminous journal of attempts to decide the

questions treated in the former part of this paper was nullified by the unex-

from a piece of pure graphite, between the thermo-electric agent and its

rheophore. The graphite acts but very feebly by its contact with heteroge-

neous substances, and at the same time proves an excellent conductor for

electricity excited in any other manner. It is desirable that other means may

be found to obviate the impediments resulting from the extreme sensibility of

the apparatus which must be necessarily employed, as a minute absolute in-

tensity is a characteristic feature of all tribo-electric actions, and can alone

explain the reason of their having been so long either unnoticed or errone-

ously estimated. When, by immersion in a vessel of warm water, the tempe-

rature of a bar of bismuth and of another of antimony is elevated to upwards

of 45° R., they will give by this contact a very strong eastward deviation, but
the friction will not cause it to increase any more in a sensible degree. When,

on the contrary, the same two bars are greatly refrigerated by being plunged

in triturated ice, tiieir contact gives a strong negative or western deviation, but

the friction in this case, far from inverting this effect, is not even able to di-

minish it in any material degree. The calorific increments produced by fric-

tion are in themselves very feeble ; the tribothermic multiplicator acts, in

respect to them, as a microscopic apparatus ; but the fact that its indications

are circumscribed within certain limits, and becomes insensible when these

Welimits are passed, is of striking importance.                                                                need only to ascertain by

very careful experiments the degrees of heat and of refrigeration given to the

metals, by which their friction loses its influence on the needle, in order to

obtain for a scale of tribothermic production of heat, two fixed points which

can be reproduced in any instance, in exactly the same manner as the fixed

terms of our ordinary thermometer. The philosophers who may apply them-

selves to tribothermic experiments, will not fail to meet with the paradox of two

electric currents acting simultaneously in contrary directions. In the frequent

cases where the contact produces a deviation of the needle in a certain sense

and the friction in the contrary one, we can so modify these actions that the

needle remains in equilibrium in an intermediate position, obeying the two
currents that travel along the same wire in contrary directions. As to the

obscure question of the relation between the direction in which the heat moves,

according to the received terminology of the thermo-electric phaenomena, and

the direction in which electricity proceeds, it is not impossible, although
highly improbable, that tribothermo-electric researches may throw some

light upon it. The following Table presents the state of this question :

   The friction increases the eastern deviations and changes all the western
into eastern ones, that is to say, that bismuth becomes equally positive by an
increase or a diminution of heat. May it be inferred that heat when nascent
by the act of friction has a property specifically different from that of heat
residing previously in a metal ? Are we perhaps on the eve of finding at

length something analogous to the brilliant discovery of Peltier, that gal-

vanic electricity produces heat in proceeding from antimony to bismuth,
ON THE INFLUENCE OF FRICTION UPON THERMO-ELECTRICITY. 107

and cold when travelling inversely, by which M. Lenz has produced conge-

lation ?

   The electric telegraph is becoming popular at present, but it generally re-
quires an apparatus which is variable in its effects and expensive in its employ-
ment. It would therefore be advantageous to substitute the purely mecha-
nical principle of the tribothermic telegraph. For by removing the stopper
of a wheel-work, a disc of bismuth rubs against another of antimony, and
at the same instant the needle at the opposite extreme of the rheophore is

put in motion. I have ascertained the instantaneousness of this operation for
tolerably considerable distances. Employed as a signal, it would have the
advantage, that after the interval of some days or months, when the clockwork
is put in motion, the effect of friction would take place, whereas in tiie vol-
taic telegraph there would be a chance of the combination having lost its
efficacy by the lapse of time.

-- AP.S. Berlin, August.  highly competent judge (Mr. Grove) being of

opinion that I have imperfectly explained the grounds for my suspicion of a

possible analogy between certain effects of the heat which is generated in the

act of friction and the discovery of M. Peltier, I regret that in my paper I have

affected a form too strictly aphoristic. I shall endeavour to remedy this by

selecting, among many others, one tribothermo-electric fact, whose very para-
doxical character first induced me to suppose such an analogy. Let a crystal

of sulphuret of lead (galena) be placed at one of the poles of the multiplier,

and at the other pole (to be alternately placed in action) of the rheophore a

bar of bismuth and a bar of antimony ; the bismuth being rubbed against the

crystal, takes immediately a negative electric charge. This exception was

already known for the same metal heated. From all the analogies hitherto

known, it results that antimony being rubbed in the same way should become

positive, and that to obtain by it a negative declination of the magnetic needle,

it ought to be refrigerated. Now I find by experiment that the friction of

antimony against a crystal of galena gives absolutely the same declination as

the bismuth : in fact, the direction, the intensity and the quickness of the

effect, are in the two cases sensibly equal ; and we cannot deny that in this

very paradoxical case, it appears that an increment of nascent heat produces

in the antimony the effect of cooling. The singular effects which are ob-
served when uncrystallized masses of sulphuret of lead are substituted for the

single crystal of galena, confirm the supposition that the effects of friction

depend on molecular movements. I am anxious that more practised observers
may succeed in obtaining tribothermical effects by simple internal vibration

of elastic sound-plates. I have not yet succeeded in this. But the great

prize in this race of discovery would fall to him who should discover a dif-

ference of thermo-electric action, according as a magnetically polarized bar

should be rubbed (that is, molecularly heated) at the one or the other of

its poles.

The magnet-stone and the magnetic sulphuret of iron, exert, when rubbed,

a strong thermo-electric action. I have employed these substances, as well

as magnetic steel bars, in this curious investigation, but hitherto without

success.

On the Self-registering Meteorological Instruments employed in the
    Observatory at Senftenberg. By the Baron Senftenberg.

[A commuuication read to the Mathematical and Physical Section, and ox4ered to be printed
                                             entire among the Reports.]

If any branch of natural philosophy can derive advantage from comparison

of observations made at different localities, this is particularly the case with

meteorology. Isolated observations made at one and the same spot may

furnish valuable data ; but the ultimate benefit that can by them accrue to

science, however carefully they be made, is only obtained by their combina-

tion with corresponding ones, made at more or less remote stations on our

globe, thus establishing a first basis, succeeded by others, to form the links

of that chain of arguments which may lead to the discovery of the primary

causes of atmospheric changes.

It is by this process that Me have already been enabled to ascertain that me-

teorological phsenomena are but the M'heels of that great mechanism, whereof

change of temperature is the motive power, whence the greater commotions

extending over vast regions, as well as also minor local alterations, can be traced.

Although the results of phaenomena included in the first class are in general

of higher importance than those in the second, these latter ones are not the less

deserving of minute attention, for the purpose of arriving at a just perception

of the process that takes place in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and are

even indispensable for ascertaining the effect of local causes, from which each

single observation must first be cleared before it can be made use of in com-

parison with others made possibly under different influences. For this pur-

pose observations made at two observatories at no great distance, but in other

respects very differently situated, whereof the one is in a valley, the other on

a mountain, or the one on an island surrounded by a great extent of water,

the other on an extended level sandy plain, may lead to important results

and such have indeed already been derived from comparative observations

made at Geneva and at the Hospice on the St. Bernard. The success to be

derived from such observations depends, however, mainly on their regularity

and multiplicity at both stations at stated intervals ; for phaenomena arising

from local causes are generally of short dumlion, and would escape the notice

of an observer who makes but two or three observations in the course of

a day, and of others he would have seen but the beginning or the end,

which would furnish but imperfect data for comparison. It is on this account

tiiat self-registe)-ing instruments, regularly compared with the usual ones,

afford great advantages, as no phaenomenon, of however transient a duration,

can occur without being registered by them. Such instruments have for

nearly two years been in use at the Senftenberg Observatory, and the proofs

of what can be accomplished by them are detailed in vol. v. of the Magnetic

and Meteorological Observations at Prague, which contain, however, only

those made with the barometrograph. More recently thermo- and hygrome-

trographs have also been in active use there. Of course such instruments

are complicated in their construction, and require practice in their manage-

ment, whence the first series of observations are not so regular as those made

with the usual ones, nor are the specimens now produced* intended to fur-

nish the foundation for establishing new data or hypotheses ; they are only

intended as specimens to show what results might be obtained by these means

Aunder more favourable circumstances.  detailed description of these in-

struments is contained in the third and fourth volume of the Magnetic and

   * Consisting of a selected series of tables, and diagrams of observations recorded contem-
poraneously at Prague and Senftenberg.

Meteorological Observations made at Prague ; it is therefore deemed suffi-
cient now only to state that they register from five to five minutes the va-
riations of pressure, temperature and moisture of the atmosphere. The
appended numerical Tables contain the hourly variations, and are of course
only extracts made from the original curves marked from five to five minutes
by the autograph, which was deemed sufficient for ascertaining the numerical
value of any point of the curve. The series now submitted to observation
is selected from and confined to days when considerable atmospheric changes
occurred, so as to afford a proof of the advantage to be derived by em-
ploying such instruments. On other days, where the variations are more
confined to the ordinary rates, fewer observations and at greater intervals are
sufficient to make these apparent, as on such days the differences in variation
at less distant places are so insignificant that they become scarcely percepti-
ble ; no doubt however the medium of extended regular observations would
afford the means to appreciate such, but for the present and first attempt and
trial, days when the atmosphere was more agitated seem better suited for
the proposed purpose. [Table II. contains the Observations for the 18-1 9th

June as an example.]

 --The two stations where these observations were made are, 1. Senftenberg,

which is nearly due east 100 English miles from Prague, a distance quite
sufficient to produce variations in these phsenomena, which are however in-
creased by other local causes. The observatory there is situated on the
centre of the property on the river Adler, 1281 Paris feet above the level of
the sea, in latitude 50° 5' 8"-8, and longitude, east of Greenwich, 1^ 5' 46"-98.
Its immediate site is on lias and mica slate, but at no great distance it is more
or less surrounded by higher ground with granite, gneiss and old red sand-
stone, and considerable forests\ 2. Prague, situated in a more level country,
and the river Moldau flowing through the town with a breadth of about 200

fathoms, is only 524 Paris feet above the level of the sea, without much
woodland in its neighbourhood, the lower strata of the surrounding hills

--being principally lias, sandstone and argillaceous schist, all circumstances

which may produce influence on the atmospheric variations.

    After these preliminary remarks, a little attention to the curves described
by both barometrographs will soon convince us that they run nearly parallel,
and that it is more particularly the deviation from parallelism which should

be more nearly examined. The pressure of the air at Prague being 0'9
inch greater than at Senftenberg, and the curve of Prague being the lower
one, their approach towards each other when the curves are rising proves
that the rising commenced earlier at Prague than at Senftenberg ; whereas
an approach when the curves are descending denotes a quicker diminution

of the pressure at Senftenberg. This is applicable to the extreme bends, or

those points of the curve where a maximum in either sense has taken place,
where the rising passes into falling, or the reverse ; and in those cases when

a curve that was before running nearly in a horizontal direction gradually
begins to rise or fall ; but if two curves continue for a while both to rise or
to fall, a gradual convergency or divergency must also be accounted for by
the weight of the atmosphere undergoing a change of the same nature at
both places, but a greater one in the one than the other. Variations, how-

ever, observed during a longer period, embracing a succession of days, are
generally so nearly of the same value at both stations, that by present expe-
rience no decided opinion can be expressed in which of them the total

amount of change is greatest.
    The annexed Table shows the amount of barometric variation during forty-

five days, by which it appears that the medium at Prague was only 0'005 inch
                                                                                     ;

110 REPORT 1845.

greater than at Senftenberg, a difference so small that no conclusion can by-

it be arrived at to determine at whicli of the two stations it was greater.

   It may thus be concluded that the deviation of the curves from parallelism
is produced by tlie difference in time at which the maximum and minimum

took place at the two stations. By a closer inspection of the curves, it ap-

pears that when they are either approaching to or receding from each other,

this is produced by a minimum which has taken place sooner at Prague than

Senftenberg. Thus tiie first curve on the 18th and 19th of June at Prague

shows a minimum between the hours nineteen and twenty, whilst in the

Senftenberg curve it is not perceptible till the hours of twenty-two to twenty-

three. This fact becomes still more conspicuous on other days, for on the

24th and 25th of August, where a minimum occurs in Prague at 4 o'clock,

and at Senftenberg only at 10 o'clock, on the 29th and 30th of September we

find the minimum at Prague already at the eleventh hour, which was only

reaehed at Senftenberg on the nineteenth hour. Further, Oct. 3 and 4,

minimum at Prague at the fifteenth hour, at Senftenberg at the sixteenth

hour ; Oct. 7 and 8, minimum at Prague at the second hour, at Senftenberg

at the fifth hour ; Nov. 8 and 9, minimum at Prague at the seventeenth hour

forty-five minutes, at Senftenberg at the nineteenth hour; Nov. 13 and 14,

minimum at Prague at the twelfth hour, at Senftenberg at the thirteenth

hour; and Nov. 15 and 16, minimum at Prague at the sixteenth hour, at

Senftenberg at the twenty-second hour. [The curves for the 18-19th June,

24-25th June, and 25th-26th June, are given in Plate II. as examples.]

These facts have recurred so regularly, that although the number of ob-

servations is not great, the law may be established between the above-named

two places of observation with a degree of certainty the more to be relied on,
as it invariably takes place whatever the direction of the wind may be. It

thus follows that it has its origin in the higher regions, and is independent of

Alocal influences.  change in the opposite direction, that is, a transition from

rising to falling, does not appear greatly to affect the parallelism of tlie curves

at all events no decisive proofs to that effect can be traced from the maxima

of Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 , Oct. 3 and 4, Oct. 4 and 5, Oct. 6 and 7, Oct. 7 and 8,

Oct. 14 and 15, and Nov. 15 ^nd 16.

But it is not only the minima terminating a long-continued decrease of a

curve that follow the above-mentioned law, but also disturbances that hitherto

have been considered as proceeding from local causes, such as transient gales

of wind, thunder-storms, sudden changes of temperature and moisture, all

which are indicated earlier at Prague than at Senftenberg by the autographs.

It must however be owned, that the number of such cases hitherto observed

is too small to draw certain inferences from. As an instance, the barome-

tric curve at Prague on the 24th and 25th of June shows between the hours

twenty and twenty-one a sudden transitory increase of pressure of the air, oc-

casioned by a storm which came from the west-north-w^est wheeling round to a

breeze from the east-north-east. The barometer at Senftenberg did not begin

to rise before the twenty-first hour and thirty minutes, and continued to do

so till the twenty-third hour, the wind at east-south-east. On the following

day both places were visited by thunder-storms, which greatly affected the

state of the barometer, causing it alternately to rise and fall. At Prague

the first indications in the curve were perceptible at 7 o'clock, and the undu-

lations extended to 10 o'clock. The phenomenon occupied the southern part

of the hemisphere, the wind at south-west. In Senftenberg the thunder-

storm lasted from 9 till 11, and at 9 o'clock the wind was north-west. On

the 27th of June the thermometrograph at Prague indicated a rapid decrease

of temperature between 3 and 4 o'clock, which was also perceived at Senf-
     ON SELF-REGISTERING METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS. Ill

tenberg between 4> and 5 o'clock, and this falling lasted for one hour and
twenty minutes. The beginning of this phasnomenon was marked so pre-
cisely by the autographs, that no uncertainty greater than five minutes could
have occurred.

   These first trials are only intended as examples to show the method of
using such instruments with the view of furnishing dates for the advancement
of science. The proposed object to be effected by the hourly observations
for thirty-six successive hours, at a fixed time, may by such instruments be
more readily and minutely attained. It is hardly to be expected that the
phsenoraena suited for such studies should exactly occur on such days as
have been previously selected, whilst by the assistance of such instruments
they cannot fail to be registered at all times and whenever they may occur.

   The example here furnished may suffice as a first attempt to show in what
manner such an apparatus may be applied for the promotion of science by
multiplying the materials fit to be studied. If they should be deemed of too

voluminous a nature, the consideration should not be lost sight of, that such
studies have never suffered from too great a multiplicity of useful data, but
frequently from the contrary cause.

                       Section I.

       Rise of the Barometer above 30 inches.

In Table IV. of the abstracts of the results of meteorological observations

made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, 1840 and 1841, Mr. Airy has
shown that in every month the barometer rose above 30 inches. The same
result is shown in Table V. of the abstracts for 1842. The observations made

at the Colonial Observatory at Toronto indicate the same general fact ; in
every month during 1841 and 1842 the barometer rose above 29"750. The

altitudes, when reduced to the level of the sea, agree with those at Greenwich,

showing a rise on both sides of the Atlantic above 30 inches in every month.
When, however, the dates of the maxima at the two stations are compared,

we find in almost all instances considerable difference, that is, the absolute

maxima at both stations are generally several days' interval from each other.
On turning to the daily records of barometric pressure at both stations, we

find maxima occurring at but few days' interval from each other, so that cor-

responding to the greatest altitude for the month at one, we obtain shortly

before or after a maximum at the other. This leads us to a fact of a very

interesting nature, and one that is generally borne out by the Greenwich ob-

servations, namely, that twice in each month the barometer passes a maximum

above, or but very slightly depressed below 30 inches, but more usually above.

   Upon subjecting the Toronto observations to a closer scrutiny and clearing
them from every extraneous influence, so that the pure gaseous pressure may

alone be contemplated, the rise to this gauge-point (30 inches, or with the

tension of the aqueous vapour deducted 29*900) is much more frequent, and

there are but few exceptions to the general fact, that the pressures at the

epochs of maxima are confined to small excursions, seldom amounting to '1

--inch above or below the mean 30'030, including those observations that
--are evidently of an extraordinary character 29*983, excluding them and the

lower readings marked (f ) in the following Table, which includes all such
maxima observed at Toronto during the period of the regular flowing of the

waves at Greenwich, hereafter to be noticed. The observations, as recorded

in the volume of Toronto observations, have been reduced to the level of the

sea ; the tension of aqueous vapour has been subtracted in each case, and the
gaseous pressures resulting have been corrected for the diurnal and annual

oscillations as determined from the two years' observations. During the pe-

riod embraced by the table at the station Toronto, the gaseous pressure

appears to have passed a maximum about or not far removed from the 3rd

of each month, and another about the 16th or 17th ; intermediate maxima,

about the 10th and 27th, have also been observed, but with less regularity.

From observations made during so short a period at only one station it would

be premature to draw any conclusions. It however appears very desirable that

some approximation to the Canadian normal wave should be attempted, by

combining the observations in a manner somewhat similar to that which I

have adopted with regard to the great November wave (see the second

part of this report).

   The passages of maxima about or not far removed from the 3rd of each
montn, appears to have failed at Greenwich for April and May. On turning,
however, to the Greenwich records we find maxima within 12 hours of the
epochs at Toronto of the following values, when corrected for sea level. April
2, 14? hours, 29-815 ; May 3, 4 hours, 29-851. It consequently appears that the
two series so I'ar agree in the general fact, that about the 3rd of each month
for the period included in the tables, the barometer passed maxima on both
sides of the Atlantic, the excursions above or below the gauge-point at Green-
wich being much greater than those at Toronto.

   Upon a still closer comparison of the maxima at both stations, it appears

highly probable that, with few exceptions, they are nearly contemporaneous,
the excursions at Greenwich being, as just noticed, by far the greatest. It
is a matter of regret that at present this most interesting subject cannot be

followed out in all its details, and that the announcement cannot extend much

beyond the high probability that during nearly eight months of the year 1841
the barometric movements on both sides of the Atlantic (Toronto and Green-
wich being at present the extreme stations) were connected, in so far as the
observations indicate a tendency to increased pressure at both stations at
nearly the same epochs, and that these epochs appear to observe some regu-
larity, exhibiting a periodicity of about 30 days' interval, especially that of

maximum pressure, about the 3rd of each month, which is clearly traced at
both stations. The greater excursions at Greenwich, the insular station, are

perfectly in accordance with facts of a similar character developed in the
course of the reduction of meteorological observations (see Sir John Her-
schel's Report in the volume for 1843).

  A comparison of the Table of Barometric Maxima in the Greenwich Abs-

tracts, with a similar table in the 15th volume of the Memoirs of the Royal
Academy of Brussels, p. 17, leads to the same result as that obtained from
a comparison of the Greenwich and Toronto observations, in so far as the
absolute maxima at both stations, Greenwich and Brussels, are not in all
cases contemporaneous, or separated only by a short interval. The table
alluded to gives only one maximum in the month, the highest reading. In
the Greenwich records we find corresponding maxima to these, with short
intervals between the transits at each station. From a consideration of the
two series of maxima the following Table has been formed.

--IIG REPORT 1845.

   The barometric curve accompanying the Greenwich observations for 1840
and 184<1, exhibits a considerable interval between the minima of January and
February in the latter year ; tliis interval is 36 days, and may be advantage-
ously compared with a long interval between the maxima of September 19
and October 21, of 31 days 16 hours. This long interval is remarkable for a
considerable and symmetrical depression of the barometer, nearly midway
between the two maxima, namely from October 5, 22 hours 57 minutes to 23
houi-s 65 minutes ; the reading uncorrected for sea level was 28'697. If we
consider the point equally distant from the January and February minima to
be the summit of a normal wave, we shall have the epoch of its transit January
28 : 18 : now the period from this apex to the depression in October will equal
250 days. The middle point of this period falls on the 2nd of June ; on the
3rd of June, 22 hours, the barometer passed a maximum. On each side of
this maximum are 6 maxima with a mean interval of 14 days 1 hour. It is
interesting to observe, that the minimum of the 16th of February, and that
of the 5th of October, are the boundaries of the period of least range ; mean
range for the seven months 1*029. Upon the hypothesis that the maxima were

the crests of waves, it appears that during the period of least range sixteen

waves traversed England, having a mean interval between their crests of 14
days 5 hours. The column of intervals clearly exhibits a considerable regu-

larity in the succession of these waves, as well as their symmetrical position
relative to the axis, and their altitudes support the same idea. Taking the

middle wave June 3 : 22, we find corresponding altitudes on either side ; thus
the highest wave passed Greenwich on March 10 : 22, altitude 30'572. Six
waves on the other side of the axis, we also have the highest reading, namely
August 26 : 10, altitude 30"S53. The following Table places this regularity
both as respects altitudes and intervals in a clearer light.

 of the barometer on a large scale, of a somewhat similar character to that of
 the great November wave. The oscillations on each side the central maximum
 June 3 : 22 have evidently a symmetrical relation, and are to be distinguished
 from the monthly maxima before alluded to. It is highly probable that a
 further examination of the Toronto observations will furnish us with the Ca-
 nadian type of atmospheric waves, in the same manner as Sir John Herschel
 found various continental types, and that in some localities (Hanover for in-
stance) the barometric curves were exceedingly anomalous, arising most pro-
 bably from an interference of different systems of waves. It is also pro-
 bable that a further examination of the Greenwich observations relative to
the monthly maxima will develope the corresponding British type, and that
an investigation of the greater symmetrical movements will conduct us to
phaenomena of a highly interesting character.

                                             Directions of Waves,

    The apparent regularity of the flowing of these waves, has induced the
hope that by a more detailed examination of the transits of the maxima at
distant stations, a tolerable idea may be formed of the direction in which
they move, and thus a step may be gained in ascending to their causes. If
we take Greenwich, Prague and Munich, as three stations, the order of transit
will vary, as the direction of the axis of translation of each wave varies.
The following appear to be some of the phaenomena presented by waves mo-

ving in different directions.

  --I. Waves from W.N.W., or nearly so. The crests will first pass Green-

wich, and at a considerable period after they will pass Munich and Prague
these stations they will pass about the same time ; Munich and Prague will
therefore have simultaneous maxima.

  --II. Waves from S.W. The crests will pass the stations in the following
--order : Greenwich, Munich, Prague.

   III. Waves from S.S.W. The crests will pass Greenwich and Munich

--simultaneously, and afterwards Prague.
   IV. Waves from S. by W. The crests pass the stations in the following

--order : Munich, Greenwich, Prague.
   V. Waves from S. The crests will pass the stations nearly at the same

--time.
   VI. Waves from S.S.E The crests pass the stations in the following or-
der: Munich, Prague, Greenwich.

   The fact that numerous systems of waves traverse Europe at the same time
renders it very difficult to determine the intervals between the transits of two
successive maxima of the same system ; the only mode appears to be, to ar-
range all the maxima and minima, and to classify and examine those that are
moving in the same direction and that transit the stations under the same

circumstances.

   Table V. exhibits the maxima and minima that passed Munich between
the transits of two minima, which apparently marked the passage of the an-
terior and posterior troughs of a normal wave ; the altitudes are converted
into English inches and reduced to the level of the sea.

   During this period we find three maxima from the S.S.W. ; the intervals
between them are nearly equal ; the first 104< hours, and the second 97 hours.
The middle wave is the highest, 30'667 ; those on each side are nearly of the
same altitude SO'SO^ and 30-275 ; the central wave is the highest of the series,
M'hich opens with a small wave from W.N.W. Table VI. exhibits the features

of this wave.

on the 10th and 24th, with an interval of fourteen days; the semi-interval would
give the included minimum on the 17th. Upon the assumption that the crest
of the normal wave passed the stations on the 24th, the preceding crest having
passed on the 10th, we have the normal trough passing on the 17th: the
numbers in Table V. appear to indicate a gradual rise and fall preceding and
succeeding the highest reading of the 24th, such as might be expected from
the transit of a large wave, the anterior and posterior slopes being indented
and masked by the transits of smaller waves flowing in various directions. The
numbers and directions in the table convey the idea of a certain regularity
in the flowing of these secondary and superposed waves. During the transit
of the normal wave three systems of waves appear to have traversed the area
included by the stations, from W.N.W., S.W. and S.S.W. The crests of the
latter system (3 waves) were only observed, but the intervals being so nearly
equal, induces the opinion that they succeeded each other with great regularity,
and were accompanied with troughs, although those troughs were masked and
concealed by the other systems. It is also probable that the altitudes of these
waves were nearly equal, the apex of the central wave being elevated by that

of the normal. The W.N.W. system appears to have been a system the

waves of which were increasing in size ; the altitudes do not appear to have
been sufficiently high to have occasioned them to ride above the upper por-
tion of the normal wave. The waves of the S.W. system were rather larger

than the earliest W.N.W. wave.
   If we consider the low readings of the 18th to mark the anterior trough of

the normal wave and the maximum of the 24th to indicate its crest, we have

the following elements and co-ordinates.

that, by discussing a long series of observations in this manner, a tolerable idea
of the succession and systems of waves may be formed, and the general fea-
tures of the normal waves made out. The one under consideration appears
to have had an interval of fifteen days. The great symmetrical wave of Nov.
I84'2 had nearly the same interval, and succeeding waves, possessing a simi-
larity of character both in interval and curve, were observed about the same
period of the year in 1843 and 1844'. The examination of these recurring

atmospheric movements forms the subject of the next portion of the report.

                             Section II.

                      Recurrence of Symmetrical Wave.

The diagram which accompanies this report (see Plate III.) exhibits three

curves to a great extent similar, at least in so far as there is a general tendency

in the barometer to rise during the period of the anterior half, and a similar
tendency in it to fall during the period of the posterior half. From what has

just been advanced, as well as from the discussions which were reported last

year, there is great reason to consider the indentations on the anterior and pos-

terior slopes of the curve of 1842 as distinct secondary and superposed waves

the same may be said of the indentations on the curves of 1843 and 1844.
Now it is probable that were we to separate the barometric effects of these
waves, we should obtain a much clearer conception of the form and general

elements of the normal wave which on the three occasions recorded passed

London. For this purpose the following steps have been taken. The gene-

ral contour of the curves indicates that the respective maxima passed about

the following dates.

                      1842. November 18, noon.

                      1843.        ,, 14, ,,
                      1844.  October 27, ,,

   These days (noon) are therefore assumed as the axes of the curves, and
the altitudes at intervals of two hours have been carefully read off from the
original projections, and a mean of the three taken, from which the follow-
ing Table has been constructed. The table is arranged in two compartments,

the first containing the ordinates of the anterior slope, the second those of

the posterior. The first column in the first compartment indicates the hours

--before the transit of the crest ( ) ; the second the mean ordinate correspond-

ing to any given hour. In like manner, the first column in the second compart-

+ment indicates the hours after the transit of the crest ( ), and the second the

mean ordinate corresponding to any given hour after transit. These num-
bers have been used in the construction of the fourth curve, which exhibits

to the eye the general form of the normal wave, freed to a certain extent of
the effects of the superposed waves.

   There are several drawbacks to the value of any conclusions that may be
drawn from these numbers and projections in their present state :

   1st. They are deduced from unreduced observations. The projections of
the three upper curves are laid down from observations as read off from the
scale without any reduction whatever, and the mean curve has been obtained
from these unreduced observations.

   2nd. The observations themselves were made at irregular intervals, so that in
deducing the mean, the quantities observed have not been used. The altitudes
at the given hours of the curves drawn through the points indicating these
observed quantities, are the quantities from which the mean has been obtained.

   3rd. The curves, and consequently the mean, consists of two distinct ele-

ments, namely, the pressure of the gaseous atmosphere and the pressure of
122 REPORT 1845.

the aqueous vapour. The normal wave of the gaseous atmosphere is there-
fore greatly modified by the pressure of the aqueous vapour in these projec-

tions.

elements of this normal wave freed from all extraneous circumstances. At

Munich we possess barometric records every hour for the three years ; these
are reduced to the freezing temperature and accompanied with observations
from which the tension of the vapour may be obtained. It will be. necessary

for the three periods embraced in the diagram to express the barometric al-

titudes in English inches, and reduce them to the level of the sea. When

so reduced the vapour pressure must be deducted, leaving the gaseous pres-
sure only, and this must be further corrected for the diurnal and annual
variations of the gaseous pressure ; we shall thus obtain three curves repre-
senting the variations of gaseous pressure, the causes of which we are seeking,
and the mean of these three curves will to a certain extent be freed from those

indentations which appear to result from the passage of secondary waves.

   The same process must be adopted with respect to the observations at
Prague, Brussels and Greenwich ; when this is accomplished we shall obtain
four normal curves, the comparison of which will be highly instructive and

important.

   The curve of 1842 is tinted for the purpose of indicating the prevalent
wind during the period occupied by one coloured portion. There does not
appear much apparent relation between the colours and the flexures of the

--curve. Two points, however, claim our especial attention, the change in

--the direction of the wind to nearly the opposite point, on the transit of the

crest, and the calms intervening between that and other changes nearly of a
similar character. N.E. winds are coloured blue, S.W. pink, and S.E. green.

The direction has been obtained from the Greenwich observations.
    Sir John Herschel has shown in his ' Report on the Reduction of Meteoro-

logical Observations' (Report, 184-3, p. 99), that there must be a close and
purely dynamical connexion between the advancing form of the wave and the
molecular movement of the air ; the character of the molecular movement will

greatly depend on the order of the wave. In the absence of data for deter-

mining the precise characters of the waves under consideration, it may not be

uninteresting to offer a few remarks on the two points to which our atten-

--tion has been directed : 1st. The calm preceding the reversion of wind on the
Atransit of the crest, Nov. 18th, 1842.
                                         very casual comparison of the direc-

tion of the wind at several stations marked on the area, shown in Plate XLII.

(Report, 1844), indicates that the molecular movement was directed towards

the point of least pressure, a result to be expected, and perfectly in accordance

with the beautiful deductions of Col. Sabine (see his Report on the Meteor-

ology of Toronto, Report, 1844). Now in the case of a large wave stretch-

ing over an extensive area, the anterior and posterior troughs would mark out
parallel or nearly parallel lines of least pressure ; the molecular movement
would be strongest in these troughs, and directed towards them from each
side ; at stations removed from them the force of the wind would be greatly

diminished, and at the intervening crest it would be so small as to be inap-
preciable ; but however small it might be, upon the crest passing any station,
the direction of the wind at that station would be reversed, and it would in-

crease in intensity until the transit of the posterior trough. In this manner
it is apprehended that the reversion of the wind, and the calm preceding it,
Nov. 18th, 1842, are explained. The Greenwich observations offer a fine
illustration of the increase of intensity. November 19th, 6 and 8 hours, the

anemometer recorded a pressure of 2 to 41bs. to the square foot 30 hours
after transit. 2nd. The remaining calms in the diagram may be explained

in the same way, but the synchronous traversing of different systems of waves

masks the effects and prevents the relations between the wind and the advan-

transit of the crest of the normal wave.

                                  Section III.

A AInvestigaiion of secondary Waves ], B2, 1 (reported last year).

In my letter to Sir John Herschel published in the last Report, I stated that

--the coloured projections indicated three things as connected with the disposi-

tion of the atmosphere : " 1 st, the depth or extent of colour will show the
depression of the lower station below the upper ; 2nd, the intersections of the

curves will indicate that at the time of intersection the stations had an

equality of pressure ; and 3rd, the change of the position of the same colour
will point out that the station which exhibited or experienced the higher or

lower pressure, afterwards experienced the lower or higher, with its amount."

In addition to these three indications, the coloured projections and the barometric

differences they exhibit may be very extensively and advantageously used
in this investigation, as at the time when any one intersection of the curves

shows an equality of pressure at the respective stations, the intersection also

indicates that either a crest or trough was passing between them. Now if,

from other considerations, it is found that at any intersection atrough is passing,

the next intersection will exhibit the passage of tlie crest ; the differences

therefore between the curves, or in other words, the differences of pressure

between the stations, will augment and decrease as the anterior slope passes,
the greatest differences occurring as the middle of the slope transits. The

same result will obtain as the posterior slope passes, but the affections of
pressure will be altered ; the station which exhibited the greatest pressure
under the anterior slope will manifest the least under the posterior. This
principle will indicate the passage of a wave independently of the state {i. e.
rising or falling) of the barometer at the time. The mercury may be falling

from the transit of the posterior slope of a wave passing in a certain direc-

tion,  and  this  may  occur  at  both  stations                             yet,  although both curves may be
                                                                          ;

descending from a posterior slope in one direction, the opening between them

may indicate the transit of an anterior slope in another.

   The last report brought the investigation as far as the determination of

Athe waves 1 and B 1 (Report, 1844, p. 273). The dimensions and velocity
Aof the latter were given ; also the character of the trough between 1 and
A 2. In the note to (24.), page 274, it is shown that these waves, especially

B 1, were small waves superposed on much larger ones. The principle just

alluded to enables us to determine the phases of the larger wave on which

B I rolled, not however uninfluenced by the transits of others, but sufficiently

well-marked to contemplate it in its individuality as it passed over the area

mingham, South Bishop, and St. Catherine's Point, from November 6 : 21 to
7: 21, leads to the very interesting fact that the anterior slope of this wave
extended in tiie direction from Glasgow to St. Catherine's Point. In the
Report of last year we have this statement, "that a line cutting the crest of

A·wave 1 transversely appears to have passed through Genevaand Brussels."
Report, ISM, p. 270 (2.). Now the line joining Glasgow and St Catherine's

Point is nearly parallel with that joining Geneva and Brussels, and a line cut-

Ating the crest of wave 1 transversely appears to have passed through Glas-

gow and St. Catherine's Point at 6 : 21. There can be but little doubt that

from results so nearly similar at pairs of stations a considerable distance from
each other and at epochs separated by an interval of 48 hours, we have iden-
tified a distinct and well-developed wave. It will be the object of future
research to trace this wave entirely across the area.

                                           Wave A°.

    The large wave alluded to in the remarks on B° is designated A°. Table XII.
exhibits the barometric differences or variations at the stations on the line
Scilly to Longstone ; at November 7 : 21, the stations Bardsey, South Bishop
and Scilly, experienced a rise indicating the transit of the crest ; the greatest
curvature occurred on this line at 8 : 15, and the posterior trough at 9 : 3. By
combining these epochs we have the principal phases of the posterior slope
 of this wave ; all these phases occur on the same line, clearly indicating that
 they are connected, and result entirely from a distinct and different cause to

--November 9 : 3 we have the following altitudes reduced to the level of the
sea:  November 9 : 3, Munich                       30*256

The close approximation of these differences appears to indicate that the

slope from Munich to Bardsey was due to, and a representation of, the form

of the posterior slope of A", and that at this epoch the crest of the wave was

situated near Munich ; if so, we have for the first approximate amplitude and

progress of this wave the following numbers :

Should A2 be found to be the succeeding wave to A', the above Table indi-

cates an interval of 3 days 5 hours (about) between these two successive crests.

The altitudes are very different in consequence of the large posterior slope ofA°.

At the commencement of this investigation, it was stated that the only ef-

ficient test that can be brought to bear on the theory that the non-periodic

oscillations of the barometer are due to waves, appears to be the comparison

of barometric observations reduced to the level of the sea. This view appears

to be supported as far as the investigation has yet proceeded. It is cha-

racteristic of waves that different systems pass onward without destroying

each other ; each wave of each system pursues its own path, although crossed

by others ; and it can be followed in all its individuality. In the course of

this inquiry three systems of waves have been detected, or at least three

barometric maxima ; these maxima have been found to move across the area
in three different directions, having on each side a diminution of pressui'e. The

progress of each of these maxima appears to have been quite independent of

the others : thus at the opening of the observations, the line of greatest

diminution of pressure on the English area was from Glasgow to St. Cathe-

rine's Point ; at a later period the observations indicated the direction of max-

ima at right angles to this line, and that a line cutting this transversely passed

through Geneva and Brussels ; it is in this latter direction that the wave

was considered to have been moving. The barometric phaanomena in this

direction progressed very slowly. While these movements were proceeding

over the area, the barometric differences between Scilly and Longstone in-

creased ; and the latter station exhibited a much less pressure than the former ;
at length a decided line of maximum pressure is traced from Dublin to Ge-

neva, after which the barometric affections at the stations are reversed, Scilly

Webeing the lowest and Longstone the highest.  have therefore a cause simul-

taneously operating on the barometer with that which produced the move-

ments from Glasgow to St. Catherine's Point, and from Brussels to Geneva,

but evidently distinct, as the phaenomena progressed in a different direction,

namely from Scilly to Longstone. During the period that these two distinct

but contemporaneous causes are in operation, producing certain barometric

phaenomena in certain directions, and from the last of which we should expect

at certain stations, Scilly and Longstone, for instance, a rising barometer, we

actually find it falling rapidly, but not without exhibiting the same phaeno-

Amena that we apprehend characterizes this fall as resulting from a wave.

decided line of maxima is observed ; and in the same line, at a subsequent
period, we find a line of minima; we can therefore, as previously remarked,

trace each of these distinct sets of barometric phaenomena in their own pe-

culiar directions. It is hovvever the reduction of the observations to the level

of the sea that alone enables us to do this. The rise and fall at any one

station, as exhibited by the curves (times being used as abscissae), give us

the combined effects of the three systems, and unless they are carefully sepa-

rated, as we have endeavoured to do in the preceding investigation, and which

can only be done by taking the distance of the stations into account, we are

perplexed with the apparent irregularity and capriciousness of the atmo-

spheric changes.
       ON savings' banks in the united kingdom.  129

   We have already alluded to the molecular movement of the aerial particles

 or the wind as connected with these waves, and an opinion has been expressed
 that it is probable that generally the wind will be found directed towards the
 troughs. It has also been remarked that the great disturbance of the atmo-
 sphere, after the period of comparative repose previous to the 6th of Novem-
 ber, was of a negative character, producing a great depression of the mercu-

rial column. Now the result of any great increase of temperature at any

station would be a diminution of the pressure of the gaseous atmosphere (see

ACol. Sabine's Report on the Meteorology of Toronto, Report, IS^^). cur-

rent, or rather currents of air, would be produced in consequence ; the baro-
meter would fall, and the wind Mould be directed towards the line of least
pressure (minima). This diminution of pressure would not however be con-
fined to the locality in which the disturbance was produced, or even to those
lines towards which the wind was directed, or the aerial current moved, it
would gradually recede from the point of disturbance, giving rise to a wind
in its progress still directed towards the line of least pressure ; the phagno-
mena presented would be a rapidly falling barometer with an increasing force
in the wind. This receding movement must be in the nature of a wave ; indeed

it is difficult to conceive of a disturbance of the aerial ocean being imme-

diately confined to the locality in which it originated.

    Mr. Scott Russell has determined that a wave of the first order does not
diff'use itself equally in all directions around the place of disturbance, but
that there is in one direction an axis along which it maintains the greatest

height, has the widest range of translation, and travels with the greatest velo-
city. Sufficient progress has not yet been made in this investigation, nor is

the area included by the extreme stations of observation extensive enough
to enable us to form any idea of the real character of these waves ; much
light however will be thrown on them by a careful comparison of the wind
at each observation ; and it appears essential to bear in mind the distinction
of Mr. Russell between waves of the first and second order, as any tests that
may be applied having reference only to the characteristics of Avaves of the
second order must necessarily fail, should these, especially the larger waves,

--be found analogous to waves of the first order.
   Postscript, Nov. 27, 1845 Section II. of the preceding Report treats of
the recurrence of certain symmetrical atmospheric movements in or near the
month of November. These symmetrical oscillations were observed in 1842,
1843 and 1844, and great hopes were entertained that during the present au-
tumn they would again be observed. These hopes have been fully realized,
the symmetrical wave has returned and has exhibited all its essential features.
The barometric curve on the present occasion more nearly resembles that of
1842 than those of the years 1843 and 1844 ; the large oscillation forming the
crest isvery distinctly marked. The apex passed London about noon of the 14th.
Observations have been made at nearly thirty stations in the united kingdom.

Sketch of the progress and present extent of Savings' Banks in the

              United Kingdom. By G. R. Porter, F.R.S.

Among the " signs of the times " which it is most satisfactory to contem-

plate, because it affords at once evidence of social progress, and furnishes the

best assurance for its continuance, must be placed the fact, that among the

classes of our countrymen who are in circumstances of ease and comfort

there has of late arisen a great and growing concern for the well-being of the

--less favoured and more numerous class those whose daily subsistence must be

--130 REPOET 1845.

acquired by their daily toil. Influences to this end have long been quietly

but steadily at work, set in motion by individuals, few in number and, for
the most part, of small account in the eyes of the world, who were at first
sustained only by the consciousness of duty performed, and who long remained

uncheered by any evidences of success ; those influences are now, however,

openly and even ostentatiously employed, they have found their way into

every circle, and have even received the homage of the senate. It has be-

come fashionable to express the desire of promoting the general welfare of
the working classes, and even to make some exertion to secure it, and we can

hardly conceive that this stage of the question could have been reached, un-

less through the sense of its importance having taken a firm hold of the pub-

lic mind, enlisting among its promoters men who, by means of their station
and intellectual endowments, must command the attention of society.

The present is not an occasion on which it would be proper to enlarge upon

the moral obligation to which allusion has now been made, but it is clearly with-

in the province of statistical inquiry to ascertain, as correctly as possible, the ac-

tual condition of those whom we would seek to benefit. Without such inquiries

we must always be, as it were, groping in the dark, and liable to make a pro-

fitless use of our energies, if even they should not be hurifully employed.

Various eff'orts, which have been attended with more or less of success, have

been made of late years by our statistical societies, and by means of govern-

ment commissioners, to place before the world true pictures of the social
condition of great masses of our fellow-countrymen, who form what, by a

somewhat arbitrary distinction, are called the working classes ; and from a
variety of journals and parliamentary reports much is to be learned concern-

ing their means of living, as well as the manner in which such means are em-

ployed. Our hours of leisure could hardly find better employment than in

studying the different volumes in which this subject is authoritatively treated,

in weighing the reconmiendations which they offer, and in helping to carry
into execution those among them which appear to call for adoption, and which

it may be in our power to forward. The volumes in question are within the

reach of every one, and it would be productive of but little good to call

away attention from them, by offering an analysis, or pretended analysis, of

their contents. There is, however, one subject, intimately connected with

the matters of which they treat, and which at the same time has become a
thing of national importance, inquiry into which may throw light upon every

branch of the subject, and which has not been made the matter of any recent

-- --investigation the progress of savings' banks, in describing which I would

now venture to solicit a few minutes of attention on the part of the Section.
   Savings' banks, it is well known, are to be placed among the inventions of

the present century. They are of English origin, although, happily, they are

Wenot now confined to these kingdoms.  owe their institution to a well-

known benevolent lady, Mrs. Priscilla Wakefield, who in 1804? induced six

gentlemen, residing at Tottenham, near London, to receive deposits from la-
bourers and servants, and to be responsible for their safety and return when
needed to the depositors, with 5 per cent, interest thereon, provided the sum

were not less than 20,?., and had remained for a year at least in their hands.
Deposits of not less than Is. were received. Four years later (1808) eight

individuals, of whom four were ladies, took upon themselves the like respon-

sibility at Bath, engaging to pay 4 per cent, interest upon all deposits up to
50/., but limiting to 2000/. the whole sum to be deposited. In the same year,

the late Mr. Whitbread tried, without success, to procure legislative sanction
for a plan, whereby the small savings of the industrious labourer and artisan

would be placed under the safeguard of public commissioners.

The first savings' bank, regularly and minutely organized, was " The

Drish Ban k Friendly Society of Ruthwell" in umfries-shire, established through

the exertions of Mr. Henry Duncan in 1810, and it was mainly owing to its
success, as set forth in the published reports of that gentleman, that many

other institutions were formed upon the model of that at Ruthwell, so that

before any legislative provision had been made for their encouragement there

existed 70 savings' banks in England, 4 in Wales, and 4 in Ireland.

In July 1817 two acts received the royal assent for encouraging the esta-

blishment of banks for savings in England and Wales, and in Ireland. It was

not until 1835 that these institutions were placed under legislative regula-

tion in Scotland, a circumstance which in all probability is to be ascribed to

the facilities given by bankers in that part of the kingdom for the profitable

deposit with them of small sums. Under the acts of 1817, the sums depo-

sited were placed by the trustees of each bank in the hands of the Commis-

sioners for the reduction of the National Debt, who thereupon issued deben-

tures for the amount bearing interest at the rate of 3d. per centum per diem,

or 4/. lis. 3d. per cent, per annum. It was customary for the trustees to allow

4 per cent, only to the depositors, retaining the balance of the interest received

from government to defray tlie necessary charges of the establishment for

office-rent, clerks, &c.

The progress of these savings' banks, after receiving the sanction of the

legislature, has become a matter of national importance, not only as affording

means forjudging concerning the actual and comparative condition, from

time to time, of those classes of persons Avho make deposits, but also as in-

centives to prudence, and in some degree, too, as security for good citizen-

ship, among a very numerous body, now numbering more than a million of
our fellow-subjects, who are thus made to feel that they too have an interest

in the stability of government, and something to lose from acts of violence.

By this means some slight degree of sympathy in feeling and interest has been

created between classes as toM^hom that link was previously wanting, so that the

untaught or ill-taught labourerorartisanwhohasasmall,but to him important,

capital arising from his savings and deposited in the savings' bank,can no longer

look with the same feelings of estrangement as formerly upon those whose
savings, or those of their prudent ancestors, may have exceeded his own.

   During the five months that followed the passing of the acts of 18173 ^iz.
to January 5, 1818, the savings deposited with the Commissioners for the re-
duction of the National Debt amounted to 328,282/. In each of the following

thirteen years, to January 5, 1831, the sums so deposited were

to have been permanently lodged, since the sum remaining in deposit on the

      From and after the 20th of November 1829, detailed statements have
   been made up from year to year, showing the sums remaining in deposit in-
   cluding interest, and the number of depositors in various classes according
   to the amount of their deposits, in each division and in each county of the
   kingdom. The aggregate numbers of depositors and sums deposited are
   shown in the following summary.

     It will be seen, that with the exception of only one year in the entire

series, there has been a constantly increasing sum thus deposited. In 1832,

doubtless owing to the political ferment in which the nation was then in-

volved, there was a positive decrease in England and Wales, both in the

number of depositors and the amount of their balances, viz.

           England. . . . 6,426 fewer depositors £398,328 less deposits.

           Wales         360       ditto            21,037   ditto.

The preceding year, also a time of political excitement, was marked by a
much smaller addition than usual to the numbers and amounts of 1830, the

increase having been, in

                  England.. . . 12,318 depositors £67,011 deposits.

                  Wales        170 ditto            7,643 ditto.

The increase in 1833, when the public mind had become more tranquillised,

was, in    England        28,903 depositors £724,223 deposits.

           Wales              1,001 ditto           28,378 ditto.

   It is worthy of remark, that although the same cause agitated the public
in Ireland to which we have attributed this effect in England, it was not
accompanied by the same result, possibly because the condition of agitation
is one to which the people of Ireland are more accustomed than their fellow-
subjects in England. The accounts for those years do not include Scotland.
The increase, embracing England, Wales and Ireland, up to 1835, and there-
after including Scotland also, has been

   It is impossible not to remark the superiority over the other years of the
series of 1836, 1838, 1843 and 1844, all of which were years of great com-
mercial activity, and all, with the exception of 1838, years of cheapness.

   It would have added unreasonably to the number of figures with which
any statement of this kind must be more or less accompanied, if the depo-
sitors had in each year been classified according to the amount of their de-
posits. This classification for the year 1844 was as follows:

   With the exception of the last two years of the series, in which there has

exhibit a marked difference between England and Ireland, the average sum
having regularly diminished in the former division, while it has as regularly-

increased in the latter division.

the needful labour be not withheld. On the other hand, it may create sur-

prise that Lancashire, at the head of our manufacturing population, should
stand so low in the scale with regard to the savings of the working classes,
that there should be twenty-five counties of England, the average deposits in
which are greater. This too is capable of explanation that must be satisfac-
tory. In towns, and especially in places that are rapidly increasing, as the
manufacturing towns and villages of Lancashire and the neighbouring counties
have long been, more profitable opportunities present themselves for the in-

vestment of small sums than are offered by savings' banks. Among these
opportunities building-clubs are common in those localities, and absorb the
working man's savings to an extent which few persons who have not inquired

into the subject would conceive probable.

   The advantage held forth by the government to the working man as an in-
ducement for him to save a portion of his earnings, was greater under the
acts of 1817 than it is at present. The rate of interest then fixed was, as

already stated, 3d. per centum per diem, or 4/. lis. 3d. per cent, per annum,
out of which the allowance made to depositors was usually i per cent., the
remaining lis. 3c?. being retained to defray expenses. There was no restric-
tion then placed upon depositors as to the amount of their savings ; they might
deposit 100/. the first year and 50/. every year after, so long as they might
be inclined or able to do so, and they might make investments in as many
different savings' banks as they judged proper and could effect. In time,
however, parties not contemplated by the legislature in framing the law, find-
ing that they could thus secure a higher rate of interest than was yielded by
the public funds, and at the same time save all risk of fluctuation in the value
of their deposits, used the savings' banks to an inconvenient extent, and in
1824 an act was passed limiting the amount that might be deposited the first
year to 50/., and all future yearly deposits to 30/., with the further restrictions
that no person should receive interest upon any amount beyond 200/., nor
should be allowed to leave deposits in more than one savings' bank. In
1828 the rate of interest was reduced to 2^^?. per centum per diem, or 3/. 8*.

5^. per cent, per annum ; the largest sura to be received in any one j'^ear
was fixed at 30/., and 150/. was adopted as the largest sum upon which inter-

est would be paid to any one depositor. In 1833 the laws relating to savings'
banks were extended to the Channel Islands, and in 1835, as already stated,
they were made to embrace Scotland. The latest act for the regulation of
these institutions was passed in 1844 ; it further lowered the rate of interest
paid by the public to 3^ per cent, per annum, reducing to 2c?. per centum per
diem, or 3/. Os. 10c?. per cent, per annum the allowance to depositors. This
change took effect from and after the 20th of November 1 844, the day to which
the statements now brought forward are made up. Whether or not the allow-
ing of a liberal rate of interest has much influence on the minds of the work-
ing classes, leading them to spare a portion of their earnings, is a question

--which the result of this change may enable us to answer. If that answer

should be in the affirmative if the now diminished allowance for interest
should in any degree check the disposition to saving on the part of the classes
for whom savings' banks are opened, the economy of parliament in thus re-
stricting that allowance will prove a measure of very doubtful wisdom, and
one as to which the legislature cannot too soon retrace its steps.

    It is to be regretted that the managers of savings' banks have not generally
availed themselves of the opportunities which they possess for throwing light
upon the condition and habits of the various classes making deposits, by re-

cording and publishing their occupations. Many years ago the Statistical

Society of London addressed circular letters to each savings' bank then exist-
.

of possessing correct knowledge upon the subject. This well-meant effort
proved however wholly abortive. Some feAV of these establishments are ac-
customed to publish such information; among these are the "Devon and
Exeter Savings' Bank," already mentioned, and the " Manchester and Salford
Bank for Savings." As it may be useful to know the result exhibited by the
accounts of two establishments, similar in their object but differing so mate-
rially in their circumstances, I shall close this sketch by calling attention to

their several statements.

--142 REPORT 1845.

Report on the Gases evolved from Iron Furnaces, with reference to the
   Theory of the Smelting of Iron. By Prof. Bunsen, of Marburg,
   Hesse Cassel, and Dr. Lyon Playfair, of the Museum of (Economic
   Geology, department of Her Majesty's Woods and Forests.

In laying before the Association the report which we have now the honour
to present, we are desirous, at the commencement of our subject, to examine
closely the methods employed in the analyses of gases, not only as an argu-
ment in favour of the processes used by ourselves, but also with the hope of

improving the present state of eudiometry.

   Two distinct methods are employed in the analysis of combustible gases
one of which consists in an exact determination of the volumes of the gas

about to be examined, and of those resulting from the combustion of its con-

stituents with oxygen. By the other method, the products of combustion

are collected in the liquid and solid form, and estimated directly according

to WEIGHT.
   The last method would doubtless deserve the preference if we had to ope-

rate upon a mixture of gases capable of being determined by the products of
combustion without reference to the quantity of oxygen necessary to effect it
in other words, when we have to examine a mixture containing only two
combustible gases. In such a case, the combustion by means of oxide of
copper aifords products well-adapted for exact determination by weight.
But, on the contrary, when the quantity of oxygen necessary for the com-
bustion must be introduced as an element into the calculation, as is the case
with the gases examined by us in the present paper, the method of analysis
by weight is not only inexpedient, but also inexact. If that method were to
be adopted, it is necessary to determine the loss (often not amounting to
above a few centigrammes) sustained by a heavy combustion-tube, by weigh-
ing it before and after the experiment, and thus subjecting it to all the sources
of error due to a varying hygroscopic condition, and to the loss in weight oc-
casioned by the long exposure of a considerable body of glass to a red heat.

Another source of error equally great consists in the necessity for filling the
whole apparatus for combustion and condensation with nitrogen gas previous
to the commencement of the experiment. The smallest quantity of oxygen
which may remain in the gas, or in the porous oxide of copper, or which

may be introduced by diffusion, must derange the results, and cause great
uncertainty in the determinations. Any error arising from this source is so
much the more to be feared, because it does not affect one constituent merely,

 but extends its influence equally to the ascertained value of all the other in-

 gredients.

   We cannot afford better arguments for the reception of our methods of

 investigation than by briefly reviewing the results obtained by different in-
 quirers in the examination of the gases evolved from furnaces worked by

 charcoal. It is obvious that the composition of these gases cannot be the

 same under all circumstances, for the nature of the fuel, the pressure of the
 blast, and even the shape of the furnace itself, must exert a varying influence
 in modifying the processes which affect the composition of the gases. But
 when we consider, at the same time, that these modifying influences have

 their maximum and minimum in corresponding parts of furnaces treated in a
 similar manner, we still have a right to expect an elucidation of the law regu-
 lating the formation of the gases by a careful comparison of their compo-
 sition. One of us first endeavoured to solve this problem by an examination

 of the gases issuing from the furnace of Vickerhagen, although he did not

 then consider the results obtained in the inquiry as expressive of a general
--

theory of the nature of the processes in the furnace. This research was
afterwards pursued in a similar manner, and with confinnatory results, by
Scheerer and Langberg in the iron-works of Baerum. Both these chemists
have conferred a lasting benefit on this new field of metallurgical inquiry
by their elaborate investigations ; and as their experiments agree with those
performed in Germany, the generality of the law regulating the production
and action of the solid and gaseous products of charcoal-furnaces is esta-
blished. This is shown by a comparison of the results obtained at Vicker-
hagen and Baerum :

the pressure of the blast, as soon as proper data are furnished bj continued

inquiries in this field of research.

   The great accordance between the results of the two series of experiments
now detailed, executed as they were quite independently of each other, the
one series in Germany, the other in Norway, renders it surprising that a similar
inquiry instituted by Ebelmen on the furnaces of Clerval and Audincourt
sliould have led to results differing so essentially from those now described.

This chemist gives the following composition, according to volume, for the
gases of the furnace at Clerval :

whether carburetted hydrogen ought to be considered as an essential con-
stituent of the gases, and whether its absence in the cases cited is due to an

error in Ebelmen's analyses.
   It is well known that ordinary charcoal is very far from being pure carbon,

and that it in fact contains about 20 per cent, of foreign matters, which
escape as gaseous and liquid products when it is heated to redness. If car-
buretted hydrogen form, as is generally supposed, an essential constituent of
the gases resulting from the distillation of wood-charcoal, it is quite clear that
it cannot be absent from the gases of furnaces supplied with that fuel. Al-
though the presence of carburetted hydrogen in the gases obtained by the
distillation of charcoal is generally acknowledged, we have thought it not
superfluous to put this fact beyond all doubt by a renewed examination. The
charcoal subjected to experiment was heated in a narrow glass tube, con-
nected with a long dry tube to retain the liquid products of distillation, and
the gases, after passing through this, were collected over mercury. In order
to remove any elayl or hydrated oxide of methyl, which might possibly have
accompanied the gases, they were conducted through a long tube filled with
fuming sulphuric acid, attached to which was another tube moistened with
water. The analysis of the gases was then effected in an exact eudiometer,
and according to the methods which we describe in an after part of this report.

  AI. specimen of very well-burnt charcoal, from beech-wood, yielded a

gas of the following composition, according to volume :

If we assume the most unfavourable condition to the calculation, that the

charcoal used in the furnace of Clerval was of the most select quality, which

could not have been the case, it follows from the analysis and consumption

of charcoal at that place, that no less than 479 cubic feet of light carburetted

hydrogen must have escaped from the top of the furnace every hour, and yet

not a trace of this large quantity is to be found in Ebelmen's analyses. The

above experiments prove beyond contradiction that the carburetted hydrogen

found by Scheerer and by us in the gases from charcoal, is actually an essen-

tial constituent of furnace- gases. Tlie absence of tins important ingre-
dient from Ebelmen's analyses might be explained on the supposition that
the gases upon which he operated were collected from a part without the
column of charcoal, and between it and the lining of the furnace. However,

we cannot reproach Ebelmen with drawing a theory of the mutual action of
the gaseous and solid products of the furnace from a mixture of gas which

had only partially been subjected to this action, because the presence of 7 per
cent, of hydrogen indicated by his analyses would be still more inexplicable

on this supposition. Hence we must look to another source for the errors in

his analyses, and it will be found to lie in the incompleteness of the methods

used by him. His method of determining the nature and composition of the

combustible gases, was to pass them over red-hot oxide of copper, collecting

the products of combustion in the usual way, and forming an opinion of the

presence or absence of carburetted hydrogen by the loss in weight of the
combustion-tube. In order to show the degree of inaccuracy of this method,

it will be best to choose a special case as an example, and as such we select

the first analysis of the gases of Clerval. The volume of gas used in his ex-

periments, 1500 cubic centimetres*, contained 87'3 cubic centimetres of
hydrogen and 352*65 cubic centimetres of carbonic oxide gas. In order to

burn this quantity, the combustion-tube suffered a loss in weight of 0'3160
gramme. If we supposed the whole of the hydrogen to be present as car-

buretted hydrogen, taking its cai'bon from a corresponding quantity of car-

bonic oxide, the 1500 cubic centimetres of gas must have contained 43*65

carburetted hydrogen and 309*0 carbonic oxide ; and, on this supposition, the
combustion-tube must have diminished in weight 0*3473 gramme, instead of
0*3150 gramme. It will be seen from this calculation, that the question as

to whether the mixture of gases contains 5*82 per cent, hydrogen, or instead

of that quantity, 3*09 light carburetted hydrogen, is entirely dependent upon
a difference in weight of not more than 0'0323 gramme. Let us assume

that the weight of the combustion-tube and its contents was 80 grammes,

then an error of y^^-g^ in the weighing would cause a change in the results
from the composition, as found by Ebelmen, to that placed beside it calculated
on this supposition :

    Such uncertainties as these are never to be feared in a eudiometric ana-

lysis conducted with proper precautions; for they would imply errors in
measurement which could not take place without the most gross negligence.

Now when we consider the circumstances which would tend to diminish the

loss in weight of the combustion-tube in Ebelmen's experiments, and con-

   * In the details of our analyses we always employ the French weights and measiires, now
universally used on the cojitinent, and by most of our eminent chemists in tliis country.
Their convenience is very great, and as science is universal and not local, English memoirs
are more readily adojited on the continent when the translators have not the trouble of re-
ducing our weights and measures. Where the numbers are absolute a)id not relative, we

sequently diminish the quantity of carburetted hydrogen, while it increased

that of hydrogen, we shall be the more inclined to attribute the erroneous
results of his experiments to the uncertain methods employed by him in ana-
lysis. The smallest quantity of oxygen remaining in the nitrogen with which
the apparatus was filled previous to the experiment, the gases retained by the
porous copper formed during the reduction, the carbon also retained by this
copper, the smallest quantity of foreign substances which may attach them-
selves to the combustion-tube, softened as it is by heat during the experi-

--ment, all these must tend to increase the chances of an error of ^otoo ^^

weighing ; a difference so small as even without the operation of these causes
almost to be within the errors of observation, and sufficient to account for

the erroneous results obtained by Ebelmen. But whatever may have been
the grounds which induced Ebelmen to avoid referring to the original inves-
tigations in Germany, when we consider the great labour which he bestowed

on the inquiry, it will ever remain to be regretted that he did not introduce
into his memoir an explanation of the grounds upon which he accorded the
preference to his method of analysis, which differs from that of his prede-
cessors in the inquiry more by its tediousness than its accuracy, and which

we consider it necessary altogether to avoid in the following research. At
the same time it cannot be denied, that eudiometric analysis, as usually

performed, is little deserving of high commendation, or of universal adoption,

although this is less owing to its incompleteness than to the neglect of the
many precautions which should be adopted to procure accuracy.

   Before proceeding to our investigation, we thought it necessary to examine

with great care all the conditions essential to obtain a proper degree of ac-

curacy. It cannot, therefore, be thought superfluous to describe in detail
the methods employed in the inquirj'^, especially as these must form the foun-

dation for the reception of the conclusions which we draw from the experi-

ments.

    The combustion and measurement of the gases is most conveniently and
accurately performed in uniform glass tubes of 18-19 inches in length and
about 0"6 inch internal and 0*8 inch external diameter ; in the closed end of

the tube there is inserted by fusion two platina wires of the thickness of horse
hair, for the purpose of passing the electric spark. The tube is divided into
millimetres, and with this view, is covered with common etching paste, or

still better, with a thin layer of wax containing a little turpentine, which may
be laid very uniformly on the warmed surface of the glass by means of a
hair pencil. The glass is then minutely graduated by a peculiar instru-
ment, and subjected to the action of gaseous hydrofluoric acid, which, when

evolved from a paste of fluoride of calcium and concentrated sulphuric acid
placed in a vessel of lead slightly warmed, effects the etching in ten to fifteen

minutes, and much more legibly than the liquid hydrofluoric acid usually

employed in the graduation of thermometers.
    The capacity of the tube, which has thus been divided into millimetres,

is easily determined by measurement. For this purpose, the tube is placed
vertically with the table, its hermetically sealed end being downwards, and
is then filled with successive portions of mercury carefully measured. The
different lengths occupied by these equal volumes correspond to equal capa-
cities of the tube. If the mercury in the successive parts of the tube ab, be,

Lcd, de, &c. take up the lengths measured on the graduation L' L" L'", and

the short parts of the tube ab, be, cd, &c. be considered uniform in calibre,

we obtain respective values of the divisional marks between ab, be, &c. with
respect to the volumes corresponding to them expressed by the unity cor-

Vresponding to the length L, when L" L'", &c. are divided bv L. On add-

                                                                     l2

ing together these quantities, a graduation originally arbitrary becomes a

Wecomparable measure corresponding to the capacity of the tube.  obtain

by this means a table of correction which gives the true volume of the tube

corresponding to each mark.

It is necessary, in order to obviate the parallax on reading from the surface

of the mercury, to use a small moveable mirror (Plate IV. fig. 1), which is

placed on the opposite side of the tube. If the pupil of the eye seen through

the tube in the mirror appears halved by the mark corresponding to the con-

vexity of the mercury, the reading may be considered as exact. If the

volume of the measured gas be read, as must always be the case, from the

highest point of the convexity of the mercury, we must add to the correc-

tions a small constant quantity deduced from the value found in the plate,

and which may be named the fault of the convexity, the necessity for which

--will be rendered obvious by the following consideration : If the reading of

the volume of the mercury during the measurement of the instrument be at

the mark a, the capacity a ab is not measured, but only the volume c g eb
(fig. 2). Now on using the instrument, if we read a volume of gas at the

same mark a, while the convexity takes the place dgZ, this volume as read

+does not correspond to c g e b, but to the real capacity c^ei dcgel.

Hence the quantity dc g el is not measured by the reading, and must there-

fore be added to the volumes observed, whicli otherwise would be too small.

This quantity may be ascertained by an experiment, and serves for all fu-

ture corrections. If a dilute solution of bichloride of mercury be placed in

contact with the convexity, it disappears immediately, on account of the for-

mation of a thin layer of protochloride of mercury which adheres to the glass.

The mercury now shows the horizontal surface fb. The quantity caae'\&

obviously equal to fc a a (if, which may be measured directly by the divi-

sions on the tube. Hence the quantity edle must be equal to 2 X a a ^f,

which is the quantity that must be added to the observed volume on every

reading.

Another source of error may arise from air bubbles, which are apt to at-

tach themselves to the glass during the filling of the tube, and being loosened

when gas is admitted, render the latter impure. If these bubbles of air be

visible to the naked eye, it is easy enough to separate them by means of a

wire ; but the walls still remain covered with microscopic bubbles which
cannot be removed in this way. In order, therefore, to prevent altogether

this danger to the experiment, it is necessary to clean very carefully with

unsized paper the walls of the tube after every experiment, and to introduce

the mercury by means of a funnel with a long neck ending in a narrow

opening at the lower end, and placed at the bottom of the tube. The mer-

cury flowing from this funnel adheres to the walls of the tube, with a perfectly

clear mirror-like surface.

Especial care must be taken that air neither enters nor escapes during the

combustion of the gas in the eudiometer. This evil is perfectly avoided by

pressing the open end of the instrument, during the explosion, upon a per-

fectly smooth sheet of caoutchouc placed under the mercury in the pneumatic

trough. However, it is quite necessary to take care that the caoutchouc has

not carried down with it any air, which might easily find its way into the

eudiometer by the diminished tension of the gas. The caoutchouc is there-

fore moistened with a solution of corrosive sublimate, and very slowly sunk

into the mercury ; the protochloride of mercury formed between the mercury
and the caoutchouc causes such complete adhesion as to exclude all air.

Finally, the reading can only be made exact by using the mirror formerly

described, and estimating the position of the level of the column of mercury
ON THE GASES EVOLVED FROM IRON FURNACES.      149

in the eudiometer above that in the trough, so that the difference may be
brought into the calculation. By reading in this manner the error is avoided,
which otherwise would result from heating the gases by the hand in adjust-

ing the outer and inner levels, and it also enables us to record the results
without touching the apparatus, which thus preserves a constant temperature.

It is quite necessary, in estimating the volumes of the gases, to use the sub-

stances for absorption in a bulk as small as possible, and in a form which

may easily and completely be removed from the tubes, so that the gases may

neither be rendered impure by air introduced, nor their reading rendered

erroneous by some of the absorbing substance adhering to the sides of the

tube. This is best effected by casting the materials into the form of bullets,

by means of a common bullet-mould, into which a thin piano wire has, been

previously introduced. If there are to be two determinations of carbonic

acid, the one before the combustion of the gas, the other after, it is neces-

sary to transfer the gas from one eudiometer to another, after the first deter-

mination, in order to avoid the chance of error which might result from potash

adhering to the side of the tube during the first absorption ; and for this

purpose it is obviously of little consequence whether the whole or only a part
of the volume of the gas be transferred. The adhesion of air to the piano

wire is so insignificant, that it might be completely neglected ; but to avoid

error, it is better to amalgamate the outer surface of the iron wire ; this may
be done by rubbing it with an amalgam of potassium and mercury, without

destroying its tenacity. Rusty iron wire must not on any account be em-

ployed, and equal care must be taken to keep its inferior end under the mer-

cury during the absorption ; for if it be exposed to the air, an endosmose
and exosmose is effected to such an extent, as in certain cases to endanger

the value of the analysis.

In order to estimate olefiant gas and the hydrocarbons accompanying it,

we have invented a very simple and efficacious method, which may be use-

Afully employed in the analysis of coal-gas.  little bullet is prepared out of

the same materials as those used for making the negative element of the coal

battery. For this purpose a bullet-mould, supplied with a platinum-wire

having a bent end, is filled with a pounded mixture of two parts of coke and

one part of coal, and is then heated before the blowpipe flame. The ball
made in this way is afterwards dipped into a concentrated solution of sugar,

and heated very strongly in the open reducing flame of the blowpipe ; it is
now ready, and must be preserved for use carefully protected from moisture.

This lump of charcoal, about the size of a small pistol-bullet, is capable of
absorbing into its pores 0*5 gramme of sulphuric acid without appearing wet

on the surface, and it can be introduced into and withdrawn from the eudio-

meter without moistening it to any appreciable extent. For the purpose of
experiment, it is made to absorb a mixture consisting of one part of anhy-

drous and two parts of concentrated hydrated sulphuric acid. The proof

that the acid contained in the bullet has been sufficient for the absorption of

the olefiant gas, is the emission of white fumes in the air after its withdrawal

from the mixture of gases, which of course must be quite dry. As the an-

hydrous sulphuric acid emits vapour possessing considerable tension, and is

never obtained free from sulphurous acid, and as the latter gas is also formed

by the action of sulphuric acid on the hydrocarbons, an augmentation of the

volume of the mixture is thus produced. To remove both these sources of

error, after the conclusion of the above experiment, a little dry ball made of

gypsum and peroxide of lead is introduced into the eudiometer. This has

the double effect of removing both, for while the peroxide of lead absorbs
                                    --:

150 REPORT 1845.

the sulphurous acid, the anhydrous sulphuric acid robs the gypsum of part
of its water, thus becoming hydrated sulphuric acid and losing its tension.

   When the oxygen is estimated, not by combustion with hydrogen, but by

absorption with phosphorus, the precaution must always be taken to sepa-

rate the vapours of phosphorous acid by a bullet of caustic potash, before

effecting the measurement.

As the tension of the aqueous vapour, and in fact every known precau-

tionary means were adopted in our experiments, we believe it to be unne-

cessary to enter into further detail. But, at the same time, a^ it is necessary

that we should submit to the Association some proofs of the degree of accu-

racy which we profess to have attained in this mode of analysis, we do not
consider it superfluous to lay before it a series of analyses of common air,

made with eudiometers such as have been described, but of various sizes,

and with air collected at different times, the analyses being made with the

precautions recommended by us. And we are less afraid of being accused

of unnecessarj' detail, because these analyses show most decidedly that the

presence of nitrogen during the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen does

not cause the formation of ammonia, or of any degree of oxidation of ni-

Wetrogen.  thought this question, involving as it does the whole value of our

labours, so important as to be submitted to rigorous experimental research.

The air employed in these experiments was collected in the neighbour-

hood of Marburg in the open air, and carefully freed from carbonic acid

the measurement of the respective volumes of gases was eflfected at the maxi-

mum of moisture.

trogen does not exercise any disturbing influence on the estimation of explo-
sive mixtures of gases.

The nature of the gases ascending through the various parts of an iron

furnace is obviously dependent upon the nature of the fuel used in it.
Coke, brown coal and wood yield a gas containing as combustible consti-
tuents only carburetted hydrogen, carbonic oxide and hydrogen. The ana-
lysis of such a mixture offers no difficulties, and the proportion of the gases
may be easily calculated if we are acquainted with the volume occupied by
the oxygen which disappears, and that of the carbonic acid produced, re-
ferring them to the volume of gas employed.

If we call any given mixture of gas A, consisting of x hydrogen, y light

carburetted hydrogen, and p carbonic oxide ; and further call the oxygen
necessai-y for the combustion B, and the carbonic acid produced C, we ob-

tain the following equations:

                               =x + y -\-p A,

                         ^x+2y+\p = By

                               y+p = C;

But the gas generated, when coal is used as fuel, may contain, in addition to

the above gases, olefiant gas, gaseous hydrocarbons of various compositions,

and sulphuretted hydrogen. The examination of such a complex mixture of

gases offers rare difficulties, which may be overcome by estimating directly

the sulphuretted hydrogen and the hydrocarbons differing in composition

from light carburetted hydrogen. Sulphuretted hydrogen is easily enough

determined, but for the estimation of hydrocarbons, not even an approximative

method is known. It is quite true that they may be condensed by free chlorine

in the dark ; but the necessity of making such experiments over water render

the results wholly inexact. This method also gives a source of error, which

becomes materially increased by the circumstance that the tension of the sub-

stance containing chlorine formed by the condensation cannot be brought into

Wethe calculation.  have therefore tried to condense the gases in a proper

apparatus by means of perchloride of antimony. In order to be sure of the

applicability of this substance, it was necessary to be certain that this com-

pound of chlorine kept back the desired hydrocarbon without acting upon

the remaining constituents of the mixture. It may easily be proved that

carbonic oxide, light carburetted hydrogen and hydrogen are left quite un-

changed by it, for after streaming through the liquid contained in a Liebig's

potash apparatus, they are again obtained unaltered in quantity or in proper-

ties. But it was not so simple to decide whether olefiant gas and the other

hydrocarbons of unknown composition were separated in this way pure and

Wecapable of quantitative determination.  have endeavoured to decide this

question in a way certainly somewhat tedious, but not the less positive. In the
first place, it was necessary to be satisfied of the correctness of the opinion
generally received, but, as far as we are aware, unproved, that the gaseous

products of distillation of coal, in addition to carbonic oxide, hydrogen, ole-

fiant gas and carburetted hydrogen, still contained other hydrocarbons. If
the latter be absent, we are able by a eudiometric analysis to determine the
constituents of a mixture of gases containing four ingredients, if we estimate

for a given volume of the mixture A, the quantity of oxygen necessary for its
combustion B, and the carbonic acid thus formed C, and also the proportion
of the latter to the amount of aqueous vapour produced. Thus it requires

A H+ HC +mixture consisting of 1 vol.                     1 vol. CO =4 vol.

   If we denote these quantities by the same letters as above, the olefiant
gas by z, and the proportion of the aqueous vapour produced by the com-

--bustion to the carbonic acid as , the following four equations result

               7. p=-2B + c(^ + 2y

   If the mixture of gases contain actually only the four assumed consti-
tuents, we obtain positive values for x, y, z and p. If one of these quan-
tities be negative, this is a proof that the mixture must contain other com-

pounds than those assumed.
    In order to obtain something conclusive as to the nature of coal-gas, a

quantity of coal was heated to redness in a combustion-tube, in such a man-
ner that the gaseous products of distillation were not obliged to traverse the
red-hot layers of coal. The gas was first conducted into a cool receiver,
where it deposited the liquid products of distillation, after which it was freed
from carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen by means of a solution of
oxide of lead in potash, and also from water by being made to pass through
a tube filled with chloride of calcium, leading into a eudiometer standing

over mercury. An indefinite quantity of the gas was also led over red-hot

oxide of copper, and yielded 0-23749 grm. carbonic acid and 0-2239 grm.

we possess all the data for estimating the amount of light carburetted hy-
drogen, carbonic oxide and hydrogen, not only by the formulas 1, 2, 3, but
also by those afterwards described (4, 5, 6, 7) for calculating the quantities
of light carburetted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, olefiant gas and hydrogen
contained in a mixture. When both these calculations agree, and when we
obtain by the last of them c as the value of the olefiant gas, this result may
be viewed as a certain proof of the complete retention of the olefiant gas and
other hydrocarbons of unknown composition by the perchloride of antimony

   The agreement of these results may be considered as a proof of the appli-

cability of perchloride of antimony for our purposes, as the differences are
quite within the errors of observation, and as similar differences might arise

by a variation from unity in the third decimal of the expression -p. But to

remove every possible doubt as to the accuracy of our results, we have taken

the specific gravity of the mixture of gases treated with perchloride of anti-
mony, and compared this result with the theoi-etical density as calculated from

the known composition.

   In estimating the specific gravity, it was of importance to operate upon a
smaller volume of gas than usual, because it was necessary to have the same
gas collected over mercury, not only in the combustion with oxide of cop-
per, and in the eudiometric analysis, but also in taking the density of the

Wegas.  have therefore used in our experiments a plan somewhat deviating

from that usually adopted, and which for simplicity and accuracy merits to

be followed in other cases. The vessel used for weighing the gas consisted

of a flask such as that used for digestion, and of a capacity of 200 cubic cen-

timetres ; the neck of this flask was drawn out before the blowpipe until the

opening was narrowed to the thickness of a straw, and was then supplied

with a well-fitted ground glass stopper. This flask, the capacity of which

had been previously accurately determined, was filled with mercury, with the

precautions already described (page 148), and the gas to be weighed was then

introduced, leaving however the mercury still in the vessel, to the height of

one- or two-tenths of an inch. The apparatus, with its mouth placed under

mercury, is placed as vertically as possible, and allowed to acquire a uniform

temperature. When this has taken place the stopper is introduced, and by

means of an etched graduation on the neck, the height of the mercury over

the level of that in the trough is accurately noted, in order to deduct this

from the column of mercury in the barometer observed at the same time.

The flask, removed from the trough, and carefully cleaned on the outside, is

then weighed, with all the necessary data for corrections employed in such

cases, after which it is filled with dry air, care being taken that none of its

liquid contents are lost in doing so ; and then it is again weighed. An ex-

periment made in this way with gas purified by perchloride of antimony, gave

the following result :

Volume of the gas weighed at 9° C. and 0'7337 pressure, 211*05 cubic

    centimetres.

Weight of the flask filled with gas at 9°-9 C. and 0-7557 pressure, 49-0262

    grms.

--Weight of the flask filled with air at 3°-5 C.and 0-7557 pressure, 49-1920

grms.

   The specific gravity, 0-4073, which results from this experiment, does not
differ from 0-41, the density calculated from the above analysis, more than we
might expect, from the possibility of error of observation in such experiments.

   The experiments now detailed prove that other hydrocarbons must be
present, besides defiant gas and light carburetted hydrogen, but they do not
show whether olefiant gas itself is contained in the mixture. Its presence is
however easily shown, by the circumstance that the perchloride of antimony
used in the absorption yields by distillation with water chloride of elayle

with all its characteristic properties.

   When a stream of gas, obtained by the distillation of coal, is conducted

through a Liebig's tube filled with a solution of oxide of lead in potash, a pre-
cipitate falls, consisting of sulphuret and carbonate of lead : sulphuretted
hydrogen and carbonic acid gases are therefore constituents of the mixture.
But there is not a trace of the vapours of sulphuret of carbon in the gas, for
the gas thus purified does not in the least degree smell of sulphuret of carbon,

being in fact quite destitute of smell.

   The gases evolved from iron furnaces must contain nitrogen, in addition
to those described, for this gas enters with the air supplied by the blast. The
preceding investigations show us that the gases from furnaces contain the

following constituents :

        1. Nitrogen.

        2. Ammonia.
        3. Carbonic acid.
        4. Carbonic oxide.
        5. Light carburetted hydrogen.

   8. Hydrogen.

   9. Sulphuretted hydrogen.
 10. Aqueous vapour.

An iron furnace must be viewed as an apparatus destined to carry on

chemical processes of the most various kind. These operations begin at the

top of the furnace, and stretch downwards to its hearth in well-defined suc-

cession. The final products of all these operations appear partly at the hearth

and partly at the mouth ; in the latter in the form of a column of combustible

gas, in the former in the liquid form of slag and cast iron. The nature of

the combustible gas stands in a relation so intimate to the changes suffered

by the materials put into the furnace, that its different composition in the

various regions of the furnace indicates the changes suffered by the materials

introduced as they descend in their way to the entrance of the blast. Now as

the examination of this column of air in its various heights in the furnace

must be the key to the questions upon which the theory and practice of the

manufacture of iron depend, it is of the first importance to subject it to a

rigid examination. The successive changes suffered by the column of gas

in its passage can only be elucidated by a direct examination of its com-

Weposition in the various regions of the furnace.  can however employ a

method to ascertain the average composition of the gas escaping from the

mouth of the furnace ; for although tlie method does not give the compo-

sition itself, it enables us to fix the narrow limits between which it varies.

In order, however, to understand the part played by the coal itself in the

formation of gas from the furnace, it is necessary to examine closely the

phaenomena which would ensue were the furnace filled with nothing else ex-

cept the fuel. On this account we must recapitulate the results obtained
in an inquiry formerly instituted in Germany by one of us, as this may

be considered established by the repetition of the experiments by others, and

by the numerous appliances to practice which have already resulted from

them. It was shown by these experiments, which receive renewed confir-

mation and extension from our present inquiry,

1st. That the oxygen introduced by the blast is burned in the immediate

vicinity of the tuyere
                                                                                              ;
   2nd. That the oxygen is converted into carbonic oxide also in the imme-

diate vicinity of the tuyere ; and finally,

3rd. That the coal loses all its gaseous products of distillation much above

the point at which its combustion commences.

It is therefore clear that the gasification of the coal, if such a term be ad-

missible, must take place in the regular course of the furnace, at two points

quite separated from each other. At a certain depth from the mouth of

the furnace the gases due to the distillation or coaking of the coal must

escape. Further down in the furnace the gasification will be completed, be-

cause the coal freed from its volatile products must here enter into combus-

tion. These products of distillation and combustion, mixed with the nitrogen

of the atmospheric air, forms the column of gas which appears as a combus-

tible gas at the mouth of the furnace. Now when we consider that the

quantity of coal which loses its gases in traversing the distillatory part of the

furnace must correspond to that burnt before the tuyere by the air intro-

duced in the blast, it follows that the composition of the gases evolved from

the furnace will be given if we add the products of distillation of any given
--158 REPORT 1845.

quantity of coal to the products of combustion of the coke formed from that

coal.

   As no further experiments are required to determine the products of com-

bustion, the question as to the constitution of gases evolved from coal fur-
naces is reduced to the examination of the liquid and gaseous products re-
sulting from the distillation of any given kind of coal. These products will
be very different, according as they come in contact with the red-hot coal,
or escape without passing over it. In the last case we obtain the immediate
products resulting from the decomposition of coal, while in the first we have
the products arising from their action upon it. The conditions essential to
the production of the first case are more or less combined in furnaces in which
the materials are put in in a finely-divided state, and go slowly down from the
top to the bottom of the furnace. Under these circumstances the coal be-
comes heated pretty equably throughout its entire mass by the larger heating
surface which it offers to the ascending column of gas ; and the tar conden-
sing in the upper parts of the furnace is carried away by this stream of air,
before the coals saturated with it reach that point in the furnace where the

temperature is sufficient for the further decomposition of the products^ of di-

stillation. The gases generated from the furnace, under such conditions, must

contain a smaller quantity of combustible matter. It is therefore of import-
ance to determine the average composition of the gases formed from the
products of distillation unmixed with the substances-arising from their ac-

tion upon the red-hot coal. The composition of a gaseous mixture of this
kind is also interesting, because it points out the limits to which the quan-
tity of combustible constituents in furnace gases may be reduced. In order
to obtain gases of this kind, the most convenient way is to fill a combustion-
tube with the coal to be examined, which is placed in a horizontal layer
and heated from the closed end of the tube to the open end, so that the gases
are not obliged to traverse over red-hot coal in their escape from the tube.
The apparatus used by us in the determination of the liquid and gaseous
products of distillation is drawn in fig. 4. a a is a common combustion fur-
nace, in which is placed the tube coating the coal. The tube is made of
difficultly fusible green glass, about f inch wide, and surrounded by a
thin sheet of copper containing between it and the glass a layer of powdered
charcoal, so that the weight may not alter during the heating. The end of
the tube is drawn out before the flame of the blowpipe, and connected by
means of a weighed strong caoutchouc tube with the receiver b, which is
destined to receive the tar and ammoniacal water : c is a bent tube filled with
chloride of calcium for the double purpose of retaining the water and am-
monia which passes over with the gases : </ is a Liebig's tube filled with a
solution of oxide of lead in caustic potash, behind which is placed another
tube filled with chloride of calcium for the reception of the aqueous vapour
carried off from the potash. This arrangement enables us to determine the
amount of sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid, each of which is de-
termined by boiling the black precipitate in a platinum vessel with caustic
potash, and then weighing the precipitate thus freed from carbonate of lead.
The receiver filled with perchloride of antimony (/) serves for the deter-

mination of defiant gas and the volatile hydi'ocarbons accompanying it. On

account of the great volatility of this compound of chlorine, it is necessary
to connect it with a potash apparatus {g), which itself is connected with an
absorbing tube containing sulphuric acid. As the chloride of antimony is
apt to become hot during the condensation, and thus cause an escape of a
volatile chlorinated hydrocarbon, we prefer to use an alcholic instead of an
 aqueous solution of potash. If this be neglected, subchloride of mercury is

sometimes observed in the succeeding eudiometric analyses. The gases pro-

cured after this treatment, consisting of hydrogen, light carburetted hydro-
gen and carbonic oxide, are entirely destitute of smell, and without action

upon mercury. As soon as all the atmospheric air is expelled from the ap-
paratus, which we find by analysis to be effected by the distillation of about
300 grains of coal, the conducting tube (k) is dipped under mercury and the

gas collected. In order to have it of average composition, the gas is col-
lected over mercury in a glass vessel, of a capacity of 800 to 1000 cubic cen-

timetres.

   The glass tubes conveying the gas into the vessel is connected with the rest
of the apparatus by means of a caoutchouc joint, and a tube, rather narrowed
in the middle. This contracted tube is fused when the receiver is filled,
but immediately opened again with a pair of tongs in that part which still
remains in contact with the system of absorption, so that the experiment may
be continued until the coal ceases to yield gas. As soon as this point is at-
tained, the fire is removed from the combustion furnace, and the distillatory
tube opened by cutting away with a diamond its drawn-out neck, so far as it
is filled with coal-tar. The part of the absorptive system formerly in con-
nection with the mercurial apparatus is now attached to a hand air-pump,
and the apparatus filled with atmospheric air by a few gentle strokes of the
pump. The loss in weight of the distillatory tube, after being filled with air,
adding the weight of the part cut off, gives the amount of coal left behind
by the distillation, and also the total weight of the liquids and gases which
have escaped from the coal. The quantity of fluid matter is determined by
the weight of the receivers b, c, and by the loss in weight of the fragment of
glass tube when freed from tar. The receivers d, e give the quantity of car-
bonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, the receiver f,g,h the weight of the
defiant gases and condensable hydrocarbons. By subtracting the weight of
these collected products of distillation from the loss sustained by the distil-

latory tube, the remainder indicates the weight of the non-condensable gases,
the composition of which in hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen and carbonic
oxide, is easily determined by a eudiometric analysis.

   The amount of tar produced by the distillation may be determined by

throwing the contents of the first receiver on a weighed filter moistened with
water, washing it, and, after drying both it and the moist receiver, the weight
of these, added to that of the tar in the cut fragment of tube, gives a very
exact result as to its amount. The ammonia contained in the water is
best obtained by distilling it with a large excess of potash into a receiver
containing muriatic acid, until at least two-thirds of the liquid have passed
over, and it is then collected in the usual way by evaporation and precipi-
tation with chloride of platinum, the washing of the double salt being best
effected by a mixture of alcohol and JEther, according to Varrentrapp and
Wills' recommendation. The amount of water is of course known by de-
ducting the weight of the tar and ammonia from the total weight.

    In order to draw conclusions as to the composition of the gases of the fur-
nace, it is of importance to ascertain the composition of those absorbed by
the perchloride of antimony. To determine this point, a quantity of coal
was heated to redness with the precautions already described, and collected
in a gasometer filled with milk of lime. This gas, carefully dried by passing
over chloride of calcium, was led into perchloride of antimony until the

latter was saturated. An indefinite quantity of the black liquid thus ob-

tained was put into a combustion-tube with oxide of copper, the front part of
the tube being supplied with copper shavings, and on combustion, 0*1226
water and 0*3626 carbonic acid were obtained, which correspond to

   This result agrees so closely with the composition of olefiant gas, that we
may calculate the hydrocarbon as that gas, especially as any fault, arising
from so doing in the case of gases from furnaces, would be appreciable only
in the fourth decimal place. Gasforth coal, analysed in the manner now

described, gave the following results :                        grms.

    These results enable us to determine the composition of the furnace-gases.
It is clear that the 68'92 per cent, of carbon found in the analysis will be

converted by the blast into carbonic oxide above the tuyere. As we have
already seen that the coal loses its gases by distillation near the top of the
furnace, a corresponding weight of coiie must burn before the tuyere, and
hence we require only to add to the composition of the furnace-gases the
carbonic oxide produced by the combustion of 68*92 per cent, of carbon and

the nitrogen of the air expended in the combustion. This calculation gives

                                                 100-000

   If we calculate, with reference to these circumstances, and according to
volume, the composition of the gases escaping from a furnace filled with Gas-
forth coal, we obtain

           Nitrogen                              62-423
           Carbonic oxide

   The result thus obtained affords a very simple means of determining the
influence exerted upon the composition of furnace-gases by the. gaseous pro-

ducts of distillation of the coal. If Ave suppose the coal to be freed from its
volatile products, and exposed to the action of a stream of air in a furnace,
a volume of air containing 62-423 nitrogen will be converted by the influence
of the red-hot coal into a gaseous mixture of the following composition :

           Nitrogen                         62-423
           ....Carbonic oxide
                                            32-788

Accordingly, we obtain a gaseous mixture

In these calculations we have neglected the influence exerted on the com-

position of the products of combustion by the gases escaping from the iron

ore and limestone. Of course this must differ according to the quantities of

materials used in the furnaces, and we therefore select as a basis for the cal-

culation the iron furnaces of Alfreton, belonging to Mr. Oakes, the dimen-

Wesions of which are given in fig. 6.  proceed on the supposition that the

carbonic acid of the limestone and the oxygen of the ore are separated as

carbonic acid. The coal used in the furnace was subjected to distillation

with the precautions already described, and the composition thus obtained

gives us the limits to which the combustible constituent of the gases from

the furnace might be deteriorated under the most unfavourable conditions.

The 67-228 carbon in the above analysis must escape altogether as car-

bonic oxide, if a part of it were not converted into carbonic acid at the ex-

pense of the oxygen of the iron ore. In order to determine the quantity of
carbonic acid thus produced, we must refer to the details of the Alfreton

iron-works, in which the following materials are used for the production of

--140 lbs. of pig-iron :

420 lbs. calcined iron ore; 390 lbs. coal; 170 lbs. limestone.

According to the above experiment, 100 parts of the coal used give 67-228

of coke ; but this quantity of coke does not correspond exactly to that of the

carbonic oxide formed during its combustion. It is necessary before calcu-

lating this to deduct the amount of ashes contained in the coal, and the fol-

lowing analysis of the Furnace-coal of Alfreton gives us the data for the cal-

culation :

                    ........Carbon             74-83
                                                 5-10
                    Hydrogen

                    Oxygen                     9-71

                    Nitrogen                   0*18

                    Hygrometric water          7*50

                    Ashes                      2-68

                                               100-00

As the 2-68 of ashes must be deducted from the 67-228 of coke, the latter

corresponds to 64-548 of pure carbon. Part of this carbon however enters

into combination with the iron, and is thus withdrawn from combustion. If

we take, according to the analysis of Bromeis t, 3-3 per cent, as the average
amount of carbon in cast iron, there must be 1*18 subtracted from the 64*548

of carbon, because the proportion of iron produced to coal used is 35-8 : 100.

If we conceive the remainder 63-368 carbon to be burnt with air to carbonic

oxide, we obtain as the product of combustion a mixture of

                    Nitrogen            285-100
                    ....Carbonic oxide
                                        147-858

Of this 147-858 carbonic oxide, part is converted into carbonic acid at the
expense of the oxygen in the iron ore. The quantity of cast iron produced

from 100 of coal is 35-8, and corresponds to 34-62 of pure iron, for the re-

duction of which 14-83 oxygen must have been given over to the carbonic

oxide gas. By this means 25-952 of the latter would be converted into 40*782

   * The ammonia escaping witli the gases out of the condensed alcoholic water is neglected

in this calculation.

of carbonic acid. The quantity of limestone added to 100 of coal is 43'59.

This limestone consists, according to our analysis, of

                    Lime                           54<'4

We must therefore introduce into the calculation, that 18'7 of carbonic

acid are evolved from the limestone for every 100 parts of coal. By noticing

all these observations the result is obtained, that 100 parts of coal thrown

into the mouth of the furnace is reduced to 67*228 coke, by the loss of ga-

seous matter, and that this quantity, by passing into combustion when it has

descended to the tuyere, produces a gas which, mixed with the nitrogen of

the air and the carbonic acid from the limestone, passes back to the mouth

of the furnace in the form of a gas consisting of

                    Nitrogen                       282-860

From the numbers given in I. we may compare the proportion of the heat

realized in the furnace during the process with that which escapes in the
form of useful combustible matter.

And therefore out of 100 of the gases, 88374 units of heat are generated.
   The units of heat, 88374, may be considered as the measure of the quanti-

ties of heat capable of being realized by the combustion of the furnace-gases.
In order to find the proportion of the fuel actually realized in the furnace to
that lost, we have only to calculate the units of heat produced in the furnace

itself during the development of 100 parts of the furnace-gases. The only
source of heat in the furnace is the oxidation of carbon, and this oxidation is
effected at the cost of the air introduced by the bl&st, and that of the oxygen
contained in the oxide of iron. Let us now consider the influence on the
units of heat occasioned by the combustion of the carbonic oxide at the ex-
pense of oxygen in the oxide of iron. From the posthumous results of Du-

long on the heat of combustion, it follows that the quantities of heat evolved
by the combustion of 1 lit. (61*028 cubic inches) of oxygen with iron or with
carbonic oxide is almost quite equal. The first gives 6216 and the latter
6260 units of heat. The trifling difference between these numbers is quite

within the limits of error of observation, and therefore we may draw the con-
clusion, as Ebelmen has already done, that the reduction of the oxide of iron
is without influence upon the development of heat in the furnace; for in the

reduction of the oxide of iron at the cost of the carbonic oxide a thermo-
neutrality takes place. Hence the combustion of the oxygen of the air is the
only source of heat in the furnace. It suffices to determine the amount of
oxygen which has accompanied the 59*559 nitrogen into the furnace in the

form of atmospheric air, in order to fix the amount of heat generated. The
carbonic oxide formed by the combustion of this oxygen is the only source
of heat realized in the furnace, and corresponds, as will be seen in the follow-
ing calculation, to 20001. For every 20001 units of heat realized in the
furnace, 88374 are lost by the gases which escape.

   Hence follows the remarkable conclusion, that in the furnaces of Al-
freton not less than 81*54 per cent, of the fuel is lost in the form of combus-
tible matter still fit for use, and that only 18*46 per cent, of the whole fuel

is realized in carrying out the processes in the furnace.

   The maximum temperature which might be obtained by the combustion
of the gases may easily be deduced by the following considerations. 1 kil.

(15444 grains) of the gas burned with atmospheric air gives 1*9338 kil. pro-
ducts of combustion, of the following composition and specific heat :

Nitrogen        68*016 . . 0*1859
Carbonic acid   29*896 . . 0*0661
Aqueous vapour
                  2*088 . . 0*0176

                100*000  0*2696

   If we divide the units of heat, viz. 883*74, arising from the combustion of
1 kil. of the gases, by the number resulting when the quantity of the pro-
ducts of combustion is multiplied by their specific heat (1*9338x0*2696),
we obtain for the temperature of the flame 1695°*2 C, or 3083° Fahr. It is
obvious that the gases escaping from the furnace must be of still more value
as fuel than that expressed by our calculations founded upon their compo-
sition when of minimum value. They must be of a higher value, from the

circumstance that the reaction of the liquid products of distillation on the
red-hot coals produces a number of gaseous substances which must necessarily
increase their value as fuel. The upper layers of coal, limestone and iron,
being cold, cause a condensation of the water and tar, both of which drop
back upon the red-hot coals in the inferior layers, and become partly decom-

posed into hydrogen and carbonic oxide gas ; whilst another part of the tar is
broken up into hydrogen, light carburetted hydrogen and charcoal. The
portions escaping this decomposition are condensed anew by the cold layers
above, and finally themselves suffer change. For the purpose of determining

the influence exerted by this circumstance on the composition of the gases, we

have repeated the experiment on the distillation of the coal, reversing however
the mode of heating the tube ; we began at the front part instead of the closed

end of the tube, so that the products of distillation might have to traverse

the red-hot coals, and thus sufler a similar process of decomposition to that

which they experience in iron furnaces. The ammonia in this experiment

was collected in a Liebig's condenser filled with muriatic acid, and the

gases were detained in a gasometer filled with boiled water. The determi-

nation of the other data necessary for the calculation was done as in the pre-

vious experiments, and the following results were obtained :

   This result, contrasted with that obtained when the coal was distilled so

as to prevent the products of distillation passing over the red-hot coal,
enables us to see clearly the influence exerted upon the tar and steam by the

glowing fuel. The liquid products of distillation and the coke are diminished
in quantity, and in their place we find an increase of carbonic oxide, olefiant

gas and hydrogen, arising from the carbon being oxidized at the expense of

water, and from the decomposition of tar at an elevated temperature. Now
if we calculate the composition of the furnace-gases from the principles now

laid down, we obtain the following result :

   The proportion of the substances in this mixture of gases may be viewed
as the limits to which the quantity of combustible constituents may increase,

when formed under the conditions such as those existing in the Alfreton

Weiron-works.     observe at the same time, that the increase of combustible

materials effected by the reaction of the liquid products of distillation on the

red-hot coal, principally depend upon the augmentation of hydrogen and ole-

fiant gas. If we calculate from the above numbers, according to the princi-

ples already laid down, the quantity of heat evolved in the furnace by the

formation of 100 parts by weight of the gases, and compare it with the heat
which might be derived by the combustion of these gases themselves, we

obtain the proportion 98583 : 19550, a result showing that in the Alfreton

furnaces, under favourable circumstances, only 16-55 per cent, of fuel is

realized ; while 83-45 per cent, is actually lost by escaping in the form of

inflammable gases.

1 kil. of the gas burnt with air gives 1*9290 kil. products of combustion,

which consist of

                    Nitrogen                  67-33

                    Carbonic acid             29*83

   The specific heat of the products of combustion calculated from this com-
position corresponds to 0-2740, from which it follows that the temperature of
the flame of this gas burned with air would be 1768° C, or 3214° Fahr.

   Thus then the temperature of the gases of the Alfreton furnaces is 3214°
Fahr., when generated under conditions approaching to the favourable cir-
cumstances in the furnaces themselves.

                    Theory of the Hot-Blast Furnaces.

The previous inquiries have led us to a knowledge of the average compo-

sition of the furnace-gases, as they are produced during the processes in

Weoperation in various parts of the furnace.  have endeavoured to point
                                                                         ;

out the influence exerted on the average composition of the gases by the

materials introduced into the furnace, the ultimate products of all of which

Wechanges appear at the mouth of the furnace.  now proceed to the most

important part of our inquiry by endeavouring to elucidate the nature and

mutual relation of all the processes in the reduction of iron. To obtain a

knowledge of them, it was necessary to become acquainted with the changes

suffered by the ascending column of air from the blast to the mouth of the

Wefurnace.  have collected the gases from various depths of the furnace in

the manner employed by one of us in his inquiries into the theory of German

furnaces in which charcoal is used as fuel. This method has been more

lately used by Ebelmen, with several changes which we have been compelled

to reject, because in them he introduced a source of error which vitiated his

results.

The apparatus for collecting the gases in our experiments consisted of

a system of tubes twenty-six feet in length, made of soft malleable iron.

The tube was one inch in diameter, and consisted of pieces of five feet in

length, screwed together so as to be air-tight. The depth of the tube in the

furnace was known by white marks placed at the distance of one foot, and

we found that about three of these sunk in an hour during the first part of

the experiment, although more slowly afterwards. The top part of the tube

was furnished with a lead pipe, through which the gases were conducted to

a place fit for experiment. The system of tubes was balanced by a chain

passing over a block fixed to a stout wooden upright, and fastened by chains

round the furnace. The strong heat of the flame issuing from the top of the

furnace rendered it necessary to wet the support from time to time, and this

was effected by a fire-engine placed at some distance on the platform. The

gases themselves were collected in glass tubes four inches long and | inch
wide, these tubes being drawn out at both ends and connected with each other,

and also with the lead tube, by caoutchouc joints. The pressure of the gas,

which amounted often to several inches of water, was too powerful to allow

the glass tubes to be hermetically sealed while they remained in connection

Wewith the lead pipe.  therefore found it necessary to heat the tubes so as

to expand the air to a certain extent, then to tie the caoutchouc joints, and

not to seal the tubes hermetically until they had cooled down sufficiently to

Aprevent any small explosion during the melting of the glass.  vertical sec-

tion of the furnace upon which our experiments were made is represented in

fig. 6 ; it is of the usual size of furnaces in this country, and is supplied with
air heated to 626° Fahr., 330° C. This air passes into the furnace under a

pressure of mercury of 6'75 inches, out of a nozzle of 2*73 inches in diameter.

The iron ore melted in this furnace is an aluminous sphareosiderit, which

is previously roasted so as to free it from moisture and carbonic acid, and

by this means is converted into an argillaceous peroxide of iron. The fur-

nace is supplied with eighty charges in the course of twenty-four hours

each of these charges, as we have already mentioned, consisting of 420 lbs.

of calcined ironstone, 390 lbs. of coal, and 170 lbs. of limestone, the product

of which is 140 lbs. of pig-iron. The limestone is broken up into pieces

about the size of the fist before being introduced into the furnace, but the

coal and ironstone are projected in lumps which not unfrequently weigh above

twenty pounds. Iron ore and limestone are thrown into the furnace without

Weany previous mixture.  have collected the gases in all the regions below

and above the zone of fusion, for in the latter the collection was impossible,

owing to the high temperature, which softened the tubes, or melted them

completely. Although the gases under the zone of fusion are actually at a

higher temperature than they are at that point of the furnace, we succeeded
                         --

170 REPORT 1845.

in obtaining them by boring through the Froiit over the hearth of the fur-
nace, and introducing an iron tube*.

   The gases collected over the zone of fusion were first examined, and gave

the following results :
                                                Experiment I.

   The depth of the tube was five feet below the upper stratum of fuel and
materials. The gases issuing from the tube possessed a peculiar smell dif-
ferent to that of coal-gas, but very similar to the characteristic odour of
acrolein ; they burned with a yellowish red flame, and were not accompanied
with brown vapours of tar. Number of charges, 6.

If we calculate the proportion of the nitrogen (including also that in the

cyanogen) to the oxygen contained in the gas, after subtracting a quantity
                                                                                                  which

differ only 2 per cent, from the quantity of oxygen in atmospheric air. Now

by calculating this gaseous mixture on the supposition that it does not con-
tain cyanogen and consists merely of nitrogen, carbonic oxide, carburetted

hydrogen and hydrogen, using the formulae which we have provided for such

cases, the following composition would result, which is not admissible under

the circumstances in which the gas is formed :

   Hence this calculation leads us to a composition in which nearly 2 per cent,
of light carburetted hydrogen is present, an assumption which at once proves
its inaccuracy, when we consider the point of the furnace at which the gas

was collected. A consideration of the previous analyses explains the change

suffered by the column of air in its ascent in the furnace.

of twenty-four feet in the furnace. Now as one of us has elsewhere shown that

carburetted hydrogen can neither be formed by the direct combination of

carbon with hydrogen, nor by the decomposition of water at the expense

of the coals, it must be viewed as a product of distillation, a fact of consider-

--able importance in the theory of the process of smelting in this country, and

which leads to the following conclusion, That the region of the furnace in

which the coking of the coal is effected extends to a depth of twenty-four

feet from the mouth.

   When we consider that the coals are thrown into the furnace in large

masses, sometimes 20 lbs. in weight, it will scarcely excite surprise that the

space required by the coal, before being converted entirely into coke, is above

one-half of the whole depth of the furnace.

The tabulated composition of the gases further shows that the quantity of ni-

trogen in the gaseous mixture, taken at a depth of fourteen feet, is at a minimum,

while the olefiant gas, carburetted hydrogen and hydrogen is at a maximum.
As the latter gases are formed from coal only under the influence of an ele-

Tated temperatui-e, we draw from this circumstance the conclusion, that the

process of distillation of the coal reaches its maximum at a depth of fourteen

Wefeet.  remarked, in describing the experiments in detail, that the gases

were free from the vapours of tar to a depth of fourteen feet, but that they

became richly laden with them on attaining a depth of seventeen feet. The

absence of these vapours from the upper part of the furnace proves that they

suffer decomposition as they pass through the upper layers of red-hot coal.
The water ascending through these layers must also suffer decomposition,

and this fact explains the irregularity in the proportions between the car-

bonic acid and carbonic oxide.

  When we compare with each other the different quantities of carbonic

oxide and carbonic acid at various depths of the furnace, we see a complete

absence of any mutual dependence, contrary to what was observed to be the

case in the smaller German furnaces fed with charcoal. In order to under-

stand this phsenomenon, it is necessary to consider attentively the conditions

under which the materials are exposed.

  We have already seen that the coal has to travel twenty-four feet, from

the mouth to the boshes of the furnace, before it is deprived of its volatile

carbonaceous products, hygroscopic water, and water formed by the distilla-

tion. Now even if we admit that the temperature in this part of the furnace

is never so much lowered by the uninterrupted gasification of the coal as to

prevent the reduction of the iron ore, by which carbonic oxide is converted

into carbonic acid, still the ore would always be exposed not only to the de-

oxidizing influence of the furnace-gases, but also to the oxidizing powers of

the steam evolved from the coal, which has escaped being coked. The pro-

jection of the coal into the furnace in large pieces has therefore the effect of

subjecting the ore to a simultaneous reduction and oxidation, on account of

which the relation between the carbonic acid, carbonic oxide and hydrogen

is made to depend upon local circumstances in the upper pait of the furnace.

Now when we further consider that the carbonic oxide and carbonic acid

escaping from the mouth of the furnace, and from the part superior to the

boshes, are almost in equal proportion, we are compelled to look for the
cause of reduction of the ore in a region of the furnace still deeper. How-

ever, all doubt as to this fact disappears when we refer to the proportion be-

tween the nitrogen and oxygen of the gases collected. If the reduction of

the ore and evolution of carbonic acid from the limestone had been com-
pletely effected above the point of the furnace to which we reached, the gases

formed below would have contained their nitrogen and oxygen in the same
          --

          ON THE GASES EVOLVED FKOM IRON FURNACES.  177

proportion as in air, and would not have become richer in oxygen gas. But
it will be seen that this is really not the case by the following table of the
varying proportions of oxygen and nitrogen in the gases collected from the

various depths :

Nitrogen
                         --;

--178 REPORT 1845.

    This mixture of gases contains,

   1. The products of distillation af the coal.
   2. The products of its combustion.
   3. The carbonic acid generated during the reduction of the ore, and ex-
pelled from the limestone.
   The proportion of nitrogen to oxygen, as deduced from these analyses,
is 79-2 : 27-33, and 79-2 : 26-67, or an average of 79-2 : 27. The products
of combustion of the coal give the proportion existing in atmospheric air

79*2 : 20*8. Now as the amount of oxygen in the products of distillation of
the coal is quite insignificant, and may be safely neglected in the calculation,

the increase of oxygen from 20'8 to 27 must depend upon the carbonic acid
of the limestone, and the oxygen of the ore given to carbon during the re-
duction. But the gas collected at twenty-three and twenty-four i'eet deep,
contains 27"6 and 26"5 oxygen to 79'2 nitrogen. Hence at this depth the
gas must have already accumulated all the oxygen of the iron, and the car-

--bonic acid of the limestone. These facts warrant us in drawing the follow-

ing conclusion, That in hot-blast furnaces fed with coal, the reduction of
the iron and expulsion of carbonic acid from the limestone takes place in
the boshes of the furnace.

  We cannot define by direct observation the exact region of the furnace

in which the melting of the iron and formation of the slag are effected, but as
the large masses of ironstone cannot enter the hearth in any form except as

a liquid, we may safely assume that the point of fusion is at the top of the

hearth in hot-blast furnaces.

   With the object of rendering these processes more intelligible, we have
shaded a section of the furnace so as to represent the different parts em-
ployed in their special functions, the drawing being made to an exact scale.

A DB is the space in which the distillation proceeds, B C and C show the

region in which the reduction of the ore and evolution of the carbonic acid
are effected, and in which the materials attain the temperature necessary for

fusion.

   The marked difference between the results obtained in the continental fur-
naces and those in this country will cease to excite surprise, when we bear in
mind the different nature of the fuel employed. The principal reason of the

great depression of the region of reduction in the furnaces of this country, is

that almost all the body of the furnace is taken up in the process of coking
and hence the point of reduction must be still further lowered if the pieces
of coal be of a large size. These pieces, often in bulk equal to a cubic foot,
must remain a long time before the heat penetrates thoroughly through them,
and the column of air ascending through this material must yield its heat in
order to render gaseous above 30 per cent, of the fuel. Hence the depres-
sion of the temperature of the upper half of the furnace becomes so great
that it does not suflfice for the reduction of the ore, nor is it sufiicient for
the expulsion of carbonic acid from the limestone. Another important
cause lowei'ing the region of reduction, is the high pressure at which the
blast is thrown into the furnace, the pi-essure being six or seven times the
amount of that used in Germany. The materials, on this account, traverse
through the furnace much more speedily, and therefore require to pass
through a larger space to become heated. All these circumstances have
much less influence in the German and Swedish furnaces. The charcoal
with which the latter are fed is a fuel almost completely coked, and the ma-
terials, being in small fragments and thoroughly mixed, offer a heating sur-
face at least a hundred times greater than that exposed in English furnaces.
ON THE GASES EVOLVED FROM IRON FURNACES.  179

The small pressure of the blast also effects a slow combustion, so that the

fuel frequently takes twice or three times the jDeriod to pass through the
same region of the furnace.

            On the application of Furnace- Gases to practical purposes.

   In this division of the subject we have to consider the useful purposes to
which these gases may be applied when employed as fuel. Their practical
value does not so much depend on the amount of heat capable of being ge-
nerated by their combustion, as upon their maximum temperature ; and both
these conditions may be exhibited by examining the composition of the vari-
ous mixtures of gases obtained from different depths in the furnace. But it
would be erroneous to suppose that the values thus obtained by calculation

expressed in all cases the average practical effects capable of being derived

by their application on the large scale, for such a conclusion would only be
justifiable when the numbers obtained by analyses expressed the average
value. That this is not the case has been shown in the above considerations
as to the proportion between the nitrogen and oxygen, for we observed at the
depth of fourteen feet, when the gases were richest in combustible materials,
this relation was the least observed. Even in the highest layer of the
gaseous mixture, the constituents of which may be viewed as most intimately
mixed, we obtain a combustible value more than one-third greater than the
above, when we estimate it according to the composition of the materials
thrown into the furnace, and the products of distillation of the coal. In
order, therefore, to found our calculations on a firm basis, we will estimate
the practical value of the gases according to the results obtained in our
former calculations, as to the limits of variation in the value of the gases,
when deduced from the composition of the materials with which the furnace
is supplied. This mode of proceeding will safelj lead us to numbers ex-
pressing the average value, and will enable us to repose upon them with
confidence, from the assurance that the results capable of being obtained on
the large scale, must be much greater than those expressed by calculation.

   Our experiments have proved the combustibility of the entire column of gas,
even when cold, from a depth of twenty-four feet to the mouth of the furnace.
Hence it follows that the gas collected from any point to this depth is capable
of being applied as fuel. It would be objectionable, however, to conduct the
gas from a deep region of tiie furnace, because we should thus draw off the
heat necessary to support the process of coking the coal in its upper part.
The gas might be collected from the upper part of the furnace without any de-
triment to the process, and with additional advantage as fuel, because, while it
contains all the combustible products of distillation, it is not deteriorated by
having taken up any incombustible ingredients. This circumstance greatly
facilitates the application of the combustible gases, for it removes the obstacle

to their use in furnaces fed with charcoal. In the latter, the zones of distilla-
tion and reduction lie more closely together, and the proportion of ore and

limestone to the coal is so much greater than in this country, that the amount

of carbonic acid evolved obliges the withdrawal of the combustible gases
from a low region of the furnace, where the reduction of the ore and evolu-
tion of carbonic acid have been completed. But the withdrawal of the gaseous
fuel from a region below that of the reduction necessarily produces such
disturbance in the operations of the furnace, that only a small part of these
gases dare be removed, while the largest portion must still be allowed to re-

main and administer to its necessities. The advantage to be derived from
the use of the gaseous fuel in this country will therefore be the more obvious,
when we consider that its apolication cannot derange any of the processes

                                                                 n2

essential to the reduction and smelting of the ore. In furnaces fed with char-
coal, the gaseous fuel has been collected and applied without any great diffi-
cultj-, by building into the wall of the furnace a circular channel supplied in
the inner part with a grating so as to prevent its obstruction by the materials
introduced into the furnace. The gases stream freely through this channel,
even though the furnace is left entirely open, and though the pressure is so
inconsiderable as scarcely to affect a water manometer. The great pressure
of blast used in English furnaces led us to the conviction that in them the
column of gas must be much more compressed, and we have confirmed this
opinion by a series of measurements on a water manometer attached to the
tube through which the gases were collected for experiment. The pres-
sure of the gases expressed by the height of the column of water at various

depths is as follows :

          5 feet  ...  0-12  inch.
          8,,
         11 ,,    ...  0-40    ,,
         14 ,,    ...           ,,
         20 ,,    ...  MO       ,,
         23 ,,    ...           ,,
         24 ,,    ...  1-60     ,,
                  ...           ,,
                       1-80

                       4-70
                       5-10

    This table proves that even in the highest portion of the gaseous column,

the pressure is considerably greater than in that region of the furnace from
which the gases are withdrawn in Germany.

   Hence it follows that hot-blast furnaces fed with coal are peculiarly well-
adapted for the economy of gaseous fuel, which may be conducted from the
furnace and applied without in any way interfering with its operations.

  We have already shown, on the very lowest calculation, that at least 81*54

per cent, of valuable fuel must escape from the mouth of the Alfreton furnace.

Now as about fourteen tons of coal are used in that furnace every twenty-four

hours, it follows, according to our experiments, that 1 1*4 tons of coal are lost

every twenty-four hours lay escaping in the form of gases still capable of

being used as excellent fuel.

  We have previously shown, that the temperature capable of being attained

by the combustion of these gases is 3083° Fahr. (1695°*2 C), and, by using a
blast sufficiently heated, this could easily be raised to 3632° Fahr. (2000° C).

Now as Pouillet has shown that cast iron melts at 2192° Fahr. (1200° C), it

follows that the gases of hot-blast furnaces fed with coal, when burned with
hot air, would yield a temperature more than sufficient to melt iron.

The gases of our furnaces fed with coal contain a very valuable consti-

tuent, which is entirely absent from the charcoal furnaces of the continent.

This substance is ammonia, which is present in such abundance, as to be

sensible to the smell in the gases collected from the deeper parts of the fur-

Wenace.  have therefore devoted our special attention to this valuable in-

gredient, and have arrived at the conclusion that it is possible to economise

it in the most simple manner. The ammonia may be obtained in the form

of sal-ammoniac, if the gas previous to its application as fuel be conducted

through a chamber containing muriatic acid. In collecting the ammonia in

this manner, there need be little fear of any considerable deposition of tar,

for the product of distillation flows back upon red-hot coal, and is so com-

pletely decomposed, that the tube, thirty feet long, used by us for a period of

twelve hours in collecting the gases, scarcely contained a trace of tar, although

its temperature was not sensibly higher than that of the surrounding air.
ON THE GASES EVOLVED FROM IRON FURNACES.                           181

If the solution of sal-asrimoniac produced by the condensation of the am-

monia be allowed to flow into an evaporating pan, over the surface of which

a small part of the flame of the combustible gas is allowed to play, a conve-

nient arrangement of the liquid and of the burning stream of gas would en-

able us to obtain a constant flow of a concentrated solution of sal-ammoniac

as an auxiliary in the manufacture. The advantage of its collection is, that

without any further consumption of fuel, or any considerable expenditure of

labour, a valuable commercial ingredient would be economised. Hence it is

of importance to estimate how much ammonia we might hope to obtain in

this way ; and this is easily determined by the quantity generated during the

Wedistillation of coal.  have subjected the furnace-coal of Alfreton to

various trials, both by distilling it per se, and along with a mixture of soda
and lime, and then by separating the ammonia in the usual way from the

liquid products of distillation by means of chloride of platinum.

I. 2-887 furnace-coal of Alfreton, heated with soda and lime, yielded

O'OSOl chloride of platinum and ammonia.

   II. The experiment repeated with 5'687 coal gave 01 75 chloride of plati-
num and ammonium.

III. 20*455 grms. distilled per se, gave a product collected in muriatic acid,

which, after separation of the tar, yielded 0'7681 chloride of platinum and
ammonium.

  --Hence 100 parts of the furnace-coal of Alfreton yields the following quan-

tities of sal-ammoniac :

I. Experiment                ...             0*666
                                             0-739
II                           ...             0-902

III.                     ,,

                         Mean .... 0-769

Now, as 280 cwt.of coal are consumed in the Alfreton furnace every twenty-

four hours, it follows that more than 2 cwt. sal-ammoniac might be obtained

from it as a subsidiary product, without increasing the cost of manufacture, or

in the slightest degree disturbing the process of smelting.

  We have confined ourselves in this examination principally to the con-

sideration of the furnace-coal of Alfreton, but we may naturally expect con-

siderable differences as to the amount of nitrogen in other coals used in this

and in other countries. The estimation of the nitrogen, with regard to the

possibility of applying the ammonia generated by their distillation, thus be-

Wecomes a question of considerable importance.      therefore reserve for

ourselves the prosecution of this inquiry in a succeeding paper. Before

leaving this subject, however, we have to allude to some experiments, show-

ing the facility of condensing the ammonia.

As the gases from the upper parts of the furnace are saturated with aque-

ous vapour, which condenses along with the ammonia in the lead tube with

which they were collected, we have taken the proportion of the ammonia

carried away in the gases, so as to compare it with that which had sufiered

condensation. For this purpose, the gases flowing through the iron and lead

pipes, sunk from eight to ten and a half feet beneath the charging-plate,

determined the volume of the gas passing through the acid by collecting it at

various times during the experiment in a balloon made of gold-beater's skin,

of the capacity of 380-8 cubic inches, observing the time which was re-
quired to fill the balloon. The mean result, which deviated only slightly

from the individual trials, showed that the gas required 1' 7" to fill the bal-

loon, and therefore that 43304;"76 cubic inches have jDassed through the mu-

riatic acid. The examination of the muriatic acid used in the experiment

gave 0*198 grm. chloride of platinum and ammonium, corresponding to

0"0152 ammonia. If we assume as the composition of the gases that formed

at a depth of eight feet, we can easily calculate the quantity of coal necessary

to produce the above 43304'"76 cubic inches of gas. According to analysis,

1000 cubic centimetres of this gas contain 54'7'7 cubic centimetres of nitro-

Wegen.  have already seen that nitrogen is not produced from the materials

introduced into the furnace, and hence all the amount present must have

been introduced by the blast as atmospheric air, which, burning before the

tuyere, mixed with the gaseous products of distillation in the upper parts of

the furnace, and produced the above 54-7*7 cubic centimetres of nitrogen.

But as this amount of nitrogen is derived from atmospheric air, it implies that

MS'Si cubic centimetres, or 0"2066 grm. of oxygen has been consumed in

the lower part of the furnace by uniting with 0*1549 grm. of coke, in the

formation of carbonic oxide. But, as has already been shown by a previous

experiment, 0*2304 grm. of coal must have been distilled to produce the

0*1549 grm. of coke ; and as the above quantity of coal is required to gene-

rate one litre of the above gaseous mixture, 163*5 grm. must have been em-

ployed in the generation of the 43304 cubic inches of gas washed by the

muriatic acid. Hence it follows that only 0*0093 grm., or 3'77 per cent, of

the ammonia generated from 100 parts of the coal (which according to our

experiments amounts to 0*2463 grm.) pass over along with the gases ; so that

the remaining 0*2370 grm., or 96*23 per cent, of ammonia, must have been

condensed in the water of distillation found in the tube. In fact we ascer-

tained that the lead tube contained a clear liquid so strongly charged with

ammonia as instantly to render blue reddened litmus paper held over it.

These experiments prove how easily the ammonia might be condensed, even

without the intervention of an acid.

It will be observed that the gases from the inferior parts of the furnace

contain cyanogen, the presence of which is highly interesting, not only in a

theoretical, but also in a practical point of view. This gas appears imme-

diately over the point of entrance of the blast, and again disappears at a

small elevation above it, so that at the top of the boshes only traces of it are

observed. The compound of this substance M'ith potassium appears to play

a most important part in the furnace, although its functions have apparently

been altogether overlooked. This is the more surprising, as it has long been

known that cyanide of potassium effloresces on the walls in certain states of

Wethe furnace.  have been fortunate enough to elucidate tlie conditions of

its formation and to fix its region in the furnace. In obtaining information

with regard to the formation of this cyanogen gas, it M-as necessary to with-

draw the gases from the vicinity of the hearth of the furnace, and through

the kindness of Mr. Oakes we were enabled to bore a hole over the Front of

the furnace two feet nine inches above the level of the tuyere. As soon as

this hole was made a gas issued from it possessing strong illuminating powers,

and burning with a yellow flame, from which came abundant vapours of white

smoke. On introducing an iron pipe into the hole, without allowing it to

pass into the furnace, it was retained sufficiently cool to prevent its fusion,
and we were enabled to collect the volatile products. The gases which poured

out of this tube under a pressure of several feet of water were so richly laden

with vapours of cyanide of potassium, that we were obliged to use precautions

in approaching its opening, so as not to suifer injurious consequences from

this poisonous material. Although the conducting-tube was twenty-two feet

in length, the amount of cyanide of potassium carried along with the gas was

SO considerable as to fill in a very short time glass tubes of one-eighth of an

inch in width, and we therefore endeavoured to obtain an approximative result

as to the amount which thus passed over with the gases and escaped con-

densation in the long tube. The opening of the iron tube was connected

with an empty Wolf's-bottle, to which another was attached containing water,

in such a manner that the gas had to stream througii a layer of four inches of

the latter. The first of these bottles became quickly filled with a rich white

sublimate of dry cyanide of potassium, while the water in the second became

a tolerably concentrated solution of the same substance. It was now neces-

sary to determine tha quantity of gas which passed through the bottles, and

this we ascertained by accurately noting the time employed in the experi-

ment and the exact period necessary to fill a balloon of known capacity

attached to the second bottle.

1. Duration of the experiment, 24 minutes;

2. Mean time required to fill the balloon, 25 seconds

3. Capacity of the balloon, 380*8 cubic inches.

   Hence it follows that 21933 cubic inches of gas passed through the bottle.
The cyanide of potassium in the Wolf's-bottles and their connecting tubes

were made into one solution, which weighed 381 "024 grms., and 129"211 grms.

of this solution yielded 0*62208 grm. cyanide of silver, which was easily de-

composed by fuming sulphuric acid. Hence, in the 21933 cubic inches of

gas which had passed througii the flasks, there must have been 0'8944' grm.

Weof cyanide of potassium held in mechanical suspension.      have already

seen that the gas possessed the following composition :

Nitrogen                                         58*05

Carbonic oxide . · . . . 37*4-3

Hj'drogen                                        3*18

                                                 100*00

The 21933 cubic inches of gas, admitting only its approximative estima-

tion, its temperature being neglected, must contain 1192*97 grains of carbon,

corresponding to 1774*79 grains of coal. Hence out of 100 parts of coal, at

least 0"778 of cyanide of potassium are generated; and as 31200 pounds

of coal are consumed every day in the furnace, it is obvious that at least

224*7 lbs. of cyanide of potassium are generated daily in the Alfreton fur-

nace and hitherto have been altogether lost.

When the iron tube used in the experiment was withdrawn from the fur-

nace, it was found to be encrusted with melted cj'anide of potassium, which

speedily deliquesced in the air. On bringing it in contact with water, a con-

siderable quantity of hydrogen gas was evolved, obviously due to the pre-

sence of reduced potassium, or to its compound with cai-bonic oxide. In

the tube itself at least three or four times the amount of cyanide of potassium

was condensed, so that we may be quite certain that the amount formed is

far more considerable than we have stated. With these unexpected results

before us, it became of importance to determine the origin of the large quan-

tity of potassium in the furnace. At first we conceived that it might be

present in the limestone, which not unfrequently contains carbonate of potash,

according to the researches of various chemists; but on examining as much

as 30 grammes, Ave were unable to detect in it the smallest trace. However,

we were informed by Mr. Charles Oakes that he had detected the presence

of potash in the iron ore, and we are glad to be able to confirm the result of

Wethis talented young chemist.  have subjected an average sample of the

calcined ore to analj'sis, according to the methods usually employed in such
cases. The quantity used in the analysis was 2"324 grras,, which yielded
1-400 peroxide of iron, 0*153 alumina, ()-145 carbonate of lime, 0-202 phos-
phate of magnesia, and 0*599 silica. In order to estimate the amount of
potash, 17-936 grms. were ignited with carbonate of barytes, dissolved in mu-
riatic acid, and the bases, after separation of the silica, were as much as pos-
sible precipitated by carbonate of ammonia. The solution was then freed
from barytes by means of sulphuric acid, and the excess of the latter removed
by evaporation with chloride of strontium. In this way the remaining bases
were converted into chlorides soluble in alcohol, and the solution mixed with
chloride of platinum and evaporated to dryness in the water-bath left a resi-

due, which, treated with alcohol to dissolve out the other chlorides, consisted
of pure chloride of platinum and potassium, and weighed 0*689 grm. This

analysis gives the following composition for the calcined ore :

           Silica            ....  25-775
                                   60*242
           Peroxide of iron
           Alumina                   6*583

           Manganese

                                   100*000

   Another source of the potash was found to be in the coal, although to a
less extent than in the ore: 1*627 grm. of the coal, dried at 212°, yielded
0*122 grm. of water; 0*2865 grm. gave 0*7865 grm. of carbonic acid and
0*153 grm. of water ; 2*887 grms., heated with the mixture of soda and lime,
gave 0*0801 of chloride of platinum and ammonium. The experiment, re-
peated with 5-687 grms. gave 0-175 of the above salt; 13-059 grms. of coal
yielded 0*3505 grm. of ashes, which did not effervesce with acids ; and this
quantity of ashes, treated as in the case of the iron ore, gave 0*046 grm. of
chloride of platinum and potassium. The coal therefore is composed as

follows :

           Carbon                  74*98
           Hydrogen                  4*73

           Oxygen                  10*01
           Nitrogen                 0-18
           Water                    7-49

           Silicates               2*61
                                   0*07
           Potash

                                                                                   100*00

   The quantity of ironstone consumed by the furnace every twenty-four hours
is 33600 lbs., and tliat of coal 31200 lbs., so that the furnace receives every
day in these materials 271*48 lbs. of potash, corresponding to 377*3 lbs. of
cyanide of potassium. Thus these analyses render intelligible the large
quantity of potash which we observed in the inferior parts of the furnace.

   But we have yet to discuss the most interesting and important question bear-
ing upon the presence of cyanide of potassium, viz. the origin of its cyanogen.

We know how easily ammonia in contact with carbon at high temperatures

is converted into cyanide of ammonium. Hence we should be apt at once
to admit that the formation of cyanogen is due to the ammonia so freely
evolved from the coal during its distillation ; and if this view were correct,
ON THK GASES EVOLVED FROM lEON FURNACES.               185

the existence of one must arise from the destruction of the other. But when

we view more closely the circumstances under which the cyanogen is pro-

duced, we are compelled to admit that the ammonia cannot take part in its

formation. The hearth, at which the formation of cyanogen takes place, is

the deepest and hottest part of the furnace, and it would be absurd to

suppose that the coal which reaches this part could contain a trace of am-

monia, exposed as it has been for eighty hours to a red heat, and in one

part to a temperature sufficient to reduce potash. Hence we are compelled

to adopt the only remaining conclusion, that the nitrogen of the air intro-

duced by the blast combines directly with carbon to form cyanogen. This

direct formation has been argued for by various chemists, and supported in

this country by the experiments of Fownes and Young. But as it has been

objected to experiments of this kind, that they were instituted without refer-

ence to the ammonia of the air, which is apt to be taken by most substances

exposed to it, it is scarcely to be wondered at that the direct generation of

Weammonia is still doubted by distinguished chemists.  have therefore

thought it necessary to determine this disputed question by an experiment

Wewhich seems to banish all sources of error.  have led simultaneously, and

under exactly the same conditions, a stream of carbonic acid and another of

nitrogen, at a very high temperature, over a mixture of two parts of charcoal

from sugar and one part of chemically pure carbonate of potash, and have

subjected the products to careful examination. The apparatus used by us

in these experiments is represented in fig. 9 : a is a gasometer, from which a
uniform stream of air is made to pass through a bottle filled with sulphuric

acid (b), and then through a gun-barrel (c c) filled with copper turnings.

The gun-barrel is kept in a furnace, so that the air passing through it is

thoroughly deprived of oxygen and passes into the gun-barrel (d d) filled with

the mixture of charcoal and potash, and heated to a temperature sufficient

to reduce potassium. In the same furnace is placed another gun-barrel (e e),

filled with the same mixture, and over which is passed a stream of dry car-

bonic acid from the apparatus/^. When both the systems were completely

filled, one with nitrogen, the other with carbonic acid, the streams of gas were

allowed to pass slowly over the mixture of potash and charcoal, both the

tubes in the same furnace being kept at a temperature sufficient to reduce

potassium. The gas passing out of the tube filled with carbonic acid had all

the characters of pure carbonic oxide, being transparent, inodorous, and

burning with a pale blue flame, without depositing any kind of sublimate.

The tube over which nitrogen passed emitted a gas richly laden with a white

smoke of cyanide of potassium, which sublimed in such quantity as to stop

the conducting-tube. When the nitrogen was passed so slowly through the

sulphuric acid that the bubbles passed only once in a second, its absorption

by the potash was complete, and no gas appeared at the mouth of the gun-

barrel ; but as soon as the temperature was lowered, so as to be under that

necessary for the reduction of potassium, the absorption of nitrogen ceased.

The contents of the tube over which carbonic acid had passed were examined

after cooling without the detection of the smallest trace of cyanide of potas-

sium. The mixture treated with nitrogen, on the other hand, dissolved (with

the exception of its charcoal) with a very powerful odour of hydrocyanic

acid. The solution exhibited all the reactions of cyanide of potassium, and

yielded 6*982 grms. of cyanide of silver, which dissolved (with decomposition)

in fuming sulphuric acid without leaving any residue of chloride of silver after

--being diluted with water. Hence we cannot for a moment demur to the fol-

lowing conclusion, That a considerable quantity of cyanide of potassium is

formed in iron furnaces immediately above the point where the blast comes
186 REPORT--- 1845.

in contact with the glowing fuel, and that it owes its formation to a direct union

of carbon with potassium and nitrogen of the air.
   Our experiments have further shown that cyanide of potassium is volatile

at high temperatures, and this property is of much influence in the part wliich
it takes in the reducing process of the furnace. Carried up by the ascending

current of gas, the cyanide of potassium, partly in a state of vapour, partly
as a solid, reaches the region of the furnace in which the reduction is effected,
and here it exerts its well-known reducing power. In consequence of this
it is decomposed into nitrogen, carbonic acid, and carbonate of potash, the
former of which passes up with the ascending gaseous column to the mouth

of the furnace, while the latter, not being volatile, falls back with the other
materials in the furnace to that point where it is again converted into cyanide
of potassium, under the influence of the carbon and nitrogen. Hence a large

quantity of ore may in this way be reduced in the lower part of the furnace,
by comparatively a small quantity of regenerated cyanide of potassium. The

importance of this view of the part played by cyanide of potassium, although
previously entirely neglected, will be seen when we consider that this power-

ful reducing agent must accumulate in the furnace to a considerable extent.
The region of the furnace where the highest temperature prevails forms a
limited space, beyond which the cyanide of potassium cannot extend to the
lower parts of the furnace until its quantity is so much increased by the pot-

ash descending in the materials supplied that the excess of cyanide of potas-
sium escapes volatilization and reaches the blast, where it is burnt and con-

verted into nitrogen, carbonic acid and carbonate of potash, the basis of M-hich

Weunites with the slag.     have already shown that the relation of the nitro-

gen to the oxygen in the gaseous mixture, collected only two and a half feet

over the tuyere, is 79'2 : 22'8, after deducting a quantity of oxj'gen corre-

sponding to the hydrogen. If the gas generated at this place contained only

the  nitrogen  and  oxygen  due  to  the  air,  the  proportion  would  be  79'2  :  20*8
                                                                                                          ;

and hence it follows that the gases at this point must either have obtained

oxygen from a source independent of the air, or that a proportion of nitrogen

has been abstracted from them. Any one who has had the opportunity of

observing the temperature of the furnace at this part will at once agree with

the opinion that the excess of oxygen cannot be derived from the carbonic

Aacid or iron ore.  simple inspection of the materials enables us to reject

such an explanation as erroneous, for the fused materials flowing from the fur-

nace do not evolve gas, although they come from a point in the immediate

vicinity of that where the oxygen has been taken up.

  We must therefore admit that this phsenomenon is connected with the for-

mation of cyanide of potassium in the furnace. The potash, as it yields its
oxygen to carbon during its conversion to cyanide of potassium, assumes for
every volume of oxygen lost by it two volumes of nitrogen in the form of

cyanogen, and consequently the proportion of nitrogen to oxygen is neces-

sarily increased.

Report on the Ichthyology of the Seas of China and Japan. By John
   Richardson, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., ^c, Medical Inspector of

   Naval Hosjntals.

The following report is essentially a list of the fish which are known to

inhabit the waters of the Chinese empire, to which I have added the Japanese

species  that  have  been  named  in  the  ' Fauna  Japonica                                                 of  Siebold,  edited  by

Temminck and Schlegel, and now in the course of publication. The po-

sition of the southern islands of Japan, in the same parallels of latitude

with the northern coasts of China, and with only a narrow sea intervening,

would lead us to believe that the species of fish which resort to the op-

posing shores of the two kingdoms are the same, and such is the fact as

far as our evidence goes. Accurate local catalogues of animals are of much

utility to the zoologist, being indispensable instruments for eliciting the geo-

graphical distribution of forms and species; but in respect of documents of

this kind, ichthyology is far behind the other departments of natural history.

We have ample lists of the quadrupeds, birds, reptiles and plants of most of

the larger districts of the globe, but out of Europe we cannot refer to an

enumeration of the fish of any country that can be said to approach com-

pleteness, with the exception of the ichthyology of the Red sea, which has

been made known by the labours of Forskal, Ehrenberg and Riippell. The

fish of Madeira have been catalogued by the Rev. R. T. Lowe, and those of

the Canaries, collected by Webb and Bertholet, have been described in the

ichthyological part of their work by M. Valenciennes. The fish of British

India also have been extensively figured by Russell, Buchanan-Hamilton and

M'^Clelland; but much comparative examination of the species of that wide

country is still required to enable us to distinguish those which are com-

mon to other countries or districts of the ocean from those which are pecu-

liar to it. Some of the northern states also of the North American union have

very laudably caused catalogues to be formed of the animals of their respective

territories, and from the great ' Histoire des Poissons ' of Cuvier and Valen-

ciennes, we may extract lists, though by no means full ones, of the Acantho-

pterygian fish that inhabit the coasts of Brazil, the Caribbean sea, Polynesia,

and the Malay archipelago; but of the ichthyology of the extra-tropical

seas of the southern hemisphere, and of the whole I'ange of the North and

South American coast washed by the Pacific, it is almost silent. About a

score of Japanese and Chinese fish were discovered in the time of Linnseus

by Lagerstroem, Houttuyn, Osbeck and others, and a few were added by

LangsdorfF, who accompanied the Russian admiral in his voyage to the isles

of Japan and the South Sea. With these exceptions, the fish of the eastern

coasts of Asia, from the sea of Ochotsk down to Cochin China, were, till

very recently, known to European naturalists merely by drawings of native

artists, several collections of which are to be found in the British and Paris

libraries*. Within the last two years Temminck and Schlegel have com-

menced the pviblication, which we have already alluded to, of Siebold's ich-

thyological researches in Japan, and have carried on the work to the eighth

fasciculus, and through the great families of PercidcB, TriglidcB, ScicenidcBy

SparidcB and Scomberidce. Several novel and interesting forms have been

already illustrated in this important work, most of them ranging to the

southern coasts of China, and not unknown to English iclithyologists, though

published for the first time in the ' Fauna Japonica.' For upwards of fifteen

tration of the natural history of China.

years materials for an ample account of the fish of China have existed in

England. John Reeves, Esq., who was long resident at Macao, filling an

important oflice in the employ of the India Company, with an enlightened

munificence, caused beautiful coloured drawings, mostly of the natural size,

to be made of no fewer than 340 species of fish which are brought to the

markets at Canton. These drawings are executed with a correctness and

finish which will be sought for in vain in the older works on ichthyology,

and which are not surpassed in the plates of any large European work of the

present day. The unrivalled brilliancy and effect of the colouring, and cor-

rectness of profile, render them excellent portraits of the fish they are intended

to represent; but further details of a technical kind, such as the distribution

of the teeth in the roof of the mouth, the numbers of the gill-rays, and the

fine serratures and denticulations on the edges of the opercular pieces, are

required for the location of the species in their proper genera. Such minute

characters, which can be detected, in many instances, only by aid of a lens,

require to be exaggerated to be shown in a drawing, and indeed, when the

serratures of the gill-pieces were sufficiently large to be conspicuous to the

naked eye, the Chinese artist has seldom failed to represent them. Mr,

Reeves had four copies of these drawings made. One set, which he presented

to General Hardwicke, is bound up with that officer's large collection of

sketches of Indian fish, in four folio volumes, which he bequeathed to the

British Museum. These volumes have been inspected by many English and

foreign ichthyologists, and, among others, by Miiller and Henle, who refer to

them in their excellent ' Plagiostomen.' Another copy, left by Mr. Reeves at

Macao with Mr. Beale, formed the groundwork of the enumeration of Chi-

nese fish in j3ridgtman's ' Chrestomathy,' in which, by the way, very nume-

Arous mistakes in the generic names occur.  third copy, which he liberally

lent to me, is the foundation of this report*. The Banksian library also

contains a work entitled ' Figurge Piscium Sinensium a Pictore Sinensi pictae,*

·which is referred to by M. Valenciennes in the sixteenth and seventeenth

volumes of the ' Histoire des Poissons,' treating of the Cyprinidce ; the same
library possesses a Japanese treatise on fishes, with their Chinese names ap-

pended, and with coloured plates ; and a manuscript work entitled, " Descrip-
tions of Animals," being an account, in the Linnsean method, of the various

species, both terrestrial and marine, observed in a voyage to India and China,

with pen and ink figures of small size, but well-executed. The author is un-

known. There are also several Chinese works in the library of the British

Museum containing figures of fishes, but they are far inferior to the others

we have mentioned, and look more like fanciful designs than natural history

   * General Hardwicke began his collections of illustrations of Asiatic zoology in the last
century, and continued them till his final return to this country in 1818. He lost many
specimens and the fruit of much labour by three several shipwreclis ; but this, instead of
damping his ardour, roused him to fresh exertions, and he was busy up to the time of his
death in preparing his collections for pubUcation, the scientific part having been undertaken

by Mr. Gray. Among the drawings of fish whicli he procured, there are some by Major
Neeld. others by Major Farquhar, and a considerable number copied from the drawings of
Buchanan Hamilton, by that gentleman's consent, and by the same artists which he em-
ployed. This is mentioned because a charge of piracy has been made in the Calcutta Journal
against General Hardwicke, who was however too high-minded to appropriate to himself
the labours of others without due acknowledgement ; and the careful references in his own
writing on the drawings of Buchanan Hamilton, show that he had no intention of claiming
anything that belonged to that distinguished naturalist. The General bequeathed his speci-
mens and the whole of his collections of drawings, amounting to twenty folio volumes, to the
British Museum, and also set apart a sum of money to defray the expense of publishing the

scientific description of them. His collections have been deposited, as he wished, in the
national institution, but his intentions respecting the pubhcation have beeu entirely frustrated

by a chancery suit, which was instituted soon after his death.

illustrations. Mr. Reeves deposited in the British Museum specimens of

Chinese fish, both dried and preserved in spirits, part of them the very ex-
amples which are figured in his drawings. His son, J. R. Reeves, Esq., has

likewise presented various fish procured at Macao to the British Museum
among which are several species not figured in his father's drawings. The
Rev. George Vachell, who was Chaplain to the India Company at Macao

fifteen years ago, collected about 100 species of fish there, and presented

them to the Philosophical Institution at Cambridge, in whose museum they
are preserved in spirits, and mostly in good condition. One or two small
collections made at Chusan have reached the India House from officers

serving there during the late war, and several have been sent to Haslar
Hospital by the naval officers employed on various parts of the coast, more
especially by R. A. Baiikier, Esq., surgeon in the Royal Navy, and Captain
Sir Edward Belcher, whose specimens are figured in the ' Ichthyology of
the Voyage of the Sulphur,' recently published by aid from the Treasury
under the auspices of the Government. The College of Surgeons of Lon-
don also possesses a small number of Chinese fish, procured by Sir Everard

Home in the estuary of the Yang tsze keang, the great river which falls
into the entrance of the Yellow sea. An assemblage of Chinese fish, ex-

ceeding all these in number, exists in the Chinese collection, made by Mr.
Dunn, and now exhibiting at Hyde Park. The proprietor most liberally
permitted me to examine this important collection ; but owing to my re-
sidence at a distance from London, and the way in which the bottles hold-
ing the fish are secured in screwed-up cases, I have not been able to avail

myself of this permission to the necessary extent for the identification

of known species or the description of new ones. In the same collection
there are also many coloured drawings of fish. The following list is drawn
up from these various sources. Looking to the number of species which it

includes, I cannot but consider it as a pretty full enumeration of the fresh-
water and marine fish of the eastern coasts of the Chinese empire, and it will
furnish the inquirer into the geographical distribution of forms with several

important facts. The ichthyology of China forms a material link in the
evidence by which we are enabled to trace the variations in the numbers and
grouping of species from the seas of Ochotsk, Kamtschatka and Behring's
Strait southwards, by the Philippines, Malay archipelago, Javan sea and
Torres Straits to the coasts of Australia. The ' Ichthyology of the Voyage
of the Erebus and Terror,' under the command of Sir James Clark Ross,
another work which owes its existence to the support of Government, will
contain a much fuller account of the fish of the higher southern latitudes
than any previous ichthyological jjublication, together with figures of at least
100 new species, some of them taken beyond the Ylst parallel. In fact, the
gradual disappearance of the arctic forms in the seas of Japan and the north
of China, their replacement by other assemblages in the warmer latitudes,
and their re-appearance on the coasts of Van Diemen's Land, the southern
islands of New Zealand, the Aucklands and other antarctic lands, may be
followed with equal, if not more accuracy than similar gradations can be

traced through the Atlantic ocean.
    General ichthyology has not made sufficient progress to enable us to de-

duce the laws by which the geographical distribution of species is regulated.
The only modern work which professes to describe all the species is yet in
progress, and judging from the numerous additions of new species made by
every scientific expedition that has left Great Britain or France since the pub-
lication of the first ten or twelve volumes of the ' Histoire des Poissons,' we
are assured that very many fish remain to be incorporated in it when it sees

a new edirion, or in any other work that embraces tlie same objects : and in

regard to the extent of range of the described species, the alterations will be

no less important. I sliall not therefore attempt more in this paper in refer-

ence to the geographical distribution of fish than merely to mention one or

two facts that have some bearing on opinions at present entertained by geo-

logists. Much stress has been laid upon the existence of tropical forms of

fish in the ancient deposits of northern latitudes as a proof of the high tem-

perature of the earth in former ages; but I believe that the range of inter-

tropical species is less restricted than it has been supposed to be. Among

the Bermudas, on the 32nd parallel, the ChcctodontidcE are so abundant that

they are preserved in basins inclosed from the sea as an important article of

food for the garrison and inhabitants ; and a considerable number of fish

range northwards from the Brazils to the coasts of the United States, some

of them even to tlie banks of Newfoundland. It is probable that the gulf-

stream has something to do with this, as fewer tropical forms seem to reach

the same parallels on the coasts of Europe. If so, there is probably a cur-

rent of a similar kind setting to the northward on the coasts of China, for

many species which abound in the Indian ocean range as far north as Japan.

M. Agassiz says, " Les Xiphio'ides de Sheppy ont tous le bee arrondi comme

le Tetrapture et les Histiophores ; or ces derniers ne quittent jamais les mers

du Sud." (Rep. Br. Ass. for 1844', p. 305.) Yet M. Biirger has discovered

a Histiophorus on the south-west coasts of the Japanese isles, and the same

or another species exists in the seas of New Zealand.

Several remarkable generic forms described in the ' Fauna Japonica,* such

as Hoplegnathus or Scarodon, Histiopferns, Melcmichthys or Crenidens and

others, have been detected also in the Australian seas. In short, from the

4.2nd degree of south latitude to the same parallel north of the equator, be-

tween the meridians which include Australia, New Zealand, the Malay ar-

chipelago, China and Japan, there is but one ichthyological province, though

towards tlie respective extremes there is a mingling of antarctic and arctic

forms with a corresponding diminution in the numbers of the intertropical

ones. But in the middle portion of this province its dimensions in longitude

are vastly extended. Very many species of the Red sea, the eastern coast

of Africa, Madagascar and the Mauritius, range to the Indian ocean, the

--southern seas of China, the Malay archipelago, the northern coasts of Au-

stralia, and the whole of Polynesia, the almost continuous ranges of islands

Aapparently favouring their distribution.  comijaratively small number of

these species enter the Atlantic, and such as do are mostly Scomberoids,

Scopelines, Lophobranchs, Plectognathes or Sharks. It is repeatedly re-

marked in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' that few species of fish cross the

Atlantic. From this observation, the Scomberoids which skim the surface

of the high seas ought perhaps to be excluded ; and some allowance must

also be made for South American species discovered on the African coasts

and islands since the time that the passages in the ' Histoire dcs Poissons,' to

which I allude, were written. But with these qualifications, the remark ap-

pears to bo well-founded, and the great bulk of species on different sides of

the Atlantic are different. When we seek for some cause which may explain
this difference in the distribution of the fish of the two oceans, we observe

that the bounding shores of the Atlantic run north and south, with a deep

sea between them, and no transverse chains of islands. On the other hand,

we have from Africa eastward, within the warmer districts of the ocean, a

continuous range through the Indian ocean and archipelago, the Malay ar-

chipelago and Polynesia, which embraces three-fourths of the circumference

of the globe; there being no points of continent which cut through that

great zone and project into the colder regions to the southward*. Could

we suppose so extensive a belt, having a breadth of sixty degrees of latitude,

--to be suddenly elevated, we should find the remains of fish scattered over it

to be everywhere nearly alike; the species having a local distribution being

comparatively few and unimportant. These spoils of fish Avould of course,

if the opinions of Professor E. Forbes be well-founded, be associated with as-

semblages of moUusks and other marine animals, varying according to the

depth at which the deposit took place. When we advance northwards in
the Atlantic, beyond the 44th parallel, the number of species common to

both shores increases. The salmon of America is identical with that which

frequents the British Isles and the coasts of Norway and Sweden, and the

same is the case with the codfish and several other members of the Gadoid
family, and also with some Cottoids. The Cottoids increase in number and

variety as we approach the Arctic circle, and this is the case also in the

northern arm of the Pacific, though the generic forms differ from those of
the Atlantic. From the near approach probably of the Asiatic and Ame-
rican coasts at Behring Straits, the fish on both sides are nearly alike, down

to the sea of Ochotsk on the one side, and Admiralty inlet on the other. In

the sea of Japan, and the neighbouring coasts of China, we find northern

forms associated with many common to the temperate and warmer parts of

the ocean. In the colder regions of the southern hemisphere there is again

a predominance of the Cottoid and Gobioid families, but with a dissimilarity

in some of the generic forms, though there are also many genera identical

Wewith those of the northern ones.  again find in the southern seas codfish

much like those of the north, and Notacanthus and Macrourus, two very re-

markable Greenland genera, Avhich inhabit deep water, and are seldom pro-

cured except when thrown up by storms, have recently been discovered

on the coasts of New Zealand and South Australia. Several genera are

peculiar to the southern hemisphere, such as Notothenia, JBovichthys and

Harpagifer; and of these we find the same species at the Falklands, Cape

Horn, Auckland Islands and Kerguelen's Land ; in fact, in the whole circle

Newof the high latitudes. The fish of the  Zealand seas differ little from

those of- Van Diemen's Land and South Australia.

From what has been stated, it appears that the ichthyology of the Austra-

lian seas has an Asiatic character f as opposed to the Atlantic or South
American assemblages of species. The fish of the Pacific coasts of America

   * Neither the objects nor the limits of this report admit of a full consideration of the

manner in whicli an archipelago extending in longitude favours the diffusion of many spe-

cies of fish ; but I may remark cursorily, that the multiplication of places of deposit for
spawn on the shores of the islands and intervening coral banks, and tlie appropriate food
that many fish find in such places, may have much influence. The Chmtodonlhltv, Lahridm,
Balisfidte and other groups of littoral fish, are among the most remarkable for tlie extensive
range of species. Some oi theXophobranchi who inhabit floating beds of sea-weed, to which
they adhere by their prehensile tails, have also an extensive range; the moveable and e.\.ten-
sive beds of Sagasso being, in fact, as far as they are concerned, so many islands.

    t Mr. Gray informs us, that setting aside the Marsupials of Australia, which are of a dif-
ferent group from the South American ones, the ordinary quadrupeds, of which many species
are now known, have an Asiatic character; and that all the Australian reptiles are like those
of the Old World, wliile those which inhabit the Galapagos belong to American groups. The

genera, he goes on to remark, of the Australian reptiles are mostly pccuhar, but belong to
Asiatic, or at least to Old World families. One species, named Gecko veriis, is common to
Austraha and to India and its islands, and the P/estiodon b-lhieatum, which is very common
in Nortli America, exists also in Australia and Japan, and may perhaps have been introduced.

 The genus, which is a very natural one, and well-characterized, consists of five sjjecies, viz.
 the cosmopoUte one that we have mentioned, a second one inhabiting America, a third one
 belonging to North Africa, and two to China. Specimens fi'om different localities have been
 carefully examined by Mr. Gray, who considers the diffusion of the species of this geuus

 as an anomaly in the geograplucal dietributiou of reptiles.
192 REPORT--1845.

are too imperfectly known to enable us to ascertain how many of them range

to tiie other side of the great ocean. Is there a marked change either in

generic forms or species between the eastern limits of Polynesia and the

American coasts ?

The desultory observations 1 have thrown out respecting the distribution

of fish apply more particularly to the marine osseous fish, but those which

compose the sub-class of Cartilaginei have even a more extensive range. The

sharks of the China seas and of Australia are for the most part identical.

One of them, the Cestracion, has attracted the attention of geologists on ac-

count of the teeth of an ancient species having been found in European de-

posits, associated with fossil palms and other plants of the warmer regions.

But whatever inference may be drawn from the character of the plants, no

great reliance ought to be placed on the teeth of the Cestracion as an indi-

cation of the temperature when the deposit was made. The Australian

species, or one differing from it chiefly in colour and little in form, inhabits

likewise the seas of China and Japan ; and when deposits now forming are

revealed to the eyes of future geologists, its spoils will be found associated

with the Huon pines of Van Diemen's Land, the Eucalypti of New Holland,

the fern trees of New Zealand, or with the vegetation of the temperate parts

of Asia, according to the locality that is explored.

With regard to freshwaterJish, China agrees closely with the peninsula of

India in the generic forms, but not in species. It abounds with Cyprinidce,

Ophicephali and Siluridce. As in the distribution of marine fish the inter-

position of a continent stretching from the tropics far into the temperate or

colder parts of the ocean separates different ichthyological groups ; so with

respect to the freshwater species, the intrusion of arms of the sea running

far to the northwards, or the interposition of a lofty mountain chain, effects the

same thing. The freshwater fish of the Cape of Good Hope, and the South

American ones are different from those of India and China. The remarkable

mailed Siluroids of intertropical America are unlike any freshwater fish of

Africa or Asia, while the OphicepJiali are almost exclusively Asiatic ; a genus

of the same family being found at the Cape of Good Hope but none in Ame-

rica. The Cyprinidce have been said to be wanting in Polynesia and Au-

stralia. In the coral islands of Polynesia their absence is clearly owing to

the want of lakes or rivers, and of Australia it may be said that the rivers

have not been sufficiently explored. They exist in the larger islands of the

Javan ciiain, and it is likely that the same species will hereafter be detected

in the northern parts of Australia. And the Cyprinoid family is not alto-

Agether unknown in Australia.  curious marine Cyprinoid, the RhyncJiana

greyi (Ichth. of Voy. of Erebus and Terror), is not rare in the seas of New

Zealand and South Australia. It has been a prevalent opinion that the Cy-

prinidcB are exclusively freshwater fish, but the Catastomi of North America

frequent the estuaries of the rivers which fall into the Arctic sea, living indif-

ferently in the salt and fresh water, and thriving wherever they find proper

food. The anadromous Percoids differ very slightly in form from others that

are purely inhabitants of fresh waters ; and many examples of the same kind
might be adduced from among the marine fish *. The common anadromous

salmon (^Salmo salar) does not descend beyond the 41st degree of latitude on

the eastern coast of America, and it is probably restrained within similar bounds

on the eastern coast of Asia, for we find no representations of it among the

   * In the genera Amhassis and Apogon, there arc species truly marine, with others closely
resembling them, that inhabit fresh waters and even thermal springs of high temperature.
Most of the Corcfjoni pass their whole lives in inland waters, but many individuals, carried
down to the sea by river floods, live and thrive in the brackish or salt waters of the estuaries :
and the brackish lagoons of Port Essington on the north coast of Australia furnish full-grown
examples of Carangi, Mesopriones, and other fish considered to be purely marine.

Chinese drawings. It is said by ichthyological writers to be an inhabitant

of all the northern part of the Old World, from the entrance of the Bay of

Biscay northwards, by the North Cape, along the Arctic shores of Asia and

down the coasts of Kamtschatka to the sea of Ochotsk, including the Baltic,

White sea, Gulf of Kara and other inlets *. Other kinds of salmon abound

in the estuaries of Kamtschatka, and on the opposite coast of America down

to the Oregon, but none appear to descend to China.

In the following list Mr. Reeves's drawings are quoted by their original

numbers in his portfolio, and also as they are now placed in the volumes

bequeathed by General Hardwicke to the nation. A few of Mr. Reeves's

drawings, which are not in General Hardwicke's collection, are also quoted.

When 1 have seen Chinese examples of any of the species enumerated in the

list, I have seldom omitted to mention the museum in which they are de-

posited                                  and when nothing is said  of  specimens, it  is to be understood that
                                      ;

the species is named from the inspection of Mr. Reeves's draM'ings, or when

there is no figure on the authority of the authors quoted. The Chinese

names are in some cases written from sound and not from sense f. The sounds

in English characters and the translations were furnished to me by Mr. Reeves

and Mr. Birch, of the British Museum.

Mr. Reeves informs me that few of the fishes represented in the drawings

are brought to the tables of foreigners. Soles are almost constantly presented

at breakfast, and the Scicena lucida generally forms a part of that meal.
The Leucosoma, or White Bait of the residents, and a Serranus, are regular

dinner dishes ; and the Polynemus called Salmon-fish and the Stromateus or

Pomfret, when in season. Sturgeon is occasionally seen. The Chinese eat

all kinds, from a shrimp to a shark ; but Carp, Bream, Siluri, Ophicephali
and Gobies, are the principal fish seen in the markets of Canton.

In drawing up the list 1 have received much aid from John Edward Gray,

Esq., Keeper of the Zoological Department of the British Museum, who

had commenced a work on the subject ; and great facility in consulting the

books and specimens of that institution. With the same want of reserve the
Museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Institution was opened to me ; and
I have already mentioned the liberality of the late proprietor of the Chinese
collection at Hyde Park.

   * Professor Nilsson mentions that salmon inhabit the freshwater lakes of Sweden named

Wenem and Siljan during the winter and spring, and then ascend the rivers to spawn, re-

turning to the lakes again to recruit, as salmon of other rivers do to the sea. The same

habit has been ascribed to the salmon of Lake Ontario.

point at the central bridle, and the dental plates turn out over the upper and under jaw. In
the outline of the disc it resembles the Nalla temere of Russell (pi. 2), but in this fish the
ground colour is white and the spots more round and regular.

    The width of the disc is to its length as six to seven, and as it is widest posterior to its
middle, it has a very broadly ovate form, without any angles, the snout being rounded. The
breadth of the disc is equal to the length of the tail from the anus to the tip of the caudal fin.
The ventrals have a slightly convex edge with the fore and hinder corners only moderately
rounded. The claspers project beyond its edge. First dorsal rather larger than the second.
The distance between the eyes and edge of the snout is equal to a fourth of the width of the
disc, and the spout-holes, which are larger than the orbits and have smooth edges, are con-
tiguous to them. Colour of the upper surface reddish-brown, with larger and smaller dark
liver-brown spots, the largest being placed on the middle line of the back and tail. Some of
 the spots which lie round the electrical apparatus run into curved bars, and there are two lon-
gitudinal dark bars on the ventrals. The under surface is white, with reddish and purple tints
round the edges of the various parts. Length of the figure 13 inches. Breadth of the disc

 5'2 inches.

    This ficure has the same Chinese name with the preceding one, and much the same colours
 and spotst but it presents such difference in form, that, looking to the general accuracy of Mr.
 Reeves's admirable collection of drawings, prevents me from considering it as a representation
 of the same fish ; yet the discrepancies are not sufficient in the absence of specimens to induce
 me to name it as specifically distinct. The general proportions of length and breadth do not
 differ greatly from those of lingula, but the disc is more widely rounded anteriorly, and more
 gibbous just behind the eyes, making an approach, though a slight one, to the sub-rhomboidal
 form of A^. indica. The posterior corners of the disc overlap the ventrals rather more, and
 the latter are considerably larger with a more rounded outline. They extend backwards to
 the middle of the first dorsal. The second dorsal is drawn a trifle larger than the first. The
  eyes also are proportionally nearer to each other and to the fore-edge of the disc than in lin-
 gula. There are some slight differences in the spots, but scarcely so much as to require de-
  scription. The posterior lobes of the disc are deeply tinged with arterial blood-red, but the
  colours in other respects are the same. The fish represented was a female, as no claspers are

  shown. Length of the figure 16 inches, width S-3 inches.

   Mijller and Henle describe the colours of the dried fish as uniform. In Mr. Reeves's draw-
ing the ground colour is clove-brown, shaded obscurely with liver-brown, and with a reddish-
brown tint before the eye. There are also many paler v.'ood-brown spots, which are sprinkled
with dark dots. Exterior to the eyes on each side, six of the smaller pale spots are arranged
so as to form a ring round a central one : similarly arranged spots occur near the margin of the
widest part of the disc on each side, and also more posteriorly, while nearer the mesial line on
each side there is an uninterrupted pale ring with a central spot, and a like ring exists on the
posterior lobe of the disc. The edges of the under surface, which are partially shown in the
drawing, are purplish-red. The spines correspond better with the letter-press description than
with the figure given in the 'Plagiostomen' of MUlIer and Henle. Length of figure 14 inches,

    This ray has much resemblance in form to the Tr. walga, as figured by Miiller and Henle,
 and still more to the Tenlcee shindraki of Russell (pi. 5), or to Tr, bennetiii, M. und H. ; but it
 has a considerably longer tail than either, and slight indications of both an upper and an under
 short hem- like seam on the tail. The form of the disc is obovate, with a sharp point to the snout,
 but no incurvature of the fore-edge, nor any decided convexity. Its breadth at the hinder
 edge of the spout-holes is equal to its length, excluding the ventrals, and the tail measures
 fully twice as much. The eyes are distant from the point of the snout one-quarter of the
 length of the disc, and less than that from each other. Two small spines (or perhaps pores)
 are situated side by side between the posterior edges of the spout-holes on the middle line.

 Colour, pale flesh-red, almost white in parts ; the tail darker towards the point. It is pos-
 sible that this inay be merely a variety of Tr. bennettii. Mr. Reeves thinks that it is the
 voung of some species. Length or bi'eadth of disc, 2^ inches.

    In this drawing the disc of the fish is thickly covered with eyed spots, which are inclosed
in hlackish-green reticulations. Each spot has a pale silvery central disc, surrounded by a
blackish ring, which is shaded off, and is itself enchased in a broader pale wood-brown border.
The disc is rounded on each side in front, and falcate behind, witVi a small acute point form-
ing its interior tip. The figure is about 22 inches long, of which Hi inches is tail. The width
of the disc from tip to tip is 8f inches. 1 have met with no specimen of this fish.

    It is possible that several species may be confounded under the appellation of "oblong sun-
 fish," a point which must be determined by a comparison of specimens from various quarters
 of the ocean. Mr. Yarrell's figure is not so high as Bloch's, which, according to Cuvier, was
 drawn from a fiih taken at the Cape of Good Hope. Lacepede's figure corresponds with this
 in form, but it is variously striped, and is made a distinct species in the ' Regne Animal * under
  the name of O. varius. Mr. Yarrell however observes, that tlie British examples acquired
 beautiful waved stripes after death. The Japanese figure has the form of Bloch's.

  A specimen of this fish was sent from Hong Kong to Haslar Museum by Surgeon R. A.

Bankier, of the Royal Navy. It has lost the dorsal fin by friction, but is otherwise in good
condition. Its height at the tip of the pelvic spine is equal to half its total length, and its
greatest thickness is rather less than one-tliird of the height. The profile is an irregular
oval, beyond which the short trunk of the tail projects not more than a tenth of the whole
length. The face ascends in a straight line to the dorsal spine, whose height is equal to one
quarter of the height of the body. The space between this spine and the second dorsal, cor-
responding in length to the spine, is horizontal and somewhat depressed. The pelvic bone is
not capable of being stretched much out of the oval, and the membrane behind it is thin, not
capable of lateral distension, and without rays, but having the small scales narrower and far-
ther apart than on the body, and thus admitting of a slight folding-up. The edge of the
202 REPORT-- 1845.

 membrane is convexly curved. The skin is covered with small scales which are each com-
 posed of a dozen or more minute spines that appear to stand out on every side, but the
 skin feels rough only when the finger is drawn towards the head. These scales do not appear
 to differ in size on any part of the head or body when viewed by the naked eye, but on the
 laterafparts of the tail the numerous spines of each scale are seen through a lens to be replaced
 by one, two, or three fine recurved bristles. All the fin-rays are rough, with minute points,
 and the dorsal is armed on each side by a row of pretty strong recurved spinous teeth, its front
 being rough like the other rays. Tlie small trigger-ray in its axilla can be detected only by
 dissection. The point of the pelvic bone is a knob set with spines somewhat coarser than
those of the scales. The pectoral fin is small and the gill-opening does not descend below
 the base of its first ray. There is no peculiarity in the scales which border this opening. The
 colour, after maceration in spirits, is purplish-gray, with about twelve interrupted horizontal
dark lines on the body, running from the head to the caudal fin. There are also some spots
on the face. No lateral line can be detected. There are two dark vertical bands on the
caudal. This species is readily distinguished from M. bifilamentosus and clujiensis by the
want of the strong curved caudal spines, and from M.japonicus by the profile, the form of the
scales and dewlap, and by the horizontal dark streaks. It differs from the monoceros of Os-

Pegasus latirostris, Richardson.

    Specimens exist in the British Museum, and are occasionally to be met with in the Chinese
 insect-boxes. They have the general form of P. draco, but the beak is nearly as broad as it
 is long. As in the others, the beak is grooved in the centre above and below, and the edges
 of the upper groove are elevated so as to form a furrowed crest with an irregular outline. The
 flat lateral plates of the snout are transversely ridged, and toothed on the edges by the points
 of the ridges. In laternarius the edges of the inferior groove of the beak are elevated, and
 the mesial line above is partially so, making seven ridges. The whole is shorter and much
 narrower than that either of draco or latirostris, yet specimens of the latter with the lateral
edges of the beak mutilated may be mistaken for it.

    Small specimens of this fish, pinned down and dried, abound in the boxes of insects sold
at the Chinese ports to foreigners. The museum at Haslar contains several of a larger size,
taken in the China seas by Sir Edward Belcher, but they have been unfortunately consider-
ably injured by friction during their voyage to England. Mr. Reeves's drawing of the
recent fish leaves however little to be desired. In form it agrees with Bloch's figure, but
the latter exaggerates the spines of the head. The humeral or coracoid spine is alike in both
representations. The general colour is hair-brown, finely marbled by a lighter tint on the

upper surface of the body and pectoral fins. A blackish mark speckled with white occupies

the pectoral axilla. The caudal is less sharply banded than in Bloch's figure ; a pinkish hue
spreads over the anal, which, like the dorsal, is unspotted.

seum which was captured at Tenasserim. Dr. Riippell observes, that the many individuals

which he had an opportunity of observing in the Red sea presented constant differences in the

numbers of the fin-rays and in colour from the Atlantic fish. In regard to the latter, I have
stated above the variations of the rays tliat exist in the few specimens furnished by the museum
at Haslar ; and in respect to colour, I may add that the patterns they present appear to be
infinite. I have seen on the western coast of Africa some hundreds attached to the bottom of

a ship, and darting off in a dense body to partake of the washings of the cook's coppers or any

other greasy matter that was thrown overboard. All had, it is true, a very disagreeable-
looking livid ground colour and a dark band on the cheek more or less extensively prolonged

on the flanks, but the rest of the dark marks seemed to be alike in no two individuals. Spe-
cimens 6 or 8 inches long have a trapezoidal caudal fin, but when they attain 18 inches or

more the end of the fin is lunate, and the curve seemingly increases in older individuals, as it

is pretty considerable in a specimen 2^ feet long.

Cambridge Philosophical Institution, having been brought from China by the Rev. George
Vachell. It belongs to the group of kokius, but I have not been able to identify it with any
of those described in the ' Histoire des Poissons.' It has a depressed head with the eyes almost
touching, an advancing lower jaw and a rounded caudal. Teeth setaceous, not crowded,
and disposed much like those of a Serranus. The outer row on the lower jaw is composed of
somewhat taller recurved ones. Four of the very short upper and under caudal rays appear

lower jaw spotted with liver-brown and white. Dorsal mottled by rows of black specks on
the rays. Mr. Reeves's drawing shows irregular blackish-green specks thickly spread over
the olive-green ground colour of body and head, with an admixture of reddish-orange on the
lower part of the sides and belly, the whole having a dark hue. Vertical fins olive-green and

This species is of the group headed in the ' Histoire des Poissons ' (xii.p.85)byG. venenatus.

The height of the head is equal to half its length, which is contained four times and a quarter

in the whole length of the fish, or thrice and a half when the caudal is excluded. Belly pro-
minent behind the ventrals, and the height there equals the length of the head. Lower jaw

rather longest. Small eyes more than a diameter apart. Teeth in broad villiform plates, with

those in the outer row a little taller, especially on the sides of the upper jaw and front of the

Alower one.  small canine on the middle of each limb of the lower jaw. Scales ciliated, with

strong streaks diverging from the free apex of their exposed rhomboidal discs. Head scaly,

middle of the cheek, and another on the upper edg« of the interoperculuni. First dorsal

about twice as high as the second one. Caudal fenestrated by clear points, but its colours

have perished. Six rows of roundish or arrow-headed clear specks correspond with the rows

of scales on the sides, and there is a series of pale curved muscular marks along the lateral

line. The Rev. G. Vachell's specimen, deposited in the museum of the Cambridge Philoso-

Another species of the same group, deposited in the same institution by the Rev. G. Vachell,

is distinguished by a series of silvery specks running down the middle of the tail. These
specks, six in number, are irregular in form, and the first is placed over the vent, a narrow

silvery stripe coincident with the spinal column preceding it. There are also a few silvery

specks on the nape, one on the temples, another on the gill-cover, and two lines of pores on the

cheek. The scales are pretty large, ciliated and faintly streaked. The body has a linear

form, its height being about the eighth of the whole length of the fish. Head bluntly rounded

  --In the paper above quoted, which is entitled " Chinensia Lngerstroemiana," Linnaeus cha-

racterises a Goby in the following terms : " Lingun lavis. Denies parvi acuminati. Oculi

    Osbeck, in the account of his voyage to Cliina, performed in 1751, but not published till
1757, and after his specimens had been examined by Linnaeus, mentions a Goby, which is
called Tannoao by the Chinese, and which he considers to be the same with the G. niger of
Linnjeus. This mistake is pointed out in the ' Histoire des Poissons ' by M. Valenciennes (xiv.
p. 16), but in ([uoting the rays of the first dorsal from Osbeck, there is a misprint of 1| for 1 \\.
At page 188 of the volume of the work just quoted, this fish is suspected to be a variety of

the Periophlhabnus kcelreuteri ; and it is possible that both this and the preceding species may
actually belong to that genus. In the German translation of Osbeck's ' Voyage,' this species
appears to have been named Jpocryptes cantonensis (C. et V. /. c).

   The figure here quoted has a general resemblance to Gobioides broussonneti of Lacepdde
(C. et V. pi. 348), but the single dorsal and the anal occupy less space. The name of Gobius
melanurus was written by Broussonnet himself over the figure, and he mentions the species by
the same appellation in his first decade. The pectorals appear to be funnel-shaped, but their
rays have most probably been incorrectly counted. The unknown author of the work gives

--us merely the following notice of the characters in addition to the numbers of the rays quoted

above : " Nearly cylindrical. Head roundish. One dorsal. Tail pointed with a black spot
on the base of the fin" above the middle. " Eight inches long."

   This fish is very commonly carried about the streets for sale. Two specimens, now in the
museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Institution, were brought from China by the Rev.
George Vachell. They have less resemblance to Osbeck's figure o{ Apocryptes pectinirostris
than what is shown by a Boleophthalmus, obtained in the same seas by Mr. Vachell and

noticed below. A. serperaster has a long pointed caudal, and scales sufficiently visible to the

naked eye, but not ciliated, or only sparingly and deciduously so. A skinny preorbitar lip.

Three canines on each intermaxillary, and one interior one on each side of the symphysis
below. Twenty-one side teeth on each limb of the upper jaw, and sixteen horizontal ones

with incurved tips on each limb of the lower jaw. Five rays of first dorsal nearly of equal
length, the sixth very short, and omitted in Reeves's figure. The last ray of the second
dorsal and anal divided to the base. Colour dirty wood-brown with darker patches at intervals.
Paler and silvery on the sides and belly. The figure shows none of the spots or blue lines on
the dorssds which exist in Osbeck's pectinirostris. Length of the specimens 6 inches, of the

caudal nearly 1^ inch. Length from snout to anus 2-2 inches.

   Two Chinese species of this genus have been named by ichthyologists. One, the Ttenioide

hermannien of Lacepfide, was originally described from a Chinese painting, and is most pro-
bably the Shay king of Mr. Reeves's portfolio, but as the specific name has been appropriated
in the ' Histoire des Poissons ' to an Indian fish, which is certainly distinct if Hamilton Bu-
chanan's figure 9, pi. 5, be correct, confusion will be best avoided by giving it another name.
Three specimens, brought from Macao by the Rev. George Vachell, exist in the museum of the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, which are remarkable for the sharply-elevated, crenated,
cuticular ridges on the face and lower jaw. Four of these ridges radiate from the eye as a
centre, and five diverge from a spot on the cheek. These are connected by longitudinal ridges,
and there are several less prominent and more distinctly porous ones on the gill-pieces. The
lower jaw is crossed transversely by short ridges as prominent as those on the face. Neither
from the figures nor descriptions of other species do we learn that they have facial ridges ap-
proaching to these in distinctness. The upper jaw shows about fourteen more or less acute com-
pressed teeth in its circumference. The lower jaw is armed by about six teeth longer than the
upper ones, and in both jaws there are several rows of much smaller, crowded, acute teeth,
well-separated from the outer ones. The head is contained 7§ times in the total length, the
vent is rather behind the anterior third, and the caudal fin forms a ninth of the whole length.
The dorsal fin is somewhat highest about the middle of the tail, where it rather exceeds half
the height, and the anal, in which no spine could be detected, is half as high as the dorsal.
The fins are fleshy, so that the rays are not to be counted without difficulty. Mr. Vachell's
specimens and Mi'. Reeves's figure have a contraction at the junction of the vertical fins, as if fi
string had been tied tightly round them, and it is probable that they are so usually carried by
the fishermen. Ventrals spoon-shaped, with short stout spines. Scales'very minute, deeply
imbedded and distant from each other. Length, total 6'25 inches; of which the distance between
mouth and anus is 2'38 inches, and the length of caudal 0'72 inch. Another specimen mea-
sures 8J inches, and a third 3^ inches.

   Two specimens in the Cambridge Philosophical Society's museum, brought from Macao by

the Rev. George Vachell, agree tolerably with the short characters given by Linnaeus of his
anguillaris, received from the same quarter. As compared with other Amblyopi, indeed the
pectoral fins could not be said to be " valde pan'ce," but they may be so described in refer-
ence to the Gobies, with which Linnaeus grouped this fish. The difFerf nee in the enumeration
of the rays of the dorsal and anal will be lessened, if instead of twelve rays gi^en to the caudal in
the 'Systema Naturae,' we reckon seventeen. This specie? is whitish or colourless in spirits, with

translucent integuments, permiiting the contents ofthe belly to shine through, and the fine mem-
branes are more delicate, so that the rays can be more readily seen. The minute black eyes
are easily seen on the white head. The caudal is larger and m.ore lanceolate than in rugosus,
and the pectorals longer and more acute. The porous lines on the face are scarcely elevated,

   * There are either several species of Amblyopu» in the Chinese waters, or the numbers of the
rays differ in the same species. In the ' Descriptions of Animals,' which we already quoted,
f. 15 represents an Amblyopus, which Broussonnet has considered as the anguillaris of
Linnaeus. The author enumerates the rays as D. 47 ; A. 42 ; P. 8 ; V. 6 ; and says that the
fish dwells in the muddy banks of the river at Canton, and is eaten by the natives.

and the dentition differs from that o( rugosus. There are four, five, or six slender cylindrical
teeth on each limb of eacli jaw, rather acute, with brown tips, and not all of one length. The
interior ones are in a single row, small and pearly, a few near the angle of the upper jaw
being sligbtly larger. Length 4-SO inches, of which the caudal is 1-12 inch, the head 0-60 inch,
and tlie length from mouth to vent 1'48 inch.

A specimen brought from Canton by the Rev. G. Vachell and deposited in the Cambridge

Philosophical Institution, corresponds with the few particulars mentioned in the passages

regarding this species quoted above, except that the colours have suffered from long mace-

ration in spirits, and can no longer be well made out. As the pectorals are mounted on an

arm-like basis, though it is short and not bent, I have referred this fish rather to Boleo-

phthalmu.i than to Apocryptes. The dentition does not seem to distinguish the two genera as

established in the 'Histoire des Poissons,' at least I can perceive no essential distinction between

the teeth oiAp. dentatus (C. V. xiv. p. 148) and of a Boleophthalmus. The rays of the first

dorsal of pectinirostris are all filamentous, the central one being tallest and the others gra-

duated. The membrane dark purple. Pectorals lanceolate. Ventrals small, infundibuliform.

Fins generally tipped with wood-brown, and a diffused brownish spot on the second dorsal.

Body brownish-gray, spotting effaced. Belly white. Scales very minute, the integument

swelling over them like papilla;. Three canine teeth on each side of the symphysis of the

upper jaw aie followed by eighteen very minute lateral ones. Twenty-seven horizontal teeth

with brownish truncated tips, which are not incurved, arm each limb of the lower jaw, and there

Ais a stronger interior tooth on each side of the symphysis.  small obtuse lobe projects from

the preorbitar lip behind the canines on each side. The eyes touch each other, and their

upper lids are granulated. Length, total 2'80 inches; length of head 0*62, length of caudal

0-50 inch.

   Examples of this species exist in the British Museum and in the collection of the Cambridfje
Philosophical Society, procured at Macao by John Reeves, Esq. and the Rev. George Vachell.
The College of Surgeons also possesses specimens obtained at Woosung in the estuary of
Yang tse kiang by Sir Everard Home. The species has much resemblance to the Gobius viridis
of Buchanan Hamilton, pi. 32. f. 12 {Boleophthalmus viridis of the ' Histoire des Poissons,'
xii. p. 213), in form and also in the spotting, but the colours differ, and the Indian fish has a

higher profile. It is probably the species noticed from a Chinese painting in the ' Histoire
des Poissons' (xii. p. 215) as bearing a resemblance to B. histiophorus.

Of this fish we have seen no specimen, and it may eventually prove to be one of the pre-

ceding two species, but the colours and markings do not correspond with the little that is said

of them. It is a less slender fish than the B. aucupatorius, and has a comparatively low first

dorsal, with a shorter though acute caudal fin. It has a yellowish-brown colour above the

middle line, with crowded darker specks of the same and a flesh-red tint below, also mottled

on the flanks with darker purplish dots. The belly before the vent and the cheeks are un-

spotted. The base of the pectoral is dark, the ventrals and anal are ochraceous, and the other

Afins are pale gray or dilute broccoli-brown.  single black spot tips the second' dorsal pos-

teriorly.

Aalong the upper quarter of the height to the caudal. The areas of the meshes are paler.

short blackish bar runs backwards from the lower part of the eye to the preoperculum, and
there are some crowded blackish-brown dots on the gill-plate. The dorsals, anals and ven-
trals have a pale neutral tint colour (bluish or pearl-gray). The first dorsal is crossed by
three branching and undulating lines, and the second dorsal by eight pairs of blue waving
lines. The anal and ventrals are marked along each ray by a crowded series of small blue
a\-row-heads or chevrons. The caudal is also marked with chevrons, but they are orange-
brown and umber, and the ground tint of the fin corresponds with that of the body. The
pectoral is wood-brown or buif, with blackish dots on the rays.

Since I described a male of this species in the work above quoted, I have examined two

examples brought from Macao by the Rev. George Vachell, which I consider to be females,

myand to justify  quotation of Mr. Reeves's fi^jure as appertaining to this species. The latter

drawing is a good representation of these specimens, except that it shows but a small portion

of the black mark between the third and fourth rays of the comparatively low first dorsal, the

fin-membrane of the individual placed before the Chinese artist having evidently been torn.

Neither of the specimerjs has an anal tubercle : both of them have three recurved teeth on the

upper side of thelongpreopercular spine, and one of them has moreover a strong basal tooth

beneath pointing forwards, while the other has merely a slight indication of an under-tooth

near the middle of the spine.

(Schn.) I strongly suspect that Houttuyn's fish is identical with that which I have considered
to be the female of C. reevesii, though the caudal fin is longer than in Mr. Vachell's specimens,
and shorter than that of the male figured in the ' Ichthyology of the Voyage of the Sulphur.'

spine, with three spreading upper spinous teeth turned forwards {en patte d'oie), this can
scarcely be reconciled with the description of the spine ofjaponicus. C. punctatus has asmall

    This species is distinguished from the preceding, which it closely resembles, by having a
tooth fewer on the under edge of the preoperculum and by other slight differences in form.
I have had an opportunity of comparing Sir Edward Belcher's Chinese specimen of scaber
above mentioned with one of Biirger's Japanese examples of asper belonging to the British
Museum. The text of the ' Fauna Japonica' quotes the rays of asper as D. 5|-11 ; A. 15, &c.
but a specimen in the museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, procured at Macao by the
Rev. George Vachell, and Burger's one authenticated by Schlegel, present the formula which

we have given above. The last two rays of the dorsal and anal are approximated and may
be reckoned as branches or separate rays, making the numbers 12 or 13 and 13 or 14, ac-
cording to the way in which they are viewed.

   A specimen collected by the Rev. George Vachell exists in the museum of the Cam-

bridge Philosophical Institution, which ought, I think, to be referred to this species, though
its fin-rays are as follows: Had. B. 6 ; D. 5|-20; A. 16; C. 13f, &c. The caudal fin has
the second long ray from the top lengthened as in pulchella; there are four rows of white
spots on the anal ; and the streaks on the head are nearly as exhibited in the ' Fauna Japonica,'
particularly a black crescentic mark behind each eye. The dots on the dorsal are mostly

effaced.

    I have some suspicion of the Japanese fish being merely a variety of the Percis nehulosa
(C. et V. iii. p. 2C0), and that the Dentex fasciatus (Solauder, Pisces Australise), or Percis
emeryana (Richardson, Icones Piscium, t. 1. f. 1), is another variety; in which case the fish
inhabits the ocean from Japan down to Australia.

   It appears to me that the peculiar forms of the rays of the anal, as well as of some of the
other fins, and many other particulars of structure, ally this group more closely to the Tri-
gliclce than to the Percidee. The Trachinus vipera has the suborbitar united by a bony bridge
to the upper limb of the preoperculum, and other members of the group show more or less of

that projection of the suborbitar chain which characterizes the following family.

    The Cambridge Philosophical Institution possesses a specimen which was procured by the
Rev. George Vachell at Canton, and is correctly represented by Mr. Reeves's figure, ex-
cept in the dorsal fin. In this the first three dorsal spines are a little separated from the
Others, and the coarse membrane of the rest of the fin is notched to half the depth of each spine
and forms a thick lobulet to every tip. The soft dorsal is crossed obliquely by a dark brown
bar, and there are three approximating brown bars on its base, which also cross the posterior
spinous rays obliquely. The caudal has a brown membrane, and its rays are ringed by about
six white marks alternating with brown ones. The body is brown with whitish spots more
mottled than in the figure, and the intermediate spaces are paler. The form of the head is
well rendered, and fringed barbels depend from almost every salient point. Two small ones
hang from the chin, and a large one with a basal branchlet from the middle of each limb of

the lower jaw. A thin smooth transverse ridge unites the orbits behind; there is a com-

pressed knob behind each eye, and three knobs flank the nape on each side and include three
rays of the dorsal. The lateral preocular depressions are deep. A. short, stout, and not
very pungent preopercular spine can be felt through the skin.

    In the museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Institution there is a small Sebastes which

was brought from China by the Rev. George Vachell, that I have not been able to identify

with any described species, neither am I confident that Mr. Reeves's figure ought to be re-

ferred to it ; but it agrees better with it than with any other that I have seen.
    Eyes approximated with elevated orbital plates and a ridge dividing the furrow between

them. Three acute, falcate teeth on the edge of each orbit, three larger ones behind the
orbit, and a small one on the temples. Nasal spines small and acute. Under edge of the pre-

orbitar straight, ending in a spinous tooth pointing backwards. A thin unarmed ridge is con-

tinued from this tooth across the cheek to the root of the preopercular spine, where it is met
by another ridge coming from the under edge of the orbit. These converging lines or ridges
enclose a smooth disc, the rest of the cheek being scaly. Operculum armed by two small,
flat spinous points and three angular corners. Opercular spines flat, weak and small, with no
visible ridges extending from their roots. Gill-cover scaly. Maxillaries and jaws without
 scales. Angular ridges and points of the supra-scapulars and supra- axillary plate of the co-
 racoid bone neither strong nor conspicuous. Scales of the body small, oblique and ciliated.
 Colours of specimen faded. From the uncertainty of the drawing belonging to this species I
 do not describe its tints in connection with it.

   A tpecimen exists in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park. The colours are not described

--in the ' Fauna Japonica;' but the following are the leading tints exhibited in Mr. Reeves's

 figure: The body generally is brownish-red, paler and more lively on the under parts, and
 very dark towards the dorsal line. It is dotted throughout by darker points, apparently one
 to each scale, and there are several large, pale or bluish round spots on the sides. The head

 above and on the cheeks is like the body, and beneath it is unspotted. A crimson or reddish-

 orange is the general tint of the vertical fins, which, except the anal, have also two or three
 rows of dark round spots. The pectorals are orpiment and reddish-orange, with rows of
 black dots on the upper or branching rays. The ventials are reddish-orange without spots.

 Sebastes longiceps, Richardson. Rad. D. 13|)0; A. 2|6; P. 17; V. 1|5.

     In the boxes of insects which are brought from China I have found examples of two spe-
 cies of Sebastes which appear to be undescribed. One of them has some resemblance to S.
 pachycephalus, but dilFers from it, and the rest of its congeners, in the greater comparative
 length of its head, which is contained twice and a half in the total length of the fish, caudal
 included. The nasal spines are very small, and there are three small teeth on the slightly
 raised upper edge of the obit, four or five minute serratures in its middle part, and three larger
 jagged teeth at its posterior corner. The two low, rounded intra-orbital ridges arc separated
 from each other by a narrow mesial furrow, and the whole space betweei? the eyes does not

exceed two-thirds of the diameter of the orbit. The ridge which flanlis the top of the cranium
is a regular saw with five teeth ; but the temporal ridges, though equally prominent, are more
irregularly toothed. A low, thin, irregularly incised edge crests the infra-orbitar ridge, and
three minute teeth arm the posterior edge of the preorbitar. The preopercular spine is very-
short, and is not bigger than the compressed tooth which overlies it. Only two teeth or an-
gular corners exist on the edge of the bone below the spine. The operculum shows the usual
two low ribs ending in short spinous points, but there are no serratures on the suboperculum,
interoperculum or lower jaw. Small scales cover the top of the head to the nostrils, the cheek
and gill-covers ; but none can be detected on the maxillaries, which are most probably scaleless
in the recent fish. The scales are minutely toothed on the edge.

   'Shis Sehastes, also discovered in an insert-box, is not armed on the head by rows of spines

Alike others of the genus, but presents in place of them very low, thin and serrated crests.

low double crest skirts the upper edge of the orbit, and is followed on each side of the cranium

by a rather higher single one. Two ridges, nearly as high as the edges of the orbit, run for-

ward between the eyes to the nostrils, their tips being the only substitutes for the usual nasal
spines. The small preorbitar has an irregular but obscurely stellate cancellated disc, with two
small descending spinous teeth on its under edge. The second suborbitar, which crosses the
cheek, shows two thin, finely serrated crests that include a rugose disc. The edge of the pre-
operculum is serrated throughout, but it is only by aid of a lens that a minute spine can be de-
tected at its angle, and clusters of spinous points on the usual sites of the four angular corners.
The temples are roughly bony, and each limb of the lower jaw is traversed by three serrated

crests higher than the cranial ones. A triangular operculum ends in a minute spinous point*,
the suboperculum being prolonged beyond it to a fine tip. A few crenatures exist on the sub-

operculum where its edge meets the interoperculum.
   Top of the head nearly on a line with the back, the orbits being close to the profile, but not

elevated. The interorbitar space exceeds half the diameter of the orbit in breadth, and is
scaly between the ridges. Scales cover the whole side of the head except the ridges, and also
the disc of the maxillary, and like those which cover the body, they are coarsely ciliated.
Minute villiform teeth arm the jaws and the very small acute chevron of the vomer; but the
palate bones appear to be toothless. This points to a generic difference from Sebastes. Many
of the rays have been mutilated and the specimen is otherwise much injured, so that we can-
not complete the description. The dorsal spines are slender, moderately tall, and grooved oa
the sides. The first two are contiguous to each other, and the penultimate one is much shorter
than the last one. The pectorals reach to the beginning of the anal fin; and the third anal
spine is one-fourth longer than the second one. The head forms nearly a third of the entire
length, which in our specimen is 4 inches.

   To this species I am inclined to refer five or six small specimens which I picked out of the
China insect-boxes, chiefly because they have a black spot between the seventh and ninth dor-
sal rays. The spines, intra-orbitar ridges, &c., correspond with the descriptions and figure in
the ' Fauna Japonica ;' but the length of the lower preorbitar, which almost equals that of an
Apistcs, is not noticed in that work. The specimens are much damaged, though the barbel be-
tween the posterior superciliary spines is still visible. The cheek is not scaly, and in this
the species differs from the Scorpcena miUlaris (Ichth. Ereb. and Terr.) of Van Diemen's Land,
which in most other respects it closely resembles. Edge of the palate-bones and chevron of the

vomer set with teeth. Scales finely ciliated.

Awhich the rows of its strong spines are tiled upon each other.  pretty tall- feathered barbel

rises from the posterior third of the orbit, and there are many others on the lower jaw and

under corner of the maxillary and preoperculum, also numerous small ones on the flanks. The

ground tint of the sides, which is reddish- brown, is clouded by largish masses of dark umber,

the belly being paler and the summit of the back dark. The vertical fins are irregularly and

obliquely barred with umber, and the pectorals are marked also by three cross bars formed by

umbrine spots on the rays. Iris and tip of the caudal reddish. These particulars are noted

   It is very probably a fish of this genus, which was observed by Steller at Cape Cronok and

the mouth of the Itschia, and named by him Cottus villosus (Pall. Zoogr. Ross. p. 129). He

states that it has three barbels on the lower jaw, and compares it to a Platycephalus, which
Centridermichthys in fact considerably resembles. Tilesius, on the other hand, seems to have
mistaken for Cottus villosus the Aploactes aspera noticed above, which is by no means like a

Platycephalus.

   Several specimens oi Centridermichthys uncinatus, procured at Woosung in the estuary of the
Yang tsee kiang kew by Sir Everard Home, were presented by him to the College of Surgeons.

It differs in having a more prominent belly and a shorter anal fin, though with as numerous
rays as the anal of the preceding. It also wants the fine black lines which run through the
centres of each row of scales above the lateral line, which are represented in the preceding
figure. The four free pectoral rays have the same relative length.

This species is established in the ' Fauna Japonica ' solely from a drawing of M. Biirger's, no

specimen having reached the authors. Mr. Reeves's drawing is more elaborately coloured,

and differs from that in the ' Fauna Japonica,' more in minute details than in general effect.

The edges of the scales have an olive tint, and their discs are occupied by flexuose, red veins.

The end of the snout, a circle round the eye, and the upper edge of the preorbitar are of a

Abrighter vermilion, as is also the gill-cover.  bluish streak marks the base of the pectoral.

   I am inclined to refer to this species a fish presented to the Cambridge Philosophical Society
by the Rev. George Vachell. Narrow villiform bands of fine short teeth arm the jaws, acute
chevron of the vomer and the palate-bones. The limbs of the preoperculum meet in a right
angle, the extreme corner being slightly rounded and crenated. The barbels reach to the edge

of the gill-opening. Reticulated and strongly ciliated scales cover the body, and the thirty-two
which compose the lateral line are each traversed by a tube having three short branchlets on
its upper side and one belo\^. The line passes the anal before its curve is complete. Most
of the colours have perished, but two faint bars remain on the dorsal, one of the bars having
a black spot in it. Length of fish, 4 inch. Height, 0'9 inch. Length of head, 0'95 inch.

   An example of this species, brought from Canton by John Reeves, Esq., exists in the British
Museum. It belongs to the tribe " without palatine teeth, and with the jaw-teeth widely set
in a single row;" but it has no black spot on the tail. The very short anterior spine of the

first dorsal is not represented in the figure. All the rays of the second dorsal and anal are
jointed. Opercular spines conspicuous, the upper one being short and blunt, the lower one

longer and acute. A dense bushy cluster is formed by the tubes on each scale of the lateral
line. The barbels reach to the inferior part of the gill-opening, and the jaw-teeth are short-

conical. Olive-green is the chief tint on the back and upper parts of the sides, deepest on
the edges of the scales, whose discs, as they approach the flanks, acquire more and more of a
pale reddish hue. These are so arranged as to form two indistinct longitudinal reddish stripes.

--220 REPORT 1845.

The belly is tile-red, while the fins have a colour approaching more to carmine, but the mem-

branes of the ventrals and anal are mostly orpiment-orange. A dull reddish-brown tinges

the front of the head, and a more lively carmine the lips and cornevs of the mouth. Along

the middle of the olive-coloured preorbitar there is a dark streak, and another marks out its

Alower edge.    peach-blossom red spot is placed on the top of the tail immediately behind the

second dorsal.

   An injured specimen of this fish, procured at Canton by the Rev. George Vachell, exists in
the museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and there are two from the same place
in the British Museum, presented by John Reeves, Esq., which differ from the drawing merely
in the black spot on the top of the tail being a little further back. The species belongs to

the same group with biacukatus, which it resembles in figure, and the Chinese appellation i^

the same with a distinctive epithet added.
   The first spine of the dorsal is very short and incumbent on the base of the second, while

the last spine is very small, recumbent and not easily detected, so that only seven may be

reckoned, unless on minute inspection. Joints exist at top of the first ray of the second
dorsal, and the point of the anal spine is flexible. The operculum has two small spinous points,
and its anterior border is striated. The scales are granular and reticulate on their outer
margin, minutely pitted on the disc, and furrowed and granulated towards the base. Each

scale of the lateral line is marked by a little torch, that is, a cluster of many simple or merely

forked short branchlets supported on a thickish tubular stem.
   The colours are pretty well described by Russell. In Mr. Reeves's figure a short blue line

runs from the orbit to the nostril, another borders the preorbitar beneath, and three descend
from the temples to the cheek and gill- cover. The large anterior lateral spot is of a bright
gamboge, and the posterior one is purplish-black. Five orange-coloured streaks cross the

anal obliquely.

This species is allied to suh-vittatus, dubius and others of the saine group which have

banded caudals. Mr. Reeves presented a Canton specimen to the British Museum, and I
have received two from Surgeon R. A. Bankier, R. N., procured at Hong Kong. The short

tubes on the scales of the lateral line are for the most part divided, and one of the branches is

generally notched at the end, while the other emits very short transverse branchlets. The

whole cluster on each scale looks to the naked eye to be merely a club-shaped tube. Narrow

bands of minute, slender but bluntish teeth, arm the jaws and edges of the palate-bones, and

there are still smaller ones on the chevron of the vomer. The barbels reach to the preoper-

Aculum.  more slender fish than vitiatus and less so than tceniopterus. Blackish-green

upper half of the body traversed by a pale streak, commencing at the eye and coincident at
first with the lateral line, but running above it in its course through the tail. Round purplish

dots are distributed equally over the whole body, but are most conspicuous on the lower sil-
very parts. On the cheeks, the specks are dark umber, smaller and not round. The dorsals

are darkish, especially towards their tips, with obscure bars in the specimens, and on the second
the darker colour forms a large blotch. Six dark brown bars cross the caudal. The anal

and ventrals are roseate with round dots, which are deep reddish-brown on the ventrals.

   There remains two of Mr. Reeves's figures, which we are unable to place in their proper
groups from ignorance of their dentition. One of them, named Yung chuey, " Foreign mullet"
(Jco7J. Reeves, a. 44 ; Hardw. 103), has the external form of Up. bensasi, which enters the first
division of the genus, but it wants the bands and spots on the fins of that species.

   The other (Icon. Reeves, 250; Hardw. 104) resembles Up. bilineatus of Quoy and Gai-
mard, in having twro longitudinal streaks, but differs in its more oblique profile and greater
number of fin-rays. Both these and the rest of the species figured by Mr. Reeves, were pro-

cured at Canton.

    Mr. Reeves has deposited the specimen from which his figure was drawn in the British
Museum. It has the form of ^p. trimaculaUis, but scarcely any traces are discernible of the
three black dorsal spots, and the figure wants these spots entirely, liaving a bronzed umber
colour on the back, with pale sides. The pectoral is orange, and the other fins brownish-
purple, all without spots. The Chinese fish has a great similarity to Ap. rex-mullorum, but
its body is a little higher. The spine of the second dorsal is strong. The preoperculnm is
serrated nearly all round, and the villiform bands of teeth on the jaws are shorter and finer
than those oi Ap. rex-mullorum.

  A Canton specimen of this fish, collected by the Rev. George Vachell, belongs to the Cam-

bridge Philosophical Institution, whicli differs from the three noticed in the ' Histoire des
Poissons,' that have no more than nine soft rays in the second dorsal, in having four teeth re-
clining backwards on the hinder part of the orbit. Scaly nape, convexly coped with an acute
mesial line ; the scales coming to a point between the posterior parts of the orbits. Gill-cover

entire and scaly, a single row of large ones on the inter-operculuni, which is also entire. Two

acute edges of the lower limb of preoperculnm beautifully serrated, and the posterior edge of

the upper limb rather openly and slenderly toothed. The corner is rounded, and the fore-

edge of the upper limb is vertical and smooth. Whole edge of the preorbitar spinously toothed.

Eye large ; lower jaw ascending.

   Mr. Reeves's Canton specimen is deposited in the British Museum. Lacepfide, on the
authority of Japanese drawings, named one species of this genus Holocentre & bande blanche,
and another Holocetitre blanc-rouge. On the supposition that the only two Holocentra which
I have met with in collections of Chinese fish are the same two which frequent the seas of
Japan, I have considered his bande blanche as identical with the spinosissimam of the ' Fauna
Japonica,' because of its white stripes. Our enumeration of the fin- rays differs from that
recorded in the work in question j but it is difficult in this genus, without dissection, to distin-
guish between entire rays and branches, especially of the anal fin, and two observers will
scarcely reckon alike. Caudal and anal yellow, the front of latter and sides of former red.

For the reason given above I have referred this Chinese fish to the species named by Lace-

pede. Specimens from Canton exist in the British Museum, presented by John Reeves, Esq.,

and in the museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, by the Rev. George Vachell.

There are also examples of it in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park. Cuvier was inclined

to think that the Japanese painting referred to by Lacepede, was a representation of H. ori-

entate, but a careful examination of the specimens causes me to doubt the correctness of this

opinion and to have recourse to Lacepede's prior appellation.

The infraorbitar chain is finely fringed and unequally toothed throughout, the anterior

point of the preorbitar being armed by one strong curved tooth followed by five or six small

conical ones, differing in appearance from the rest, which are more setaceous. Interoperculum

armed by six or seven teeth, the posterior three being largest. Ribs or longitudinal streaks

of operculum ending in four or five slender points ; the two spines strong and slightly diver-

gent. Vertical edge of preoperculum strongly toothed above the thick, smooth spine ; under
edge also toothed ; the disc smooth. Under jaw and maxillaries streaked in two directions.

Temporal plate streaked and toothed. Posterior frontal rusticated ; from seven to ten striaa on

each side of the hind head ; supra-scapular and scapula finely toothed and furrowed. An acute

tooth of the nasal bone overlies the edge of the intermaxillary ; and there are streaks and a

small tooth  on the supra-axillary plate of  the'coracoid  bone                              thirty-seven  scales  on  lateral

    This fish is intermediate in form, as well as in the numbers of its fin-rays, between Sc. lucida
and Sc. pama (Buch.), and differs considerably in character from the two Atlantic species and
from Sc. japonica, having more the aspect of a Johnius.

   The following particulars are noted from a Canton specimen presented to the British Mu-

--seum by John Reeves, Esq. : Outer teeth of the upper jaw widely set, short, subulate, acute
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

a canine tooth a little stouter than the others on each side of the symphysis ; and a villiform

hand within. On the lower jaw, the subulate teeth are a little taller and slightly curved, with
numerous small ones amongst them, but no distinct interior villiform bands. The maxillary
is strengthened anteriorly by a smooth rib which projects at the tip. Four pores at the end of
the lower javv; and five teeth pointing upwards on the upper limb of the preoperculum. Two
thin, flat, triangular, acute and flexible tips to the operculum, with a cartilaginous prolonga-
tion of the suboperculum extending much beyond them. Anal spine having about one-third
of the length of the soft rays. Scales soft and nacry, the curve of the lateral line terminating

at the tip of the pectoral, but less boldly arched than in the figure. Pectorals, under-parts
of the body, sides of the head, and ventral spine salfron-yellow, the anal showing a reddish-
orange hue. The fish attains a considerable size.

   John Reeves, Esq. presented two Canton specimens of this fish to the British Museum.
They have five pores at the tip of the lower jaw ; a row of subulate teeth on the upper jaw, a
card-like or villiform band within, and a canine tooth near the symphysis. On the lower jaw
there are no villiform bands within the subulate teeth, but two or three rows of minute ones
exterior to them. Maxillary striated, truncated. Preorbitar and snout scaly. Preoperculum
streaked on its border and slightly crenato-dentate. Bony operculum ending in two narrow,
acute, triangular flat points, separated from each other by a deep oblique fissure. First anal
spine almost concealed ; second slender, half the length of the soft rays. Colour generally
dark with much brown, unspotted on body. Two rows of spots between the rays on second
dorsal ; pectorals and lower fins orange.

   This species has the general form of the preceding, but differs from it in having a more
blunt, rounded, and prominent snout, a shorter rounded caudal, approaching less to a rhomb,
and the preoperculum spinously toothed on the upper limb and rounded corner, where the
teeth are large. On its under limb the teeth have the usual crenato-dentate character ob-
served in this genus. The dorsal is more deeply divided than in aureus, and the two equal
tips of the bony operculum are shorter and stronger. The second anal spine, though shorter
than the soft rays, is stout and finely striated ; dentition and pores on chin as in aureus. On
the upper half of the body there are oblique lines which pass some way below the lateral
line. The number of anal rays forbid us to refer this fish to the bispinosus of the ' Histoire des
Poissons,' and it does not agree with the others described in that work. The British Museum
possesses a Chinese specimen obtained from Mr. Reeves, but he does not appear to have had
a drawing made of it.

    In the absence of specimens or figures of the Batavian O. argenteus, the Chinese fish can be

referred to the same species only with doubt. An example of the Chinese fish was presented

to the Cambridge Pliilosophical Institution by the Rev. George Vachell.
   .\n outer row of short, equal subulate teeth, moderately widely set, arm both jaws, and

within the upper ones there is a narrow microscopical villiform band, but none such are per-

ceptible on the lower jaw. A long, curved, and not stoiit canine stands on each side of the

symphysis of each jaw, the upper ones being widely apart, so as to receive the inferior pair be-
tween them. The lower jaw is slightly longer than the snout. Curve of the lateral line
completed opposite to the anus and middle of the second dorsal. The bony operculum is
traversed by two fine ribs whose ends project slightly, the notch between them being inconspi-
cuous. The second anal spine is slender, vieak, and only half the length of the soft rays

the first one is a mere point.

lateral subulate teeth on both jaws, more closely set in the lower one. By aid of a lens, a

narrow band of villiform teeth can be detected within the others above ; and beneath there are
a few intermixed with the principal ones. Some striae are visible on the end of the maxillary

and there are depressions on the lower jaw, but no pores could be detected. The preoper-
culum is armed feebly by small acute teeth, and the bony operculum shows two narrow points
separated from each other by a fissure. The fish is pale and silvery, with a light bluish gray
tint along the back. The lower half of the caudal, front of the anal, ventrals, and the pectorals
are gall-stone yellow. The rest of the fins are pale and spotless, the upper half of the caudal
alone being deeper and approaching to blackish-gray.

Most of the collections of Chinese fish that we have examined contain examples of a Corvina,

which with the general aspect of C. coitor of Buchanan Hamilton (pi. 27. f. 24), has a
straighter profile and a shorter and blunter snout that curves downwards from the nostrils,

much like that of Umbrina vulgaris ; it seenfs to be allied to Scitsna lucida. Upper jaw armed

by a concave densely villiform plate of teeth with a stronger subulate outer i-ow, brownish at the

tips, which are even ; on the lower jaw the villiform plate is boldly convex. Minute pores exist
on the snout, and there are five large pores at the end of the lower jaw. The scaly preorbitar

receives beneath its edge, the entire maxillary and all the intermaxillary except the dental

Amargin.    deep recess exists on the outside of the maxillary pedicles, and a little triangular

point of the preorbitar lip hangs over it. The limbs of the lower jaw are scaly, and thin bony

ridges of the suborbitar chain cross the scaly cheek. The preoperculum is bounded towards

the cheek by a smooth bony edge ; its posterior edge is free and is widely set with slender

subulate teeth, the most distinct ones being the tips of ribs which cross the disc of the bone.

Interoperculum entii-e, mostly concealed beneath the preoperculum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              suboperculum also entire,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

rather narrow. Two low even diverging ribs cross the operculum and end in points which are

scarcely pungent, and the edge of bone between them is nearly even. Lateral line formed by

a series of simple tubes, boldly arched anteriorly, and becoming straight in the tail by a gra-

dual sweep ending opposite the beginning of the anal. Scales tender, nacry, and very deci-

duous. Second anal spine not strong, a little shorter than the soft rays. Caudal subrhomboidal.

Ventrals with a short filamentous tip. Colour mostly silvery, with some yellow tints on fore

part of anal, ventrals, and pectorals. Length about 7 inches.

   The British Museum possesses a mounted specimen of this fish and one in spirits, both
brought from Canton by Mr. Reeves. Russell says that the Coromandel fishermen take this
to be the male of C. catalea. The differences in the numbers of the rays of the fins seem to
render it expedient to keep them distinct ; the snout of this is more obtuse ; like the pre-
ceding, it has five pores on the lower jaw ; the second anal spine is only half the length of the

soft rays.

    This is apparently a Corvina with stronger teeth than the other species in Mr. Reeves's port-

one described in the ' Histoire des Poissons ' by the short accounts of the species therein men-
tioned. The base of the second dorsal is marked by a row of black dots, one on each ray.
The o-eneral colour is silvery with pale bluish-gray on the discs of the scales, the gray tint
deepening along the dorsal line. Pectorals, fronts of the ventrals and anal and lobes of the
caudal, more or less deeply tinged with orange or yellow. First dorsal darker than the other
fins, but there are no spots except the row on the base of the second dorsal.

   Notvfithstanding the difference in the numbers of the dorsal rays, I have ventured to refer
this Chinese fish to the Scieena gaterina of Forskal. Riippell's figure differs from the one in
the ' Histoire des Poissons ' considerably in the steepness of the profile. Mr. Reeves's dravping
is in this respect most like the latter, but in the form and distribution of its spots it has more
resemblance to Riippell's figure. The Chinese collection at Hyde Park contains a specimen

Riippell's ' Atlas.' The Chinese collection at Hyde Park contains a specimen. It has three

   Mr. Reeves's China specimen is in the British Museum. It greatly resembles nngeh, but
has a more convex profile, and differs in its markings. It has a row of seven roundish dark
spots or short transverse bars along the back above the lateral line, in which respect it differs
from P. giioraca, whose form is not dissimilar. No pores were detected on the lower jaw.
The teeth on the jaws are villiform, the dental surface being narrower on the upper jaw, and
bounded by an outer row of short subulate teeth. The roof of the mouth is toothless. Space
round the nostrils and jaws nacry ; all the opercular pieces and the cheek scaly. Disc of pre-
operculum broad, its outline parabolic and its posterior edge toothed, the teeth being more
remote at the corner. The figure, which is otherwise a good representation of the specimen,

does not bring the curve of the preoperculum far enough back. A band of small scales crosses

the nape from one scapula to the other ; the second anal is longer and stronger than the
third one. This species is similar in its markings to Mesoprion johnii, Bl. 3 IS, but the spe-
cimen has no vomerine nor palatine teeth. (C. et V.)

   The figure in the ' Fauna Japonica' represents a fish with a considerably lower body than
the Chinese, which we have referred to that species on account of its agreement in all other
respects with the characters of the species. The British Museum received a Chinese specimen
from John Reeves, Esq. Second and third anal spines equal and striated. The scales are small.

   Of this fish we have seen no specimen. It has the thickish lips and preoperculum of a
Pristipoma and the even dorsal oi Pr.japonicum. The scales are larger than in that species,

and the second anal spine is conspicuously longer and stronger than the third one. A greenish-

gray tint, approaching where most intense to olive-green, pervades the upper parts of the
body and the vertical fins, being deepest on the discs of the scales, Avhich have silvery mar-
gins. The sides are paler and are glossed by auricula-purple, and the lips, cheeks, and pectoral
and ventral fins are lavender-purple without spots anywhere.

   Of this also I have seen no specimen : judging from the figure, it seems to approach
Pr.japonicum, but its scales are larger and its dorsal more notched. Its lower fins are orange
and its caudal lobes tipped with carmine, the body generally silvery and the fins unspotted.
It is possible that this may be the Hcemulon mentioned by Dr. Cantor as frequenting the
estuary of the Peiho. It has carmine blotches on the lips like HcEinulon.

    Several examples of a Chinese fish strongly resembling the preceding exist in the Chinese
collection at Hyde Park and in the British Museum, but differing from it in having a preoper-
cular notch and subopercular knob, both sHghter than is usual in Diacope. Neither the spe-
cimens nor drawing agree sufficiently with Russell's figure 110 {Mesoprion quinquelineatus,
C. et v.), nor 98 {Diacope notata, C. et V.), nor with Bloch's M.johnii (318), to be referred
to either of them.

   The canine teeth in the upper jaw are acute and well-apart. In the lower jaw there is a
short one in the middle of the limb on each side. The vomerine and palatine teeth are covered

by the horizontal velum. The preorbitar and lower jaw are studded with minute pores. A

small pit exists on the chin. The scales of the cheek form an oval oblique band extending
from the temples to near the corner of the mouth, bounded above by smooth integument,
which spreads over the preorbitar and below by the disc of the preoperculum. Preoperculum
having a broad disc coarsely toothed at the corner, some of the inferior teeth pointing forward
under limb serrated ; operculum with two obtuse lobes. The darker discs of the scales form
rows of faint spots. Second and third anal spines about equal in length, the second one a little
the stoutest, and neither of them equal to the soft rays in length.

   This is one of the Serrani which bear a close resemblance to merra, and are perhaps merely
varieties of that species. It is a common fish in the southern seas, yet I have not been able

to identify it with any of the numerous species or varieties described in the ' Histoire des
Poissons.' In the British Museum there are examples from China and North Australia which

do not differ from each other.

   This is another merou, almost identical in the markings of its body and fins with gilberti,
but distinguished from it and from merra by the greater size of its pectoral fin, which is edged
with black and reaches beyond the anus. The only species described in the ' Fauna Japonica'
which resembles this, is the S. epistictus, and that has the spots on the fore part of the body
ranged in three rows, which coalesce into one row posteriorly. The " tortoise-shell merou"
grows to the length of a foot. There are examples of it in the Chinese collection at Hyde
Park and in the British Museum, the latter presented by Mr. Reeves.

I have been strongly inclined to consider this fish as identical with the preceding one, but

nothing is said in the ' Fauna Japonica' of the dark bars which cross the body, and which are

very evident both in the dried specimens and in those preserved in spirits. The species ap-

Wepears to be common in the China seas and to attain the size of 16 or 18 inches.  have

seen examples of it in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park, the British Museum, and the

Cambridge Philosophical Institution.

Teeth rather small, each intermaxillary armed by a curved canine. In the lower jaw the

canines are longer, and the outer row is composed of subulate teeth set widely. The chevron

of the vomer is acute and small, and the dental bands of the palate bones are narrow and

feebly toothed. The limbs of the preoperculum meet at rather less than a right angle, the upper

one slightly convex and acutely toothed, the lower one almost straight, with microscopical cre-

natures. In some specimens, the coarse teeth at the angle of the bone are divided by a notch

into two groups, in others there are two strong divergent teeth at the angle ; the bone is densely
scaly up to the teeth. In Mr. Reeves's figure the preoperculum is shown of too parabolic a

form. The operculum ends in three acute teeth, the middle one being the largest; the tip of

the gill-cover is slender and acute small scales cover the lower jaw, and the scales on the body
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

are strongly ciliated ; the lateral line is conspicuous and formed of a series of tubes, one on
each scale inclined upwards, and the fins are scaly to near their tips. Five or six dark bars

cross the sides, two of them running up on the spinous dorsal, and two on the soft fin, which

is also traversed in the middle by a cross-bar. The bars are irregular in form, and the caudal

fin is crossed by two or three less distinct ones. The body and head are marked by round red
spots, much as aka-ara is represented to be in the ' Fauna Japonica,' and there are some

larger faint red marks on the spinous dorsal. The anal and pectoral are both crossed by dusky

bars or clouds, and the ventrals are edged with the same. All the under-parts of the head and

body are auvora-red. The Chinese name has been attached to this species as a provisional

designation until the suspicion above-mentioned of its identity with the aka-ara be proved or

disproved.

Were it not for the small number of rays in the soft dorsal indicated in the figure here

quoted, I should have no hesitation in saying that it is the representation merely of a young

individual of the shih pan. The cross bands, however, are fewer, broader and fainter. The

buff-coloured ground tint and the deep orange-red spots are the same in both. In the varie-

gatus these spots form two rows on both the spinous and soft parts of the dorsal, and also on

the upper half of the tail ; and there are two black spots with pale borders on the latter fin.

All the vertical fins are obscurely clouded or banded, and the pectorals are buff-coloured with

Weorange borders and black bases.     have seen no specimen that corresponds to this figure,

which measures 5^ inches.

   The spots of this figure are singularly like those of S. hexagonatus (Forster, C. et V. ii.
p. 330), but the angles of the meshes want the bright white spots ; there is a more decided
notch in the preopeiculum, and the third anal spine is longer than the second. The ground
colour is pale aurora-red, the spots orange-brown, and the head and body are clouded by
about twelve large brown patches on each sidR. The spots are equally crowded on all the fins,
but are rather rounder than on the body. They are slightly deeper than the ground tint on
the pectorals, which is like that of the body, but clearer. The other fins have a brownish
hue, and the spots on the dorsal and ventrals are umber-brown, and on the caudal and anal au-
ricula-purple ; the ground tint of the latter fins being also dark. The upper tip of the caudal
is lighter: that fin is truncated or slightly rounded. The lower jaw projects considerably be-
yond the upper one. Length of the figure 10 inches.

differs in the number of rays, and is said to belong to the true Serrani with naked jaws, while

this is a Merou.

    The teeth are small and fine, but with a canine on each side of the symphysis of the upper
jaw. No scales on the upper jaw or maxillary, but the snout is scaly even before the nostrils,
and scales exist on the preorbitar and suborbitars,and cover the preoperculum toitsextreme edge.
The lower jaw is furnished with small, deeply imbedded scales. Preoperculum curved in the arc
of a circle, and minutely toothed in a pectinated manner on its upper limb, a little coarser at the

angle. Gill-cover very obtuse, or cut nearly vertically with a slightly projecting tip opposite
the central spine, which is thin and flat. Lateral line considerably arched. Fins rounded

and covered with small scales. The anal has three stout spines, shorter than the soft rays.
    The colour is pale chestnut, with eight well-defined and regular, darker vertical bands,

which encroach a little on the dorsal. The head and fins are mostly of the colour of the bands
the tips of the dorsal and edges of the pectoral and anal dark. The soft dorsal has a pale edge,

and the upper edge of the caudal is pale, the under one dark. A round black spot occupies

the membrane filling the sinus between the two upper opercular spines.

   A specimen of this fish was brought from the Chinese seas by Sir Edward Belcher, which is

much better represented by Riippell's figure than by those given in the other works we have
quoted. The figure in the ' Voy. of the Coquille' wants the blue edging of the fins, and has
more resemblance even in the colouring to the Serranus rogaa of Riippell than to myriaster.

    This drawing has a general resemblance to S. myriaster, but with a more arched nape, a
higher spinous dorsal, a projecting point at the corner of the preoperculum, much smaller and
differently disposed dots. The general colour is flax-flower-blue, deepening to indigo on the
back, and having purplish tints on the face and breast. The spots are small, bluish-black, and
extend to all the fins, except the pectoral and anal. They become gradually less on the lower
parts of the sides and disappear on the breast and belly. The pectorals are yellowish-gray,
with blue bases ; but the rest of the fins are blue like the body, the extremity of the caudal
being also tinged with blue and the anal with purple. The fins do not show the marginal
streak so evident in myriaster. The caudal is truncated.

    Minute scales cover the entire surface of the maxillary, except the folds of the lips ; and the
fins are densely scaly. The general tint of the body, dorsal and base of the anal is reddish-
orange, the gill-cover being tinged with siskin-green. The body is traversed by numerous
china-blue lines, which are oblique on the back, but horizontal on the sides. They run out
upon the dorsal and anal, changing to sap-green. Six of the blue lines cross the face, radiating
 from round the orbit, and there are some blue spots before the eye and on the lips. The rays
 of the ventrals are partly blue, partly green ; the outer half of the anal is green, and it has a
border of blue and black. The pectorals and anal are dark prussian-blue, their rays being
 paler. Russell's plate omits the lines on the spinous dorsal, gives a wrong direction to those
 on the anal, and represents all the lines as too broad. Mr. Reeves's drawing is an excellent
representation of a specimen in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park.

by its possessing a row of five or six irregular, whitish and indistinct spots on the flanks. Mr.
Reeves's fig\ire shows vertical bands in pairs, faint, and merely a little paler than the rest of
the red colour, but no spots. There are Chinese specimens in spirits in the British Museum
and Chinese collection at Hyde Park, which offer no tangible difference when compared with
a dried specimen of Biirger's, also in the British Museum. Neither could we detect any dis-
crepancy betwixt the Chinese specimens and one obtained at Copang, in the island of Timor,
by Mr. Gilbert.

    Judging solely from the description of S. oceanicus in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' in the
absence of authentic specimens or good figures, it appears to be the same with marginalis ; but
the Perca fasciata of Forskal, referred by Cuvier to oceanicus, is probably a different species.
Its dorsal and anal fins are edged with yellow, and it is evidently the same with the Perca
rulescens of Solander, of which a drawing by Parkinson (No. 61) exists in the Banksian
Library.

   We have seen no specimen corresponding with Mr. Reeves's drawing 255 (Hardw. Acanth.

anal spines are however proportionally larger, and its cheek and gill-cover are glossed with
green. The Chinese name is Hing pau yu, "Red garoupa."

   Two young individuals of this species, which Surgeon Bankier has sent from Hong Kong,
have the lateral stripe darker than in older individuals, and a black mark swelling round that

part of it which is under the middle of the soft dorsal, as in some Diacopes and Mesoprions.
 There is scarcely any notch in the preoperculum either in the young or old, and the suboper-
cular knob is very indistinct. The denta) plate of the vomer is rhomboidal, and the habit of
the fish is not that o( Serranus, neither is it more like Diacope.

    This is compared with hepatus in the ' Fauna Japonica,' and is described as possessing a
 round black spot between tlie two upper opercular spines.

    The British Museum possesses a Canton specimen presented to it by Mr. Reeves, which we

 are inclined to consider as the kawamebari, though it wants the black opercular spot. It has the
 scaleless jaws and narrow, naked preopercular disc of the true Serrani. The upper limb of the
 preoperculum is nearly vertical, slightly arched, finely toothed, with four or five stronger di-
 vergent teeth at the squarish angle, and a horizontal toothless under limb. Lateral line slightly
 arched. Fins delicate, rounded. Ground colour pale brown, marbled with irregular darker
 confluent spots. The sides are traversed by six bars inclining forwards as they descend, and
 rendered paler by the absence of the spots which fill the interspaces. On the head the same
 colours, but the pale bands are longitudinal. Three dark lines cross the cheek obliquely from
 the eye to the angle of the gill-cover. The dorsal is obscurely clouded with a dark point be-
 hind the tip of each spine: the soft dorsal and anal are darkish, the pectoral nearly colour-
 less. Length of specimen 6 inches.

that of the Tang or Taa, a South Australian Serranus.

    In general form and in the distribution of its coloured bands and spots, this species bears
a singular resemblance to Diagramma einctum, as has been already noticed {supra, p. 226).
Body thickest a little below the arched lateral line, and thinning off above to the acute nape
and dorsal line. The belly is obtuse, and the top of the cranium widens gradually until it
becomes flat between the fore parts of the orbits. Chin and edge of the lower jaw covered by
a soft papillose lip ; upper lip less coarsely papillose. Four small pores on the chin and two
on each limb of the lower jaw, whose articulation is under the fore part of the orbit. Jaw-
teeth villiforni, the outer row short-conical and acute. Roof of the mouth toothless, lined
with plaited, villous membranes, the villi being densely crowded behind the crescentic velum.

   Maxillary truncated with a small point at the fore corner. Preoperculum strongly and
                                                                                       ;;

rather widely toothed on both limbs, the teeth at the corner coarser. Gill-cover short and
triangular, with a sub-acute, triangular bony tip, and an oblique, acute notch above it. No
scales on the lower jaw, but the fore part of the maxillary and the preorbitar and suborbitar
chain, with the rest of the side of the head up to the extreme edges of the gill-cover, are finely

scaly. Supra-scapular spinously toothed.

   The scales are rough like those of a Priacanthus. The lateral line is arched to under the
third dorsal spine, when it descends, and is a little undulated under the soft dorsal. No
scales on the spinous dorsal ; but the bases of the soft dorsal, anal, pectoral and caudal are scaly.

A stout recumbent spine precedes the soft dorsal. Second anal spine much stronger and

larger than the third, which does not much exceed the first one.
    Scales generally bright and silvery: a bright silvery border edges the lower part of the

operculum, and the cheek is also bright, but the rest of the head has a dark neutral tint or
bluish-gray. The upper half of the body, the tail and the vertical fins are marked by round
spots of the same. There is also a bluish-gray band on the hind head, another descending
from the nape to behind the pectoral, and a third, descending from the anterior half of the
spinous dorsal, curves when it reaches the lateral line backwards along the tail, much like the
curved band oi Diacope sebee. The ground colour of the pectorals, spinous, dorsal and caudal
is sienna- or ochre-yellow ; that of the soft dorsal and anal olive-green. Ventrals hair- brown,
edged like the spinous dorsal with brownish-black. Length A^ inches.

  A specimen of Biirger's in the British Museum, which is doubtless an example of this spe-

cies, though it was labelled when received from Berlin Pogonias melanopterus, diflfers from the
figure in the ' Fauna Japonica,' in having a rather less concave profile and a somewhat differ-
ently shaped profile. It has a recumbent spine before the dorsal, which is not noticed by its
describers, and the scales which partially cover the dorsal are omitted in the figure they have
given. The species differs from the other members of the genus named above, in the papillae
of the under-lip being sufficiently elongated to produce a beard, and it therefore stands in the
same relation to them that Pogonias does to Micropogon.

spirits and lost its plumpness and height. The vertical bands are also fainter in the drawing,

and the fins have a deep safFron-yellow or Dutch-orange colour instead of the pale primrose

tint shown in the ' Fauna Japonica.' Teeth villiform with an outer row of stouter ones.

   Though this drawing does not exhibit the peculiar suborbitar tooth of the genus, I am in-

to refer it to Scolopsides ; and if this reference be correct, it possesses specific marks in the jet
black tip of the gill-cover, and in a black speck on the base of the upper pectoral ray. It has
the yellow fins and bright carmine spot on the gill-cover of the preceding species ; but its back
is browner and its profile undulated. Length of the drawing 6 inches.

strongly striated. Outer row of teeth subulato-conical, inclined backwards, rather taller on
the sides of the lower jaw. Within the upper jaw a narrow band of granular teeth. On the
lower jaw the interior teeth are in a single row and very minute. In the drawing the sides
and head are densely clouded with blackish purple mixed on the base of the fins, and towards
the lower parts with siskin-green. The soft dorsal, anal and caudal are blacker, and the lat-
ter is edged obscurely above and below with yellow or pale green. The pectoral is clay-
coloured; the ventrals and spinous dorsal clouded with neutral tint. Length 12 inches.

   This species has the pale bar on the extremity of the caudal fin and some other colours
ascribed to Lobotes erate in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' particularly to the specimens which
M. Dussumier brought from the coast of Malabar (v. p. 323); but the height of the body is
greater, being equal to half the length of the fish, caudal fin excluded, and I have therefore
thought it expedient to give it a provisional specific name. The Chinese collection at Hyde
Park contains specimens which I have very cursorily examined. The ground colour in Mr.
Reeves's drawing is dull lemon-yellow, with obscure purplish clouding, a purplish black shading
round the eye, on the tip of the gill-cover, the nape and bases of the vertical fins and pec-
torals. The pectorals are pale and transparent, the rest of the fins are blackish, more or less
clouded, and the soft dorsal and anal are bordered with buff-orange.

There is some difBculty in discovering ready characters by wliicli the Priacanthi may be

distinguished from one another. In tlie publislied descriptions much stress has been laid on

tlie form and size of the angular projection of the preoperculum, but this varies greatly on

different sides of the same individual, and in the ' Fauna Japonica' it is stated that there is a

variation in this part as well as in the relative size of the fins, depending on the age of the

individual. The fish at present under consideration may perhaps eventually prove to belong

to the preceding species, should the elongation of the tips of the caudal and peak of the dorsal

be discovered to be merely a sexual peculiarity or the more perfect state of the fish. One
specimen exists in the museum of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, to which it was pre-

sented by the Rev. George Vachell, and another in the British Museum, received from John

Reeves, Esq., both obtained at Canton.

fourth soft ray of the dorsal is lengthened into a short filiform tip, the posterior corner of the

fin being rounded ; the anal is much rounded and about half the height of the body ; caudal

forked, with the tips acute and lengthened, particularly the upper one in Mr. Reeves's spe-

cimen ; but in Mr. Vachell's, the upper tip only is a liitle larger than the rest of the fin, and is
nearly straight on the edge ; pectoral considerably smaller than in benmebari, and rounded

ventrals large ; the scales silvery and bright. In the figure a bright carmine colour runs along
the base of the dorsal, and gradually fades away as it descends the sides, which are silvery;

the same is the case on the head ; a faint roseate tint spreads over the dorsal, the edge being

deeper ; the anal and ventrals are pale blue, the latter being rose-coloured towards the edges,
and marked by about eight rovi-s of brown spots, with two larger round ones in the membrane

which connects the last ray with the belly as far as the anus ; the pectorals and caudal are

siskin-green and rose-coloured. One specimen 4^ inches, the other 9^ inches.

The Priacanthus speculum of the Seychelle islands is stated in the ' Histoire des Poissons'

We(vii. p. 471) to be readily distinguished from other species by its forked caudal.                                                                                                                                         are

prevented from considering it as identical with the Chinese fish, by the eye being a full dia-

meter of the orbit from the edge of the snout, the extreme smallness of the preopercular

point, and the absence of the round spots on the pectoral. In the latter character iayeiius

agrees more nearly though not perfectly with benmebari. In the angular or pointed dorsal

it resembles _;a^on!C(«.

This figure looks very much like a second representation oi cardinalis, the only differences

I can perceive being its rather larger head, the third anal spine rather shorter than the second

   A Canton specimen of this fish, presented to the British Museum by Mr. Reeves, has three

longish, subulate, somewhat incurved teeth on each intermaxillary, and five rows of small upper
molars; the interior rows being short, and the last three teeth of the third row bigger than the
rest, but not exceeding swan-shot; there is the usual crowd of small teeth behind the incisors,
and four rows of the lower molars. Preorbitar twice as long as it is high. Preopercular
disc faintly striated. Operculum ending in a small flat truncated point, with the bone sloped

away above and below, where the edge is more concave than above. A row of crenated and

striated, but not very conspicuous nuchal scales. The dorsal spines swell out on alternate sides,
and the second anal spine is longer and stronger than the third one, which equals the soft
rays. The height of the body is contained two times and a half in the total length, and the
profile rises with little convexity and no undulation from the upper lip to the dorsal. The fal-
cate pectoral, which is rather too short in the figure, reaches to the anal. The colour is brightly
silvery, with ash-gray shadings on the base of the scales. The dorsal and upper half of the
caudal are also gray with darker shadings on their borders. The lower half of the caudal and

the other fins are saffron-yellow. Length of figure 7J inches.

   Mr. Reeves has deposited a specimen of this fish also in the British Museum. In form
it is very similar to the last, except that the profile bulges a little at the orbit. The
colours also are nearly the same, the back showing merely a deeper tint of yellowish-gray with
some green on the nape and parts of the head ; the yellow of the lower fins also is more
vivid. The specimen has only two short conical canines on each intermaxillary and five rows
of mokrs, the largest, which are those of the middle row, not exceeding partridge-shot. The
canines are very short in the lower jaw, and there are only three rows of molars to be clearly

*made out. Preorbitar as in auripes, and with thin papyraceous edge. Preoperculum

striated on the disc, and minutely but regularly serrated along the upper limb. Flat point of
the operculum rather more prominent than in auripes, and much like the corresponding
point in a Scolopsides. Middle anal spine long and strong as in auripes, and the pectoral
long. Length of the figure 8^ inches.

margin of the jaw; and a little way behind them a brush-like band of much smaller teeth,

which are also tricuspid, and like the others except in size. Preoperculum minutely serrated
on the edge and radiately ridged on the disc. Lower part of gill-cover and suboperculum

smooth and sealeless. Operculum ending in two thin, flat, widely separated corners. Scales
strongly ptenoid, pale, with dark borders, and resembling melon-seed. The prevailing colour
of Mr. Reeves's figure is umber-brown, deeper above the lateral line and on the dorsal fin. The

other fins are blackish-gray, the pectoral having a yellow edge. The iris bright blue. Cau-

dal even.

   The authors of the ' Fauna Japonica' have named this species as the type of a peculiar
genus, but have not assigned any strong reason for separating it from Crenidens. They who

agree with them in thinking that the group ought to be subdivided, should observe that Mr.
Gray's generic name Girella is prior to the Melanichthys of the ' Fauna Japonica.' In Mr.
Reeves's drawing the general colour is black and blaokish-purple, with purer purple tints on
the face. The caudal is glossed with purplish- brown, the soft dorsals, anal and pectorals,
with deep blackish green, and the ventrals, spinous dorsal and spines of the anal, with auricula-
purple. The eyes are green. These various shades of dark colours give a general blackish
aspect to the fish. In the illumination of the figure in the ' Fauna Japonica ' the colour is
black, the greenish and purple tints being omitted, as they are in a drawing made by Deputy-
Assistant Commissary General Neill, oi Crenidens tephmops, a Western- Australian fish, which
agrees nearly in outline with the Japanese fish. (Ichth. Ereb. and Terror, pi. 41. f. 1, 2.) The

Australian names are Kotuelany and Memon.
    Another Western-Australian fish, similar in profile, has the body thinning off like a wedge

towards the belly, and is known to the settlers by the name of " Zebra-fish," on account of
nine black vertical bars on the sides. Its local names are Kgummul and Karraway, " The

striped."

   A third Australian fish having the same local name oi Memon, and another also o{ Muddier,

has more of a Scaroid aspect than the preceding, but yet appears to be of the same genus.

A scale which accompanies Mr. Neill's drawing has the same form and ptenoid structure with

those of the preceding two Australian fish. The caudal is truncated, with the side-points pro-
jecting to the length of one-third of the fin, and the intermaxillaries and raaxillaries ? are set
by a close row of large trenchant teeth. The colour is black, marbled with sky-blue and a
brownish-red tint on the breast. The ventrals blackish-gray and blue ; the other fins black.
The figure is twenty-one inches long. Mr. Neill's drawings of these and many other Austra-
lian fish are contained in a volume which he presented to the British Museum. The ' Ichthy-
ology of the Voyage of the Erebus and Terror' (p. 36, pi. 25. f. 2) contains a description and
figure of Crenidens triglyphus, a Port Jackson fish which has the physiognomy of Crenidens
forslcalii, while the group of Melanichthys approaches more to the Pomacentridce in general

 aspect.

   A specimen of this fish from Canton was presented to the Cambridge Philosophica^l Spciety

by the Rev. George Vachell. The profile of the snout is somewhat gibbous before the eye.
 The teeth are deeply notched, the cusps unequal and crenated. The preoperculum is marked
 at its angle by three or four diverging furrows, and a few small scales are sunk in the integu-
 ment of the cheek close to its bend. The lateral line is composed of a series of short simple
 tubes not very close. Eye rather large. The drawing is grass-green on the upper parts and
 on the dorsal and caudal fins, the colour fading to mountain-green and bluish-gray as it de-
 scends the sides. Many oval silvery spots are scattered over the sides. The spinous dorsal is
 narrowly edged with blackish-gray ; there are dots of that colour on the rays, and the anal and

 ventrals are spotted or barred with the same. The pectorals are pale green at the base, passing
 into a clay colour on the disc of the fins. The belly and sides of the head have much silvery
 lustre. Length 7 inches. The green changes to brown in spirits.

Park. The post-frontal is ridged in a radiated way and slightly cancellated, and no scales
could be discovered through the varnish on the cheeks or temples. The teeth are strongly
tricuspid, the larger middle lobe rounded and crenated, the lateral ones acute. In the draw-
ing an accessory or binate anal spine is shown, and the same thing is noticed by Park in his
description of Amph. murgatitiferus. Tlie body is clouded with umber-brown and silvery
blotches, occupying nearly equal space, but a dark tint prevailing on the back. On the flanks
and tail there are besides many small silvery dots. The throat is umber-brown, and the
sides of the head are umber-brown and olive-green, shading into each other. The caudal,
soft dorsal, posterior half of the spinous part and soft anal are chestnut-brown. A cream-
yellow stripe runs along the base of the anal. The ventrals, fore-part of the dorsal, and
spinous portion of the anal are bluish-gray, and the pectorals straw-yellow with an umber-
brown blotch on the base. Length 10 inches.

brought from Canton by the Rev. George Vachell, and there are several in the Chinese col-
lection at Hyde Park, all of which vary from one another in the size of the spots, which in
some are bigger than the orbit, in others less. Mr. Reeves's drawing shows much larger
spots, and a more concave and sloping profile than Russell's figure. The colour is also more
purpurascent, sombre and dingy than it is described to be in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' so
that it may possibly represent a distinct species.

    This drawing has exactly the profile of Russell's figure of argus, but the dorsal spines are
rather lower, and the second anal spine considerably larger than the others. The colour is
lemon-yellow with a bright golden lustre, becoming silvery towards the belly, much of the
head and parts of the fins being shaded by deep liver-brown. There are also some fainter
large brown marks on the upper half of the body. In form this figure agrees with the de-
scription of Bougainvillii, of which the true colours and markings are not known, the speci-
men described in the ' Histoire des Poissons' having been badly preserved.

I tead an account of the genus Hoplegnathus before the Zoological Society, on the 9th 6f

March, 1841, which was noticed shortly afterwards in the Zoological Proceedings, and sub-

Asequently published at length, with a figure, in the Zoological Transactions.  fasciculus

of the ' Fauna Japonica,' which was published towards the end of the year 1844, gives an

account of the same genus under the name of Scarodon, and mentions the earliest represen-

tation of a species in the Atlas of ' Krusehstern's Voyage.' The specimen described in the

Zoological Transactions was supposd to be Australian, and differs from all the Chinese spe-

cies in its more oblong form. 1 counted only five branchiostegous rays in the only example

--(a dried skin) which I had an opportunity of examining. The rays were as follows : Br. 5?

   Not having examined the specimens in the Chinese collection and compared them with one
another, this is propounded only provisionally as a separate species. In Mr. Reeves's draw-
ings the spots are of two sizes, many smaller ones being scattered among others of the same
dimensions with those oi punctatus. More rays are shown in the soft dorsal and anal than in
the figure of that species. The profile is less gibbous at the eyes, and the ventrals are smaller
but on the whole the two drawings are very much alike and may be both representations of
one species.

    This Mullet has a close resemblance in form to japonicus, but as it is a little more slender
and its colours dififer, we have given it a distinct name. The snout is represented as pro-
jecting beyond the lower jaw, which shuts close up beneath it. The back is coloured pale
 leek-green, the sides and belly being silvery and pearly, with a short dark streak in the
 middle of each scale, making six or seven rows, none being perceptible below the middle of
 the fish. There are some hyacinth-red tints on the face and edges of the gill-pieces, and a
 pale-blue shading in the middle of the operculum. The pectoral is honey-yellow, very dark
at the base and pale at the end. The membrane of the first dorsal is very pale-red lilac ; the
 second dorsal is wood-brown ; the ventrals and anal buff-orange, the latter having an opake
 white bar at its base. The caudal is gamboge-yellow with a crimson border in the notch.

     In Sir Edward Belcher's collection, which was formed chiefly in the China seas, though
 specimens from other parts of the ocean were mixed with the fish there taken, I find a Mugil
 having a close resemblance to Mr. Reeves's drawing above quoted, except that the belly is
 rather more prominent. The upper lip is more fleshy and the orifice of the mouth consider-
 ably larger than in M. strongylocephalus, exceeding the size of the orbit in both directions.
 The under lip is horizontal with a slightly notched keel, and the teeth, which penetrate it,
 are sufl3ciently visible to the naked eye. The slender maxillary is visible nearly for its whole
 length when the mouth is closed, but it scarcely projects beyond the preorbitar, which has a
 straight front edge finely toothed, and ends in a point formed by a tooth larger than the rest.
  It is the tapering narrow form of this bone, and not a notch, which prevents it from concealing
 the maxillary. The length of the head and height of the body are equal, and rather exceed
 a fifth of the length of the fish. The pectorals are contained six times and three-quarters in
  the same length, and the lobes of the caudal four times and a third. The thickness at the gill-
  plates is equal to two-thirds of the height of the body, but under the first dorsal the thickness
  is less than half the height. There are thirty-seven scales in a row, besides some small ones
  on the caudal, and eleven rows under the first dorsal. Each scale has eight or ten fan-like
  furrows diverging from a small tube before the middle of the disc, and the free border of the
  scale is tessellated by worn teeth, which, though minute, show on the edge. There are
  none of the branching lines seen in the scale oi strongylocephalus, in which also the only ap-
  pearance of ptenoid structure is obscure and confined to the middle of the disc. The second
  dorsal and anal are scaly, and the latter commences a little sooner and ends a little further
  from the caudal. The caudal is also minutely scaly almost to the tips of its lobes. The top
  of the head is flat from the preoperculum forwards, but is much narrower than that oimacro-
  Icpidotiis ; the nape is flatly rounded. There are the usual long scales at the first dorsal,
  above the pectoral and ventrals, and between the latter, but none of them are very conspicuous.
  The remains of a blue mark on the front base of the pectorals and a purple tint in the axilla
  are still visible in the specimen, which differs from ctsruleo-maculatus and axillaris in the
   pectorals not being long or pointed.

      In Mr. Reeves's drawing, the top of the head, a circle round the eye, and the borders of the
   gill-pieces are dark oil-green ; the top of the liack is greenish-gray, and the sides silvery, with
  a yellowish-gray line through the middle of each row of scales. The pectorals are orpiment-
  orange with a blue mark on the scaly base, and the other fins are greenish-gray. Length of
   specimen 7'7 inches; from snout to gill-opening, 1-65 inch ; to anus, 4 inches ; to end of
   scales on base of caudal, 6- 15. Height under the first dorsal, 7'55. Thickness at gill-plates,
   0"95. Between the orbits, 0'65. Thickness of back under the first dorsal, 0'70 inch.

       It is probable that this species is the Mullet referred to by Dr. Cantor as inhabiting the
   Peiho, and supposed by him to be the Mugil parsia of Buchanan Hamilton (Ganges, pi. 17.

The Haslar Museum possesses an example of this fish, procured at Hong Kong by Surgeon

R. A. Bankier, R.N. The orifice of the extended mouth is small and triangular, the lips are

thin with acute edges, the lower one being horizontal with a central notched keel. The teeth
are invisible to the naked eye, but with a lens their points may be seen protruding through

the edges of the lips like fine hairs. The jaws have considerable protractility, and when

thrust out, the maxillaries are wholly seen ; but when the mouth is retracted they are com-
pletely hidden. The preorbitar is very narrow, with a rounded and finely toothed tip, behind

which a smooth shallow groove turns round the edge of the bone, giving it a twisted appear-

ance ; but there is no distinct notch and no teeth on the fore-edge of the bone. In profile

the fish has considerable resemblance to the macrolepidotus of Riippell (Atlas, 35. f. 2), but

when seen from above, its snout, though rounded, is much narrower, being little more than

half as wide as the head is at the gill-covers. It differs from cteruleo-mactdatus (C. et V. xi.
p. 12S) and its allies in not having a thick upper lip. The height of the body is to the whole

length of the fish as  I to 5^ ;  the thickness, which  is  greatest  at  the  gill-plates,  as  1  to  7'8                and
                                                                                                                        ;

the length of the head as 1 to 46. In profile the fish closely resembles M. parsia of Bu-

chanan Hamilton (pi. 17. f. 21), and the curve is regular from the dorsal to the nostrils.

When viewed from above, however, there appears a greater narrowness of the snout, which,

though obtuse, has not more than half the width at the nostrils that it has at the gill-plates.
The head is also much and evenly rounded off laterally, being in nowise flattened. It differs

further from parsia in the maxillary being entirely concealed. The cleft of the shut mouth
is bent en chevron, the angle being at the symphysis. An adipose substance, such as exists at

certain seasons in the Mackerel, invests the temples and front of the eye, partially covering

the preorbitar and leaving a vertically elliptical part of the eye visible. Thirty-one scales
form a row between the gill-opening and caudal, and there are ten rows in the height of the
body. Each scale has from seven to twelve basal furrows with a corresponding number of

crenatures, a small central tube with a fine line running back from it and branching off to the

various furrows, and on the posterior or free border there are thirty or forty fine lines com-
mencing near the tube and becoming fissures on the extreme edge, producing so many flat and
extremely thin teeth set like those of a fine comb. The central tubes, when the scales are in

situ, produce, in conjunction with the basal furrows which shine through, the appearance of as
many lateral lines as there are rows of scales, causing the marks on each scale to appear com-

pound, though they are really simple. On the head there are several scales which have each

two or three contiguous deeply impressed furrows on their discs ; these produce one row on
each temple, and another on each side more interiorly, which are connected by a transverse
row on the nape, and also by a cross row at the orbits. The anal commences a little before
the dorsal, and also ends sooner, though it is a little larger. The difference of origin is not
so great as in M. parsia. Neither of the fins are large, and they are both scaly. The first
anal spine is so minute that it can be detected only by dissection. The fourth spine of the first
dorsal is short and slender. There are pointed scaly processes over the pectorals and ven-
tral:, and one between the latter fins. No peculiar markings remain on the specimen, which,

except that the tips of the pectorals are broken, is in excellent condition. The scales are
bright, and the whole fore-part back to the anus is dark bronze-coloured, more as if the fish
had been stained by others in the same jar than like an original marking. There is no spot
on the base of the pectoral. Length 7 inches; from snout to anus, 3'8 inches; to dorsal

2-85 inches; to termination of scales on the tail, 5-75 inches. Length of head, r35 inch.
Height of body, 1-5 inch. Thickness at gill-plates, 0"90 inch.

   This Mullet, which is known to us only by the figure, is remarkable for its slender-pointed
250 REPORT--1845.

head, the prominent curve of its belly, and the thickness of the trunk of its tail. The under-
lip is shown as shutting in under the snout, and the form of the preorbitar is not so di-
stinctly defined as to enable us to place the species in its proper group. The height of the
body is contained three times and a half in the total length, caudal included. The back is
little elevated but is angular in profile, which rises in a gentle and slightly concave slope
from the point of the snout to the first dorsal. From thence to the second dorsal the line is
horizontal ; and the rest of the upper profile to the base of the caudal is slightly concave.
The under curve is boldly convex to the anus, from whence to the caudal the ascent is con-
siderable and the curve concave. The second dorsal commences one- third of the length be-
hind the beginning of the anal, and extends as far beyond it. The space between the anal
and caudal exceeds the length of the anal. The caudal is acutely but not deeply notched.

   On the back and upper part of the sides the discs of the scales are pale grass-green, their
margins silvery, and the whole lower parts are pearly and silvery. The tubes of the scales
are strongly marked down to the middle of the sides, producing rows. The mouth is hya-
cinth-red, the fore part of the gill-cover is bufF-orange, and there is a patch of bright Berlin-
blue at the upper angle of the gill-opening. The pectoral is dark brownish olive-green ; the
first dorsal red lilac-purple; the second dorsal and caudal mountain-green, the notch of the
latter being edged with plum-purple ; the membrane of the anal is pale mountain-green, its
rays and a streak at its base being white. The I'ays of the ventrals are also opake, white, with
some carmine streaks on their tips, and the membrane is pale blue.

   The anonymous author of the book quoted above has given a pen-and-ink sketch of a
small iish taken by him in the ditches and stagnant pools of Danes Island in the river at
Canton, and nanaed by him Labrus paludosus. Broussonnet has referred it to the L, opercu-
laris of Linnoeus, but we think erroneously, as the numbers of the rays do not agree, the spines
of the dorsal in particular differing widely. It seems to be either a Polyacanthus or Macro-
podus, and it differs from the desci-ibed species of the latter in its cuneate tail and in the tips
of the other two vertical fins being less elongated. Its form is oblong'linear; the height
being contained five or six times in the total length ; the head obtuse in profile, and the
mouth at mid-height and terminal. The body tapers slightly to the semi-oval end of the
tail, which is embraced by the pointed caudal. Body compressed and scaly, the back narrow.
The second ray of the ventrals is stated to be very long by the author, but his figure repre-
sents it as not reaching beyond the anterior third of the anal. The colour is olive-green with
ten transverse yellow bars, and there is a dark mark on the upper part of the gill-cover near

its edge.

   This fish is described as having its body extended nearly in form of a parallelogram with
the soft rays of the dorsal and anal longer than the spines, and the ventrals with a thread-like
point. The body is shining with more than ten cross brown bars, the head spotted above,
and the tip of the gill-cover marked by a dark brown spot.

Teeth short and densely villiform, or rather finely card-like, vpith a cluster of longer ones at

Athe symphysis, as in the Serrani. portion of the dental surface projects forward at the apex

of the lower jaw, and the teeth of the exterior row there and at the sides of the jaw are stronger
than the rest. The palatine bones are armed with stronger curved teeth, having smaller ones
at their bases. Vomerine teeth small. Pharyngeal apparatus an oval cell capable of being
closed by various lobes which spring from its borders. Scales ciliated, and strongly marked
by curved streaks nearly parallel to their posterior edges. Lateral line interrupted over the
anus, and commencing again on the second row of scales beneath, whence it runs straight to the
end of the tail. Ground colour yellowish-broWn, fading to broccoli-brown and bluish-gray on
the belly. Large irregular blackish-brown spots in two or three rows on the sides, and ten
or eleven round spots along the base of the dorsal, which becomes dark towards the edge, and
in the figure shows obscurely three other rows of dark spots ; these are effaced in the speci-
mens. The anal also is dark on its outer half, and shows faintly a series of oblique bars.
One blackish-broWn stripe passes backwards from the eye along the temporal groove, and
dilates on the Side of the head and upper edge of the gill-cover ; another crosses the cheek
lower down, and passing over the lower border of the operculum, is continued to the base of
the pectoral ; the space between these is nearly filled by a paler umber-brown bar, which is
bordered by the yellowish-broWn ground colour. There are also blackish-brown spots and
bars scattered over the nose, top of the head and jaws ; and three imperfect bars on the pec-
torals. The caudal in fig. 148 is uniformly dark, with two transverse bars on its scaly base.
In figure /3. 19 the basal half of the caudal is straw-yellow, with four dark transverse bars, and
the other vertical fins are also lighter with more definite bars. Length of specimen 5-j inches;
length from snout to anuS, 2"45 inches; length of head, 1'6 inch; height of body, 0'9 inch.

    There is a difference in the numbers of the fin-rays in Mr. ReeVes's two figures.
   The above description is drawn up of two specimens in the museum of the Cambridge Phi-
losophical Institution, which were brought from Canton by the Rev. George Vachell. In the
same institution are two rather larger specimens from the same quarter which do not differ in
any essential point of structure, but present a series of bright silvery rhomboidal marks be-
tween the two principal rows of dark lateral spots, having, with them, a quincuncial arrange-
ment. These bright places are not shown in either of Mr. Reeves's figures. There are series
of pores in the temporal fossae down the limb of the preoperculum and along the limbs of the
lower jaw. The lateral line is interrupted over the anus, but there are as many rows of lines
as there are scales, so that the proper continuation of the line is difScult to make out. Length
of specimens 6^ and 8^ inches ; rays of dorsal, 44 ; of anal, 1(28.
    These Ophicephali are carried about the streets of Canton in tubs and are cut in pieces alive

for sale.

    As most of the Chinese Ophicephali have been described from drawings only, and the colours
appear to vary with age and season, it is probable that there has been an undue multiplication
of species ; and the drawing now quoted may eventually prove to be referrible to the same
species with Lacepfede's oculatus, but his figure differs in form, and it is impossible to reconcile
the two in the present state of our knowledge of the ichthyology of Canton.

    Mr. Reeves's drawing o( puticola presents a light oil-green colour along the back, gradually
passing on the sides and belly into peach-blossom red ; a pale apple-green bar deeper towards
its edges covers the temples and operculum ; and there are about eleven blackish-green bars
on the sides, bent backwards eti chevron in the middle, and fading away towards the belly.

On the scaly base of the tail, above its middle, there is a round spot of the same blackish-green
hue. The head behind the eyes, the whole of the sides, the lower half of the dorsal, and the

basal half of the caudal, are thickly spotted with points and small lines of sienna-yellow. All
 the fins are broadly bordered with blackish-gray, the basal halves of the anal and dorsal being
ochraceous, and of the pectorals and caudal approaching to hyacinth-red. The tubular mar-
gins of the anterior nasal openings are represented as unusually long: the caudal as much
rounded, and the length as equal to six times and one-half the height of the body. D. 43;

     As the young of Oph. marulius differs very greatly from the adult in its colours, so it is not
 impossible but this may be the young of the preceding. Its different Chinese designation,
 however, and very different tints of colour, induce us to name it as distinct.

     The body is marked by ten or eleven blackish-green waved and forked bands, alternating
 with as many arterial blood- red ones; the two colours being about equal in quantity, either
 may be considered as the ground one. The top of the head is dark green ; a dark green
 stripe which runs backwards from the eye and spreads over the gill-cover, is traversed part
 of the way by two red bars ; and there is a red spot near the tip of the gill-flap. Some yel-
 low points are scattered on the side of the head and along the flanks, but not nearly so copi-
 ously as in puticola. The caudal, dorsal and pectorals are broccoli-brown, without bars or spots.
  The anal is yellowish-brown at the base, marked along its middle by a narrow white riband,
  which is shaded above by blackish-gray passing into white, and finally, the edge of the fin is
  bluish-gray. The anterior nostrils are tubular, but the tubes are scarcely so long as those of
 puticola. The form of the fish otherwise is much the same as in that species. Length of

  figure nearly 6 inches.

distinguished from the preceding only by the teeth, which are those of a Dascyllus, and are
villiform, with the front row stronger. It has not the aspect of a Dascyllus, nor the serrated
preoperculum. It is not easy to say which of Mr. Reeves's drawings, n. 31 or 256, repre-
sents this fish best, but on the whole we have thought proper to refer to the former, which
indicates the bhie borders of the caudal more distinctly. The two figures are illuminated
much alike, viz. with fine vertical blue or black bands, and intermediate spaces on the back
of bright gamboge yellow. In a. 31 the yellow colour spi'eads over the dorsal to near its
edge, while in 256 the fin is uniformly dark blue, the scaly sheath at its base being yellow;
a. 31 has also a crimson-red head and a streak of carmine round the base of the pectoral.
 Length of figure 6 inches.

    The prevailing colour in Mr. Reeves's drawing is pale mountain-green, without any of the
yellow of the preceding two species. The cheeks and gill-covers are crimson. The fins are
greenish, but darken greatly towards their borders. The species has been determined solely
from the drawing, and is doubtful. In the ' Histoire des Poissons,' Bennet's figure of Chce-
todon tyrwhitti is referred to rahti, but as it is illuminated in accordance with Reeves's figure
a. 31, I have considered it to be a representation of the specimen described in the preceding

article.

  We have not seen a specimen to which we could refer Mr. Reeves's drawing 274 (Hardw.

145), and are unable to determine the genus to which it belongs. It has the aspect of Gly-
phisodon, a large eye, narrow preorbitar, oblong-oval form, the height of the body being equal
to half the distance between the snout and the base of the caudal fin. The rays are D. 13111
or 12 ; A. 2|10, &c.; the second anal spine is stouter than usual, the caudal much forked with
pointed lobes, and there is a filiform tip to the ventrals. The general tint is dark greenish-
blue without bars, the head glossed with crimson, the fins blackish-brown, and a black mark
on the base of the pectoral. The drawing, like the rest, was executed at Canton. It measures
5 inches.

   The only example we have seen of this species was sent to Haslar Museum from Hong
Kong, by Surgeon R. A. Bankier, R.N. It has the oblong form of a Pomacentrus, the height
of the body being contained thrice and a half in the total length, caudal included. The teeth
stand in a single row and are chisel-shaped, with truncated entire tips. The eye is large

preoperculum uneven, but not regularly toothed ; and the operculum terminating in a flat acute
pungent point, with a shallow sinus above it ending in a sharp corner: a longitudinal row of
scales between the gill-opening and caudal contains twenty-six. The lateral line terminates
at the base of the last dorsal ray, and is continued lower down by a little pore in the disc of
each scale. The vertical fins are scaly as usual. The middle soft rays of the dorsal end in a short
filiform tip, and there is a corresponding acuniination of the anal, hut not so well marked. The
caudal is slightly forked with acute tips. The species differs from the members of the group
headed in the ' Ilistoire des Poissons' by axtireiis, in the pointed lobes of tlie caudal. It has
lost much of its colour, and shows no traces of the dark eye-like spots which characterize the
majority of the group. The caudal, end of the tail and hinder parts of the dorsal and anal
retain a tinge of yellow; the rest of the two latter fins appears to have been fringed with

black, and the fore-part generally of the fish looks dark. Length 2J inches.

The profile of this species, leaving out part of the tail, is nearly orbicular, and the body is

greatly compressed. Teeth in one row short, subulate, acute, with very minute ones behind,

scarcely perceptible even through a lens. Narrow preorbitar scaly, and when examined by

a lens, seen to be minutely toothed ; as is also the vertical limb of the preoperculum, a few

teeth at the corner of this bone being larger. A slight sinus in the operculum. Twenty-five

scales in a row between gill-cover and anus, and tpn or eleven in a vertical row, the lateral

line being traced on the second row from the base of the dorsal. It is at first marked by a

single pore on the disc of each scale, and further on by a series of short tubes which terminate

at the end of the dorsal. Most of the posterior scales have a little pit on their discs, producing

were brought from China by Sir Edward Belcher. The tips of the soft rays of their vertical

fins are a little shortened, but the caudal is sufficiently perfect to show that it was slightly

notched at the end. After long maceration in spirits, the ground colour is milk-white, with

a well-defined pale yellowish-brown border to each scale, producing a net-work with acutely
elliptical meshes. The spinous dorsal and the ventrals are clouded with umber-brown. The

other fins retain no colour. Length g-j inches.

   It has been remarked in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' that the differently coloured Amphi-
prions may be in many instances mere varieties of one species. As these have however been
described and named, it seems necessary that this one, whether species or variety, should also

be noted.
   The general colour appears nearly uniform, but is composed of black with orange-brown

and crimson, the latter colour replacing the others before the nose. The breast, pectorals and
ventrals are bright saffron- or kiiig's-yellow ; a white band descends from the nape over the
fore part of gill-cover and edge of preoperculum, another from the posterior dorsal spines to
the anal region, and a third occupies the trunk of the tail between the vertical fins. These
three bands have a faint flesh-coloured or roseate tinge, and the first two are edged with ver-
digris-green. The caudal is cream-yellow without shadings or spots. The lobes of the caudal
are obtuse. Length 4-^ inches.

   The Haslar Museum possesses specimens of this fish, presented to it by Capt. Dawkins, R.N.,
who brought them from China. In one individual the ventrals are wholly orange-coloured,
in another they are edged like the anal with black, as described by the authors of the ' Fauna
Japonica.' It is probable that both tl)is fish and the one preceding it will eventually prove to
be mere varieties of chrysopterus. In japonicus the stomach is nearly globular with three

conical pyloric caeca, and the eggs are oblong-oval, and not round.

This fish agrees with L. pcecilopleura and gayi in the number of the rays and in many

other characters, but differs from both as much as they do from one another.

    Teeth labroid, curved, acute and conical, diminishing as they recede from the symphysis

Abut a large curved canine tooth stands forwards from the angle of the mouth. row of small

interior teeth runs as far back as the middle of the upper jaw, but in the lower jaw it is con-
fined to the front part. Five rows of small tiled scales cover the cheek up to the suborbitar
chain. None exist on the disc of the preoperculum, nor on the dilated interoperculum which

spreads under the throat. Large irregular scales cover the operculum. Lateral line traced
on twenty-six or twenty-seven scales by bushy muciferous canals. Each cluster is formed of

obtuse bifurcations thrice repeated, but the forks are less numerous near the bend of the line
at the end of the dorsal, and almost disappear in the short space behind it. The very even

dorsal and anal fins move in furrows formed by scaly fillets, and there is a filament behind

the tip of each dorsal spine. The drawing is coloured aurora-red, passing into hyacinth-red

on the back, with a darker meniscoid patch on the edge of each scale, and ten green lines ra-

diating from the eye forwards, across the top of the head and backwards over the nape, but
not on the cheek. There is also a yellowish tinge on the snouc. The vertical fins are coloured
like the body, but the dorsal and base of the caudal are glossed with yellow and green, and
the dorsal is marked by three rows of small olive-green spots. The ventrals are peach-blos-

som red, and the pectorals transparent, with a blile edge to their scaly base. Length of the

specimen 9-J inches; of the drawing, 7 inches.

Our knowledge of this species is derived from one of Biirger's Japanese speciiriens belQng.i

ing to the British Museum. It has the general form of L. eothinus, but is rather niore slender,

and is further distinguished from that species by a purple spot at the base of the fifth dorsal

spine, some white spots on the back and four brown longitudinal lines. There are twenty-

live scales on the lateral line, and the muciferous canals on each are twice forked on the an-

terior part of the body, and more simple posteriorly, being no where bushy. The number of

the ' Fauna Japonica' which is to contain the descriptions of the Labridce is npt yet published

(March 1, 1846), and we do not therefore know whether the authors of the work in their

selection of the specific epithet had reference to the Sparus rubiginosus of Solsnder, which is

either a Lahrus or lulls. This however has a lunate caudal with acute angles, wh'Ie the Japa-

nese fish has a rounded or nearly square caudal (vide Iiilis ? rubiginosus, Richardson, 'Ann.

and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' for June 1843).

  A dried specimen of this fish, brought from Canton by John Reeves, Esq., exists in the
British Museum, measuring fourteen inches in length. The drawing is eleven inches long.
In the number of the rays and many other characters it agrees with C. schoenleinii, but it has

not the vertical profile of that species. In the rays, and also in the form and distribution of
the markings, it is much like the Labrus japonicus as figured in the ' Fauna Japonica,' pi. 85,
but has a much less convex and more sloping profile as well as a different ground colour. The
latter difference would weigh little as a specific distinction, since the reds, greens and blues of

the Labridee are interchangeable at various seasons and after the death of the fish ; but there
is also a discrepancy in the ramifications of the mucous canals which form the lateral line.

They are less branched anteriorly in L. japonicus, but in C. cyanostolus, as in schoenleinii, they

become more simple posteriorly.

Height of body contained twice and two-thirds in the whole length. Profile between the

Aupper lip and dorsal a small arc of a circle, slightly gibbous at the eye.  long scaly

trunk of the tail, the scales covering much of the caudal fin, which consequently looks short

Aand spreads little.  stout subulato-conical tooth next the symphysis is followed by a shorter

one. The jaw behind them swells out into a thickish roll, in which a short conical tooth is

implanted immediately behind the front canine ; further along the jaw there are some scarcely

perceptible granular teeth. In the lower jaw the second tooth is slightly recurved, and there

is no toothlet in the bony roll behind the front canine, but some very minute granular teeth

exist on the edge of the jaw, and at the angle of the mouth four contiguous teeth rise above

the rest ; but even these are small and might be easily overlooked in a recent specimen. Lips

large. Top of the head, large preorbitar, margin of the orbit, lower jaw, most of the inter-

opercular plate, and the disc of the preoperculum minutely porous. Five rows of small, round,

distant scales imbedded in the cheek, thinning off to one row on the temples. Upper limb of

preoperculum finely serrated by teeth which point upwards, the corner slightly rounded, and

the lower limb half as long as the upper one. Interoperculum spreading out into a large sub-

membranaceous flap which comes over the throat. In the specimen there are only four or five

scales remaining on this bone, and they are closely tiled at the angle of the preoperculum.

Four or five rows of larger scales exist on the operculum. The gill-flap ends in a rounded

membranous lobe which projects over the base of the pectoral. Lateral line composed of thirty

scales, and marked on each scale by a bush-like cluster of mucous canals, which are equally

full of branches from the beginning to the end of the line. Each cluster is bifurcated,

spreading equally above and below the line, and each fork consists of about four undulating

branches with short lateral branchlets. The basal striae show faintly through the scale

Awhich overlaps them.  patch of scales covers the supra- scapular, as in a sparoid.

The ground colour of the drawing is oil-green, darker on the head and back, and each scale

on the body and hinder part of the gill-cover is marked by an oval indigo -blue spot placed
vertically, and shaded off for the most part by greenish-blue. There are no spots beneath and

before the pectoral, and on the tail behind the anal and dorsal the spots are placed lengthwise,
so as to form longitudinal rows, which end in nearly continuous stre..ks on the caudal. They

are broken again into spots on the extremity of the caudal, and some of the streaks are glossed
with green. Three blue and green stripes radiate from the eye over the nose, and as many

Abackwards over the temples.  blue stripe edged with hyacinth-red borders the lips and

passes from the angle of the mouth over the lower limb of the preoperculum and subopercu-

lum. The membrane of the dorsal is hyacinth-red, the rays blue ; a series of blue and green

blotches mark the membrane between the spines at the points of the large scales, which form

a furrow for the fin, and there is a series of small blue points along the base of this scaly fur-

row. The anal is lemon-yellow inth an indigo-blue border, and streaks of the same, which

meander over the fin and anastomose. The pectorals are purplish with an aurora-red scaly
base bordered with blue. The rays of the ventrals are indigo-blue, and the membrane of the

caudal crimson and brown.
   The description of form is wholly from the dried specimen. Two smaller examples in spirits

from China are also deposited in the British Museum. In these there are two acute teeth in

the bony swelling behind the front canine, but no visible granular ones. There is however a

small canine at the angle of the mouth. In the lower jaw the interior bony roll is flattish near

the symphysis, and the posterior two-thirds of its length is occupied by short, conical and

rather acute teeth. Two rows of scales cover two-thirds of the interoperculum ; there are

three or four rows of large opercular scales, and the scaly fillets at the base of the anal and

dorsal are very distinct. The specimens are 11 inches long.

The British Museum possesses a mounted specimen of this fish, which was brought from

Canton by John Reeves, Esq. It is nearly allied by form and colour to C. cyanostolus, schoen-

leinii and Lahrus japonicus, all of which agree closely in the numbers of the fin-rays, but it

is readily distinguished by an eyed spot in the soft dorsal. Profile much like that of C. cya-

nostolus, with a more gibbous nape, and the eye closer to the frontal line. The small scales

on the top of the head terminate between the orbits by a deeply concave line. The snout,

nasal region, jaws, throat, fore part of cheek and disc of preoperculum are naked. Five rows of

small scales occupy a space in the curve of the preoperculum, equal in breadth to that of the

porous skin betwixt them and the eye. Upper limb of the preoperculum finely and equally

serrated; under edge roughish, but not distinctly crenated ; its corner slightly rounded. Five

or six horizontal rows of scales on the gill-cover, which ends in a roundish flap, that is nar-

Arowed, as in the preceding species, by a curve cutting into the suboperculum. strong coni-

cal tooth next the symphysis of the upper jaw inclines to the mesial line and rests against its

fellow in the other intermaxillary; a small tooth immediately follows it, and in the middle of

the gape there is another, but none at the corner of the mouth, and no other teeth, although

some faint crenatures may be detected on the edge of the jaw. In the lower jaw the front

tooth on each limb is almost horizontal ; a smaller one succeeds, as in the upper jaw, but

the tooth in the middle of the limb is wanting ; there is a single row of minute rounded

teeth on the rather acute edge of the jaw, two or three of them next the corner of the mouth,

Arising above the others.  small bony roll or ridge swells up behind the front teeth of the

lower jaw, but the limbs of the jaw are rather thin. About twenty-eight scales enter into a

row between the gill-opening and caudal, and the radiating lines appear more distinctly than

in cyanostolus. The lateral line is formed by a short stem on each scale with short curved

branchlets directed upwards and downwards, the branchlets becoming inconspicuous under

the last five dorsal rays, and more posteriorly. This answers to the description of the lateral

line in C. schoenleinii, but the specimen has not the low dorsal of that species, nor the vertical

forehead. The tips of the membrane overtop the spines of the dorsal.

The ground colour of the drawing is apple-green deepening to blackish-green on the back,

and passing into oil-green and wax-yellow towards the belly. The pectorals and most of the

caudal have the middle tint of the sides, and the head is mostly oil-green with much lustre.

Each scale down to the lower edge of the pectoral has an oval mark on its disc, which ante-

riorly is ultramarine-blue, and posteriorly verdigris-green. The bases of the caudal rays are

also green, and the upper corner of the fin is orpiment-orange, edged with blue, while the

lower corner is wholly purple. The anal has a blue stripe at its base, two rows of blue spots

on its disc, and a purple edge. The dorsal is yellowish-brown with the tips of membrane be-

hind the spines, and a row of patches along the middle of the fin blue. The edge of the soft

part of the fin is orange, and there is a blackish-blue spot, surrounded by a paler ring, on the

bases of the first two jointed rays. The rays of the ventrals are blue, and the scaly base of

the pectorals is Dutch-orange, finely dotted with brown and edged with blue. The lips are

blue ; a blue stripe runs back from the angle of the mouth to the preoperculum ; and a blue

Streak surrounds the gill-cover some way from its border. The eye is encircled by a blue

  A mounted specimen of this fish from Canton was presented to the British Museum by John

Reeves, Esq. In the structure of the gill-pieces, the numbers of the fin-rays and other cha-
racters, this and the preceding species, and also Ctenolabrus flagellifer, have much resemblance
to Labnts jnponicus and Cossypkus schoenleinii, cyanostolus and ommopterus. Their distribu-
tion into different genera seems to be artificial.

   The colours and markings of the Chinese fish agree in the main with individuals taken in
the Red sea, but as there is some difference, it may be proper to describe Mr. Reeves's draw-
ing. The ground colour is dark duck-green, deepening to blackish-green on the summit of
the back, and fading away on the ventral line. The rays of all the fins have the same green
colour. Each scale is marked by a clear round white spot, shaded with sky-blue. In the de-
scriptions of the Red sea fish these spots are said to be confined to the lower parts of the sides.

A pale red-lilac streak runs from the corner of the mouth to the preoperculum. The suboper-

culura is edged by a line of the same colour, and several traverse its disc and anastomose with

one another. A small China-blue bar, bent en chevron, is placed on the tip of the gill-cover. Eye
reddish-orange. The membranes of the dorsal and caudal are hyacinth-red, and the lower
half of the former is marked by three rows of white spots. The basal half of the anal is white
with oblique bars of hyacinth-red, its outer border is reddish-lilac. The pectorals are olive-

green and the ventrals blue.

several exist in the British Museum and Cambridge Philosophical Institution, which were

brought from Canton by John Reeves, Esq. and the Rev. George Vachell ; and there are also

three in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park. Height of body and length of head equal to

one another, and to one-fourth of the total length : the thickness contained twice and one-

half in the height. Caudal rounded. About twenty-six scales in the lateral line, which is

bent suddenly down near the end of the dorsal by a short oblique elbow. Each scale of the

line is marked obscurely by three short tubes, diverging from the point of a very short stem.

Scales truncated at the base, elliptical at the posterior or free end, with about twenty to
twenty-six fine furrows on each end diverging in a fan-like manner from near the centre, a
triangular space on each side showing only the parallel lines of structure. Teeth rather
bluntish ; a sharp curved canine standing forwards from each side of upper jaw near the angle
of the mouth. Jaws with considerable protractility.

    In Mr. Reeves's drawing the ground colour of the body is pistachio-green, the breast and
belly being paler. About eight or nine irregular bars, formed by the dark borders of the

scales, descend from the back past the middle. The vertical fins are vermilion-red, vfith
four rows of round and oval straw-yellow spots occupying more space than the red, which
however forms a border to the dorsal and anal. In the specimens only two rows of these yel-
low spots remain on the dorsal, the outer half of the fins being red with a very slight mottling
but there is a dark spot on the dorsal, between the fifth and seventh spines, which is not
shown in the figure. The corners of the caudal, both in the figure and specimens, are yellow,
and in the figure there are various orange-coloured spots and bars on the head shaded with
blue. The form of these can be traced on the specimens though the colour is gone. The
dorsal spines have filamentous tips, and are shorter than the soft rays. Length of specimens
and figure 5^ and 6 inches. The anal spines vary from one to three, there being one or two
additional jointed rays when the spines are deficient.

    Notwithstanding that this drawing and the following differ somewhat in form and in the
numbers of the spinous rays from the preceding one as well as in colours, I have a strong
suspicion that they are all three representations of the same species in different conditions.
The yellow corners of the caudal are common to them all. The marks on the head and on
the dorsal are also on the same plan, and on comparing the numerous specimens of exornatus
which we have seen, most of them appear intermediate in their markings between Mr. Reeves's
drawings |3. 10 and 258.

    In 258 the green colour of the body is varied by an elliptical orange-brown spot, placed
vertically on each scale. There are three indistinct golden spots under the spinous rays and
fore-half of the soft dorsal, and four yellow patches on the middle height of the tail posterior to
the anus, which shade off into the green. The bars on the head are orange-brown, instead
of orpiment-orange. The two basal rows of spots on the dorsal and anal are dull, and of a
wax-yellow or olive-green colour, and the ground colour of these with their outer halves and
the middle part of the caudal are cochineal-red or dark crimson. The corners of the caudal
are bright yellow. The base of the pectoral is red, and there is a bluish shade on the supra-
axillary plate of the coracoid bone. Some blue marks exist also on the upper half of the
spinous dorsal, most crowded between the fifth and seventh spines, where the dark mark of
exornatus is placed. Length of figure nearly 7 inches.

   In this figure the head is marked and coloured like the preceding one, but the sides-are
chequered by square golden spots which alternate with similar spaces of the ground colour.
This is green, like the preceding varieties, on the head, along the back, and in the middle
over the anus ; but in the humeral region and on the tail it passes into indigo-blue. The
belly is white, the white passing along above the base of the anal ; while in the preceding
figures, the ground colour, though paler, goes to the base of the fin. The dorsal is coloured
not much unlike that of the preceding, but the orange-brown ground colour fades to hair-
brown on the outer half, and the spots at the base of the fin are orange, shaded with pale
yellow. The anal is pale green on the basal half, and purple exteriorly, with a darker green
stripe where the colours meet. The corners of the caudal are bright yellow, the middle part
dark grayish-blue, with indigo-blue spots on the base. The scaly base of the pectoral red, as
in the preceding. In some respects this figure resembles the Julis decussatus (Benn. Ceylon,

   A dried specimen of this fish exists in the British Museum, which was brought from Can-

ton by John Reeves, Esq. The height of the body is somewhat less than the length of the
head, and equals one-fourth of the whole length of the fish. The upper jaw has five conico-
subulate teeth of the usual form, with small rounded interior ones, and these come forward to
the edge of the jaw behind the last subulate tooth in two or three rows, like the minute mo-
lars of a sparoid. On the lower jaw there are thirteen exterior teeth on each limb, and the
interior granular teeth do not run so far back. Gill-flap tapering, but rounded at the tip.
Lateral line composed of twenty-nine scales, slightly arched at its commencement, then con-
tinuing horizontal as far as the ninth soft ray of the dorsal, when it is bent down over three
scales and continued straight again to the caudal. It is marked on each scale by a gently
waved and slightly rising tube, which before the bend of the line is simple and more poste-
riorly emits one or two branchlets. The ground colour is pistachio-green, darker on the bases
of the scales, and fading to asparagus-green on the lower parts of the sides. The nape is
brownish-red, and two stripes of that colour traverse the fish, the narrower one keeping along
the summit of the back and the broader one along the middle of the side. On this stripe above
the pectoral there is a dark blackish-blue spot. There are many rows of small, round reddish-
orange spots, nearly as numerous as the scales, and becoming dark orange-brown in the
stripes. These spots extend to the caudal, which is deep sulphur-yellow. The head is marked
by golden stripes bordered by blue. The dorsal and anal are pale crimson with a greenish
tint on the soft rays, and are thickly sprinkled with carmine spots. The pectorals and ven-
trals are almost colourless, but the scaly base of the former is yellow and purple bounded by
a red streak. The lateral stripe is almost black in the dried specimen. Length of specimen
8^ inches, of head 2 inches.

This species wants the brown longitudinal stripes of the preceding, but has otherwise con-

siderable similarity in its tints of colour and markings. If the humped-back be not an acci-

dental individual deformity, the fish is at once distinguished by it from other species. The

ground colour of the head is duck-green, dark on the back, paler on the sides, and mixed with

oil-green and yellow ; the under surface is pale blue. There is a darker meniscoid spot on each

Ascale, which on the shoulder and pectoral region is orange-red.  large dark blue mark over

the pectoral has the spots on the scales almost black. The lines and spots on the head are

vermilion with blue edges. The fins are pale Berlin-blue and are covered with tile-red

spots, which form transverse bars on the caudal, and the dorsal and anal have a submarginal

red stripe. The base of the pectoral is blue with a red streak ; its membrane and that of the
ventrals are spotless. The back of this fish rises into a bold hump under the spinous dorsal,

the lateral line partaking of the curvature. Length of the figure 7 inches.

   This drawing represents a fish having a profile more vertical than that of the European
cultratus and much like that of Ruppell's bimaculaia, but with a proportionally higher body,
a taller first dorsal ray, larger filiform tip to the ventrals, apparently no scales on the cheek,
a much less rounded caudal, larger front teeth, and a lateral spot placed nearly, like that of
pavo, on the seventh or eighth scale of the lateral line and rising above it. As near as one can
judge from description alone, its form seems to be like that of X. cyanifrons of the ' Histoire
des Poissons,' but its colours do not correspond and its black lateral mark distinguishes it.

   The colours of the upper and lower part of the sides and the disc of the caudal fin are
bright carmine, the middle of the flanks from the pectoral to the hinder part of the anal being
pale buff orange, as are also the membranes of the dorsal and anal. The top of the head and
back above the lateral line which terminates at the base of the last dorsal ray are lavender-
purple ; the trunk of the tail, which is bisected by the short second portion of the lateral
line, being wholly carmine. Each scale throughout the body has a deeper coloured meniscoid
segment on its edge, but of the same tint with its much paler disc. The cheeks are carmine
with red-lilac-purple gill-pieces, throat and breast. The profile of the head, from the nape
to the dorsal, is edged with a blue and green stripe, and there are six or seven wavy crimson
streaks on the temples, and a few faint longitudinal ones on the operculum. Two rows of
blue dots run along the summit of the back, and three rows along the belly, beginning at the
ventrals and thinning off at the end of the anal. An oval black mark without a pale border
is placed on the lateral line at the seventh scale, most of the spots being above the line. The
anterior dorsal ray, which is nearly equal in height to the nape and twice as tall as the
other rays, is blue, and three blue lines, more or less interrupted, run along the fin, which is
shaded on the edge with lake-red. The anal has a blue line along its base, and its rays are
blue with red tips. The upper and under edges of the caudal are buff orange, and its pos-
terior rounded edge pale or whitish. Ventrals lemon-yellow with purple rays, and the pec-
torals purple at the base, shaded at the top into blackish-gray. Length of drawing 7J inches.

    This species seems to be nearly allied in form and in being banded vertically to the Ch.
quinquecinctus of Riippell, but the caudal is much less notched between the points of the
rays, the anal is rounded at the top and not so long, the profile of the forehead more even
and sloping, the snout more slender, and the pale and vertical bands differently placed. It
agrees with quinquecinctus in having two rows of scales on the cheek, and in the bases of the
vertical fins being sheathed by large scales like a Cossyphus. It differs from Ch. fasciatus,
Bl. 257, in having a truncated and slightly rounded caudal, as well as in the profile and dis-
position of the dark bands.

    The muzzle is slender, the profile of the face straight and sloping, nearly touching the eye,
and the nape very slightly arched. The height of the body is contained three times and a
half in the total length, caudal included. Of this length the head forms rather less than
one-third. The dorsal is rather less rounded at the tip than the anal, and they are nearly of
equal length, neither of them passing the base of the caudal. The rays of the caudal are
forked at the tips, and scarcely project beyond the membrane. The ventrals are attached
under the axilla of the pectorals, being somewhat further back than in Ch. quinquecinctus, as
represented by Riippell. The two anterior teeth of each jaw are so much larger than the
others as to appear like canines, and behind the upper ones are three or four bluntish teeth.
On the limbs of both jaws the teeth are in a single series, diminishing slightly as they approach
--262 REPORT 1843.

the angle of the mouth. The jaw is not swelled as in Cossyphus, but except in that respect
and the interrupted lateral line, this fish agrees closely with that genus. The scales are large,
there being only about twenty in a longitudinal row behind the gill-opening. The upper
part of the lateral line is traced on thirteen scales and the lower one on eight, the parts over-
lapping each other a little. The tubes of the scales are sparingly furnished with lateral
branches which are mostly short and basal. On some scales near the tail they are quite

simple.

    The prevailing tint of the specimens, which have been for two years in spirits, is a rich pur-
plish brown, with lighter parts forming indistinctly about six bars, the first of which descends
&om the suboperculum over the breast, the second is behind the pectoral, and the last on the
base of the caudal. The dark parts are clouded and spotted, and run over the dorsal and
anal. They anastomose irregularly with one another, and are also varied by a narrow pale
vertical streak on each scale, ihe tip of the scale being dark. Similar streaks, inclined various
ways, exist on the scales of the operculum and temples, and on the cheek and interoperculum
they are contracted into a roundish spot in the centre of each scale. Three pale lines cross
each preorbitar, and one follows the curve of the orbit on the suborbitar, having underneath
it a row of pale pores with open mouths. The caudal is pale towards the base, dark and
mottled on the posterior, with the extreme tip paler again. The pectoral is pale without
markings, and there are dark blotches on the ventrals.

    Two specimens, about five inches long, exist in Sir Edward Belcher's collection, in which

they were associated with some Chinese fish, but the place of their capture was not noted.

    John Reeves, Esq. presented an example of this specimen from Canton to the British Mu-
 seum. It differs slightly, in the numbers of its rays, from the specimen of limbatus described

 in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' also from Canton, yet the distribution of the colours is so

 similar, that I have little hesitation in considering it to be of the same species. I am also of
 opinion that it is identical with Sc. ovifrons of the ' Fauna Japonica.' It has a gibbous snout,
 though not to the same degree as is exhibited in the figure of the species just named, but
 such gibbosities vary in many fish with age, and not unfrequently with the degree of fatness
 of the individual. There is some discrepancy as to colour, and on that account I have quoted
 the synonym with doubt, which may perhaps be cleaied away when the letter-press of this
 portion of the 'fauna Japonica' appears, and we learn whether the figure was illuminated from
 the recent fish or from one whose colours had partially changed. The Chinese name of the fish
 is the same as that of the Cossyphus cyanostolus. The jaws are greenish with a smooth sur-
 face, in which the form of the teeth is obscurely seen. The edges of the jaws are crenated,
 particularly posteriorly, where the edges are also undulated, but there is no canine tooth
 there. The scales have finely granulated discs, and the lateral line is formed of a series of

 tubes, each with a bushy tip, which is so obscure as scarcely to be distinguished from the granu-
 lations. Twenty-five scales compose the line, the last three lying on the caudal fin. Length
 of specimen 16J inches, of drawing 14 inches. In the drawing the general colour is blackish-
 green, slightly glossed with brown on the belly, the edges of the scales being dark chocolate.
 The dark green surrounds the eye, and glosses the lower part of the cheek and the inter-
 operculum ; the rest of the sides of the head, the breast and discs of all the fins are dark
 hyacinth-red, which in the anal is glossed with auricula-purple. The outer edges of all the fins,
 the corner of the mouth and the lower lip are indigo-blue. The edges of the lips are carmine.

 more. In form and distribution of colours the species closely resembles Scarus frenatus,
 Lacep., Sc. psittacus and Sc. harid, Riipp., Sc. liarid, C. et V. (which is different from that of
 Riippell), and Sc. dussumieri, and several others described in the ' Histoire des Poissons.' It
 cannot however be perfectly reconciled with the descriptions of any of them ; and unless
 several characters, which have been relied upon by ichthyologists for distinguishing species,
 should prove to be mere individual variations, it is a proper species ; but I expect when
 further comparisons have been instituted, that a number of nominal species, and this probably
 among the number, will be absorbed in the more ancient designations. In the ' Histoire des
 Poissons,' the name of Riippell's Scarus is changed from harid to ruppelii. another species or
 variety being described as the harid of Forskal ; but the dentition, as described by the latter
 author, agrees much better with Riippell's fish than with the harid of M. Valenciennes, which
 wants the canines at the angle of the mouth. Sc. pyrrostethus is much like Sc. pepo (Benn.
 Ceyl. 28. Maj. Neild's drawing in Hardw. Coll. Br. Mus. No. 313) in distribution of colours,

 but that fish has an uniformly arched profile.
    Scarus pyrrostethus has the profile of the face moderately concave before the eye, and the

acute points of the caudal projecting very little beyond the even or slightly rounded end of
the intermediate membrane. The white jaws are moderately convex and bulge less than
those of limbatus. About ten teeth may be counted on each side of the symphysis of each
jaw, and there is no canine at the angle of the mouth. The scales of the cheek approach
close to the orbit and permit less of the veined suborbitars to be seen than in limbatus. The
lateral line is traced on twenty-five scales by a tube on each, which emits a few simple
branches upwards and downwards, and has no bushy end. [The harid of the ' Histoire des
Poissons' is described as having a lateral line formed of a series of unbranched tubes.] The
discs of the scales are more finely granulated than in limbatus. The first anal spine is very
short, and the last soft ray is divided only at the tip, while the last ray of the dorsal is divided

to the base.

    Each scale on the body and tail, down to the level of the lower edge of the pectoral fin, has
an indigo-blue disc with a broad golden-coloured border edged with chestnut-brown. The
borders are wider on the back and the blue discs smaller, and the scaly sheath of the base of
the dorsal presents alternate, short, golden and blue vertical bars, the blue running into a
stripe of the same colour that runs along the bottom of the membrane. The rays of the fin
and its outer border are also blue, the membrane being reddish-orange. The anal has a
reddish-orange disc without the blue rays, but its outer edge and a line skirting its base are
blue. The same blue colour exists on the upper and under edge of the caudal and the first rays

Aof the pectoral and ventrals, but not on any other part of these fins. part of the pectoral next

the blue ray, three soft rays of the ventrals, and the under part of the fish below the level of
the pectorals, are reddish-orange. The disc of the caudal and upper parts of the head are
yellowish-brown. The eye and lips are oi'piment orange, and there is a blue bar behind each
lip ; another curves up from the angle of the mouth to the orbit to terminate there, and a
blue streak passes from the temples over the eye and across the forehead, to meet its fellow on

the other side.

   This drawing does not correspond with Russell's figure of the Wohla kuddera 175, nor with
the two Belones described by Riippell in the 'Neue Wirlbethiere,' nor with figures of any other
species that we have met with. The two jaws are equal, or very nearly so, and when mea-
sured to the front of the orbit, their length is contained four times and three-quarters in the
whole length of the fish. The anal is long, the dorsal moderately so, and commencing over
the second quarter of the anal, it seems to approach a little nearer to the caudal than that fin.
The caudal is slightly lunate at the end with the lower lobe rather the most prominent. The
back is green, the sides silvery with a purplish tint. Scales are distinctly represented in the
green upper part of the body, which is separated from the nacry sides by a lateral line, but
no inferior lateral line or keel is shown in the figure.

This species differs at first sight from H. longirostris (Cuv. et Russell, 178), and from H.

brevirostris (Idem et Russ. 177), in the relative size of the lower jaw, being less than that of

the one and longer than that of the other. From H. gamberur (Riipp. Neue Wirlb. 74 ; La-

cep. V. pi, 7. f. 2), it is distinguished by some differences in the numbers of the rays as well

                                                  have received specimens of intennedius

both from Chusan and Canton, but all of them have lost many of their scales, and also in

some degree their proper shape, by maceration in spirits. A section of the body has the form

of a thin wedge, broadest near the back, which is rounded by the swelling muscles of the

sides, and attenuated towards the acute belly. There is no appearance of there ever

having been much projection at the inferior lateral line, so as to render the section quadran-

gular. This line runs near the edge of the belly from the lower part of the operculum nearly

to the caudal fin. It is formed by a simple or in some places a forked tube on each scale.

The preorbitar is sub-elliptical, with an undulated disc and a minute central umbo. Its

anterior edge describes the quadrant of a circle ; its posterior one is much less curved. The

dorsal and anal are opposite to each other at their commencement, and the former reaches a

little nearer to the caudal, though it has fewer rays than the anal. The lower lobe of the

caudal is the longest, as usual. The back is greenish, the sides silvery, and there is a broad

lateral stripe more brilliantly silvery than the rest, which dilates between the dorsal and anal.

The following measurements furnish the comparative lengths of the several parts. Length from

the point of the upper jaw to end of caudal, 5'25 inches. From ditto to gill-opening, 0"91

inch. From ditto to anus, 3'38 inches. Length of upper jaw, 0'2 inch. Length from point of
lower jaw to end of caudal, 6'35 inches. From ditto to angle of mouth, 1'38 inch. From

ditto to fore-edge of orbit, 1-6 inch. From ditto to gill-opening, 2-18 inches.

  A specimen of this fish was brought from China by Sir Edward Belcher. It is probably

the same species with the cvolans of Bloch (398) ; but in his figure the ventrals are as near
to the end of the snout as to the beginning of the anal, while in the Chinese specimen the
distance from the snout to the ventrals, when carried backwards, reaches past the middle of
the anal ; in other respects there appears to be little difference. The same officer brought
several specimens of young flying fish from the Chinese seas, evidently of the same species,
but none of them exceeding 2A inches in length. All these have the profile of the face more
curved, with a variable degree of gibbosity of the nape. They have also two brown spots on
the top of the occiput, formed by a congeries of small specks. Ail the specimens are so much

   Sir Edward Belcher brought an Exoctetus from the sea of China which seems to belong to

this species, but the specimen having been preserved in salt, the colours have perished and the
fins are mutilated in their length. It agrees however with fasciaius in the approximation of
the large eye to the end of the snout, in which it differs from Ex. exiliens of Bloch (397). It
has also a similar degree of concavity between the eyes with that exhibited in M. Lesueur's
figure (fig. 2. 6) ; and there is a correspondence also in other parts. The fins look dark.

ExociETUS MONOCiRRHUs, Richardson. Had. D. 13; A. 13; C. 15f;

    Several Exoceeti having barbels have been figured, viz. Ex. nuthalii (Lesueur), furcatus
of Mitchell, and. appendiculatus of Wood, which have a plurality of these appendages, and
comatus of Mitchell, which is described as having only a single one, but which agrees with
the others that have been named in the backward position of the ventrals resembling exiliens.

   A species with two very short barbels, inhabiting the seas of Polynesia, has the ventrals

placed as in Ex.mesogaster of Bloch (399), but in it the pectoral reaches only to the fore
part of the anal, and it is distinguished from all other ExoccBti by the size and height of its
dorsal, which is black on the upper half. This fish was taken by Banks and Solander at
Otaheite, and is named in the manuscripts of the latter Ex. brachypterus, Parkinson's figure
of it is numbered 108.

   In a small Exoceetus, which was obtained by Sir Edward Belcher on the coast of China and
which we have named monocirrhus, the distance from the end of the snout to the ventrals, when
carried backwards, does not reach to the middle of the anal ; and the pectoral extends a little
beyond the base of the caudal. The eye is rather larger than that of volans, and is situated
at a similar distance from the end of the snout. The barbel, which is black and wrinkled,
springs from the end of the chin, and is flat or furrowed on the surface that applies to the mem-
brane between the jaws. It does not equal the head in length, but it may perhaps have lost
a small part of its tip. There is no trace of a minute lateral barbel such as is shown in Mr,
Wood's figure of appendiculatus (Journ. Ac. Sc. Phil. iv. p. 283. pi. 17. f. 2).

   It is possible that this species may be a Pholis, Petroscirtes or Salarias, but in the absence
of information respecting its dentition and gill-openings, we cannot say to which of the genera
established in the ' Histoire des Poissons' it properly belongs. It has much of the aspect of
a Blenny, and has a vertical face and crested head like the males of Blennius pavo, and of
some other species. The body is longer than of the fish just named, and the first seven dorsal
rays are elongated, the remainder of the fin being even. The body is wax-yellow, with a
brownish bar faintly indicated on the posterior part of the lateral line, and five rows of bright
golden specks intermingled with much smaller and more numerous black dots in seven or
eight rows. The head and all the fins, except the anal, are bright king's yellow. The crest
is dotted with black, and a bar of that hue descends from it through the eye to the corner of
the mouth. There is also a round black mark on the middle of the fore -part of the dorsal,
comprising the first four rays. The anal is reddish-orange or buff, passing into yellow at its
base. Length of the figure nearly 4 inches.

the Rev. George Vachell, enables us to give a short account of this species. It differs from

obtusata in having two points to the gill-cover, and from all the species that have been hitherto

figured, in its higher shoulder and more concave profile. The specimen does not exhibit this

peculiarity of form so strongly as the figure, but it is flaccid and may have lost its exact shape.

Canine teeth acute, subulate and slightly flexuose, like the italic s. Two on each side,

widely set on the upper jaw, with small lateral teeth pointing backwards, not arranged by

Athrees but with intervals, as if one had fallen out here and there.  few tall, compressed,

lancet-shaped teeth arm the palate-bones, and smaller teeth of the same form stand in a single

row on the limbs of the lower jaw, their size augmenting gradually as they near the corner of

the mouth ; two canines standing contiguously on the tip of the jaw. No teeth on the small

chevron 'of the vomer. The gill-cover shows two small, slender, flat points, the upper one

being rather the longest. Lateral line almost straight ; torulose.

     I have had an opportunity of examining several specimens of this fish, viz. two brought
 from the neighbourhood of Canton by Captain Dawkins and Sir Edward Belcher, and one
 from the mouth of the Van tze kiang by Sir Everard Home, besides some injured ones, all of
 this species. They agree in the height of the body, which is greatest some way behind the
 anus or nearly in the middle, being equal to one-fourteenth of the whole length ; the head*

     * Measured between the tip of the snout and end of gill-flap. As the lower jaw projects

being equal to one-ninth, and the iinless tip of the tail to a tenth. The lateral line runs about
two-fifths of the height from the edge of the belly, and three from the summit of the back.
The distance between the tip of the snout and fore-edge of the orbit is one-third of the length of
the head. There are upwards of fifteen very faint streaks on the preorbitar. The margin
of the upper jaw is curved at the junction of the intermaxillary and maxillary, and the former
bone carries ten small teeth, exclusive of the canine one, while the latter is armed by only seven,
vf hich are somewhat larger. The maxillary can retire wholly under the preorbitar, and scarcely
reaches the orbit. The canine teeth have a thin posterior edge at the tip, which ends
abruptly, producing a barb which is too minute to be seen jby the naked eye, and not to be
compared with the acute arrow-headed tooth of Tr. Upturns, as represented in Bl. Schn. t.
100. The small teeth are enlarged by similar edges at the base, the tips being narrower and
roundish. Top of the head flattish without an acute ridge. The spines on the under edge
of the tail are so minute that they cannot be reckoned even by aid of a lens in a plump per-
fect specimen. In one a little decayed, they are seen to be the clear pungent tips of the inter-
spinous bones, with which they agree in number, amounting to about 110 6r more. There
are two spinous points on the hinder edge of the very small anus. Length, 14"15 inches.

    I have been unable to refer this figure to any described species. It has nearly the proportions
and general form of Ch. commersonianus, but it wants the spots, and has a more obtuse snout
and larger ventrals. The profile is incurved over the eye which renders the snout gibbous.
The eye is large. The lateral line makes a small arch at its commencement and is then waved
twice slightly up and down under the spinous dorsal, the remainder being quite straight from
the third or fourth soft ray to the caudal. The scales appear to be very minute, deeply im-
bedded in the satiny skin and not close to each other. Most of the fish is brightly silvery,
but the back is deep lavender-purple, which fades away before it reaches the lateral line. The
snout and temples are shaded with the same, and there is a large blackish-purple patch on
the upper and posterior parts of the operculum. The supra-scapular region is brightly sil-
very, as is also the iris, which has a yellow ring round it. The pectorals are cream-yellow,
shaded at the base with brown. The teeth are shown small, setaceous, and thickly set on
 both jaws. Length of figure 16 inches.

    This figure has much the general form of Bloch's aculeatus, but differs in the mouth being
 cleft beyond the middle of the head, and consequently passing the eye considerably. Its
snout is also more gibbous at the nostrils. It may possibly be the young of some of the
 spotted species. In the size of its mouth it appears to coincide with exoleius, but the lateral
 line wants the undulations which are noticed in the description which is given of that fish in
 the ' Histoire des Poissons.' The cleft of its mouth is larger than that of leucophthalmus. The
 lateral line makes an angle over the pectoral and afterwards continues straight without any
 undulation whatever. In the figure the back is illuminated by a clouded mixture of delicate
 sienna-yeUow, having metallic lustre and pale siskin-green, the parts below the lateral line

eye, the temporal groove is shaded by the same, and there are a few diverging brown streaks

    This species makes the nearest approach to Tr. mokalee, but its snout is not so high, and
its colour differs. The British Museum possesses a specimen from Macao which measures
9 inches in length; but it attains a greater size, as Mr. Reeves's figure measures 14 inches.
The height is equal to twice the length, including the central caudal rays. The snout is not
vertical as in mokalee, but is very convex, the profile running nearly straight, or scarcely
arched, from the nostrils to the dorsal with a slope of about forty degrees. The points of the
dorsal and anal are a little less acute and falcate than in mokalee. The caudal is deeply
forked, the length of its lobes being equal to half the height of the body. First jointed rays of
dorsal and ana! compressed but strong, lateral line undulated. The colour is a bright saffron-
yellow, with much lustre, which gives place on the breast and along the belly and base of the
anal to a pure silvery colour. The head is also yellow, with silvery lower jaw and edges of
the gill-pieces : a blue tint spreads round the nostrils. The dorsal and pectorals are dark
hair-brown, the former with a pale edge. The ventrals are bluish white, and are smaller than

the pectorals ; the anal is tinged with orange, and the caudal, mostly coloured like the dorsal,

is edged in the depth of the fork with yellow.  r

   In the Chinese collection at Hyde Park, there are two specimens of a Trachinotus of an-
other species, but having the same number of dorsal spines with the preceding. I examined
them only in a very cursory manner.

   The Tr. anomalus of the 'Fauna Japonica ' is described solely from the figure which was
executed in Japan. It may therefore prove, when better known, to be the same species with
the Chinese one represented in Mr. Reeves's drawing. Of this an example exists in the Museum
of the Cambridge Philosophical Institution, which was brought from Canton by the Rev.
George Vachell. It has the same elliptical profile with ano7nalus,bM its snout is more obtuse
and sufficiently gibbous at the nostrils to project a little beyond the mouth. Mouth small.
Nostrils two round contiguous openings before the eye. Eye large. Anus between the tips
of the ventrals immediately before the anal fin, no free spines intervening. Head nacry, with-
out scales. Scales of the body very minute and tender, but not deciduous. Lateral line
nearly straight, without any semblance of a keel or armature posteriorly. There are no
scales on the vertical fins. The spines of the dorsal have been omitted by the artist, and they
may be very readily overlooked when recumbent : they are seven in number, exclusive of
the recumbent ones. The first is very short, and the sixth is shorter than the fifth, so that
the spinous part has a very slightly arched shape, and is almost as distinct from the soft part as
in some Sciteniilee, which are described as having two dorsals. The sixth spine equals the
fifth one in length, and belongs more properly to the soft fin, which is not in any way pointed
or falcate. The second anal spine is as long as the third one, and is stronger and somewhat
curved. Pectorals moderate size. Ventral spines short : these ventrals, from the thinness of
the belly, are contiguous. The fish generally is brilliantly nacry or silvery, with a bluish-gray
tint along the back and at the bases of the opercular pieces. There is a wood-brown tint on
the nape, and a gloss of the same on the sides. The fins are transparent, and the dorsal is
traversed by a faint stripe below its middle ; and another faint brownish stripe a little arched
runs from the temples to the trunk of the tail. The muscles shine through the integuments
of the sides, producing stripes bent en chevron, first at the brown stripe and then in the oppo-

   Another Trachinotus, resembling the preceding, but apparently not the same, exists in the
Chinese collection at Hyde Park. Its numbers are Rays, D. 8|16; A. 3|16i V. 1|5, &c.
The first dorsal spine is very small, the second one is the highest, and is large and greatly
compressed. The first anal spine also is very short, the second one strong, and the third one
as tall as the second, but slender, delicate, and looking like a soft ray. The examination of

this specimen was too hurried to enable me to record other particulars.

   A specimen brought from Canton by the Rev. George Vachell exists in the Museum of the
Cambridge Philosophical Institution. Its rays differ a little from the numbers given by Riip-

pell, but the profile so closely corresponds that I have little hesitation in considering it to be
his species. The dorsal spines are arched, the third one being tallest, and the first, seventh
and eighth very short. Scales small and deeply imbedded. Lateral line completing its curve
under the fourteenth or fifteenth soft dorsal rays, keeled in the tail and armed with minute
closely-incumbent shields, which gradually pass into a torulose line as they approach the

curve.

A specimen obtained by the Rev. George Vachell at Macao was presented by him to the

Cambridge Philosophical Institution. It agrees with the plate in the ' Histoire des Poissons,'

except in the profile, from the nostrils to the mouth being rather more oblique, as represented

in Bloch's plate, 192. f. 1. The teeth are minute in several rows below, in one or two above.
The scales of the body are invisible to the naked eye, but may be detected by a common eye-

glass.  The  lateral  line  is  composed of tubes,  giving  it  a  torulose  appearance                                                           and  on the

slender part of the tail the little eminences become wider, making approach to obtuse shields.

The usual recumbent spine exists before the dorsal, and it is preceded by three interspinous

bones whose thin nail-like heads show through the integumeot. There are also two inter-

spinous bones protruding before the anal. The anterior filamentous branches of the first four

dorsal and anal rays are black, and the anal also is black. Mr. Reeves's drawing is very sil-

very, with a faint diffused blush of red-lilac-purple, and four vertical bands of that colour

a little darker, but still very pale. There are crimson blotches on the base of the pectorals,

the inner edge of the ventrals, and under part of the anal and dorsal. Length of figure

6 inches.

This individual presented no other difference in form from auro-vittata, except that the teeth
were a little shorter and more closely villiform. It measured ten inches, and the specimen

of auro-vittata, with which it was carefully compared, exceeded it by only one inch.

thyology of the Voyage of the Erebus and Terror,' on the 1st of March 1845. I do not know
the date of the letter-press of the ' Fauna Japonica' describing Erythrichthys. The Australian

species differs in the form of its preorbitar and in the dorsal spines. The genus seems to me
to be more allied to the Sparoid or Maenoid families than to the Scomberoid, from which it

differs in its ptenoid scales.

   Mr. Reeves presented a specimen to the British Museum. No spines protrude through the
skin in front of the dorsal, but six or seven interspinous bones show through the thick integu-
ment. Two or three rays of the anal also are deeply concealed in the front of the fin. This
specimen, compared with Russell's figure oi candidus (pi. 42), was found to differ in the po-
sition of the anus relative to the anal fin, and to want the streaks in the supra-scapular region,
there being only a few on the nape. The operculum itself is marked by stria; diverging from
its upper anterior corner. The profile is a little gibbous behind the eye, and as evenly curved
as in Candidas. The specimen measured 11^ inches in length, and the figure 14|^; the body

being 7^ high in the latter.

   The British Museum possesses a Chinese specimen. One spine can be observed incumbent
on the front of the dorsal, but the other three are concealed. The specimen measures 14^

inches, the figure nearly 11. There is a greater distance between the anus and anal fin in
this species than in the preceding one. The lateral line is decidedly keeled, and the fins are
less pointed than they are represented to be in Bloch's fig. 160, and much less than in his
plate 422. The colour is yellowish-gray with lilac and purple tints by no means dark, so
that the name of niger is not appropriate.

This fish has the same close resemblance to Stromateus niger that Seserinus microchirus

lias to Stromatevs fiatola. The Prince of Canino has replaced the Mediterranean Seserinus

in the genus Stromateus, but the discovery of the Chinese species with larger venlrals and a

keeled lateral line justifies Cuvier's separation of the two forms. The Rev. George Vachell

brought two specimens from Canton of the Seserinus which we have named in honour of him.

It is a greatly compressed fish, which is thickest at the orbits, the height of its body being only

a quarter less than the length, caudal excluded. The acute nuchal ridge vanishes in the inter-

Aorbital space, which is however not flat.  recumbent spine is placed in front of the dorsal, and

five erect ones are so buried in front of the fin that they can be detected only by dissection.

The fifth spine has a long, flexible, but not jointed tip, which is also concealed ; the others are
pungent. The first anal spine is short, the third one a quarter of the length of the soft rays,

and the second one of intermediate length. Both the dorsal and anal are falcate. The pec-

torals are long and falcate, their tips reaching over two-thirds of the anal. Ventrals small,

falcate or pointed, attached beneath the corner of the preoperculum, and having the anus be-

tween their tips. Tail slender, caudal deeply forked. Scales small, the lateral line torulose

or keeled on the tail by soft triangular plates, which have an acute point that catches the fin-

ger when drawn back. These plates are small, and when examined with a lens appear to be

formed of two divergent tubes, with the acute point rising from the disc they enclose.

Eye distant from the profile. Preoperculum and operculum striated. Lower jaw when

depressed longer than the upper one. Teeth as fine as hairs, slightly curved in one close row

on both jaws. Colour gone.

therein referred to that species, has a more 'flatly curved lateral line ; and there is a second
figure 75 in Mr. Reeves's portfolio with another Chinese name which presents some differences,
though slight, from rotleri. There are fewer detached finlets, the pectoral fin is shorter, does
not quite reach to the anal, and is contained above four times in the total length of the fish
and the black spot on the gill-plate, instead of being high up on the operculum, is on the
middle of its edge, as in the woragoo. The numbers of shields on the lateral line and of the
rays of the fins are nearly the same as in rottleri, but the curved commencement of the line

  A specimen of this Caranx was brought from Canton by the Rev. George Vachell, and pre-

sented by him to the Cambridge Philosophical Institution. It belongs to the group of luna
(Histoire des Poissons, ix. p. 80), which have the teeth in a single row. They are scarcely
perceptible, except througli the aid of a lens. The species differs from C. platcssa and geor-
gianus and others of the group in the numbers of its rays and extent of armature of the late-
ral line. The form is elliptical, the height of body being to the length, caudal included, as
one to three. The profile from the mouth to the dorsal is sloping with a moderate convexity,
and corresponds in its obliquity and curvature with the under profile from ventrals to tip of

lower jaw. Pectorals as long as the head, and equal to one-fourth of the length of the fish.

Lateral line straight and cuirassed forward to the beginning of the anal, the shields embracing
nearly the whole height of the tail behind that fin. No spots are shown on the operculum
or elsewheie. The back is coloured olive-green, and the sides and belly brightly silvery,
with a tinge of lake on the breast. The fins are transparent, without any darkening on their

edges, and have an uniform pale greenish hue. Length of the drawing 4^ inches.

are strong and pointed, and run forward to beneath the beginning of the second dorsal. The
lateral line appears to be but slightly arched over the pectoral. In form the fish is regularly
elliptical, the ventral and dorsal curves equal, and not more convex in the anterior than in
the posterior half of the ellipse. Height one-third of the length, including the central caudal
rays. Head forming a fourth of the same length. Snout rather acute. Eye somewhat large.
Teeth apparently in a single row, small and slender. Pectorals falcate, reaching over the an-
terior quarter of the anal. This fin and the dorsal are acute and higher anteriorly, but not so
much so as to be falcate. The spinous dorsal one quarter lower than the fore-part of the second
fin. Three anal spines are shown as incumbent on the first soft ray of the anal, but ne free

bable that such exist. Colour of the back olive-green, with a diffused yellow tinge over the
lateral line and temples. There is a very slight tint of lake along the under side of the la-
teral line, and the under parts are pearly and silvery. Pectorals and ventrals pure sulphur-
yellow, the former having a carmine streak across the base, edged with bluish-gray. There is

Aalso a reddish stripe along the bases of the dorsal and anal, and the tips are red. small black

spot exists on the edge of the gill-cover, and the membrane connecting the last ten dorsal rays

is tipped with black.

Atropus is therefore the prior specific name, but being compounded of Greek and Latin it is
objectionable, and may be allowed to give place to the appellation of the same import proposed

in the 'Histoire des Poissons.' M. Valenciennes states that a specimen preserved in Bloch's
museum is labelled Brama melampus and Scomber ciliaris. Examples of the species from
China exist in the British Museum and the Chinese collection at Hyde Park.

    This figure closely resembles that of chrysophrys in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' except

that the snout is rather blunter ; there is a small incurvature of the profile at the nostrils, the

points of the dorsal and anal are scarcely so long, and the cheek, as well as the belly nearly
to the anal spines, are represented scaleless. The golden tint of the eyebrow is very obscure.

    This Caranx much resemhles C. flavo-caruleus or caiicroides in its profile, its height heing
one-third of the total length, and the space between the snout and first dorsal flatly arched,
not steep, as in the Carangi. The breast is scaly, but no scales are shown on the cheek, nor any
teeth in the jaws. The arch of the lateral line terminates over the beginning of the anal and
under the ninth ray of the second dorsal, the straight part being pretty strongly armed by
about eighteen or twenty bucklers. The spines of the first dorsal are rather tall and stout, and
the fin ends at the foot of the second. The fish has a pearly hue throughout, with some faint
yellow tints on the upper half of the body and forehead. The caudal and anal are saffron-
yellow, the first dorsal and ventrals French-gray, and the second dorsal greenish-gray with
yellowish front rays. Length of figure 4*32 inches, height of body 1'50 inch.

   The authors of the ' Fauna Japonica' mention that the specimens they examined were in
bad condition, otherwise I should have hesitated in referring Mr. Reeves's most beautiful and
elaborately finished drawing to the species established by them, on account of a difference in
their relative heights. Mr. Reeves's figure shows the height of the body to be half the length
to the base of the caudal; but the description in the ' Fauna Japonica' gives to it a more
elongated form, and we have not seen the plate. The fish, as represented in Mr. Reeves's
drawing, is brightly silvery, with pale, wood-brown, short undulating bars pretty closely
ranged in two or three rows above the lateral line. They are continued down the sides by
silvery streaks. The fins are pale, slightly ochraceous, with a brighter yellow tint at the be-

ginning of the dorsal and anal.

   We cannot refer this figure to any of the foregoing Cepola, nor, on account of the numbers

of the rays, to abbrtviatus, of which we have seen neither figure nor detailed description.
Height at the pectorals equal to the length of the head, or to one-tenth of the whole length
of the fish. The upper and under profiles incline evenly and gradually to each other, and
meet in an acute point at the tail. The fins are highest anteriorly and diminish in height like
the body, also meeting in an acute point, the caudal not being distinguished by longer rays
from the adjoining parts of the other two vertical fins. The anal is higher than the dorsal.
Ventrals exactly under the pectorals. The whole surface of the body is divided into almost
square rhombs by yellow lines, and there is a nacry spot in the centre of each. There are only
ninety-four of these rhombs in a line between the gill-opening and point of the tail, so that
they are greatly larger than the scales of the other CepolcB. The general tint is pale ochre-
yellow passing into reddish- orange on the back, and there are eighteen equidistant gamboge-
yellow spots on the middle of the sides, the yellow tint confined to the lines dividing the scales
from one another. These spots are much larger than those of krusensternii and not in pairs.
The orbits and top of the head are shaded with carmine, and there is a carmine stripe along
the middle of the dorsal, the edge of the fin being saffron-yellow and the base pearl-gray.
The anal is lake at the base, white along the middle, and saffron-yellow edged interiorly with
lake on the border. Pectorals yellow. Ventrals lake. Length of the drawing 12 inches.

    Mr. Reeves figures two examples of this species, one with the eyes on the right side, the
other on the left ; and the figure given by Mr. Gray in Hardwicke's ' Illustrations of Indian
Zoology,' was drawn from one of Mr. Reeves's Canton specimens deposited in the British
Museum. The general colour of the upper side is dull umber, clouded faintly with liver-
brown, with scattered small black spots, each surrounded by a pale ring. The fins are also
brown, and the vertical ones are marked by rather large, well-defined, roundish, dark liver-
brown spots, most crowded on the caudal, which is rhomboidal. Length 6 and 10 inches.

   This drawing differs little in appearance from 107, Platessa chinensis. The ground tint
and shadings are nearly the same, the black spots want the pale borders, and the blotches on
the fins run into each other and form a border of grayish-black. The caudal is less rhom-

crossed by several dark brown bands, one on the nape, another broad one behind the pec-

   Mr. Reeves's drawing 104 answers better than any other one in his portfolio to the short
characters of chrysoptera contained in Schneider's edition of Bloch, and this is our only rea-
son for considering it to be the same species.

   The ground tint of the drawing is brownish-red or orange-coloured brown, with numerous
minute specks of umber and irregular rings of the same equally dispersed over the body with
paler dull areas. The fins are wax-yellow, with reddish rays spotted with brown. Caudal

   Two of the Rev. George Vachell's specimens of this fish exist in the Cambridge Philoso-
phical Institution, and small ones are very common in the China insect-boxes. It belongs to

the subdivision of the genus which is characterized by the blending together of the three ver-
tical fins, and is very much like the Indian Solea zebra, but it is not so much elongated, and
has a peculiar eye-like mark on the caudal fin, formed by several yellow spots, inclosed by a
bright yellow parallelogram, of which one side is deficient. The body is crossed by about
twenty-three vertical whitish bars, alternately broader and narrower, and bent backwards,
where they run out on the fins. The intermediate spaces are wood-brown on the body and
blackish on the fins ; short bars radiate forward from the eyes on the snout.

   The eyes are on the right side, and are small and nearly contiguous. The teeth, if any
exist, are invisible to the naked eye. The left lips and gill-membranes are fringed, and the
latter are united to the pectorals, the union of the left gill-membrane being more conspicuous.
The scales on both sides of the fish are strongly ciliated and run up on the fin-rays. The
lateral line is straight. Length of the figure 8^ inches. The specimens are smaller.

    In form this species is intermediate between the Jerree potoo, B, Russell, 81, and Jerree potoo,
C, i2 J and in the geminate distribution of its vertical stripes it agrees with neither.

   The British Museum possesses Chinese examples of this fish presented by Mr. Reeves, and
two specimens from Chusan, which were collected there by Dr. Cantor, and came from him
through the India House, labelled S. jnmctatus and nanus. The labels have evidently been

accidentally transposed, and could not have been attached by Dr. Cantor to these specimens, as
they want the black lateral spots and black edges to the pectorals, which he mentions in his
description oi puvctatus, and no account of a species named nanus is contained in his paper
on the Fauna of Chusan.

   This and the preceding species belong to the group of Siluri, which have short faces and
projecting lower jaws, embracing the upper lip when the mouth is shut, and giving them,
together with an accompanying elevation of the shoulder, more or less the aspect of a Schilbe.
S. xanthosteus is distinguished at once from the present species by the union of the anal and

caudal, as in S. glanis or asotus, Lacepede's figure of S. sinensis is too rude to be of much
use, and we are quite of M. Valenciennes' opinion when he says that it is by no means pre-
cise enough to serve for the establishment of a species. Mr. M'Clelland has however had an
opportunity of examining a Silurus from Chusan, which he has referred to Lacepede's species ;
and Mr. Ileeves's drawing above-quoted answers better to the description of the colours and
markings of «in<'H5ii than to any species introduced into the Histoire des Poissons.' His
drawing represents a fish with the nape but sparingly elevated, and having a caudal slightly
notched in the middle with rounded equal lobes, the lower one distinct from the anal. The
maxillary barbel reaches nearly to the end of the pectoral ; tlie barbels of the lower jaw are
not quite half as long. The lateral line runs straight, a little above the mid-height, and ia
marked by a series of yellowish white points, whicli are met at right angles by about fourteen
short rows of the same kind of dots descending at regular intervals from the back. The ground
colour of the body is oil-green passing into yellowish-gray, and is reticulated by irregular
meshes of neutral tint of a deeper colour. The meshes disappear in the darker hue of the
summit of tlie back which approaches to blackish-green, and do not spread over the belly,
which is white ; but they descend lower at the anus, and include the posterior two-thirds of
the anal. The ground colour is mostly silvery below the lateral line, but a buff-coloured band
runs along the base of the anal, reticulated like the rest of the body. The dorsal, caudal and

border of the anal are oil-green ; the basal part of tlie anal being lilac-purple, with the darkfr
reticulations posteriorly. The pectorals are lilac at the base, dull green on the disc, and have
a yellow border. The ventrals are pale greenish-yellow with a lilac tint. The upper parts
of the head are yellowish-brown with a purplish blush and without spots. Length of the

figure 14^ inches.

   These references are given entirely on the authority of Mr. M'Clelland. Having the In-
dian fish under liis eye, his opportunity for comparing it with his Chusan specimen is good
and it is important that a scrupulous comparison should be made, as this is one of the very
few instances in which the same species of freshwater fish has been detected in India and
China. The pointed caudal lobes distinguish this species from the foregoing ones.

line without any rounding before the dorsal. The maxillary barbels reach to the gill-opening',
the exterior submandibular pair are half as long, and the interior pair a quarter as long. The
operculum is finely veined, and the roughness of the nuchal plate is shown in the drawing by
fine gold points. The lateral line is flatly arched over the pectoral, and takes a straight course
from the tip of that fin to the caudal rather above mid-height. The points of the ribs form
an oblique line from the shoulder to the anal. The dorsal and pectoral spines are slender and
serratfed in front: their posterior teeth, if they possess any, are not shown in the drawing.
The top of the head, nape and back is sap-green, with fine parallel streaks of a deeper tint,
bent en chevron near the dorsal line, and disappearing at the lateral line ; the sides and belly
are silvery with a purplish reflexion. There are some crimson tints round the mouth, and
purplish ones at the union of the gill-pieces and on the breast; also a greenish-yellow border
round the end of the tail embraced by the caudal. The dorsal is celandine-green, with darker
rays tinged with crimson at the base. The adipose fin is yellow, with a black spot on the
edge. The pectorals and ventrals have crimson-coloured rays and buff membranes. The anal
is sulphur-yellow and the caudal a dingy wax-yellow. This drawing agrees in several par-

ticulars with the description of Arius ocellatus noticed below.

   None of Mr. Reeves's drawings represent this fish, which was brought from Carrton by the
Rev. G. Vachell ; the only one that it resembles in having eight barbels being the Pimelodus ?
fulvi'draeo noticed below. From this it is distinguished by all the fins being edged with black,
and the specimen shows no traces of the peculiar markings of fulvi-draco. I examined it
cursorily, and noted down only a few of its characters. There is a short viliform dental plate
on the vomer, set more densely and with shorter teeth than the jaws, and continued without
a break over the mesial line. The casque terminates over the base of the pectorals, but sends

out a narrow styloid process which touches the small chevron of the second interspinous bone.

The adipose fin rises imperceptibly from the dorsal line, and the ventrals are smaller than

those of fi. ? crinalis, and do not reach to the anus. The ventrals have six rays, the last of

Awhich is divided to the base.  supra-axillary plate is half the length of the pectorals, and

the nasal cirrhus is short.

  A specimen of this fish exists in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park, but we have .not ex-

amined the palate so as to ascertain from its dentition whether it is properly placed in this
genus or not. If it be a Bagrus it belongs to the group which have eight barbels, a long anal
and a comparatively short adipose fin. It comes nearest to B. vacha (Buch. Ham.) of any
member of the group described in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' but may be at once distinguished
by its much smaller mouth and fleshy lips. The head. Viewed in profile, is depressed, taper-
ing and rather pointed, with the eye rather nearer to the gill-opening than to the end of the
snout. The lower jaw is shorter than the snout, and the mouth is not cleft so far back as the
posterior nostrils. Which are about midWay between the eye and end of the snout. The nape
rises suddenly in an arch from the hind head, and then runs backwards with little ascent to
the first dorsal. The height of the body there is equal to the length of the head, or to one-
fifth of the total length of the fish. The maxillary barbels are rather longer than the head
the exterior submandibular ones are a third shorter, while the nasal barbels and the interior
submandibular ones are a little longer than the quarter of the length of the head. The lateral
line is arched at the commencement, and then runs nearly straight from before the first dor-

 sal to the caudal, a little above the middle height of the body. [In B. buckanani, Val.,
 the lateral line is straight from end to end.] The pectoral spine is strong, and is strongly

serrated towards its dp interiorly. A triangular plate proceeding from the humeral chain is
 shown very boldly in the figure above the fin. The dorsal spine is drawn without serratures,

 taller than the soft rays, pretty stout and rather spindle-shaped, with a tapering acute point.
 Six soft rays are shown. The ventrals are pretty large, but smaller than the pectorals ; the
 anal long, containing above thirty rays; the adipose fin of a moderate size, and the caudal
 deeply forked, but with the lobes rather obtuse and equal. The colour on the dorsal aspect

 is dark mountain-green or greenish-gray, passing high on the sides into sienna-yellow, which
 continues down to the pale lilac edge of the belly. There are no spots. The fins have all
 more or less of lake or crimson-red with greenish rays. The two colours are most distinctly

 separated on the anal, the base being rose-red or carmine, and the outer half grass-green.

   In the ' Description of Animals,' &c., which we have repeatedly quoted, there is a sketch
(fig. 162) of a Siluroid with a short adipose fin and long anal, which I should have referred to
B. houderius, but for the shortness and number of the barbels, which are stated in the text to
be only four; and only two are shown in the drawing, the maxillary one, which is the
longest, being shorter than the he^id, and the submandibular one still smaller. The nostrils
are shown without cirrhi, and the belly is more prominent than that of Reeves's bouderius. In
the text (p. 191) the head is said to be " naked and somewhat depressed, the body compressed,

   A specimen of this fish exists in the collection of the Cambridge Philosophical Institution,

to which it was presented by the Rev. G. Vachell. In the form of the adipose fin and general
outline it resembles Mr. Reeves's drawing 203, which is described above under the appellation
of Bagrus 1 bnuderius, but the anal fin is not so extensive. In the hasty record I made of its
characters, I unfortunately omitted to note the exact nature of the dental plates on the roof
of the mouth, having merely written that the teeth are disposed in broad, close shorn villiform
plates ; so there remains an uncertainty as to the genus which cannot be cleared up without
a re-examination of the specimen. The mouth is small, and the under jaw is shorter than the
snout, which is round. The maxillary barbels are as long as the head and larger than the
olhers ; the interior submandibular pair equal the nasal ones, and are shorter than the exte-
rior submandibular ones. They are all slender. The dorsal spine is smooth in front, but is
armed with recurved teeth behind. The pectoral spine is also smooth in front, but it is

strongly toothed behind. Many short rays are incumbent on the base of the caudal, above
and below. Three front rays of the anal are short and graduated, and the last dorsal ray is
divided to the base. The specimen is five inches long. In the number of the anal rays this

specimen nearly agrees with Arius ocellatus introduced below.

     I have referred this figure to Galeichthys on account of its resemblance to G.feliceps, C.

 above, with less appearance of a casque than in the figure oifeliceps above-quoted. The gra-
 nulations of a narrow interparietal process and a small crutch at the base of the dorsal spine
 are however shown. The head is wide and depressed, with a rounded snout, and forms about
 one-fourth of the total length of the fish. The height of the body is equal to rather more
 than a fifth of the length. The nasal orifices are round without either valves or barbels.
 The maxillary barbels are shorter than the head, but are longer than the exterior subman-

dibular pair, and more than twice as long as the interior pair. Tliere is a large triangular

plate of the humeral chain above the pectoral which is covered with smooth skin. The dorsal

and pectoral spines are long and rather slender, the former being equal to two-thirds of the

height of the fish .and serrated both before and behind. The latter is also serrated on both

sides, but only at the tip. The adipose fin rises abruptly from the back, and is small ; the

anal is of moderate size j behind these fins the tail becomes narrower than usual in a siluroid,

but again expands where it is embraced by the base of the caudal. The caudal is deeply

forked with acute lobes. The lateral line is arched at the shoulder, and descends to the

middle height of the body over the ventrals, its course to the caudal fin being straight from

thence. The general colour is violet-purple passing into Scotch-blue, and gradually changing

Ato a bright silvery tint on the lower part of the sides and under surface of the head.  series

of chevrons are shown between the ventrals and pectorals evidently corresponding to the ribs.

The under fins are bluish, the dorsal and caudal purplish brown. Length of the drawing,

   This species was known to Lacepede only by a Chinese drawing; and thougli Mr. Reeves's
drawings present both a top and side view whereby we can perceive that the fish has no casque,
yet from our ignorance of the dentition we cannot say positively that it belongs to the genus

Pimelodus as constituted in the ' Histoire des Poissons.' It has considerable resemblance to
Bagrus cavasius, possessing the eight barbels, long adipose and short anal which characterise

the group to which that species belongs, and which is equivalent to the genus Porcus of M.
Geoffroy St. Hilaire. On the other hand,' it has also the external characters of the Pimelodes,
with a round head destitute of a casque and with eight barbels. In profile the head appears
conical and rather slender, with an acute snout which projects beyond the lower jaw, the face

and nape rising in a straight gentle acclivity to the dorsal. Viewed from above, the snout is
broadly rounded; there is no appearance of a casque, and the distance between the eyes is
equal to a third of the length of the head. The head forms one-fourth of the length of the
fish, caudal excluded ; and the height of the body at the commencement of the dorsal is nearly
equal to a sixth of the length, caudal included. The maxillary barbels reach to the tip of
the pectoral. The outer pair of submandibular barbels are less than half that length, and the
other two and the nasal pair are still shorter. The pectoral spine is stout and very strongly
toothed behind, but no teeth are shown on the dorsal one in either figure. The dorsal termi-
nates over the first ventral ray, and the adipose fin commencing over the axilla of the ventrals
extends far past the anal and almost to the caudal, being nearly equal in length to a third of
the fish. The caudal is deeply notched with thick, rounded equal lobes. The lateral line
has a very slight decurvature as far as the ventrals, but is otherwise nearly straight and rather
nearer to the belly than to the back. The supra-axillary plate of the humeral chain is drawn
narrow and rather long. The colour of the back, top of the head and breast is brownish purple-

red ; the sides and belly white, with a faint wax-yellow or siskin-green reflexion. Many

transverse bars are shown, that meet en chevron near the back, and again less sharply at the
lateral line, which is green. The body, adipose fin, and caudal and the rays of the dorsal and
ventrals are marked with many scattered black spots of irregular shapes and sizes. The dor-
sal, adipose and caudal are yellowish-brown at the base, the rays of the pectoral are greenish,
and those of the ventrals and anal carmine. The membranes of most of the fins appear to be
thin and transparent.

   This is seemingly another representation of the same species, with the outline a little dis-
torted from the example placed before the artist having been in a more limber state. Hence
the profile, instead of rising from the snout in a straight acclivity, is undulated by the compa-
rative depression of the head and swelling out of the nape. Some serratures are shown at
the tip of the dorsal spine, and the silvery supra-axillary plate of the humeral chain is notched,
as in the figure of B. cavasius (Jacquemont, Voy. de I'Inde, pi. 16. f. 2): there are no other
perceptible differences of structure. The spots on the base of the caudal are more numerous,
but they are fewer and more scattered on the body than in the other figures, and there are

    In outline and the relative size and shape of the fins, this drawing has some resemblance
to the Arius pumilus of Jacquemont (Voy. dans I'lnde, pi. 18. f. 1), but it wants the casque and
the crutch-like interspinous process of that fish, there being merely a few black dots on the
nape, probably intended to represent some roughness of that part. There are no nasal barbels.
The maxillary ones reach beyond the head, and the submandibular ones are shorter. The
upper half of the dorsal spine is serrated in front and behind ; and the pectoral one only
behind. The anal i» small and rectangular. The adipose fin also rectangular, and of medium
size. The caudal acutely forked. The fish is drawn curved, and the lateral line, which is
marked by a silvery stripe, has a corresponding curvature, but is evidently quite straight when
the fish is in a true position. The back of the fish is bluish or greenish-gray, the other parts
being more or less brightly silvery. The fins have a similar tint to the back, and there is a

The profile of this fish, the form of the head and operculum, and the unusual distribution of

the dark patches of colour, remind one of the Pimelodus bagarius of Buchanan Hamilton, but

it wants the prolongations of the dorsal, pectorals and caudal, which characterise that species,

and also the enlargement of the maxillary barbels. It has likewise much resemblance to the

P. viridescens of the same author, of which fig. 157, Hardw. Malac. is a coloured representa-

tion. In pi. 11. f. 5G (Fishes of the Ganges), the engraving has been less accurately executed

than in the rest of Buchanan Hamilton's plates, and the three green bars which cross the back

are not distinctly shown. In fidvi-draco the maxillary barbels are a little longer than the

head, while the nasal one is only half that length, being about equal to the four submandi-

bular ones. The dorsal and pectoral spines are both stout, the latter being serrated on both

sides, the former only behind. The caudal is forked with thickish lobes. There are two

colours in the body, viz. olive-green and sienna-yellow, each forming three vertical bands

with a connecting longitudinal stripe low on the sides. Of these the olive-green occupies the

Agreatest space.  dark dingy green stripe runs through each caudi\l lobe, the rest of the fin

being yellowish-brown. The dorsal is also yellowish-brown and the anal a rather lighter

yellow, but with a broad green bar in its middle, descending from the horizontal ventral stripe

of that colour. The pectorals and ventrals are dark with pale rays. The prevailing tints on

   As we know the bulk of the Chinese species of this difficult family chiefly
from Mr, Reeves's drawings, the Cuvierian generic groups seem to be better
adapted for their description than the minuter subdivisions of more recent
ichthyologists, depending as many of them do on anatomical characters. I
have compared these drawings carefully with General Hardwicke's numerous

figures of Indian CyprinidcB*, and also with the plates of M'Clelland's paper

in the 19th volume of the Asiatic Researches for 1839, and am satisfied

that the Chinese species are almost wholly different from those of the pe-
ninsula of India. Mrs. Bowdich (now Lee) copied for Baron Cuvier many

drawings of Chinese fish, some of which are referred to by M. Valenciennes

in the sixteenth and seventeenth volumes of the ' Histoire des Poissons' which

treat of the CyprinidcB. Mr. Brown kindly pointed out to me the drawings
she traced from in the Banksian Library. They are kept loose in a port-

folio, and are entitled in the Catalogue ' Icones piscium 24? a pictore Sinensi
Cantoni eleganter pictoe, fol.' Aided by the dimensions of the tracings noted

by M. Valenciennes, and his descriptions of the colours, I have been able to
identify most of these drawings with the species named by him ; but as he

quotes more of Mrs. Bowdich's tracings of CyprinidcB than there are origi-
nals in this small collection, it is evident that she made copies also of the
figures in some other Chinese book or collection of drawings ; and M. Va-
lenciennes also mentions several figures of Cyprinidce which he saw in the

Banksian Library, but which I have not been able to find.

 and also of the anal is strongly serrated posteriorly almost to the base. The barbels at the
 angle of the mouth are about equal to the rictus in length, and those which spring from the
 middle of the maxillary are not much shorter, in which respect the drawing differs from that of
 nigro-nuraius of Lacepede. Seventeen soft rays are shown in the dorsal and six in the anal,

 the three under fins have ochraeeous rays. The lateral line is slightly deflexed, equidistant
 from back and belly, and is composed of about twenty-eight scales.

    It is with the doubt which pervades all such approximations that we refer Mr. Reeves's
 drawing, above-quoted, to the species noticed by Lacepede. In general form it approaches that
 of Reeves, 116 (atro-virens), but the outline of the back is rather less flat, and slopes mo-
 derately each way to an apex at the beginning of the dorsal. The height is contained thrice
 and one-sixth in the total length, of which the head makes a fourth. The rays shown by the
 artist are D. 2|20 ; A. 2|5 ; the strong spines being deeply serrated, and the last soft rays di-
 vided to the base. The dorsal commences over the tip of the pectorals and front of the ven-
 trals, and terminates a little farther from the caudal than the anal does. The lateral line is
 straight, and is composed of twenty-eight or thirty scales. The scales generally are brightly
 silvery with olive-green bases, which deepen on the back to blackish-green, and fade lower
 on the sides to apple-green and oil-green. There is a slight reddish blush on the shoulder,
and an ochraeeous tint on the breast and lower parts of the head. The operculum is streaked
on its upper anterior half. The dorsal is pale ash-gray, with a row in the middle of darker
pearl-gray blotches between the rays. The ventrals and anal are also pale with bright red
tips, and the caudal is bordered at the end with red, the body of the fin being dark yellowish-
gray. The pectoral is blackish-gray.

    This drawing represents a fish with the same profile as the preceding one (Reeves, 117),
the only differences being a trifling increase in the length of the head, and the dorsal com-
mencing a very little farther back. The barbels are the same, and both this and the two
preceding species have a conspicuous, elevated, scoop -shaped border to the posterior nasal
orifice. The rays shown in the figure are D. 2|18 cr 19 ; A. 2|5. It is possible that this may
be merely the rubro-fuscus in its spawning dress. The lateral line is very slightly decurved,
and is traced on thirty-one scales. The operculum is striated almost to the edge. The bases
of the scales down to a row or two below the lateral line are duck-green, so defined as to pro-
duce rows of rectangular spots. The discs of the upper scales and the upper parts of the head
have bronze reflexions ; the lateral ones are silvery with a reddish blush, and the whole under
parts of the head and body are bright orpiment-orange, the colours being most intense on the
circumference of the scales. The ventrals and anal are also orange ; the pectorals and caudal
lake-red, and the dorsal pale chestnut-brown.

   Mr. Reeves has deposited two specimens in the British Museum, which we refer to his figure,

and also, though with less confidence, to Lacep^de's viridi-violaceus. In profile it differs a
little from the preceding species, in the curve of the back passing insensibly into the tail, and

 in the facial line not being so suddenly depressed at its union with tije nape, wiiich is never-
 theless gibbous. The height of the body is equal to a third of the total length, of which the
 head forms one-fourth; excluding the caudal, the head is equal to a third of the length ; the
 thickness amounts to nearly half the height. The barbel which issues from near the middle
 of the maxillary is very small ; that which springs from near its tip is moderately large. The
 straight or very slightly decurved lateral line is traced on thirty-three scales, and there are
 ten rows of scales in the height of the body. Their discs are obscurely radiated and roughish.

 No streaks appear on the gill-cover. The dorsal commences some way before the ventrals

 and over the posterior third of the pectorals ; its third soft ray stands above the front of the
 ventrals. Its large spine and that of the anal are strongly serrated, and the last soft ray of the
 two fins is divided to the base.

    The general hue of this fish is fully darker than any other one of Mr. Reeves's drawings of
 the genus, the bases and edges of the scales being blackish-green passing into greenish-black,
 with bronze discs above the lateral line, the light and dark parts being arranged so as to
produce lines corresponding in number with the rows of the scales. The dark bases are con-
tinued over the belly, but restricted in size; and the discs of the scales below the lateral line
are pale olive-green with very slightly deeper coloured edges. Some crimson and lake tints
exist on the belly and under surface of the tail. The top of the head is blackish-green, the
cheeks and opercula are rich, dark auricula-purple, bordered by brilliant bronze. Under
parts of the head and throat buff-orange. Dorsal ash-gray with a yellowish-gray base. The
ventrals and anal are pale with rosaceous tips ; the pectorals show faint yellow, purple and
red tints, and the dark clove-brown caudal has the ends of the lobes hyacinth-red. Lengths
of the specimens 6 and 8J inches: of the figure 10^ inches.

   This has much the form of viridi-violaceus, but is more elegantly shaped at the nape, which
is not so gibbous. The barbels are longer and the fins are all very tall, seemingly the effect

of monstrous growth. A small specimen apparently of this species, but with a triple caudal,

was brought from China by Captain Dawkins. Only one spine, the tall serrated one, is re-
presented by the artist in the dorsal and anal, whose rays are Dl|19 ; A. 1|6 or 7. The colour
of the back down to the straight lateral line is the same as in viridi-violaceus, but the purple
tints are replaced on the side of the head by a shining bronze colour. The sides and belly
are silvery, with a greenish-gray shade at the bases of the scales. Dorsal and caudal brownish-
red, fading to purplish-red towards the edges ; anal and pectorals blood-red, the spine of the
former and rays of the latter being light purplish-gray. Anterior half of the ventrals blackish-
purple, the posterior half peach-blossom red.

    This species has an elevated back, shaped in profile like the roof of a house, with the sum-
mit at the commencement of the dorsal, which is over the posterior third of the small pectoral
and some way before the ventrals. The posterior slope of the back is the more gradual one,
and is entirely occupied by the dorsal. The belly is horizontal, with a short upward slope to
the tail which is occupied by the anal. Head small, forming one-fifth of the length of the fish,
while the height of the body equals a third of the same length. The nostrils want the valve or
erect lip shown in the drawings of the preceding species, and there is a deep groove across the
snout a short way before them, and on a line with the front of the preorbitar. The tip of the
snout is tumid, though not large. The barbels are small, particularly the uppor pair. The
rays shown in the drawing are D. 2|19; A. 2|5. The spines are strong and coarsely serrated,

particularly the anal one.

   Top of the head and bases of the scales of the back oil green. More and more of the discs
of the scales become silvery as they approach the lateral line ; and they are wholly so lower
down, except that a very pale wax-yellow colour marks their bases on the belly. The cheek
is bluish-gray ; the fins are all more or less tinged with aurora-red, with pale borders. The
red is deepest on the caudal, but that fin also has a broad colourless border at the end. The

lips are reddish, and the eye, which is large, has a red iris.

   If one may judge from the size of the figure, this is the largest true carp that came under
Mr. Reeves's observation. Its profile rises very considerably in a bold arch to the dorsal, with
a shallow transverse groove before the nostrils and a slight undulation at the nape. The
belly is flattish. The height of the body is contained thrice in the total length, and the length
of the head four times and a half. The mouth is rather oblique, and the upper jaw goes
beyond and somewhat overhangs the lower one. The upper barbels are short*. The lateral
line, which is traced on thirty-one scales, is slightly decurved, and descends a little below the

middle height, taking a straight course through the middle of the tail after passing Ithe ven-

trals. No streaks are shown on the gill-covers. The long, low dorsal commences behind
the tip of the pectorals and before the ventrals, and reaches past the middle of the anal. The
pectorals and ventrals are small and rounded. The rays shown in the figure are D. 1|21 ;
A. 2|5. The dorsal spine is serrated ; but the anal one, which is longer and stronger, is re-
presented as smooth. The colours are not dark, the scales having much silvery lustre : they

are shaded at the base with olive-green on the back, and with pale honey-yellow on the lower

parts.

    M. Valenciennes mentions that he saw two paintings of this species in the library of Sir
Joseph Banks, but I have been able to discover only one of these, and it is the only true Cy~
prinus with barbels contained in the collection named '' Icones I'iscium 24, &c.' The figure is
 10 inches long and 3^ inches high, and its pectoral fin has been omitted. The name o^ nigro-
auratus is not characteristic either of this drawing or of Mr. Reeves's, which show much more
lively colours than M. Lacepede describes, as M. Valenciennes has remarked. But for the
observation of the latter naturalist, who has examined the Chinese drawings on which M. La-
cepede's species are founded, I should have been inclined to quote Mr. Reeves's darkest draw-

 ing, our atro-virens, as corresponding best with the epithet nigro-auratus.

This species differs from the preceding ones in form, the dorsal being more flatly arched

and the belly more prominent, with a considerable upward slope behind to join the trunk of

the tail. The height of the body is contained thrice and one-half, and the length of the head

four times and a quarter in the whole length. The lateral line, which is considerably de-

curved, but does not descend beyond the middle height, is traced on twenty-nine scales. The

barbels are rather short. The dorsal commences over the first ventral ray, and the greater

part of the anal is posterior to its termination. The rays shown in the figure are D. 2|l7 or

The scales have much silvery lustre, and are almost wholly nacry below the lateral line ;

but the back is tinted with leek-green, which deepens into blackish-green at the base of the

scales and forms spots. The edges of the upper scales are also darker leek-green, and the

top of the head is of the same colour. There are carmine tints on the lips and tips of the anal

and caudal. The pectoral, dorsal and caudal, are leek-green, the ventrals and anal very pale

ochre.

   Obs. The seven species noticed above seem all to be true Cyprini, allied
to the common carp of Europe ; and their existence in the Chinese waters
shows a marked difference between the ichthyology of that country and of
India, which does not appear to possess any member of this group. The
Cyprinus semiplotus of M'Clelland is indeed introduced among the true carps
with barbels in the ' Histoire des Poissons' ; but this would appear to be from
inadvertence, as the figure in the 'Asiatic Researches* (19. pi. 37. f. 2), and

This fish has two moderate-sized barbels issuing from behind the middle of the lip and none

from the corner of the mouth, and on that account I should have placed it in the genus Ro-

hita of M. Valenciennes, which had previously received the appellation of Nandina from Mr.

Gray, both authors deriving their generic name from one of Buchanan Hamilton's species.

Mr. Reeves's drawing, however, does not indicate that development of the upper lip, nor

the fringes that characterise Rohita ; and it is probably on this account that Mr. Gray, in the

analysis that he had commenced of these drawings, bestowed on this one another generic

epithet as above quoted. In the uncertainty which exists respecting the true characters of

this species, I have preferred noticing it under the general appellation of Cyprinus. In the

extent of the dorsal it resembles the Cyprinus nandina of Buchanan Hamilton, or the

Cirrhinus nacronotus of M'Clelland, but it differs much from that fish in its profile. The back

forms a very flat elliptical curve, and there is a considerable gibbous descent at the shoulder

to meet the facial line, which would he a straight slope, were it not that a slight rising

of the thin snout gives it a small degree of concavity. I'he mouth is terminal, and the lower

jaw is very little shorter than the upper one. The head is exactly a fourth of the length of

the fish, and the height of the body somewhat exceeds a third of the length. The eye is

rather small, and is equidistant from the mouth and gill-opening. The nostrils are not drawn

with an elevated border. The lateral line is considerably decurved, descending over the ven-

trals below the middle height, but running through the middle of the tail. It is traced on

Aonly twenty-five scales.  few short streaks radiate from the anterior superior corner of the

operculum. The dorsal, which is highest anteriorly and has a straight edge, begins before

the ventrals, over the last fifth of the pectorals, and approaches almost as near to the cau-

dal as the anal does. Its first two rays are drawn as stout and spinous, standing up stiffly

from the others : they are not denticulated. The anterior anal rays are nearly similar. The

numbers shown by the artist are D. 2|20 ; A. 2|5, &c. The scales are mostly silvery, with a
pale mountain-green tint towards the base of each. This tint covers more of the disc towards

the back, and most of the upper scales are also edged with the same. There is a crimson tint

on the top of the head, and a faint blush of the same runs along the side above the lateral

line. The lips are carmine, and the pectorals, anal and caudal, are carmine at the base,

mixed with buff towards their borders, the extreme edge of the caudal being mountain-green.

The dorsal is celandine-green with carmine rays, and the ventrals bluish-gray, also with car-

mine rays.

the ' Fauna Japonica.' It may possibly be the same with the preceding, which it resembles in

outline, but it has fewer dorsal rays. There are thirty-one scales bearing tubes on the lateral
line, and twelve rows in the height of the fish. It seems to have been a paler fish than the

    As M. Valenciennes compares C. langsdorfii to gibelio, it is possible that Dr. Cantor's fish
may be the same. Several of Dr. Cantor's specimens have reached the British Museum
through the India House, one of them labelled C. nigrescens, which was probably merely a
provisional name, and changed when Dr. Cantor drew up his paper. In form the fish is re-
gular and rather elegant. Its face is convex, and the shoulder ascends in a gentle arch to the
dorsal. The head makes rather less than a fourth part of the length of the whole fish ; the
height of the body is contained three times and a quarter in the length, and the thickness rather
more than seven times, or twice and one-third in the height. The mouth is small, not being
cleft as far as the nostrils. The symphysis of the lower jaw rises in the form of a minute obtuse
point. The lateral line is straight or very slightly decurved, and is traced on twenty-seven
scales. There are thirteen rows of scales in the height : each scale is marked on the disc by
streaks radiating from the centre. The dorsal commences over the ventrals and extends back
 to the middle of the short anal. It has four spines, of which the two anterior ones are very
minute: the fourth one is strongly tootlied behind, and its flexible tip is also toothed. The
same is the case with the third anal spinef". The posterior pair of soft rays in both fins are
approximated at the base. The colour on the back is greenish-gray, deepening at the base of
 the scales to blackish-gray, becoming lighter inferiorly and changing to an ochraceous tint on
the breast. The fins are greenish or blackish-gray, of different degrees of intensity, and their
edges when folded are blackish. The pectoral and anal fins are red on their fore-edges. The
figure is 7^ inches long; the smallest specimen only 2^ inches.

    This is much like gibelioides, and may prove to be the same, in which case Dr. Cantor's
name has the priority. It seems rather more slender, and has a shorter and more delicate

 pectoral.

 this species, if they are not referable to the gibelioides of Cantor. They have the lobes of the
 caudal and the sinus between them much more obtuse than those of gibelioides, or of Reeves's
 figure 123, and apparently the large suborbitar of langsdorfii. Their lengths are 6 inches,

    This species has a short, high body, with a peculiarly short trunk of the tail. The length
 of the head is contained four times and a sixth in the total length, and the height of the body
 twice and a half. The profile of the back is very slightly arched, so that it is almost parallel
 to the straight belly, and the descent to the mouth is mostly from the nape and is pretty steep.
 There is also a considerable ascent from the breast to the mouth, «hich is terminal, but with
the lower jaw a little longer than the upper one. A small conical eminence is represented on
 the snout immediately before the nostrils. The eye is rather small and is about twice as far
 from the gill-opening as from the tip of the snout. The cheek appears from the drawing to
 be covered by the preorbitar, like that of ihoracatus, and the whole surface of the operculum
 is streaked. The lateral line is perfectly straight and is traced on twenty-three scales only.
 The dorsal commences over the front of the ventrals and approaches as near to the caudal as
 the anal does. The latter fin has the same direction with the caudal, being attached to a ver-
tical inflection of the under profile. The spines of the dorsal and anal are shorter than the
soft rays. The figure shows D. 2|1S ; A. 2(5, &c.

    The scales are silvery witli bluish- or blackish-gray bases, deeper towards the back, but
very pale towards the belly. The top of the head is dark greenish-gray, and the shoulders
brownish. The edges of the gill-pieces and the throat are straw-yellow. The fins are green-
ish-gray with a slightly brownish tinge on the lower part of the dorsal.

    Figure 121 Reeves appears to be the fish in its natural or uncultivated state. Its colours
are pure hyacinth-red, with silvery borders to the scales and saffron-yellow edges to the gill-
pieces. The pectoral, dorsal and caudal are hyacinth-red with a pale bluish-gray border to
the latter. The scaly base of the pectoral is purple and lilac, the rays of the anal are yellow
and those of the ventral red. The most brilliant of the cultivated varieties represented in
Mr. Reeves's drawings are vermilion and arterial blood-red, picked off with bright gold-yel-
low. Others have the scales shaded with Berlin- and flax-flower-blue, and are marked with
large vermilion patches. One is wholly bronze-coloured, the colour being deepest along the
back. All the cultivated varieties have an elevated edge or valve between the nostrils, which
is not shown in figure 121, and also the triple caudal: one of them has a double anal;
three of them have dorsals but of different sizes, and four of them want the dorsals entirely.
One of them has very large eyes, and two or three of them eyes sustained on a telescopic
pedestal.

   Among the ' Icones Piscium 24 a pictore Sinensi,' &c., one figure measuring 8^ inches in

length and nearly 2 inches in height, and belonging to the group of Carassius, has no repre-
sentative in Mr. Reeves's portfolio. The dorsal and anal are acute, and the caudal very much
so ; the lateral line straight and a little below the mid-height, and traced on thirty-four scales.
Colour mountain-green, with metallic lustre on the back, replaced below the middle of the
sides by a silvery tint. Upper fins coloured like the back, lower ones pale. M. Valenciennes,
at p. 101 of the 16th volume of the ' Histoire des Poissons,' mentions two drawings in the
Banksian library, one of which may be the figure here noticed, and the other perhaps one of
the three paintings which we have alluded to above under the head of Cyprinus langsdorfii.

    This species is partly rhomboidal in form, the very strong, round and slightly curved dor-
sal spine crowning the superior angle. The slope is straight from thence to near the base of
the caudal, but anteriorly it is moderately convex to the nape, where the depression or hori-
zontality of the facial line gives a considerable concavity to the profile. The posterior under-
side of the rhomb is shorter than the upper one and is wholly occupied by the anal. The
under angle of the rhomb is wanting, the belly being straight from the anus to the pectoral,
where the outline again ascends. The height to the apex of the rhomb is equal to nearly a
third of the whole length of the fish. The very obtuse lower jaw is a little shorter than the
thickish upper one, yet the mouth is terminal. Eye large, a little above mid-height and much
nearer to the end of the snout than to the gill-opening. The triangular dorsal commences
behind the ventrals and ends opposite to the anus. Its height is equal to half that of the body
and much exceeds that of its base. The rays shown in the drawing are D. 2|6, the strong
second spine being a little shorter than the adjoining branched ray, and the last ray divided
 to the base. A. 1|29 : the spine strong. Caudal deeply forked. Lateral line traced on forty-
 one scales, decidedly below the middle height and very slightly decurved. Scales large, very
 silvery, and on the back faintly oil-green with a well-defined rectangular or crescentic olive
 or blackish-green spot on the base of each. From the lateral line downwards these spots are
 replaced by light pearl-gray shadings. The temples and edges of the gill-plates are buff and
 saffron-yellow ; the top of the head hair-brown ; and the end of the nose and centre of the
 operculum bluish- or greenish-gray. Upper half of the operculum reddish-brown ; lower half
 pale yellow. Dorsal clove-brown with a broad bluish-gray border. Anal greenish-gray at
 the base and bluish-gray on the border. Caudal blackish-gray with a crimson base. Ventrals

 pale with bluish-gray rays.

    This fish has the rhomboidal form of the preceding species; but the profile of the very small

snout acute ; mouth small. Lips thin, but drawn as if both upper and under one were double.

The scales appear to be very delicate andnacry ; about fifty-eight are represented as forming the

lateral line, which is conspicuously decurved from the middle of the pectoral to the middle of
the anal. The scales are shaded with greenish-gray on the back and are pearly on the sides

without spots, the resulting general tint being pale. Opercular pieces and eye bordered with

oil-green, and there are some reddish tints on the snout and round the gill-opening. The

fins yellowish-gray and greenish-gray.

   A specimen was presented by Mr. Reeves to the British Museum. Having omitted to de-

scribe the colouring in the ' Ichthyology of the Sulphur,' I may here state that in Mr. Reeves's
drawing the top of the head is represented of a deep olive-green colour, and that a fainter
tint of the same extends along the back, but is glossed with much brassy lustre. Immediately

above the lateral line there is a dilute tinge of crimson, and all the under parts are peavl-gray
and brightly silvery. The cheeks are silvery. The under lip deep rose-red, and the gill-
cover and membrane are wrashed with the same. The rays of all the fins are more or less
brightly crimson, and the membranes, which vary from dark greenish-gray to blackish-gray,
are glossed with crimson on the under fins. This tint is richest on the pectorals, and there
are also orange colours between the rays of these fins.

    Since this fish was figured and described in the ' Ichthyology of the Voyage of the Sulphur'
under the specific name given to it by Mr. Gray, I have ascertained by consulting the ' Icones
PJscium 24 a pictore Sinensi Cantoni eleganter pictae,' that it is the L. molitrix of M. Valen-
ciennes. The drawing in the work just quoted measures 11 inches.

   Mr. Reeves has deposited a specimen of this fish also in the British Museum. The brassy

hue of the scales of this and the preceding species draws attention to the names cupreus and
aneus given by M. Valenciennes to two Chinese Leucisci, but the few particulars of form
which he has recorded do not correspond, and had the drawings he comments upon repre-
sented either hypophthalmus or nobilis, he could not have failed to remark the unusual de-
pression of the eyes into the curve of the preoperculum. In fact both extremities of the sub-
orbitar chain rise above the level of the eye, as they do also, though in a less degree, in L.
jesella and some other species.

     This fish is remarkable for the face being inclined upwards by a sudden curvature over the
 temples like the profile of a pug-dog. The nape rises in a short arc, but the dorsal line is
 only slightly convex, while the belly is considerably more curved, and the tail behind the anal
 is slender. The head, excluding the lower jaw, is one-fifth of the length of the fish ; and the
 height of the body is a little more. The drawing represents a convex keel between the ven-
 trals and anus. The cleft of the mouth is vertical, with a curve towards its angle ; and the
 lower jaw, which forms the anterior end of the head, is dilated and apparently naked, like
 that oi Aspius mento and maxillaris. The large eye is equal in diameter to a fourth part of
 the length of the head, and is situated one diameter behind the mouth. The lateral line is
 decurved at its commencement, and makes a sudden short bend downwards under the dorsal,
 after which it ascends very gently in a straight line till it has passed some way beyond the

being about sixty-eight rows represented between the gill-opening and caudal. Dorsal having
a height in front of twice the length of its base, acute and placed over the middle space be-
tween the ventrals and anal. Its second ray is represented as strong, round and curved like
that of a Rhodiits, and the first one as slender, but only a third part shorter. Anus behind

    This drawing has all the characters recorded by M. Valenciennes of molitorella, except that
the caudal has longer and more pointed lobes than other Leucisci represented in Mr. Reeves's
drawings, while this fin is said in the molitorella to have the lobes rounded and little length-
ened. I have not however thought it advisable to keep it distinct merely because of this dis-
crepancy. In the drawing the snout projects beyond the mouth, which is small, with the
lower jaw shutting close up. Its dorsal is large, triangular, and as high in front as the body,
with a base nearly as long as its height. The ventrals are attached beneath its middle. The
anal is nearer to the caudal than to the ventrals. The rays are D. 12 or 13 ; A, 7.

    The summit of the back is olive-green, with a quadrangular spot at the base of each scale
of dark duck-green approaching to blackish-green. These spots disappear above the lateral
line, which is nearly straight, and give place to a pale shading of bluish-green, which is re-
placed on the belly by cream-yellow, the discs of the scales being mostly silvery. About
twelve of the scales immediately above the pectoral fin are bordered with china-blue, their
discs remaining silvery, and thus producing a reticulated rhomboidal spot. The dorsal, ventrals ·
and anal are very pale mountain-green and transparent ; the first being oil-green at the base,
and the two latter tipped with peach-blossom red. The caudal has greenish rays and roseate
tints with a bluish-gray edge ; and the rays of the pectoral are also greenish with a faintly
roseate membrane. The sides of the head are silvery, shaded with green and glossed by some
rose-coloured and lilac tints.

    L. fintella is represented as being thrice as long as it is high ; but in the figure of hemi-
stictus the height is contained four times and a half in the length, and the head five times. It
has a general resemblance to the Barilius goha of Buchanan Hamilton, p. 385 (Hardw. Malac.
36 and 53 ; Opsarius gracilis, M'Clelland, 47. f. 1), but it wants the spots on the head, and
the dots on the body are blacker and more regular. The profile of hemistictus is symmetrically
fusiform. The head is a slender cone with a bluntish apex ; and the lower jaw, which is
shorter than the upper one, is represented as shutting as it were partly within it. The dorsal
commences a little before the ventrals, which are attached in the middle of the length, caudal

excluded, and the vent terminates the third quarter of the same distance. No streaks on the
gill-cover. Scales large, smooth and nacry, thirty-eight in a longitudinal row and eight or
nine in height. The lateral line is evenly decurved and runs beneath mid-height till it passes

   The shading of the drawing seems to indicate that the belly of this fish is acute from the
middle of the pectorals to the anus. Its back is very flatly arched, the nearly horizontal face
forming part of the curve, which is much inferior in convexity to the belly. The height of
the body is about equal to the seventh of the length, of vchich the head forms less than an
eighth part. The scales seem to be small and delicate, and the lateral line descends at its
commencement in a short arc to the lower quarter of the height, and then runs horizontally
from the last quarter of the anus, where it rises parallel to the curve of the attachment of the
anal fin, and again resumes its horizontal direction when it has reached the middle of the tail.
The dorsal commences a little behind the front of the ventrals or in the middle of the length,
caudal excluded. It is taller than the anal, and equals it in the length of its base. The
caudal is forked.

   The very silvery scales are shaded at the bases with leek-green on the back and light pearl-
gray on the belly. The fins are pale mountain-green, transparent and without spots, except
the pectoral, which is asparagus-green with a blackish spot on its inferior angle, near the base.
There are some greenish-yellow shadings on the head.

 and there are nine rows of scales in the height of the body, of which five are above the lateral
 line. The dorsal commences a little before the middle of the length, caudal excluded, and
 its height, which is equal to two-thirds of the height of the body, measures almost twice the
 length of its base. The last ray being comparatively longer and the corners of the fin rounded,
it has not the triangular form of the dorsal of many of the other Leucisci. The front of
 the ventrals is under the middle of the dorsal, and the anal is midway between them and the

 caudal.

    The large discs of the scales, down to a row beneath the lateral line, have an uniform oil-
green tint with much lustre, and are surrounded by a defined border of deep duck-green, pro-
 ducing hexagonal reticulations. Lower down, the discs of the scales are silvery, and the
 meshes that enclose them pass into ochre- and cream-yellows. The base of the pectoral and
 scales before that fin have a red-lilac tint, and the head corresponds in colour with the body,
 being green above and ochraceous or cream-coloured below. There is a little blue around
the eye and on the upper corner of the operculum. The pectorals are green, with a brownish
 gloss ; the ventrals buff'-coloured, and the other fins dark greenish-gray, the rays of the caudal
 being dark green. In the figure belonging to the collection in the Banksian library quoted
by M. Valenciennes, the bases of the scales are darker than the borders, but the drawings are
 otherwise so mucli alike as to occasion little doubt of their being representatives of the same

 species.

   Chinese name, Hih hwan, " Black hwan fish" (Birch); Hih ivan, " Black
          " (Reeves); Hak wan (Bridgem. Chrest. 233). Length of the

    figure 15^ inches. Height of body 3 inches. Length of head 3^ inches.

    This fish is elongated like idella, but is rather less symmetrical, has even a thicker tail,
more obtusely-forked caudal, and more unevenness in the profile of the head and shoulders.
The mouth is similarly formed, the eye in the same position, and the fins similar in place and
form. The scales are smaller but appear to be equally strong, and the lateral line as distinctly
marked by an elevated straight tube on each scale. It runs very nearly straight, or with a
slight general decurvature along the middle of the fish. The fins are taller than those of
jesella, the dorsal being equal in height to the body, and the anal not very much lower. All
the fins are obtuse. The operculum and supra-scapulars are furrowed.

    General colour pitchy or blackish-brown, deepest on the back, and gradually changing on
the belly to bluish-gray. The scales are not enclosed in a dark mesh-work like those of
jesella, but are darkest on the fore-edge, and grow gradually paler towards their bases. Head
 blackish-gray above, beneath white. There is a greenish tint on the breast and a tinge of
crimson along the edge of the belly. All the fins are blackish-gray, deepening to black to-
wards the edges, and their rays are whitish at the base. There are forty-three scales on the
lateral line, and ten or eleven rows in height. The rays shown are D. 9 ; A. 10, &c.

    This figure represents a fish with an elevated back rising to a point at the beginning of the
dorsal. The anterior slope is varied by a moderate gibbosity of the nape, but the posterior
one runs in a perfectly straight, obliquely-descending line to the caudal fin. Belly most pro-
minent under the middle of the pectorals, sloping suddenly up to the throat and very gradually
to the caudal. Head small. Eye large and low in the cheek. Snout full and apparently
fleshy, projecting beyond the lower jaw, which shuts up beneath it. Pectorals small, acute.
The dorsal commences in the middle of the distance between the top of the snout and base of
the caudal, and its second ray is represented as stout, round, and acute, like that of a Rhodeus,
the third one being also simple, but more slender and shorter. D. 3|6, last divided to base

deeply forlied with thickish lobes. The lateral line is a little decurved over the pectoral, and
then takes a straight course below the middle of the height to the caudal. It is traced on
about forty-eight scales, which are consequently rather small, fourteen or fifteen rows are re-

presented in the height.

   The colour of the back is pure oil-green, the silvery borders of the scales increasing in
breadth on the flanks, the green is confined to a slight tinge on the base of each, and on the
belly it is replaced by pearl-gray. Caudal saffron -yellow with a bluish-gray border. The
top of the head is coloured like the back, the snout and under jaw are crimson, the temples
mountain-green, and the operculum purple. The dorsal is pale buff with the third ray crimson,
and there are crimson tints on the bases of the inferior fins ; the front of the anal being yel-
lowish-green. All the inferior fins appear to be transparent.

  A specimen was presented to the British Museum by John Reeves, Esq. which measures

seventeen inches in length. Not having seen Mr. Reeves's drawing of this species until after
the publication of the ' Ichthyology of the Voyage of the Sulphur,' the colours of the recent fish
were not therein described. They are pale chestnut-brown on the back with silvery discs to
the scales, and a gradual passage into greenish-gi-ay on the belly. The jaws, pectorals, lower
fins, and under lobe of the caudal are ochre-yellow ; the upper lobe of the caudal the same,
with a greenish tinge, and the dorsal greenish-blue. There are also some blushes of carmine
at the bases of the ventrals and caudal. This Leuciscus is remarkable for the size and soli-
dity of the intermaxillaries, and for the conical process which rises from the symphysis of the
lower jaw, as well as for its slender form.

    This fish has an elegant, symmetrical fusiform shape, the back rather less arched than the
belly, the face nearly straight, and a very slight gibbosity at the nape. The head is slenderly
conical with an obtuse snout, projecting a little beyond the lower jaw. The eye is nearly in the
centre, between the tip of the snout and the gill-opening, and the nostrils are considerably
before it. Dorsal rounded, commencing opposite the front of the ventrals. Anal short, mo-
derately high. Caudal forked. Lateral line equally decurved to near the caudal, descending
a little below the middle opposite to the ventrals, and traced on about thirty-five scales. There
are nine rows in the height. D. 9 ; A. 9 or 10, &c.

   In this drawing only four barbels are shown, and the ventrals are a little farther forward
than in anguillicaudatus. The general colour of the body is umber-brown, pretty dark on the

back, but paler and with silvery lustre on the sides. The fins are also brown. A considerable
number of oblong or roundish black spots are pretty equally scattered over the whole body,

and there are more crowded round ones on all the fins except the ventrals.

   The British Museum possesses a Canton specimen of this fish, presented by Mr. Reeves,
and there are many in the museum of the College of Surgeons, which were sent from Woosung
by Capt. Sir Everard Home, Bart., R.N. Mr. Reeves mentions that this is the species which
is exported from Bombay in a dried state, and sold in London under the name of " Bombay

ducks." In Mr. Reeves's drawing, a long spinous-looking prolongation of the suboperculum

is shown, which seems to have originated in some mistake of the artist, as there is no trace
of it in the specimen. The skin is naked, except the lateral line, which is protected by mo-
derately-sized tiled scales, which are more crowded posteriorly and run out on the caudal,
forming a middle point or lobe which is shorter than the side. The largest specimen we have
examined is eleven inches long.

   This drawing resembles Salmo fastens, BI. 384. f. 2, more than any other Saurus of which
we have seen a figure. It has the same very short obtuse snout, short pectorals, forward ven-
trals and long anal, but S.fcetens has an unspotted body and is an inhabitant of the Atlantic.

Lacepfede's figure of lemniscatus is rude, but his description of the patterns of the markings
answers exactly to Mr. Reeves's drawing, though the colours are not the same. His plate and
his description are both founded upon a drawing on vellum by Plumier, and it is very pro-

bable that in the lapse of time the colours may have undergone considerable change, assu-
ming that they were perfectly correct in the first instance.

    In Mr. Reeves's drawing, the ground-colour on the top of the back is lemon-yellow, which
is thickly speckled with irregular spots of brownish-red and umber-brown ; on the sides the
yellow forms about four longitudinal stripes, alternating with purplish-red ones, the latter
becoming broader and changing to crimson on the belly. The head is mostly of the purplish-
red tint, and there is a black spot on the supra-scapular. The dorsal, ventrals and anal are
transparent and faintly crimson, with one yellow bar on the ventrals and two or three on the
dorsal. The dorsal is yellowish at the base and blackish-gray on its posterior border. The
cheeks and body are scaly, but no scales are shown on the gill-cover.

cardiform ; those on the tongue are very strong. The ground colour of the back is a mottled
mixture of greenish-gray and yellow, varied by fifteen or sixteen transverse bars composed of
small spots of umber-brown. These bars are irregular on the top of the back, but Ihey descend
below the lateral line, and are there more distinct, from the intervening spaces being gam-
boge-yellow. The belly is brightly silvery. The head is varied by many spots of umber-brown,
the jaivs being also much spotted. The caudal is pale orange-brown, with about nine trans-
verse bars thickly spotted with umber. The other fins are more or less deeply yellowish-brown
with five or si.x rows of darker spots on the rays, except the pectorals, which do not appear
to be spotted.

frequents the seas of Otaheite, has considerable resemblance to this species.

This, judging from the drawing, is a more elongated species than the preceding ones, the

height of the body scarcely exceeding a seventh of the total length. The eye is moderately

large, and is situated over the middle of the cleft of the mouth. The pectorals, which are not

large, reach just to the front" of the ventrals, and the dorsal commences over the axilla of the

latter fins. The caudal is forked as in the preceding two species, without any middle lobe.

The lateral line is strongly marked, and one of the most distinctive characters of the fish ap-

pears to be the strong contrast between the colours above and below the line, the upper parts

being a decided yellowish-brown, darker on the edges of the scales, producing reticulations, and

the lower parts bright silvery, the two tints being exactly defined by the lateral line, which is

darker than the other parts. The head is mostly coloured like the back. There are no spots

either on the body or fins, but the ends of the pectorals and the posterior edge of the caudal

are blackish.

Sir Edward Belcher's collection contains a Saurus which I should be inclined to refer to the

species represented by Mr. Reeves's drawing, but for the greater acuteness of the snout of the

specimen. They correspond in colours and position of the fins. In this specimen the height

of the body is inferior to its width, and is contained about eight times in the total length. The

back is rounded and depressed, and tlie thickness diminishes gradually from the dorsal fin to

the tip of the acute snout, and also in the other direction to the slender tail, which is round near

the base of the caudal fin. The jaws are equal. The cleft of the mouth exceeds half the di-

stance from tlie tip of the snout to the edge of the gill-cover. The centre of the eye is rather

behind the middle of the cleft, and the length of the head exceeds a fifth part of the whole
length, or more exactly forms a fourth part of the length, caudal excluded. The eyes encroach

on the profile and are about a diameter apart, the edges of the orbits being deficient or notched

above. The interorbital space is concave. The occiput ends in a serrated edge, which is

slightly concave posteriorly, and the supra-scapulars also show a projecting rough edge.

The fronts of the ventrals are attached exactly midway between the tip of the snout and the

vent. The tips of the pectoral reach just to their first ray, and the commencement of the

dorsal is a little behind the axilla of the ventrals.  The rays  are  B.  12-13                             D. 10 ;  A.  12

are also a number of lines parallel to it, produced by the transparency of the scales, permitting

the meeting of the edges of two rows to shine through the discs of the intervening incumbent

row. The teeth are slender with lanceolate tips, but none of them appear to be distinctly

barbed. In the upper jaw, the tall ones are inclined forwards and are ranged in a widely-set

series, with some shorter ones at the base. In the lower jaw there are several graduated rows

inclined inwards, the interior row being the tallest. The palatine teeth form card-like plates

which approach each other anteriorly in an acute angle, leaving a narrow smooth space on the

mesial line. The surface of the tongue is also armed by rows of teeth, but smaller than any
of the others we have mentioned. The edges of the branchial arches are rough, with much

more minute teeth, very dissimilar to the slender, curved and barbed teeth of the gills of

Harpodon.

Examples of this fish exist in the British Museum, where they were deposited by Mr.

Reeves and General Hardwicke, in the Chinese collection at Hyde Park, and in the Cam-

bridge Philosophical Institution, to which they were presented by the Rev. George Vachell.

As Osbeck's generic appellation was in his day generally applied to the Coregoni, it is pro-

bable that he did not consider this fish as presenting peculiar generic characters, and had no

intention of restricting the name of Albula to this species ; Mr. Gray's expressive one of Leu-

cosoma is therefore the proper generic appellation for this very peculiar form : besides, Bloch

after Osbeck gave the name of Albula to the genus Butirinus, and its re-introduction would

lead to confusion. It is the " white bait" of the foreign residents at Macao.

   Body elongated, roundish anteriorly ; compressed and higher at the dorsal, which is far back,
the compression increasing in the tail, which is again more slender. A furrow runs along the

top of the back to the front of the dorsal and reappears behind that fin. There is likewise a

furrow from the ventrals to the anus, and the very low posterior part of the anal stands also

in a furrow. The body is scaleless and transparent, so that the muscles, intestines and spinal

column can be seen without dissection. Head and jaws very much depressed, presenting a
mere edge in profile, but when viewed from above, showing a lanceolate outline much

like the bill of a Tyrannula. The head appears to be composed chiefly of thin, flexible and

Adiaphanous bone. fine short mesial ridge exists at the end of the snout, and farther back there

is a rhomboidal membranous space, which is perforated by three holes, through each of which

a tooth of the lower jaw protrudes when the mouth is closed. The velum of the upper jaw is

posterior to this membranous space. The eyes are lateral and encroach both on the upper
and under profiles of the head. Two minute nasal orifices are situated a short way before

each eye. The jaws are equal and the short cleft of the mouth is nearly horizontal, but with

a slight arching in the middle. The maxillary curves over the angle of the mouth, and send-

ing a fine slip in front of the end of the intermaxillary, forms a considerable part of the mar-

gin of the upper jaw. About four widely separated, subulate, recurved teeth arm the limb of

each intermaxillary; and between the foremost of these canines and the tipof the jaw there are

Aseveral much snjaller ones in a single series.       close pectinated row of short teeth edges the

maxillary ; and the lateral teeth of the lower jaw are also smaller and more numerous than
the upper ones; but in front, a little within the narrow, unarmed tip of the jaw, three strong

teeth stand in a triangle and pass through the holes above mentioned. The palatine bones

are finely toothed on the edge, but there are no teeth on the vomer, which is not at all pro-

minent. A row of strong recurved teeth runs along the middle of the pointed tongue. The

gill-cover is convex  and  curves in so as to  touch  its fellow  on  the  under surface of the head
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the opening is large and is partly seen on the upper surface of the head. The gill-membrane

unites with the isthmus about one-third nearer to the eye than to the tip of the gill-cover.

The ventrals are attached rather before the middle of the fish, the first dorsal considerably

farther back, and the adipose fin over the hinder part of the anal, which is wholly behind the

dorsal. The first stout ventral ray is jointed, but I can perceive no joints in the short anterior

ray of the dorsal and anal. The first two rays of the dorsal are graduated and incumbent on

the base of the third one, which is the tallest j the three anterior rays of the anal are also im-
bedded in the base of the fin*. The pectoral is obliquely truncated, and the caudal is acutely

notched at the end. On the base of the fin above and below there is a seam-like edge which

is supported by fourteen short rays. The gut appears to be a straight tube without convolu-

tions, but I did not ascertain the absence of pyloric cseca. Length 7^ inches.

    John Russell Reeves, Esq, presented a specimen of this fish to the British Museum. It is
 a short higli fish with a rounded back and a very acute belly, which is serrated by sixteen
 teeth before the ventrals and ten behind them. The height is contained thrice in the length
to the base of the caudal, or thrice and three-quarters when that fin is included. The curve
of the back is slight, that of the belly very considerable, and attaining its apex under the be-
ginning of the dorsal. The length of the head is one-fifth less than the height of the body.
The mouth is small and terminal, and the maxillary, which is oval and obtuse at the lower
end, reaches to beneath the middle of the eye ; near its articulating head, a portion of the
oval is deficient on the upper side only. There are no teeth on the jaws, but the lining of
the mouth and the oval disc of the tongue are studded with minute papillae. There are ten
rows of scales in the height of the body and forty in a row. The ventrals are under the fore-
third of the rather large dorsal, and all tlie fins are scaly. The scales of the back are bright
grass-green with silvery edges ; lower down they are more silvery with pale ultramarine blue
shadings. The fins are pale asparagus-green, with a yellow tint on the pectorals, and the
head is mostly silvery with green shadings, orange iris and gamboge edges to the gill-pieces.
There is a dark honey-yellow spot on the humeral bone.

   This fish has more resemblance to the Kowal or Koivarloo of Russell (186) than to any
other figure in his book, but he enumerates the dorsal rays as 18. They may however, on
a comparison of specimens, prove to be the same. It is not unlike Bloch's figure (pi. 405) of
Clupea sinensis, but there are no indications of the black bars on the dorsal and caudal in
Mr. Reeves's figure.

    The head forms a fourth of the length of the fish, caudal excluded, or rather more than a
fifth part including that fin. Both back and belly are acute, and the thickness of the body
equals half its height. The back rises in a very gentle curve from the snout to the dorsal,
and descends still more gently to the caudal. The curve of the belly is more convex from
the tip of the lower jaw to the front of the pectorals, but posteriorly it corresponds with that
of the back. The end of the under jaw forms the extremity of the head. Eye near the pro-
file. The disc of the maxillary is an oval approaching nearly to a circle, with a short, slender
articulating process : its lower end comes under the middle of the eye. The intermaxillary
forms the border of the upper jaw, the maxillary merely touching the corner of the small
orifice with its rounded shoulder. The centre of the dorsal is a little anterior to the middle
of the length, caudal excluded, and the ventrals are attached under the middle of the dorsal.
There are forty or forty-one Scales in a longitudinal row. The belly is strongly serrated be-
hind the ventrals, but before these fins the points of the keeled scales are more depressed.
The pointed scaly process over the pectoral equals the fin in length.

   Colour of the back light duck-green with silvery borders to the scales. The sides silvery
shaded by faint bluish-green. Head silvery with green shadings and some rich umber tints
on the hind-head and humeral bones. Fins asparagus-green with darkish edges to the
caudal. The pectorals are wood-brown.

    This fish agrees generally with the figure o( Clupanodon sinensis ot Lac6pSde (v. pi. II.

f. 2. pp. 468, 471), but does not correspond in the numbers of the fin-rays. It may neverthe-
less be the same ; but as the names of chinensis and sinensis have been too liberally applied

to Chinese fish, and to more than one species in this genus, confusion will be avoided by
dropping it in this instance, even were tlie identity of Mr. Reeves's specimen and Lac6p6de's
more clearly made out than we have been able to do. It is very unlike the Cltipea sinensis
ofBloch, 405.

    This drawing greatly resembles the preceding species in form, and it has even a better title
to the epithet of long-waisted. The dorsal curve is similar to that of nympliiea, but the ven-
tral one is more gradual anteriorly, its summit being thrown back to the middle of the dorsal.
The anal is longer and lower, and the pectoral reaches only one-third of the distance to the
ventrals. The rays shown by the artist are D. 17 ; A. 18 or 19. The scales are as large as

those of nymphaa, about forty-two being represented in a longitudinal row. No serratures
are shown on the belly.

   The upper parts are grass-green with a brownish gloss along the top of the back. The
sides are more completely silvery, but a little above the middle the scales are bordered by
China-blue producing a stripe, and the silvery parts lower down have a purplish reflexion and
some pale blue shadings on the bases of the scales. Some crimson tints occur on the sides of
the head. Caudal and ventrals asparagus-green. The other fins yellowish- or greenish-gray.

    This drawing represents a rather slender fish with the dorsal curve exceeding that of the
belly, and having a culminating point at the commencement of the dorsal. Ventrals far back
under the posterior part of the dorsal. Anal short, more than the length of its base distant
from the caudal, which is much forked with acute lobes. The skin is represented as nacry
without distinct scales, but with the fasciculi of the muscles, which meet in chevrons in the
middle height shining through. The rays shown by the artist are D. 11 ; A. 9.

   The back is shaded with leek-green ; the sides pearly with blue and crimson reflexions.
Head silvery with pale green shadings. Pectorals faintly crimsoned : other fins asparagus-
green and transparent. An umber-brown streak runs from the upper angle of the gill-open-
ing over the shoulder and disappears gradually under the commencement of the dorsal.

Mr. Reeves deposited a specimen in the British Museum which still retains the original

label numbered in reference to his drawing. It has considerable resemblance to the palasah

of Russell (198), or Icon. Hardw. Malac. 214,/^. indica, but the pectoral fin is shorter, the

coarseness of the scales on the caudal and the numbers of the fin-rays differ, and we therefore
keep them distinct. Russell states the rays of Alosa palasah to be D. 18 ; A. 20 ; V. 9, &c.

   In A. reevesii the eye is placed considerably below the temporal groove, and the maxillary,
which is slender at its head, swells out in the middle into a regular obtuse oval, and reaches

back to the binder edge of the orbit. Some branching veins exist on tlie shoulder, but none
are visible on the gill-cover. No teeth on the jaws or maxillary. The lateral line cannot be
made out. The scales are faintly streaked. Thirty of them compose a longitudinal row, and
there are thirteen rows over the veiitrals. Thirteen depressed teeth exist on the rim of the
belly before the ventrals, and there are fourteen more prominent ones behind these fins. The
front of the dorsal is midway between the end of the nose and the base of the caudal.

    The colour of the back is dark greenish- and blackish-gray, forming lines corresponding
in number with the rows of scales. Sides and belly very silvery with pearl-gray lines. Snout
and top of the head gray and dull crimson, with a greenish shade over the eye ; rest of the
head silvery with lilac reflexions. Pectorals cream-yellow, glossed in the upper border with
purplish-gray. The other fins clove-brown.

    This species has, like A. reevesii, much resemblance to Russell's figure 198, and as the fin-
 rays approach pretty nearly to those of the Indian fish in numbers, we have considered them
 to be the same, but not without doubt, because there is a difference in the size and form of the
 pectoral, besides other discrepancies. Mr. Reeves's Chinese specimen differs from A. reevesii
 in having a larger head with its profile running more evenly into that of the back, which is
 moreover acuminated at the beginning of the dorsal. The head forms a fourth part of the
 whole length of the fish j the height of the body is contained thrice and two-thirds in that
 length, and the thickness is equal to a third of the height. The back is acute, and the belly
 much more so, and strongly serrated between the ventrals and anus. The mesial ridge of
 the cranium commences between the nostrils, and after dilating a little, tapers off again and
 disappears without reaching the nape. The sides of the craniuin slope a little downwards
 from the mesial ridge. The shoulder is feebly veined, but the gill-covers are smooth.

     The maxillary having an oblong-oval form reaches back to the hinder edge of the orbit.
 The tongue is widely oval with a small keel on its tip, and the symphysis of the lower jaw
 also rises in a small point. No teeth on the jaws. Forty scales form a longitudinal row,
 and there are fifteen rows in height. The pectorals are rather larger than those of A. reevesii,
 and reach nearly to the ventrals, which are attached before the middle of the dorsal. The
 caudal is much forked.

     The scales are shaded by pale leek-green on the back, and by pearl-gray on the sides and
 belly. The snout and shoulder-plates are glossed viith red. The pectorals, ventrals and
 upper half of the dorsal are cream-yellow, the rays of the pectorals being buff-coloured. The
 lower parts of the dorsal, anal and caudal are ash-gray, the latter fin being tinted with car-
 mine at its base.

     Mr. Reeves mentions that this fish is very plentiful in its season, but is very bony ; and
 Russell makes a similar remark respecting the Indian fish, which is known at the tables of the
 English residents by the name of " sable-fish."

     In the 'Rdgne Animal' (ii. p. 319) Cuvier mentions that the jangarloo of Russell, 191,
 and his ditclioee, 192*, may be separated from the herrings on account of the position of the
 dorsal behind the ventrals and the length of the anal. Mr. Gray has given this group a name
 evidently taken from the specific appellation of one of Buchanan-Hamilton's Clupeee.

     Mr. Reeves deposited a dried and varnished specimen of Ilisha abnormis, numbered in
 reference to his drawing, in the British Museum. It is a more elongated fish than the^'«n-
 garloo, and consequently much more so than the ditchoee. Its profile slopes gently from the
 nostrils to the shoulder, which is a little gibbous, and then runs horizontally to the dorsal,
 whence it declines slightly to the caudal. The face has however a marked degree of conca-
 vity caused by the intermaxillaries being inclined upwards, which is common to all the known
 members of the group. The under profile is a long uniform curve, extending from the under

jaw to the end of the anal. The short trunk of the tail behind this fin is slender, and the

caudal is forked like the tail of a swallow with long tapering lobes, the lower one being con-

siderably the longest. The dorsal terminates just over the anus, and the belly is most pro-

minent opposite to it. The intermaxillaries ar^hort, lie transversely at the end of the snout,

and are armed with a single row of very short subulate teeth. Tine maxillary has a broad

disc, whose width exceeds half its lengtli, and whose end reaches to the articulation of the

lower jaw. It is shaped like the valve of a wide Pinna, and its fore shoulder only enters into

the composition of the orifice of the mouth. Its under edge, which lies on the limb of the

lower jaw, is toothed. The point of the lower jaw projects beyond the intermaxillaries. Eye

large, near the profile. About fifty scales enter into a row extending from the gill-opening

to the caudal, and there are fourteen rows in the height. The belly is strongly serrated by

fourteen teeth before the ventrals and thirteen behind them. The anal is long and low.

The scales are very silvery and are tinged on the back by brownish purple-red, and lower

down by a very pale cream colour.  The  jaws are  siskin-green                                                               there  is a purple  blotch on

   Icon. Reeves, 67 ; Hardw. Malac. 240, is a smaller drawing than the figure of abnormis,
but exhibits no other difference in form than a slightly shorter and less pointed pectoral. The
back is shaded with pale leek-green instead of brown, and the purplish tints of the head are
more extended, but the prevalence of the silvery lustre is so great that there is no striking
difference in the colours of the drawings. Length of the figure 14 inches. Number 241 in

   Mr. Reeves has deposited in the British Museum a dried specimen of this fish numbered

in accordance with his figure. Its form is symmetrical, the curve of the back corresponding
with that of the belly. The height of the body is greatest in front of the dorsal and ven-
trals, which are opposite to each other, and is contained thrice and three-quarters in the total
length. The upper jaw projects beyond the lower one, and the intermaxillaries form two-
thirds of the upper lip. The maxillaries are oblong, but taper towards their articulating ends.
They reach backwards as far as the anterior third of the eye : the articulation of the lower
jaw is under the posterior third. The eye has an elliptical iris, placed vertically like that of
a feline animal. There are forty-six scales in a longitudinal row, exclusive of three or four
smaller ones on the base of the caudal, and thirteen or fourteen rows in the height of the body.
The keeled belly is ai-med by thirteen spinous teeth behind the ventrals, and by about fifteen
before them ; but the latter are nearly obsolete. The ventrals are rather before the middle
of the length, caudal excluded. The upper parts are leek-green with silvery edges to the
scales, and the lower parts silvery and pearl-gray, with a crimson blush. Caudal and anal
oil-green. Dorsal and ventrals pale oil-green, the former tipped with carmine. Pectorals
yellow. There are some blue and carmine tints on the head.

    This fish approaches the CI. nasus, Bl. 429, f. 1, in form, but does not agree exactly either

with that figure or the Kome of Russell, 196, and there is a difference in the numbers of the

fin-rays.

   Mr. Reeves observes that the nose of this fish, when recent, was as transparent as glass,

and that he suspects some mistake in the characters of the Chinese name. It is not easy to
identify one among several species closely resembling each other with the short account given
of triza in the 'Amcen. Acad.,' but this figure corresponds most nearly with the characters
enumerated by Linnaeus. The C. thrissa of Osbeck has more rays in the dorsal. In form

fin lower and considerably longer. The snout is obtuse and shorter than the lower jaw, the
profile of the head arclied. The vcntrals, wliich are under the middle of the dorsal, are
equidistant from the end of the snout and base of the caudal. The point of the acute pecto-
rals passes beyond them and falls but a little; short of the anus. None of the other Chatoessi
represented in Mr. Reeves's portfolio have pectorals of equal length. The truncated end of
the maxillary reaches as far as the anterior third of the orbit. The eye is rather large and is
some distance from the profile.

   The scales are silvery and show towards their bases a mixture of blackish-green, oil-green
and honey-yellow, the dark green predominating on the ridge of the back. Below the late-
ral line blue tints are intermixed with the general silvery lustre, and the honey-yellow forms
faint longitudinal streaks corresponding with the rows of scales. There are some bluish and
purple tints round the eye, and a rich orange-coloured brown on the occiput and supra-sca-
pular region, which gradually disappears on the shoulder. The caudal is lemon-yellow, with
a flesh-coloured tint at the base and blackish-gray posterior edges. The other fins are pale

bluish-lilac.

    This drawing represents a fish with a higher body than C. triza, a more arched back and
a shorter anal. The height is equal to exactly a third of the length, including the extreme
tips of the acutely-forked caudal. The back is regularly and considerably arched ; the belly
is still more convex. The ventrals are a little before the middle, caudal excluded, and are
attached beneath the fore part of the dorsal. The top of the triangular pectoral falls con-
siderably short of the ventrals. The jaws are equal, the mouth small, and the maxillary
reaches only to the front of the eye, which is smaller and higher in the head than that of

 Ch. triza.
    The scales are brightly silvery, and are shaded towards the base on the back with dark

 leek-green. Below the middle they are sparingly shaded with pale bluish-lilac. The top of
 the head and edges of the gill-pieces are green ; there is a prussian blue patch at the tem-
poral groove and some carmine tints on the snout and suboperculum. The fins are gamboge-
and lemon-yellow, this colour being most faint on the dorsal and ventrals. The front of the
dorsal and bases of the pectorals and ventrals are tinged with carmine.

The Rev. George Vachell obtained a specimen of this fish at Canton and presented it to

the Cambridge Philosophical Institution. It is symmetrical in its form, the ventral and dor-

sal curves being nearly alike, and the height at the front of the dorsal very nearly equal to

one-third of the length, caudal included. The ventrals are attached before the middle, caudal

excluded, and under the fore-third of the dorsal. The posterior dorsal ray reaches, as in the

other species, to the base of the caudal. The belly is strongly serrated by seven teeth before

Athe ventrals and nineteen behind them.  notch in the upper jaw receives the pointed ex-

tremity of the lower one, which is scarcely shorter than the snout. The maxillary is rounded

at the end and reaches the middle of the eye.

The colour of the back is pale leek-green, which soon passes into pale honey-yellow. Be-

low the middle the yellow gives place to pale lilac. These colours are confined to the base

of the scales, which are very silvery, occupying however more and more of the disc as they

Aapproach the top of the back.  round black spot exists on the shoulder and is followed on

the flanks by five others, which diminish successively in size. The head is varied by yellow-

ish, brownish and crimson tints on a silvery ground. The rays of the pectoral are buffer

orpiment-orange, the caudal dull yellow with blackish-gray posterior edges, and the other

fins show a very pale bluish-gray tint. The Chinese name is the same as that of Ch. chry-

sopterus, which this species certainly closely resembles in form. The black spots may perhaps

disappear in some seasons.

The species is ranged by Cuvier among the Anchovies, whose bellies are not toothed ; but
the specimens show six teeth before the ventrals as fine as hairs. None exist behind these
fins. An adipose substance fills an angle before and behind the eye as in the Mackerels.

   The Stolephore japonois of Lacepede, or the Aiherina japonica of Houttuyn, Act. Haarl.
XX. p. 340, is probably the above species, with the rays of the dorsal imperfectly counted
and it is possible that the fish of which a notice from the ' Description of Animals ' follows
after CI. flosmaris, p. 303, may also be an Anchovy, though it is not represented as having a

projecting nose.

other from China. He particularly notices the smallness of the ventrals, so that it could not

be the pengay of Renard, f. 90, which he saw, as that has long ventrals, nor, as he is silent
about spots on the tail, is it so likely to have been the Mystas chitot of Pennant, ' View of

    Specimens exist in all the collections of Chinese fishes that we have seen. The scales are
used in the manufacture of artificial pearls, and the fish is eaten, when pickled, by the

Chinese. A Japanese specimen exists in the British Museum and is labelled "Adara" by

the authors of the ' Fauna Japonica.' It agrees with Coilia grayii in the number of its anal
rays, but has the form of C. playfairii and the same number of free pectoral rays. Its num-

    Mr. Reeves has deposited a specimen in spirits and also a varnished one in the British

Museum. We have not had an opportunity of comparing them with Indian examples, but
310 REPORT-- 1845.

we have little doubt but the Bynonyms we have cited above are correct, as the figures show
the characteristic black mark with white veins on the shoulder, and the indistinct stripe along
the middle of the anal. Mr, Reeves's drawing however, which agrees with his specimens,
shows a slight gibbosity on the hind head, which is not represented in the figures of Bloch
and Russell.

   The head is acutely ridged from the nape to the end of the snout, the sides sloping down
to the lateral ridges. The intermaxillaries are small and lie in the same line with the long,
slender acute maxillaries, which are composed of three pieces. These and the lower jaw are
set with fine teeth. There is no tongue, and the gills coming forward to the tip of the lower
jaw are connected by a narrow ridge-like isthmus, which is rough with minutely villiform
teeth. The head is contained nearly six times in the total length ; the height of the body
somewhat exceeds a fifth of the length, and the thickness is contained twice and a half times
in the height. The belly is serrated by thirteen teeth before the ventrals and nine behind
them. There are eleven rows of scales in the height of the body, and thirty-eight in a row
between the gill-opening and base of the caudal.

    The dorsal surface is coloured by dark grass-green, which is mixed with brown on the top
of the head ; the lower parts are brightly silvery. The black humeral patch is finely veined
with white. The dorsal and ventrals are pistachio-green, the former being blackish on the
edges and tinged with yellow in front. The anal is yellow in front, the rest of the fin being
green, darkening along the middle so as to form a stripe. The caudal is greenish at the base

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

bright saffron-yellow on the disc, and blackish-green on the edges. The pectoral is also saf-

   We have not seen an Indian or Chinese example of this, species, but specimens exist in the

British Museum from Port Essington, and have been described at length in the 'Annals and
Magazine of Natural History' as above quoted. One anomaly occurs in Mr. Reeves's draw-

ing, the existence of a pointed canine tooth in the upper jaw, whereas in the specimens the
edges of the jaws are rough with very narrow bands of minute teeth. The colours in the
Chinese painting are also different from those described by Forster, but Broussonnet's figure,
as well as George Forster's, correspond exactly in profile and size of fins, shape of head, &c.,
with Mr. Reeves's drawing. Russell's seems distorted, probably from the flaccidity of the
specimen.

    The discs of the scales are like frosted silver, and they have a well-defined border of a
polished silvery appearance. The scales of the lateral line are forty in number, and they are
marked by six or seven radiating, forked furrows. In Mr. Reeves's drawing the bases of the
scales on the back are shaded with bluish-lilac, which gradually changes on the sides and belly
to celandine-green. The sides of the head are oil- and siskin-green, the occiput being tinged
with hyacinth-red. The pectorals are yellow, which is mixed with brown on the upper
border; the last ray of the dorsal is sulphur-yellow; the rest of the fins are hair-brown, the
fronts of the dorsal and anal being wood-brown. Iris grass-green.

    This drawing represents a rather more slender fish than M. setipinnis, with a smaller eye,
narrower maxillary, fewer scales both longitudinally and vertically, the dorsal commencing
farther back over the axilla of the ventrals, and having with the anal fewer rays. The last
ray of the dorsal is shorter, and the last anal one more decidedly lengthened than the corre-
sponding rays of C. setipinnis. The bright silvery edges of the scales are not so sharply defined
and distinguished from the discs, which in this fish are leek-green above the lateral line, and
gradually change to pearl-gray towards the belly. The upper parts of the head are dark olive-
green. The dorsal and caudal approach to blackish-green, the latter being very dark ; the

    This drawing does not differ very greatly from the preceding one in form, but it represents
a fish having a more irregular dorsal outline and less arched, a more convex belly, and the
lateral line slightly decurved throughout its whole length. The face is gibbous just before
the eye, and there is a less marked convexity at the nape. The summit of the back is grass-
green, beneath which a blackish-purple band extends from the nape to the upper lobe of the
caudal, terminating rather abruptly about half-way to the lateral line. The rest of the side
is briglitly silvery with a slight gloss of pearl-gray. The top of the head is grass-green.
The edges of the maxillaries and gill-pieces are green and crimson. The dorsal and caudal
are leek-green, passing into blackish-green on the rays and edges ; the ventrals and anal are
pale mountain-green with some yellow ; and the pectorals are bright sulphur-yellow sprinkled
with a few dark green specks. The cluster of black dots on the cheeks and preoperculum
of E. machnata are not shown in this figure.

The British Museum possesses a specimen in spirits from Canton presented by Mr. Reeves,

vrhich we have not had an opportunity of comparing with the Indian fish. The drawings

of the latter differ a little in the position of the ventrals, but as this may have been owing

to inattention, we have not kept the Chinese fish distinct.

The Chinese specimen has a long canine on each small transverse intermaxillary. The

strap-shaped maxillary reaches to the middle of the orbit and the articulation of the lower

jaw; its edge is armed with small subulate teeth, which become very minute towards its tip.

Kach limb of the lower jaw is furnished with five or six tall slender teeth inclining backwards,

and having a short tooth between each pair. The venti'als are as near as possible in the mid-

Adle of the length, excluding the whole caudal fin from the bases of its lobes.  long nacry

appendage exists in front of the pectoral, and there is another in its axilla ; but the rest of

the skin is wrinkled and smooth, without scales, and resembling fine tinfoil in its lustre. The

teeth on the edge of the belly, shown in Mr. Reeves's figure, are not formed by pungent

scales, but by the points of the ribs. The belly is acute, like a knife, from the gills to the

anal. The cheek is soft and nacry, and the skin of the temples is striated. The head has a

scomberoid aspect above and its lateral ridges are smooth.

The colour of the back is pistachio-green, the rest of the fish brightly silvery with purplish

reflexions, and the courses of the muscles are shown by oblique lines meeting in the middle

height. Fins yellowish-gray, the edges of the caudal shaded with blackish-gray.

     In this Conger the vent is a little before the middle of the fish, and the dorsal fin com-
 mences over the centre of the ventrals. There is a pair of tubular nostrils or cirrhi on each
 side of the snout, and a pair of small holes or pores on each side of the mesial line in the in-
 terorbital space. The ground colour is ochre-yellow with irregular purplish-black blotches
  on the dorsal and back, and descending to the middle of the sides. Several of these blotches
  or bars enclose spots of the ground colour. The top of the head is purplish-black, and three
  dark spots are placed in a triangular position on the hind head. The cheeks, under part of
  the head and the anal have the bright ochraceous ground tint, the edge of the latter being
  dark. The dorsal and ventrals are mountain-green, the blotches on the former forming part
  of the bars which cross the back. The breadth of the head is equal to half its length, which
  is an eighth part of the whole length of the fish. Snout rather obtuse, gill-openings lateral.
  The rays of the caudal fin are shown at the tip of tlie tail, otherwise this might have been
  taken for an Ophisurus, which it resembles in its banded markings.

Ophisurus spadiceus, Richardson.

   A specimen of this fish was presented to the British Museum by John Reeves, Esq. The

snout, though not wide, has a truncated tip, and the distance between its extremity and
the anus is to the length of the fish, as 0'43 to 1-0. Three teeth stand in a triangle at the
extremity of the upper jaw, and behind them, the jaw teeth, consisting of a single row on
each side, meet in an angle on the symphysis, within which there are five or six small
teeth on the mesial line. The lower jaw is armed like the upper one with a single series
on each limb, but there are none anterior to the point at which these side lines meet. The
tip of the jaw is rounded and considerably shorter than the upper one. Nostrils very mi-
nute, with an orifice over the eye near its middle, having slightly raised edges, and another
terminating a short thickish tube on each side of the snout, and there are two minute lobu-
lets on the edge of the upper lip, the posterior one situated beneath the eye, and the other
half-way between It and the end of the snout. The throat forms a slightly plaited bag, and
the gill-openings are before the lanceolate acute pectorals and a little lower. The pectorals
contain eleven rays ; the dorsal commences immediately behind them, and like the anal, which
is highest anteriorly, terminates suddenly so as to leave a very short naked tip of the tail.
The rays of the fins are pretty conspicuous.

    The colour of the specimen, after maceration in spirits, is darkish wood-brown above the
lateral line, and whitish beneath, without any defined spotting. Length 13^ inches. Distance
between tip of snout and anus, 5'8 inches : length of the pectoral, 0-55 inch ; and height of the
body, 0-4 inch. This species possesses some of the characters ascribed to Oph. rostratus of
M'Clelland, but as he knows it merely from a drawing of Buchanan-Hamilton's, and conse-
quently has not said anything of the dentition, we cannot compare them. It is different from
those which he has figured in the Calcutta Journal, and also from Oph. boro (Ham. Buch.),
which has two rows of blunt teeth on the jaws and mesial line of palate, with three in a tri-
angle at the tip of the upper jaw.

The British Museum possesses a specimen of the harancha, which viras presented to General

Hardwicke by Buchanan-Hamilton, and also a Chinese Ophisurus procured at Canton by Mr.

Reeves, which diifer from each other so slightly that I hesitate to name them as distinct until

more recent specimens have been compared. We have had no assistance in the discrimina-

tion of these two specimens either from colour or anatomical structure.

The body of the Chinese fish is nearly cylindrical, and the fish tapers only in the com-

pressed end of the tail. It seems to have rather a smaller head than the Indian specimen

and a shorter cleft of the mouth, and exhibits a row of prominent pores on the lateral line,

which are not evident in the latter. Both have pores along the upper lip, round the eye and

on the snout. The fins in both are pale, and their origins and terminations easily made out.

The dorsal commences farther back than the tip of the pectorals, and almost meets the anal at

the end of the tail, but the extreme tip of the tail is naked. Teeth stoutly subulate and short

in two rows on the fore part of both jaws, but wider apart in the lower jaw : in one row on the

limbs of the jaws. Three or four near the symphysis of the upper jaw are a little taller than the

rest. They stand in two rows on the fore part of the mesial line of the palate, and in only

one row posteriorly.

The Chinese specimen, after a long continuance in spirits, has a dilute wood-brown colour,

and when examined through a lens, appears to be mottled with whitish specks mixed with a

smaller number of black ones. The whitish specks exist on the belly, but the black ones are

wanting there, hence the resulting tint is lighter. The Chinese specimen in the Br. Mus. is

H^nearly 12 inches long; one in the Cambridge Philosophical Institution measures  inches,

and the Indian one is I7f inches.

   The British Museum possesses a Japanese Moringua of which we do not know the specific
name, as the lable originally attached to it had been transposed before it was purchased by
the museum. It differs from M. htmbricoidea in its more slender, elongated body, narrower
fins and longer under-jaw. The rays are perceptible round the end of the tail only, the rest
being concealed by the thickness of the membrane. Tlie teeth are similar to those of lum-
bricoidea. Though the specimen is 26^ inches long, it is no thicker than a lumbricoidea only
ten inches in length. The genus seems to be the same with Ptyobranchus of J. M'Clelland,

but his Indian species all diflfer in the shape of the fins.

  We are ignorant of the internal structure of this fish, but from the posterior position of the

anus it is probably to be referred to the Sphagebranchidee of Miiller (^Ophicardides, M'Clelland).

   On consulting Mr. M'ClclIand's paper in the 18th number of the Calcutta Journal, I find
thatj'misled by the close similarity of the outline of Pneumabranchus cinereus in the fourth

volume of the above-mentioned journal to that of this Chinese fish, I erred in considering
them to be the same species. This fish has a naked skin, while the bodies of his Pneuma-
hranchi {Amphipnous, Miiller, 1840) are covered with imbricated scales.

   Hah. China. Chusan. Woosung.

Monopterus marmoratus, Temm. et Schl. (JJnibranchapertura).

The British Museum possesses an example of this species which was procured by Dr. Cantor

M^at Chusan. It is  inches long, the part behind the anus measuring 3 '45, and being con-

sequently proportionally a little shorter than the tail of either lavis or cinereus. The head is

decidedly larger than in either of these species, and when measured to the posterior corner of

the gill-opening, rather exceeds a tenth of the whole fish. A deep furrow runs along the middle

of the back, which is narrower than the belly from the head to opposite the anus, and the

action of the muscles produces a furrow coincident with the lateral line, which disappears

when the parts are stretched. The belly is rounded. The lateral line in the middle of the

height is composed of a series of very fine grooves, and is darker than the neighbouring parts.

The tail is edged above and below by a very narrow translucent seam of pale skin entirely

destitute of rays.

   The ground colour, after maceration in spirits, is wood-brown, thickly speckled on the
head, back and sides with dark umber-brown. On the top of the back the umber-brown specks

are arranged so as to produce three lines, one occupying the mesial groove, and the other two

the ridges on each side. On the sides the specks produce two series of short curves which

meet at the lateral line in an angle and seem to correspond with the fasciculi of muscular
--316 REPORT 1845.

fibres. The specks however are not confined to these lines. The belly is without specks,
but is marked by fine oblique brown lines which meet on the mesial line beneath, in an acute
angle, and thus produce a series of chevrons reaching from the gill-opening to the anus.

   I had given a specific name to Dr. Cantor's specimen, which was altered to mannoraUis, on
a Monopterus so named by the authors of the ' Fauna Japonica,' having reached the British
Museum. This fish is 23 inches in length, and the vent is rather farther back than in the
Chinese example, being only 3-2 inches distant from the point of the tail. Three rays ap-
peared very obscurely in the extreme tip of the tail.

pared his outline figure and account of Ophicardia phayriana with Mr. Reeves s drawing, we
have no doubt of both being members of one genus. In the Chinese fish the mouth is clett
rather farther past the eye, and this is the chief external difference between it and phaynana.

                                 ADDENDA.

   The preceding report was drawn up before any portion of the Ichthyology
of the 'Fauna Japonica' had reached this country, but as the successive
decades of that important work came out, the new scientific names therein
published have been substituted for those Avhich I had previously imposed,
the descriptions of such species have been struck out, and the Japanese fish
which had not been detected on the coasts of China were added. I have
also availed myself of the specimens of Japanese fish which the British Mu-
seum has from time to time received from Germany, and have adopted the
names on their several labels. But notwithstanding every exertion to avoid
the introduction of synonymous appellations, this evil cannot be entirely
averted, in cases like the present, when several works on the same subjects
are comino- out simultaneously. In some instances the names proposed by
English ichthyologists have the priority over those used in the ' Fauna Ja-
ponica,' the authors of this work having probably had no opportunity of
consulting the papers of Dr. Cantor and of John M'Clelland, Esq., of the
Beno-al Medical Service, published in India. There is also some interference
of names between the ' Fauna Japonica' and the ' Ichthyology of the Voyage
of the Sulphur,' composed of three fasciculi, of which the first one was pub-
lished in April 1844, and the third in October 1845. I may add also that
the genus Hoplegnatlms proposed by me in March 1841, and published in
the Transactions of the Zoological Society of London in 1842, is identical
with the Scarodon of the ' Fauna Japonica.' The tenth decade of this latter
work was brought to this country in March 1846, by its publisher, when the

seventh sheet of the Report Avas in the press, and it is therefore necessary to

make such corrections and additions to the previous sheets as are requisite

   This Tetrodon is marked much like T. albo-plumbeus, but the spines extend further along
the back to the tail, and there are some slight differences in the courses of the porous lines. It
is probable nevertheless that it is the same species with albo-plumbeus, since there are two other
Japanese specimens in the British Museum, which are intermediate between the two in the
extent of the spiny surface and in other minute characters. This being the case renders it
probable that the small specimen which we have reckoned to be a variety of ocellatus, under
the name of var. guftulata, ought also to be referred to albo-plumbeus.

   Prof. Allman, Mr. H. E. Strickland, and Mr. Babington,

    appointed for the purpose of Reporting on the Registration of Pe-

The duty assigned to your Committee being to consider and report on the

best means of concurring in the system of simultaneous observation of the
Periodical Phaenomena of Organized Beings adopted by the Belgian and other
continental naturalists, as proposed on their behalf at the Meeting of the
Association at Plymouth, by M. Quetelet of Brussels, the Committee have
judged it best, as a preparatory measure, to I'ecommend to the Section D.
(Zoology and Botany) to cause to be translated, and circulated among such
naturalists as might be willing to give their assistance, the Instructions pub-
lished and acted upon for a few years past by the continental naturalists

above mentioned.
   The translation having been revised and enlarged with the aid of the Rev.

L. Jenyns and M. de Selys-Longchamps, it is proposed by the Committee,
that copies should be circulated where they may be useful, in order to invite

and facilitate the co-operation of observers in various departments of natural

history.

                                                                                              Royal Academy, Brussels.

Whilst the earth performs its annual orbit, a series of phaenomena is un-

folded upon its surface which the periodical return of the seasons regularly
brings back in the same order. These phaenomena, taken individually, have
engaged the attention of observers in all times ; but to study them as a whole,
and to aim at ascertaining the laws of dependence and relation that exist be-
tween them, have been generally neglected*. The phases of the existence
of the minutest plant-louse, of the paltriest insect, are bound up with the

phases of the existence of the plant that nourishes it ; this plant itself, in its
gradual development, is in some sort the product of all the anterior modifica-
tions of the soil and atmosphere. That would be a most interesting study
which should embrace at once all periodical phaenomena, both diurnal and
annual; it would form of itself alone a science as extended as instructive.

   * There are doubtless few naturalists who have not collected some observations upon
periodical phaenomena ; but the greater part of their labours, from their being isolated, would
be nearly useless for the object which we propose to accomplish. The various calendars and
dials of Flora have been framed upon local observations, or such as, being made at different
epochs and under circumstances entirely dissimilar, could not be compared with one another

nor present that degree of exactness which science demands at the present day. The great

Linnaeus was fully aware of the utility to be derived from simultaneous researches on the
calendar of Flora, and considered that, if made in different countries, a comparison of them

would be followed by advantages as novel as unexpected. It is, then, this idea of the cele-
brated Swedish natm-ahst that we would wish to see realized. The United States of America

seem to be the country which has most fixed its attention upon such a system of simulta-

neous observations : the annual reports of the governors of the University of New York,

printed at Albany, regularly contain observations from thirty places on the flowering and

fructification of certain plants, on the arrival and departure of birds of passage, and on other

natural epochs.

It would not be possible to specify here all the observations of tliis kind which have hereto-

fore been undertaken ; even those made in Belgium by M. Kickx, sen. for 1811 (Flora Brux.)
and by Messrs. Pollaert and Dekin {Alman. du departem. de la Dyle, an. xii.), or those of our

habitual correspondents, Baron d'Hombres Fii-mas (Rec. de Jlem. et d' Obs,, &c.,Nismes,1838),

It is principally by the simultaneity of observations made on a great number

of points, tiiat these researches are capable of attaining a high degree of im-

Aportance.  single plant observed with care, would itself yield us information

of the greatest interest. Synchronic lines might be traced on the face of the
globe for its leafing, flowering, fructification, 8zc. The lilac, for example,

Syrinya vulyaris, flowers in the neighbourhood of Brussels on the 1st of

May ; a line may be conceived on the surface of the earth upon which the

flowering of this shrub takes place at the same date, as also lines on which

its flowering is earlier or later by ten, twenty, or thirty days. Will those

lines then be equidistant? will they have analogies with the isothermal

lines ? what will be the dependencies that will exist between them ?* so also

as to the isanthesic lines or lines of simultaneous flowering, will these have a

parallelism with the lines relative to the leafing, or to other clearly -marked

Wephases in the development of the individual ?  may conceive, for example,

that whilst the lilac is beginning to bloom at Brussels on the 1st of May,

there also exists a series of places northwards where this shrub is then only

putting forth its leaves ; has the line, then, which passes through these places
any relations with the isanthesic line which answers to the same date? It

may also be asked whether the places that have the leafing on the same

day, will likewise have the same day of flowering and fructification : it will
thus be seen, keeping to even the simplest data, how many curious approxi-
mations may be deduced from a system of simultaneous observations esta-
blished on a large scale. The phasnomena relating to the animal kingdom,

those especially connected with the migrations of birds of passage, will afford

results not less remarkable. .

   Periodical jjhaenomena may be divided into two great classes : the one be-

long to the science of physics and natural history ; the others belong rather

to the domain of statistics, and concern man living in the social state ; for
society itself, with all its tendencies to withdraw itself as much as possible

from natural laws, has not been able to escape from this periodicity of which

we are treating.

The natural periodical phasnomena are in general independent of the social

periodical phaenomena ; but this does not hold good of these latter with regard
to the former. It would therefore be a first step taken upon this ground so
little explored, and which seems to promise so much to the labours of those
who know how to cultivate it, to have commenced the simultaneous observa-

tion of all the periodical phaenomena connected with physics and natural

history.

These last phaenomena are themselves divisible into several classes, and

the study of them presupposes a considerable acquaintance with the meteoro-

logical pheenomena on which they principally depend. It is moreover not
without reason that meteorology should take the lead, and commence this
series of continued researches to which those observers who aspire truly to
follow nature in all her laws of organization and development will have now

to devote themselves.

   But meteorology, in spite of its persevering labours, has not hitherto been
able to ascertain more than the mean state of the different scientific elements

relating to the atmosphere, and the limits within which these elements can

vary according to climate and season. It is requisite that it should continue
its progress at the same time with the investigation now proposed ; and in
order to guide our judgement as to the observed results, it should show us,

as to the boundary lines for the culture of the vine, olive, &c. in their relations with isother.

at each step, whether the atmospheric influences are in a normal state, or

whether they manifest any anomalies.

   The desire of devoting myself to the study of periodic phaenomena upon a
rather extensive scale, led me to request several men of science both at home

and abroad to aid me with their views and observations*. The favourable

reception given to my requests has allowed me to believe that I was not de-

ceived as to the importance of the proposed researches ; I likewise saw that

it would be possible to compare our climate with those of the neighbouring

countries, by direct and simultaneous observations, and to obtain, for Belgium

in particular, valuable data which at present we do not possess.

However, to proceed in a useful manner, it is necessary above all things

that the observations should be made on the same plan, and it was not with-

out reason that the men of science to whom I applied, requested instructions

as to the objects to be observed, and the course to be taken in the observa-

tions so as to render them comparable, an essential condition for the attain-

ment of the proposed object. The following instructions have been drawn up

MM.to meet this demand, from suggestions furnished by  Cantraine, De Selys-

Longchamps, Dumortier, Kickx, Martens, Mowen, Spring, Wesmael, &c.

   There is one important remark to make, that should not be lost sight of,
viz. that we should agree upon certain observations which should be made in

preference, and essentially bear on the same scientific points in the several

countries in which the observations are made. The field to be explored is

so immense, that unless some rallying-points are adopted, the different ob-

servers will run a great risk of not concurring, and thus almost losing their

labour. For instance, when we point out some plants or animals which it

will be more especially desirable to observe, we do not wish to underrate the

utility of observations made on other species ; but this will be in order to

obtain points of comparison, or standards around which other observations will

easily arrange themselves. Our appeal may probably receive attention only

from isolated observers, and it is impossible for them to comply with all the

demands which we make respecting periodical phaenomena ; but if they are

desirous of undertaking those labours of detail to which we shall confine our

instructions, they will at least learn what should be their starting-points so as

to keep within the limits of the system generally adopted.

   * The observations on flowering were commenced in 1839, in the garden of the Royal Ob-
servatory at Brussels. The results obtained in 1839 and 1840 were printed at the end of the

observations on the meteorology, magnetism, and temperatures of the earth in 1840, in vol.
xiv. and xv. of the ' Memoires de I'Academie Royale.' In 1841, the simultaneous observa-

tions of MM. Kickx, Cantraine, Fr. Donkelaer, Martens, Morren, V. Deville, De Selys-Long-

champs, Robyns, Dr. Gastone, Van Beneden, Galeotti, Spring, Schwann, &c. commenced.
This system of observation was further extended in 1842 and 1843, and has been carried

beyond the frontiers of Belgium. The new observers are MM. de Spoelberg and Debroe
at Louvain, Fredericq and Spae at Ghent, M'Leod at Ostend, Vincent at Brussels, De
Martins at Munich, De Caisne at Paris, the Baron d'Hombres Firmas, jun. at Alais, B. Valz
at Marseilles, Bravais at Lyons, Couch in Cornwall, Blackwall in Wales, De Pierre and Wart-

mann at Lausanne, M. Achille Costa at Naples, Scherer, Camille Rondani and Colla at Parma,
Van Hall at Groningen and the Horticultural Society of Utrecht, who desired to form the
central point for the collection of observations made in the kingdom of the Netherlands,
which the learned Counsellor von Martins has been so obliging as to do for Bavaria and Ger-

many in general. The new assistance which has been promised in different parts of the globe,
give reason to hope that we shall soon be able to deduce the most valuable results from so ex-
tensive an association. Among the learned bodies which have promised us their support, we
may mention especially the Association of Natural History of Switzerland, the Royal Botanical

Society of Ratisbon, the National Institute of Washington, the Philosophical Society of Phila-

delphia ; but we ought especially to congratulate ourselves that one of the most illustrious coun-

trymen of Linnaeus, M. Berzelius, has spoken favourably of our scientific crusade in the Aca-

demy of Stockholm, where its formation was originally proposed, about a century ago.

--324 REPORT 1845.

  --Meteorology and Physics of the Globe. Those who are desirous of

studying thoroughly the meteorology and physics of the globe, and carefully
appreciating all the periodical changes which these two branches of our
knowledge present, should have recourse to the special report which has been
published on this subject by a committee of the Royal Society of London*.
 But the observations specified are so numerous and fatiguing, they require the
 operation of so many persons, that it has been hardly possible to find more
 than four or five observatories in Europe in which they are carried out to
 their full extent. In fact it has been undertaken to make observations every
 two hours, night and day ; and even, at a certain period in each month, to
 observe the magnetic instruments continuously for twenty-four hoursf. For-
 tunately for our plan, such laborious observations are not necessary as far as

 natural history is concerned ; our object is to direct attention much more to
 the arnmal than the diurnal variations, which may in their turn become the

 object of special and simultaneous study.
     The appeal which we now make being addressed especially to naturalists,

 we would restrict our demands to researches which are directly and essen-

 tially connected with the modifications presented by the three kingdoms under
 the influence of the seasons, and avoid fatiguing observers by requiring too

 much from them.
     The thermometer should occupy the first place among instruments to be

  consulted ; and the temperature of the air and earth should be simultaneously
  determined. The thermometer, exposed to the air, at the distance of some
  feet above the soil, should face the north in the shade, so that it may not be
  influenced by reflexion from the adjacent walls. It would be sufficient to note
  its indication each day at a certain hour; 9 o'clock a.m. would be the best.
  It would be necessary, moreover, to ascertain daily its minimum and maxi-

  mum, by means of a thermometer fitted for the purpose. The temperature

  of the earth, especially of those layers in which the roots of trees are imbed-
  ded, deserves special attention. It would be very interesting daily to trace
  the progress of three or four thermometers, the bulbs of which were equi-
   distant in a vertical line: the bulb of the first should be just beneath the
  surface of the soil, and that of the last at a depth of 23 to 30 inches. Pecu-
  liar thermometers, the stems of which project above the surface of the earth,
   and whose bulbs are rather large compared with the size of the tube, are
   constructed for these observations. These instruments should be placed in
   a soil similar to that in which the plants under observation grow, and which
   presents an unbroken surface, sheltered from the direct action of the sun.
   It would, moreover, be interesting to observe, as is done in the garden of the
   Observatory at Brussels, two series of thermometers, one exposed to and the
   other sheltered from the direct heat of the sun. The time for observation, as
   in the thermometer exposed to the air, should be 9 o'clock in the morning.

      The barometer should also be observed at least once a day, and at a fixed
   hour. Care should be taken to note its maxima and minima ; and each ba-
   rometric observation should be accompanied by the indication of the thermo-

   meter attached to the instrument.

      The hygrometer also yields valuable indications ; but its place may be ad-

    new meteorological work published by M. Lamont at Munich, and entitled ' Annalen fiir Me-
    teorologie und Erdmagnetismus.'

      t These observations have been continued at the Royal Observatory at Brussels since 1841.

vantageonsly supplied by the psychrometer, which is less liable to get out of
order, and the indications of which are much more correct.

  We do not detail the precautions requisite for these observations, for

which we merely refer to the ordinary treatises on physics.
   The force and direction of the winds should be carefully registered ; as

also the state of the sky. To indicate the degree of serenity, a decimal frac-
tion may be employed ; a perfectly serene sky being represented by unity,
and one completely overcast by zero. By this mode of notation the inter-

mediate states can be expressed in lOths.

   The quantities of loater falling, either as rain, hail or snow, should be col-
lected by the aid of udometers, either immediately after their fall or at fixed

times every 21< hours.

   The stormy, misty, &c. days should be noted. As to the state of the
clouds, Howard's system of notation may be advantageously employed.

   For those who are enabled to devote greater attention to the physical
phaenomena, we would recommend the observation of the electrical states
of the air, of terrestrial magnetism, falling stars, aurorse boreales, and earth-
quakes ; as also the temperature of springs, of plants and animals, as well as
the analysis of waters and the air. But the latter is now in progress under
the direction of M. Dumas, and we may expect the best results from labours
directed by so practised- a chemist. The appreciation of the quantity of
light and heat emanating from the sun, at diiferent periods of the year and

at various times of the day, has but little engaged the attention of philoso-
phers, and deserves more notice.

   Lastly, to those living at the sea-side, the times and heights of the tides
would be interesting subjects of observation.

 --Vegetable Kingdom. Observations relative to the vegetable kingdom

may be regarded in two points of view, according as they bear upon the
annual period or the diurnal period of plants. The annual period is that
space of time comprised between two successive returns of the leaves, the

flowers and the fruit; the diurnal period is the return of that hour of the day
at which certain species of flowers open ; for as all plants have fixed periods
for their leafing and flowering, so in like manner certain species of plants open
and close at certain hours of the day, and always at the same hours in the same
place. The results presented by these phaenomena are then of the greatest
interest, not only to meteorology, but also to botanical geography.

   In the study of them the principal object which ought to be aimed at is to
render the observations comparable, so that the results obtained on any given
point may be compared with those of other countries. The essential point
therefore does not consist in the large number of plants submitted to exami-
nation, but in the choice of the species and the identity of the comparable

conditions.
    It is with a view to the attainment of this object, that the following instruc-

tions have been drawn up :

  --1. Observation for the annual period. The first point in these observa-

tions is to discard annuals : in fact, these plants come up frequently at very
various periods, according to the time at which they were sown, so that the
indications furnished by them would not be comparable*.

    This consideration should also lead us to discard the use of biennials, be-

cause those which come up but slowly and towards autumn are necessarily

   * M. Bergsma, president of the Horticultural Society of Utrecht, has however truly re-
marked, that annuals might be usefully employed, provided precaution be taken to use in
every case the same seeds and to sow them on the same days.

--326 REPORT 1845.

Webehind those which come up in the spring.  admit of no exceptions

except as to the autumnal cerealia, such as rye, wheat, or winter barley,

which are always sown about the same time, and the phaenomena of the ve-

getation and flowering of which form the most important point in annual

observations, from their relating to plants so extensively cultivated. The

period of their being sown and that of the appearance of the ear should be

noted.

   From what we have said it is evident that the plants to be examined should
be perennials or woody. The latter are especially important, because they
are more subjected to the double combination of atmospheric and terrestrial
modifications ; and again, because they are better adapted than perennials for

observations on the foliation.

    It is of importance that the plants destined for daily observation should

have been planted at least a year ; for it is well known that vegetables trans-
planted in the spring present too much uncertainty in the periods of their

foliation and flowering, these periods being then subordinate to the formation

of the roots.

   In the choice of plants for observation we must avoid those which, flow-

ering through all the year, have formed their buds before winter, such as the

dandelion, chickweed and common groundsel, because these plants have no

determinate period, and the time of their flowering in early spring is irregular.
   All those cultivated plants which yield varieties by culture must be equally

avoided, as Tidipa Gesneriana, the rose-tree, the pear-tree, the cherry-tree,
the large-leaved lime-tree ; experience shows, that amongst varieties produced
in this manner from seed-beds, some flower frequently fifteen days before the

others. To be satisfied of the comparative value of the flowering of these
plants, it would be' necessary to observe everywhere the same variety, Avhich

is often impossible.

   Such plants as are too nearly allied in respect of species, and difficult

clearly to distinguish, should also be avoided : without attention to this, ob-
servers might be employing different species, which would prevent the ge-

neral operation from being comparative.
   Finally, all those flowers must be discarded, the aestivation of which does

not admit of our accurately noting the exact moment of expansion : such as

Calycanthus, Illecebrum, Aquilegia, &c.

The table of species marked out for the daily observations has been formed

from these considerations. In the construction of it our object has been to

obtain results which might be useful at the same time to meteorology, to

botany and to agriculture. With this view, we have aimed at representing all

the families of the European plants, excepting those which do not contain

plants fit for cultivation ; this consideration is of great interest with regard to

Webotanical geography.  have also introduced into it some North American

genera cultivated in Europe, as the Catalpa, Tradescantia, Menispermum, &c.,

in order that this list may be rendered comparable with that of observations
made in the United States of America. In each family we have selected in

preference the most common and diffused species, and amongst them such

species as have the flowers largest and best-developed. Finally, we have

selected flowers so as to present some species which blossom in each month of
the year. Amongst these plants are some which we especially recommend

to the attention of observers, such as rye, wheat, the lilac, the box, &c.

these are distinguished by italics.

The period at which rye, barley and winter wheat come into ear should

be carefully examined, this point being of great importance in agriculture.

In the district of Tournay it is a farmer's axiom that April is never seen to

go ovi witJumt com in the ear ; it is curious to determine at what period these

cerealia put forth the ear in the various parts of Belgium and Europe.

According to the request of a large number of observers, we have classed

the plants recommended to their attention in alphabetical order. The list
has been increased by the addition of some new plants ; but on the other
hand, the Academy has resolved not to include in its publication any plants

but those selected for the observers. To admit all observations indiscrimi-

nately would be to encumber the Memoirs of the Academy, and to render

comparisons almost impossible ; whilst, by the arrangement we have adopted,
an analysis of the lists may readily be made, and we shall be able to publish

with each plant the dates relating to it in each locality.

Having detailed the views by which we have been guided in drawing up

the table for annual observations, it remains for us to speak of the duties of

the observer.

LinuEeus, who first understood all that was to be deduced from the appli-

cation of meteorology to the vegetable kingdom, pointed out four periods

for observation, viz. the foliation, the flowering, the fructification, and the

fall of the leaf. Other authors have gone further ; they have multiplied the

details. In experiments intended to assume a general character, this ap-

pears to us neither necessary nor useful ; for by heaping up detail upon de-

tail, these observations cease to be comparable, and thus lose their principal

utility. Even in the data of Linnasus, there are some which are only applicable

to a few vegetables. For instance, the foliation and defoliation can hardly

be determined except on woody plants. It thus appears to us that we must

confine ourselves to the four data we have pointed out, paying special atten-

tion to the most important of all, that which alone would in case of necessity

Wesuflfice, viz. the flowering.  leave to each observer the care of noting

any peculiarities which may appear to him worthy of notice.

   In the order of observations, two methods may be employed ; we may

Weeither note the plants in their wild state or in their cultivated state.

think that the former does not present sufficient facilities, and is subject to too

much uncertainty, for the observer would be compelled to traverse daily very

diflPerent regions, at great distances apart, and would never be sure of making

a second observation on the same plant that he had first examined. Where

in Europe can we find two localities in which the same species of perennial

plants are to be met with upon a space sufiiciently limited for making the

daily observations ? It is impossible for the naturalist to observe daily the

fields, the woods and the meadows of his country ; he must then confine

Nowhimself to approximations.    that which is essential is, that the daily

observation of the plants fixed on for comparison should be made in similar
positions. From this consideration, we are of opinion that these observa-

tions should be made on individuals planted in an airy garden. The plants
should neither be sheltered nor exposed to a south wall. As regards trees,

they should be selected in open fields, but not in woods, which always afford

very unequal shelter.

As to the indication of the periods, they should be made, for the foliation,

when the first leaves burst the buds and become A'isible ; and for the
flowering, when the anthers are visible ; the same will hold good for the
flowers of the Compositce. The period for noting the foliation may offer

difficulties, from its presenting different phases, which, especially in sjsring,

may cause considerable differences. It is requisite, therefore, to have a fixed

when, from the advance of the vernation, the upper face of the outer leaves

becomes exposed to the action of the atmosphere and commences its vital
functions. The fructification should be noted at the time of the dehiscence

of the pericarp in dehiscent fruits, and these form the largest number; the in-
dehiscent fruits should be noted when they have evidently arrived at ma-
turity. Lastly, the defoliation should be noted when the greater part of the
leaves of the year have fallen off, it being fully understood that what relates
to leaves can only apply to the woody plants, excluding moreover the ever-
greens, the defoliation of which is successive.

   To the preceding indications, the observers would do well to append those
of all such phaenomena as they might consider of interest ; such are the mo-

difications which occur in the odours and colours of flowers or leaves, &c.*;
it would be especially desirable that they should annex the daily indications

of the mean temperatures, or what is still better, the maximum and mini-

mum temperature of each day.

 --2. Observations for the diurnal period. Independently of the annotations

of each day, which form the calendar of Flora, it is of much interest to re-
gister in each locality the hour at which certain plants expand and shut up
which are endowed with the faculty of performing these functions at a de-
terminate hour. But with regard to this, it may be thought too tedious to
require the results for every day ; it is proposed therefore to limit them to the
equinoxes and the summer solstice.

   In the formation of the table which relates to these plants, we need take

no notice of the views that have guided us in constructing the table for the
observation of the annual phaenomena. It will be conceived, that it is in-

different whether the plant submitted to horary observation be annual or not,

whether in the open earth or the orangery, &c, ; all that is requisite is that
the plant be healthy and exposed to the open air.

  We recommend especially the dandelion, Leontodon taraxojcum, which,

flowering throughout the year, will furnish a subject for curious observations.

    (^See below the tables ofplants to be observed.^

From the commencement of 1840, observations on the flowering of plants

have been combined with the meteorological observations at the observatory

of Prague t; these observations, made by M. Fritsch, relate to the flowering,

considered under five phases : the commencement of the flowering, the semi-

Weflowering, full flowering, the semi-defloration, and the defloration.  have

not thought it necessary to enter into these details in what concerns the ge-

neral system of observations.

might adopt a similar notation ; the absence of any sign would express an in-

termediate state.

 --Animal Kingdom. The department of science to which our attention is

directed, rests upon the physiological principle that every organic being,
whether an animal or plant, is essentially dependent on atmospheric air, as
well for its development as for the preservation of its existence ; and that
both its development and the exercise of its functions and habits are checked
or modified by the modifications of this same atmospheric air. Thus we
observe that epidemic and endemic maladies predominate in certain sea-

locality,whilst the following year barely the normal number is to be found there;
the stag and the roebuck shed their antlers at a period which is not invaria-

hended, do we not see the common partridge bring up its numerous family

our countries, and leave them, at an earlier or later period of the year ? the

caterpillar and the common cockchafer alarm us sometimes by their num-
bers in our plantations ? Our object should be, to observe the degree of con-

nexion subsisting between the animal, the plant, and the atmospheric air,
to show, by continued and accurate observations, the influence to which these
beings are subjected from the medium in which they live, and to attempt,
by this method, to explain in a positive manner such phaenomena as those

we have mentioned above. In animals (in the wild state), the period of

coupling, or the season of love, that of birth, that of moulting, whether
double or single, that of migration, that of becoming torpid and of awaking,
that of the first appearance, the rarity or the remarkable abundance of any
species, are the points which should be observed and indicated with exactness,
conjointly with meteorological observations. Unity of time and place, two
indispensable conditions, should exist betAveen these two kinds of observa-
tions, because it is from the data afforded by these observations that general
consequences are to be deduced.

   Each observer should form a table of his observations, and enter in it
in technical terms, as far as possible, the animals which he has observed.
It is the result drawn from these partial tables that will form the starting-
point of the inductions or corollaries serving to establish some of nature's
laws. It will be seen therefore that these tables should be made vip with
the greatest exactness. It cannot be denied that many difficulties attend
such researches, but it must not be lost sight of that the first attempts in
every science are always difficult, especially when they require the co-opera-
tion of a large number of persons.

   In order to render the mode of the simultaneous observations uniform,
we shall now enumerate some of the principal points to which we consider
we ought to call the especial attention of observers, reminding them that
the most common species, and such as exist in the greatest number of coun-
tries, must for several reasons inspire the greatest interest, and that the most
important observations will be such as are made in the country.

 --Mammalia. 1. Appearance and retreat of the bats.

   2. Frequency or rarity of some Insectivora {Talpa europcsa, mole ; Sorex,

shrew mouse ; of some Rodentia of the genera Mus and Arvicola).

   3. Commencement and termination of the lethargic sleep of the dormouse
(Myoxus).

    4. Moulting of the genus Mustela of the Carnivora. Appearance and re-
tirement of the badger (^Meles taxus, after its hybernation).

 --Reptiles. Retirement, reappearance and pairing of the Batrachia (frogsj

tree-frogs, toads, salamanders and efts).

   Mollusca The period at which the land and fresh-water gasteropoda quit
their retreat, the former to creep on the soil, the latter to swim on the surface

of the water.
    That at which cases of poisoning by muscles occur*.

  --Insects, Appearance of the following species. For these see the amended

List at the end of this Report, as recommended hy the Committee.

     * In the preceding remarks we have followed the indications of Professor Cantraine.

  --Fishes. 1. To point out, at stations situated on rivers

    The period of spring at which the species of the genus Clupea, denominated
 allis, Clupea alosa, L., the sardine, and shad, Cfinta (in Flemish meyviscK)

 ascend.

    The same with salmon and salmon-trout, Salmo salar, and S. irutta, L.
    The same for the sturgeon, Acipenser, L.
    2. As regards the fish which never leave the sea, to observe in the sea-ports
 or on the coasts, the periods at which the following arrive :
    The earliest herrings, Clvpea harengus, L.
    The earliest mackerel, Scomber scombrus, L., and some other quite common

 migrating fish.

  --Birds, As regards birds, we think we cannot do better than republish an

 extract of the notice of M. de Selys-Longchamps, presented to the Zoological

 Section of the British Association at its last meeting in Plymouth :
     " Zoology and botany should be first interrogated, to enable us to ascertain

 each year to what degree the variations in the meteorological constitution is

 capable of advancing or retarding the appearance of certain animals or the

 foliation and flowering of plants.

    " The Belgian naturalists have seen in how great.a degree these observa-

tions, with the precise dates, and repeated during several years, will render
more exact the means sought to be established in local faunas and floras, nay,
even in the general fauna of Europe

    " It is with the view of insuring the possibility of these comparisons which

I consider useful for ornithology, that I woiild earnestly invite naturalists to

concentrate their observations upon a certain number of species which are
difi'used throughout Europe, or nearly so. I have thought it best, for this

purpose, to select terrestrial in preference to aquatic species, because their
migrations are extended more regularly over all regions, and the determina-

tion of them is easier, insomuch that whilst living in a town we can make ob-
servations by means of common sportsmen, all these birds having a vernacular
name in the different European dialects. I am far from denying the utility of
similar observations made upon the migrations of aquatic birds ; but, I repeat,
that I believe, during the first years, for want of a sufficient number of stations,
we should have difficulty in collecting data for the deduction of general results
upon these species, which are only found ordinarily in large marshes or on

 the sea-coast.

    "I propose then, setting out from 1842, to study the precise date of the
migrations of about forty species, which may be divided into four sections :

    1 Those birds (as the swallow and nightingale) which come and pass the
summer and breed with us

   2. Such (like the crane) as are regular in their passage, but which merely
pass, without remaining

    3. Those birds (as the gray crow and the siskin) which sojourn in our
country throughout the winter and disappear in the fine season;

   4. Such birds (as the waxwing and the stormy petrel) the passage of which
is accidental at indeterminate periods. I have departed from the principles
mentioned in selecting this latter class, but I thought it would be important
to direct attention to two or three species the causes of whose appearance
are unknown, as the waxwing, or are closely connected with the occurrence
of sea tempests, as the Procdlaria jielagica.

   " The first division will, I believe, consist of the same species for all Europe
but it will be diflPerent with the other three: in one country, for instance Hol-

land, the stork will be in the first division, whilst elsewhere it will belong to

the second, as in Belgium. The same will hold good with the third and
fourth, according to the more or less northern latitude at which the observa-
                              --; ;

tions are made ; and it is just these corrections which will, I hope, serve to
show the utility of the work which we are desirous of seeing undertaken in
the greatest possible number of localities."

Birds selectedfor the observations. (See this List at the end, as amended by
                       the Committee for the tise of English Observers.)

M. de Selys thinks the determination of the period of departure needs less

to be insisted upon, being aware of the great difficulty attending it ; how-

ever, exceptions should be made, especially'in the case of swallows, quails,

wagtails (Mot. alba), and the crow.

   To the observations on the arrival and departure of birds, we may advan-

tageously append those which M. Cantraine proposes :
   Of the period at which "crows, starlings (Sturnus vulgaris, L.) form into

flocks, or pair off;

Of the period at which the magpie (Corvtis pica, L.) commences its'nest
Of the period of moulting
Of the period at which the sparrow (Fringilla domestica, L.) selects a

companion, a time remarkable for scenes of quarreling, which are often more

readily distinguished by the ear than the eye. The period at which it begins

to build should also be noticed.

   The thrush (Turdus musicus), the field-fare {Turdus pilaris) and the

missel thrush ( Turdus viscivorus) deserve particular attention, inasmuch as
they are regular birds of passage throughout the greater part of Europe.

These birds are also the more readily ot«erved, as, being in request for the

table, they are found in all the markets.

   As M. Cantraine has observed, " we should point out, as far as possible,
the local circumstances which may cause any species to prolong its stay in

any particular place. Thus, on the 9th of October ISil, swallows were still
in immense numbers in the vicinity of the north and south stations on the

Brussels railroad, whereas they had quitted Ghent about the 17th of Septem-

ber, and but few individuals were to be seen at Ath on the 25th of that month.

Should not this long stay be attributed to a more elevated temperature,

caused by the locomotive engines stationed there, as well as to a greater

abundance of food, the consequence of this?"

The naturalists of the south of Europe will not allow the arrival and de-

parture of the flamingo (Phcenicopterus antiguorum), nor of some species of
sea-gulls (Laras melanocephalus, &c.), nor of the tunny (Scomber t/iynnus),

to escape their attention.                                  ^^ QuStelet

   * Tliese lists contain some species not in those originally proposed in M. Quetelet's
memoir. This is at the suggestion of M. Edm. De Selys-Longchamps and the Rev. L.

Jenyns, the former of whom assisted M. Quetelet in the first instance in drawing the lists

up, especially that of birds. These gentlemen met and reconsidered the subject at the
period of the Meeting of the British Association at Cambridge in June 1845, and the fol-
lowing are the levised lists which they propose to be adopted. In this instance they are
particularly an-anged with a view to English observers ; some of the species of birds origi-
nally named being extremely rare or accidental in this country, if they occur at all ; and others,
which are regular migrants on many parts of the continent, being stationary in Britain

throughout the year.

    N.B. All the lists are an-anged in alphaUetical order.

   t Care must be taken precisely to determine the species of Bat observed.
   J This species is stationary in the south of England, but in some of the northern coun-

ties as well as in Scotland is migratory.

   * It was thought desirable to make a separate list of these species, all of which are in-
cluded amongst the regular migrating birds selected for observation in M. Quetelet's ori-
ginal list, but which in this country are either very local, or of only accidental occurrence.
Wherever or whenever observers have an opportunity of noticing them, the dates should be

preserved.

    t This species generally occurs in this country in the autumn, or at least not tUl after the
breeding-season.

   J Both these species are particularly inserted in M. Quetelet's list, it being thought that
their occasional appearance inland is generally more or less connected with tempestuous
weather. TheLr occurrence, however, would not seem to be confined to any particular

season.

    § It would be desirable to note, wherever it can be done, the exact period of departure
of any of the species in the foregoing lists of summer and vrinter migrants ; but as it is in
general difficult to determine this, it is only especially recommended in the case of the
swallow tribe.

    II In the case of these species it will be well to notice the period at which the great bulk
take their departure, as well as the date of the last individual's being seen. It will also be
proper to notice the exact time of swallows and martins congregating, which takes place for
a longer or shorter period before they depart.

                          ON THE VITALITY OP SEEDS.                            337

Fifth Report of a Committee, consisting o/H. E. Strickland, Esq.,
   Prof. Daubeny, Prof. Henslow, and Prof. Lixdley, appointed

   to continue their Experiments on the Vitality of Seeds.

These experiments have been commenced as in previous years, in accord-

ance with the specified instructions.

   The Committee have this year expended 9/. 155. lOd. in the purchase of
seeds and incidental expenses (including Curator's salary).

   Seeds of 23 genera have been added to the Seminarium at Oxford, of
which 1 was contributed by H. E. Striciiland, Esq., 4 were gathered in the
Oxford Botanic Garden, and 18 were purchased of Mr. Charlwood.

   The increasing difficulty of procuring a sufficient quajitity of seeds of ge-
nera not previously subjected to experiment, induces the Committee again
earnestly to solicit contributions of seeds, either of a recent or of any known
date, from all persons interested in the inquiry who may have such at their
disposal. To be addressed to the Curator, W. H. Baxter, Botanic Garden,

Oxford.

   The following is a list of the seeds distributed this season :

           ON THE KEW OBSERVATIONS.                341

On the Kew Observations. By Francis Ronalds, Esq.

Mr. Francis Ronalds, on presenting the Annual Journal of Electro-meteo-

rological Observations made at the Kew Observatory, confined himself al-

most exclusively to an enumeration of its different heads.
   The introductory portion begins with the description of a little variation

in the cap of the principal conductor, which variation might possibly (he

said) affect slightly its electrical indications.

   He secondly described (for the possible safety and convenience of future

observers) a rnethod of raising and lowering the principal conductor.
   Thirdly, the result of his experience as to the best method of maintaining

the little collecting flame (of Volta) in a fit condition, &c., in strong gales, &c.
   Fourthly. Three registering electrometers, the principle of which consists

in causing the hand or arm of a clock connected with the principal conductor

to charge electrometers contained in air-tight vessels, together with chloride
of calcium, and to leave the electrometers thus charged entirely separated

from any other body than their supports.

AFifthly.  pluvio-electrometer, which is a large copper dish properly in-

sulated on a warmed glass column (as usual) upon the roof, and connected

with electrometers in the interior of the Observatory. This apparatus has

exhibited strong signs oi positive electrization at moments when the principal
conductor was charged negatively (the latter much more highly, of course).
The phaenomenon occurred when a storm was imminent, but before any rain

had fallen, and the result had been expected.

  ASixthly. simple modification of the Coulomb electrometer, which renders

this excellent instrument capable of employment in all states of the air (as

to humidity) : in using it, the usual kind of tedious manipulation is in a very

great degree diminished. The principal alteration consists in placing the vi-

brating (or moveable) needle in perfect metallic contact with the fixed needle.

[There are other improvements.]

  ASeventhly. few details concerning improvements of his Balance Anemo-

meter.

   The Journal itself is preceded by some necessary explanations, «Src., which
show that the regular number of observations of many instruments per diem
has been greatly enlarged since the 1st of January (1845). The registering
electrometers enable the observer to add the hours of 12, 2 and 4 to the other

hours of observation, and thus to complete two-hourly observations of atmo-

spheric electricity for the whole day.

   Under the head of experinients, &c., are detailed a few on the electrical
insulation, at two different heights, of two conductors, whose upper extre-
mities had the same height above the earth. The object was to obtain a
few useful data for other observers of atmospheric electricity.

   And another on a rather extraordinary case of electrization without insu-
lation (in the usual sense of the word) : it was a case of the St. Elmo fire

probably.

On Algebraic Equivalence. By the Rev. T. Jarrett, Professor of Arabic

                                    in the University of Cambridge.

Many algebraic series, when applied to particular cases, have been found to in-

volve numerical absurdities. Attempts have been made to explain these contradic-
tions by means of metaphysical refinements, but in most cases without success.
The object of the paper was to remind mathematicians that the series in question
arise, in most cases, from a succession of operations, in each of which a portion of
the result is neglected, and that the accumulated effect of these omissions shows
itself in a numerical absurdity in particular cases. The writer took the binomial
theorem as an instance, and showed in what way the demonstration would most
naturally proceed, from the simple case of the index being positive and integral, to
the cases of a negative integer, and of fractions both positive and negative. This was
done by means of a notation* which expresses any series by its general term, and by
means of which the operations of multiplication and involution can be as readily
performed on a series as on a single term. The result arrived at was, that no de-
pendence ought to be placed on, nor any use made of, the binomial theorem without
the express limitation that either the index must be an integer, or that the second
term must be less than the first.

   Many eminent mathematicians have explained the above-mentioned numerical

absurdities, by making a distinction between algebraic and arithmetical equality, as
founded on an assumed difference between symbolical and arithmetical algebra, and
resulting in a separation between equivalence and equality. The writer called in
question the justice of this distinction, and asked for information on a point so im-
portant in estimating the truth and value of analytical investigations.

               On Imaginary Zeros, ^c. By Professor Young.

   The principal object of this paper was to remove certain contradictions involved in
the prevalent theories of conjugate points, and to supply correct principles for their

--determination. These principles are thus announced : 1 . Let the equation be solved

for one of the variables ; then, if any pair of values for x and y, which satisfy this
explicit equation, differ from real values only by the entrance of an imaginary zero

--in whichever direction that zero be reached those real values will be the coordinates

of a conjugate point. 2. If it be inconvenient to solve the equation for one of the

variables, we may take a differential coefficient of any order whatever : then, if a

pair of values for x and y render this coefficient imaginary, and at the same time
satisfy the rational equation of the curve, those values will belong to a conjugate

point.

   The author further shows that it is equally correct to regard a conjugate point
as an evanescent oval, or as a real point through which an imaginary curve passes :
in the former view the differential coefficient, at the point, is indeterminate and real
in the latter view it is determinate and imaginary.

A* full account of this uotatiou, with numerous applications to pure analysis, will be

found in the writer's ' Essay on Algebraic Development.'

On Triplets. By the Rev. C. Graves, M.R.I. J., Professor of Mathematics

       On tlie Equation of Laplace's Functions. By George Boole.

   The method by which the integral was obtained is the one developed in a paper
on a General Method in Analysis, published in the Philosophical Transactions for
the past year, and I may be allowed to express my opinion, founded on a very care-
ful examination of the subject, in which I have obtained no less than six distinct
forms of the integral, that this is the only way in which we can obtain asymmetrical

solution free from integral signs.
   The equation of Laplace is

                  d / <\ du   1 dr u

and the integral in question

where

1^ and X denoting arbitrary functions. This integral consists of two particular ones,
and I have proved that when the arbitrary functions which they involve are so as-
sumed as to produce together real forms for v, the results are the same as would be
got by confining ourselves to one solution, and equating separately to the real and
the imaginaiy portions. This seems to be an usual, perhaps it is a general property of

--differential equations which involve in their solution the imaginary unit \/ 1 ; and

it is important, because it shows that a particular integral taken with this license of
interpretation becomes a general one.

  By giving to the arbitrary functions the general form 0/^^"'+ c' s"""^^"', and

prefixing 2 to the result, I have obtained the following real form of solution,

                    =« 2{a/(/4) + t/(-,")}cosr<p;

with a similar one in multiple sines, a and b being arbitrary, and

                                                      \a /f^fit.
The summation is quite unlimited with respect to r, that is, r may be positive or

negative, integral or fractional. In all cases the coefficient of cos r (p is a finite

function of ^, which is an unexpected result.

   In the case of Laplace's functions, the summation extends from to «, including

only integer values of r. On determining the constants, we get

       = + +P AnAo 2 (Ai cos (p -f- Aj cos 2 tp , .      cos n <p),

where in general

                              1.2, .7j-f-r 1 .2..n-- r'

and/ (/*) is as above. I think it is evident that in deducing these functions from
the general integral of the equation which they satisfy, we not only employ the na-
tural and direct method of analysis, but also gain something in the final result, as

respects simplicity of form and elegance of expression.

          On the Premises of Geometry. By H. Wedgwood, 3I.A.

   The conception of geometrical figure, as traced out by the motion of a point, ne-
cessarily supposes in the student the capacity of comparing the direction of that mo-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                             3

tion at successive instants of time, and of distinguishing, at a second point in the

course pursued, a direction identical with a given direction at a former point. He

will accordingly be able to form a conception of the path traced out by the genera-
ting point moving continuously in a single constant direction, or returning again to
the same constant direction after having quitted it, and moved for awhile in a path
of any other description, and he might thus originally acquire the notion, in the for-
mer case, of a straight line ; in the latter, of parallel straight lines.

    Again, the possibility of drawing a straight line direct to any given point in space,
involving (as it does) the identification of points determined by diflFerent paths di-

verging from a common starting-point, supposes in the student the capacity of esti-

mating the distance virtually advanced in the direction of given coordinates whilst
actually moving in a path of any description. Hence the fundamental standard of
position expressed in the following definition. Certain points are said to coincide or
occupy the same position when the whole space by which respectively they are separated
from a point antecedently known is identical in respect both of distance and direction.

    In the conception of superficial figure the inclination at each successive point
 (measured by the direction of the resistance, supposing the surface to be that of a
hard body) is analogous to the direction in the case of linear figure. The superficial
figure corresponding to a straight line will accordingly be a surface opposing (when
solid) at every point an absolute resistance to pressure in a certain constant direc-
tion, and the fundamental definition of a plane will be a surface passing through every

point which can be reached from a given point under the condition of a total negation

of motion in a certain constant direction.

Exposition of a System of Quaternions. By Sir William R. Hamilton,

                                                    M.R.I.A.

   In this system letters did not mean quantities but directions, and the operations
analogous to addition, multiplication, &c., had neither the same meaning, nor were
they governed by the rules of these operations in common algebra. It was to an
explanation of their meaning and exemplifications of the application of this calculus,

and the facility which it afforded of arriving very simply at results of difficult attain-

ment by the ordinary methods, that Sir W. Hamilton confined himself in this com-
munication. Sir W. Hamilton said that he wished to have placed on the records

the following conjecture as to a future application of quaternions : is there not an

= --analogy between the fundamental pair of equations, ij k,ji =. k, and the facts

of opposite currents of electricity corresponding to opposite rotations?

A description of a Machine for finding the Numerical Roots of Equations,

  and tracing a variety of useful Curves. By F. Bashforth, B.A., Fellow

It may be applied to the solution of equations in the following manner. Suppose

that the proposed equation is                                 =-t-p,,  0, . . . . . («.)

If now about a point we describe a circle with radius a, and also about the same

point trace the curve

not beyond the limits 1 and 1 which satisfy «.

 --To find the remainder of the real roots of («.), we may write for x, and find the

+ --This solution, in fact, depends on a ready method of trying all values of x between
    1 and 1, and selecting those which satisfy the equation.

It may be observed, that

+ --as 6 changes from to tt, x or cos 6 changes from 1 to 1

and therefore it is evident, from the form of (/3.), that the curve (5.) will have an axis,

and for every root of («.) we shall have two readings. If the readings give the same

value of X, this will probably be the true value ; if different, they will most probably

+be limits, as in one case x is in the course of being gradually diminished from                                          1

-- --to 1, and in the other of being increased from 1 to +1.

We have also a means of estimating the probable correctness of a root furnished

by the several angles at which the curve cuts the circle. By the help of this engine

we may also trace curves of the form

    On a System of Numerical Notation. By Thomas Wright Hill.

 --This was proposed to be founded upon the number 1 6, and those derived from it

by successive division by 2, such as 8, 4, 2, 1. By the combinations of these all
numbers were to be formed, and by attaching letters as the marks or names for the
elementary numbers, a system of nomenclature was obtained. The plan also pro-
vided figures and names for them essentially negative, and thus fit for promiscuous

incorporation with positive numerals on whatever scale of notation.

             On the Nebula 25 Herschel, or 61 o/ Messier's Catalogue.
                                    By the Earl of Rosse.

Lord Rosse exhibited to the Section what he called his working plan of this nebula,

and explained his method. He first laid down, by an accurate scale, the great fea-

tures of the nebula as seen in his smallest telescope, which, being mounted equa-

torially, enabled him to take accurate measurements; he then filled in the other

parts, which could not be distinguished in that telescope, by the aid of the great

telescope ; but as the equatorial mounting of this latter was not yet complete, he

could   not  lay these  smaller portions down with  rigorous  accuracy                                       yet  as  he  had
                                                                                                       ;

repeatedly gone over them, and verified them with much care, though by estimation,

he did not think the drawing would be found to need much future correction.

   Sir J. Herschel exhibited a model of the globe of the moon in relief, expressing
the forms and elevations of its mountains as seen in a good telescope. This beau-
tiful and exquisite work he stated to be the performance of a Hanoverian lady,
Madame Witte ; modelled by her from actual observation through an excellent
Fraunhofer telescope, in a small observatory at the top of her own dwelling-house

the selenographical positions and general contours of the principal craters and other
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  5

 leading features being first laid down on the smooth surface from Messrs. Beer and
 Maedler's raicroraetrical measures and charts. The diameier of the model is 1 2 inches
 85 lines (Rheinland measure), or one 10,000,000th part of the moon's actual dia-
 meter. The scale of heights is, however, necessarily enlarged to double this amount,
 as otherwise the relief would be too low for distinctness. The material is a compo-
 sition of mastic and wax, and the whole is worked out in such perfection of detail as
 to represent every visible crater and mountain peak, nay, even the minuter lines of
 elevation which streak the so-called seas, &c. in their true forms and conventional
 proportions. In consequence, when properly illuminated, and placed at thirty or

 forty feet distance, and viewed through a good telescope, the artificial is scarcely
 distinguishable from the real moon. The delicacy and precision of the work can
 only be appreciated by a microscopic examination. In fact, the whole model is

 stated by Madame Witte to have been executed with the aid of magnifying glasses.

 Sir J. Herschel accompanied his explanation of this model with several remarks on
the physical constitution of the moon in respect of climate, atmosphere, moisture,
 &c., and compared its surface with the chart of part of Mount Etna, lent him for
that purpose by Baron von Waltershausen, and with a drawing of his own of one of
 the principal craters as seen in his 20-feet reflector, placing the volcanic character

of the ring mountains beyond all doubt. By the aid of a large chart by Messrs.
Beer and Maedler, several of these, such as Aristarchus, Tycho, Kepler, Coperni-
cus, &c., were pointed out and their peculiarities described, their places on the model
being fixed by the aid of brass circles, representing the moon's equator and meri-

dians. This work, it is understood, will be submitted to the inspection of the
Astronomical Society, on the resumption of their meetings in November. Speaking
of the climate of the moon. Sir J. Herschel considered as probable the attainment

of a very high temperature (far above that of boiling water) by its surface, after ex-
posure to unmitigated and continual sunshine during nearly a whole fortnight. The
moon therefore, when at the full, and for a few days after, must be, in some small de-
gree, a source of heat to the earth ; but this heat, being of the nature rather of culinary
than of solar heat (as emanating from a body below the temperature of ignition),

will never reach the earth's surface, being arrested and absorbed in the upper strata
of an atmosphere where its whole effect will necessarily be expended in the conver-
sion of visible cloud into transparent vapour. The pheenomenon of the rapid dissi-

pation of cloud (in moderate weather) soon after the appearance of the full moon
(or of a moon so nearly full as to appear round to the unassisted eye), which he
stated himself to have observed on so many occasions as to be fully convinced of
the reality of a strong tendency in that direction, seemed to him explicable only on

this principle*.

On the Projection of a Star on the Dark Limb of the Moon just before its
                        Occultation. By Professor Steveily.

   This the Professor considered to be a result of diffraction. Sir Isaac Newton
having observed the shadow of a hair placed in a strong beam of sunlight to be
broader than the hair itself, was led to investigate the course of a ray as it passed
by the edge of a body, like the edge of a knife placed across a hole in the window-
shutter, through which a sunbeam is admitted. Beyond a certain distance the rays

proceeded in their usual straight courses ; at that distance they were bent towards
the edge ; but the courses of the nearest rays were bent away from the edge, so as
to form curves convex towards it. The undulatory theory enables us to trace these
curves, and they are known to be of the nature of the hyperbola, with asj^mptotic
branches extending onwards from the diffracting edge. Prof. Stevelly conceived the

dark limb of the moon to be such a diffracting edge to the slender beam of light which
reached us from a fixed star ; and that as the curve was, at the last moment the light
was allowed to pass, convex towards the moon, the portion of the ray which last
enters our eye before the star disappears, being the direction in which we should
then see the star, if produced backwards, would meet the moon on her dark surface.

   * On the conclusion of Sir J. Herschel's explanation, Baron von Waltershausen entered

into further particulars of the nature of the volcanic phasnomena on the surface of Etna, as
represented in the elaborate chart above alluded to, of the environs of Nicolosi, and pointed
out many particulars of resemblance to the lunar volcanoes.

                              On the Heat of the Solar Spots.
            By Professor Henry, of Princeton College, New Jersey.

    Sir D. Brewster read an extract of a letter which he had just received from Prof.

Henry, who had recently been engaged in a series of experiments on the heat of the
 sun, as observed by means of a thermo-electrical apparatus applied to an image of
the luminary thrown on a screen from a telescope in a dark room. He found that

 the solar spots were perceptibly colder than the surrounding light surface. Prof.
 Henry also converted the same apparatus into a telescope, by placing the thermo-
 pile instead of the eye-glass of a reflecting telescope. The heat of the smallest
 cloud on the verge of the horizon was instantaneously perceptible, and that of a
 breeze four or five miles off could also be readily perceived.

 Description of a Universal Stand applicable to the Use of Astronomical Tele-

    scopes. By M. BoGUSLAwsKi. Communicated by the Rev. Prof. Challis.

    A solid cylindrical axis, which in its normal position is vertical, carries at its

  upper extremity the two supports of a horizontal axis, at one extremity of which is a
  graduated circle A, and at the other, the telescope having its direction of coUimation
  perpendicular to this axis. The solid cylinder turns in a hollow cylinder of double
  the length of the telescope, and having at its upper end another graduated circle B.
  The hollow cylinder rests at about, its middle on two supports, which stand on a
  circular base adjustible by foot screws. It is also capable of motion about a hori-
  zontal axis, and carries at its lower end a counterpoise to the weight of the telescope
  and circles, and a graduated arc, by means of which its axis may be set to any re-
  quired elevation. The instrument may consequently be either a portable transit, or

  A Ba transit-circle, or an altitude and azimuth instrument, being the altitude and
 Athe azimuth circle, or, lastly, an equatorial, in which case is the declination circle
  and B the hour circle. The telescope is in no case in a position in which observa-

   tion is impracticable.

  On certain Points in the Elliptic Polarization of Light by Metallic Reflexion.
                     By the Rev. Professor Powell, M.A., F.R.S.

      The object of this communication was supplementary to one given last year (see
   Sectional Proceedings, 1844), since which time the author has continued his re-
   searches into some parts of the subject not before adverted to.

      The original plane of polarization being inclined 45° to that of incidence on the
   metal, in the lower degrees of ellipticity, i. e. at lesser incidences, the dislocated
  rings preserve the distinction of the dark and bright systems ; which they lose when

   the vibrations are absolutely circular : also at the position of the analyser interme-
   diate to the rectangular positions, the coloured arcs assumed a peculiar distorted

   appearance.

     A generalization of the formula, employed in the author's paper, Phil. Trans.

   1843, so as to include all positions of the polarizer and analyser, and assuming the
   component vibrations with general or unequal coefficients, is necessary for explain-
    ng the last-mentioned phaenomenon ; while the former supplies the best means of
   directlv observing the change in the virtual plane of polarization of the reflected ray,

    system of rings : as e. g. that for dark branches.

       These changes in general are analogous to, but not the same as, those in the re-
   flexion from transparent bodies examined by Fresnel. But at the incidence for the
   maximum, as well as at that nearest the perpendicular, they are the same.

       At small incidences, in his former communication*, the author mentioned that he
   had been led to suppose an anomaly in this respect, the arc appearing to deviate
   from 45°. But more recent and careful repetitions have shown that the results are
    really conformable to the law in this case.

reflexions, determined by Sir D. Brewster (Phil. Trans. 1830).

   The change of plane cannot yet be explained by theory ; though the empirical
formulas of Prof. MacCullagh appear to give a good representation of it, when the
data for steel resulting from that investigation are introduced into the author's for-

On a New Polarity of Light, with an Examination of Mr. Airy's Explanation
  of it on the Undulatory Theory. By Sir David Brewster, F.R.S.L, ^ E.,

   M.R.I.A.

Notwithstanding the great power of the undulatory theory in explaining phae-

nomena, and its occasional success in predicting them, I have never been able to

consider it as a representation of that interesting assemblage of facts which consti-

tute physical optics. When a theory of high pretensions, and remarkable for its

powers of accommodation, is found incapable of explaining whole classes of well-ob-

served and distinctly marked phsenomena, those who have discovered or studied these

phaenomena may be excused for withholding from it their assent, and for not wholly

abandoning older, though less popular views, which were sanctioned by such

authorities as those of Newton and Laplace.  myIt has fallen to  lot to lay before the

public several of the facts to which I refer ; but as it is not the object of this notice
to discuss the general merits of the undulatory theory, I shall mention only two of

those classes of facts which the undulatory theory has failed to explain. The first

of these, which was communicated to the Royal Society about fifteen years ago, em-

braces the phsenomena of transverse fringes which cross the fringes produced by

grooved surfaces, and produce, both in common and homogeneous light, a series of

phaenomena equally beautiful and singular. In these phsenomena we witness the

extraordinary fact, that a stripe of polished metal is incapable, at various angles of

incidence, of reflecting a single ray of homogeneous light ; while, at intermediate

angles of incidence, it reflects that light freely. The undulatoiy theory has never

ventured to explain these phaenomena, and I feel confident that they are beyond its

power ; and hence the phaenomena themselves have excited no notice, and have

shared the fate of all such intractable discoveries as refuse submission to the prevail-

ing theory of the day. The second group of phaanomena which the undulatory theory

is equally incapable of explaining, present themselves in looking at a perfect solar

spectrum, or a diffraction spectrum, through the edge of a thin plate of glass, quarts,

or mica. If we cover one-half of the pupil of the eye with such a plate, and thus

view the spectrum so that the rays which pass by the edge of the plate may interfere

with those which pass through it, then if the plate is on the same side as the violet

space, the spectrum is seen crossed with numerous black and nearly equidistant bands,

parallel to Fraunhofer's fixed lines, and, generally speaking, increasing with the thin-

ness of the plate ; but if the plate is on the same side as the red space, no bands

whatever are seen, though all the other conditions of their production are the same.

When the transparent plate is very thin the fringes of thin plates are produced,

whether we cover the half or the whole of the pupil ; but these have nothing to do

with the phaenomenon under cofisideration. The singular fact of the fringes being

seen only in one position of the plate appeared to me to indicate a new polarity in the

simple elements of light. I therefore communicated it to the British Association at

Liverpool, in 1836 ; and in 1837 I submitted to the same body additional observa-
tions, which excited some discussion. The singular phaenomena contained in these

notices, though pressed upon the attention of the supporters of the undulatory

theory, remained unexplained for more than three years. They at last attracted the

regard of Prof. Airy, in October 1839, when that distinguished mathematician re-
peated my experiments ; and in 1840 he made them the subject of an elaborate me-
moir, constituting the Bakerian Lecture of that year, entitled, ' On the Theoretical
Explanation of an apparent New Polarity in Light.' [Sir D. Brewster read the parts

of Prof. Airy's paper which could be readily understood by the Section.] Previous

to the publication of this ingenious paper. Prof. Airy gave an account of it at the

meeting of the British Association in Glasgow, in 1839. On that occasion I made

a few observations upon it ; but specially marking the fact, that whereas Prof. Airy's
          --

8 REPORT-- 1845.

explanation referred solely to very faint bands seen when the spectrum was out of
focus, I had seen the bands perfectly distinct, and most vivid and intensely black,
when the spectrum was in focus. The explanation, therefore, given in this memoir
had nothing to do with the bands which I had discovered and described. Prof. Airy
was accordingly led to resume the investigation ; and he has published the results
of it in a Supplement to his first paper, which appeared in the Philosophical Trans-
actions for 1840. The following is the account which he gives of the results which

he obtained :

    "In the Second Part," says Prof. Airy, " of the Transactions for 1840, the Royal
Society has published a memoir by me, explaining on the undulatory theory of
light the apparent new polarity discovered by Sir D. Brewster, which explanation
is based on the assumption that the spectrum is viewed out of focus ; an assumption
which corresponded to the circumstances of my own observations, and to those of some
other persons. Since the publication of that memoir, I have been assured by Sir D.
Brewster that the phcenomenon was most certainly observed with great distinctness,
when the spectrum was viewed so accurately in focus that many of Fraunhofer's

finer lines could be seen. This observation appeared to be contradictory to those of

Mr. Talbot, cited by me in p. 226 of my memoir, as well as to my own. With the view

of removing the obscurity that still appeared to embarrass this subject, I have con-
tinued the theoretical investigations for that case which was omitted in the former

memoir, namely, when the spectrum is viewed in focus, or when a=0 ; and I have

arrived at a result which appears completely to reconcile the seemingly conflicting

--statements." Phil. Trans. 1841, p. 1,

   Now, in the investigations which this paper contains, and which Prof. Airy con-
siders satisfactory, there are two points which require special attention. Theirs/ of
these is the assumption, necessary for the explanation, that even when any single
point of the spectrum is seen accurately in focus, it forms a diffused image on the

retina, the extent of the diffusion being exceedingly less than the interval between the

bands. The supposition appears to me quite untenable, and one which cannot for

--a moment be admitted. The second point relates to the expression of -- , which

Prof. Airy obtains for the interval between the bands ; from which it follows, that
this interval is inversely as the radius of the pupil, or the area of the object-glass.
But the intervals have no such relation, and Prof. Airy does not say that such a re-
lation was ever noticed in any of his experiments. I have made the experiment re-
peatedly and carefully, and can state with confidence that the fringes do not vary
ivith the diameter of the pupil or the apertures of the object-glass. Their interval re-
mains the same, whether we look through a pin-hole or with the pupil in its fullest
expansion ; and it is equally invariable when the aperture of the object-glass is made
to vary from a quarter of an inch to four inches. Hence it follows that the system
of bands to which Mr. Airy's theory is applicable has no existence in nature ; that
the phaenomena which I discovered are still unexplained by the undulatory theory,

and may still be regarded as indicative of a new species of polarity, till they are
brought under the dominion of some general principle. Since the publication of the
two memoirs of Prof. Airy, I have devoted much time to the examination and mea-

 surement of the bands under consideration, and I have been led to the observation
of many new and complex pha;nomena. [Sir D. Brewster read an account of these

new pheenomena.] I am still, however, as ignorant as ever of the cause of the sin-

 gular property to which this notice relates, though I have succeeded in tracing the
 phaenomena to the true class of interferences to which they belong.

                     Notice of Two New Properties of the Retina.
           By Sir David Brewster, F.R.S.L. ^ E., Hon. M.R.I. A.

    One of these properties related to the inferior sensibility of the retina at that part
 of it which corresponds to the Foramen centrale of Soemmering, and which opens
 itself only when the eyes are directed to a faintly illuminated surface. The other
 property of the retina appeared after the observer's eye had been impressed with the
 luminous stripes seen by looking out of a railway carriage in rapid motion at the
stones, or other white bodies lying near the rails. When the eye is quickly shut

under this impression, a motion is perceived in a direction transverse to the real im-

pression on the retina ; and there is the appearance of lines complementary in the

same transverse direction.  _^____

On the Aberration of Light. By the Rev. Professor Challis, M.A.

The phsenomenon of aberration was explained by assuming the direction of vision

Ato be always coincident with the direction of the propagation of light.  star, ac-

cording to this supposition, is seen in its proper direction, while an object which

moves with the spectator is seen in a direction which, with respect to the earth's mo-

tion, is behind its true place. Astronomical observation does not determine whether

aberration affects the apparent position of the wire of the telescope, or of the star.

Assuming the position of the star to be changed, it follows from this view, that the

star must be considered to be in advance of its true place as regards the direction of

the earth's motion, and this result is in accordance with the principle on Avhich cor-

rections for aberration are applied in astronomical calculations.

               On the Aberration of Light. By G. G. Stokes, M.J.

   In this paper the author adopts the undulatory theory of light. He supposes that

the luminiferous aether is displaced by the motion of the earth and planets through
it, in a manner similar to that in which ordinary fluids are displaced by solids moving

through them, though not necessarily according to the same laws. He supposes

that the aether close to the surface of the earth is at rest relatively to that surface,
being entangled in the earth's atmosphere. Consequently, experiments on reflexion,

refraction, and interference, made with the light coming from any particular star,
will lead to the same result at whatever time of year they are made, conformably
with experiment. He supposes that light is propagated through the sether in motion
in the same way that sound is propagated through air in motion ; that is to say, he
supposes that the displacement of a small portion of a wave's front in a very short
time is compounded of the displacement which would exist if the aether were at rest,
and of the displacement of the aether itself, so that in general the direction of a
normal to that portion of the wave's front is changed by the motion of the aether.
The law of aberration which results from this supposition is complicated, so long as
we suppose the motion of the aether arbitrary ; but if we suppose its motion such

that udx-\-vdy-^wdz is an exact differential, where wu, v, are the resolved parts

along the rectangular axes of x, y, z, of the velocity of the particle of aether whose
coordinates are x, y, z, then the law of aberration which is derived from the theory
coincides with the law which is the result of observation (Philosophical Magazine,
July 1845).

On the Rings which surround the Image of a Star formed by the Object-glass
                    of a Telescope. By the Kev. S. Earnshaw.

   The object is to draw the attention of persons, who take an interest in optical

phaenomena and their theoretical explication, to the fact, that the rings which are
ordinarily seen round the image of a'star are not the whole of the phsenomenon opti.
cally due to the experiment. If a point of sunlight be substituted for the star, ad-
ditional parts become visible, which before were not appreciable by the eye on account
of the feebleness of the light emitted by the star. If the experiment be varied (as was
done by Fraunhofer and Sir John Herschel) by placing an annular aperture before
the object-glass, two remarkable changes take place; viz. a great increase in the
number of rings seen round the central spot, and the spreading of a diflfused light
over the field of view. The diffusion is not uniform, but the brightness decreases
from the centre to a minimum, then increases to a maximum ; then it decreases to
a minimum, and so on. The black rings occur at tolerably equal intervals, within
the part comprehended by the first ring of minimum brightness just spoken of. The
two circumstances which attend the substitution of an annular aperture for a com-
plete circular aperture were pointed out as phsenomena for which the undulatory
theory has hitherto been unable to account, though the attempt has been made by
one who has been perhaps more successful than any other person in applying the
methods and principles of that theory to observed phaenomena.

  A reference was also made to Fraunhofer's experiments with annular' apertures,

for the purpose of remarking that, on account of the narrowness of his annuli and
the low power of his telescope, it was not possible for him to observe some part of
the pliEenomenon seen by Sir John Herschel ; while, on account of the feebleness of
starlight, the latter experimenter was not able to see the whole as a single phaeno-
menon, but was induced, by the imperfection of the image presented by his telescope,
to refer the two portions which he did see to distinct causes. There can be no doubt
however upon the mind of an observer, who employs sunlight, that the rings and
halos are parts of a certain phaenomenon, the whole of which is due to one cause
and as such must be both included in the explanation of theory, before the theory
can be said to have succeeded. The author considers that its not having been able
to include these two parts in one investigation, is a sufficient proof that either the
investigation is defective, or the theory in some of its details erroneous.

An Improvement in the Method of taking Positive Talbotypes {Calotypes).
         By Sir David Brewster, F.R.S. L. ^ E., Hon. M.R.I.A.

In the method now in use the face of the negative Talbotype is placed directly

upon the side of the paper which has been brushed over with a solution of nitrate,

or ammonia-nitrate, of silver, and which is to receive the positive picture. In strong

sunlight the picture is thus taken very quickly ; but there is a roughness in the

shades, owing to the formation of black specks, which destroys the softness of the

picture, and in portraits gives a disagreeable harshness to the human face. In

order to remove this defect, the author first interposed thin plates of glass, with their

surfaces sometimes ground and sometimes polished ; but, though the divergency or

diffusion of the light, passing through the negative picture, produced great softness

in the positive, yet the outlines were too indistinct, though the Talbotypes looked very

well, when placed at a distance. He then tried the effect of interposing a sheet of

writing paper, without the water-mark and of uniform texture. The result of this

experiment fully answered his expectations. The diffusion of the light thus occa-

sioned shaded off, as it were, all the sharp lines and points, and gave a high degree

of softness to the picture. The effect was even improved by interposing two sheets

of clean paper ; and, with a very bright meridian sun, he found that three sheets

Amay be used with advantage.  similar effect may be obtained, in a smaller degree,

by placing the hack of the negative upon the positive paper, so as to cause the light

to traverse the thickness of the negative, and this may be combined with one or more

sheets of clean paper. This, of course, will be appropriate only with portraits'; and

it has the advantage (sometimes required) of making the figure look another way.
To those who see the experiments above described for the first time, the effect is
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,  11

almost magical. When the negative is removed, we see only a blank sheet of
·white paper ; and our surprise is very great when, upon lifting this sheet, we dis-

cover beneath it a perfect picture, which seems as it were to have passed through
the opake and impervious screen. Sir D. Brewster exhibited specimens of portraits
produced in this manner, and also specimens produced by the transmission of light
through two perfectly coincident negatives of different degrees of strength ; together
with specimens of positives produced by placing the positive paper between two
perfectly coincident negatives, and acted upon by light incident on both sides of the
picture. Sir D. Brewster mentioned some unexpected theoretical results which these

experiments indicated, but which required further investigation.

                 On the Elementary Laws of Statical Electricity.
              By William Thomson, B.A., St. Peters College.

   The author, after noticing the labours of Coulomb, Poisson, and Green, on this
subject, observes that of late years some eminent experimentalists, and especially
Harris and Faraday, have begun to doubt, to a certain extent, the truth of Cou-
lomb's laws, and have entered upon the investigation of various phsenomena which
appeared to be incompatible with them. The principal subject of this paper is an
attempt to show that almost all the results adduced in their memoirs, which refer
to electricity in equilibrium, are necessary consequences of the mathematical theory,

and that none are at variance with it.
    In the first part of the paper a number of laws of a very simple nature, arrived

at by Harris, are shown to be approximate results of Coulomb's theory. There is,
however, one part of Mr. Harris's investigations, that which refers to the " striking
distance" or to the insulating power of the atmosphere, which, though it does not
bear directly upon the laws of statical electricity, is yet of great importance in enabling
us to fix upon an absolute standard of electrical density or intensity. The result
which Mr. Harris arrives at is, that the intensity necessary to produce a spark de-
pends solely upon the density of the air, being otherwise independent of the pressure
and temperature.

    In the second part of the paper Faraday's researches on electro-statical induction
are considered, and it is attempted to show that the theory there developed is one of
two elementary methods of viewing the pheenomena of statical electricity, or in fact
 generally, of attraction varying inversely as the square of the distance. Either of
these views, one of which has presented itself to Coulomb, and the other to Faraday,

may be made the foundation of the present mathematical theory, and therefore, as
far as this is concerned, they may be adopted indifferently. It must be admitted,
however, that for simplicity of conception the elementary laws of Coulomb have
 great advantage, and from them, by very simple analysis, given first by Green, we

 arrive at the elementary laws of Faraday, as theorems.
    Faraday's memoir also contains the account of an investigation which brings to

 light a very remarkable electrical action, which he terms that of dielectrics, hitherto
 entirely unknown (if we except the observation of Nicholson, that the dissimulating
 power of a Leyden phial depends on the kind of glass of which it is made, as well as
 on the thickness) . In the present paper a short account of the results of these re-
 searches of Faraday is given, and their relation with the general theory explained.
 The laws of the dielectric action have not yet been fully determined by experiment,

 but it seems probable that it may be perfectly assimilated to that of soft iron when
 under the influence of magnetic bodies. An extensive and rigorous series of expe-

 riments and measurements would however be required to establish this or any other
 hypothesis on the subject, but still the idea might be adopted to indicate the na-
 ture of the experiments from which it would receive its most decided test.

     There are, besides, some remarkable questions relative to the physical state of
  dielectrics, which present themselves as objects for experimental inquiry. Thus it
 may be conceived that a dielectric in motion might present properties analogous to
  those discovered by Arago in magnetism, and exhibited in his experiment of the re-
  volving disc. As however a very distinct element, that of electrical currents, enters
  in the latter case in a waj' which could probably have no analogy in the former, it
  could hardly be expected that any remarkable agreement of the phsenomena pre-
  sented by the bodies in motion should be found to exist.
--12 REPORT 1845.

    Another question, which can only be decided by experiment, is whether a trans-
parent dielectric in a highly polarised state affects light transmitted in the same
manner as a uniaxal crystal*. All analogy would certainly lead us at least to look
for such an action in a plate of glass of which the particles are kept in a constrained
state by means of opposite electrical charges on the two faces, especially when we
consider that the constraint may be elevated to such an extent as to make the sub-
stance be on the point of cracking.

   Before concluding this abstract, it may perhaps be permitted to call attention to
another object of experimental research. All the measurements of Coulomb have
been made solely for the purpose of comparing electrical forces with one another,
but to complete the theory, we should have the means of comparing electrical forces

with weights, to which every other kind of force is ultimately referred. For this
purpose a standard intensity must be chosen, and the diminution of atmospheric pres-
sure at a point of conducting surface, possessing this intensity, either determined
by direct measurement, or deduced from experiments in which the repulsion between
bodies charged to a given intensity is measured by weights.

   The standard intensity is furnished by the result of Mr. Harris mentioned above,
and might be taken as the intensity immediately before a spark, in a given state of
the atmosphere. The series of experiments necessary to complete the investigation
would be of an extremely delicate nature, and might be long and laborious; but if
the result were arrived at, and if the laws of action of dielectrics were thoroughly
known, the experimental elements of the theory would be complete.

Remarks on the Periodicity of Magnetic Disturbances.

        By the Rev. H. Llo-^d, F.R.S., M.R.I.A.

  When we examine, for the first time, the chart of the changes of one of the
magnetic elements during a day of disturbance, we do not hesitate to pronounce

that the causes which produce these changes, so apparently capricious, belong to

the class which, from our ignorance of their laws, we are accustomed to denominate
" accidental " or " irregular." Experience, however, has shown that these phaeno-

mena, and therefore also the forces which produce them, are subject to laws, which

Arequire multiplied observations alone for their development.  few months of

systematic observation is sufficient to show that these apparently abnormal move-

ments of the magnet recur more frequently at certain hours of the day than at others.

Prof. Kreil seems to have been the first to notify this remarkable fact. In a letter

addressed to M. KupfFer, dated in January 1839, he observes, that "all hours of

the day do not appear to be equally favourable to the development of this_ phseno-

menon ;" that disturbances begin "much more frequently in the evening than in

the morning hours," and "hardly ever begin in the latter hours of the forenoon."

In a letter addressed to Col. Sabine, dated in July 1840, Prof. Kreil has entered

more minutely into the question, with the light of the observations of an additional
year. He there observes, that " the least disturbance takes place in the declination

from 8 to 10 a.m., and the greatest from 8 to 10 p.m. ;" that "the declination is

increased by the disturbances of the forenoon and middle of the day, and diminished

by those occurring in the evening hours ;" that the effect of disturbances upon the

horizontal intensity is, in general, a diminution of that element, this diminution
being however more considerable " during the hours of the night and morning, than

in the forenoon and afternoon."

  A more elaborate examination of this question has been since made by Col. Sabine,

in the discussion of the results of the first two years' observations, made at the Mag-

netic Observatory of Toronto, under the direction of Lieut. Riddell. The mode of

examination is, for the most part, the same as that of Prof. Kreil, namely, to sepa-

rate the individual results, which differ from the monthly mean, correspondmg to the

same hour, by a quantity exceeding a certain arbitrary limit ; to treat them as the

effects of perturbing causes ; and to examine \he frequency of their occurrence at the

posed and examined experimentally the question here suggested, arriring only at negative
results. See ' Experimental Researches,' § 955.

several hours of regular observation. By this mode of examination Col. Sabine has

--been led to the result a result partly agreeing with, and partly differing from that de-
--duced by Prof. Kreil that " the causes which produce easterly deflections have their

maximum frequency of effect at ten hours, and those which occasion the westerly de-

flections their maximum at twenty hours. The minimum of both occurs nearly at

the same hour, viz. about two or four hours." Analogous conclusions are deduced

respecting the disturbances of the horizontal intensity. These disturbances, which

are on the whole subtractive, have their minimum at 4 p.m., the hour of maximum

intensity; their maximum, on the other hand, occurs about the time of the nocturnal

minimum of the intensity, or from ten to sixteen hours. Col. Sabine then proceeds

to compare the monthly means at the several hours of observation, as deduced from

the whole body of the observations, and as deduced from the remaining observations,

when the excessive deflections already referred to are laid aside. Of the propriety

of this separation, and of the results thence deduced. Dr. Lloyd said that he would

not now speak, as the remarks which he had to offer had no immediate connexion

with that question. With respect to an annual period in these remarkable phseno-

mena. Prof. Kreil and Col. Sabine have arrived at different conclusions. According
to Prof. Kreil, " the perturbations are much more frequent in the winter than in

the summer months ;" and that, not merely because the cause which produces the

regular diurnal change is then more feeble, but also because (according to Prof. Kreil)

the disturbing forces are then actually of greater intensity. According to Col. Sabine,
" the disturbances [of declination] appear to be distributed throughout the year with-

out any marked inequality either as to number or direction," except that their num-

ber appears to preponderate somewhat in the month of October. With respect to

the horizontal intensity. Col. Sabine appears to agree with Prof. Kreil, and to find

that the number of observed disturbances 6f that element is greater in the winter than

in the summer months.

Having thus stated the conclusions which have been hitherto drawn, in connexion

with this subject. Dr. Lloyd proceeded to lay before the Section the results to which

he had himself arrived, by a different mode of investigation, as applied to the obser-

vations made in the magnetical observatory of Dublin.

The problem which he proposed to himself had for its object to determine the law

--of probability of disturbances, as dependent upon the hour of the day, and upon the

season of the year a question the solution of which will be seen to be of very great

importance with reference to any physical theory of the phsenomenon. The methods

hitherto applied, although they indicate in a genera) manner the times of greater and

less disturbance, do not solve this question. In the investigations of Prof. Kreil

and Col. Sabine, no account is taken except of disturbances exceeding a certain

arbitrary limit ; and, with respect to these, the results are not combined in such a

manner as to give the law in question. The deduction of this laAV, although some-

Wewhat laborious, is nevertheless simple in principle.  have only to take the differ-

ences between each individual result and the monthly mean corresponding to the same

hour, and to combine these in the same manner as the errors of observation (to which

they are analogous) are combined in the calculus of probabilities. Thus, the square

root of the mean of the sum of the squares of these differences is a quantity ana-

logous to the mean error, in the partial observations of a constant quantity ; and the

probable disturbance at any hour is inferred from this, by multiplying it by a constant

factor. The values of this function (which Dr. Lloyd proposed to call the mean dis-

turbance) have been deduced for the several hours of observation in each month.

The corresponding values for the entire year are deduced from those of the separate

months, by a repetition of the same process ; they are given, reduced to minutes of

arc, in the following table :

inspection of these numbers, or, still better, by projecting them in a curve, that
the mean disturbance follows a law of remarkable regularity, as depending upon the

hour of the day. During the day, i. e. from 18 to 6 hours, it is nearly constant.
At 6 hours, i. e. at the time of mean sunset, it begins to increase ; it arrives at a
maximum a little after 10 hours ; it then decreases with the same regularity, and is

reduced to its constant day value, at about 18 hours, i. e. at sunrise. The maximum

vahie at night is about double of the constant day value.

   The function whose values have been hitherto considered is independent of the
direction of the disturbance. If, however, we take the sum of the squares of the

easterly and westerly deviations separately, it is found that the easterly disturbance

preponderates during the night, and the westerly during the day, the former being

much more considerable than the latter, and the difference reaching a maximum

about 10 hours.

It thus appears that the tendency to disturbance observes a regular period, both in

magnitude and direction, connected witli the diurnal movement. In order to perceive

their relation to the regular diurnal variations, it will be necessary to regard the latter

in a somewhat different point of view from that in which they have been usually
considered. From the very small amount of the regular change of declination, which

takes place during the night, and from the manifest connexion of the day movement

with the position of the sun. Dr. Lloyd said, that he was led to consider the position

of the magnet during the night as its normal position, from which it was made to

deviate during the day by the influence of the sun. In this point of view, the re-

gular diurnal progression may be described, in its main features, as a westerly devia-

tion of the north end of the magnet, commencing about an hour after sunrise, reach-

ing its maximum a little after 1 p.m., and thence diminishing until a few hours after

Nowsunset, when the magnet returns nearly to its normal position.   the mean

disturbance, it will be remarked, observes a period nearly the reverse of this, both in

magnitude and direction ; its value being nearly constant during the day, while it is

largely developed during the night, in a direction opposed to that of the regular day

movement. From these remarkable relations, which hold also between the changes,

regular and irregular, of the horizontal intensity, it seems evident that the two

classes of phsenomena are physically connected. Without entering into the question

of the mode of this connexion. Dr. Lloyd said that he regarded the disturbance of the

two elements (in part at least) as an irregular reaction from the regular day move-

ment, and dependent upon it both for its periodical character and for its amount.

If this hypothesis be a just one, it will of course follow that the magnitude of the

mean disturbance will vary in some direct proportion to the daily range, and should

Nowtherefore be greater in summer than in winter.  this (which is contrary to the

results deduced by Prof. Kreil and Col. Sabine, with reference to the frequency of
disturbances exceeding a certain limit) appears to be the fact. If we calculate the

mean disturbance of the declination for the several quarters of the year, we find it to

be as follows :

                     Spring.  Summer.  Autumn.             Winter.
                     2'-66     3'-02     2'-52              l'-80.

From these results, it appears that the mean disturbance observes an annual as well
as a diurnal period ; its maximum occurring in summer, its minimum in winter, while
in spring and autumn its values are nearly equal. This important relation appears

to confirm, in a remarkable manner, the views above given.
   It by no means necessarily follows, from the results above stated, that the perio-

dical character necessarily belongs to all disturbances. It may be that there are two

classes of disturbances, the results of distinct physical causes, of which one observes

a period, while the other is wholly irregular; for it is obvious that on such an hy-
pothesis, the period of the former would necessarily be impressed upon the resultant
disturbance, and that the latter would have no effect in effacing it, provided the ob-

servations from which it was inferred were sufficiently numerous. There are many
circumstances which seem to render this supposition highly probable ; and if it be
established, the next step in the investigation will be to distinguish these two kinds

of disturbances by their external characters, and to resolve the complex resultant,
where they happen to be combined, into its more simple elements. Dr. Lloyd stated
that he had commenced a series of observations in Dublin, upon a plan which seemed

On Ihe Results of the Magnetic and Meteorological Observations at General
   Sir Thomas M. Brisbane's Observatory, at Makerstoun, in the year 1842.
   By J. A. Broun.

   The following are the points of chief importance in the paper. From a comparison
of five months, iri 1841, with the corresponding five months of 1842, the yearly
movement of the north end of the declination magnet is about five minutes towards
the east. The horizontal component of the earth's magnetic intensity increases, and
the vertical component diminishes considerably in the year ; the diminution of

magnetic dip being about five minutes. A new method has been adopted in order

to obtain the temperature corrections for the bifilar and balance magnets ; it is
described in the sixteenth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh. It was mentioned that very consistent results had been obtained by dif-

ferent methods of comparison of the usual observations for the positions and tem-

peratures of the magnets. When the observations of the balance magnetometer are

corrected by this method, the diurnal range of the vertical intensity has been found,

like that for the horizontal intensity and declination, to increase regularly from the
winter months to the summer months. The annual period of the horizontal inten-

sity, as deduced from thecorrected observations of the bifilar magnetometer for 1842, is
striking ; a minimum of intensity occurs before or about each equinox, and a maxi-

mum before or about each solstice. The observations at Toronto in Canada, in 1842,

when corrected by the same method, indicate exactly the same periods. The monthly
means for Makerstoun and Toronto were projected in curves, which were exhibited
the two curves were almost identical, the increase of horizontal intensity being
greatest in the end of the year at Makerstoun. The jorrected observations of the
balance magnetometer confirm in some sense the results from the bifilar, inasmuch
as they also show the same annual periods of maxima and minima for the vertical
intensity. As a severe test of the accuracy of the instruments and the methods
adopted, the results for the magnetic dip deduced from the two force magnetometers
were compared, both as to diurnal and yearly change of dip, with the results obtained
from the inclinometer, and they were found to agree very nearly. From the meteoro-
logical observations, it was found that the range of the monthly means of the pres-
sure of dry air was nearly the same as for the moist air. The mean of the three-
monthly maxima and minima of temperature for each quarter of the year, was found
to differ only by a fractional part of a degree from the mean of all the daily maxima
and minima for the same period. The mean of the monthly maxima and minima of
atmospheric pressure is less than the mean pressure for the whole year. This, it is

conceived, has been found to hold always true, at least for places within the latitudes

--50° and 60° north ; the reverse probably takes place in lower latitudes it does so

at Pekin ; in 1841, the means of the monthly maxima and minima being in almost
every month above the mean pressure. The curve of the relative humidity of the
atmosphere for the year, deduced from the observations of the psychrometer, was
shown to agree completely in its inflexions with the curve of the mean quantity of

clouds covering the sky, this quantity being merely estimated.

                               On a large Magnetic Machine.
By the Rev. William Scoresby, D.D.,F.R.S.L. Sf E,, Cor. Mem. Inst. France.

    The principal part of the machine consists of two cases, or fasciculi of magnetic
 bars, of unusually large dimensions, on principles developed in the author's recent

--work, entitled ' Magnetical Investigations,' which principles may be thus summarily

stated : 1. That magnetic bars designed for large combinations may be conveniently
constructed of various pieces. 2. That the separation of a long bar, say of three or
four feet, into several portions, is not disadvantageous in regard to power ; and that the
resulting power is similar, whether, in the combining of several series of short bars,
the elementary bars be of the same or of unequal lengths. 3. That the relative
·powers of magnets, whether single or compound, when different in mass, but pro-
--IG REPORT 1845.

portional in all their dimensions, are not in the ratio of the masses, the large masses

being less strong proportionally than the smaller. 4. That whilst magnets of large

dimensions are less powerful with respect to their masses than small magnets to
which they are exactly proportional in all their dimensions ; and whilst the increase

of the dimensions continually deteriorates from the energy due to the mass yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

magnets may be combined in such proportional dimensions with a constant increase

of power ad infinitum. From this last result, it follows that magnets indefinitely
small must be indefinitely strong ; and may indicate that the mutually attractive
forces of the ultimate magnetic elements may be as strong as that by which the me-

tallic elements are themselves combined. It must also be kept in mind that the

steel should be perfectly hard ; and the elementary plates of the magnet should be
made of steel, converted out of one or other of the very best qualities of foreign iron.

All the conditions, with the exception of thinness, were attended to in the large

Amagnet constructed by Dr. Scoresby.  magnet on this principle, of the size of the

lower mast of.a first-rate ship of war (which might be constructed of plates of very

hard cast iron), would produce a deviation of nearly I'at the distance of a mile, and
a sensible effect much beyond that. The two fasciculi of Dr. Scoresby's magnetical

machine were about 4 feet in length each, A\ inches in breadth, and about 6 inches

in depth. Nearly 600 running feet of steel, in 504 bars, were originally provided,

weighing altogether 750 lbs.; but many were rejected, not being found hard enough

to stand the magnetic test. The attractive force, though not a favourable arrange-

ment for sustaining weight, was sufficient to carry 400 lbs. The inductive energy

on iron bars or keys, held at 6 to 12 inches distance, was extraordinary, sufficient to

sustain a chain of six keys of considerable size. With a deal board of 0*4 inch in-

terposed betwixt the magnet and the conductor, a weight of 15 lbs. was sustained.

The following electrical effects were produced by Dr. Scoresby's magnet with a

very imperfect armature. It decomposed water rapidly, producing about one cubic

inch of the gases a minute ; with about sixty-five yards of coiled wire, the effer-

vescence seemed as violent as during the action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc.

Copper was deposited from a solution of sulphate of copper at the rate of about 1*2

grains per minute. Shocks were powerful, and scintillations were thrown out ; and
sparks were visible in daylight, and emitted audible sounds when the armature re-

volved so slowly as once in sixteen seconds.-

   On the Baron de Bode's Insulated Compass. By Joseph York Oliver.

   The object was to insulate the compass from the action of the iron of the ship.
The contrivance was this : a double glass bowl, the intermediate space being filled
with mercury, was made to act as the bowl of the ordinary compass. It was hung
in gymbals, and surrounded by lead for protection. The author remarked on the
utility of employing a similar apparatus for securing chronometers from the local

attraction of the iron on shipboard. ^_^_^^

On a Method of suspending a Ships Compass. By E. J. Dent, F.R.A.S.

   An account of this instrument was communicated to the Association at its last
meeting in York. Mr. Dent now read extracts from a report of the working of this

compass during six months at sea, as ordered by the Lords of the Admiralty, to
the effect that his compass was found " to be extremely sensitive, moving exactly
and admirably with the ship's head, when the helm was put hard-a-port and hard-
a-starboard ; while the other compasses with which it was compared were always

in arrear."

   Mr. Saxby was of opinion that it will be found, on examining the direction of the
various mountain ridges of the globe, that there is a remarkable angular coincidence
between such line of direction and the local curve of equal magnetic variation, the
one crossing the other at angles of from 65° to 70°.

On the amount of Rain which had fallen, with the different winds, at Toonta-
   vara, in the County of Limerick, during five consecutive years. By the
   Rev. Thomas Knox, M.R.I.A.

The Rev. H. Lloyd said that he had already brought before the Section, at a former

meeting, the results of these observations, while in progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                         he had now the plea-

sure, at Mr. Knox's desire, of submitting to its notice the conclusions derived from

the entire and completed series of five years' uninterrupted observation. After ex-

plaining briefly the principle of the instrument, by which the amount of rain with

different winds" is measured by Mr. Knox, and the mode in which the results are

graphically represented, he proceeded to read the following remarks, in the words of

the author himself:

"There are one or two points to which I wish to draw attention. First of all,

taking the average monthly rain at three inches, the first six months of the year are

below the average, the other six months above it. November and July are by far

the two wettest months in the year, and in each the greatest amount of rain is from
S.W. April is niuch the driest month, and there is nearly as much rain in it from

the northern portion of the compass as from the southern.

   " With regard to the gross amount which fell from each point in the entire year,
that which fell from S., S.W. and W., is much above the average ; from the other

points it is below it. If the polygon which characterizes the yearly rain be divided

by a line running N.E. and S.W., then the rain at equal intervals on either side of

this line is equal, to all but a fraction of an inch. This is the more remarkable, as

these two points had been fixed on by Professor Dove, in his paper on the Winds,

as being  the  points  of greatest  and  least  barometric  pressure                                                                                                                                                                                                                  that is to  say, the
                                                                                                           ;

wind being supposed at S.W., any shift of it either towards S. or W. produces a rise

of the barometer, and also any shift on either side of N.E. a corresponding fall.
Now, in the rain, the greatest amount is from S.W., corresponding with the least

height of the barometer : the least is from N.E., where also the barometer is highest

and on either side of this line it varies regularly. For instance, the amounts from

W. and S. are nearly equal, and both less than that from S.W. : N.W. and S.E, are

also equal, but still less ; and so on.
   " There is one particular in which this separation of the gross amount of rain into

the eight portions, as brought by different winds, maybe useful, viz. in ascertaining

the respective specific gravities, and the amount of saline matter, brought from each

direction. This may be useful in regard to agricultural matters. For instance, we

could easily suppose a case of two portions of land, not many miles asunder, but on

different sides of a high range of hills, getting very different amounts of salt, from

one being exposed to, and the other sheltered from that wind in which the greatest

amount was found. But by this mode of collecting the rain, an accurate mode of

estimating this is within our reach. To this question, namely, the amounts of solid

and gaseous matter brought in the rain from each direction, 1 hope on a future oc-

casion to turn my attention."

The Tables which accompany this communication give the amount of the. rain

corresponding to each wind, for each separate month in the five years. The follow-

ing are the yearly mean results, deduced from the whole series :

   The Meteorological Thermometer Stand, which was regularly used at the author's

--observatory in Bath, was stated to possess the following requisites : It can be placed

on any open eligible spot. Its four sides can and must be placed to face the cardinal

points; commanding, therefore, a true north and south aspect. It can be visited on

every side, and be free from all surrounding objects. The instruments or thermo-

meters used can be read off with great facility ; and the whole will be at a known

distance from the ground. The instruments placed on the south face will have the

meridian sun ; and those on the north face will be always in the shade, in conse-

quence of the projecting wings. It can be employed by anv meteorologist wherever

                            On Fog-rings observed in America.
           By Sir David Brewster, F.R.S.L. ^ E., Hon. M.R.I. A.

   This notice was communicated to Sir D. Brewster by Sir John P. Boileau. It
relates to a fog-bow which had been seen in January 1808, by Sir George Rose,
when off the Montgomery Reach, in the Potomac, in Virginia. Early in the morn-
ing a milk-white fog came on, so thick that the captain of the packet founa it neces-
sary to anchor, not knowing where he was. About half-past eleven he came up to
Sir George, and remarked that they should have all clear soon, "for the fog-eater
was come." The captain explained himself by pointing to the head of the vessel,
where there was visible a ring of thicker white fog than that in which they were en-
veloped, apparently about sixty feet in diameter, the belt of the ring appearing about
two feet broad. Within this ring was another, two feet in diameter, suspended in
its centre, and with prismatic colours. It lasted about 20' or 30', after which the
fog cleared away. There was a severe frost on the following day.

Tables of Meteorological Observations for the Year 1 844, made by i.K. Crowe,
  Esq., the British Consul-General of Norway at Christiana. Latitude

   59" 54' 1" North, Longitude 10° 45' O" East.

(Communicated by Dr. Lee.) [These Tables are a continuation of others made

in the year 1843, and presented to the British Association at York, and noticed in

the volume of the Proceedings of the Association for 1844, at p. 27 of the abstracts

of communica'aoiis to the Section of Mathematics and Physics.]

They consist of observations of the thermometer and barometer made on every day

in the year, at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., with the means of each
column for each month, and the mean temperature calculated for each month, and

the quantity of rain in cubic inches.

Also tables of the prevailing winds for each month, the sixteen directions of the

winds being noted for 9 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on each day, and the totals for each

month. Id February, the state of the wind is also given at 4 p.m. in addition.

The daily calculations for December are  not  complete                                            those for the ] 1th to the

20th inclusive are wanting. But the barometrical and thermometrical means for

the whole month at the five above-mentioned hours are given, and the tables of the

prevailing winds are calculated for 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.

   The following notice was also communicated by Dr. Lee :

A Description of the Lightning and Thunder of the 16th of August 1844,

   which took place at Alten, in Norwegian Lapland, by 3 . F. Cole, Esq,

  + +N. T^atitude 69° 50' and Longitude 23° East.

   Mr. Cole is the gentleman who, in 1 844, presented a paper on the Aurora Borealis,
as seen frequently at Alten ; also a paper on a sudden fall of rain, with a clear sky,
at Alten ; also a paper, or table, on the Forces and Directions of the Winds, the
Barometer and Thermometer, &c. &c.

   Dr. Lee remarked, on presenting these two papers, that although of inferior value
compared to many which have been presented to the Section, still that they were
not without some interest, as being a continuation of the series of papers which had
arrived from Norway and Lapland in 1844, and which are likely to be continued in

future years.

   Any observations from Alten are interesting, on account of its high northern

latitude, and being the most northern town in the world, and where it might be highly
advantageous for science that a magnetic observatory should be established, and
which might be done at present with facility, as there is a British miniug company
established at Alten, and several of the young men in the employ of the company,
hoth English and Norwegians, already have a public library and an astronomical and
meteorological observatory, and devote their leisure time to these studies, and with
due encouragement and assistance, the work of a magnetic observatory would be
materially assisted by them.

    Either Alten or Hammaifest (which is near it) would be a desirable spot for at

                                                                        c2

magnetic observatory, and as our distinguished secretary Colonel Sabine has swung
the pendulum during his important voyage in the northern seas at Hammarfest,
Dr. Lee states that his superior opinion on this subject could be consulted with

advantage.
    Also, on account of the northern position of Alten or Hammarfest, observations on

refraction might be made with great advantage, and some results obtained from them
which would be highly beneficial to astronomy.

    Alten is also the region of auroras ; they abound in that latitude, and their con-
nexion with magnetism might be traced with more advantage at Alten than at any
other place.

   During the visit of the King of Sweden and Norway to Christiana in the winter

of 1844, his Majesty is said to have expressed his readiness to give every patronage
in his power to the arts and sciences in Scandinavia, and he has already authorised
Baron Wrede and Professor Selander, the Astronomer Royal of Stockholm, to make
arrangements during the summer of 1845, for the measuring of an arc of latitude
from Tornea in the gulf of Bothnia to the North Cape during the summer of 1846,

and Baron Wrede is now engaged on that grand work.

    This is an additional reason for the establishment of a magnetic observatory at
Alten, under the patronage of the British Association, in the spring of the year 1846.

    Dr. Lee expressed his wish, that the friends of the Association would authorize
the committee to establish a series of magnetic observatories at Edinburgh, Inverness,
Thurso, the Shetland Isles, Drontheim in Norway, and Alten in Lapland, in order
that regular tables of observations might be produced from them for the benefit of
the Association.

          Researches on Shooting Stars. By M. Coulvier Gravier.

   The observations were made at Rheims and at Paris, and v.'ere continued without
intermission from July 1841 to February 1845 inclusive. The mean number seen
in an hour followed a remarkable lav/ of progression throughout the year. The
hourly mean number for January was 3'6, for February 3'6, for March 3'7, for
April 37, for May 3-8, for June 3-2, for July 7-0, for August 8-5, for September 6-8,
for October 9, for November 9'5, for December 7'9 ; thus during the first six months
the hourly number is nearly the same each month, while in the next six months
there is a progressive increase, first until August, and then until October or Novem-
ber, periods at which the hourly number is more than double those of the other six
months, which well agrees with the facts proved in those countries as to August and
November. The second part of the memoir contains tabulated results of the hourly
variations of the shooting stars observed from six in the evening to six in the morn-
ing, which also observed a remarkable progression fi'om 3" 3, the hourly mean number
observed between 6 and 7 p.m., to 8"2, the hourly mean of those seen between 5 and
6 A.M. This result was illustrated by curves, in which a very obvious law of hourly
progression was to be observed.

On Remarhahle Lunar Periodicities in Earthquakes, extraordinary Oscillations
 of the Sea, and great Atmospherical Changes. By Richard Edmonds, jun.

   The following nine days remarkable for earthquakes, extraordinary oscillations of
the sea, or very unusual states of the atmosphere, occurred near the moon's first

quarters, at successive intervals of about four lunations each.

  --1842, November 9. Earthquake at Montreal and other parts of Canada*, when

" the waters of the St. Lawrence were violently agitated." This was the day before

the moon's first quarter. On the 1 1th, the day after it, the barometer at Penzance

--was 29'00, lower than for 247 days before and 13 days afterwards.
   1843, March 10. Earthquake at Manchester^; barometer at Chiswick§ on the
preceding days 30'380, higher|| than for 49 days before and 179 days after.

 --July 5. Extraordinary oscillation of the sea in Penzance*, Plymouth, Scotland,

&c., and a great thunderstorm f throughout the island. Barometer at Penzance at
the time of the oscillation there 29'50, lower than for twenty-five days before and
forty-seven days after. Thermometer at Chiswick 88°, at Brighton 78°, the maxima

for the year at those places.

 --October 30. Similar oscillations of the sea at Penzance and Plj^mouthJ. Ba-

rometer at Penzance at the time of the oscillation 29-00, which, except the minimum

of the 27th, was lower than for 223 days before and 115 days after.

  --1844, February 26. Barometer at Chiswick 28-624, lower than for 409 days be-

fore and ever since. At Penzance it was 28-50, having fallen nearly two inches in

thirty-six hours.

 --June 23. An unusually severe and protracted thunderstorm this evening through-

out Cornwall and in Dumfries-shire, and on the following morning at Boston and
Liverpool, at which latter place "pebbles and small eels descended in the streets §."
Thermometer at Chiswick on the 23rd, 91° ; highest for the year except one day in

July. In the weekly meteorological report from the Greenwich Observatory, it is
stated as an extraordinary fact, that " at 1 o'clock p.m. (of the 23rd) a thermometer

placed on a small piece of raw wool in the sun's rays, rose in seven minutes to 155°,

--and was still rising when the thermometer was taken away."
   October 18. The town of Buffalo on Lake Erie almost destroyed by a hurricane.

This was the day of the moon's first quarter, and almost exactly twenty-four luna-
tions after the earthquake in that neighbourhood already mentioned. At Chiswick
this day the maximum of the thermometer was less by 3° than for several months
before, and the barometer on the I6th was at a minimum of 28-940, lower than since

the 26th of February.

  --1845, February 12. The greatest cold experienced in England probably during

the present century. Thermometer at Blackheath, at half past 7 a.m., 33i° below

the freezing-point ; at Chiswick 35° below that point. Barometer at the latter place

30-409, higher than for nine months before, except on the 21st of December.

 --June 13. Extraordinary oscillation of the sea in Kent||, and a "terrific" thun-

derstorm at Chatham. The temperature very high in all parts of England ; ther-
mometer at Penzance being 77°, higher than on any other day of the year hitherto If.

   Not one of the phenomena for which the above nine days are remarkable, was
forty-eight hours from the moon's first change or quarter. Three of the days
were each at the moon's first quarter nearest the solstice ; of these the first and last

were distinguished for extraordinary oscillations of the sea, while all were remark-

able for great thunderstorms and unusually warm weather**.
   The author's attention was drawn to the interval of four lunations by having re-

markedff that interval, or 118 days, between the two oscillations of the sea, at and

   * The author, who witnessed this oscillation in Mounts-bay, has given a minute description
of it in the Transactions of the Koyal Geological Society of Cornwall, 1843, p. 114, and con-
siders that such phsenomena result from submarine shocks or vibrations of the earth, which,
after being transmitted through the sea, more rapidly than sound through air, exhaust them-

selves on reaching the shore, in a succession of long waves or tide-like oscillations. See also
Jameson's Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for April 1845, pp. 271-279.

parts of Great Britain, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xv.

       This was observed at Folkstone at 4 p.m., and is thus described in the newspapers :

" The tide then flowing changed to ebbing three different and continuous times, causing
much agitation of the sea at the harbour's mouth. This had been preceded by a heavy and
brief whirlwind from the S.E. The rise of the water appeared to be about three feet, and

its sudden receding produced the agitation."

   ^ Higher than on any other day of the year except the 9th and 10th of September,
exactly three lunations afterwards, when it was 77° and 78°.

    ** So also in 1842, the hottest day of the hottest June in Boston in Lincolnshire since
1826, was the 14th, the day before the moon's first quarter, the thermometer at Chiswick

being then 88°, the same as on the 5th July 1843.

after the great earthquake of 1755, and 119 days* between those at and after the

great earthquake of 1761.
    But while such remarkable days have occurred at intervals offour lunations, others

were mentioned as having taken place at intervals of either single lunations or some
multiple of a lunation f ; and the great earthquakes throughout Mexico on the 9th
of March and the 7th of April last, are almost exactly one lunation from each other.
So also, in reference to the six knownj shocks of the earth and extraordinary oscilla-
tions of the sea in Cornwall during the last century, the interval between any two of
them is almost exactly some multiple of a lunation. The same observation applies
to the six which have occurred in the present century, except that of the 20th of
 October 1837. With this single exception they have all happened at or near the
 moon's first quarters.

    From the facts above noticed, it would appear that an earthquake or any very

 disturbed or extraordinary state of the atmosphere, is generally preceded or followed
 either by other earthquakes or by unusual states of the atmosphere occurring at
 intervals of single lunations, or of some multiple of a lunation ; and that the phae-

 nomena which happen at intervals of four lunations, are more striking than those at
 the shorter periods. There seems reason therefore for supposing that earthquakes and
 great atmospherical changes are in many, if not most instances, occasioned princi-
 pally by the action of the moon.

                  On the Nature and Origin of the Aurora Borealis.
                     By the Rev. George Fisher, M.A.,F.R.S.

    The following is an abstract of this paper, and the results which the author has
 endeavoured to establish :

     That the principal displays of the aurora occur in the vicinity of the edge or mar-
 gin of the frozen sea, and occasionally at those places in more temperate climates,
 where humid vapours are accumulated, and by the operation of certain causes, such
 as tides, winds, &c., are brought suddenly within the influence of a cold and dry
 atmosphere, and thereby subject to congelation. That the aurora is an electrical
 phaenomenon, and arises from the positive electricity developed by the congelation of
 these vapours, and the consequent induced negative electricity of the upper and
 surrounding portions of dry atmosphere. It is the accompanying indication of the
 restoration of the electrical equilibrium, which equilibrium is restored by the inter-
 vention and conducting power of minute frozen particles, which particles are rendered
 luminous by the transmission of the electricity, and thereby give rise to the various
  appearances of the phsenomena.

     From the author's observations at Winter island and at the island of Igloolik
  (the two winter stations of Capt. Parry's second expedition to the polar regions,
  which expedition he accompanied as astronomer), he was led to the conclusion that
  those places at which the aurora took its rise, were chiefly confined to the edge or
 margin of the frozen sea. He observed at each of these places, that in the early
  part of the winter, before the sea around was frozen over, the aurora was of a ge-
  neral and diffused character, and extended through the zenith in every direction.
  As the winter advanced and the edge of the ice in consequence became more remote,
  so the aurora diminished in splendour, assumed a low-arch appearance, and was

  seen only in the direction of the open-water, fringing the upper surfaces of dark-

  masses of vapours, known by the name of " Sea-blink," which hung over and were
  apparently in contact with the exposed surface of the sea. He gives additional evi-
  dence as to this particular locality of the phsenomenon from the observations of
  Captains Sir John Franklin, Beech'ey, Biscoe, and others ; and he observes, that its

     * On the last of these 119 days, when the second oscillation occui-red in Mounts-bay in
   1761,a very violent thunderstorm happened there in the evening, distant thunder having

   been heard occasionally all the day, and the weather very sultry and calm. Phil. Tram.,

usual height above the surface of the earth is very inconsiderable in high latitudes,

since it has been observed at one place in the zenith, forming a confused mass of
flashes and beams ; and at another, not many miles distant, having the appearance

of a low illumined arch in the direction of the former place.

The sudden deposition of extremely minute frozen particles, when auroral displays

took place near to the zenith, was several times observed by the author ; and it ap-

pears that the same singular fact has been alluded to by Lieut. Hood and also by

Dr. Richardson, but more especially by Professor Joslyn of New York, in Silliman's

Journal, Oct. 1838, who concludes, from numerous observations made in North Ame-

--rica, that " the aurora is an electrical phaenoraenon, that it is intimately connected

with the elements of the clouds, and with these elements onljr, when they are gene-

--rated in air intensely cold, as well as nearly saturated with humidity, that it requires
--for its development a cold adequate to the crystallization of aqueous vapours, that

crystals of snow, more minute and simple than those which produce halos, are

--always present in the atmosphere above the region of ordinary clouds during the

appearance of this meteor, that those seasons of the year, and those hours of the

night when the aurora most frequently occurs, are favourable both to the presence

and congelation of aqueous vapours in the atmosphere." The author remarks upon

the singular agreement between these results of Professor Joslyn and those commu-

nicated by himself four years before, in an unpublished paper to the Royal Society.

He considers, however, that perhaps the strongest proof of the important agency of

these particles in an auroral display, is to be derived from the fact, that the auroral
light can be distinctly traced to those localities where humid vapours are known to

be undergoing rapid congelation, and where such particles must in consequence

abound                                 and that  in  the usual arch-formation, whatever may be  the nature of the
                                    ;

light, yet the auroral fringe clearly arises from the illumination of the frozen parti-

cles which are formed from the exterior portion of the vapours, being under the in-

fluence of the cold atmosphere immediately above them. From the circumstance

that congelation is a known source of electrical development, he infers that strong

evidence is thereby afforded of the nature as well as the locality of the aurora.

Although he considers suflScient evidence was obtained as to the direction and

situation of the open-water during the winter season, from the usual indications of

the sea-blink, and also from the information obtained from the Esquimaux, yet a

singular confirmation in this respect was afforded by the circumstance, that the re-

fraction due to the star Sirius, which was usually observed through a low aurora in

the south-east direction at the island of Igloolik during the second winter, was ge-

nerally about 1' less than the corresponding refraction of the same star when ob-

served at equal altitudes and temperature towards the south-west ; in which latter

direction the visual ray passed over land covered with ice and snow, thereby indi-

cating a diminished density of the lower stratum of atmosphere in the former direc-

tion, in which the aurora was seen, from its being under the influence of the compa-

ratively higher temperature of an exposed surface of the sea.

The author remarks, that when a display of aurora commenced with the arch-

formation, the upper stratum of vapour, which formed the exterior limit or upper

edge of the arch, was usually of a very dense and dark appearance, apparently highly

charged with humidity, and exhibited by the contrast the auroral fringe immediately

above it with splendid effect ; but that the lower portion, being of a higher temperature,

from being nearer to the exposed surface of the water, became frequently so dilated

and transparent as to render stars visible within the arch.
   To form an estimate of the prodigious extent to which congelation goes on during

the winter season near the margin of the frozen sea, and at those places within it,

where, by reason of the spring tides, the ice is continually broken and separated

from the land, and the' water in consequence suddenly exposed to the action of the

low temperatures which then prevail, he observes, that a difference of more than

70° Fahr. continually occurs between the temperature of the exposed surface-water

and that of the atmosphere above it, and that the latter in consequence becomes im-

mediately impregnated with extremely minute frozen particles, known by the name
of " Frost-smoke," which, when seen at a distance, has a white silvery appear-

ance.

The immense mass of vapours which are known to accumulate near the edge of

the ice are invariably confined at this period of the year to very low altitudes above

the surface of the earth, so as never to form clouds in the usual acceptation of the

term ; but as the season advances and the temperature increases, the aurora occurs

less frequently ; the vapours become entirely detached from the sea, rise to a greater

height in the atmosphere, and begin to acquire the ordinary appearance of clouds.

The aurora is no longer confined to their upper surfaces, but a faint auroral light is

usually seen to fringe the whole of their circumferences, until the vapours are dissi-

pated by congelation. The author conceives the alternate opening and closing of the

ice, by which means different portions of vapours are detached from the surface of

the sea consecutively, give rise to the appearance of different concentric arches of

aurora, which are occasionally seen.

As extreme dryness is the peculiar character of the higher atmosphere consequent

upon low temperatures (which is a state most favourable for electrical induction),

he concludes that this portion of the atmosphere acquires an opposite state of elec-

tricity to that below ; and since there are no means, such as exist in more temperate

latitudes, of effecting the restoration of the electrical equilibrium thus disturbed by

congelation                                                       and moreover, since within  the  tropics  the  aurora  is  never seen, and
                                                               ;

thunder and lightning are of almost daily occurrence, the latter phaenomenon

indicates the means which nature employs for the maintenance of the equilibrium

nearer the equator ; and on the other hand, the aurora points out the mode by which
the same end is silently effected in the cloudless atmosphere of a polar winter, and

other places where it occasionally occurs, by the interposition and conducting power

of the frozen particles that are then and there formed ; that as these particles are

generated in the same proportion as the electricity is developed, so the means of

restoring the equilibrium are at all times adequate for the purpose.

   He considers the formation of vertical streamers to arise from the illumination of

columns of these particles in performing the office of restoring the electrical equili-

brium between the upper and lower strata of atmosphere ; that their vertical ascen-
sion is due to the electrical attraction caused by the strata being in opposite states

of electricity by induction, and in accordance with this he observed that when the

streamers were projected from an auroral arch, the fringe of light upon the latter
usually became extinct, or very much diminished in intensity. That the particles

are subsequently distributed by the winds in various directions, and give rise by

their illumination to the different places and appearances which constitute a diffused

aurora, which is usually terminated by a deposition of the particles when they have

performed their office.

He found by repeated trials, which were suggested to him by the late Sir Humphry

Davy at a committee of the Royal Society held previous to the sailing of the expe-

dition, that ice is an electrical conductor at very low, as well as at mean tempera-

tures. The experiments were made with various electrometers, and the friction

made with silk, woollen cloth, &c., but without producing the least electrical indi-

cation, although, from the perfect dryness of the atmosphere at low temperatures,

the electrometers were extremely sensible of the slightest approach of an excited

Aelectric.                                                        similar conclusion was obtained by completing, by means of ice, the

connexion in JVI. Orsteds galvanic apparatus. Mr. Fisher also observes, that the

conducting power of the frozen particles floating in the atmosphere defeated every

attempt to determine the state of the atmospherical electricity, by means of the ap-

paratus suspended from the royal mast-head of the ship, during the time they were

frozen up each winter, by reason of their deposition upon the insulating glass rods

of the copper chain used for the purpose ; and he has reason to think, had the in-

sulation been perfect, some very interesting results would have been obtained.

Taking this viewof the subject, the author considers that there exists an irregular belt

or zone of congelation, circumscribing the pole of each hemisphere, in different parts

of which displays of aurora more or less occur, according to the amount of the re-

quired conditions of low temperatures and humidity ; and that those parts of the zones

which cross the northern Atlantic, or in other words, the winter limits of the frozen

sea which extend from the American to the northern coast of Europe, will be most

favoui-able to the production of the aurora, from the circumstance of there being

there the greatest supply of humidity. This, he observes, is confirmed by observa-

tion, and is further corroborated by the fact, that gales of wind from the south, which
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  25

bring to the ice portions of atmosphere saturated with moisture from sea-weed, most
frequently accompany these auroral displays.

    Having endeavoured to trace the aurora to these localities, he concludes his paper
by identifying these auroral zones with the existence of electrical currents and their

application to the theory of terrestrial magnetism. He considers that these zones

will not approach nearer to either pole of the earth than the margin of the fixed ice,
from the absence of humidity in the atmosphere over the fixed ice ; but that they
will extend themselves indefinitely towards the equator, and also in height above the

surface of the earth. And since the general configuration or curvature of the zones
must obviously approximate to that of the isothermal lines, which latter are known
to accord in a very remarkable way with the magnetic curves, he thinks there are

good grounds for concluding that Ampere's theory is founded in truth, and that these
currents circulate within the zones from east to west ; the exciting cause of the cir-

culation of the currents in this direction being probably the action of the sun, as
each portion of the zones is brought consecutively by the diurnal rotation of the
earth within the solar influence ; the magnetic needle being thereby induced to place

itself at right angles to the direction of the currents. It will follow also, that the

electrical development in each zone will be greater in winter than in the summer of
the corresponding hemisphere ; and that the magnetic force will also be a maximum
in the winter time, which is found to be the case.

   He suggests, that upon the same principle the force soliciting the horizontal mag-
netic needle will be a minimum during that period of the day when the solar influ-

ence is most efi^ective in diminishing the electrical development in that part of the
zone which is situated in the direction of the magnetic meridian ; that the diurnal

deflection of the north end of the needle (as observed in Europe) towards the west

in the morning, and the contrary motion in the afternoon, may be also thus recon-

ciled ; and, finally, that the aurora will produce a similar effect by restoring the
electrical equilibrium, and cause a diminution of the magnetic intensity of the hori-
zontal needle when a display happens in or near the direction of the magnetic meri-
dian, and also a corresponding deflection in declination from that part of the zone
where the phsenomenon occurs. These conclusions the author has reason to believe
are confirmed by observations.

       On a Lunar Meteorological Cycle. By Luke Howard, F.R.S.

   Mr. Howard reports that the facts of the last two years compel him to modify
his anticipations as to the extent to which the lunar cycle will enable him or others
to become " weather prophets." But he says the deferred heat (to be expected from
the corresponding period of the cycle in 1825 to 1828) may prove to be only de-
feated cold ; and the absence of so great an elevation of the mean temperature now,
may spare us a repetition for many seasons to come of the cold which occurred be-
tween the years 1835 and 1840. To show, however, that causes exist for these
periodical alternations of warmth and cold, much more extended in their effects than
any which are peculiar to our own climate, he proceeds in detail to place in review
together the annual mean temperature for eighteen years (ending with 1823) at
Geneva and London. It will be seen that the two cities differ little in their climatic
or annual mean ; the more southern latitude of the former being counteracted by its

greater elevation above the sea. See Plate IV.

first at the ends, showing that part to be the weakest, we might economize the ma-
terial by making the areas of the ends larger than that of the middle, increasing the

strength from the middle both waj's towards the ends. If the areas of the ends be
to the area in the middle as the strength of a short column is to that of a long one,
we should have for a column, whose height was 24 times the breadth, the area of
the ends and middle as 13,766 to 9595 nearly. This however would make the ends
somewhat too strong, since the weakness of long columns arises from their flexure,
and increasing the ends would diminish that flexure.

   Another mode of increasing the strength of the ends would be that of preventing
flexure by increasing the dimensions of the middle.

   From the experiments, it would appear that the Grecian columns, which seldom had
their length more than about 10 times the diameter, were nearly of the form capable
of bearing the greatest weight when their shafts were uniform ; and that columns,
tapering from the bottom to the top, were only capable of bearing weights due to
the smallest part of their section, though the larger end might serve to prevent la-
teral thrusts. This last remark applies too to the Egyptian columns, the strength
of the column being only that of the smallest part of the section.

   From the two series of experiments, it appeared that the strength of a short column
is nearly in proportion to the area of the section, though the strength of the larger
one is somewhat less than in that proportion.

Experiments on the Spheroidal State of Bodies, and its /Application to Steam-

   Boilers, and on the Freezing of Water in red hot Vessels. By M. Boutigny.

    (d'Evreux.)

M. Boutigny, who made his communication in the French language, first pro-

ceeded to show that a drop of water projected upon a red-hot plate does not touch it;

but that a repulsive action is exerted between the plate and the fluid, which keeps the

latter in a state of rapid vibration. At a white heat, this repulsion acts with the

greatest energy, whilst at a brown-red heat it ceases and the ordinary process of eva-
poration takes place. The temperature of the water whilst in the spheroidal state is

found to be only 96°, and this temperature is maintained so long as the heat of the

plate is kept up. To bring the water to the boiling-point (212°), it is therefore ne-

cessary to cool the plate. These phffinomena are explained by M. Boutigny on the

supposition that the sphere of water has a perfect reflecting surface, and consequently

that the heat of the incandescent plate is reflected back upon it ; and some experi-

ments have been made, which show that this is the case, the plate becoming visibly

redder over tho.se parts on which the vibrating globule played. Several experiments

were made in proof of this necessary cooling to produce ebullition. The red-hot

plate, with its spheroidal drop, was removed from the spirit-lamp, and after a minute

or two the water began to boil, and was rapidly dissipated in steam. Ammonia and

aether were shown, although so exceedingly volatile, to act in the same manner ; the
aether, however, being decomposed whilst in the vibratory condition, in the same man-

ner as it is by the action of platina wire, forming a peculiar acid. Iodine put upon the

heated plate became fluid, and revolved in the same manner as other fluids, no vapours

escaping whilst the high temperature of the metal was maintained                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           but when allowed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

to cool to the point of dull redness, it was immediately dissipated in violet vapours.
The nitrate of ammonia, when fused on the glowing hot plate, vibrated with great energy

but on cooling the capsule, the salt entered into vivid combustion. The repulsive

action was shown by plunging a lump of silver at a glowing red heat into a glass of

water.  As long as its bright redness was maintained, there was no ebullition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but as.

water appeared like a silver plate. The application of the principles involved in these

phsenomena to the tempering of metals was then explained. If a metal to be tem-

pered is in a highly incandescent state, the necessary hardening will not take place on

plunging it into water. It is therefore necessary that a certain temperature should

be observed. Experiments were made to show that the repulsive power of the sphe-

roidal fluid existed, not merely between it and the hot plate, but between it and other

fluids. iEther and water thus repelled each other, and water rested on and rolled

over turpentine.  The bursting of steam-boilers came next under consideration and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

it was shown that many serious explosions may be referred to the plujenomena under

consideration. In a great many cases, the explosions have occurred during the cool-

ing of the boilers after the withdrawal of the fire. An experiment was shown in proof

Aof the view entertained by M. Boutigny.  sphere of copper, fitted with a safety-

valve, was heated, and a little water being put into it, it was securely corked up, and

withdrawn from the lamp. As long as the metal remained red, everything was quiet;

--but upon cooling, the cork was blown out with explosive violence. The concluding

experiment excited great interest the production of ice in a vessel at a glowing red

heat. It was successfully performed by M. Boutign)', in the following manner:

A deep platina capsule was brought to a glowing red heat, and at the same moment

water and liquid sulphureous acid, which had been preserved in the liquid state by

a freezing mixture, were poured into the vessel. The rapid evaporation of the vola-

tile sulphureous acid, which enters into ebullition at the freezing-point, produced such

an intense degree of cold, that a large lump of ice was immediately formed, and being

thrown out of the red-hot vessel, handed round for examination.

On a New Property of Gases.  By  Professor  Graham,  M.A.                        F.R.S.  L.Sf  E.
                                                                              ,

   After explaining the law which regulated the diffusion of gases, and stating the
fact, that the lighter gases diffused themselves much more speedily than the more

--dense ones, the velocity of their diffusion being equal to the square root of their
--densities, he proceeded to relate his experiments on the passage of gases into a

viicuum. To this passage the term Effusion has been applied. The velocity of air

being 1', the velocity of oxygen was found to be 0'9J00 by experiment, and by calcu-
lation 0'9487. Carbonic acid being much heavier than air, gave the number 0-821,
the theoretical number being 0'812. Carburetted hydrogen gave 0'1322 as the velo-
city of its effusion, the theoretical number being r341. Hydrogen gave as the velo-
citv of effusion 3-Gl.'3 by experiment, which was nearly the amount given by theory

(o'379). The interference of friction, even of minute orifices, was then described,
and shown to admit of easy correction. Some useful applications were mentioned
as in the manufacture of coal-gas, where it is desirable to ascertain the quality, as well
as the quantity of gas manufactured. As the gas will pass the orifice on its way to
a vacuum the quicker the lighter it is, and the more slowly as it increases in density,
and as the superior carburetted hydrogen is heaviest, it would be easy to construct an
instrument to register this velocity, and thus mark at once the required quality and
quantity of gas. It was also proposed that an instrument might be used in mines to
detect the presence of light carburetted hydrogen (fire-damp). The passage of gases
under pressure through porous bodies was termed by Prof. Graham, Transpiration.
The mode adopted in experiment was, to take a glass receiver, open at the top, which
was closed with a plate of stucco. This was placed on an air-pump, and the air ex-
hausted by the pump, the velocity with which the air passed through the stucco being
marked by the mercurial gauge of the pump. The transpiration of atmospheric air
was found to be more rapid than that of oxygen. Carbonic acid is found to be more
transpirable than oxygen, or even, under low pressure, than atmospheric air. The
transpiration of hydrogen is one-third more rapid than that of oxygen. The appli-
cability of this process of experimenting to the explanation of exosmose and endosmose
action in the passage of fluids through porous bodies was pointed out.

media, Dr. Miller proceeded to explain his method of examining the subject. The

light, being admitted by a longitudinal slit in a plate of metal, one half of this slit
was covered with a vessel containing the gaseous medium, the other half transmitted
ordinary light ; the image of the slit, after falling on a prism of Munich glass, was
observed by a telescope. It was found that the dark lines of the spectrum materially
changed their positions as different coloured gases were used ; and that, by subjecting
the spectrum to the absorptive influences of chlorine, nitrous acid vapour, the vapours
of iodine, bromine, perchloride, manganese, &c., numerous dark bands, not previously
observed, were brought into view. Sevei-al of the oxides of chlorine were examined,
and it was found that the chlorous acid, peroxide of oxide of chlorine and euchlorine
all gave the same series of lines. The spectra produced by coloured flames were also

examined, and many curious conditions observed. Dr. Miller had sought to ascertain
if any relation could be found between the chemical characters of the bodies under
examination and their properties of exhibiting Fraunhofer's lines ; but as yet no such

relation could be detected.

--Contributions to Retina- Chemistry. On the Chemical Changes produced by

   the Solar Rays, and the Influence of Actinism in disturhing Electrical Forces.

   By Robert Hunt.

   He detailed a great number of experiments which supported his views, that a cer-

tain class of chemical compounds possessed the property of fixing the chemical prin-
ciple of light. The result of the researches of the author, since the York meeting,
was that in all cases chemical action was either accelerated or retarded by the influ-
enc3 of the actinic force, whatever it may be. It was evident that the peculiar elec-
trical condition of the compound regulated the disposing power of the actinic rays
but it was not yet determined if any constant relation was maintained between the
electrical state and the action of this chemical power. The author found in all cases,
that weak electrical currents which were sufficient to precipitate the metals from so-
lutions in the dark, were not capable of doing so when they were exposed to sunshine,
or even diffused daylight. The power of this principle in producing molecular dis-
turbance was also mentioned, and many additional experiments were described.

      On the Manufacture of a Coloured Glass. By M. Splittgerber.

   I have the honour to present herewith small pieces of white glass, which are quite
transparent, but contain however a portion of gold, which was added to the grit as
chlorate of gold *, and which gives to this glass the curious quality to become red by
slightly re-heating it over the alcohol lamp; a greater heat changes the colour,
and the gold is restored to its characteristic tint, which quality has been long known,
and employed by the crystal glass manufacturer. It is now the question, in what
state the gold is contained in the glass, when not at all coloured, and when coloured.

In my opinion, the gold is in the white glass in the most oxidated state, analogous

to the state of the lead in the white crystal glass, but, by re-heating, it loses a part
of the oxygen, and becomes more and more reduced.

   According to the opinion of other German philosophers, the gold is contained even

in the white glass in the metallic state, but in a state of the greatest difiusion ; and in

the coloured condition in a state of less and less diffusion. I am not of this opinion,

because I have, by melting the red glass with a blowpipe supplied with oxygen gas,
made it again colourless, but only to a very small extent ; and it is not very clear, I
think, that the change of colour of this glass is the result of different states of deoxida-
tion of the gold in it. But it is very curious that the glass does not become red by
its first melting, and I can give no reason for this phsenomenon. In the Annals of
M. Poggendorff I have noticed it last year ; but I think that this phzenomenon would
be also interesting for a further optical investigation.

--30 REPORT 1845.

On Recent Experiments on the Gas Voltaic Battery. By Professor Grove.

   No previous description of the gas battery having been communicated to the Asso-

ciation, Prof. Grove entered into an explanation of the action of hydrogen gas upon

--spongy platina, and gave a description of the first gas battery constructed with pla-

tina wire sealed into glass tubes in pairs, hydrogen being put into one tube, and

oxygen into the other. An arrangement of this kind being connected with a volta-

meter, it was found that exactly the same quantity of gases was eliminated in the
tubes of that instrument as combined in the tubes of the battery. Experiments have

been made by Prof. Grove with a view of ascertaining if other gases might be used

in the battery, and it was discovered that a great variety of gases might be so used

and he then pointed out how perfectly any eudiometric analyses might be carried on

Awith the gas battery, provided some attention was paid to a few sources of error.

form of the instrument as hitherto constructed by Prof. Grove was described, for

the purpose of avoiding the absorption of atmospheric air by the fluid in the cells of

Athe battery.  more recent construction of the battery was next described, in which

many other applications of the voltaic battery are attained, being a combination in
which several pairs of gas tubes are connected in one compact body. A main ad-

vantage arising from this battery is the really constant condition of it ; once charged,
it appears that the action will go on for years, requiring nothing more than occasion-

ally, at long intervals, adding a little zinc to the acidulated solution in one cell, for
the purpose of supplying the loss of hydrogen in the tubes. The results of experi-

ment have shown, that the most invariable action may be calculated on for years

and that, by this instrument, researches requiring for a long period the constant flow
of a galvanic current m?.y be most effectually carried out. Some experiments on the
combination of phosphorus and sulphur with oxygen in the battery were then de-
tailed ; by which it was found that any inflammable body capable of volatilization
gave a galvanic action with oxygen in the other tube. Camphor, alcohol, ;ether,
and other bodies proved the generality of this effect. It was then stated, that
throughout these researches it had been found that chemical action and voltaic action

were convertible into each other.

On the Voltaic Reduction of Alloys. By C. V. Walker.

This communication was intended to explain the methods by which the author has

succeeded in throwing down metallic alloys from compound solutions by the action of

galvanic electricity. The process adopted is to prepare a strong solution of cyanide

of potassium, and commence electrolyzing it by means of a copper anode ; as soon as

copper begins to be dissolved, the copper anode is removed, and its place supplied with

one of zinc ; after the action has continued for some little time, brass will be liberated

on the cathode. The solution is now ready for use, and is operated upon by two or
three Daniell's cells, and with a brass anode. By similar means alloys of gold and

copper, or gold and silver, may be deposited. The author reasons, that true brass is

a definite chemical compound; and states, it appears possible that the anode, which

is a brass of commerce, is a true alloy, plus an excess of zinc ; that the solution it pro-

duces is a mixed solution, which consists of the potassio-cyanide of brass and the po-

tassio-cyanide of zinc.  This solution  is  very  readily  decomposable                                                                               it  is  therefore
                                                                                                                                                   ;

necessary to prepare it a short time previously to its use. Many specimens were exhi-

bited of copper and other metals coated with brass. The author makes some remarks

on the theory of the action ; and concjudes by stating that it will bo quite possible to

determine, within certain limits, the character of the alloy that shall present itself,

and that we may be enabled to throw down gold and silver according to standard.

Description of a Colossal Hydro- Electric Machine, with a Notice of some

   Phcenomena attending the production of Electricity by Steam. By W. G.

   Armstrong.

   The machine described by the author, and which has recently been sent out to the
United States of America, resembles the machine at the Polytechnic Institution in
external dimensions, but is more powerful.

   As an illustration of the power of this machine, Mr. Armstrong stated that it bad

fully charged a battery containing thirty-three square feet of coated surface upwards

of sixty times in a minute. He also mentioned tliat by interrupting the electric cur-

rent and causing it to pass through the thin wire coil of Colladon's apparatus for induc-
tive effects, he had obtained a secondary current in the thick wire coil, answering in all
respects to an alternating voltaic current, and sufficient to occasion a permanent though
slight scintillation of two pieces of steel attached to opposite ends of the wire, and

rubbed against each other.
    Mr. Armstrong reiterated his conviction that the excitation of electricity in the

hydro-electric machine was due to the friction sustained by particles of water in pass-
ing through tlie escape aperture, for by no other explanation was it possible to account

--for the prodigious influence which is exercised by the form of the escape orifice, by
--the material against which the current is rubbed, by the presence of w ater in the
--issuing steam, and by the condition of such water with respect to extraneous sub-

stances contained in it.

   He adverted to Professor P'araday's experiment of reversing the electricity of the

boiler and steam-cloud by introducing oil of turpentine into the steam passages, which
effect had been attributed by Faraday to the particles of water becoming invested with
a film of turpentine ; but Mr. Armstrong stated that there were many soluble sub-
stances which were equally effective in reversing the electricity, and so sensitive were
the electric properties of the water to the influence of foreign substances, that even
the inappreciable quantity of extraneous matter which the water appeared to acquire
by contact with condensing pipes of different materials was sufiicient to affect the
 excitation of the electricity.

On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat. By James P. Joule.

The author gave the results of some new experiments, in order to confirm the

views he had already derived from experiments on the heat evolved by magneto-

electricity, and from experiments on the changes of temperature produced by the

condensation and rarefaction of elastic fluids. He exhibited to the Section an ap-

Aparatus consisting of a can of peculiar construction filled with water.  sort of paddle-

wheel was placed in the can, to which motion could be communicated by means of

weights thrown over two pulleys working in contrary directions. He stated, that the

force spent in revolving the paddle-wheel produced a certain increment in the tem-

perature of the water, and hence he drew the conclusion, that when the temperature

of a lb. of water is increased by one degree of Fahrenheit's scale, an amount of vis

viva is communicated to it equal to that acquired by a weight of 890 lbs. after falling

from an altitude of one foot.

                         By George Kemp, M.D.,F.C.P.S.

   The object of the following paper is to furnish what has hitherto been a desidera-

--tum, an arrangement of organic bodies with reference to their natural affinities, and

which, being based on the operations wliich are observable in living organized bodies,
will, it is hoped, furnish the student with a means of grouping the results of his la-
bours, and the philosopher with safe materials for developing those general laws, to
which every organized being owes its capability of replacing its own ever-wasting
structure, and reproducing a form analogous to itself.

    Assuming, then, that all organic bodies of which nitrogen forms no part have been
originally derived from starch, and that those, on the other hand, in which nitrogen
is an essential element proceed from proteine, we have at once two general classes,

which we may denominate amylogenic and proteunogenic.

                                        Class I. Amylogenic Bodies.

Order 1. Products which result from the direct operation of natural causes.

    and nitrogen remaining constant; as the middle coat of arteries and mucus.
Order 1. Genus 3. Bodies in which all the organic elements assume a new proportion

    to each other, but which may be considered as compounds of proteine and a non-

    nitrogenized body included in Class 1. Order 1.
Order 2. Genus 1. Products resulting from the disturbance of the molecular equili-

   brium of proteine compounds when deprived of vitality, the action being much
    promoted by moderate increase of temperature and moisture. (Eremacasis of

Order 2. Genus 2. Products effected by a high temperature. (Pyrogenic bodies.)
Order 2. Genus 3. Results of the action of oxidizing agents; these are very nume-

    rous.

   The author believes that no difficulty will occur in referring any organic body to
one or other of the above divisions, and proceeds to give, as an instance of the appli-

cation of the system, the interpretation of the analysis of the food of the milch cow.

0?i Gutta Percha, a new variety of Caoutchouc. By Edward Solly, F.R.S.

    Within the last two or three years, a very remarkable substance has been trans-
mitted to this country from Sincapore imder the name of Gutta Percha; it was first
sent over by Dr. Montgomerie, who received the gold medal of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, &c., for its introduction into this country as a new and hitherto

unknown substance likely to be useful for several purposes in the arts. He was how-

ever unable to ascertain the tree from which it is procured, or indeed any more of its
history than that it is obtained in large quantities by cutting down the trees which
yield it, and that it is employed by the natives to make the handles of knives and
other tools, being preferred by them for this purpose even to buffalo's horn. Mr.
Solly described Gutta Percha as being a white or dirty pinkish-coloured solid, having
little or no smell, insoluble in water and consequently tasteless, having a silky fibrous
textui'e, and feeling smooth and almost greasy to the fingers ; at the same time that
it presents considerable resistance to any substance which is rubbed or drawn across
it, thus enabling it to be grasped or held with great firmness in the hand.

   At temperatures below 50° it is hard, tough, and in thin pieces flexible, a good deal
resembling horn in its physical characters. From 50° to 70° it becomes more flexible
and slightly elastic, still however retaining its remarkable stiffness and toughness.

When forcibly extended it shows very little power of contraction, requiring consider-

able force to extend it, and retaining the form which has been given to it after the
force which was applied is discontinued. At a temperature between 140° and 160° it
becomes soft and remarkably plastic, its tenacity being at the same time greatly
diminished. In this state two or more pieces may be joined together with the greatest
facility (far greater than is the case with caoutchouc), and in a manner which may
almost be compared to bees'-wax, inasmuch as whether the pieces are clean or dirty
thej' unite on the slightest pressure and form a perfect joint.

   When in the soft and plastic state, Gutta Percha may be pressed or moulded into

any required shape; as it cools it gradually re-acquires its former tough and rigid
nature. The casts which are obtained in this manner from coins, medals, &c., are
remarkably sharp and perfect. Gutta Percha at ordinary temperature is divided by

a knife with great difficulty, behaving like cold hard caoutchouc ; its division is much fa-
cilitated by the useof a wet knife. Its specific gravity is greater than that of caoutchouc,
being 0"9791, whilst the latter is about 0-9355. Kept for some time at a temperature
of near 200° it gradually parts with a small quantity of moisture, and becomes dark-
coloured and translucent : it however assumes its original appearance again if steeped
for some time in water. Exposed to a liigher temperature, it melts, is decomposed,
and finally burns with a very smoky flame like caoutchouc. Analysis shows it to be
a hydrocarbon, identical in composition with ordinary caoutchouc. Ordinary solvents
exert little or no action on Gutta Percha; water, alcohol, oils, alkaline solutions, mu-
riatic and acetic acids produce nb effect whatever. Strong sulphuric acid slowly chars
it, concentrated nitric acid gradually oxidizes it, and gether, essential oils and coal-tar
naphtha in time soften and partially dissolve it. The most perfect solvent appeared to

be oil of turpentine, which formed a clear transparent solution, from which the pure
Gutta Percha was readily obtained on evaporating the oil of turpentine.

   The physical properties of this substance are such as to place it amongst the sub-

stitutes for leather, and will probably render it a valuable article of import. Its
chemical properties show it to be a variety of caoutchouc.

Notice of the Oil of Assafoetida. ^z/ Thomas Tilley, Professor of Chemistry in
 the Queen's College, Birmingham, and Douglas Maclagan, M,D,,F.R.S.E.

   The authors describe the analytical processes which they followed, and state the
numerical results. They prove that the oil of assafoetida contains, and is chiefly com-
posed of, the sulphuret of allyl and an oil heavier than water, also containing sul-
phur. They conclude by the following summary :

    It has been shown by the investigations of other chemists and ourselves, that the
class of substances used as condiments of the onion order of flavour, though produced
in difierent zones and by diiferent natural orders, contains the same organic radical
united to sulphur of plants or sulpho-cyanogen.

   The oil of garlic, from a liliaceous plant ; the oil of mustard, a compound of allyl
with sulpho-cyanogen from the Cruciferge ; the oil of assafoetida, so much used in
India for a condiment, from the Umbelliferas, all contain the same organic radical,
and form a parallel case to the tea, the coffee, and the Paraguay tea-plants, which also
contain the same substance, theine, and which are used for similar purposes. The

authors are still continuing this investigation.

On the Chemical Principles involved in the Rotation of Crops.
                  By Professor Daubeny, F.R.S.

Professor Daubeny made some remarks on the chemical principles involved in the

rotation of crops, stating the conclusions which he had deduced from a series of ex-

periments carried on within the Botanic Garden at Oxford, and intended to ascertain

the rate of diminution in the produce of several plots of ground that had been sown

for ten years, either continuously with the same, or successively with different crops,

Hein either case without the addition of manure throughout the course of the trials.

stated, that although, as might have been anticipated, a diminution in the latter years'

produce took place both in the permanent and in the shifting crops, and although a
smaller average amount was obtained in the former than in the latter, yet that after the

expiration of the whole period the ground still continued unexhausted ; and that an

analysis of it showed it still to contain sufficient of the phosphates to supply materials

for nineteen crops of barley, suificient of potass for fifteen, and sufficient of soda for

forty-five. The actual diminution of produce during the latter years he therefore attri-

buted to the circumstance of these ingredients not being in a soluble cotidition, it

being found, that from the soil so long drawn upon, water impregnated with carbonic
acid took up much less of the above ingredients than it did from the same that had

Hot been so cropped and but recently manured. The greater diminution in the per-
manent than in the shifting crop he attributed to the circumstance of the latter being

supplied with a larger amount of organic matter, derived from the fallow crop inter-

calated, owing to which the plants would be more fully developed, through the influ-

ence of the carbonic acid and ammonia, which would be imparted to them durino- the

decomposition of tlie humus. He pointed out, liow the mere introduction of healthy

plants into a soil might aid in rendering the phosphates and alkaline salts, locked up

within the latter, more speedily soluble, and hence inferred that a larger amount of

these substances might be extracted where the plants were stimulated into activity by

the presence of decomposing organic matter. He also was led to inquire whether, in

the event of a scantier supply of one of the alkalies or of the earths than was common,

a plant would substitute ad libitum another which might be presented to it in greater
abundance. To determine this, he obtained from Mr. Way, late assistant to Professor

Graham, an analysis of three samples of six different kinds of crop, viz. potatoes,

barley, turnips, hemp, flax, and beans ; one sample being that cultivated for ten suc-

cessive years in the same ground without manure ; the second from a similar plot

which had grown different crops for the same period without manure ; the third from
a plot in a contiguous part of the garden which had been recently manured. From

the results obtained, it would appear that the aggregate amount of 6ases, in the three

samples, was about the same ; but the proportion of these bases one to the other varied

considerably, a circumstance at first sight appearing to confirm the theory of substi-

tution. The author, however, conceives, that this may be explained by supposing a

different degreeof developmentof the several parts orproximate principles in the respec-

tive samples, as he finds a great discrepancy in the amount of phosphoric acid present
in gluten and in starch, and thinks it probable that the same diversity may extend to

other of the principles contained in each plant. That potass is belter adapted for the

organization of a plant than soda, seems to follow from the circumstance, that whilst

the soil usually contained an excess of soda, the plant always was most rich in potass.

The authoi", therefore, in accordance with the views of Liebig, throws out as a con-
jecture, that the soda found in the ash may be that circulating through the vegetable

tissue, and contained in the sap, whilst the potass is actually assimilated, and consti-
tutes a part of the vegetable tissue. The former, as Liebig supposes, may be useful

in conveying carbonic acid to the plant, but cannot be substituted for potass, at least

without injury to its healthy condition. It appears also, from the analyses referred

to, that land-plants have not the power of decomposing common salt ; so that this

substance cannot, as has been supposed, be serviceable to vegetation by affording a

Wesupply of alkali.  may also infer, that it does not follow, because a soil is benefited

by manuring, that it is destitute of the ingredients which the manure supplies, since it

may happen that these ingredients are present in the soil in an insoluble, and there-
fore not in an available condition. Chemical and mechanical means may no doubt be

effectual in bringing into a soluble condition the phosphates and alkaline salts thus

locked up within the soil, but as this is brought about by Nature herself, we might

often spare ourselves the necessity of resorting to such means, if we would only re-

solve not to counteract her beneficial agency, by suffering to run to waste the various
excrementitious matters which she has placed at our disposal. The analyses given,
from their great discrepancy with those of Sprengel, may also show the importance of
that investigation of the constituents of the ashes of plants, which is now about to be
undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Agricultural Society. The author also

conceived that the line of research which he had pursued might be useful, in illus-

trating that system of scientific book-keeping which he had proposed at a former

meeting of the Association, at once as an useful exercise to the agricultural student,

and as a means of introducing greater precision into the conduct of our experiments

on such subjects.

                         On the Analysis of the Ashes of Plants.
 By J. Thomas Way, Professor of Chemistry, Royal Agricultural College.

   The method here described was that pursued by the author in the analyses which

are detailed in Dr. Daubeny's paper "On the Rotation of Crops," (see p. 33). It

is founded on that of Will and Fresenius (Chemical Memoirs, part ix.), but differs
in several essential particulars, more especially in the estimation of the phosphoric

acid.

   Two hundred grs. of the prepared ash are dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The so-
              --;

                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                           35

lution is evaporated to dryness to separate sand and charcoal and the silica of the ash.

The silica is dissolved out from the former impurities by dilute solution of caustic alkali,

and estimated in the usual manner. The sand and charcoal are also weighed. The

solution of the ash is now divided by measure into four equal portions. From one

portion peroxide of iron, lime and magnesia are obtained. In a second quantity the

phosphoric acid is estimated. In a third the alkalies, potash and soda are found, and

the fourth is reserved.

 --Estimation of Peroxide of Iron, Lime and Magnesia. The determination of the

oxide of iron is indirect; it is obtained by throwing it down in combination with the

phosphoric acid of the ash. To the acid solution (partly neutralized by ammonia)

acetate of ammonia is added in the cold, phosphate of iron precipitates, is collected

and weighed                                                            100 parts contain 56-08 parts of peroxide of iron.      The filtered liquid
                                                                    ;

affords lime by treatment with oxalate of ammonia (the acetic acid remaining in ex-

cess), and magnesia by the subsequent addition of phosphate of soda and ammonia.

 --Second portion. Estimation of Phosphoric Acid. The estimation of the phosphoric

Aacid is also indirect.                                                portion of clean iron wire is weighed out and dissolved in

nitric acid. The solution is added to that of the ash, and the whole is partially neu-

tralized by ammonia. Acetate of ammonia is added, and the liquid is brought to the

Aboiling-point.                                                        precipitate of phosphate and peroxide of iron (which is of a buiF-

brown colour, provided the iron is in proper excess) is obtained. This is collected,

burnt and weighed ; the phosphoric acid is calculated by subtracting the weight of

peroxide of iron originally present in the ash, and that to which the metallic iron added

is equivalent ; it sometimes happens that a little iron remains in the liquid ; this must

be thrown down by ammonia, collected separately on a small filter, and its weight

added to that of the former precipitate previous to the calculation.

The alkalies are obtained (from the third portion of liquid) precisely as recom-

mended by Will and Fresenius. P'or the estimation of the chlorine and sulphuric

acid, a separate portion of ash is dissolved in nitric acid, and precipitated successively

by nitrate of barytes and nitrate of silver.

In the statement of the analyses, the chlorine is always apportioned to the sodium

of the soda found, or in default of this to its equivalent quantity of potassium. (See

Dr. Daubeny's paper.) From the constant use of this process during a period of six

months spent in the analysis of the ashes of plants, the author recommends it as by

far the most easy of execution and satisfactory in its results of any at present em-

ployed.                                                                ^__^_

         Observations on the Ashes of Plants. By Professor Johnston.

On the Ashes of Oats. By J. P. Norton {Connecticut, United States).

The following are the results of numerous analyses made during the past year by

the author :

 --1. The quantity of ash varies in different parts of the same plant. I have divided

the plant into seven portions, the grain, the husk, the straw at three different heights,

the leaf, and the chaff. I give the extremes of my trials with numerous samples. In

the grain the per-centage                                              ranges from  1"81  to  2-32                    in  the  husk from 5-27 to 7"1I
                                                                                                                   ;

in the top straw from 4-95 to 9'22 ; in the middle straw from 4-23 to 7'89 ; in the

bottom straw from 5'18 to 9-76 ; in the leaf from 7-19 to 14-59; in the chaff from

6-71 to 18-59. I do not give these as the true extremes, but merely as the extremes

myof trials. I have not found that regular gradation from top to bottom which has

been observed in wheat and rye ; there seems to be no general rule. These ashes

are of course all calculated dry, and no per-centage ever considered to be ascertained

until three or four trials agreed.

2. The quality of the ash varies in the several parts of the same plant. This is

shown by instances from a table of the composition of one of the samples which I have

analysed. The ash from the grain contains 49'24 per cent, of phosphoric acid, 31-15

of potash and soda, 13-93 salts of lime and magnesia, 0-80 of soluble silica, 0*93 of

Equally striking differences are observed in the other parts. In the top straw were

38'56 per cent, of salts soluble in water ; in the middle straw 53*56 ; in the bottom
straw 77*46. As the soluble salts increase from the top downwards, so the silica in-
creases from the bottom upwards. The per-centage of soluble and insoluble silica in

the bottom straw is   17*28                                   in  the middle 40*48 ;   in the top 48*44.                                        The leaf is in its

composition not very unlike the top straw. In the chaft", phosphoric acid again ap-

pears in the watery solution, seldom present in that solution from the ash of the straw

or leaf, and the per-centage of soluble silica is very great.

3. The quality of ash varies in the same parts in different samples. This even-

extends to tlie same variety of oats. I compare two samples of Hopeton oats, one

grown in Northumberland and the other in Fife. There are differences in every part,

mybut I will illustrate                                       point by the straw.      In the top, middle and bottom straw,

respectively, of the Northumberland sample, tlie proportions of salts soluble in water

are  41-96,  53*22,  77*46                                    while  in  the  same divisions of that                                      from  Fife  they are  71*70,

84*03, 90"26. There is a corresponding difference in the silica, increasing upwards

as before. The same excess of soluble salts prevails through the whole of this

sample.

   These examples illustrate the proposed points, and show the necessity of further

myinvestigation. This is all that I proposed to do in the present incomplete state of

researches.

            On the Ashes of Narcotic Plants. By F. C. Wrightson.

   The great problem of chemistry of the present day in its application to agriculture

--is, to determine the conditions necessary for a soil to produce the largest amount of

any given crop of animal food of food for man or beast. The solution to this ques-
tion will in some measure be found when we have ascertained the proportions of
mineral constituents required by plants of culture for attaining full perfection. The
analysis of these plants alone, however, is not sufficient ; we must have analyses of
the weeds growing upon soils, of plants unfit for the sustenance of animals ; for it is
shown that they rob the farmer, not only of a large amount of mineral manure, but
also of considerable quantities of that valuable ingredient, ammonia ; and we shall
not have obtained the data necessary for an improved and rational system of culture
until we include in our ash-analyses a considerable number of weeds and useless
plants, especially those of the most destructive kind. Some of them are well known

to the farmer to be of serious injury to his crops mechanically ; with respect to their
abstracting important constituents of the soil, their injurious effects cannot be ques-
tioned. These plants contain more than 8 per cent, chlorine, and from 30 to 50 per
cent, alkalies in their ashes. The dried leaves contained between 6 and 8 per cent,

of nitrogen.

             On the Ashes of Wheat. By William Sharp, F.R.S.

Mr. Sharp noticed that the amount of the ashes of wheat was given by Professor

Johnston from Sprengel as 1*177 per cent., whereas Sprengel himself (p. 446. vol. ii.

of his ' Chemie fiir  Landwirthe ') states it                                      to  be 1*777                                           Dr. Daubeny, on  the  other

hand, gives Sprengel's analysis as 2-137, both of which alterations are made on the

supposition of a misprint in Sprengel's book. This led Mr. Sharp to undertake some

experiments in order to ascertain the truth ; and about a hundred experiments were
performed, with great care, on varieties of red and white wheat, grown on different

soils and climates in England, Germany, Sweden, Poland, Holland and Saxony. The

--results gave answers to the following questions : 1st. What is the average amount

of inorganic matter in the grain of wheat? This varies within the limits of 1*5 and

1*75 per cent. 2nd. Does the quantity of inorganic matter bear any relative propor-

tion to the specific gravity of the grain, that is, to its weight per bushel ? The ex-

periments show that a steady inverse ratio is maintained between the proportionate

\Veight per bushel and the amount of ashes. Wheat weighing 64 lbs. per bushel yields

1'5 percent.; and this amount gradually increases till wheat weighing 58 Ihs. per

bushel gives 1-75 percent, of incombustible matter. 3rd. How much inorganic matter

is removed from the soil of an acre of land by the grain of a crop of wheat ? The

answer to tiiis practical question is one pound per bushel. From these experiments the

farmer may learn with certainty, that if his fields produce five quarters of wheat per

acre, that grain carries along with it to the mairket forty poitnds weight of the earthy

material of each acre of ground. It must be obvious tliat if this be not restored in

quantity and quality, in the shape of manure, his fields must be correspondingly

impoverished.

Several substances, particularly nitric acid, were tried in order to ascertain if any

chemical preparation could be added to the specimens experimented upon, before or

during the  combustion,  which  would facilitate  the  otherwise  tedious  process                                    but  they
                                                                                                                   ;

all failed to give satisfactory results. The per-centage left by nitric acid was always

less, but not uniformly less than it ought to have been.

Analysis of three species of Fucus. By E. G. Schweitzer.

The author described his method of analysis, and remarks, if we refer to the table

of analyses there will be perceived a marked difference in the proportions of the va-

rious ingredients, particularly between those of the Laminaria and those of the two

Weother Fuci, which difference may offer no small advantage to agriculture.                                           have in

the Laminaria saccharina the alkaline carbonates predominating, whereas in the two

other Fuci, the sulphates. The preponderating quantity of potassa over that of soda

in the Laminaria is remarkable ; it contains 22*4 per cent, of potassa to 188 per cent, of

soda, whilst Fucus vesiculosushas 17'4 per cent, of potassa to 27-4 per cent, of soda, and

Fucus serratus 15 per cent, of potassa to 25 per cent, of soda. But sea-water contains only

in 1000 parts 0-76 chloride of potassium to 27*05 of chloride of sodium ; it is there-
fore obvious that by the influence of vitality the potassa must have been powerfully

attracted and assimilated ; a similar fact is more particularly evinced in the quantity of

iodine, of which the Laminaria contains 3'6 per cent., and the sea-water scarcely one-

millionth part of its own weight. However, all the ingredients contained in sea-plants

must have been derived from the sea-water, and though phosphoric acid is not dis-

cernible in the residue from the evaporation of the quantity of water usually employed

in quantitative analysis, nevertheless there can be no doubt that it exists in it, and

would be found if larger quantities of water were subjected to analysis.

  An experiment was performed to ascertain if iodine is exhaled from the Laminaria

saccharina when exposed to the rays of the sun. Several pounds of this sea-weed

were introduced into a large glass vessel, closed by a cork, from which was suspended

a small vessel containing a weak solution of nitrate of silver and a slip of paper with

amylum paste. This apparatus was for six weeks subjected to the direct influence of

a summer's sun (but so that the rays did not fall upon the tests), yet no turbidity in

the silver solution, nor any reaction upon the amylum paste was visible. But I have

to notice the fact that the plant began slightly to ferment, and that the glass vessel was

filled with alcoholic vapours. It has been asserted that the saccharine matter in this

Fucus is only mannite, but we know that mannite does not undergo fermentation, it

must therefore contain another substance, from which the vinous fermentation pro-

ceeds. This will form a subject for future inquiry. The slimy fluid of the Laminaria

in its fresh state is perfectly neutral, but when exposed to the air it soon indicates an

acid reaction. Eight ounces of this Fucus were mixed with pure water and distilled,

but neither in the distilled fluid was iodine indicated, nor was a slip of paper with

amylum paste, kept during distillation before the tube that conducted the vapours,

acted upon. The distilled fluid contained no essential oil, but was strongh' impreg-

nated with the peculiar odour belonging to sea-plants, which odour seems therefore

not to be derived from the presence of iodine, or if so, the olfactory nerves must be a

superior test to those employed. I have omitted to state that the above Fuci indi-

cated but faint traces of bromine in 50 grs. of ashes.

37-82; No. 7, 72-05.

I would now direct attention to some characteristics of the soils derived from the

decomposition of these slates. Directing our attention to carbonate of lime, that which

is immediately available, we see a range from 12-50 to 083 per cent: then to car-

bonate of magnesia, there is in one 3-06, and another 0-35. So as to iron and alu-

mina; in one there is 19-5, in another 4-82. These, with from 1 to S percent, of
alkaline matter, constitute the soluble portion from which the plant is directly to de-

rive its support.

   In No. 1, then, we have a soil rich in carbonate of lime, with a proper portion of mag-
nesia and alkalies, its only defect being the large quantity of iron. No. 3 has nearly the
same characteristics, though the lime is much smaller in quantity. In No. 7 there

is but 0-34 of carbonate of lime, 0-35 of carbonate of magnesia; while in No. 6 there is
3-33 carbonate of lime, 3-09 carbonate of magnesia, and 12-13 of iron and alumina.
This soil would obviously in its natural state be very unproductive. That quantity
of magnesia might be injurious without lime, and much of the iron was protoxide.

There is little to hope from the decomposition of the insoluble portion either, for it
has only 0-17 of carbonate of lime; while there is 3-06 carbonate of magnesia, and

39-40 of iron and alumina. This is the worst example, though Nos. 5 and 2 are not

many degrees better.

These seven slates, then, all picked up within a small extent of country, afford

seven different soils, varying from very good to very bad.
   The physical state of this section of Wigtonshire is to a great extent unimproved,

the land being excessively cold and wet ; leaving this out of view, however, or rather

supposing drainage complete the excess of iron, we may see in the variation of the
per-centage of lime an explanation of many conflicting opinions that prevail respect-

ing its use as a manure.

AOn Mineral Manure. By Professor Liebig.                                      verbal communication by

               Eknest Dieffenbach, M.D. (of Berlin.)

After alluding to the varying conditions of soils under the circumstances of geolo-

gical and geographical position, Dr. Dieffenbach proceeded to point out the advantages

of using such a compound that it should meet these circumstances ; for instance, that
for a moist climate it would be necessary so to prepare the saline manure that, al-

though slowly decomposing to meet the requirements of vegetation, it should not be

so soluble as to be washed out of the soil by the rains. This is proposed to be effected

by Prof. Liebig ; and having ascertained the mineral constituents removed from the

soil, it will be the object of the manufacturer to supply their place in the mineral

manure. It was then pointed out that the manures required for wheat, oats, legumi-

nous plants and the potatoe must necessarily be different; and the object in view in

the manufacture of this sahne manure is to prepare it with the essential constituents

for particular crops.

vian, and curiously enough to consist almost entirely of the legs and other indigestible
parts of beetles.

   The salt was transparent and colourless, very soluble in water, and contained phos-

carbonaceous at a high temperature. The salt therefore appears to be a microcosmic
salt, phosphate of soda, ammonia, and water of crystallization.

spiirs of lower chalk have, by faults and denudations, been cut off from the general

mass and thus form a series of obscure outliers, the exact limits of which it is ex-

tremely difficult to define, in consequence of the featureless nature of the country

and the great beds of drifted clay and gravel which cover many parts of the more

regular formations. A small patch of chalk near Castle hill, and the chalk quarries

near Madingley, worked under a thick covering of drifted brown clay, are given as

examples. To the west of this irregular escarpment or boundary of the chalk, the

--following formations break out in a regular descending order : 1 . Upper green-

sand; 2. Gait; 3. Lower greensand ; 4. Kimmeridge clay; 5. Coral rag; 6. Ox-

--ford clay, which forms the subsoil of the great Bedford Level.
    1. Upper Greensand. This appears, as far as regards its thickness, in a very de-

generate form. The portion to which the term greensand is strictly applicable is

only a few inches thick, and above it there is sometimes an ambiguous deposit of a

few feet which forms a passage into the lower chalk. It is not true, as has formerly

been stated, that the chalk marl forms a passage into the gait ; for the upper green-

sand, without a single exception, makes a natural break between them. As the

chalk formation is generally pervious to water and the gait always impervious, it

necessarily follows that copious springs are thrown out by the greensand bed. The

springs at Cherry Hinton, the Nine-springs at the foot of the Gogmagog hills, and

those of Coton and Madingley, are given as examples ; and if a curved line be drawn

through the principal springs of the neighbourhood, it will give a good approxima-

tion to the true line of outcrop of the lower greensand. Thus it appears, by reference

to the map, that Cambridge is situate on the gait in a bay formed by two irregular

spurs of the lower chalk. Though the greensand is thus degenerate, its fossils are

numerous and extremely characteristic. Well known species of Exogyra and Tere-

bratula are in great abundance ; characteristic greensand Ammonites are not rare

Hippurites occur occasionally ; sharks' teeth and fish palates of several families are

abundant. Many fragments of the head-bones of several species of Chimxra occur

here and there, and paddle-bones and teeth of a Plesiosaurus have been found abun-

dantly near Barnwell, though mutilated and ill-preserved. But the most abundant

fossils are the well-known black nodules which resemble coprolites, but have none

of the structure of those bodies, being generally almost amorphous. They contain

however a large per-centage of phosphate of lime. The author does not consider

that their origin is yet well made out. The greensand, though partly incoherent and of

such inconsiderable thickness, yet appears to have protected the upper surface of the

gait from denudation ; for it spreads out over a considerable area to the west of the

chalk, forming the upper surface of the gait where that formation rises into the dry

--lands that skirt the neighbouring marshes.
   2. Gait. This formation, as has been proved by repeated borings for Artesian

wells, is more than 150 feet thick. None of the borings, though apparently com-

mencing at the top of the formation, reach 200 feet. As this formation occupies

a country almost at a dead level, and partially covered by marsh lands and gravel,

its superficial extent cannot be accurately represented. Its western Umits are how-

ever, here and there, well-defined by the outcrop of the lower greensand. The fos-

sils from this formation are derived from the upper part of it, as seen in the brick-

pits near Cambridge, and they agree very closely, so far as the}' go, with the fossils

of the Folkstone clay. Hamites, Crioceratites, and shells of the genus Inoceramus,

A&c. abound.  few shells of the genus Plicatula appear to be of the same species

--with those found in the lower beds of the neighbouring chalk marl.
   3. Lower Greensand and Sandstone. This formation is well seen at Denny Abbey,

on the road to Ely. To the east of that place it is, for many miles, concealed under

the marshes and makes no escarpment ; but it is probably continuous, as it breaks

out in greater force, forming an under terrace to the chalk escarpment of Norfolk,

and, as is well known, may be traced to the sea at Hunstanton Clilf. It is seen

near Cottenham, Rampton and Willingham (as represented on a map). It then

crosses the Huntingdon road about the seventh milestone, buried however under a
great thickness of the brown clay ( Till). Again, it breaks out at Els worth, and in a
denudation between Caxton and Bourne, and at Great Gransden. Beyond the last-

named place it increases in thickness and blends itself with the sand-hills of Bed-

fordshire. In the range above given it is perhaps, on the average, not more than
42 REPORT 1845.

twenty feet thick. It is composed of beds of sand and hard sandstone, sometimes

slightl)' calcareous, and is generally of a yellowish or rusty-brown colour, resembling

the upper beds of the formation seen on the south coast of England. Its fossils are

few in number and obscure, being composed of ferruginous mineralized fragments

of dicotyledonous wood, of fragments of shells, and bones of fishes. Good charac-

teristic fossil fishes have however been found in the formation near Lynn. As it is

pervious to water, is imbedded between two impervious strata of clay, and crops

out (on the confines of Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire) at a higher level than

the surface of the gait at Cambridge, it readily affords a supply of water to the

Artesian wells, as appears by the accompanying section*.

The most remarkable exhibition of the lower greensand is seen in an outlying

ridge (surrounded by low fen-lands and forming the true Isle of Ely) extending from

Ely to Kilrow, west of Haddenham. The ridge cannot be accounted for by the re-

gular rise of the strata towards the west, combined with a subsequent denudation ;
but has been produced by a fault elevating the ridge above the mean level of the

surrounding fens. This has been satisfactorily proved by the recent cuttings for the

railroad, which expose the chalk marl in situ at the base of the hill composed of Kim-

meridge clay and lower greensand. This chalk, to be on its true geological level,

ought to be about 150 feet above the top of the ridge. It is presumed, therefore,

that there is on the south-east side of the ridge a fault or upcast of about 150 feet,

as appears by the accompanying sections.

is full of characteristic fossils, such as Osfrea deltoidea, Gryphiea virgula, Ichthyodo-

rulites, reptiles' bones, &c. In other places, however (e. g. at Great Gransden and
Elsworth), the lower greensand appears to overlap the Kimmeridge clay and rests
immediately on a clay full of Oxford clay fossils, such as Gryphcea dilatata, &c.
In this respect the relations of the lower greensand to the inferior formations is only

--analogous to what is so often seen on the south coast of England.
   5. Coral Rag or Middle Oolite. It is well known that this formation, of a great
thickness on the south coast of England, gradually thins off in its range towards the
north, and comes to an edge in Buckinghamshire. In its further range towards the
north-east, for more than 100 miles, it almost entirely disappears, and the Oxford
clay and Kimmeridge clay are brought together without the intervention of any
stone bands to break the uniformity of the surface. The consequence is, that they
form a great plain occupying a part of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Lincolnshire.
To this remark there is one striking exception ; for at Upware, about eight miles be-
low Cambridge, a low ridge, extending about a mile in length and a few hundred
yards in breadth, rises out of the fen-lands. It is formed by a saddle of most cha-
racteristic coral rag, with many characteristic fossils. The author conjectures that
this elevation was effected by the same disturbing forces which produced the great

fault, above noticed, at Ely. This deposit is not exposed to its base, but cannot, it
is thought, be more than fifteen or twenty feet thick, and it is certain that it does
not form a continuous band concealed under the fens, as several wells have been sunk
(between Cambridge and Lynn) through the Kimmeridge clay into the Oxford clay
without passing through any beds which bore a resemblance to the coral rag.

   The accompanying section will explain the above short description.

But to the west of the Cam / (Kimmeridge clay) is worked in several pits ; and A

side no trace of the coral rag has been discovered.

  --6. Oxford Clay. This formation occupies by far the largest portion of the great

Bedford Level, and is of very great but unknown thickness. Its western boundary
is defined by the outcrop of the great oolite, and does not belong to the geology of
the neighbourhood of Cambridge. Its eastern boundary is very ill defined, often
passing under marsh lands where the subsoil is concealed from the view. At Great
Gransden and Elsworth, as stated above, it breaks out from beneath the lower green-
sand. All the low lands between Conington and St. Ives are composed of it. The
fen lands extending from Cottenham to Ely are on the Kimmeridge clay; and in
consequence of the upcast fault, which has produced the great outlier of Ely and
Haddenham, the Oxford clay is thrown more towards the north-west, so that its

upper beds crop out on the north-west side of the ridge, as appears in the preceding

section.

    Such are the principal facts connected with the stratification of the country near

Cambridge, and the localities where they are best exhibited may be examined a day's

excursion from Cambridge.

 but no proof has yet been given that it is of the same date or exactly of the same
 origin, and therefore the author gives it its local and provincial name. It is of con-
 siderable but very irregular thickness, of which 200 feet may be stated as about the
 maximum for the country near Cambridge. In general its thickness is much less.
 The higher table-lands on the confines of Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Hunt-
 ingdonshire, are almost entirely composed of it ; but it is found also at lower levels,
 and sometimes immediately under the marsh lands. It contains innumerable peb-
 bles and fragments of chalk, and multitudes of septaria and other stony concretions
 drifted out of the great fen-clay. Entangled in its mass are occasionally found blocks
 of greensantl, several tons in weight, and driven several miles from the parent rock.
 The author affirms his conviction that ninety-nine parts out of a hundred of the
 whole mass are derived from the country of the great fen-clay. Icebergs may, during
 the period, have transported boulders from a great distance, and dropped them among
 the superficial deposits of the country. But no conceivable action of icebergs could
 have scooped out the great hollow of the fens and spread the materials, far and Wide,
 over all the higher lands on the south-east side of the great level. The brown clay
 has been pushed bodily onward by the propelling force of water, the propelling force
 having been probably brought into action by some sudden elevation and change of
 level between land and water, of which the faults above noticed may give a partial

 evidence. In this neighbourhood there are no old local freshwater deposits above the
 brown clay like those which have been noticed on the coast of Norfolk.

  --2. Flint Gravel. This generally occupies the low country, and is too well-known

 to need description in this sketch. Its level is however by no means constant, and
 as it sometimes contains blocks of stone brought from a great distance, the author
refers it to the ill-defined period when the great erratic Mocks were transported over
 so many parts of England. That it was mainly produced by the action of the sea
 during changes of level, cannot admit of doubt ; but in a few places (e. g. near Barn-
well) its finer sandy beds contain many well-preserved specimens both of land and
freshwater shells, most of which are of existing species. It is conjectured that these
shells may have been chiefly derived from old freshwater deposits (like those of Nor-
folk) which existed, here and there, on the surface of the brown clay, at the time
the flint gravel was in progress of formation. The facts at any rate are interesting
and in the finer beds of gravel near Barnwell, these shells are found associated with
drifted mammals' bones of many species, most of which are extinct, e. g. Mammoth,
Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, gigantic Bos, Equus, &c. This association of fossils
is described in a paper by the Rev. T. B. Brodie, in the 'Cambridge Transactions,'
and the same fact was noticed twenty-five years since in a communication by

J, Okes, Esq.

            Modern Deposits connected with the present Drainage of the Country.

   The towns and villages upon the great level are generally built on hummocks of
the hrown clay, or on patches of the flint gravel, which raise them out of the reach
of the floods by which the lower fen-lands are occasionally submerged. The out-

crop of the lower greensand gives a swelling surface of dry land, so that its range

through the marshes may sometimes be traced by a line of villages and steeples. In
like manner the great outlier of lower greensand (the true Isle of Ely, which Wil-
liam the Conqueror could only reach by an artificial causeway across the marsh of
the Kimmeridge clay) is marked by the towers of Ely Cathedral and the steeples of
Wilburton and Haddenham. With the exception of these elevations, all the country

above described to the west of the chalk, is at a nearly dead level. Immediately
under the vegetable soil are found silt of various kinds, remains of ancient forests,
and bog-earth occasionally of considerable thickness. In some places the deposit is

simple, in others complex, indicating many successive changes in the condition of
drainage. Among these marsh lands are many traces of works by the hands of
man. But the most interesting remains are those which occur at the base of the
series, on the immediate surface of the older deposits, and they give an indication of
the condition of the country before the turf-bogs dammed up the old water-courses,
or the labours of man interfered with their distribution. Among these remains the
author only notices such as are found in the Cambridge collection, and to the in-
spection of which the Association was invited. Among these are the foUowing :

Bear, Wolf, Wild Boar, Beaver, Roe-buck, Red-deer, and the long-faced and straight-
horned gigantic Bos. The first two species are rare ; the last five are found in con-
siderable abundance. To this list might be added the bones of many species still
flourishing in the immediate neighbourhood. In the overlying marshes are occa-
sionally found many organic remains of living species and many curious remains of
ancient workmanship ; but their description came not within the objects of the
communication.

   The author exhibited a map of the Bedford Level for the purpose of explaining
some of the remarkable changes in the drainage of country during the last seven hun-
dred years. The older historical facts were chiefly derived from the descriptions and
charts of Dugdale and Badeslade, and they are briefly enumerated in the following

appendix to the paper.

                                                    Appendix.

Changes in the River Drainage of the Bedford Level, produced by the silting up of
   the old water-courses, and the consequent accumulation of Turf-hog and Marsh Lands,

The parts of the great level immediately bordering on the sea, from the mouth of

the Lynn river to the northern extremity of the Wash of Lincolnshire, chiefly consist

of marsh lands gained from the sea, partly by artificial embankments (some of very

ancient date), and partly by the natural encroachments of the increasing delta. But

as under such conditions the outfall of the several rivers was liable to silt up, and the

rivers themselves to shift their channels, it followed that many of the lower districts

in the interior of the great level must have been liable to continued inundations from

back-water. The consequence was, t{ie formation of extensive tracts of fen-land and

turf-bog through all the lower levels in the interior of the country. The following facts

are chiefly derived from Dugdale, 'On the History of Imbanking and Drayninge,'

and from Badeslade, 'On the Navigation of King's- Lynn and of Cambridge,' and are

given in this place for the purpose of showing how much the whole surface of a
delta may be changed, by alluvial accumulations, in course of a few hundred years.

In the early periods within the reach of authentic records (which go back more than

600 years, no notice being here taken of the old embankments made by the Romans),

the drainage of the great level was effected in the following manner :

1. By the channel of the Witham, which had then nearly the same course which

it has at the present time.

2. By the Welland river, which, after descending by Stamford, Crowland and

Spalding, united with the waters of the Glen in the estuary north of Holland fen.

3. By the Nene, which after passing Wansford and Peterborough, descended by

Whittlesea-meer, Ugg-meer and Ramsey-meer to Benwick, at which place it was

joined by the Old West-water, one of the branches of the Great Ouse*. From Ben-

wick it flowed on the north side of March and Doddington to Upwell, where it was

joined by the Welney river, then the principal channel of the Great Ouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      and from
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

Upwell the united waters proceeded directly to Wisbeach, anciently called Ousebeach,

and fell into the estuary.

4. By the Great Ouse, which, after passing Huntingdon and St. Ives, descended

to Erith (a village at the south-west end of the old and new Bedford rivers), where

it divided into two channels. One of them, called the Old West-water, ran to Ben-

wick, as before stated, and there united with the waters of the Nene. The other
channel, now called the Old Ouse (sometimes erroneously marked as the Old West-

water), descended by Cottenham fen, and was joined by the Cam a few miles above

Ely. The Old Ouse, after passing Ely, was joined by the Mildenhall river, and it
then passed, by the way of Littleport and Welney, to Upwell, where, as before stated,

it joined the waters of the Nene, and so descended to the sea at Wisbeach.

5. By the Little Ouse (once a very inconsiderable river), which (after passing

Brandon and being joined by some small tributary streams from the chalk hills of

old and new Bedford rivers), and ran to Benwick, not far from Ramsey- ineer. It was filled

up and had almost entirely disappeared so early as 1618, as is stated in the old surveys, and
it is never traced on any modern maps. The term Old West-water cannot therefore be cor«
rectly applied to the old course of the Ouse from Erith down Cottenham fen to Ely,

--Norfolk) fell into the sea at Lynn. In the preceding account all the old artificial

drains, and several minute bifurcations of the rivers, after they reached the great

alluvial delta, are intentionally omitted.

   As early as the 1 2th century the accumulations of alluvial silt near the mouths of
the Welland and Nene, caused a great back-water which overspread some of the

lower portions of the Bedford Level. The formation of great tracts of peat-bog was

the necessary consequence, by which the levels of the fen-lands were changed, and

the river courses still further interrupted                                                                                                                                                  and as early as the 13th century the out-
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

fall of the waters through some of the old channels had almost entirely failed. Mean-

time the bed of the Little Ouse, not having been exposed to the same accidents, was

much below the level of the great alluvial delta that extended to the mouths of the

Aother rivers above mentioned.                                                   great drain was therefore cut from Littleport Chair

to Rebeck, making the first direct communication between the Great and Little Ouse.
The effect was just what might have been anticipated. Not only the waters of the

Great Ouse, but the back-waters which had been pent up at a higher level in the

interior of the delta, descended with irresistible force through this new drain into

the channel of the Little Ouse, and so escaped into the sea at Lynn. About this

time the outfall below Spalding had so completely failed, that the waters of the
Welland found their way through the Catswater into the Nene ; and a reverse direc-
tion having been given to all the main currents, in consequence of a channel being

thus opened below the level of the ancient outfall at Wisbeach, all the back-waters of

the Welland, and all the united waters of the Nene, now flowed into the Great Ouse

through the Old West-water, through the Welney branch, and through all the great

cross-drains of the neighbouring countr}', and were then conveyed by the new cut into

the Little Ouse and so entered the sea at Lynn. In this way, for many years after-

wards, nearly all the waters of the great level, to the south of the Witham, had their

outlet at Lynn ; and the Little Ouse (now confounded with the Great Ouse), which

had formerly ruQ between banks not more than twelve perches asunder, became, in

consequence of the changes above mentioned, more than a mile wide. Many attempts

were made to prevent this unnatural discharge of nearly all the waters of the Bed-

ford Level by one channel at Lynn (formerly called, as before stated, the Little Ouse).

Thus, in 1292 several dams were constructed across the Upwell channel to prevent

the back-waters of the Nene from joining the Ouse. But they produced such ruin-

ous effects on many tracts of fen-lands, some of them bordering on the upper parts

of the Ouse itself, that in 1332 they were destroyed under the direction of a parlia-

mentary commission ; and for many years afterwards the great drainage of the delta
was effected in the manner above described. Notwithstanding the very indirect na-

ture of this drainage, which conveyed the greater part of the waters of the Welland,

the Nene and the Ouse into the sea by the Lynn channel, the fens appear, during
many subsequent years, to have been in a good condition, a fact which can only be

explained by the low level of the new outfall. In course of time however the new

channels began to silt up, and new works became necessary to prevent the ruinous

effects of the consequent back-water. In 1490 the discharge of the Ouse was par-

tially relieved by a cut (called Morton's Learn) from Peterborough to Guyhirn and

Wisbeach. It was intended to convey the waters of the Nene to their ancient out-

fall  at Wisbeach                                                   but  it was  never entirely effective                                                                                    till  the  year 1 638, when Ver-
                                                                 ;

muyden (under the direction of King Charles I.) erected high banks on each side of

the Leam, and opened out a better channel to the sea. Since then the Nene has

continued to flow, by its ancient out -fall, into the sea below Wisbeach. About the

same time other great works were undertaken and were continued in succession by

two Earls of Bedford. Two great cuts were made from Erith to Salter's Lode, a

distance of about twenty miles, and were completed in 1648. By these channels

(now called the old and new Bedford rivers) the waters of the Ouse, instead of their

former devious course by Cottenham and Ely, were conveyed, by two unbending lines,
down the great fen on the north-west side of the Ely and Haddenham outlier before

mentioned                                            and from Ely to Salter's Lode (near Denver) the old channel of the Ouse
                                                  ;

now carried only the waters of the Cam and its tributaries. These new works, how-

ever beneficial in other respects, appear from the first to have injured the low lands

bordering on the Cam, and the old channel of the Ouse between Ely aud Salter's

Lode ; for the new straight channels of the Ouse were not cut down to the level

of the old channel at Salter's Lode ; and the floods from the upper parts of the Ouse
commonly reached this spot, through the straight artificial channels, much sooner

Athan the floods of the Cam. new and unlooked-for evil was the consequence ; the
hanks of the Cam were continually liable to floods from the back-waters of the Ouse.
One great flood of the Ouse, in 1720, is said to have backed up the Cam from Sal-

ter's Lode, for twenty days, and to have silted up one part of the old channel below

Ely to the thickness of three or four feet. Ruinous effects of this kind were pre-

vented by the erection of various sluices, of which Denver sluice was most effective.

But although affording a cure for an immediate evil, and necessary to the internal

navigation of the Great Level, they have ultimately contributed to the very evil they

were intended to remedy ; for partly by their agency the whole bed of the Cam (as
well as of the old Ouse below Ely) was gradually silted up to a much higher level,

injurious to all the neighbouring fen-lands. The causes which produced these re-

markable changes continued to operate, and from time to time compelled the execu-
tion of new works. By way of conclusion, those works which have been eflFected

within the last thirty or forty years may be briefly noticed :

    1 . All the fen-lands, in the interior of every part of the great Bedford Level, are
so far above the mean level of the sea, that they might be effectually drained by
artificial cuts to low-water mark ; and the drainage might then be maintained per-

manently and effectually without the enormous expense of water-mills and other

artificial means. This has been partially effected by great works near the mouth of

the Witham, and by other similar works to the north of Morton's Learn, which

give a natural and uniform descent to the waters of Thorney fen and a part of South-

Holland fen.
   2. Within the same period a new channel has been cut for the Nene below Wis-

beach, and by an artificial embankment the upper part of the estuary has been gained

from the sea. Since then the lower part of the estuary has continued to warp up to
a higher level, and other artificial encroachments upon the sea are now in progress.

Had the bed of the Nene been lowered as far as Guyhirn, many thousand acres of

unreclaimed fen (including Whittlesea-meer) might have been drained by a direct cut
to that place. At present there is a violent rapid which conveys the waters of the
upper level to the level of the new river course below Wisbeach. In consequence
of this most injurious condition of the Nene, works are now in progress for the
drainage of Whittlesea-meer and the neighbouring fens by a longer and more indi-
rect cut to the lower part of the Ouse near Lynn.

  A3. great delta had been formed above Lynn during the time that the waters of

the Bedford Level were discharged (as above described) by the mouth of what was
once called the Little Ouse. This delta gave a slow discharge to the great land-
floods and caused much back-water. The artificial cut, called the Eau Brink, has in a

great measure abated this evil. Many large tracts of fen-lands (on the Cam and the
Ouse), which were once poisoned by stagnant water, are now well-drained and made

productive by a top-dressing of clay ; and floods, which formerly hung on these
lands for many weeks, now disappear in a few days.

   Local improvements, from the lowering of the river courses and the introduction

of steam-power, are not here noticed. Many of them are but local expedients to

meet an existing evil, which could not recur were a more uniform and systematic
drainage of the Great Level ever carried into eflfect. Enough has been stated in this
Appendix to explain the appearance of forest-trees and other indications of dry land
in many places of the Great Level, now sunk under many feet of bog-earth and allu-
vial silt : and if such remarkable effects have been thus produced by the accumula-
tions of alluvial matter and the growth of fen-land in the course of six or seven hun-
dred years, we may be well assured that the whole form of the neighbouring coast
must have been greatly changed in more ancient times by the same causes acting
without interruption and with less modification from the works of man.

On the occurrence of Silurian rocks at the villages ofOber and Neu Schmollen,
   near Breslau, in Silesia, and covering an area of about eight square Emrlish

the older palaeozoic rocks belonged almost exclusively to the carboniferous or Devo-
nian systems, and the country around Prague was the only one from which Silurian
fossils had been derived. It was a question whether this was really a little island of
Silurian rocks iti situ, or whether it was only a part of the drift of that region, which
often contained Silurian rocks derived from Scandinavia and Russia. In Mr. Oswald's
copious list of fossils were mentioued Illcenus crassicauda, Sphceronites, and other cha-
racteristic lower Silurian fossils, together with almost all the best-marked corals of
Wenlock and Dudley, a remarkable and unexpected mixture of the fossils of two
different members of the same series.

Tabular view of Fossil Plants. By Professor Goppert of Breslau.
                        Communicated by Mr. Murchison.

   Mr. Murchison announced the general results obtained by M. Goppert from the

formation of a tabular view of the fossil plants which had been discovered up to the

present time all over the globe. Mr. Murchison stated, that Professor Qoppert's

general resume of the fossil flora of the globe would be borne out by detailed proofs

about to be given in a general synopsis of well-known fossil species, animal and ve-
getable, now preparing by Bronn, Goppert and Herman von Meyer, and in which

these distinguished naturalists follow to a great extent the same plan as that published
by Mr.Morris in his 'Catalogue of British Fossils.' The number of fossil plants known
to M. Adolphe Brongniart in 183G, was 527- In the new list they amounted to 1792
and as in the 80,000 plants now known to exist in different parts of the globe, a large
proportion consists of fucoids and fungi and other tribes, which would disappear in
the process of fossilization, it would be seen that the total number of known fossil
species bore a more considerable proportion to those now existing than was com-

monly admitted. Their numerical distribution in the different rocks is stated by

M. Goppert to be as follows :

From this table it appeared, that the carboniferous group contained more than

half the known species of fossil plants, a remarkable circumstance when it was con-

sidered that the great herbivorous land quadrupeds had no ascertained existence be-

  On the Agency of Land Snails in forming holes and trackways in Compact
                             Limestone. By Dr. Buckland-

   This notice was a continuation of one made at the Plymouth meeting, in which
the author ascribed certain perforations discovered by him on the under side of
ledges of limestone rock at Tenby, Boulogne and Plymouth, to the agency of pro-
jecting the acid secretions of land snails, which resorted to these rocks daily for
shelter. The additional instances now described were discovered by Dr. Buckland

    * I beg to observe, that the plants here alliuled to undev the ter\n palseozoic, are all (with
the exception of a few fucoids) found in the rocks called Devonian, which lie immediately
at the base of the carboniferous system; no well-characterized land plants having yet been
observed in the Silurian or oldest palseozoic rocks. Some, indeed, of the so-called palaeozoic
plants of M. Goppert may, I suspect, belong to what English geologists term the " lower
limestone ^carboniferous) shale," which has very generally been merged with the grauwacke
of German geologists. I need scarcely remark, that the word " palaeozoic" is not here used
according to the sense in which most modern geologists would employ it, viz. as embracing
 the Silurian, Devonian, carboniferous and Permian deposits. li. I. Murchison.

man castle at Richborougb, made of Kentish rag ; in ihe roof of a cromlech of dolo-

mite at St. Nicholas, near Cardiff, and in the rock work in Mr. Dillwyn's garden of

mountain limestone brought from Gower. Dr. Buckland exhibited specimens of

limestone rock from several localities, showing perforations occupied by snails, and

grooves or furrows leading to the perforations, and he insisted that these were unlike

those produced by any marine animal, or by atmospheric causes. The perforated

rocks were stated to be only found in districts affording a rich vegetation, and were

always met with at the junction of a slate region, with one entirely composed of lime-

stone, and near luxuriant herbage. Dr. Buckland attached great importance to the

perforations at Richborough Castle, which, he said, afforded a measure of the time

necessary for such operations ; the deepest holes he had seen in limestone rocks

rarely exceeded three incnes, and he considered it probable that these had occupied

as many thousand years in their formation; the holes were only found in the hardest

limestone rocks, because in softer limestones they would be obliterated by atmo-

spheric action.

On the Coal Deposits of the Asturias. By S.IP. Pratt, F.R.S.

   Mr. Pratt gave a general account of a section taken from the neighbourhood of
Leon in a north-west direction to the coast passing through Oviedo. The strata
rise from beneath tertiary deposits which cover the plains of Leon and Castile, at an
angle of 30°, which soon becomes nearly vertical, dipping north by west. They con-

sist of numerous alternations of grit and shale with thin beds of limestone, and con-

tain within about three miles of their rise a bed of good coal, nearly nine feet thick.

Between this point and the summit of the Pass, a distance of five leagues, several

extensive faults occur, by which the dip is more than once reversed, and several large
mountain masses of limestone appear, underlying the grits, &c. ; this limestone con-

tains numerous fossils which indicate a period older than the mountain limestone,
although several species are found intermixed, which can scarcely be separated from it.

Hard grits and shales, highly inclined, succeed, and form the higher parts of the Pass,
extending about a league beyond it to the north, after which coal plants are found
abundantly in the grits and shales ; no coal however is seen until near Pola de Lena
situate about four leagues from the top of the Pass ; from hence following the road

to Oviedo, in a distance often miles, more than seventy seams of good workable coal
are crossed ; near the upper part of the series a bed of conglomerate occurs, formed

of rolled masses of grit, limestone, and coal ; another such deposit, probably ex-
ceeding 1500 feet in thickness, appears near the lowest part of the series, in which

the coal boulders are more abundant, varying from the size of an egg to a foot in dia-
meter, and possess the same character with the coal of the associated beds ; one good
coal-seam occurs in the conglomerate, and two or three below it. The coal deposits

are terminated by a narrow valley, beyond which the limestone rises from beneath

them to a considerable elevation ; a depression of the surface soon after occurs, form-

ing a plain of cretaceous deposits of the Hippurite period, upon which the city of

Oviedo stands, and which extends for twenty or thirty miles east and west. Beyond

Oviedo to the north, the limestone again rises, and coal deposits appear between this

point and the coast; in one of these the coal forms beds of from three to seven feet,

interstratified with the limestone, which, with the shales that occur in it, contains an

abundance of fossils, chiefly shells and corals, with but few traces of plants, whilst

those before mentioned in the series south of Oviedo, were chiefly Calamites, Sigillarice,

and Lepidodendra. Another of these deposits, containing the same fossils, crops

out on the sea-shore near the port of Aviles, which is to form the termination of the

North of Spain Railroad to Madrid. It appears therefore that, besides extensive coal-

beds corresponding with those of England and other countries, this province pos-

sesses a considerable deposit belonging to an earlier period, which was probably the

source of the boulders occurring in the conglomerate of the upper series. Connected

with the coal, and always below it, are several beds of haematite, one of which is ex-

traordinary, the pure unmixed ore being fifty feet thick, and extending for a consider-

able distance; it appears from its mineralogical character to have been a mechanical

or aqueous deposit.

            On the Geology of New Zealand. By Dr. Dieffenbach.

   New Zealand forms a group of mountainotis islands nearly as largo as England and

Wales, and its geological structure is rendered difficult of discovery by the primitive
forests that fringe the coast, or, where these have been destroyed, by impenetrable
thickets of the esculent fern. The fundamental rock is everywhere clay-slate, fre-
quently containing greenstone dykes, as at Port Nicholson, Queen Charlotte's Sound
and Cloudy Bay; in the neighbourhood of the dykes the clay-slate sometimes assumes

the character of a roofing-slate. On the banks of the rivers Eritonga and Waibo are

terraces, or horizontal plateaux, fifty feet high, formed of bcAiIders of the oldest trap-
 rocks, and similar terraces are seen on the sea coast round Cape Palliser, fifty or sixty
feet above the sea. Anthracite cdal crops out in the small harbour of Wangarrie on the
west coast of Middle Island, and there is a thin seam of anthracite in the hard gray
 sandstone on the east coast of the Northern Island. Limestone is described as oc-
 curring in the harbours of Kauria and Waingaroa on the west coast of the Northern
 Island ; it is crystalline, and contains fossils of the genera Pecten, Ostrea, Terebratula
 and Spatangus. Limestone is also found on the river Kaipara in the Bay of Islands, and
 copper pyrites has been obtained from the great Barrier Island, where it forms veins
 in the clay-slate. The coasts are in many places fringed with recent horizontal sedi-
 mentary deposits, consisting of loam, with fragments of wood and tree-ferns, blades
 of theTypha, &c.j and on the Northern Island the coast is often formed of volcanic
 conglomerate, containing magnetic iron sand near Cape Egmont, and TurritelltB and
 oyster shells at the harbour of Parenga; near Tauranga, it is composed of decom-
 posing tufa, containing lignite and shells of Pectunculus, Natica, Pyrvla and Ancil-
 laria. The small rocky islands of trachyte, lying oif the coast of Northern Island,
 also bear marks of wave-action to the height of 100 feet above the present sea level.

 On the western coast of this island formations of sand are now accumulating, driven

 over the forests by the prevalent westerly gales. The interior of the Northern Island
 affords but a scanty vegetation, and the surface is everywhere covered with ordinary
 volcanic productions, derived from the lofty central group of mountains, some of
 which are extinct, others still active volcanoes ; the lava appears to have been prin-
 cipally erupted from the base of the craters. The highest of these craters are Ton-
 gariro, 6000 feet in elevation, according to Mr. Bidwell, and Mount Egmont about
 9000 feet, by Dr. Dieffenbach's thermometrical observations. There are also many
 lakes which appear to occupy ancient craters. The mountain chains of the Middle
 Island are supposed to consist of primary rocks; quartzose sandstone and gray-
 wacke are met with at the height of 3000 feet ; the lofty pyramidal summits are co-
 vered with snow, and deep narrow valleys separate the various ridges, and radiate
 from the central cones. Dr. Diefl^enbach enumerates many localities at which he
  observed mineral springs, particularly between the Bay of Islands and Hokianga,
  where their temperature varied from 124'' to 154^, and having an alkaline taste;
  the surface was covered with sublimations of sulphur. Along the delta of the Waikato,
  hot springs rise from the escarpments of the hills, forming deposits like those of
  Iceland and St. Michael, Azores, containing 75 per cent, of silica. There is also a
  cold silicifying spring near Cape Maria.

      Dr. Dieffenbach has examined into all the traditions respecting the existence of

 the Moa, or great bird of New Zealand, and concludes that it has never been seen
 alive by any natives of New Zealand ; the rivers in which its bones have been found

  flow between banks from thirty to sixty feet high, and as they are continually chan-

 ging their course the remains of the Moa may have been derived from tertiary fluvia-

   tile strata.

reputed riches. Manoa, the capital of El Dorado, was said to be built on a large
lake, which Hondius first represented in his map of Guiana as 200 leagues long and
forty broad, assigning as its locality the isthmus between the Rupununi and Rio
Branco; subsequent geographers retained the Laguna Parima, or Mar Blanco, but
varied its locality ; and although Humboldt, by reasoning founded upon personal
experience and the inspection of every document relating to the country, asserted

that such a lake could have no real existence, yet within the last few years maps
have been published upon which the lake still figures. At the time Humboldt pub-
lished his Atlas, the regions north of the Amazon, three times as large as Spain, were
unknown. It was this country which the author had been engaged in exploring since

1835, and the large maps which illustrated his paper proved the correctness of Hum-
boldt's judgement. The fable of the " Mar Bianco " had doubtless arisen from the an-

nual inundations of the vast savannahs between the Rupununi and Rio Branco and the
Pacaraima Mountains and the thick forests of Essequibo, covering an extent of 14,000
square miles. These might once have formed an inland lake, but not within the histo-
ric period. The author then gave a sketch of the geography of Guiana, which,
although the largest British colony in South America, was so little known as to be
sometimes spoken of as an island. The province is bounded in its widest extent by
the rivers Amazon and Orinoco, and comprises an area of 690,000 square miles ; the
Casiquiare canal connects the Orinoco with the Rio Negro and the Amazon; so that,
in this way, the province may be circumnavigated. The fertility of the country is
surprising to those accustomed only to the vegetation of the temperate zone ; but
the author gives it as his opinion, that no natives of the north of Europe could endure
the climate as labourers in the open air. The rivers of Guiana, aided by short over-
land portages, afford inland communication with Monte Video at the mouth of the
La Plata, with Cuzio, Lima, and Santa Fe de Bogota. The Parime and Pacaraima
Mountains separate the fertile plains of the Lower Orinoco from those of the Rio
Negro and the Amazon; the loftiest summits are in the most southern ranges, and
in those most northerly. Maravacca, near the Orinoco, rises to 11,000 feet, and
Roraima, the culminating point of the Pacaraima Mountains, is 8000 feet above the
sea; they are composed of the older red sandstone, and exhibit mural cliffs 1000 and
1600 feet high. From the walls of the latter mountains the river Kamaiba precipi-
tates itself, in a cascade of nearly 1500 feet, surpassing the Cascade de Gavarnie in
the Pyrenees, which is 1266 feet. In the neighbourhood of these mural mountains,
porphyry, jasper and rock crystals are found.

Notice and Drawings of the Footprints of various Animals on the New Red
        Sandstone of Corncockle Muir. By H. E. Strickland, F.G.S.

    On Nodules, apparently Coprolitic, from the Red Crag, London Clay,
                      and Greensand. By Professor Hknslow.

   The supply of phosphate of lime used in agriculture, and hitherto obtained from
bones, having of late years become insufficient, Dr. Daubeny had been induced to
visit Spain, in order to learn whether this deficiency could be supplied from the de-
posit of phosphorite in Estremadura. From his report, there appeared to be diffi-

culty attending the project ; but so important was it deemed, that a second expedi-
tion had been made for the sake of further investigation. In October 1843, Prof.
Henslow had called attention to the occurrence of phosphate of lime in pebbly beds

of the red crag at Felixstow, in Suffolk; these nodules, though extremely hard, pre-
sented external indications of an animal origin, and yielded, upon analysis, 56 per
cent, of phosphate of lime. Mr, Brown of Stanway, had subsequently obtained

several analysesof these pebbles,and also of similar nodules obtained from the London
clay in the vicinity of Euston-square, and found the same amount of phosphate of
lime, viz. 50 or 60 per cent, in each. The crag pebbles occasionally contain re-
mains of small crabs and fish like those in the London clay, leading Mr. Brown to
the conclusion that they were derived from the destruction of certain beds of that
series. The crag nodules were so abundant, that a gentleman had obtained two tons

of them--which, after being prepared, were found upon analysis to contain 53 per

                                                                          e2

cent, phosphate of lime ; 13 phosphate of iron, and the remainder carbonate of lime
and volatile matter. The stratum of greensand, with similar nodules, had been de-
scribed by Mr. Sedgwick ; although never more than a foot thick, it occurred near
the surface over many square miles in the vicinity of Cambridge; and the pebbles it
contained yielded 61 per cent, of earthy phosphates and 24 of carbonate of lime, the
rest being insoluble. These were also considered to be possibly coprolitic by Mr.
Henslow; they frequently contained vertebrae and teeth of fishes, crab-shells, and
other substances, apparently half-digested. In illustration of the origin of such ex-
tensive layers of coprolitic matter in the marine formations, Mr. Henslow read a
notice respecting the Appearance of Sharks on the Coast of Norway.

On the Mechanical /Action of Animals on Hard and Soft Substances during
           the Progress of Stratification. By the Rev. Dr. Buckland.

    Dr. Buckland remarked, that remains of animals which perforate rocks and or-
ganized substances for their shelter and abode were almost unknown in the older
strata, but that many instances occurred in the secondary period of extensive rock

surfaces covered with the holes of boring shells and worms. A familiar example oc-

curred at Vallis near Frome, where the mountain limestone, covered by the inferior

oolite, was penetrated by the bivalve mollusks and annelids. A similar instance oc-
curs at Marquise near Boulogne ; and it is not uncommon to find thick shells and

fragments of saurian bone perforated or incrusted by parasitic animals. Similar ope-
rations mi^ht be observed on our own coasts at the present time, some of the animals
apparently making holes only by the accidental circumstance of living on one spot
 for a long time, as in the case of the limpet and Echinus saxatilis; others, like the
 Pholas and Lithodomus, requiring it as a necessary condition of their existence.

     On the Subsidence of the Land at Puzznoli. By James Smith, F.G.S.

   When the writer visited the temple of Jupiter Serapis at Puzzuoli, in March 1819,

 its floor was elevated about six inches above the level of the sea ; but on the ] 1th

 of May in the present year, it was covered to the depth of eighteen inches at low

 water, and twenty-eight and a half at high tide ; the sea being calm at the time.
 The custode of the building told Mr. Smith that this change was progressive, amount-
 ing to one English inch and a quarter per annum. The cicerone, too, who had ex-
 ercised his profession for thirty years, said he knew a difference of at least three feet
 six inches in the height of the sea upon the piers of the bridge of Caligula, giving
 the same amount of subsidence yearly. There were, besides, many similar proofs in
 the partly submerged houses and causeways of Puzzuoli. The author adds some
 notices of the evidence of both gradual and sudden elevations having at different
 times affected Puzzuoli.

On the Methods of Working and Ventilating the Coal-mines of tJie North of

   England, with reference to the Accidents that occur in such Mines from the

   Explosion of Firedamp. By Professor Ansted, M.A., F.R.S., Vice-

     Sec. G.iS., |e.

   The object of this communication was partly to explain the methods of working
coal adopted in the Newcastle coal-field, and partly to suggest certain methods
which, in the author's opinion, were calculated to diminish the risk of accidents
arising from the explosion of firedamp, without interfering with the oeconomical
working of the mines.

   In the district in question, the extent of coal worked by one company and from a
single pair of shafts is very considerable, amounting, in fact, in some cases, to as much
as 1000 acres. The depth of the sinkings is enormous, Ijeing rarely less than 150
fathoms, and sometimes upwards of 300. The competition amongst the various
proprietors is very great, and the expense of sinking such deep shafts, often through
untried ground and with a vast body of water pouring in from quicksands, is so
enormous, that there seems no hope of adding very considerably to the number of
the shafts in each minej nor does the author consider that to increase this number
beyond certain limits would diminish to any extent the danger of explosion.

   The coal in the north of England and elsewhere is well known to give off during
working a considerable quantity of light carburetted hydrogen, and occasionally, it is
supposed, a small quantity of olefiant and sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and when the
gases thus given off are mixed with a certain quantity of ordinary atmospheric air,
they become highly explosive.

   The ordinary processes of ventilation, effected by placing a furnace at the bottom
of one shaft, or one compartment of a shaft, and thus causing a current of air to
descend another shaft, and move with a regulated rapidity through all the work-
ings, were described by the author as sufficient for the carrying off the gases thus

liberated under ordinary circumstances ; but besides these there are occasionally
met with sudden and violent puffs of gas, called blowers, proceeding either from
faults or from cavities in the coal, and against them no process of ventilation is a
sufficient safeguard. Owing also to the nature of the associated strata, and the
great depth of the workings, it happens that when workings have been carried on to
any extent under ground, a considerable portion of the district left empty by the
extraction of the coal is partially filled by the broken roof, which, however, not
occupying the space entirely, affords cavities, sometimes of great size, into which the
lighter inflammable gases naturally collect, and there become slowly mixed with at-
mospheric air. Such cavities therefore are often full of explosive mixture, ready to
take fire at any instant, and occasionally, owing to a change in the pressure of the
air, or from other causes, the explosive mixture actually emerges into those pas-
sages in which open lights are used and causes accidents. Each of these spaces,
filled with rubbish, and thus forming a magazine of foul air, is called, technically, a

  mReferring to the explanation of the nature and action of the goaf, as given the

' Report on the Haswell Explosion' by Messrs. Lyell and Faraday, the author ex-
pressed his opinion that in the north of England there is not such a degree of
regularity in the mechanical limits and condition of this goaf as would admit of any
separate system of ventilation or gas-draining for such pans of a mine, and he also
urged that the rise side of the goaf was by no means always the place of danger, or
the origin of accidents in the greater number of instances.

   The author then suggested the following methods to be generally introduced in
working coal mines :

  --1. The having at least two shafts in each colliery. This is absolutely essential, and,

though generally acted on, requires to be enforced in every instance, since in case of
an accident in a mine with only a single shaft, it is extremely probable that the par-
titions at the bottom will be blown away, and thus all those persons employed in
parts which the explosion has not reached will almost necessarily perish, since the
ventilation is instantly stopped by the accident, or only the poisonous air called
after-damp circulates through the workings. Besides this there are many accidents
to which a pit is liable, such as the falling in of brick-work, &c., which, by pre-
--54 REPORT 1845.

venting the necessary communication, may cause the death of the men under ground
if there is no way of escape.

    2. The working panels of moderate and regulated dimensions, so that no air-course

--shall be of greater length than a given distance. It is well known that in the method

formerly in use of coursing the air through all tlie main passages of a mine, there
were often instances in which the air had to pass through from fifty to seventy miles,
or even more, between the downcast and upcast shafts. Since it has been found
that the quantity of air introduced by a shaft of given magnitude can be very much
increased by dividing the underground current into several currents, each taking a
different direction, the length of the air-courses in well-managed mines has been
greatly reduced, and is now rarely more than three or four miles. The advantage
of this is manifest; but although the principle is generally acknowledged, there is
good reason to believe that many collieries are worked without regard to such im-
proved methods. Besides the greater quantity of air actually introduced by thus
splitting the current, the destruction of life consequent upon an explosion may be
also much diminished thereby, provided the detached portions of work caWed panels
are of moderate size, and do not so communicate with one another as to render it
impossible to escape from any one to the pit bottom without passing through air
affected by the condition of the rest.

   The author added, with reference to these two methods, that they were already
adopted to a very great extent in the well-regulated collieries of the Newcastle coal-
field, and rather needed to be enforced in some cases of exception than be looked
upon as expressing any new views.

    Passing on then to the case of the great explosion in the Haswell colliery on the
28th September 1844, the author pointed out that of the whole number of sufferers
on that occasion, not less than thirty might have been saved had there been a free
separate communication to the bottom of the downcast shaft .Itom a panel adjoining
that in which it is presumed the accident happened. Since accidents must happen
occasionally, it is manifestly extremely important that their fatal results should be as
far as possible limited to the actual spot in which they occur, and not involve, as
they have frequently done, the lives of those at work in distant parts of the pit.
It is therefore proposed that

   An3. air-drift should be cut from each separate panel communicating with the
bottom of the downcast shaft. The driving a gallery through coal is not looked on as

any expense in working, since the coal extracted pays for the work done, and this
method is therefore suggested as a practical, inexpensive, and efficient method of
avoiding at least some of the fatal results when an explosion does take place.

   But the author does not consider that the working of the pillars and the vicinity of
the goaf is by any means the most usual cause of such emissions of gas as lead to explo-
sions, and he quoted the example of a recent explosion in the Killingworth colliery,
which took place on the 16th of April, as an instance in point. Then, and in many other
explosions on record, the immediate cause of danger arose from a sudden outburst
of gas in workings where the coal had onlj-been recently laid bare, and where a small
fault was met with. These outbursts of gas, called, XocaWy^bloivers, are sudden, and
often instantaneous, giving no warning whatever of their approach, and therefore
not to be guarded against. The ventilation, as now effected, being generally suf-
ficient for all purposes, it could not, the author believes, be so far increased as to
prevent accidents from these eruptions of gas, while, on the contrary, it might happen
that by a more rapid admixture with pure air and quicker transmission of the explo-
sive current through a great part of the air-course, greater damage might arise than
even now, when flame was reached and the gas became fired. In such cases, and in
all mines where any quantity of gas is expelled by blowers, the author considers that
there is only one means of safety to be adopted, namely,

   4. The exclusive use of the Davy lamp in all undergroimd workings in fiery mines.
   " This is a measure which at present has scarcely been adopted in full in any mine,
but which is certainly well worthy of consideration. There may be mentioned, I
am aware, two very different objections to its use, but I have good reason to believe
that neither of them is very valid, and I am therefore anxious to press most earnestly
on the consideration of all those engaged in coal-mining operations the importance
of this plan. It will be said, on one hand, that the expense is too great, and that the men

                                                                                                  I

object; and, on the other hand, t^at the Davy is by no means a perfect instrument.
To the first objection I can refer in reply to the experience of more than one of the

best-regulated collieries of the north of England, where a vast number of Davys are

in daily use: about 130 of these instruments being employed in the Wallsend pit,
and in others a still larger number. The workmen also on the whole prefer to work

at the same wages with the rest with the comparatively obscure light and the greater

danger, because the coal is somewhat more tender. To the other objection, that the
Davy is useless, I can only say, that with regard to all cases of explosive mixture that
have been fairly met with underground, and all rates of motion hitherto attempted,

the united experience of wastemeu and viewers for the last thirty years cannot but

be considered of some value, and is unanimously, as far as I can learn, on the side
of its great practical value. I have trusted my own life to these instruments, and

would do so again without the slightest hesitation, provided of course that proper
care is employed. The instrument is simple, easily kept in order, and what is per-

haps of yet more importance, easily and quickly examined j and if, as is done in well-
regulated pits, the gauze of every lamp was examined and locked before being de-

livered to the men, I cannot believe that an accident could happen except by such

a falling of the roof as would injure the gauze, and this would also destroy every

other contrivance hitherto imagined for giving safe light.

  " In conclusion, I am anxious to express my own firm conviction that no great im-

provement can take place in coal-working generally without some external interfe-
rence. The coal trade is now hardly remunerative; it is a struggle in which every

one endeavours to bring into the market saleable coal at a low price, and a struggle

obliging those concerned to compete with the utmost energy. Such a state of things

is not likely to admit of any great improvement of the kind here advocated, since

the supply of labour is greater than the demand, and few proprietors will be found
to risk money where the return is so doubtful. But the interests at stake are not
only those of monied men; the lives of thousands and the well-being of the popula-

tion of large districts are also involved, and it is the duty of goverimient to watch

over and protect these. This can be done properly only by a most careful super-

intendence over all those engaged in the employment. It ought to be considered

absolutely necessary that ventilation should be conducted in every individual mine

on the best principles, and that in each the safety of the pitman should be secured

by insisting on every reasonable means of preventing accidents being equally adopted

by all. But this can only be done by the interference of government, and even the
full necessity of it can only be learnt by a strict and careful investigation, since it
would be impossible to ascertain otherwise how far the greater number of the col-

lieries (amounting in the Newcastle district to nearly 200) are properly conducted

or not.

  " My object has been to show that much may be done by simple, practical and in-

expensive methods to diminish the loss of life in collieries arising from noxious
gases. Experiments however are still greatly needed, not only in picked mines, where
the ventilation is as good as under the circumstances it can be, but also in the nu-

merous other pits little heard of, but still employing an important proportion of the
whole colliery population. These experiments should be made with a view to the
solution of various questions not at present fully determined, among which I would

instance-- (1) the actual nature of the gas given oif by the coal where the singing noise

is chiefly heard ; (2) the real extent to which splitting the air may be carried with a

view  to shortening  the  air-courses                                   (3)  the  extent of the ventilation  at  the  floor,                                                                                                                                                                                        the
                                                                     ;

walls and the roof of a mine when an ordinary current is passing along the middle.

I mention these, but they are only a few among many points hitherto undecided in

coal-working, and jet bearing most importantly on the subject of ventilation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        but I
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

might greatly extend the list, and I feel quite certain that when the attention of com-

petent chemists and practical geologists is directed not only to the goaf, which I must

consider, from documentary evidence, as among the least important subjects of inves-

tigation, but also to the whole coal when first worked, and the small hitches and faults

so abundant in every coal-field, there will be accumulated a heap of evidence bearinu-

on these points and leading ultimately to some important practical result. At present

I can only suggest the methods which have struck me as at once reasonable and use-

ful,--I mean the not working too large an area of coal from one pair of shafts ; never
                   ;;

--56 REPORT 1845.

working at all with less than a pair; working the panels or districts of coal perfectly
distinct from one another, and each communicating by its own drift with the upcast;
and the working in fiery mines only with the safety-lamp and with no open lights
whatever. These are all points which are in the strictest sense of the words, practi-
cal and ceconomical. They would not entirely prevent the occurrence of accidents ;

nor do I believe that any human means can ever do so, for so long as men are care-
less and ignorant, so long will this carelessness and ignorance produce its usual effects
but they would, 1 am convinced, diminish greatly the frequency of accidents, while
they would diminish also, in some measure, their extent; and these are certainly
objects, the attainment of which would be in the highest degree important and

advantageous."

On the Fossil Bodies regarded by M. Agassiz as the Teeth of a Fish, and
  upon which he has fo%inded his sujiposed genus Sphenonchus. By Edward

   Charlesworth, F.G.S.

   The object of this communication was to call attention to the history of the fossil
bodies from the lias and newer secondary rocks, upon the character of which M.
Agassiz proposes to establish a new genus, under the supposition that they are teeth
but he adduces no facts in support of this view, nor does he attempt to invalidate
the previously published evidence in favour of their being dermal spines. Mr.
Charlesworth considers that an Ichthyolite in the possession of Mr. E. T. Higgins of
Clifton, in addition to other evidence which he has collected upon the subject, is

conclusive as to the fact of these fossil bodies being spines, and not teeth.
   Mr. Charlesworth then made some observations on the occurrence of otolites in

the London clay and coralline crag.

A method of exhibiting, at one view, the results of a given Geological Survey.

  By Francis Whishaw, Civil Engineer, Secretary of the Society of Arts.

The author, after noticing Mr. Sopwith's system of modelling, thus describes his

own process. The modeller, having before him a plan of the district of country to

be represented, with all the necessary sections and levels (the plan and sections

being drawn to suitable scales), provides a base or foundation of wood about three

quarters of an inch larger all round than the plan of the district to be modelled :

this foundation must be well-clamped to prevent it from warping. It must then be

prepared to receive a coating of papier mache, or other suitable material, to be

moulded into the proper shape, corresponding with the lower stratum or strata to

be represented in the model. Longitudinal and cross sections, showing accurately

the strata, having been already prepared, slips of glass are to be provided correspond-

ing in shape with the various sections, which are to be traced on the glass, painted,

and burnt in in the usual manner. The various sections of glass are to be let into

grooves cut in the foundation, and cemented thereto, and the vertical edges of the

several pieces of glass, when meeting together, are to be cemented by means of

Whenmarine glue.  the vertical glass sections are all fixed in their relative posi-

tions, it is necessary to provide a lid or cover for the whole, which I have thought

may also be made of glass, but at any rate wood will answer; if of glass, the surface

of the country will be made of the same material, the rivers, buildings, &c. being

coloured and burnt in according to the taste of the modeller; but if wood is used, it

must be superposed hy papier mache or other suitable material, already used by

modellers, and the mountainous parts, rivers, churches and other buildings, repre-

sented in the usual manner. In the lower part of the cover grooves must be formed,

answering to the different glass sections, so as to cover in the whole in a compact

form ; ivory or metal scales, to measure distances and depths, will complete the con-

trivance.

Some Remarks on the Structure and Relations of Cornulites, and other allied

                    Silurian Fossils. By J. W. Salter, A.L.S.

   The anomalous nature of tlie fossils in question having led to great diversity of

opinion with regard to their place in the system, the author endeavours to trace out
their affinity from the internal structure. The Cornulites serpularius, Schl., ranges
through the Silurian rocks of Gothland, Britain and North America, and is most

abundant in the Wenlock limestone. Its general form is that of an elongate, knotted,
thick tube, four or five inches long, appearing like a pile of conical cups, placed one
in the other, the highest at the small end of the shell. The interior cast has a similar
appearance. The shells, in the young state, grow in pairs attached to corals and

other bodies : they are covered with a thin coat, finely striated lengthwise; beneath
this the edges of the cups or nodes appear covered with concave pits ; two or three
raised lines run along various portions of the inner surface.

   The step-like form of the nodes or varices gives it some resemblance to the stems
of Crinoidea, to which family Eichwald and Hisinger have referred it; and Dr. Vol-
borth of Berlin has published a memoir identifying our fossil with the tapering,
jointed stems of Echinocrinus, which it imitates in form and in the ornamented

surface. In ordinary testaceous moliusks, the laminae of growth, and consequently
the varices, are conical, with their bases towards the aperture of the shell, and it is
the apparently reversed position in this case which appears to have misled naturalists.
But in truth the growth is not reversed ; a longitudinal section shows that at each
varix the laminae are more distant than on the sides of the cups, and also bullated
or puckered up, leaving cells in the interstices ; it is just such a form as would result
from the periodical advances of an animal with a large inversely conical head in its
shell. The mantle would corrugate in the space left behind it, and the shelly matter
grow on this as a mould. Instances of this occur in the septa of Cirrus, Serpula?
polythalamia, and the large interlaminar spaces in the shells of Ostrea, Spondylus, &c.
Its analogy with corals, to which a most excellent naturalist, J. D. C. Sowerby, has
referred it with doubt, seems incomplete : if it be regarded as a single polype, there
are no internal plates or rays, or if the separate cells be those of polypes, they are
without ostiolae, or if they had them, they must have opened exteriorly, where they

are covered by a striated film. On the whole, it bears much more analogy to the

SerpviincE, in the attachment of the young shell and its gregarious habits.
    The other group noticed is that of the Tentaculites of Schlotheira, of equal or

greater range in the Silurian system, and consisting of several species. They have
many points in common with Cornulites, but their exterior is more symmetrical; a
section longitudinally will show the thickened and inverted cup-shaped nodes on the
cast ; but the laminse are not undulated at these parts, and the greater thickness there
is all that indicates a looser texture ; observations with the microscope will determine
this point. The unjointed tube sufficiently separates them from the Crinoidea, as
does also their conical terete form. Schlotheim, who first described both them and
the Cornulites, refers them to that family, supposing they formed a coronet of brachia.
Goldfuss has also assigned them to Cyathocrinites pinnatus as auxiliary side-arms.
It is possible they might be straight moUusca like Dentalium, but neither in their ex-
terior or internal characters do they resemble that genus; and they have so many
points in common with Cornulites, that, if this be accepted as belonging to the Ser-
pulina, they must be admitted also as free members of the same family. They are
certainly never attached ; and it would be a curious, though not a solitary fact in
palaBontology, that the earliest forms of a genus should exhibit a complex structure,
and a variation from the general type of their successors. Systematic zoologists will
determine whether the structures indicated claim distinction for the Cornulitidce as
a separate family, a subsection of the Sei-pulince, and whether they should be divided
into the free and attached groups.

On the results of recent Researches into the Fossil Insects of the Secondary
        Formations of Britain. By H. E. Strickland, M.A., F.G.S.

Fossil insects were, till recently, very little known in the secondary rocks of Britain,

and the only examples were those from the Stonesfield slate, one from the lias, and

a few from the coal measures. The very large additions to our knowledge of fossil

entomology, made by the Rev. P. B. Brodie, have been derived from two principal

groups, the Wealden and the lias. In the Wealden no less than seventy-four insect

forms have been described and figured by Mr. Westwood from Mr. Brodie's speci-

mens. These are generally remarkable for their small size, from which, and from

their zoological characters, Mr. Westwood infers that they belong to a temperate

climate. The gigantic beetles, locusts and Cicadce of our modern tropics are here

wanting, and the specimens consist, with very few exceptions, of small Curculionida,

TipulcE,TAbellulcB and Aphides, such as swarm at this moment in European climates.

This then is a very remarkable fact, when taken in connection with the gigantic

reptiles and remarkable forms of vegetable life which occur in the Wealden forma-

Wetion, and which by analogy we must refer to a tropical climate.      must either

suppose, what is scarcely conceivable, that insects of European forms could co-exist

with tree-ferns and other tropical productions, or what is perhaps more probable,

that the insects of a cooler climate floated down some vast river into the great Wealden

aestuary, just as the insects of Upper Canada or the Rocky Mountains might be car-

ried by the Mississippi, in the present day, into juxtaposition with the alligators anil

palm-trees of the Gulf of Mexico. A similar anomaly is presented by the insects,

first discovered by Mr. Brodie, and afterwards collected by Mr. Hope, the author, and

others, in the lower lias of Gloucestershire and the adjacent counties. Of many

hundred specimens examined by Mr. Westwood, the whole present indications of a

temperate climate, a conclusion wholly opposed to that which we are accustomed

Weto draw from the vertebrate and molluscous fauna of the sam.e epoch.  must

here, as in the case of the Wealden insects, reconcile this apparent discrepancy by

supposing that the insects were drifted from cooler cHmates to the spots where we

now find them. There are probably no organic bodies of such delicate structures

which are capable of floating to so great distances as insects ; their extreme lightness,

and the strong materials of which their corneous parts consist, would enable them to

float down rivers and to be difFased far and wide over the sea, there to be imbedded
with truly marine products. In conformity with this view, we find that the insects

of the Wealden, and still more so of the lias, consist chiefly of Coleoptera and other

strongly compacted forms, that they most commonly present only detached portions

of the entire insect, and such portions (chiefly wings and wing-cases) as are the most

compact and durable. There is therefore no doubt that these insect remains have

been drifted from the land into the sea, in other words, from higher ground to lower

and we have only to suppose that the original habitat of these insects was sufficiently

elevated to supply them with a cool or temperate climate, and the whole difficulty

is removed.

Another very unexpected result of the examination, by a skilful entomologist, of

these fossil insects, is the remarkable affinity which they present to existing forms

even in so ancient a deposit as the lias, we find no insects of decidedly new types of

organization ; they are in almost every instance referrible to families, and frequently
to genera, which belong to the existing fauna. In one instance only has Mr. West-

wood ventured to propose a new generic name, and it is remarkable that the pecu-

liar form so indicated is common both to the Wealden and the lias. It would ap-

pear, therefore, that from the time of the lias to the present day, the class Insecta

has undergone a far less amount of alteration, either by the extinction of old forms

or the introduction of new, than any other large group of the animal or vegetable
kingdom with which we are acquainted. It was indeed well known that the different

classes of the animal kingdom vary greatly in what we may call their amount of

durability; that the higher groups of vertebrata, for instance, present a rapid suc-

cession of forms as we descend the chronological scale, while certain molluscous and

infusorial structures are continued with little or no change during vast geological

periods; but perhaps there is no other instance of so remarkable a persistency of

character in a whole class of animals, as that which is presented to us in comparing

the insects of the lias and Wealden with those of the existing fauna.

On a remarkable Phcenomenon 'presented hy the Fossils in the JFreshrvater Ter-

    tiary ofthe IslandofCos. ByPtofessov E. Forbes and Lieut. Sfrati',R,N,

    In the island of Cos there is an extensive deposit of freshwater tertiary strata, ap-
parently agreeing in age with the freshwater tertiaries of Lycia, which the authors had
shown to be of an age subsequent to the miocene, and certainly of older date than the
newer pliocene period, as these freshwater beds are anterior to and form the uncon-
formable wails of a well-defined marine formation, containing numerous newer plio»
cene fossils. In the freshwater strata are found abundant and well-preserved shells
of the genera Paludina, Neritina, Melanopsis, Melania, Valvata and Unio. Examples
of the first three of these genera are most numerous, and are found throughout the
vertical extent of the formation, distributed in three successive series of horizons.
In each of these horizons is a species of Paludina and of Neritina, and in each of the
two lower ones are two species of Melanopsis. The lowermost species of each genus
are smooth, those of the centre partially plicated, and those of the upper part
strongly and regularly ribbed. The forms of the examples of these several genera
in the several zones are so very distinct and well-marked, that at first examination it
would appear that each series of horizons was characterized by a Paludina, Neritina
and Melanopsis of its own and representative of each other. If the species are re-
garded as distinct, either such conclusion must become to, involving the supposition
of a succession of creations and extinctions during the (geologically) short period in
which the lake existed, or a transmutation of species must be maintained.

   The authors propose the following solution of this geological problem without
having recourse to such extreme suppositions. In the uppermost part of these beds

there is evidence of the influx of the sea converting the fresh into brackish water.

The Cardium edule occurs there. Finding that the smooth shells of several existing
mollusca under such conditions become distorted and plicated, they are inclined to
refer the appearances described to such a cause, and to regard these three Paludince
as one species : so also with the other genera. Referring to the facts made known
by Mr. Forbes, that races of mollusca cannot remain for more than a limited time
on the same horizontal area, though they may reappear when the ground is suffi-
ciently changed, ^their embryos, which have been swimming free under a rudimentary
and pteropodous state, in the meantime developing themselves on the new ground,)
the authors hold that, by the time the ground was renewed for the development of

the progeny, of the lowermost of the Paludince for instance, the composition of the
water had changed so far as to affect, though not destroy, their form during their
development ; and that this was again and still more the case when the germs of
the middle Paludince, &c. assumed the last form under which the several species
appeared.

Abstract of a Paper on the Physico- Geographical Description of Mount Etna.
                           By Baron von Waltershausen.

Baron von Waltershausen began his researches in the year 1835, accompanied by

Professor Listing of Gottingen, and continued them on his second journey during the

years 1838 to 1843 with M. Peters of Flensburg and M. Cavallari of Palermo.

The fruits of his labours are in the course of being published under the title, ' The

AEtna and its Revolutions.'  large atlas will accompany this work, with an intro-

duction written both in German and French. The principal object will be to give

an exact representation of the mathematical, physical and geographical relations of

Mount Etna, including an accurate historical survey of all the different eruptions,

beginning from the earliest times up to the year 1843. The atlas, engraved by M.

Cavallari, of which the first section has just been published, will contain a topogra-

phical and geological map of this volcano on the scale of 1 in 50,000, besides a large

number of views, sections and other interesting details. The author hopes to be

able to give a complete theory of the formation of the mountain and the revolutions

it has undergone in the course of time, and to have arrived, by comparison with other

volcanoes of Southern Europe (Vesuvius, the Liparian Islands), to results applicable

to volcanoes in general. It may, perhaps, be stated that in this work, which the

author considers as the principal labour of his life, the first attempt will be made to

put the observation of geological phsenomena on a mathematical foundation.

     On the Occurrence of the Mosasaurus in the Essex Chulk, and on the Discovery
        of Flint within the Pulp- cavities of its Teeth. By Edward Charleswokth,

          F.G.S.

          This communication relates to the Saurian teeth figured in the * Odontography' of

     Professor Owen under the generic name Leiodon, and to a fragment of a jaw of this

      reptile in Mr. Charlesworth's possession from one of the chalk quarries on the banks
      of the Thames. Mr. Charlesworth contends that there are no grounds to warrant

     the establishment of the genus Leiodon. He refers the teeth described under that
      name to the genus Mosasaurm, and proposes the specific name stenodon (narrow-

       toothed) to distinguish the English fossil from its congener, the Mosasaurus Hoffvianni,

    A section of the jaw made at right angles to its long axis, and through one of the

      conical bases upon which the teeth are implanted, exposed a piece of black flint,

     filling the extension of the pulp-cavity into the substance of the jaw. Two more of

      the pulp-cavities, upon being laid open, exhibited the same phsenomenon ; in one
       case the flint filling the entire cavity, so as to occupy the hollow of the tooth itself;
      but no deposit of flinty matter had taken place in the bony material of the jaw.
      Mr. Charlesworth considers that the discovery of flint under these remarkable cir-
       cumstances is strong presumptive evidence in favour of its having been deposited
     from an aqueous solution, and is opposed to the respective theories advanced by M.
      Ehrenberg and Mr. Bowerbank to explain the formation of flints in chalk.

     Notice of the Jaws of an Ichthyosaurus from the Chalk in the neighbourhood

                                of Cambridge. By Mr./CARTER.

7 The author supposed these remains would constitute a new species, the teeth
      differing in a very remarkable manner from those of any Ichthyosaurus which he had
      been able to examine, or of which he could find published descriptions. The dental
      groove of the lower jaw is placed in a different plane from that of the upper, and
      the apposition of the upper and lower ranges of teeth is effected by the roots of the
       lower teeth developing themselves in a curved direction. Considering it probable
      that this peculiarity is characteristic of the species, he proposes to give it the name
      campylodon, from the Greek word kampulos, ' bowed or bent.'
          Mr. Carter has also discovered teeth and vertebrae of the same species in the
       upper greensand near Cambridge.

     On Posidonian Schist amidst Trajypcean Beds, and on Traces of Drift-ice in
        the South of the Isle of Man. By the Rev. J. G. Gumming, M.A., of
         Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and Vice-Principal of King William's Col-
         lege, Isle of Man.

         The steps of St. Paul's cathedral, presented by the venerable Bishop Thomas
      Wilson, are the produce of certain quarries at Poolvash in the Isle of Man.

         The bed from which they were taken is an impure schistose black limestone, cha-
       racterized by very fine and perfect Posidonice. It is remarkably interposed between
       beds of regularly stratified trap-luff, and though the order of superposition shows it

       to be of later date than the light-coloured limestone of Poolvash ; in mineralogical
       and palaeontological character it presents a return to the lowest limestone of this

         basin.

         The first object of this paper is to trace out the condition of this area at the period
       of this deposit; and the second, to notice some of the more remarkable changes which

       have since passed over it.
          The elevation at different periods of the schists and other older rocks which con-

       stitute the mountain chain of the island, running irregularly nearly north-north-east

      and south-south-west from the Calf of Man to Maughold Head, has formed on the

        south-western side around Castletown a semi-elliptical basin, the extremity of the
       major axis being Coshnahawin in the north-east, and Perwick Bay near Port le
       Murray in the south-west. These schists seem to be lower Silurian, but, containing
        only a few fucoids (as far as seen hitherto), their exact age is uncertain.

          Resting unconformably upon them, we have the old red conglomerate, which is
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  61

never developed to a thickness greater than fifty feet in the south of the island. This
conglomerate seems to pass regularly into the superior dark limestone by a gradual
abstraction of the larger quartz pebbles and the substitution of a brownish carbona-

ceous paste in place of the previous ochreous and gritty matrix. The characteristic

fossils of these lower dark limestones are Ortkis Sharpei,LeplcenapapUionacea,Phillip-
sia Kellii, a Ci-eseis and Posidonia, with abundance of the larger corals and Productce.

   Some sudden change, however, appears after a time to have taken place in the

physical condition of the basin, probably by an elevation of the sea-bottom, for the
dark limestones are at once replaced by a series of light-coloured beds without shale,
and abundantly charged with fossils which coincide with those of the lower scar
limestone of Yorkshire, the dark limestone fossils resembling those of the lowest

Northumbrian shales and of Hook Point in the south of Ireland. These light-
coloured limestones attain a thickness of rather more than fifty feet. There is evi-

dence again of another very sudden change having taken place in this area owing to
a disturbance, accompanied with an outpouring of trap, along a line from the Stack
of Scarlet to the hill above Balladoole ; and subsequently, for some time, deposits
of volcanic ash were constantly being accumulated in this area, and along with them
the regular carboniferous deposits of this period were developed. This formed a

trappaean limestone; and when at one particular period a quiescence of the volcanic
eruptions took place, the bed of Posidonia schist which forms the marble quarry at

Poolvash was deposited.
    Another eruption broke up this bed, carrying along with it fragments which are

mingled with the trap, so as to form a breccia j and subsequently the whole mass
appears to have been subjected to considerable heat, and has suffered disturbance,
being traversed by trap-dykes which intersect the area in directions generally north-

west and south-east.
   The author then noticed some remarkable bosses on the surface of this area, both

in Poolvash Bay and elsewhere. The origin of them he attributed to the intrusion
of trap amidst the old red conglomerate betwixt the schists and the tough lime-

stones.

   He then observed that the greater part of this southern basin of the Isle of Man

was covered up by masses of boulder-clay and by an accumulation of diluvium ; and
he proceeded to some notice of the direction in which the materials appear to have

been moved into the locality where they now are. He directed attention to two

slabs obtained from Poolvash Bay and Scarlet strongly marked with parallel groovings
and scratches, in directions east-north-east and west-south-west, and he accounted

for them by observing that at the period of this formation the present Isle of Man

was divided into three islands, and that most probably, through the channels between

them, currents would run, as at the present time, between the Calf of Man and the

main island. Icebergs drifting along through the southern channel, and carrying
with them hard pebbles and blocks of the harder limestones, in passing over their
basset edge, which lies to the north-east of Castletown Bay, would score and polish
every more eminent flat surface exposed in the channel as those at Poolvash and
Scarlet. The shales would form abundantly the clay of the period. By a compari-
son of the contained rocks, he showed that the drift-current came from the east-
north-east and not from the west-south-west. The overspreading diluvium appears
to have come in quite a different direction, viz. from the north-west, bringing down
rolled blocks of granite of South Barrule. It contains also, amongst other travelled
rocks, chalk-flints, which must be referred for their origin to the north of Ireland.

                      ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.

On the Scientific Principles on which Classification in the higher Departments
           of Zoology should be based. By William Ogilby, F.L.S.

The dental system was no doubt a valuable means of diagnosis, and this depended
upon the fact that it had a relation to the stomach, and other viscera intended for the
digestion of food. Just in the same way, the extremities of the mammalia, more par-

ticularlj' the fore-arm, are the exponents of the habits, mental power, and oeconomy
of animals. The fore-arm is the seat of the function of locomotion, of manipulation
and touch. According to the real position of an animal in the scale of organization
will be the character of its fore-arm. This position was illustrated by examples from

the various families of mammalia. He thought that in our usual systems of zoology

a too exclusive regard had been given to the structure and form of the teeth.

       On the Fossil Elephantine Animals of India. By Dr. Falconer.

    In this communication, which was illustrated by diagrams of the crania, the author
gave the results of the investigations by Captain Cautley and himself regarding the
fossil Mastodons and Elephants of India, and endeavoured, by a series of teeth sec-
tions, to show that there was a gradual and continuous passage in the structure of the
teeth between the Mastodon and the Elephant, the forms which have been included
under the name of Mastodon Elephantoides by Clift, and an undescribed Indian spe-
cies, constituting the intermediate links.

    On the Unity of Organisation as exhibited in the Skeleton of Animals,
                                   By Dr. Macdonald.

    All animals, even the simplest, are possessed of a central as well as peripheral or-
ganism, varying in density as we ascend the scale, and are capable of increase by a
repetition of segments having the primary elementary characters. As the form be-
comes lengthened, the central portion also elongates till we have a long axis or central
stem. This Caulis centralis in the vertebralia is the axis formed by the bodies of the
vertebrae, which is too often improperly called the backbone. In the vertebralia the
Caulis centralis has developed on its posterior or neural aspect a lamina on each side

of the mesian lines, and those in the adult forms of the higher mammals are com-
pletely ossified together in the spinous process, and also to the bodies of the vertebrae.

   The author proposes to distinguish three parts or divisions in each lamina, most
easily traced in the membranal laminae.

  --I. Protomeral. Single (simplex), orbicular, or when elongated, the shaft having
--convex or round extremities. Brachium. Femur.

    II. Deutomcral. Generally double (duplex) ; the shaft having concave extremities,

--and its proximal extremity more or less elongated into an olecranon.
    III. Trilomeral. Manifold (multiplex), terminal, orbicular; as in the carpus and
tarsus and digital termination.

    Mons. Selys de Longchamps explained in French, at some length, the object which
the Academy of Brussels had had in view in obtaining accurate dates for the appear-
ance, pairing, building, &c. of birds, the migration of fishes, the budding, flowering,
&c. of plants. By connecting these with meteorological phaenomena, we might arrive
at an expression of the cause of the pha2nomena observed.

some writers on Egyptian matters, was in the year 2100 b.c, which on good authority

is the 240th year of the Deluge, this gigantic stork was an inhabitant of the delta or
its immediate vicinity ; for, as these very interesting documents relate, it was occa-
sionally entrapped by the peasantry of the delta, and brought with other wild animals

--as matters of curiosity to the great landholders or farmers of the products of the Nile,
    of which circumstance this painted sculpture is a representation, the catching of fish
and birds, which in these days occupied a large portion of the inhabitants. The birds
and fish were salted. That this document gives no exaggerated account of the bird

may be presumed from the just proportion that the quadrupeds, in the same picture,
bear to the men who are leading them ; and, from the absence of any representation
of these birds in the less ancient monuments of Egypt, it may also be reasonably con-
jectm'ed they disappeared soon after the period of the erection of these tombs. With

respect to the relation these facts bear to each other, I beg to remark that the colossal
nests of Captains Cook and Flinders, and also those of Mr. James Burton, were all on
the sea-shore, and all of those about an equal distance from the equator. But whe-
ther the Egyptian birds, as described in those very ancient sculptures, bear any analogy
to those recorded in the last pages of the great stone-book of nature (the new red
sandstone formation), or whether they bear analogy to any of the species determined

by Professor Owen from the New Zealand fossils, 1 am not qualified to say, nor is it

indeed the object of this paper to discuss, the intention of which is rather to bring
together these facts, and to associate them with that recorded at Gezah, in order to

call the attention of those who have opportunity of making further research into this

interesting matter.

On the Discovery of Guano in the Faroe Islands,
       By W. C. Trevelyan, M.A., F.G.S.

This guano occurs principally on the shelves, commonly from eight to twenty feet

wide, which are formed by the disintegration of the softer beds in the lofty precipices,

often rising to the height of more than 1000, and in one instance above 2000 feet.

Of such places, sheltered by the projecting rocks above, the sea-fowl take advantage,
and considerable deposits of guano are found there, often the collection of many years.

In some instances, when it accumulated so much as, from its slope towards the

sea, to make an insecure resting-place for the eggs, the Faroese, who did not know its

value, but to whom the birds, both on account of their feathers and for food, were of

great importance, shovelled it off into the sea. Now, however, they have learnt at

--least its commercial worth, and collect it carefully, in many places at considerable

risk, the collectors being let down by ropes to the ledges, whence they lower the guano

Ainto boats below.  few tons of it have been e.xported to Lynn, Norfolk.

            Remarks on Entomology. By J. O. Westwood, F.L.S.

   After shortly noticing the general ceconomy of the hive-bee as to the production of
queens and the swarming of casts, he contended, from the analogy between the cir-

--cumstances connected with the latter event and those which accompany the swarming

of ants, gnats, white ants, may-flies, &c., 1st, that the swarming of insects has for its
principal object the union of the sexes ; 2nd, that, from analogy with other insects
subject to swarming, it might be inferred that the hive bee does not difter in this re-
spect from other swarming species ; and hence 3rdly, that it is the newly-hatched, and
not the old queen, which leads ofi'the swarm.

   Mr. Ball noticed the fact of one of the Notonectidae, ( Corixa striata, Curtis,) emitting
loud and powerful sounds somewhat like those of a cricket. These sounds were given
out while the animal was about two inches and a half under water, and so loud as to be
distinctly audible in an adjoining room through the closed door. The first observation
of this fact was made about two years since by Miss M. Ball, who has since frequently
verified the original observation. Mr. Ball stated that he had himself heard on the

by the male : it has as yet only been heard in the months of May and June.

                  On a New Genus q/*Mollusca Nudibranchiata.
                         By Messrs. Alder and Hancock.

   This new genus is founded on the Tritonia arhorsscens of authors and its allies,
which are distinguished from the true Tritonise (T. Hombergii, &c.) by the form of
their tentacula, and the free, arborescent nature of their branchiae. These characters
alone induced tlie authors to consider them generically distinct, before they had an
opportunity of examining their internal structure, in which such important differences
in the digestive organs were exhibited as to show that this new genus, for wiiich the
name of Dendronotus is proposed, should be removed from the family Tritoniada to
that oi EoUdidcE, to be placed first in order, as the connecting link between these two

families.

   The paper was illustrated by drawings from the work by Messrs. Alder and Han-
cock on the British Nudibranchiate Mollusca, just published by the Ray Society.

Mr. W. Thompson read a letter from Mr. Alder, dated Salcombe, June 17, 1845,

in which the writer stated that he had lately obtained in Torbay at least ten, and

perhaps twelve new species of Mollusca ?iudibrunchiata, to add to the British Fauna.

They consist of four species o^ Doris, five or six oi Eolts, and an animal of an entirely

Anew genus, approaching nearest to Tritonia.      singular species of mollusk obtained

at the same time, resembling in general appearance the genus Pelta of Quatrefages,

was noticed in detail.

  A letter was read by the Secretary from Captain Portlock, replying to the remarks

made at York by Professor E. Forbes on the results of his dredging at Corfu. Tlie
account then read he had not wished to be considered a complete report, but as an

indication of progress. In conclusion, Captain Portlock stated, that " in dredging, a
conclusion from a very limited range of research is as dangerous as similar conclusions
have been in geological inquiries. For example, a hasty deduction from the appear-

ance of an animal at a particular depth of water is evidently imperfect, as the nature
of the bottom and the description of the marine vegetation are more likely to modify

such appearances. I see, for example, that Professor Bell quotes the discovery of
Eurynome aspera by Professor Forbes in the deep water of the Egean as a proof that
the species is essentially a deep-water one, both in the Mediterranean and the Northern
Seas. Here, however, I have found it just at the verge of the rocks where sea-weeds
prevail, and therefore in comparatively shallow waters, i. e. from ten to sixteen fathoms.

Other northern species, such as Ebalia Pennantii, Achceus Crouchii (if I am right in
my identification of them), I have found under similar circumstances ; and I am,

therefore, the more inclined to ascribe their existence to the local peculiarities of vege-

tation than to the depth."

On the Marine Fauna of Cornwall. By Charles William Peach.

that, notwithstanding it had been considered as solitary, he had found it in bunches

He then presented specimens of the Cineras vittata of Leach, which he took from the

bottom of a vessel, timber laden, discharging at Plymouth from Africa, and then com-

mented on the fact, that though this shell was a native of a warm climate, and was

years, it lived and tln-ove well ; and he was desirous of recording the fact of the time

of its introduction, if at any time it should become general on our shores. He ex-
hibited also what he considered a new Alcyonmm, and proceeded to notice the immense

myriads of Acalephida and purse-like forms which had been so abundant on the coast

of Cornwall as to discolour the sea for miles. He spoke of the extreme sensibility
of these animals, their luminosity and habits. There was also a notice of a new
sponge from Cornwall. The paper was illustrated by specimens and drawings.

Notice of Additions to the Marine Fauna of Britain, discovered by Robert

 --The animals described in this communication are, 1st, a new species ofChemnitzia,

C rufescens, taken off Arran in from thirty to forty fathoms, and at Oban on sand in

fifteen fathoms water. It has nine convex whorls, ribbed longitudinally and striated
spirally; brown, with darker bands, and white at the base. It measures -j^ths of an
inch in length. 2nd. The beautiful and curious Pectoi pes-felis, hitherto known as
an inhabitant of the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Mr. M'Andrew took a small but

well-marked living specimen in thirty fathoms in Loch Fine. 3rd. The beautiful

coral named Turbinolia milletiana, hitherto known only as a fossil of the English and

AFrench miocene tertiaries.  living specimen was taken on sand in thirty fathoms

on the coast of the Scilly Isles, and a dead one in forty-five fathoms off the Land's

End. The beautiful zoophyte Funicularia (jtiadrajigularis, first announced as British

at York last year, has been again taken in the Hebrides, and well-preserved specimens

above three feet in length were exhibited at the Section.

  A small Rissoa, apparently new, was also laid before the meeting, and is remark-

able for having been taken in water as deep as 100 fathoms on the west coast of

Scotland.

                   On the Cilia and Ciliary Currents of the Oyster.
                       By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.

   The author stated, that in a microscopic investigation of Infusoria, which had for
some years occupied his attention, he had been led particularly to notice the beautiful
contrivance by which many species, when not exerting their powers of locomotion,

are supplied with food. When they are examined under the microscope by such an

arrangement of transmitted light as makes the Infusoria luminous points on a per-
fectly dark field, it is immediately seen that the action of the cilia attached to their
tentacula produces a strong current in the water, and hereby a countless number of
minute living organisms is brought within the influence of the cilia, and a sufficient
supply is selected for food. Thus, with respect to Infusoria, it is a known fact, that
the absence of the prehensile organs possessed by larger creatures is compensated by
this delicate but efficient ciliary apparatus. It is also a fact equally well known, that
the lips of the oyster, which surround the orifice of the alimentary canal, are, in the
same manner, fringed with cilia ; and that these cilia of the oyster, as of Infusoria,
equally cause currents in the water. But it has never been suggested and proved by
any naturalist that the proper office of the cilia of oysters is to bring to these acepha-
lous mollusks that food which they have no power to follow or to seize. Such, how-
ever, without doubt, is the case ; and, accordingly, an examination of the contents of
the stomachs of oysters discovers to us their infusorial food ; and, after undergoing the
process of digestion in the stomach, the siliceous shields of these Infusoria, deprived
of their organic and carbonaceous integuments, are ejected as effete matter. In a
paper communicated last year to the Microscopical Society of London, on animals of
the chalk still found in a living state in the stomachs of oysters, these Infusoria were
described and enumerated. The apparent identity existing between these recent
living Infusoria and the fossil, makes the inquiry of considerable interest to the geolo-
gist; for the addition of this coimecting link to the chain of organized beings extends
a continuous line of the same organic structure from the secondary formation to the
tertiary, and seems to preclude the supposition, that below the tertiary formation are
no recent species. Whether or not this conclusion be admitted, it is a fact, ascer-
tained by pursuing this inquiry, that the oysters and other bivalve.«, which are innu-

merable in the Kimmeridge clay, lived, like recent oysters, upon Infusoria ; and
consequently the conclusion is unavoidable, that the Kimmeridge clay, like the chalk,
contains a considerable per-centage of these minute and indestructible bodies which
the microscope discovers in it, and is not the mere comminuted detritus of more
ancient and unorganized materials. With these facts established, we may still further
conclude, from analogy, that a similar ciliary apparatus, and similar infusorial food
were common to the still earlier bivalves in the seas of the transition formation ; and
we may then ask. What right have we, in the absence of a careful microscopic exami-
nation of still eavher rocks, to deny the possibility of any portion of their mass being
due to the agency of siliceous Infusoria ?

On the Distribution of Endemic Plants, more especially those of the British
  Islands, considered rvith regard to Geological Changes. By Professor E.

   Forbes.

The hypothesis of the descent of all the individuals of a species either from a first

pair or from a first individual, and the consequent theory of specific centres being

assumed, the isolation of assemblages of individuals from those centres, and the ex-

istence of endemic or very local plants, remain to be accounted for. Natural trans-

port, the agency of the sea, rivers and winds, and carriage by animals, or through

the agency of man, are means, in the majority of cases, insufficient. It is usual to

say, that the presence of many plants is determined by soil or climate, as the case
may be ; but if such plants be found in areas disconnected from their centres by con-

siderable intervals, some other cause than the mere influence of soil or climate must

be sought to account for their presence. This cause the author proposes to seek in

an ancient connexion of the outposts or isolated areas with the original centres, and

the subsequent isolation of the former through geological changes and events, espe-

cially those dependent on the elevation and depression of land. Selecting the flora

of the British Isles for a first illustration of this view, Professor Forbes calls atten-

tion to the fact, well-known to botanists, of certain species of flowering plants being

found indigenous in portions of that area at a great distance from the nearest assem-

blage of individuals of the same species in countries beyond it. Thus many plants

peculiar in the British flora to the west of Ireland have the nearest portion of their

specific centres in the north-west of Spain ; others, confined with us to the south-west

promontory of England, are, beyond our shores, found in the Channel Isles and the

opposite coast of France ; the vegetation of the south-east of England is that of the

opposite part of the continent ; and the alpine vegetation of Wales and the Scottish
highlands is intimately related to that of the Norwegian Alps. The great mass of the

British flora has its most intimate relations with that of western Germany. The vege-

--tation of the British Islands may be said to be composed of five floras: 1st, a west

Pyrenean, confined to the west of Ireland, and mostly to the mountains of that district;

2nd, a flora related to that of the south-west of France, extending from the Channel

Isles, acrossDevon and Cornwall, to the south-east and partofthesouth-westof Ireland;

3rd, a flora common to the north of France and south-east of England, and especially

developed in the chalk districts; 4th, an Alpine flora, developed in the mountains of

Wales, north of England and Scotland ; and 5th, a Germanic flora, extending over,

the greater part of Great Britain and Ireland, mingling with the other floras, and

diminishing, though slightly, as we proceed westwards, indicating its easterly origin and

relation to the characteristic flora of northern and western Germany. Interspersed

among the members of the last-named flora, are a very few specific centres peculiar to

the British Isles. The author numbers these floras according to magnitude as to

species, and also, in his opinion, according to their relative age and periods of intro-

duction into the area of the British Islands. His conclusions on this point are the

following :

   1. The oldest of the floras now composing the vegetation of the British Isles is that
of the mountains of the west of Ireland. Though an alpine flora, it is southernmost

in character, and quite distinct as a system from the floras of the Scottish and Welsh

alps. Its very southern character, its limitation, and its extreme isolation are evi-
dences of its antiquity, pointing to a period when a great mountain banier extended

across the mouth of the Bay of Biscay from Spain to Ireland.

--S8 REPORT 1845.

   2. The distribution of the second flora, next in point of probable date, depended
on the extension of a barrier, the traces of which still remain, from the west of France
to the south-west of Britain, and thence to Ireland.

    3. The distribution of the third flora depended on the connexion of the coasts of
France and England towards the eastern part of the Channel. Of the former exist-

ence of this union no geofogist doubts.
    4. The distribution of the fourth, or alpine flora of Scotland and Wales, was ef-

fected during the glacial period, when the mountain summits of Britain were low
islands, or members of chains of islands, extending to the area of Norway through a
 glacial sea, and clothed with an arctic vegetation, which, in the gradual upheaval of
 the land and consequent change of climate, became limited to the summits of the

 new-formed and still existing mountains.
    5. The distribution of the fifth, or Germanic flora, depended on the upheaval of

 the bed of the glacial sea, and the consequent connexion of Ireland with England,
 and of England with Germany, by great plains, the fragments of which still exist,
 and upon which lived the great elk and other quadrupeds now extinct.

    The breaking up or submergence of the first barrier led to the destruction of the
 second ; that of the second to that of the third ; but the well-marked epoch of the
 Germanic flora indicates the subsequent formation of the Straits of Dover and of the

 Irish Sea, as now existing.

  --To determine the probable geological epoch of the first or west-Irish flora, a frag-

 ment perhaps with that of north-western Spain, of the vegetation of the true Atlantic,

 --we must seek among fossil plants for a starting-point in time. This we get in the

 flora of the London clay or eocene, which is tropical in character, and far anterior to
 the oldest of the existing floras. The geographical relations of the miocene sea, indi-
 cated by the fossils of the coralline crag, give an afterdate certainly to the second and
 third of the above floras, if not to the first. The epoch of the red or middle crag was
 probably coeval with the incoming of the second flora ; that of the mammaliferous
 crag with the third. The date of the fourth is too evident to he questioned ; and the
  author regards the glacial region in which it flourished as a local climate, of which no
  true traces, so far as animal life is concerned, exist southwards of the second and third
 barriers. This was the newer pliocene epoch. The period of the fifth flora was that
  of the post-tertiary, when the present aspect of things was organized.

      Adopting such a view of the relations of these floras in time, the greatest difficul-

 --ties in the way of changes of the earth's surface and destruction of barriers deep sea
 --being now found where land (probably high land) was are removed when we find that

  those greater changes must have happened during the epoch immediately subsequent
  to the miocene period; for we have undoubted evidence that elsewhere, during that
  epoch, the miocene sea- bed was raised 6000 feet in the chain of the Taurus, and the
  barriers forming the westward boundary of the Asiatic eocene lakes so completely
  annihilated, that a sea several hundred fathoms deep now replaces them. The

  chanties required for the events which the author would connect with the peculiar

  distribution of the British flora need not have been greater than these.
      Prof. Forbes maintains that the peculiar distribution of endemic animals, especially

  of the terrestrial moUusca, bears him out in these views. He proposes to pursue the

  subject in detail, with reference both to animal and vegetable life, in connexion with

   the researches of the geological survey.

On the Development of Vegetable Cells. By A. Henfrey, F.L.S.

MM.After noticing the opinions of  Mirbel, Schleiden, Mohl and NiigeH, he stated
--the conclusions to which he had been conducted by observations, viz. 1. That there

is no such thing as the interruption of continuity between the liber and albm-num,

called the cambium layer. 2. That the potentiality of the black granules described

by Schleiden is not proved, and that the utricle first developed from the so-called

cytoblast is not the permanent cell, but the primordial utricle of Mohl, the existence

of which in growing tissues seems to be universal. 3. That this primordial utricle is

not a layer of mucilage, as stated by Nageli, but a true membrane. The author re-

gards the nucleolus, or central spot of Schleiden's cytoblast, as the germinal point, and

as situated on the wall of the primordial utricle. When a new cell is to be formed
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  6^

the nucleolus divides into two, and a corresponding construction of the primordial
utricle takes place until it separates into two, a layer of permanent cell-wall substance
being, meanwhile, secreted in this fold frona the circumference to the centre, till a
complete septum is formed. The lateral walls grow by extension, being moulded on
the growing primordial utricle within them. In the nascent cell, the primordial utricle
is filled with granular matter, which, during the subsequent growth of the cell, re-

     On the Influence of Galvanic Electricity on the Germination of Seeds.
                            By Professor E. Solly, F.R.S.

   He commenced by describing the old experiments of Sir H. Davy, in which seeds

placed in the vicinity of the positive pole of a voltaic pile, germinated sooner than
those near the negative pole, an effect which might be attributed to the oxygen evolved
at the positive pole, which of course would accelerate germination, whilst the hydrogen
set free at the negative extremity would retard it. These experiments did not in any

way prove that germination was stimulated hy electricity; but judging from the known
powers of electricity, it would be reasonable to expect that like light and heat, it would
exert marked influence on the growth of vegetables, in fact, act as a stimulus.

    In a series of experiments, in which the seeds of barley, wheat, rye, turnips and
radish were exposed to the influence of a feeble current of electricity, the plants came

up sooner and were healthier than others that had not been electrified. On the other

hand, a number of experiments on other seeds had given opposite results, proving
either that the germination of some seeds was retai-ded whilst that of others was
facilitated by electricity, or that the eSects observed in both cases were accidental.
Out of a series of fifty-five experiments on different seeds, twenty appeared in
favour of electricity, ten against it, and twenty-five showed no effect whatever; and
in carefully counting the whole number of seeds up in the entire series, there were
found 1250 of the electrified, and 1253 of the non-electrified. In conclusion, Prof.
Solly stated that he felt doubtful whether the effects observed were really due to the

influence of electricity.

    On the Germination of Plants. By Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

 --The phffinomena that take place during what is called germination, are, 1, ab-

sorption of oxygen from the atmosphere ; 2, a disengagement of carbonic acid ; 3,
a disengagement of ammonia; 4, conversion of starch into dextrine, gum, sugar, &c.;

--5, increase in bulk growth of the embryo. The most commonly adopted theory of

germination explained the above phaenomena, as being necessarily connected with the
last fact mentioned in the above series, the growth of the embryo. It was in fact sup-
posed that the absorption of oxj'gen and the disengagement of carbonic acid gas was
an act of life, a necessary process of the act of germination, and germination and
vegetation were regarded as antagonising processes, the one being an oxidating, the
other a deoxidating process, whilst the albumen was regarded as a sole source of
nourishment ; the author proposed to regard the phasnomena of germination differ-

ently. It is obvious that the only essential process of germination is the growth of
the young plant or embryo. The process of development of the embryo from primi-
tive cytoblasts developing its tissues, is precisely the same as that of every other part
of the plant, and from an identity of structure, an identity of function might be in-
ferred. But the ordinary theory of germination gave a different function to the

tissues of the embryo. The author considered this unnecessary. He believed that
the absorption of oxygen, the disengagement of carbonic acid gas and ammonia arose

entirely from the decomposition of the starch and protein contained in the albumen or
perisperm of the seed, and that the growing cells of the embryo appropriated the
carbonic acid and ammonia with water, just in the same way as all other cells in the
vegetable kingdom. This theory he conceived was not only more consistent with the
phasnomena of germination observed in plants containing large quantities of starch
in their perisperm, but also consistent with a large class of facts which were opposed

--to the ordinary view, of which the following were brought forward : 1. In many

plants no perisperm was developed, and the conditions required for germination were
                      --                                                                ;

precisely those for vegetation. 2. Many plants with hard perisperms, as the Phyte-

lephas macrocarpa, the Phoenix dactylifera, and species of Bactris, Cocos and Astro-

caryum, germinate without consuming any appreciable quantity of the perisperm.
3. The quantity of carbonic acid obtained by Saussure varied not according to the
number, but according to the mass of the seeds, proving that it arose from the decom-
position of the starch as a chemical process, and not from the growth of the embryo

as a process of life. 4. De Saussure found that the relation between the oxygen con-
sumed and the carbonic acid gas given out, was different in diiferent plants for the
same quantity of the latter, which ought to be constant if the theory of oxidation or

combustion during germination be true. 5. Boussingault found that the changes
supposed to be peculiar to germination went on in the perisperm after the young
plant had developed its radicle and plumule, and was capable of an independent exist-
ence. 6. The changes which take place in the chemical composition of the perisperm
of the seed during germination can be artificially produced by mixing starch, diastase,
&c. together and exposing them to the action of the atmosphere. This theory modi-
fies the view of the use of the albumen or perisperm. It is not deposited essentially
for the nourishment of the young plant. In some cases it is an organ of support, and
bears the same relation to the embryo as the wood of a branch to the buds upon it.
Viewing it morphologically, it might be considered the analogue of the tegmenta of
the buds ; as they consisted of aborted leaves, so the albumen or perisperm consisted

of embryos aborted in their earliest stages of development.

On the Phytelephas Macrocarpa {Vegetable Ivortj or Tagua Plant).
                    By E. Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.

The author brought this plant under the notice of the Section, as he was enabled

to present a drawing of a young plant, which was now growing in the garden of

AMessrs. Loddiges of Hackney.   fruit also of this plant existed in the British Mu-

seum, of which a drawing was exhibited. This plant had been placed in the natural

order Typhince by Bonpland and Humboldt; with Pandanece by Brown; with Cy-

clanthacecB by Lindley. The fruit is of the size of a man's head, and the tree is called

Aby the Spaniards Negro-head.   remarkable point in the ceconomy of this plant

was, that the horny albumen of the seed appeared to undergo no change during
the process of germination. In the plant at Loddiges', which was now five years old,

the seed still remained on the surface of the soil, apparently as hard as ever. In

germination, the young embryo was carried down by a rhizoma an inch or more long

into the earth, and commenced growing at that point.

The perisperms of other palms, as the species of Bactris, of Cocos, and of the

Phostiix dactylifera, also undergo but little change during germination. The peri-

sperm of a species of Astrocaryum in British Guiana is stated by Sir Robert Schom-

burgk to be as hard as that of Phytelephas. The structure of the tissue of th.e seed

is remarkable. The walls of the cells are very thick, and in their early stages porous

the pores between the cells are at last closed, and the pores form club-shaped cavities

leading out of the cells. Cooper, in his illustration of the microscopic structure of

these cells, has drawn a line running between these club-shaped cavities, but this arises

from a tube lying underneath, and has no connection with the termination of the

pores. The cells by the resorption of their walls become converted into tubes. The

tubes under the microscope appear to contain globules of oil. Chemical analyses of

the seeds had been made by Payen, Connell and Baumhauer. A more accurate ana-

lysis was made, at the author's request, by Dr. Percy of Birmingham. The result of

this analysis was as follows :

Carbon                                                44-39

Hydrogen , 6*63

Oxygen                                                47-61

   In drjring 12-64 per cent, of water was dissipated. The ash contained sulphuric,
hydrochloric, phosphoric and carbonic acids in combination with potassa, lime and
oxide of iron. The phosphoric acid was partly combined with the potassa. The iron
was probably introduced in filing the perisperm for chemical examination.

                    Description of the Murichi, or Ita Palm, of Guiana.

                                 By Sir R. Schomburgk.

    The author referred to the early accounts which naturah"sts in Europe received of
 this beautiful palm, of which Sir Walter Raleigh appears to have brought the first

 fruits to Europe. Clusius, in his ' Exotic Flora,' describes it as " fructus elegantissi-

 mus squamosus similis palmse-pini, " and Father Gumilla, Gili, and the older au-
 thors on Guiana extol it in consequence of the various uses the aborigines of Guiana
make of it. It serves at different stages of its growth as a vegetable and furnishes a

 cabbage equal to the Palmetto ; at the maturity of its fruits, they are eaten as well in
 their natural state as prepared into a drink, which, when drunk copiously, proves ine-

briating. It is remarkable, that when much use is made of the fruit it communicates
to the linen a yellow colour after perspiration. The trunk is tapped and a fluid flows
from it which possesses much saccharine matter. Of the greatest delicacy however
is the saccharine liquor extracted from the unexpanded flower, which aflx)rds a liquor
resembling champagne in its briskness. The Indians prepare from the pith of its
 trunk a flour resembling that of the Sagas farinifera, which the Warrau Indians call
Aril*. Mixed as a pap, it is considered to be an excellent remedy for dysentery.
The fan-shaped leaves are used as a thatch for covering houses, and the stump of
one of those leaves serves as a broom to sweep them with. The Indians of the Savan-
nahs and mountainous tracts use the base of the half-sheathing leaves for the pre-
paration of sandals. The midribs of the young branches are cut in thin slices, and
after having been dried they are connected together with withes, and serve as a sail
for the Indian's canoe or as a mat to sleep upon. They are used by the travelling
entomologist as a substitute for cork to fix insects upon, or to those who are provided
with strong beards as razor-strops. Of the greatest use are however the fibres of the
young leaves, which are manufactured into thread and ropes, and they are of such a
tenacity that the greater number of Indian tribes fabricate their beds and hammocks
of them. The inhabitants of the Rio Negro make a trade of it, and a fine hammock is
sold from ten to twelve milreis. Even in its decay the mauritia is of use, and affords a
delicacy to the Indians, which likewise many colonists do not refuse, namely, the
Jarvee of a large beetle ; the CurcuUo palmarum is found in large numbers in the pith
when the trunk is near its decay, and, when boiled or roasted, resembles in taste

beef-marrow.

   This useful tree, which extends from the Llanos of Cumana to the western tributa-
ries of the Rio Negro and the mouth of the Amazon, or over an area of 550,000 square
miles, was appropriately called by Father Gumilla arhol de la vida, the tree of life
and it is related at the Orinoco, that one of the kings of Spain hearing of this won-
drous tree, which at once furnished bed, bread and wine, attempted its introduction
into the mother country. The author wished to correct finally those who have writ-
ten on this tree in two points. It is, first, described as a tree scarcely thirty feet
high, while it reaches sometimes a height of 120 feet, and its average size in Guiana
is not less than fifty f^et ; and next to this it is asserted, that the}' are not to be found
at a greater height than 800 feet, while the author has met them in numerous groups
and of a luxuriant growth at a height of from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea, growing
as usual in groups and in swampy soil.

 Description of the Fruit of some of the Hepaticce, By Professor Allman.

    In this communication the author demonstrated the existence in the sporangia of
Marchantia and Jungermannia of precisely the same form of fibro-cellular tissue which
is found in the lining membi-ane of the anthers of flowering plants. This structure
he believed to constitute a beautiful hygroscopic apparatus, through whose agency the

dehiscence of the fruit is effected.
    Prof. Allman observed, that in Marchantia conica, at the period of maturation, the

pedicel of the sporangium becomes suddenly increased in size, being all at once
gorged with juices, and by acting against the top of the receptacle, forces the sporan-
gium through the margin of this latter structure, and thus brings the peculiar tissue
of which it is composed into a condition which enables it to be acted on by the hy-

nation arrow-root is most likely derived from the Indian word.

groscopic powers of the atmosphere, when dehiscence immediately takes place and
allows of the escape of the spores and elaters. The origin of the elaters Dr. Allman
·was inclined to refer to a metamorphosis of certain cells of the same nature as those
which constituted the walls of the sporangium.

                   On a Monstrosity occurring in Saxifraga Geum.
                           By Professor Allman, M.R.I. A.

    This monstrosity was discovered by William Andrews, Esq., on the mountains of
 Kerry, about three years ago. Mr. Andrews has cultivated it in his garden, and finds
its characters remarkably persistent, remaining from year to year in the same plant,
 and being even capable of perpetuation by seed.

    The three external verticels are normal, but between the stamens and pistil there
 is developed a series of adventitious carpels crowded upon the margin of a cup-like
 production which surrounds the lower half of the pistil.

     These adventitious carpels are characterized by the anomalous fact of having their
 backs turned towards the axis of the flower. They bear numerous ovules, which, as
 the margins of the carpels never unite, are always exposed, and present the appear-
 ance of a gland-like ring surrounding the pistil. The ovules belonging to the adven-
 titious carpels acquire a very considerable degree of development, becoming com-
 pletely anatropous like those contained within the normal ovary, and a distinct primine,
 secundine and nucleus, with a well-marked vascular raphe, can plainly be seen.

     Dr. Allman explained the singular character of this monstrosity by supposing the
 existence of a series of pecondary axes which are given off in a whorl between the
 stamens and the primary axis of the flower. These secondary axes terminate each in
 its flower, which however is reduced nearly to the lowest possible condition of deve-
 lopment, the three outer whorls being absent, and all those pistillary carpels which
  would, if present, have their faces turned to the primary axis, being also in a state of
 complete abortion. The secondary axes then adhere with each other and with the
 normal pistil, so as to form the cup just described, and the existing carpels of the
  secondary axes necessary have their backs turned to the normal pistil, being refer-
  able to these axes and not to the primary axis of the flower.

     Professor Henslow exhibited a specimen of Papaver orientale, in which the fila-
  ments of the stamens were converted into bodies bearing ovules.

          On Practical Means for the Advancement of Systematic Botany.
                                     By J. Ball, M.R.I.A.

     In the present state of systematic botany we require more accurate and extensive
  observations and experiments with respect to the variations of the forms of plants than
  have yet been made, and that the forms of descriptive botany should be modified so
  as to exhibit the whole of the forms contained in the larger groups and their mutual
  relations in a more philosophical manner.

      The great impediment to the progress of natural history has been the want of union
  between observers and thinkers, those who study the details of the science and those
  who speculate on its general aspects and theory; in order to facilitate and forward
   their imion, it seems desirable that botanists of both classes should agree upon a well-
   considered series of observations and experiments which should be conducted in a
   public botanic garden, where the requisite precautions as to securing the accurate ob-
   servance of the conditions agreed upon, the preservation of specimens, and the keep-
   ing a proper register, might be adopted and enforced; and, finally, where the expe-
   riments would not be exposed to the interruptions and other accidents which threaten

   individual observers.
       If, for instance, two groups of plants were selected, in one of which the individual

   forms approximate very nearly to each other, and in the other the species appear well-
   characterised by constant characters, and a number of individuals of each of a series
   of forms were exposed to the action of all the causes which we know to be capable of
   modifying the development of vegetable form, the best means being taken for isolating
                 TRANSAGTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            73

the action of each of these causes, so that it may be compared with that of the ordi-

nary action of the causes influencing the plant in its natural condition, if this process

were repeated upon the progeny of the original plants, and upon their offspring in
continued succession, so as to imitate as far as we can the actual influences which take

effect in nature, and the whole series of experiments were continued for a long period
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

twenty, thirty, perhaps fifty years would scarce be sufficient; then, I think, those who
shall succeed us, to whom we bequeathe the results, will he enabled far more safely

than we can to establish a theory as to the nature of the relations of individual forms

amongst plants.

   Even those who conceive the hypothesis of the descent of all the individuals of a
species from a common original to be an essential point in natural history, cannot

afford to dispense with such a course of inquiry ; for admitting the hypothesis, there is

yet no practical test afforded by which to recognise the members of the species in

groups where these are subject to great variation, nor can such a test be supplied in

any other manner. Still more, those who believe it to be unphilosophical and in no

way necessary to assume the truth of an hypothesis supported merely as the one in
question is by a priori considerations, whatever probability we may choose to assign

to it, will desire that a body of facts hearing so directly on the question should here-

after be forthcoming.

It might also be desirable that a few members of the Section should associate for

the purpose of collecting and arranging such well-established facts respecting the va-

riations of plants as observed either in the natural state or in cultivation, as now lie
scattered through botanical works, or may hereafter he supplied by observers, with a

view to illustrating the value of specific characters in various groups.

   As to the modifications proposed in the forms of descriptive botany, it appears to
me that it should be an essential point in the character of a genus to assign, not merely

the points of structure in which all the species of the genus agree, but also those which,

varying from one species to another within the genus, yet remain constant throughout

the subordinate varieties of these species, thus supplying what we call the specific

characters within the group. An attempt of this kind, however imperfect, would at

once ensure an accumulation of important facts, and by embodying these into our

systematic arrangement, would prepare the way for important generalisations. An

immediate result would be, that we should hereafter less frequently find one supposed

species of a genus rejected because its characters had been proved to be variable, while

another species of the same genus is admitted, though possessing exactly the same and

no better distinctive characters.

The other modification which I propose has a similar tendency with the last. It

will not he considered improbable to assert as I do, from the study of several com-

plicated groups, that in species of the same genus, the varieties of any single species,
considered as diverging from a common typical form, recur in a similar cycle through-

out all the species of that genus ; and if, as is usual, we indicate varieties by letters of

the alphabet, it seems natural to ask, that in describing a given group, the same letter

should always indicate the same corresponding variety, each letter receiving from the

amfirst a fixed signification. I   inclined to go one step further than this. It is now

admitted that there are two very distinct classes of varieties ; the first, properly so

called, represent the initial variations produced by modifying causes ; they appear

amongst the offspring of one parent plant, and usually return to the primary form as

soon as the modifying action ceases, either in their own persons or in those of their

descendants; the second, conveniently named sub-species, are permanent, and only

after several successive generations do they return to the typical form, if indeed they

be capable of so returning, which is scarcely yet established. Now, I assert, there is

evidence to show that if we take the cycle of varieties displayed amongst the offspring

of the original or typical plant, we shall find a cycle of sub-species, sometimes of course

incomplete, exhibiting the same tendencies to variation of form in a more marked

manner, while in each sub-species the same cycle of varieties is again repeated. Now
if it be admitted that this law may hold good throughout, there will be no objection

to designating the varieties each successively by a small letter, and each correspond-

ing sub-species by a large letter of the same kind. It is needless to point out how a

range of facts would thus be admitted into our systematic arrangements.

Onthe Specific Characters of Plants, considered in Morphological Connexion.

                                By J. Ball, M.R.I.A.

Bearing in mind the two fundamental principles of the unity of primitive structure

throughout all the organs of vegetation, and on the other hand, the connexion be-

tween function and structure, as the latter is actually modified in nature, it has ever

appeared to me a highly probable if not necessary conclusion, that where, in exami-

ning a group of vegetable forms, we find in proceeding from one individual to another

differences of structure in various organs, these varieties are mutually connected to-

gether by fixed laws, so that a variation in one organ shall invariably accompany the

variation of another, not by a mere accidental relation, but one which we may hope

to trace and to establish. The main difficulty of introducing into botany this method,

which has been so successfully employed in comparative anatomy by palasontologists,

is, that the latter have been guided and directed by a knowledge of the functions of the

several organs whose' structural relations they would discover, while in botany, where

we have so slight a knowledge of the special functions of the various appendages, we

must, if we would at all ascertain their structural relations, seek them in a careful induc-

tion  from  an  extensive  series  of observations                                                                    thus only  may we  hope  to reconstruct  a

lost plant from some single leaf or portion of its inflorescence. The first step will na-

turally be made in finding the relations between those organs in which the primary

function has been the least altered, as between the leaf, the bracts, sepals or corolla,

rather than with those of the stamens or pericarp, where the primitive organ has been

altogether metamorphosed for the purpose of fulfilling a completely different purpose

in the vegetable oeconomy. Accordingly we do in fact find in many natural orders

examples of this law. I might derive some illustrations from the Compositse, but for

the present shall only refer to a small group of Gramineae, the whole of which order

is well-adapted for this purpose.

   The group in question contains three European species of Polypogon, namely,

&P, monspeliensis, Dsf., P. maritimus, R. S., and P. suhspathaceus, Lois., in which the

accordance between the variations of the leaf with unrolled sheath and those of the

exterior glume is very remarkable. ____^__

           On the Geographical Distribution of Plants in British India.
                                     By Dr. RoYLE.

    This paper contained an outline of the varied vegetation of India, occupying, as it
does, almost the extremes of heat and cold, as well as those of dryness and moisture.
The materials of this paper were chiefly supplied from the author's own observations.
The number of species in India he estimated at 1 0,000, belonging to 200 families.
The latter part of the paper was occupied with a description of the vegetation of the
lakes. Plants are in them excessively abundant, and eventually fill them up with
their debris. The author thought that the deposits of vegetable matter in these lakes

threw much light on the formation of coal.

                                 By Professor Andrews.

   The author having studied the Irish Saxif\-ages, and compared them with those of
the Pyrenees, had come to a different conclusion from Mr. Babington, and helieved
that there were only two true species in Ireland, the Saxifraga umbrom and the S.
Geum. The other species described by Mr. Babington in his ' Manual,' he regarded
as varieties of one or other of these forms.

   Capt. L. L, V. S. Ibbetson exhibited a collection of electrofyped plants. Most of
the specimens belonged to the family Orchidacece, but there were many specimens of
other plants, and some fungi, with their forms beautifully preserved.

   The process by which they were prepared was the ordinary electrotyping process
but various expedients were had recourse to, according to the nature of the plant.
Some difficulty was experienced in sinking the plant in the solution of copper. This
was always least in plants which were brought from hot-houses. The parts of the
plants on the surface were perfectly preserved, and many of them retained their

specific characters.

   On the Increase of the Ergot upon Grasses. By R. G. Latham, M.D.

   The increase of the Ergot upon grasses is real ; not merely apparent, and referable
to a greater amount of observations. Eight years ago, having found a single specimen
upon the Alopecurus pratensis, the author sought for it carefully, autumn after autumn,
but in vain, until 1842. Since then it has been abundant; being found on a variety
of species, and over large areas. Of the eighteen species on which he has found it,
it is commonest on the Lolium perenne, rarest on the Hordeum murinum. It was
found last year for the first time on a water-grass, viz. the Glyceriwn fluitans. The
Phleums and Fescues are very subject to it; so is the Dactylis glomerata; in other
words, some" of the best pasture grasses. The Cynosurus cristatus is remarkably free
from it.

                       On the Turf of the Cambridgeshire Fens.
                  By the Rev. L. Jenyns, M.J., F.L.S., F.G.S.

   The remarks made by the author in this communication related principally to the
fens in the neighbourhood of Swaffham Bulbeck, and to Iselham fen. It was stated

that the Cambridgeshire turf was not formed of Sphagnum, like the peat found in
many of the mosses in England and Scotland, but owed its origin to decomposed

aquatic plants of various species associated with the remains of trees. This circum-

stance appears to have given rise to two kinds of turf, which are distinguished by the
turf-diggers in the above districts by the names of upper and lower. The upper turf
is much more compact and heavy than the lower, and generally of a darker colour,

though sometimes with a peculiar reddish tinge : this is the best turf for common
fires, and burns to a white ash. The lower turf is lighter and lighter-coloured, and
its texture becomes more loose and spongy the lower it is dug : this is the best for
ovens (though now the only turf used in some places from the scarcity of the other
kind), and burns to a red ash. These two kinds of turf appear to pass gradually one

into the other, the lower consisting almost entirely of the bark, wood, roots, and
branches of former forests, above which the upper has been formed afterwards, and
deposited in successive layers. The thickness of the whole bed is very variable. In
SwaflPham Bulbeck fen it runs, perhaps, in general from two to five feet. In Iselham
fen the deposit of upper turf (which is also much more heavy and compact in that
locality) is considerably thicker : the men there sometimes dig eight turf deep, each

being fifteen inches in length ; this however is an exception to the rule, and seldom
met with.

   The trees which are met with at the bottom of the moor, and which rest imme-
diately on the clay, consist chiefly of oak, yew, hazel and willow. It is said that in
Iselham fen they occasionally find the fir and the vine also. The stems of the larger
oaks are sound at heart and black throughout, though with the surface somewhat
decayed, and presenting an appearance as if charred. But many of the smaller trees,
or portions of them, are quite spongy, and may be cut as readily with the knife as soft
cheese : these are not unfrequently found penetrated through and through by the rhi-
i;oma of the common reed {Arundo phragmites) now growing in the fen.

   The two sorts of turf above distinguished are not always found together, The
upper exists without the lower in localities in which there are no buried trees to have
given rise to the latter; but wherever the lower is found, the upper has always existed
above it formerly, though now the upper has been so much removed in some districts
by digging that the lower alone remains. As the upper turf is due to the decay of
aquatic plants in a soil saturated with water, there would be nothing to prevent its
growth at the present day if the condition of the fen remained unchanged ; but in
fact, from repeated drainage, the fen is now much too dry in most places to allow of
the turf growing to a sufficient extent to compensate for the large quantity dug for
fuel. It is the opinion of the turf-diggers at Iselham that formerly the turf grew
about twenty inches in sixteen years (twenty inches being the length of a full-sized
turf when first cut). The lower turf, consisting entirely of the remains of trees
which grew in the spots in which they are now found before the fen was formed, it is
evident, can never be renewed when removed. Hence the time is not far distant when,
in some localities, the supply of turf for fuel must fail altogether.

   The principal plants observed first to show themselves in pits from which turf has
been dug, and which appear to assist greatly in its formation, are the Chara hispida
--76 REPORT 1845.

and C. gracilis, Utricularia vulgaris, Nymfhcea alba, Potamogeton (various species),
Sagitlaria sagittifolia, and Alisma rannnculoides. The Chara and Utricularia espe-
cially seem well-adapted for causing a rapid accumulation of vegetable remains by the
constant decaying of their stems at bottom, while their upper extremities continue to
make fresh shoots. After, however, the accumulation has proceeded to a certain ex-
tent, the pits are so far lessened in depth that at the present day the water no longer

Astagnates there in summer. different kind of vegetation in consequence then takes

place. The above plants make way for various species of Junci, Carices, and other
grasses, which tend rapidly to fill the pits up, but which, growing above the level to
which the fen is now saturated with water, are not subjected to the conditions under
which alone the formation of turf is possible.

On Fizeau's Process of Etching Daguerreotype Plates, and its Application to
                  Objects of Natural History. By A. Goadby.

    In a Daguerreotype portrait, the black parts of the plate consist of silver, the white
of mercury, and the intermediate tint of a mixture of the two, the degree of darkness
or light depending upon the excess either of the silver or of the mercury. In con-
verting a Daguerreotype into an engraved plate, it is necessary to etch away the dark
parts and to leave the white untouched. This is done by immersing the plate in a
fluid, consisting of dilute nitric acid, nitrous acid, chloride of sodium, and nitrate of
potash. The nitric acid is so far diluted, that no decomposition can take place until
the mixture is heated, when the chloride of sodium and nitrate of potash are decom-
posed, and chlorine and nitrous acid are evolved. These attack and remove the silver
of the dark portions of the plate, but have no effect on the mercury, so that the lights
or the picture, being the mercurialized portions of the plate, constitute the etching
ground, and effectually defend such portions of the Daguerreotype from the influence
of the corroding fluid. After a time, those portions of the plate that have been acted
upon by the chlorine, &c. become covered with a protecting coat of the chloride of

silver : this must be removed by dilute liquid ammonia, when the biting may be con-
tinued by a fresh supply of the mixed acid. Grease and foreign matter must be
removed by repeated washings in dilute acid and alkali, and by boiling in caustic

potash. These cleansing operations must be repeated after every biting, after washing
out the chloride of silver by the ammonia. The plate being thus bitten, but in a
slight degree, is to be inked after the ordinary manner of engravers, and allowed to
dry ; the surface of the plate is then to be thoroughly polished, the ink still remaining
in the corroded portions of the plate. It is now to be gilded by the electrotype, those
parts alone receiving the gold that have been previously polished. The ink is then
to be dissolved out of the hollows by potash : the parts that are gilded now constitute
the etching-ground, instead of the mercury, and the biting may be henceforth con-
tinued by nitric acid, in the customary usage of engravers. The plate thus etched
generally requires to be finished by the hand of the engraver, who has the advantage
of a perfect, although faint picture to work upon. The amount of labour which he
must bestow will depend upon the goodness of the Daguerreotype and the success of
the etching. M. Claudet has fully established the successful application of this pro-
cess to the purposes of illustrating natural history, by copying from nature and en-
graving several delicate and difHcult dissections of the lower animals, particularly the
nervous system oi Aplysia and Tritonia (the latter much magnified), and the nutri-
mental organs in sitti of a caterpillar. [These preparations, together with the en-
gravings of them, were submitted to the examination of the members.]

   The adoption of the measurements proposed, the author contends, will furnish a
more accurate means of identification than the method now in use, and at the same
time give important data for ethnological inquiry. The apparatus consists of two

         On the Ethnography of America. By R. G. Latham, M.D.

   It is considered that the line of demarcation drawn between the Esquimaux lan-
guages and those of the rest of America is too broad and definite. The same remark
applies to the Esquimaux tongues and those of Asia. By exaggerating these distinc-
tions t\ie prima facie view of the Indian population of America has been disturbed.
Further complications have also been introduced, by insisting upon the general gram-
matical analogy between the American languages as a point of contrast to the dif-
ference in their glossarial details. There is however for the whole of America, North
and South, a glossarial as well as a grammatical afl&nity.

   The Esquimaux, Athabascan, Colooeh, Oregon, Californian and Mexican groups
run so much into each other that no definite line of separation can be drawn.
These, dealt with en masse, have general affinities with the Algonkin and Iroquois
groups. Isolated tongues, like the Blackfoot, Riccaree, Uchee, &c., have miscella-
neous affinities with the American tongues in general, and contain Esquimaux words
proportionate to the extent of their vocabularies. The North and South American

tongues pass into each other. No South American tongue is isolated in the way
that the Basque is isolated in Europe. Even the Warow and Fuegian have words
common to the other groups, and to the Esquimaux.

   On the side of Asia the languages most akin to the Esquimaux are the Curnle,

Corean and Japanese j after these the Kamskadale, Koriack and Jukageer. Still, the
affinity (although undoubted) is less close on the Asiatic than the American side. The
difference between the American numerals is explicable on the following hypothesis.

Where we count by pure abstract terms like one, tiuo, three, &c., there is a greater

uniformity for the numerals than for other words; whilst in those ruder languages,

where we count by common names, as pair, couple, leash, the numerals differ where

the rest of the language coincides.

          On the Ethnography of the Chinese and Indo-Chinese Nations.
                                By R. G. Latham, M.D.

   The distinction between the languages of Thibet and China, as exhibited by Klap-
roth, must be only provisional. Over and above the grammatical analogy there is
an absolute glossarial affinity. Of the languages of the transgangetic peninsula the
same may be asserted. Where languages are monosyllabic slight changes make
palpable differences. The vocabularies of Brown, for more than a score of the Bur-
mese and Siamese tongues, have provided us with data for ethnographical compari-
sons. By dealing with these collectively, we find in one dialect words which had
been lost in others. The Chinese, Thibet, Bhootan, Burmese, Siamese, and all the
so-called monosyllabic languages hitherto known, are allied to each other. The ge-
neral affinities of the Indo-Chinese tongues are remarkable. With Marsden's and
Sir Stamford Raffles's tables on the one side, and those of Brown and Klaproth on
the other, it can be shown that a vast number of Malay roots are monosyllabic. The
Malay languages are monosyllabic ones, with the superaddition of inflections evolved
out of composition, and euphonic processes highly developed.

   The next class of tongues akin to the monosyllabic is that of Caucasus. The
numerous languages of this class have long been reduced to four groups; the Geor-
gian, the Lesgian, the Circassian, the Mizdzhegi. That these four are fundamentally
one, may be seen from Klaproth's tables, whose classification seems only provisional.
These tongues, dealt with en masse, have their affinities with the monosyllabic
tongues. As with the Malay language, the monosyllabic character is modified by
the evolution of agglutinational and inflectional processes, but not much by euphonic
processes. An original continuity of language, displaced at present by the Turkish
and Mongol, is thus assumed for parts between Caucasus and Thibet.

On thepresent state ofPhilological Evidence as to the Unity of the Human Race.
                                  J?7/ R. G.Latham, M.Z).

   The languages of America are radically one, compared both with one another, and

with those of the north-east of Asia, viz. the Kamskadale, Koriack, Curile, Corean,
Japanese. Tlie particular language of the Othomi inhabitants of Mexico, which
has been considered as monosyllabic and isolated in character, forms no exception
to the previous statement.

   A monosyllabic basis of separate words is provisionally assumed as the fundamental

element out of which inflections are evolved by agglutination and amalgamation.
This makes it possible that poly-synthetic tongues, like the American, may be repre-
sented in their earlier stage by monosyllabic tongues like the Chinese, Glossarial
investigations confirm both these views. There is a radical unity for the different
Siberian groups of the Asia Polyglotta, e.g. Yukageer, Yenesean, Samoeide, &c., and
a fortiori, for the Turk, Mongol, and Manchoo groups. Each and all of these have
affinities with the monosyllabic tongues, and through these with the Malay and
Caucasian.

   NewPolynesia presents the first appearance of isolation, in the languages of

Guinea, Australia, &c., t. e. the Negrito tongues. The philological evidence of their
being akin, either to the Malay or Tamul languages, is at present indefinite and in-

conclusive.

    Southern India, and the Indian hill-ranges, present the first appearance of isola-
tion in the languages of Continental Asia. Although unplaced they can scarcely be

called isolate.

   The African languages have a fundamental unity; philological processes and ex-

tended comparisons being sufficient to account for the apparent peculiarities of the
Caffrarian tongues.

 --Europe presents unplaced languages in the Basque and Albanian unplaced, but

not therefore isolate. The higher groups that should contain divisions like the Se-
mitic and Indo-European, &c., have yet to be evolved. These, along with positions
for the Basque, Albanian, and Tamul languages, and affinities for the Negrito and
African languages in general, are the present desiderata. The philological unity
of those portions of the human race of which the languages are known, although
highly probable, has yet to be exhibited in a definite and conclusive form.

         On the Migratory Tribes of Central India. By E. Balfour.

   It has not been ascertained how many wandering tribes there are : the author

confined himself to the description of the manners and habits of seven. Although
in many respects they are similar to each other, still there are differences which have
interest in an ethnological point of view.

   Dr. King exhibited, on the part of Mr. John Brown, a drawing of a specimen of

gold casting as illustrative of the state of art of the inhabitants of New Grenada prior
to the conquest. It represented the human figure sitting. The original was of fine

gold, and weighed 1 oz. 18dwt. ISgrs.

       On the Moral and Intellectual Character of the New Zealanders.
                                     By Dr. Martin.

   The New Zealander may be classed in that stage of man's progression when the

indications of sense are not altogether corrected by reflection and intellect ; when
passion is somewhat tempered, but net controlled by moral and religious feeling;
when hatred is stronger than benevolence, and self-love is unrestrained by consci-
entiousness; when, in fact, the mere intellectual perception of self-interest is the
chief regulator of the conduct. As far as mere perceptive faculties are concerned,

the New Zealander may be said to be inferior to Europeans, but superior to many
other uncivilized people. The New Zealander is a paradox in every light in which

we regard his moral character. Religion, veneration, or superstition, are the strongest
feelings, and yet they are, in most cases, unaccompanied by conscientiousness, which
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  79

is so essential to the formation of a moral and religious character. He has laws

which define conduct, but they are founded on self-interest, superstition or vanity.
Truth and moral feeling cannot be traced as elements in any part of his conduct or
customs. His excessive Viinity and want of truthfulness make him boastful, and
tend to give an exaggerated character to all his statements. Individual quarrels or
combats are of rare occurrence; while the most extraordinary disregard for life will

be found to exist without courage. Notwithstanding the general character of theNew

Zealander for benevolence, he is destitute of natural affection as a feeling : neither
the parent nor the child cherish towards each other any of that strong regard which

is natural to, and frequent among Europeans. His social morality is low, the
absence of virtue not being considered even a disgrace, much less a crime.

                           On Cretinism. By Dr. Twining.

   Dr. Twining first described its forms and degrees. Marsden saw goitre in the
valleys of the Ural, Baikal and Caucasian mountains; Forbes in the Himalaya, and
M'Clelland in the Shore Valley. Sir G. Staunton saw cretins in the narrow valleys
of Tartary, and that they lead a mere animal life, acting alone from the impulse of
their senses. In Africa there are only two parts known where goitre occurs. Leo
Africanus saw goitre in the high mountains of Atlas in Morocco, and MungoPark
among the Kong mountains in Bambara. Of cretinism in America we have fuller
accounts. Richardson saw goitre and cretins on the banks of the Saskatchewan,
and near the sources of the Elann and Friedeu rivers. Prof Barton states goitre to
be prevalent at Oneida among the Americans and the Dutch settlers, and in all the

State of New York, near the Mohawk river. It occurs also in Lower Canada, in

marshy districts. In South America goitre occurs independently of cretinism in
Nicaragua and Sante Fe. Humboldt saw the most frightful cases of goitre on the
Magdalena river, and chiefly higher, to the elevation of 6000 feet above the sea, on
the high plain of Bogota, and states that the copper-coloured natives were generally
free from goitre. It occurs also in Quito and the Onachiffa Valley near Lima, under
various atmospheric influences, and on the Corderillas. In the Villarica Valley, in
Brazil, 4000 feet above the sea, goitre is frequent, not only in man but animals, as
the goat; and many villages are filled with cretins. Prof. PdfBg states that in the
Andes in Chili, on the east side, in some races he did not see a case of goitre; and
yet in the white inhabitants, who live exactly as the natives, it pcevails in a great

degree. On the Andes, between Santa Rosa and Mendoza, the peasants dwell on

the west side as high as 7000 feet above the sea, and on the east to 6000 feet, and
are free from goitre, but lower, at 3500 feet, goitre is endemic. The nature of the
formation seems to have no direct influence as a cause of cretinism, as cretins are
found on all. It would seem that where the springs come from the limestone, goitre
is most frequently endemic; but as in many villages where goitre and cretinism pre-
vail there is no lime, it cannot be the sole cause. Dr. Twining concluded by ex-
pressing a hope that the many travellers there assembled would, when investigating
the geology or the races of the high mountain chains, not forget the state of the in-
habitants of the valleys with regard to cretinism. That cretins can become healthy
and intelligent has been proved by Dr. Guggenbiihl, in the success that his benevo-
lent exertions at the Hospital for cretin children, on the Abenberg, near Inter-
lachen, have met with; but it can only be by the united efforts of many that a scien-
tific account of cretinism can be attained. In order to facilitate such inquiries. Dr.
Twining suggested the following method : first, to state the name of the place, its
situation and elevation above the sea, and the race; second!}', tlie geological forma-

--tion, springs and climate ; thirdly, the state of the houses and the habits whether

goitre only prevails, or is accompanied by cretinism.

       On the Natives of Old Calebar, Africa, By Professor Danieil.

   The natives, although of Eboe extraction, present some physical deviations that
serve to distinguish them from other tribes of a similar derivation. The natives of
the Bonny Mun, who are purely of Eboe descent, and therefore less mixed with the
people of other nations, may be taken as the typical illustration to institute compa-

risons. They are generally of a short stature, slight form, and light yellow skin. The

trunk and other portions of the body are in conformity with this physical configuration,

being somewhat robust and symmetrical in mould, with a tendency to great muscular

development. The hair of the head of girls is invariably shaved off, with the excep-

tion of a small tuft, and is not suffered to grow until they are married ; it is then

twisted into a number of plaits decorated with beads. Portions of their frame, and

particularly the face, are tattooed in circular figures, and the anterior surface of the

arm, in men as well as women, is ornamented with round smooth cicatrices of the

size of a shilling. The government of this people is a monarchical despotism, rather

mild in its general character. They destroy their criminals by poisoning, drowning

Aand decapitation.  simple contract between the parties constitutes the law of

marriage; and prior to their residing finally together, they sit in state for several
days, well-attended and in gaudy attire. Polygamy exists amongst them in full force.

Adultery is atoned for by a dreadful death. Among their funeral rites is that of im-
molation, on an enormous scale, of men, women and children ; and so fearful in
former times was the observance of this custom, that many towns narrowly escaped

depopulation.       _______

   Dr. King reported that in the Journal of General Miller, Consul-General for the
Pacific, which had been forwarded to him, light was thrown upon the manners and
habits of the South Sea Islanders, and upon many of the complicated or debated

problems connected with the population and its intermixture with the Red man of
America; upon human sacrifice, cannibalism and infanticide ; and upon the effect of
isolation and savage solitude upon runaways from ships and from convict labour.
Lengthened extracts from General Miller's Journal, upon these several points, were

read.

  On certain Traces of Roman Colonization in Lancashire. By Dr. Black.

   From historical notices and inferences, conjoined with the affinities mentioned to
have existed between the social institutions and languages of the Saxon conquerors
and other contemporary emigrants and those of our Briton-Frisians, Dr. Black con-
cludes that the latter would mostly remain in the country, become amalgamated in
spirit, action and habits with the newly imported tribes from Germany, rather than

seek to keep up a forced conventional polity with their old neighbours, the Britons.
They would indeed soon become incorporated with the Saxons ; take with them
their fate as a nation ; and from their numbers in the south of Lancashire, would
probably constitute the greatest portion of the population. That many of the inha-
bitants of this district, especially in the inland and rural parts, have long, and to this
day, shown a distinctive variety of form, feature and vernacular dialect from those in

the other parts of England, has been remarked by not a few observers. And the

--man of Heaton and the dark-eyed Lancashire witch still maintain the one for the

picturesque in manners and speech, and the other for her characteristic beauty
their wide-spread distinction among the hardy sons and fair daughters of England.

On Local and Hereditary Difference of Complexion in Great Britain, with
    some Incidental Notice of the Cimhri. By the Rev. R, Williams.

Mr. Williams commented on the fact, that in two districts of our island, the same

strongl3'-marked variety of complexion exists which was observed by Tacitus seven-

teen centuries ago. The primary agent of change was climate; which influenced

first the skin, next the hair and eyes, and lastly, with the co-operation, perhaps, of

other agents, changed the configuration of the skull. Next to our own climate, that

of our ancestors, or the effect of race, was to be considered. It had been attempted

to explain the xanthous complexion of the Scotch Lowlanders by supposing them

originally Gothic, and the darker hues of the S.W. Silurians by calling in the aid of

Iberian intermixture. The last was wrong; for as the language of the Welsh con-

tained no Basque element, their physiology could not have been influenced by

Biscayans. The former idea had been partially refuted by Chalmers; and looking to

the names of the Pictish kings, of places in the Lowlands, comparing the Welsh Aber

with the Gaelic Suver, observing the intelligibility of Aneirin's poems among the

Britons of the Clyde and those of South Wales, we must conclude that the whole

western side of the island, from Glasgow to Cornwall, was inhabited by a people

throughout akin, if not absolutely identical. Neither was it true that the Celts could

be classed as dark, and the Teutons as xanthous. All ancient authors, and especially

Strabo, made the Celts also xanthous. Strabo even thought their usages alike, and

their blood akin to the Germans. He called the Britons of greater stature and less
yellow-haired than the Gauls. On the whole, this singular phaenomenon of a people

homoio, if not homo-glottous, yet differing physiologically so much as the Caledonians

and Silurians, and their respective successors at this day, might be referred to the

well-ascertained custom of the Celts of migrating in two large divisions, as in the

case of Brennus, &c. One division, leaving the Caspian, entered Europe by the

Euxine, and the other by the Mediterranean ; one acquired the characteristics of a

Northern, the others retained those of an Oriental people. Mr. Williams proceeded

to show, by tracing various names, that the whole people from Glasgow to Cornwall

called themselves Cimbri, or Cymry. This people comprehended the Belgae, and

(excepting only a Teuton inlet from the succeeding tide of population which forced

itself along the Rhine) they must have extended from Denmark and the mouth of

the Elbe across Belgic Gaul and England to Wales. It was very important to observe

that they were not hybrid, but yet formed, in blood and in language, as in geographi-

cal position, the connecting link between the Irish Celts who preceded, and the

Goths who came after them. Adelung's idea of the Cumraic containing a Gothic

infusion arose from the old fallacy of the Celts and Goths being radically alien
whereas one family of languages extended from the Caspian Sea to Ireland and Por-
tugal on the west, and to the extreme of India on the east. Certain peculiarities in
the Celtic and Cumraic arose from the very early date at which they successively
broke off from the prae-Sanscrit stock.

current amongst the rest of the uncivilized portion of the globe.

 Results of Researches on the Scrofulous Tubercle* which had reference to its

                           Vascularity. By Dr. Fisher.

 All the cases which the author brought forward were illustrated by coloured drawings.
 He treated of two kinds of tubercle : the one developed in the subserous cellular tissue,
 as for instance between the laminae of the mesentery, or between the peritoneum and
 the muscular coat of the intestine ; the other formed at the expense of the parenchyma

 of an organ, as for instance the lung, a lymphatic gland, &c. In the first case, ac-
 cording to Dr. Fisher's observations, the morbid product would seem, at a certain
 period of its development, to become surrounded by blood-vessels comparatively large
 in calibre, and apparently of a new order, which converge towards the tubercle, some-
 what after the fashion in which the spokes of a wheel are directed towards its nave.
  In the second case, where, for instance, the tubercle is seated in the lung, the nutri-
 tive vessels of that organ, i. e. the bronchial arteries, would appear to assume around
 the morbid product an increase not only in size, but also in number. The semi-
 transparent form of tubercle, especially as it is found in lymphatic glands, would ap-

 pear to be the one most richly endowed with vessels : the latter are much less fre-
 quently met with in the opake caseous form; still, in several instances, vessels arti-
 ficially injected were shown to enter the caseous tubercle, towards the centre of which

  they appeared to tend.

 On a peculiar form of Epidemic affecting the Teeth and Gums of young
    Children, observed in Dublin in the Winter of 1844-45. By James F.
     Duncan, A.M., M.B., F.C.P. in Ireland, ^c.

     This peculiar disease was observed among the children of the North Dublin Union
  Workhouse, an institution containing nearly 2000 inmates of all classes, and averaging
  usually from sixty to eighty infants under two years of age, to which the author has
  been physician since its opening, five years ago. Until last winter he had never ob-
  served anything approaching in character to the present affection, of which he met
  with eight or nine cases. The attack was ushered in by considerable fever, and after
  an interval of some days the gums were found to be partially ulcerated at the inser-
  tioVi of the teeth, the fangs being exposed ; they became also swollen, red and spongy,
  and exhibited a considerable tendency to bleed, insomuch that htemoptoe occasionally
  resulted from this cause. The disease was very severe, and in most cases, either di-
  rectly or in consequence of a relapse, terminated fatally. It seemed to be essentially
  only a part of a deeper-seated affection, namely, an enteritis of'a most extensive and
  severe kind. Its importance however, in a pathological point of view, arose from the
 liability to confound it with that ulceration of the gums which is the consequence of
 the administration of mercury. In some of these cases no mercury whatever had

been used, and in none was the quantity sufficient to account for its occurrence. The
importance of distinguishing the two affections must be obvious to every one. The
diagnosis rests principally on the ulceration being partial and not general over the
whole gums, as is the case in mercurial action, in the accompanying ptyalism being
moderate in quantity, in the fcetor of the breath being destitute of the peculiar odour
of the mineral impregnation, and in the tendency to haemorrhage. This last seems
to connect it rather with Purpura hemorrhagica than with the former affection. The
sanguineous discharges were not confined to the gums, but extended also to the rectum
and intestines ; and the author related a remarkable case of two children, one of whom
had the affection of the mouth and the other Purpura hcemorrhagica. But the im-
portance of the diagnosis is still further shown from the circumstance that in this
disease mercurial remedies can be administered, not only without risk, but even with
advantage. The treatment found of greatest benefit was not local but constitutional.
The former seemed to exercise very little impression even upon the parts to which it
was applied; the latter alone was productive of relief. Acidulated infusions of bark
and calumba were particularly serviceable, but the application of a tolerably large
blister over the abdomen after it had been stimulated by the mustard poultice, and
left on for about an hour, was more effectual in checking the accompanying diarrhoea,
lowering the fever and improving the general condition of the patient than anything

else.

On the Influence of Galvanism on Endosmose and Exosmose.
                By H. B. Leeson, M.A., M.D.

   Whether endosmose and exosmose are dependent on electricity, capillary attraction
or chemical affinity, or on some mechanical condition having relation to the magnitude
of the particles of the fluids, subjected to its influence and to the pores of the membrane
through which they pass, has not at present been satisfactorily determined.

   The first idea of Dutrochet, that electricity was the more immediate cause*, is now
generally abandoned ; nor can we be surprised that Dutrochet himself should have
felt some misgivings on the subject, if we refer to the experiments of Porrett and him-
self, on which that opinion was founded.

   The author entered into an examination of these experiments, and then proceeded
to explain those in which he is at present engaged. After adverting to the fact now

familiar to most persons accustomed to the use of the sustaining galvanic battery, viz.
that the liquid on the one side of the porous diaphragm was considerably increased

or elevated by the action of the battery, the author explained that such increase could
not depend, as had been supposed, upon any mere variation of the specific gravity of
the fluids, inasmuch as that the height attained by the liquid, as exhibited in the
arrangement of an experiment then exhibited, was much greater than could be due
to any alteration of specific gravity, and amounted in some of the author's experi-
ments to several feet. The author then alluded to his experiments, as proving that
endosmose and exosmose were greatly promoted by electricity, more especially ob-
serving that sulphuric acid, a substance mentioned by Dutrochet as inimical to the
influence of endosmose, was in the experiment before them rendered amenable thereto.

The author also observed, that although endosmose and exosmose may be induced

without any galvanic influence, and are not therefore absolutely dependent upon it,
still, inasmuch as the action took place more readily under the influence of the cur-
rent, and almost ceased when the current was interrupted, we must conclude that
endosmose and exosmose are powerfully promoted by it.

   The great amount of force or motion generated by the action of endosmose and
exosmose was then observed. Endosmose and exosmose continually going on in so
many parts of the animal ceconomy may be regarded as equivalent to the continued
action of a condensing and exhausting syringe, and probably contribute to promote
the action of the heart, as stated by the author some years ago in a thesis upon the
blood, read by him at Oxford.

    The author then adverted to the relative alkaline and acid state of the fluids secreted

from the surfaces of different membranes, as presenting conditions favourable to the
production of galvanic currents. The author also adverted to the experiments of

duction of electric currents exist in animals even where there is no special organizii-

relation to this subject, since the healthy performance of all the important functions
of the animal oeconomy are dependent upon it.

On a new mode of Suture, applicable to Plastic Operations.
        By Charles Brooke, M.B., F.R.C.S.E.

The inconvenience frequently experienced by surgeons in the application of the

ordinary modes of suture is that of the stitches cutting through, and therefore failing

to keep in contact the parts to be united. In this, the improvement consists in placing,

two smooth, flat glass beads on the ends of the ligature and securing them by knots,

by which the parts may be held together as long as may be required without any

tendency to produce irritation or ulcei'ation. The mode of application may be thus
--Aexplained :
                piece of ligature silk with a knot on one end is doubled, and the loop

Apassed through a bead.  needle of suitable form, having a notch near the point, is

then passed through the sides of the fissure to be united ; the loop of the ligature is

Athen placed in the notch and the needle retracted, bringing the loop with it. second

bead is then placed on the loop, which is afterwards divided ; the two tlireads being

now separate, a knot is tied on the end of that one which has no knot at the other end,
and by drawing the two free ends of the threads, the parts intervening may be brought

into close contact, and may be maintained in that position by placing knots on the

free ends, close to the beads, and thus preventing the latter from receding from each

other; at the same time the portions of integument intervening between the beads

are not subjected to any pressure whatever.

For external application of the suture, a needle slightly curved at the point is most

suitable. For internal application, when the direction of the edges to be united co-

incides with that of the handle of the instrument, as in a longitudinal fissure in the

vagina, a spirally-curved needle is requisite : when the direction of the edges is

nearly perpendicular to that of the instrument, as in the posterior part of a cleft

palate, or a transverse fissure in the vagina, a moveable needle is most suitable. The

principal difficulty attending the internal application of the bead suture, has been the

placing the last knots close to the beads, to prevent their receding from each other

this may however be effected by a small conoidal roller at the extremity of a handle,

on which the loop forming the knot is placed, and carried on to any required point;

it is then tightened by a little fork attached to this instrument, wide enough to receive

the thread only. By these means any number of knots may with facility be placed

on the same thread close to each other, when entirely out of reach of the fingers.

In order to render the description of the operation complete, it must be remarked,

that in the application of external sutures, as in cases of hare-lip, it is generally found

desii'able to pare the edges with the scalpel, and union by first intention will probably

be obtained : in internal sutures, the edges will be much more easily and evenly

pared by lightly touching them with potassa fusa, and the needle immediately ap-

plied, without waiting for the separation of the superficial slough. To the latter mode

of treatment it may be objected, that imion can thus be obtained by granulation only

this is not however an objection of any validity, as it is the peculiar property of this

suture to hold the parts in contact until sufficient time has elapsed to render the union

suture will be more suitable for a purely medical publication.

 On the Communicating Fibres of the Brain in reference to ThougJu and
                    Action. By Thomas Laycock, M.I).

   Dr. Laycock stated, that he considered those views correct which looked on the brain
as an extensive periphery of nervous matter, analogous to that on the surface of the

body. On this periphery sensorial changes are excited, first, by incident excitor im-

--pressions derived from without the external periphery ; secondly, by impressions
--derived from other portions of the brain the internal periphery. There was thus a

set of intercommunicating fibrils between all parts of each symmetrical half of the

brain and spinal cord. Dr. Laycock showed that this intercommunication actually
took place in the ganglia of the spinal cord, an impression being diffused through all
parts of the ganglia. Dr. Laycock showed that this view of the internal mechanism
of the brain explains those cases of paralysis in which the muscles act normally under
certain conditions, as, for example, when an individual cannot speak what he thinks,
but is able to read aloud, or repeat what is spoken. Dr. Laycock was of opinion that
in such an example there was no interruption of continuity between the auditory and
optic nerves and that part of the brain which subserves to language, nor between the
latter and the anterior or motor tract of the medulla oblongata; but that the cause of
the vocal paralysis experienced when the individual attempted to express his thoughts,
was an interruption of continuity of the fibrils communicating between the portions of
the brain, or internal periphery, subservient to thought and that subservient to lan-
guage.

which will permanently bear chalk-marks. By taking the outlines of the objects to

be sketched (deformities, well-marked conditions of thoracic or abdominal viscera, &c.)

on the surface looking perpendicularly at the object, a correct outline is easily pro-

duced even by those who are not artists ; this sketch can be readily transferred to
paper by pressure, and if necessary may be reduced by the application of the penta-

graph. Mr. Sibson gave an illustration of its use by making sketches from the living

body, and entered into numerous pathological details to show the importance of fre-

                 On Cranial Vertebrce. By Dr. Macdonald.

   The author commenced by enforcing the value and necessity of the study of what
had been termed Transcendental Anatomy. After alluding to the labours of the
foreign and British investigators of the subject, Dr. Macdonald laid down the elemen-
tary parts forming a vertebra, which he stated to be, first, a body forming part of the
eaulis centralis of the vertebral column ; secondly, the posterior laminas, which meeting
on the mesial plane form the arch of the vertebral canal, having the spinous processes
more or less developed ; each lamina is again subdivided into three elementary divi-
sions, which he denominates protomeral, deutomeral, and tritomeral ; besides these
there are, thirdly, anterior laminae connected with the eaulis centralis, exemplified in

the ribs and part of the pelvis, and also in the bones of the face. Retaining these

divisions of each vertebra, the author described the cranial vertebrae as three pairs

arising from the spine :  first, the occipital ;  secondly,  the  sphenoidal                                                 thirdly, the in-

grasioethmo-frontal ; by attentively examining the component laminae of these verte-

br£e, he identified all the usually described portions of the cranium. The facial bones he
resolved, into two pairs of vertebrae : first, the superciliary ; secondly, the adnasal. By

a minute demonstration the author endeavoured to establish the details of his system

which he contended was applicable to all the zoological classes, and as well-marked,

in the insect tribe as in the mammalia.

It consisted of a catheter or sound, with a circular sounding-board, six inches in

Adisease. The effect of the sounding-board was demonstrated.

the contact of a small fragment in a small bag, which could scarcely be heard by the

holder of the instrument without the sounding-board, became perfectly audible on its

application.

                                       STATISTICS.

     On the University Statistics of Germany. By J. Heywood, F.R.S.

The details of these statistics were collected by Dr. Perry, who resided in the Uni-

versity town of Bonn on the Rhine, and who has taken the degree of Dr. of Philo-
sophy at Gottingen. He stated, that in round numbers, there are 1500 professors
in the German' universities, and about 15,000 students. Dr. Perry ascribes the origin
of duelling among the German students to their being permitted to wear swords as a
badge of gentility; but the duels are generally of a harmless nature. Large num-
bers of students are attracted to particular universities in Germany by the lectures
of eminent professors, and when a vacancy occurs in a chair of importance, the new
teacher is often chosen on account of his reputation and success in some other uni-
versity, so that he owes his fresh appointment to his own merit, independent of local

influence.

On the Comparative Number of Degrees taken at Cambridge in the Seventeenth
               and Nineteenth Centuries. By J. Heyvfood, F.R.S.

    The comparison showed, that notwithstanding the general increase of wealth and
 population in Great Britain during the last 200 years, the number of degrees taken
 at Cambridge had not increased in a corresponding proportion. Thus, in 1620 there
 were 270 B.A. degrees conferred, and in 1820 only 183; in 1630 there were 291
 B.A. degrees taken, and in 1830,324; in 1640 there were 240, and in 1840, only
 339. Nearly one-third of the students leave the university without taking a degi-ee.
 Conversation ensued, and it was suggested that the more mature age at which stu-
 dents now enter was one cause why graduations have not increased in proportion to
 the population. Prof. Pryme observed that this might also arise from the compa-
                                                                                       ;

native cheapness and style of living in ancient times. Mr. Heywood also presented
ft table of the comparative number of students in Trinity College, Cambridge, who go
into lay pursuits and into the church. Of 1443 students admitted in ten years, from
1831 to 1840 inclusive, only 413 took out testimonials for deacons' orders, from
which it follows that about two-thirds of the students of Trinity College are intended
to be laymen.

            On the Trade and Navigation of Norway. By R. Valpy.

  [This was the abstract of a Report made to the Government by J. B. Crowe, Esq., Consul
                                                          General for Norway.]

    The chief exports are wood, fish, and minerals. The wood consists of deals cut in
 twelve-feet lengths, and balks either round or square. Proprietors of forests are
 under no restrictions as to felling ; they generally cut down the trees in autumn or
 wnter, and convey them to a river to be floated down the stream. The reproduction
 of the timber is believed to be equal to the consumption. Formerly England was the
 chief market for Norwegian produce, and had in return the almost exclusive trade in
 manufactures ; but since the establishment of discriminating duties in favour of Cana-
 dian timber the English trade has fallen, and the consumption of English manufac-
 tures greatly decreased. Hamburg and the German States have become markets for
Norwegian produce, and the manufactures of Germany have superseded those of
England. The annual avei-age quantities of timber exported in the seven years from
 1835 to 1841 were 618,769 loads of 50 cubic feet, which, with firewood, hoops, and
other less valuable timber, may be deemed worth 435,000/. The fisheries rank next
in importance to the forest, 'and afford the chief occupation to Norwegian industry.
The exports consist of stockfish, round and split, clip-fish, salted cod, and halibut,
liver and shark oil, and live lobsters. Stockfish is chiefly exported to the Catholic

--countries of southern Europe. The exports fluctuate from the varying nature of the

fishing trade, but in 1841 they were, stockfish, 14, 196 tons ; clip-fish, II, 285 tons;
herrings, 608,086 barrels ; cod-roes, 20,21 7 barrels ; liver and shark oils, 4 1,7 15 barrels
and 562,272 lobsters. Salmon for several years has ceased to be an article of export.
The disappearance of this fish is attributed to the swarms of sharks which have re-
cently taken possession of the banks off the coast. These were first observed in
1841, and in 1842 eight vessels were fitted out for the new fishery, and captured no
less than 20,000 sharks, without any apparent diminution of the supply. The quantity
of oil obtained was about 1000 barrels. The mineral trade is not of much importance,
but there is something curious in the fur trade, principally carried on with Russia.
The greater part of the skins sold by the Norwegians are obtained from the Hamburg
mercbants, who buy them in London from the Hudson's Bay Company; the Nor-
wegians convey them to Finmark, and from thence they are taken to Moscow and
sold to the caravan traders for the purpose of being bartered with the Chinese for
tea at Kiachta ! The Norwegian shipping is on the increase, principally owing to
tjje laws which require masters of vessels to give proof of their knowledge and skill

|iy undergoing a strict examination.

      On the Liability to Insanity at different Ages, By Dr. Thurnam.

   The general conclusion was, that the liability to insanity does not, as is generally
supposed, increase with years, but that it is greatest between the ages of twenty and
forty, and that it subsequently gradually diminishes. The author also adduced facts
which appeared to warrant the conclusion, that in some countries and communities
the liability to mental disorders is greatest between the ages of twenty and thirty;
whilst it is usually highest during the decennial period from thirty to forty years.

Sketch of the Progress and present Extent of Savings Banks in the United

   After a few preliminary remarks on their political and moral value, he stated that
these institutions owed their origin to Miss Priscilla Wakefield, who in 1804 induced
six gentlemen residing at Tottenham to receive deposits from labourers and servants,

paying 5 per cent, as interest. Four years later eight persons, half of whom were

ladies, took upon themselves the same responsibility at Bath, The first savings
bank regularly organized was formed at Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire ; its success led to
many imitations, so that before any legislative provision had been made for their
management, there were seventy savings banks in England, four in Wales, and four
in Ireland. In 1817 an act was passed to encourage banks of savings in England and
Ireland, but it was not extended to Scotland until 1835. Tabular statements of the
progress of these banks illustrated their great success, but we shall only take for
comparison the returns of two years, 1830 and 1844;

labourer. The hospitals were supported by assessments levied on the citizens and
the companies. By the charter of Edward the Sixth the government of these insti-
tutions was given to the Corporation of the City of London, but the chief power was
seized by the Court of Aldermen. Mr. Fletcher then explained the causes that placed
these institutions in the hands of self-elect governors, between whom and the corpo-
ration a kind of compromise was effected by Act of Parliament in 1782. But this

Act only provides for the election of forty-eight governors annually by the Common

Council, twelve for each hospital, Bethlehem being reckoned with Bridewell; and
as these form but a small minority among the total number of governors, the anoma-
lous self-elect constitution of these bodies continues to the present day. Mr. Fletcher
then entered into an elaborate detail of the various efforts that have been made to
suppress mendicancy by penal enactments, some of which were so severe as to vest
an arbitrary power of transportation in any two governors of Bridewell. In 1 708, the
London Workhouse, though of earlier origin, was first brought into full operation ; but
it fell into a state of inefficiency and was abolished. Mr. Fletcher then contrasted

the system of relief attempted by the Royal or Corporation Hospitals with the present

pauper administration of London, and showed how widely the hospitals had deviated

in practice from the principles at which their founders aimed.

Result of Inquiries into the State of the /Agricultural Labourers in the County of

                   Norfolk. By Sir John Boileau, Bart., F.R.S.

   Out of 680 parishes to which queries had been addressed, 426 sent returns. These
parishes contain 664,487 acres, of which 471,399 are arable. The total number of
labourers usually employed thereon is 23,058 labourers, of which 18,277 are above
20 years of age, and 4781 above 14 and under 20 years of age. Hence the average-
of labourers of all kinds to land of all kinds is 3^ to 100 acres. The average of la-
bourers of all kinds to arable land is nearly 5 to 100 acres. Labourers above 20 to
100 acres of all kinds 2^ to 100 acres. Labourers above 20 years of age to arable
land is 3| to lOO acres. Hence it was concluded that there was no surplus supply
of labour in the country, and that the land, if judiciously cultivated, would provide

    This paper comprised a series of tables, forming the Statistical Returns of the
Police of Manchester in the year 1844, with the observations of Mr. Willis, Chief
Constable. The total number of apprehensions from the Ist of January to the 31st
of December 1844 has amounted to 10,702, being a considerable decrease in the
number apprehended, as compared with previous years, and exhibiting much fewer
apprehensions during the past year than during any year since the establishment of

a day and night police force. The decrease may be, in some measure, attributed to
the more prosperous state of trade, which, as compared with previous years, has ex-
isted during the period to which the present returns relate. At the same time, as it
is a fact well-known to the police, that there is always a large class of persons who
never work, and another class who (although employed, and in the receipt of good

wages) are in the habit of committing, or attempting to commit, felonies after their
hours of labour, there can be no doubt that the decrease in the number of apprehen-
sions is not to be altogether attributed to the state of trade, but must be partly
ascribed to the increased efficiency of the police, which has tended in a great measure
to prevent the commission of crime. As respects the summary convictions in the
year 1843, out of 12,147 apprehensions, there were 2981 summary convictions and
758 committals for trial ; wliilst in 1844, out of 10,702 apprehensions, there were
3961 summary convictions and 691 committals for trial; or an actual increase in
the past year of nearly 1000 convictions, although the number of apprehensions has
been less by 1445 individuals. The increase in the number of summary convictions

may, in a measure, be attributed to the pi'ovisions contained in the New Police Act,

which came into operation on the 4th of July 1844, which enables the Justices to
punish by fine or imprisonment parties found drunk in the streets, and which power
has been frequently exercised. The number of apprehensions for drunkenness is

4156 (being 42 less than in the previous year), and from the persons of this class the
sum of 1392/. lOs. lOrf. has been taken and restored when discharged. The return
also shows, that out of a gross amount of 7668Z. 6*. lid. reported to have been stolen
during the year, the sum of 3040/. 14». 3d. has been recovered by the police ; and
that out of a sum amounting to 1801/. 8s. Id. reported to have been accidentally lost,
the police have been instrumental in recovering 1126/. 6s. 3d. The only other
table which it may be necessary to notice is that which shows that during the past
year 2798 premises have been found open and insecure by the police during the
night; of this number, 1433 consisted of warehouses and shops, containing property,
in which no parties resided, or were left in charge j 649 of houses, shops, and ware-
houses, containing property, and in which parties did reside; and 638 of empty
houses. The same table also shows that the police have, during the past year, re-
stored to their friends 2637 children found apparently lost in the streets.

Plan for the Formation of a Society to collect the Statistics of all Civilissed

            On the Statistics of Merthyr Tydvil. By Mr. Kenrick.

   The mass of the population of Merthyr has been brought into this wild district by
the establishment of large ironworks belonging to Messrs. Crawshay, Guest, Hill and

--Thompson. The total population in 1841 was 32,968; houses, 6146 nearly b{

persons to a house, and nearly three persons to a sleeping-room. In consequence of

the number of unmarried men who come from Cardiganshire, Pembrokeshire, and

other adjoining counties, to take advantage of the high wages which are given at the
ironworks, the males much exceed the females ; the former being in the ratio of 6 to 5
of the latter. Though so near the boundary of an English county, there are only
about 4000 English out of a population of 33,000 ; and there are 1 1 ,000, or one-third,
who cannot speak English intelligibly, and would not understand an English sermon.
Only 1313 children attend the day schools, while there are 6857 children who are
of a proper age to receive instruction. Perhaps the number at schools does not ex-
ceed each day 1200 children. Most of the places of worship have Sunday schools
belonging to them, where, to a certain extent, the deficiency of public day schools is
supplied, but the teaching is confined to reading. There is a great neglect of drain-
age in Merthyr : many of the streets are unpaved, and in bad weather the people

have to wade through a stratum of mud from six to twelve inches deep. There
are many cellars and miserable hovels that are not fit for men to dwell in. There
are many streets without the conveniences which are necessary for the health and

comfort of civilized beings. There are no proper infant schools, no good juvenile
schools, two only middling ; most of the teachers being illiterate, two of thenr not
able to write. There is np taste for literature among the working classes, very few
of them having books on general subjects. There is a considerable proportion of
the people who never attend a place of worship, and whose enjoyments are low and
degrading.

                                                                       --

trade of Scotland from the most authentic sources, and also of the quantity of coals

raised in the county of Lanark, and has arranged the information received on these

subjects in two separate tables.

On looking at the table constructed by Mr. Jessop for the iron trade, or for the

iron produced by the blastfurnaces in Scotland for the year ending October 1840,

Dr. Watt finds that the increase in the annual quantity of pig iron smelted in that
country in April 1845, amounts to 374 per cent. And there is every appearance that

before another year expires a proportionate increase will be made in the amount of

iron produced in Scotland.

There are 2,047,000 tons of coal raised annually in Lanarkshire. The following

is the manner in which that quantity is distributed for consumption :

                                                                              Tons.

It is known that the pig and malleable iron works annually consume about 1,000,000

And that families and public works in Glasgow consume not less than           700,000

The quantity of coal shipped at the harbour for the year ending April 1844,

was 120,000

Quantity sent to Greenock by railway is                                         29,000

Quantity sent by canal to the river Clyde                                       70,000
Quantity consumed by steam-vessels carrying passengers and goods on the

Clyde, to and from all quarters, is about                                       64,000

Quantity consumed by the Clyde shipping company's luggage- and tug-boats        10,000

Quantity shipped at Port Eglinton per the Paisley canal                         11,000

Quantity consumed in the country around                                         43,000

                                                                              2,047,000

Facts respecting the Iron Trade. By G, R. Porter, F.R.S.

Sir J. Guest, of Dowlais Works, in evidence before Import Duties Committee,

1840, stated that--

                                                                       Tons.

The iron made at the beginning of this century amounted to... 150,000

In 1806                                                              258,000

In 1823                                                              452,000

In 1825                                                              581,000

In 1828                                                              703,000

In 1835                                                              1,000,000

In 1836                                                              1,200,000

In 1840                                                              1,500,000

Mr. Porter further said, that Mr. Jessop, of the Butterley Works, estimated the

annua! produce in Great Britain, exclusive of Ireland, in 1840, at 1,396,400 tons, and

that the quantity of coal used for smelting that quantity was 4,877,000 tons, besides

2,000,000 tons for converting into wrought iron. To illustrate the importance of
iron steamers, he could state that the Aaron Manby iron steam-boat, built in 1820,

at the Horsley Iron-woiks, has been in use ever since, and the repairs to her hull

Ahave not altogether cost 50/. in those twenty-five years.  small iron steam-boat has

been plying upon the Shannon since 1825. She is still in good condition. The

number of iron steam-boats launched since 1830 is more than 150. The steam navy

--of the East India Company consists, in a great part, of iron 25 now in use in India.

   These were worthy of being investigated ; because, in relation to history, some one

or other of these methods vvas the only means available for interpreting facts. He
enumerated many records of different countries and ages, to show that statistical in-

formation, as a foundation for economic science, had been sought, though errors had
been committed as to the right mode of attainment. There were four different bases

of calculation laid down, on each of which statistical criticism found cause for objec-
tion and correction. 1 . Taking the number of houses, and an average to each house
the fallacy of result from this mode was illustrated by reference to various countries,
at their various stages in the progress of civilization, and by the different habits of
persons in the same district of the same country which affected the average number
of persons in each house. 2. The estimate of population from the records of deaths,

births, and marriages was still more fallacious. Among other illustrations, he men-
tioned his having known of five marriages between six people, with only three chil-

--dren as a result ; and such perturbating influences are frequent. 3. Comparing a

certain part of the population, as, for instance, those capable of bearing arms, an

hitherto applied.

                       MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

On Nasmyth's Steam Hammer for Pile-driving. By Richard Greene, M.D.

Thts machine consists of a steam cylinder, closed at the bottom, but with openings
in the top to allow the passage of air : a piston works in it, having its rod passing
through a steam-tight aperture in the bottom. To this piston-rod the monkey or
driver, which weighs 2J tons, is attached, and is thus suspended. The machine is
worked by high-pressure steam, which, being admitted at the bottom of the cylinder
by the induction-pipe, raises the piston, and with it the monkey attached to it. The
instant it arrives at the height required it closes the induction-pipe, and opening
the eduction-pipe (also at the bottom of the cylinder), the steam escapes, and the
piston with the monkey attached to its rod falis freely upon the head of the pile.

A large heavy cap of iron, with a hole to allow the bead of the pile to pass through,

slides between two upright standards and guides the direction of the pile. The mon-
key and cyhnder also follow the course of the pile, guided by the same uprights, be-
tween which they slide.

  --Dr.' Greene then added, on the authority of the inventor, the following report of the

performance of the machine:
    In the first trial with a part of the machine at the manufactory, it drove a pile

fourteen inches square and eighteen feet in length, fifteen feet into the ground Avith
twenty blows of the monkey, the machine then working seventy strokes a minute
(the ground was a coarse gravel imbedded in a strong tenacious clay), and performed
this work in seventeen seconds. The entire machine is now in full action at Devon-
port for the embankment to be erected there to keep out the sea, and forms an im-
mense wet dock to contain the royal steam navy. The operations required to be
perform^ on each pile from the time it is floated alongside of the stage, until it is
imbedded in the solid foundation of slate-rock, occupy only 4§ minutes. The great
stage which carries the machine, boiler, workmen, and everything necessary, trots
along on its railway like a wheelbarrow. Having driven one pile it moves onward,
the space of the diameter of another ; it picks the pile up out of the water, hoists it
liigh in the air, drops it into its exact place, then covers it with the great iron cap,
which follows it as it sinks into the ground : then thump goes the monkey on its head,
jumping away seventy-five jumps a minute. At the first stroke the pile sunk six feet,
its advance gradually diminishing, until in the hard ground above the solid slate-rock
it was reduced to nine inches.

    Nothing can better prove the superiority of the principle of this invention, of em-
ploying a heavy weight moving with small velocity, instead of a light weight moving
 with great velocity, than the state of the heads of the piles as driven by the two
methods.

    Dr. Greene called attention to a sketch of two heads of piles. One was fifty-six feet
long, driven by a monkey of 12 cwt., falling from a great height, and making only one
 blow in five minutes, and requiring twenty hours to drive it ; this, though protected
                                      ----

by a hoop of iron, was so split and shattered on the head that it would require to be ve-
headed to drive it any further. 'J"he other, although sixty-six feet long, was not even
supported by an iron hoop, and tlie head is as smooth as if it were dressed off with a
new plane. It was driven with a hammer of 50 cwt,, and only three feet fall, making
seventy-five blows a minute, and was put in its place and finished in 4^ minutes.

    In addition to other great advantages of driving by a heavy weight over that of
driving by a light weight, is the immense saving of labour, or whatever moving power

is employed.

   Dr. Greene advocates the use of this new powerful agent in the contemplated har-
bours of refuge which are to be formed along our coasts, and in the recovery of vast
tracts of land from the sea.

   [Since the first communication was received, in consequence of the men becoming
more familiar with the manner of working the machine, some of the huge piles have

actually been raised from the raft, put in their places, and driven to the required
depth in two minutes ; the operation seldom occupying more than four minutes.]

       On Railway Gradients. By William Fairbairn.

The author stated that the object of this communication was simply a notice of ex-

periments then in progress to determine the power of adhesion of the locomotive en-

gine in the first instance, and the force of traction necessary to work gradients in the
second. After a brief statement of the progress made in the development of different

lines of communication and the improvements effected in the locomotive engine, the

paper went on to state the facilities with which even steep gradients were now sur-

mounted by the enlai-ged powers of the engine, more particularly when compared with

those in use at the commencement and subsequent extension of railway traffic.

The author proceeded to examine,

1st. The resistance due to friction on the machinery or working parts of the en-

gine.

2nd. The resistance of the engine considered as a carriage.

.Ird. The resistance of the waggons, carriages, &c. composing a train ; and,

Lastly, the resistance of the air.

    In treating of these separate heads, the writer instanced the experiments of the
Comte de Pambour, Dr. Lardner, and Mr. Woods. According to those authorities,

the resistances were variously stated ; first by Pambour, who makes the friction of

the waggons and steam-engine, when considered as a carriage, equal to 5-76 lbs. per

ton, and for the friction of the working parts of the engine 7 lbs. per ton. On this
7=assumption the resistance would be 5-76 -|-
                                               12-76, or about 13 lbs. per ton for

the sum of the friction due to the engine (considered as a carriage) on the one hand,

and the whole of its constituent parts taken collectively on the other.
   As respects the resistance of the air, the author gave results from similar experi-

ments, and having assumed a velocity of 33 miles an hour, he found a mean resist-

ance of 2'92, or nearly 3 lbs. on every square foot of surface exposed to the action of
the air. Mr. Woods in some recent experiments makes the resistance on a calm day

(at the same velocity) -^-^th of the whole weight, which, compared with others, gives

a total resistance (including friction) of 25 lbs. per ton. This sum was considered a
fair average of the experiments ; and assuming 25 lbs. as the maximum resistance to

every ton of a railway train, the author laid before the Section a table of gradients, of

which the following is an abstract :

--94 REPORT 1845.

    In addition to the resistances, force of traction, &c. already described, the author
briefly detailed several experiments made on the Hunts Bank Incline with two loco-
motive engines belonging to the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company. Both
engines had 14-inch cylinders, and 4 feet 8 inches driving-wheels. The first, with all
the six wheels coupled, took a gross load of 82 tons 2 cwt. up a gradient of 1 in 60 for
a distance of 1144 yards, and 1 in 46 for a distance of about 900 yards; and the
whole distance of 2054 yards was accomplished in 6 minutes.

   By the second engine, with only four wheels coupled, the same load was carried
and the same distance performed in 3 minutes and 30 seconds, being at the rate of

nearly 12 miles an hour.
    From these experiments, and others which are still in progress, it is inferred that a

great saving may be effected in the first outlay and construction of railways ; and in-
stead of spending large sums in tunnels, cuttings and embankments (in order to attain
easy gradients), it will ensure much greater oeconomy, and prove more conducive to

the public interests, leaving out of the question the merits of the atmospheric principle,
to increase the powers of the locomotive engine, and work lines with gradients vary-

ing from 1 in 100 to 1 in 30.

On a new Method of converting Rectilinear into Rotatory Motion. By the

   Rev. James Booth, LL.D., F.R.S., M.R.I. A., Vice-Principal of, and

Professor of Mathematics in the Liverpool Collegiate Institution.

The geometrical property on which this motion is founded is one long known and

of great simplicity. Let a right line of constant length move so as to have its extre-

mities always in contact with two fixed lines at right angles to each other, the middle

point of this constant right line will describe a circle. The author then institutes a
comparison between this method, which he terms the sliding crank, and the common

crank, as applied to the direct action engine, and shows that in the latter, if ce be the

distance from the bottom of the cylinder through which the piston has ascended,

while the shaft has been revolving through the angle d, la and c being the length of

the stroke and of the connecting-rod respectively, we shall have the equation,

the connecting-rod, indefinitely great ; hence it follows that the motion of the sliding-

crank is identical with that of a common crank, whose connecting-rod moves parallel

Heto itself, the most perfect theoretical form of the latter.                 then discusses the fric-

tion on the slides, and proceeds to show that, when the engine is producing its maxi-

mum dynamical effect, the friction is insensible, and concludes by pointing out the ad-

vantages which this method possesses on the ground of compactness, the space occu-

pied by the machinery being very small ; so that, while in the direct action-engine the

distance between the shaft and the top of the cylinder is equal to one-half the stroke

---I- the length of the connecting-rod, in this construction the distance is one-half the

stroke simply, a property of much importance where room is an object of conside-

ration.
