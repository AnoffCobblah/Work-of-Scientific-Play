                      REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Report of the Council for (lie year 1880-81, presented to the General
                   Committee at York, on Wednesday, August 31, 1881.

     The Council have received reports during the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day. In consequence of the omission to appoint
Auditors at the General Committee at Swansea, the accounts for the past
year have been audited by Auditoi's nominated by the Council.

     The Council have nominated the Lord Mayor of York, Lord Houghton,
and the Ven. Archdeacon Creyke to be Vice-Presidents for the Meeting

at York.
     Mr. Sclater informed the Council in December last that he would not

be able to hold the office of General Secretary after the York Meeting.
The Council much regret the loss of Mr. Sclater's valuable services.
They have resolved to recommend that Mr. F. M. Balfour, F.R.S., of

Cambridge, be appointed one of the General Secretaries in the place of
Mr. Sclater.

     Towards the end of last year, the Council took into consideration the
duties and position of the Assistant Secretary, and during the course of
their deliberations Mr. Gordon tendered his resignation of the office.

'The Council, in accepting the resignation, resolved to continue his salary

to the end of the financial year. In making arrangements to fiU up the

appointment, the Council further reconsidered the question of the position
held by the Assistant Secretary. It will be in the recollection of the
'Committee that Mr. Gordon was appointed to a different position from

that held by Professor Phillips and Mr. Griffith. The duties of the office
were somewhat modified, and it was thought that by requiring more
continuous attendance from the Assistant Secretary, it would be possible
to dispense witn the assistance of the clerk. The arrangement did not,
however, answer the intended purpose ; and the Council have resolved to
nominate Professor Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., to fulfil the duties of the office
of Assistant General Secretary, as defined by Professor Phillips in his

memorandum dated May 3, 1861, with the title of Secretary, at a salary

of 300L per annum, with 25?. for travelling expenses.
     The Council have to deplore the loss of Sir Philip de Malpas Grey

Egerton, Bart., F.R.S., who had been a member of the Association since
its commencement, and who held the office of Trustee for many years.
The Council have nominated Mr. Spottiswoode as Trustee, in the place of

Sir Philip Egerton.
      Invitations for 1883 will be presented from Leicester, SoutliDort,

'Oxford, Birmingham, Aberdeen, Nottingham ; and an invitation to
Worcester has been received for 1884.
Ixii                 REPOET 1881.

     The Council announce with great regret the loss that they have
sustained during the past year by the death of Professor Rolleston, F.R.S.
One vacancy having been thus caused in their body, there remain only
four names which it is necessary to remove from the list.

     The Council propose that, in accordance with the regulations, the four
retiring members shall be the following :

      Mr. Easton.                   Prof. Roscoe.

                                                   BT

       SIR JOHN LUBBOCK, Bart., M.P.,

              r.B.S., D.C.L., LL.D., Pres. Linn. Soc,

                             PRESIDENT.

In the name of the British. Association, which for the time I very un-

worthily represent, I beg to tender to you, my Lord Mayor, and through

you to the City of York, our cordial thanks for your hospitable invitation

and hearty welcome.

   We feel, indeed, that in coming to York we are coming home.

Gratefully as we acknowledge and much as we appreciate the kindness

we have experienced elsewhere, and the friendly relations which exist

-- --between this Association and most I might even say, all our great

cities, yet Sir R. Murchison truly observed at the close of our first meet-

ing in 1831, that to York, ' as the cradle of the Association, we shall
ever look back with gratitude ; and whether we meet hereafter on the
banks of the Isis, the Cam, or the Forth, to this spot we shall still fondly
revert.' Indeed, it would have been a matter of much regret to all of us,

if we had not been able on this, our fiftieth anniversary, to hold our

meeting in our mother city.

My Lord Mayor,  before going  farther,  I  must  myexpress  i-egrct,

especially when I call to mind the illustrious men who have preceded me

in this chair, that it has not fallen to one of my eminent friends around

me, to preside on this auspicious occasion. Conscious, howcvei-, as I am

of my own deficiencies, I feel that I must not waste time in dwelling on

them, more especially as in doing so I should but give them greater

prominence. I will, therefore, only make one earnest appeal to your

kind indulgence.

     The connection of the British Association with the City of York does
not depend merely on the fact that our first meeting was held here. It

originated in a letter addressed by Sir D. Brewster to Professor Phillips,

as Secretai-y to your Yoi-k Philosophical Society, by whom the idea

was warmly taken up. Tho first meeting was held on September 26,

1881.                         B
--2 REPORT 1881.

 1831, tlio chair being occnpied by Lord Milton, who delivered an address,
 after wliicli Mr. "William Vernon Harcouvt, Chairman of the Committee

 of Management, submitted to the meeting a code of rules which had
 been so maturely considered, and so wisely framed, that they have re-
 mained substantially the same down to the present day.

      Of those who organised and took part in that first meeting, few, alas !
 remain. Bi-ewster and Phillips, Harcourt and Lord Milton, Lyell and
 Murchison, all have passed away, but their memories live among us.
 Some few, indeed, of those present at our first meeting we rejoice to see
 here to-day, including one of the five members constituting the original

 organising Committee, our venerable Vice-President, Archdeacon Creyke.
      The constitution and objects of the Association were so ably de-

 scribed by Mr. Spottiswoode, at Dublin, and are so well known to you,
that I will not dwell on them this evening. The excellent President of
the Royal Society, in the same address, suggested that the past history
 of the Association would form an appi'opriate theme for the present
meeting. The history of the Association, however, is really the history
of science, and I long shrank from the attempt to give even a pano-
ramic survey of a subject so vast and so difficnlt ; nor should I have
ventured to make any such attempt, but that I knew I could rely on the

assistance of friends in every department of science.

     Certainly, however, this is an opportunity on which it may be well

for us to consider what have been the principal scientific results of the
last half-centnry, dwelling especially on those Avith which this Association

is more directly concerned, either as being the work of our own members,
or as having been made known at our meetings. I have, moreover,

especially taken those discoveries which the Royal Society has deemed
worthy of a medal. It is of course impossible within the limits of a single
address to do more than allude to a few of these, and that very briefly.
In dealing with so large a subject I first hoped that I might take our
annual volumes as a text-book. This, however, I at once found to be
quite impossible. For instance, the first volume commences with a

Report on Astronomy by Sir G. Airy ; I may be pardoned, I trust, for

expressing my pleasure at finding that the second was one by my father,

on the Tides, prepared like the preceding at the request of the Council,
then comes one on Meteorology by Forbes, Radiant Heat by Baden Powell,

Optics by Brewster, Mineralogy by Whewell, and so on. My best course

will therefore be to take our different Sections one by one, and endea-
vour to bring before you a few of the principal results which have been

obtained in each department.

     The Biological Section is that with which I have been most intimately
associated, and with which it is, perhaps, natural that I should begin.

Fifty years ago it was the general opinion that animals and plants

Wecame into existence just as we now see them.  took pleasure in

their beauty ; their adaptation to their habits and mode of life in many
ADDRESS.  3

cases could not be overlooked or misundez'stood. Nevertheless, the book

of Nature was like some richly illuminated missal, written in au unknown
tongue. The graceful forms of the letters, the beauty of the coloring
excited our wonder and admiration ; but of the true meaning little was
known to us ; indeed wo scarcely realised that there was any meaning to

decipher. Now glimpses of the truth are gradually revealing them-

--selves ; we perceive that there is a reason and in many cases we know
--what that reason is for every difference in form, in size, and in color

for every bone and every feather, almost for every hair. Moreover, each
problem which is solved opens out vistas, as it were, of others perhaps

even more interesting. With this important change the name of our illus-

trious countryman, Darwin, is intimately associated, and the year 1859
will always be memorable iu science as having produced his work on
' The Origin of Species.' In the previous year he and Wallace had
published short papers, in which they clearly state the theory of natural
selection, at which they had simultaneously and independently arrived.

We cannot wonder that Darwin's views should have at first excited

great opposition. Nevertheless from the first they met with powerful
support, especially, in this country, from Hooker, Huxley, and Herbert
Spencer. The theory is based on four axioms :

     ' 1. That no two animals or plants iu nature are identical in all

respects.

     ' 2. That the offspring tend to inherit the peculiarities of their

parents.

     ' 3. That of those which come into existence, only a small number

reach maturity.
     * 4. That those, which are, on the whole, best adapted to the circum-

stances in which they are placed, are most likely to leave descendants.'
     Darwin commenced his work by discussing the causes and extent

of vai'iability in animals, and the origin of domestic varieties ; he showed
the impossibility of distinguishing between varieties and species, and

pointed out the wide differences which man has produced in some cases

as, for instance, in our domestic pigeons, all unquestionably descended

from a common stock. He dwelt on the struggle for existence (since

become a household word), which, inevitably resulting in the survival of
the fittest, tends gradually to adapt any race of animals to the conditions
in which it occurs.

     While thus, however, showing the great importance of natural
selection, he attributed to it no exclusive influence, but fully admitted that

-- --other causes the use and disuse of organs, sexual selection, &c. had to

be taken into consideration. Passing on to the difficulties of his theory he
accounted for the absence of intermediate varieties between species, to a
great extent, by the imperfection of the geological record. Here, however, I

must observe that, as I have elsewhere remarked, those who rely on the

absence of links between different species really argue in a vicious circle,
because wherever such links do exist they regard the whole chain as a

                                                 B2
--4 REPORT 1881.

                                  «·

single species. The dog and jackal, for instance, are now regarded as

two sjjecies, bat if a sei'ies of links were discovered between tliem they

would be united into one. Hence in tbia sense there never can be links

between any two species, because as soon as the links are discovered the

species are united. Every variable species consists, in fact, of a number

of closely connected links.

     But if the geological record be imperfect, it is still very instructive.

The further paleeontology has progressed, the more it has tended to fill

up the gaps between existing groups and species : Avhile the careful

study of living forms has brought into prominence the variations

dependent on food, climate, habitat, and other conditions, and shown

that manj- species long supposed to be absolutely distinct are so closely

linked together by intermediate forms that it is difBcult to di'aw a

satisfactory line between them. Thus the European and American bisons

are  connected  by the  Bison                        priscus of  Prehistoric                                     Europe                                      the  grizzly
                                                                                                                                                          ;

bear and the brown bear, as Busk has shown, are apparently the

modern representatives of the cave bear ; Flower has pointed out the

pala;outological evidence of gradual modification of animal forms in the

Artiodactyles ; and we may almost say, as a general rule, that the earliest
known mammalia belong to less specialised types than our existing species.

They are not well-marked Carnivores, Rodents, Marsupials, &c., but rather

constitute a gi'oup of generalised forms from which our j^i'esent well-

marked orders appear to have diverged. Among the Invertebrata, Car-

penter and Williamson have proved that it is almost impossible to divide

the Foraminifera into well-marked species; and, lastly, among plants,

there are large genera, as, for instance, Rubus and Hicracium, with

reference to the species of which no two botanists are agreed.

     The principles of classification point also in the same direction,

and are based more and more on the theory of descent. Biologists en-

deavour to arrange animals on what is called the ' natural system.' No

one now places whales among fish, bats among birds, or shrews with mice,

notwithstanding  their  external                     similarity                                             and  Darwin  maintained                               that
                                                                                                         ;

' community of descent was the hidden bond which naturalists had been

Howunconsciously seeking.'                           else, indeed, can we explain the fact that

the framework of bones is so similar in the arm of a man, the wing

--of a bat, the fore-leg of a horse, and the fin of a porpoise that the

neck of a giraffe and that of an elephant contain the same number of ver-

tebrse ?

     Strong evidence is, moreover, afforded by embryology ; by the presence

of rudimentary organs and transient characters, as, for instance, the

existence in the calf of certain teeth which never cut the gums, the

shrivelled and useless wings of some beetles, the presence of a series of

arteries in the embryos of the higher Vertebrata exactly similar to thos6

which supply the gills in fishes, even the spots on the young blackbird,

the  stripes on the lion's  cub                      these, and innumerable other facts of                                                                        the

was specially and independently created; and to prove, on the conLuiy,
that the embryonic stages of species show us more or less clearly the

structure of their ancestors.

    Darwin's views, however, are still much misunderstood. I believe

there are thousands who consider that according to his theory a sheep
mio'ht turn into a cow, or a zebra into a horse. No one would more

confidently withstand any such hypothesis, his view benig, of course, not

that the one could be changed into the other, but that both are descended

from a common ancestor.
    No one, at any rate, will question the immense impulse which Darwin

has given to the study of natural history, the number of new views

he has opened np, and the additional interest which he has aroused in,

and contributed to, Biology. When we were young we knew that the
leopard had spots, the tiger was sti-iped, and the lion tawny ; but why

this was so it did not occur to us to ask ; and if we had asked no one

would have answered. Now we see at a glance that the stripes of the

tiger have reference to its life among jungle-grasses ; the lion is sandy,

like the desert; while the markings of the leopard resemble spots of
sunshine glancing through the leaves. Again, Wallace in his charming

essays on natural selection has shown how the same philosophy may be

applied even to birds' nests-- how, for instance, open nests have led to the

dull  color  of  hen birds                                                       the only British exception being the kingfisher,
                                                                              ;

which, as we know, nests in river-banks. Lower still, among insects,

Weismann has taught us that even the markings of caterpillars are full of
interesting lessons ; while, 'in other cases, specially among butterfliei?,
Bates has made known to us the curious phenomena of mimicry.

The science of embryology may almost be said to have been created in

the last half-century. Fifty years ago it was a very general opinion that
animals which are unlike when mature, were dissimilar from the begin-

ning. It is to Von Baer, the discoverer of the mammalian ovum, that we

owe the great generalisation that the development of the egg is in the

main a progress from the general to the special, that zoological affinity is

the expression of similarity of development, and that the different great

types of animal structure are the result of different modes of develop-

--ment in fact, that embryology is the key to the laws of animal develop-

ment.

    Thus the young of existing species resemble in many cases the mature
forms which flourished in ancient times. Huxley has traced np the

genealogy of the horse to the Miocene Anchitherium, and his views have

since been remarkably confirmed by Marsh's discovery of the Pliohippus,

Protohippus, Miohipims, and Mesohippus, leading down from the Eohippua

of the early tertiary strata. In the same way Boyd-Dawkins has called

attention to the fact that just as the individual stag gradually acquires more

and more complex antlers : having at first only a single prong, in the next

year  two    points,  in  the                                                    following  three, and so  on                   so  the                                            genus,  as  a

Miocene, tliree ; and that it is not till the Uppei- Pliocene that we find

any species with the magnificent antlers of our modern deer. It seems
to be now generally admitted that birds have come down to ns through

the Dinosaurians, and, as Huxley as shown, the profound break once

supposed to exist between birds and reptiles has been bridged over by

the  discovery                                                             of  reptilian  birds  and   bird-like  reptiles                                     so  that, in fact,
                                                                                                                                                            ;

birds are modified reptiles. Again, the remarkable genus Peripatus,

so well studied by Moseley, tends to connect the annulose and articulate

types.

     Again, the structural resemblances between Amphioxus and the Asci-

dians had been pointed out by Goodsir ; and Kowalevsky in 18GG
showed that these were not mere analogies, but indicated a real

affinity. These observations, in the words of Allen Thomson, ' have pro-

duced a change little short of revolutionary in embryological and zoolo-

gical views, leading as they do to the support of the hypothesis that the

Ascidian is an earlier stage in the phylogenetic history of the mammal

and other vertebrates.'

     The larval forms which occur in so many groups, and of which the

Insects afford us the most familiar examples, are, in the words of

Quatrefages, embryos, which lead an independent life. In such cases as

these external conditions act upon the larvas as they do upon the mature

form                          hence  we                                        have  two  classes  of  changes, adaptational or adaptive,
                           ;

and developmental. These and many other facts must be taken into

consideration                                                              nevertheless naturalists are now generally agreed that em-
                                                                        ;

bryological characters are of high value as guides in classification, and

it may, I think, be regarded as well-established that, just as the con-
tents and sequence of rocks teach us the past history of the earth, so is

the gradual development of the species indicated by the structure of the
embryo and its developmental changes.

    When the supporters of Darwin are told that his theory is in-
credible, they may fairly ask why it is impossible that a species in the

course of hundreds of thousands of years should have passed through

changes "which occupy only a few days or weeks in the life-history of

each individual ?

     The phenomena of yolk-segmentation, first observed by Prevost and
Dumas, are now known to be, in some form or other, invariably the pre-

cursors of embryonic development ; while they reproduce, as the first

stages in the formation of the higher animals, the main and essential

features in the life-history of the lowest forms. The 'blastoderm,' as

it is called, or first germ of the embryo in the egg, divides itself into

two layers, corresponding, as Huxley has shown, to the two layers into

which the body of the Ccelenterata may be divided. Not only so, but

most embryos at an early stage of development have the form of a cup,

the walls of which are formed by the two layers of the blastoderm.

Kowalevsky was the first to show the prevalence of this embryonic

form, and subsequently Laukester and Hasckel put forward the hypo-
                                ADDRESS.

thesis tliat it was the embryonic repetition of an ancestral type, from

which all the higher forms are descended. The cavity of the cup is sup-

posed to be the stomach of this simple organism, and the opening of the

cup the mouth. The inner layer of the wall of the cup constitutes the

digestive membrane, and the outer the skin. To this form Hseckel gave

the name Gastrcea. It is, perhaps, doubtful whether the theory of

Lankester and Ha3ckel can be accepted in precisely the form they pro-

pounded it ; but it has had an important influence on the progress of

embryology. I cannot quit the science of embryology without allud-

ing  to  the  very admirable  work  on ' Comparative                       Embryology                                                             by our

new general secretary, Mr. Balfour, and also the ' Elements of Em-

bryology ' which he had previously published in conjunction with Dr. M.

Foster.

     In 1842, Steenstrup published his celebrated work on the 'Alternation
of Generations,' in which he showed that many species are represented by
two perfectly distinct types or broods, differing in form, structure, and

habits ; that in one of them males are entirely wanting, and that the re-
production is effected by fission, or by buds, which, however, are in some

cases structurally indistinguishable from eggs. Steenstrup's illustrations

were mainly taken from marine or parasitic species, of very great mterest,
but not generally familiar, excepting to naturalists. It has since been

shown that the common Cynips or Gallfly is also a case in point. It had
long been known that in some genera belonging to this group, males are
entirely wanting, and it has now been shown by Bassett, and more

thoroughly by Adler, that some of these species are double-brooded ; the

two broods having been considered as distinct genera.

     Thus an insect known as Neuroterus lenticularis, of which females
only occur, produces the familiar oak-spangles so common on the under

sides of oak-leaves, from which emerge, not Neuroterus lenticularis, but
an insect hitherto considered as a distinct species, belonging even to

a different genus, Spathegaster baccarum. In Spathegaster both sexes
occur ; they produce the currant-like galls found on oaks, and from these

galls Neuroterus is again developed. So also the King Charles oak-

apples produce a species known as Teras terminalis, which descends
to the ground, and makes small galls on the roots of the oak. From these

emerge an insect known as Biorhiza aptera, which again gives rise to the

common oak-apple.

Many butterflies, again, are dimorphic, existing under two, or even

three, distinct forms--one that of the winter, the other of the summer

brood or broods. Weismann has adduced strong reasons for thmkmg

that during the glacial period these species were one-brooded only, and

existed in the  present winter  form                        that, as  the  climate  improved,                                                     the

period of warmth became suflacient to allow the development of a second

brood, and led to the gradual rise of the summer form.

    He and Edwards have shown that, while, by the application of cold,

made to assume the winter dress ; it is, on the contrary, far more difficult

to change the winter into the summer colouring.

   --In some cases as for instance in the very curious Leptodora crystallina

(a fresh-water crustacean, inhabiting deep lakes and reservoirs, and

--which, as its name denotes, is almost perfectly transparent) though the

two forms are almost exactly similar iu their mature state, the mode of

development is very different ; for, while the winter form goes through a
well-marked metamorphosis, in the sammer-brood the development is

direct.

     It might seem that such enquiries as these could hardly have any-

practical bearing. Yet it is not improbable that they may lead to \ery

important results. For instance, it Avould appear that the fluke which pi'o-

duces the rot in sheep, passes one phase of its existence in snails or

slugs, and we are not without hopes that the researches, in which our

lamented friend Prof. Rolleston was engaged at the time of his death,
and which Mr. Thomas is continuing, will lead, if not to the extirpation,
at any rate to the diminution, of a pest from which our farmers have so

grievously suffered.

     It was in the year 1839 that Schwann and Schleiden demonstrated
the intimate relation in which animals and plants stand to each other,
by showing the identity of the laws of development of the elementary
parts in the two kingdoms of organic nature. Analogies indeed had

been previously pointed out, the presence of cellular tissue in certain

parts of animals was known, but Caspar F. Wolff's brilliant memoir had

been nearly  forgotten                                              and  the  tendency  of microscopical  investigation
                                                                 ;

had rather been to encourage the belief that no real similarity existed

that the cellular tissue of animals was essentially different from that of

plants. This had arisen chieflj^, perhaps, because fully formed tissues

were compared, and it was mainly the study of the growth of cells which

led to the demonstration of the general law of development for all or-

ganic elementary tissues.

As regards desci'iptive biology, by far the greater number of species

now recorded have been named and described within the last half-cen-

tury, and it is not too much to say that not a day passes without add-

Aing new species to our lists.                                                comparison, for instance, of the edition

of Cuvier's ' Regno Animal,' published in 1828, as compared with the

present state of our knowledge, is most striking.

     Dr. Giinther has been good enough to make a calculation for me.
The numbers, of course, are only approximate, but it appears that while
the total number of animals described up to 1831 was not more than
70,000, the number now is at least 320,000.

     Lastly, to show how large a field still remains for exploration, I
may add that Mr. Waterhouse assumes that our museums contain not

fewer than 12,000 species of insects which have not yet been described,
while our collections do not probably contain anything like one-half
of those actually in existence. Further than this, the anatomy and habits
even of those which have been described offer an inexhaustible field for
                                  ADDIIKSS.                                                      9

researcli, and it is not going too far to say that there is not a single

species which would not amply repay the devotion of a lifetime.
     One remarkable feature in the modern progress of biological science

has been the application of improved methods of observation and experi-

ment; and the employment in physiological research of the exact mea-
Burements employed by the experimental physicist. Our microscopes

have been greatly improved : achi-omatic object-glasses were introduced

by Lister in 1829 ; the binocular arrangement by Wenham in 185G ; while

immersion lenses, first suggested by Amici, and since carried out under

the formula of Abbe, are most valuable. The use of chemical re-agents

in microscopical investigations has proved most instructive, and another

very important method of investigation has been the power of obtaining

very thin slices by imbedding the object to be examined in paraffin or

some other soft substance. In this manner we can now obtain, say, fifty

separate sections of the egg of a beetle, or the brain of a bee.

At the close of the last century, Sprengel published a most suggestive

work on flowers, in which he pointed out the curious relation existing

between these and insects, and showed that the latter carry the pollen

from flower to flower. His observations, however, attracted little notice

until Darwin called attention to the subject in 1862. It had long

been known that the cowslip and primrose exist under two forms, about

equally numerous, and diSering- from one another in the ari-angements of

their stamens and pistils the one form having the stamens on the summit
                                                                                                                                                      ;

of the flower and the stigma half-way  down                              while in the other the  rela-
                                                                      ;

tive positions are reversed, the stigma being at the summit of the tube

and the stamens half-way down. This difference had, however, been re-

garded as a case of mere variability ; but Darwin showed it to be a
beautiful provision, the result of which is that insects fertilise each flower

with pollen brought from a different plant ; and he proved that flowers

fertilised with pollen from the other form yield more seed than if fer-

tilised with pollen of the same form, even if taken from a diSerent plant.

Attention having been thus directed to the question an astonish-

ing variety of most beautiful contrivances has been observed and de-

scribed by many botanists, especially Hooker, Axel, Delpino, Hildebrand,
Bennett, Fritz Miiller, and above all Hermann Miiller and Darwin
himself. The general result is that to insects, and especially to bees, we
owe the beauty of our gardens, the sweetness of our fields. To their

beneficent, though unconscious action, flowers owe their scent and color,

--their honey nay, in many cases, even their form. Their present shape

and varied arrangements, their brilliant colors, their honey, and their

sweet scent are all due to the selection exercised by insects.
     In these cases the relation between plants and insects is one of mutual

advantage. In many species, however, plants present ns with complex

arrangements adapted to protect them from insects ; such, for instance,

are in many cases  the  resinous  glands which                           render leaves  unpalatable
                                                                                                                                                        ;

being robbed of tlieir honey by ants. Again, more than a century ago,
our countryman, Ellis, described an American plant, Dionaja, in which the
leaves are somewhat concave, with long lateral spines, and a joint in the
middle, which closes up with a jerk, like a rat-trap, the moment any
 unwaiy insect alights on them. The plant, in fact, actually captures and
 devours insects. This observation also remained as an isolated fact until
within the last few years, when Darwin, Hooker, and others have shown

that many other species have curious and very varied contrivances for

supplying themselves with animal food.

     As regards the progress of botany in other directions, Mr. Thiselton
Dyer has been kind enough to assist me in endeavouring to place the

--principal facts before you. Some of the most fascinating branches of botany
    morphology, histology, and physiology scarcely existed before 1830. In

the two former branches the discoveries of von Mohl are pre-eminent. Ho

first obsei'ved cell-division in 1835, and detected the presence of starch

in chlorophyll-corpuscles in 1837, while he first described protoplasm, now

so familiar to us, at least by name, in 184G. In the same year Amici
discovered the existence of the embryonic vesicle in the embryo sac,
which develops into the embryo when fertilised by the entrance of the
pollen-tube into the micropyle. The existence of sexual reproduction
in the lower plants was doubtful, or at least doubted by some eminent
authorities, as recently as 1853, when the actual process of fei'tilisatioii

in the common bladderwrack of our shores was observed by Thuret,
while the I'eproduction of the larger fungi was first worked out by Dc
Bary in 1863.

     As regards lichens', Schwendener proposed, in 1869, the startling
theory, now however accepted by some of the highest authorities, that
lichens are not autonomous organisms, but commensal associations of a

fungus parasitic on an alga. "With reference to the higher Cryptogams it

is hardly too much to say that the whole of our exact knowledge of their

life-history has been obtained during the last half-century. Thus in the
case of ferns the male organs, or antheridia, were first discovered by
Njigeli in 1844, and the archegonia, or female organs, by Suminski in
1848. The early stages in the development of mosses were worked out
by Valentine in 1833. Lastly, the principle of Alternation of Generations
in plants was discovered by Hofmeister. This eminent naturalist also,

in 1851-4, pointed out the homologies of the reproductive processes in

mosses, vascular cryptogams, gymnosperms, and angiosperms.
     Geographical Botany can hardly be said to have had any scientific

status anterior to the publication of the ' Origin of Species.' The way

--had been paved, however, by A. de Candolle and the well-known essay

of Edward Forbes ' On the Distribution of the Plants and Animals

--of the British Isles,' by Sir J. Hooker's introductory essay to the

' Flora of New Zealand,' and by Hooker and Thomson's introductory

essay to the ' Flora Indica.' One result of these researches has been to

give the coujJ-de-grdcG to the theory of an Atlantis. Lastly, in a lecture
ADDRESS.  11

 delivered to the Geographical Society in 1878, Thiselton Dyer himself
 has sammed up the present state of the subject, and contributed an
 important addition to our knowledge of plant- distribution by showing

how its main features may be explained by migration in latitude from

 north to south without recourse being had to a submerged southern conti-

nent for explaining the features common to South Africa, Australia, and

 America.

      The fact that systematic and geographical botany have claimed a
preponderating share of the attention of British phytologists, is no doubt

in great measure due to the ever- expanding area of the British Empire,

and the rich botanical treasures which we are continually receiving from
India and our numerous colonies. The series of Indian and Colonial Floras,
published under the direction of the authorities at Kew, and the ' Genera
Plantarum ' of Bentham and Hooker, are certainly an honor to our
country. To similar causes we may trace the rise and rapid progress of
economic botany, to which the late Sir W. Hooker so greatly contributed.

      In vegetable physiology some of the most striking researches have
been on the effect produced by rays of light of different refrangibility.
Daubeny, Draper, and Sachs have shown that the light of the red end
of the spectrum is more effective than that of the blue, so far as the decom-

position of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) is concerned.
      Nothing could have appeared less likely than that researches into the

theory of spontaneous generation should have led to practical improve-
ments in medical science. Yet such has been the case. Only a few
years ago Bacteria seemed mere scientific curiosities. It had long been

-- --known that an infusion say, of hay would, if exposed to the atmo-

sphere, be found, after a certain time, to teem with living forms. Even
those few who still believe that life would be spontaneously generated
in such an infusion, will admit that these minute organisms are, if not
entirely, yet mainly, derived from germs floating in our atmosphere ; and

if precautions are taken to exclude such germs, as in the careful experi-
ments especially of Pasteur, Tyndall, and Robei'ts, everyone will grant
that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred no such development of life

will take place. In 1836-7 Cagniard de la Tour and Schwann indepen-
dently showed that fermentation was no mere chemical process, but was
due to the presence of a microscopic plant. But, more than this, it has
been gradually established that putrefaction is also the work of micro-

scopic organisms. Thirty years, however, elapsed before these important
discoveries received any practical application.

     At length, however, they have led to most important results in Surgery.

One reason why compound fractures are so dangerous is because, the skin

being broken, the air obtains access to the wound, bringing with it
innumerable germs, which too often set up putrefying action. Lister

first made a practical application of these observations. He set himself

to find some substance capable of killing the germs without being itself
too potent a caustic, and he found that dilute carbolic acid fulfilled these
12 REPORT 1881.

conditions. This discovery has enabled many operations to be performed

which would previously have been almost hopeless.

The same idea seems destined to prove as useful in Medicine as

in Surgery. There is great reason to suppose that many diseases,

especially those of a zymotic character, have their origin in the germs

Weof special organisms.  know that fevers run a certain definite course.

The parasitic organisms are at first few, but gradually multiply at the

expense of the patient, and then die out again. Indeed, it seems to

be thoroughly established that mauy diseases are due to the exces-

sive multiplication of microscopic organisms, and wc are not without hope

that means will be discovered by which, without injury to the patient,

these terrible, though minute, enemies may be destroyed, and the disease

thus stayed. Bacillus anthracis, for instance, is now known to be the

cause of splenic fever, which is so fatal to cattle, and is also communi-

cable to man. At Bradford, for instance, it is only too well known as

the woolsorter's disease. If, however, matter containing the Bacillus

be treated in a particular manner, and cattle be then inoculated with it,

they are found to acquire an immunity from the fever. The interesting

researches of Burdon Sanderson, Greenfield, Koch, Pasteur, Toussaint,

and others, seem to justify the hope that we may be able to modify

these and other germs, and then by appropriate inoculation to protect

ourselves against fever and other acute diseases.

Terrier's researches, in continuation of those of Fritsch and Hitzigr,

have enabled us to localize the function of various parts of the brain. His

results have not only proved of great importance in surgery, and in many

cases led to successful operations, by pointing out the exact source of the

mischief, but an exact knowledge of the brain is also of the greatest

importance in the ti-eatment of nervous diseases. Echeverria has col-

lected 165 cases of traumatic epilepsy, of which 64 per cetit. were cured
by removing a portion of the skull, the site for the operation and the exact

nature of the lesion being indicated by cerebral localization.

     The history of Antesthetics is a most remarkable illustration how long
we may be on the very verge of a most important discovery. Ether,
which, as we all know, produces perfect insensibility to pain, was

discovered as long ago as 1540. The ancesthetic property of nitrous
oxide, now so extensively used, was observed in 1800 by Sir H. Davy,
who actually experimented on himself, and had one of his teeth painlessly

extracted when under its influence. He even suggests that ' as nitrous

oxide gas seems capable of destroying pain, it could probably be used
with advantage in surgical operations.' Nay, this property of nitrous
oxide was habitually explained and illustrated in the chemical lectures

given in hospitals, and yet for fifty years the gas was never used in

actual operations. No one did more to promote the use of anoesthetics

than Sir James Y. Simpson, who introduced chloroform, a substance

which was discovered in 1831, and which for a while almost entirely

superseded ether and nitrons oxide, thoagli, with improved methods of

administration, the latter are now coming into favour again.
    The only other reference to Physiology which time permits me to

make, is the great discovery of the reflex action, as it is called, of the
nervous centres. Reflex actions had been long ago observed, and it had

been shown by Whytt and Hales that they were more or less independent
of volition. But the general opinion was that these movements indicated
some feeble power of sensation independently of the brain, and it was

not till the year 1832 that the ' reflex action ' of certain nervous centres

was made known to us by Marshall Hall, and almost at the same period
by Johannes Miiller.

    Few branches of science have made more rapid progress in the last

half-century than that which deals with the ancient condition of Man.

When our Association was founded it was generally considered that the

human race suddenly appeared on the scene, about 6,000 years ago, after
the disappearance of the extinct mammalia, and when Europe, both as
regards physical conditions and the other animals by which it was in-
habited, was pretty much in the same state as in the period covered
by Greek and Roman history. Since then the persevering researches of
Layard, Rawlinson, Botta and others have made known to us, not only

the statues and palaces of the ancient Assyrian monarchs, but even their

libraries ; the cuneiform characters have been deciphered, and we can not
only see, but read, in the British Museum, the actual contemporary re-

cords, on burnt clay cylinders, of the events recorded in the historical
books of the Old Testament and in the pages of Herodotus. The re-
searches in Egypt also seem to have satisfactorily established the fact
that the pyramids themselves are at least 6,000 years old, while it is ob-
vious that the Assyrian and Egyptian monarchies cannot suddenly have
attained to the wealth and power, the state of social organisation, and

progress in the arts, of which we have before us, preserved by the sand

of the desert from the ravages of man, such wonderful proofs.
     In Europe, the writings of the earliest historians and poets indicated

that, before iron came into general use, there was a time when bronze was

the ordinary material of weapons, axes, and other cutting implements,
and though it seemed a priori improbable that a compound of copper and
tin should have preceded the simple metal iron, nevertheless the researches
of archaeologists have shown that there really was in Europe a ' Bronze

Age,' which at the dawn of history was just giving way to that of ' Iron.'
    The contents of ancient graves, buried in many cases so that their

owner might carry some at least of his wealth with him to the world of
spirits, have proved very instructive. More especially the results obtained
by Nilsson in Scandinavia, by Hoare and Borlase, Bateman, Greenwell,
and Pitt-Rivers, in our own country, and the contents of the rich cemetery
at Hallstadt, left no room for doubt as to the existence of a Bronze Age

but we get a completer idea of the condition of Man at this period from

the Swiss lake-villages, first made known to us by Keller, and subsequently

studied by Morlot, Troyon, Dcsor, Riitimeyer, Heer, and other Swiss

archiBologists. Along the shallow edges of the Swiss lakes there flourished,

once upon a time, many populous villages or towns, built on platforms

supported by piles, exactly as many Malayan villages are now. Under

these circumstances innumerable objects were one by one dropped into

the water ; sometimes whole villages were burnt, and their contents

submerged ; and thus we have been able to recover, from the waters of

oblivion in which they had rested for more than 2,000 years, not only the

arms and tools of this ancient people, the bones of their animals, their

pottery and ornaments, but the stuffs they wore, the grain they had

stored up for future use, even fruits and cakes of bread.

But this bronze-using people were not the earliest occupants of

Europe. The contents of ancient tombs give evidence of a time when metal

was unknown. This also was confirmed by the evidence then unexpectedly

received from the Swiss lakes.* By the side of the bronze-age villages

were others, not less extensive, in which, while implements of stone

and bone were discovered literally by thousands, not a trace of metal was

met with. The shell-mounds or refuse-heaps accumulated by the ancient

fishermen along the shores of Denmark, and carefully examined by

Steenstrup, Worsaae, and other Danish naturalists, fally confirmed the

existence of a ' Stone Age.'

   We have still much to learn, I need hardly say, about this Stone-age

people, but it is surprising how much has been made out. Evans truly

observes, in his admirable work on ' Ancient Stone Implements,' ' that so

far as external appliances are concerned, they are almost as fully repre-

sented as would be those of any existing savage nation by the researches

Weof a painstaking traveller.'  have their axes, adzes, chisels, borers,

scrapers, and various other tools, and we know how they made and how

they used them ; we have their personal ornaments and implements of
war ; we have their cooking utensils ; we know what they ate and what
they wore ; lastly, we know their mode of sepulture and funeral customs.

They hunted the deer and horse, the bison and urns, the bear and the

wolf, but the reindeer had already retreated to the North.

No bones of the reindeer, no fragment of any of the extinct mammalia,

have been found in any of the Swiss lake- villages or in any of the thousands

of tumuli which have been opened in our own country or in Central and

Southern Europe. Yet the contents of caves and of river-gravels afford

abundant evidence that there was a time when the mammoth and rhinoceros,

the musk-ox and reindeer, the cave lion and hyena, the great bear and the

gigantic Irish elk wandered in our woods and valleys, and the hippopo-

tamus floated in our rivers ; when England and France were united, and
the Thames and the Rhine had a common estuary. This was long sup-
posed to be before the advent of man. At length, however, the dis-
coveries of Boucher de Perthes in the valley of the Somme, supported as
they are by the researches of many continental naturalists, and in our

own country of MacEnery and Godwin-Austen, Prestwich and Lyell,

Vivian and Pcngclly, Christy, Evans and many more, have proved that

man formed a humble part of this strange assembly.

     Nay, even at this early period there were at least two distinct races

--of men in Europe ; one of them as Boyd Dawkins has pointed out

closely resembling the modern Esquimaux in form, in his weapons and

implements, probably in his clothing, as well as in so many of the

animals with which he was associated.

At this stage Man appears to have been ignorant of pottery, to have

had no knowledge of agriculture, no domestic animals, except perhaps

the dog.   His weapons were the axe, the spear, and the javelin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I do not

believe he knew the use of the bow, though he was probably acquainted

with the lance. He was, of course, ignorant of metal, and his stone

implements, though skilfully formed, were of quite different shapes from

those of the second Stone age, and were never ground. This earlier Stone

period, when man co-existed with these extinct mammalia, is known as

the Palfeolithic, or Early Stone Age, in opposition to the Neolithic, or

Newer Stone Age.

The remains of the mammalia which co-existed with man in pre-

historic times have been most carefully studied by Owen, Lartet, Riiti-

meyer. Falconer, Busk, Boyd-Dawkins, and others. The presence of the

mammoth, the reindeer, and especially of the musk-ox, indicates a severe,

--not to say an arctic, climate the existence of which, moreover, was

proved by other considerations ; while, on the contrary, the hippopotamus

Howrequires considerable warmth.        then is this association to be ex-

plained ?

While the climate of the globe is, no doubt, much affected by geo-

graphical conditions, the cold of the glacial period was, I believe, mainly

due to the greater excentricity of the earth's orbit combined with the

effects of precession of the ecliptic. The result of the latter condition

is a period of 21,000 years, during one half of which the northern hemi-
sphere is warmer than the southern, while during the other 10,500 years

the reverse is the case. At present we are in the former phase, and there
is, we know, a vast accumulation of ice at the south pole. But when the

earth's orbit is nearly circular, as it is at present, the difference between

the two hemispheres is not very great; while, on the contrary, as the

excentricity of the orbit increases, the contrast between them increases

also. This excentricity is continually oscillating within certain limits,

which Croll and subsequently Stone have calculated for the last million

years. At present the excentricity is -OIG and the mean tempera-

ture of the coldest month in London is about 40°. Such has been the

state  of things  for  nearly  100,000  years                             but  before  that  there                                                                                                                                                                                                      was  a

period, beginning 300,000 years ago, when the excentricity of the orbit

varied from -26 to -57. The result of this would be greatly to increase

the effect due to the obliquity of the orbit ; at certain periods the climate

would be much warmer than at present, while at others the number of

days in winter would be twenty more, and of summer twenty less, than

now, -while the mean temperature of the coldest month would be lowered

We20°.   thus get something like a date for the last glacial epoch, and

we sec that it was not simply a period of cold, but rather one of ex-
tremes, each beat of the pendulum of temperature lasting for no less than
21,000 years. This explains the fact that, as Morlot showed in 1854,
the glacial deposits of Switzerland, and, as we now know, those of Scot-

land, are not a single uniform layer, but a succession of strata indicating

very different conditions. I agree also with CroU and Geikie in thinking

that these considerations explain the apparent anomaly of the co-existence

in  the  same  gravels  of  arctic  and  tropical  animals                                       the former  having

lived in the cold, while the latter flourished in the hot, periods.

    It is, I think, now well established that man inhabited Europe during

the milder periods of the glacial epoch. Some high authorities indeed

consider that we have evidence of his presence in pre-glacial and even

in Miocene times, but I confess that I am not satisfied on this point.

Even the more recent period carries back the record of man's existence

to a distance so great as altogether to change our views of ancient

history.

    Nor is it only as regards the antiquity and material condition of man

in prehistoric times that great jjrogress has been made. If time
permitted I should have been glad to have dwelt on the origin and

development of language, of custom, and of law. On all of these the

comparison of the varioias lower races still inhabiting so large a portion

of tlie earth'.s sm^face, has thrown much light ; while even in the most
cultivated nations we find survivals, curious fancies, and lingering ideas

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the fossil remains as it were of former customs and religions, embedded
in our modern civilisation, like the relics of extinct animals in the crust

of the earth.

      In geology the formation of our Association coincided with the appear-
ance of Lyell's ' Principles of Geology,' the first volume of which was

published in 1830 and the second in 1832.. At that time the received
opinion was that the phenomena of Geology could only be explained
by violent periodical convulsions, and a high intensity of terrestrial
energy culminating in repeated catastrophes. Hutton and Playfair had
indeed maintained that such causes as those now in operation, would, if
only time enough were allowed, account for the geological structure of

the earth ; nevertheless the opposite view generally prevailed, until Lyell,
with rare sagacity and great eloquence, with a wealth of illustration

and most powerful reasoning, convinced geologists that the forces now

in action are powerful enough, if only time be given, to produce result.^
quite as stupendous as those which Science records.

     As regards stratigraphical geology, at the time of the first meeting of

the British Association at York, the strata between the carboniferous lime-
stone and the chalk had been mainly reduced to order and classified, chiefly
through the labours of William Smith. But the classification of all the

strata lying above the chalk and below the carboniferous limestone re-
spectively, remained in a state of the greatest confusion. The year 1831
marks the period of the commencement of the joint labours of Sedgwick

and Murchisou, which resulted in the establishment of the Cambrian,
Silurian, and Devonian systems. Our Pre- Cambrian strata have recently
been divided by Hicks into four great groups of immense thickness,
and implying a great lapse of time ; but no fossils have yet been

discovered in them. Lyell's classification of the Tertiary deposits : the
result of the studies which he carried on with the assistance of Deshayes

and others, was published in the third volume of the ' Principles of

Geology' in 1833. The establishment of Lyell's divisions of Eocene,

Miocene, and Pliocene, was the starting-point of a most important series

of  investigations by Prestwich     and  others of these younger deposits                                                                                                                                                 as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

well as of the post-tertiary, quaternary, or drift beds, which are of special

interest from the light they have thrown on the early history of man.

    A full and admirable account of what has recently been accomplished

in this department of science, especially as regards the palasozoic rocks,

will be found in Etheridge's late address to the Geological Society.

    The thickness of the sedimentary strata implies an enormous lapse of

time, but the amount of subsequent destruction which has taken place is
scai'cely less surprising. Ramsay, for instance, has shown that in Wales

from 9,000 to 11,000 feet of solid rock have been removed from largo

tracts of country. Faults or cracks there esteud for miles, with the strata

on one side raised in some cases as much as 10,000 feet above the same

strata on the other, and yet there is not on the sui'face the slightest

vestige of this gigantic dislocation.

     The long lines of escarpment again, which stretch for miles across our
country, and were long supposed to be ancient coast lines, are now ascer-

tained, mainly through the researches of Whitaker, to be due to the dif-

ferential action of aerial causes.

    Before 1831 the only geological maps of this country were William

Smith's general and county maps, published between the years 1815 and

1821!. In the year 1832 De la Beche made proposals to the Board of
Ordnance to color the ordnance-maps geologically, and a sum of 300Z. was

granted for the purpose. Out of this small beginning grew the important

work of the Geological Survey.

    The cause of slaty cleavage had long been one of the great difhculties

of geology. Sedgwick suggested that it was produced by the action of
ci'ystalline or polar forces. According to this view miles and miles of
country, comprising great mountain masses, were neither more nor less

than parts of a gigantic crystal. Sharpe, however, called attention tu
the fact that shells and other fossils contained in slate rocks are com-

pressed in a direction at right angles to the planes of cleavage, as if the

rocks had been seized in the jaws of a gigantic vice. Sorby first maintained

that the cleavage itself was due to pressure. He observed slate rocks con-

taining small plates of mica, and that the effect of pressure would tend to

    1881.                                c
--18 BEPOET 1881,

arrange these plates with their flat surfaces perpendicular to the direction

of the pressure. Tyndall has since shown that the presence of flat flakes

is not necessary. He proved by experiment that pure wax could be made

by pressure to split into plates of great tenuity, which he attributes mainly
to the lateral sliding of the particles of the was over each other ; and
thus the result of pressure on such a mass is to develop a fissile structure
similar to that produced in wax on a small scale, or on a great one in
the slate rocks of Cumberland or Wales.

     The difficult problem of the conditions under which granite and cer-
tain other rocks were formed was attacked by Sorby with great skill
in a paper read before the Geological Society in 1858. The microscopic
hollows in many minei-als contain a liquid which does not entirely fill the
hollow, but leaves a small vacuum ; and Sorby ingeniously pointed out
that the rock must have solidified at least at a temperature high enough
to expand the liquid so as to fill the cavity. Sorby's important memoir
laid the foundation of microscopic petrogi-aphy, which is now not only
one of the most promising branches of geological research, but which has
been successfully applied by Sorby himself, and by Maskelyne, to the study

of meteorites.

     As regards the physical character of the earth, two theories have been
held : one, that of a fluid interior covered by a thin crust ; the other, of
a practically solid sphere. The former is now generally considered by
physicists to be untenable. Though there is still much difference of
opinion, the prevailing feeling on the subject has been expressed by
Professor Le Conte, who says, ' the whole theory of igneous agencies--

--which is little less than the whole foundation of theoretic geology must

be reconstructed on the basis of a solid earth.'
     In 1837 Agassiz startled the scientific world by his ' Discours sur

I'ancienne extension des Glaciers,' in which, developing the observation

already made by Charpentier and Venetz, that boulders had been transported
to great distances, and that rocks far away from, or high above, existing
glaciers, are pohshed and scratched by the action of ice, he boldly asserted
the existence of a 'glacial period,' during which Switzerland and the
North of Europe were subjected to great cold and buried under a vast

sheet of ice.

     The ancient poets described certain gifted mortals as privileged to
descend into the interior of the earth, and have exercised their imagi-
nation in recounting the wonders there revealed. As in other cases,
however, the realities of science have proved more varied and surprising
than the dreams of fiction. Of the gigantic and extraordinary animals
thus revealed to us by far the greatest number have been described during
the period now under review. For instance, the gigantic Cetiosaurus

was described by Owen in 18.38, the Dinornis of New Zealand by the

same distinguished naturalist in 1839, the Mylodon in the same year,
and the Archosopteryx in 1862.

     lu America, a large number of remarkable forms have been described,

mainly by Marsh, Leidy, and Cope. Marsh has made known to us the

Titanosaurus, of the American (Colorado) Jurassic beds, which is,

perhaps, the largest land animal yet known, being a hundred feet in

length, and at least thirty in height, though it seems possible that even

these vast dimensions were exceeded by those of the Atlantosaurus. Nor

must I omit the Hesperornis, described by Marsh in 1872, as a carnivorous,

swimming ostrich, provided with teeth, which he regards as a character

inherited from reptilian ancestors ; the Ichthyornis, stranger still, with

biconcave vertebraj, like those of fishes, and teeth set in sockets ; while

in the Eocene deposits of the Rocky Mountains the same indefatigable

palaeontologist, among other very interesting remains, has discovered

three new groups of remarkable mammals, the Dinocerata, Tillodontia,

and Brontotheridaj. He has also described a number of small, but very

interesting Jurassic mammalia, closely related to those found in our

Stonesfield Slate and Purbeck beds, for which he has proposed a new

order, * Prototheria.' Lastly, I may mention the curiously anomalous

Reptilia from South Africa, which have been made known to us by

Professor Owen,

Another important result of recent pateontological research is the

law of brain-growth. It is not only in the higher mammalia that

we find forms with brains much larger than any existing, say, in Miocene

--times. The rule is almost general that as Marsh has briefly stated it

We'all tertiary mammals had small brains.'                                                                                                                                           may even carry the

generalisation further. The cretaceous birds had brains one-third smaller

than those of our own day, and the brain-cavities of the Dinosauria of

the Jurassic period are much smaller than in any existing reptiles.

As giving, in a few words, an idea of the rapid progress in this de-

partment, I may mention that Morris's ' Catalogue of British Fossils,'

published in 1843, contained 5,300 species; while that now in pre-

paration by Mr. Etheridge enumerates 15,000.

But if these figures show how rapid our recent progress has been,

they also very forcibly illustrate the imperfection of the geological

record, giving us, I will not say a measure, but an idea, of the im-

perfection of the geological record. The number of all the described

recent species is over 300,000, but certainly not half are yet on our lists,

and we may safely take the total number of recent species as being not

less than 700,000. But in former times thei'e have been at the very least

twelve periods, in each of which by far the greater number of species

were distinct. True, the number of species was probably not so large in

the earlier periods as at present ; but if we make a liberal allowance for
this, we shall have a total of more than 2,000,000 species, of which about

25,000 only are as yet upon record                                                                                                                                                   and many of these are only represented
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

by a few, some only by a single specimen, or even only by a fragment.

The progress of palaeontology may also be marked by the extent to

which the existence of groups has been, if I may so say, carried back in

time. Thus I believe that in 1830 the earliest known quadrupeds were

London Clay, the oldest now known is the Archseopteryx of the Solen-

on the Triassic rocks are those of birds. So again the Amphibia have

been carried back from the Trias to the Coal-measures ; Fish from the

Old Red Sandstone to the Upper Silurian ; Reptiles to the Trias; Insects

from the Cretaceous to the Devonian ; Mollusca and Crastacea from the

Silurian to the Lower Cambrian. The rocks below tbe Cambrian, though

of immense thickness, have afforded no relics of animal life, if we except

the problematical Eozoon Canadense, so ably studied by Dawson and

Carpenter. But if palaeontology as yet throws no light on the original

forms of life, we must remember that the simplest and the lowest organ-

isms are so soft and perishable that they would leave ' not a wrack

behind.' I will not, however, enlarge on this branch of science, because

we shall have the advantage on Friday of hearing it treated with the

skill of a master.

    Passing to the Science of Geography, Mr. Clements Markham has re-

cently published an excellent summai-y of what has been accomplished

during the half- century.

     As regards the Arctic regions, in the year 1830 the coast line of Arctic
America was only very partially known, the region between Barrow Strait
and the continent, for instance, being quite unexplored, while the eastern
sides of Greenland and Spitzbergen, and the coasts of Nova Zembla,

were almost unknown. Now the whole coast of Arctic America has been

delineated, the remarkable archipelago to the north has been explored,

--and no less than seven north-west passages none of them, however,

--unfortunately of any practical value have been traced. The north-

eastern passage, on the other hand, so far at least as the mouths of the

great Siberian rivers, may perhaps hereafter prove of commercial im-
portance. In the Antarctic regions, Enderby and Graham Lands were
discovered in 1831-2, Balleny Islands and Sabrina Land in 1839, while

the fact of the existence of the great southern continent was established in

1841 by Sir James Ross, who penetrated in 1842 to 78° 11', the southern-

most point ever reached.
     In Asia, to quote from Mr. Markham, ' our officers have mapped the

whole of Persia and Afghanistan, surveyed Mesopotamia, and explored
the Pamir steppe. Japan, Borneo, Siam, the Malay peninsula, and
the greater part of China have been brought more completely to our
knowledge. Eastern Turkestan has been visited, and trained native ex-
plorers have penetrated to the remotest fountains of the Oxus, and the
wild plateaux of Tibet. Over the northern half of the Asiatic Continent
the Russians have displayed great activity. They have traversed the wild
steppes and deserts of what on old atlases was called Independent Tartary,
                                    ADDBES8.                                                           21

Lave surveyed the courses of the Jaxartes, the Oxus, and the Amur, and
have navigated the Caspian and the Sea of Aral. They have pushed their

scientific investigations into the Pamir and Eastern Turkestan, until at

last the British and Russian surveys have been connected.*

     Again, fifty years ago the vast central regions of Africa were almost

a blank upon our best maps. The rudely drawn lakes and rivers in maps

of a more ancient date had become discredited. They did not agree
among themselves, the evidence upon which they were laid down could

not be found, they were in many respects highly improbable, and they

seemed inconsistent with what had then been ascertained concerning the

Niger and the Blue and White Nilos. At the date of which I speak,

the Sahara had been crossed by English travellers from the shores of

the Mediterranean ; but the southern desert still formed a bar to travellers

from the Cape, while the accounts of traders and others who alone had

entered the country from the eastern and western coasts were considered

to form an insufficient basis for a map.

     Since that time the successful crossing of the Kalahari desert

to Lake Ngami has been the prelude to an era of African discovery.

Livingstone explored the basin of the Zambesi, and discovered vast

lakes and waters which have proved to be those of the higher

Congo. Burton and Speke opened the way from the West Coast, which
Speke and Grant pursued into and down the Nile, and Stanley down

the  course  of  the  middle  and   lower  Congo                             and the  vast  extension  of
                                                                          ;

Egyptian dominion has brought a huge slice of equatorial Africa within

the limits of semi- civilisation. The western side of Africa has been
attacked at many points. Alexander and Galton were among the first to

make known to us its western tropical regions immediately to the north

of the Cape Colony ; the Ogowe has been explored ; the Congo promises

to become a centre of trade, and the navigable portions of the Niger, the

Gambia, and the Senegal are familiarly known.

     The progress of discovery in Australia has been as remarkable as

that in Africa. The interior of this great continent was absolutely
unknown to us fifty years ago, but is now crossed through its

centre by the electric telegraph, and no inconsiderable portion of it is

turned into sheep-farms. It is an interesting fact that General Sabine,

so long one of our most active officers, and who is still with us,

though, unfortunately, his health has for some time prevented hinx

from attending our meetings, was born on the very day that the

first settler landed in Australia.

     In hydrography onr charts have been immensely improved. The study

of rivers and of the physical geography of the sea may indeed almost

be said to have come into existence as a science during the last fifty
years, and in the words of Jansen, it was Maury 'who, by his wind and

current charts, his trade-wind, storm, and rain charts, and last, but not

least, by his work on the physical geography of the sea, gave the first

great impnlse to all subsequent researches,'
22 EEPORT-- 1881.

But the progress in our knowledge of geography is, and has been, by

DO means confined to the improvement of our maps, or to the discovery

and description of new regions of the earth ; bat has extended to the causes

which have led to the present configuration of the surface. To a great

extent indeed this part of the subject falls rather within the scope of

geology, but I may here refer, in illust'-ation, to the distribution of lakes,

the phenomena of glaciers, the formation of volcanic mountains, and the

structure and distribution of coral islands.

The origin and distribution of lakes is one of the most interesting

problems in physical geography. That they are not scattered at random,

a glance at the map is sufficient to show. They abound in mountain
districts, are comparatively rare in equatorial regions, increasing in num-

ber as we go north, so that in Scotland and the northern parts of

America they are sown broadcast.

Perhaps a priori the first explanation of the origin of lakes which

would suggest itself, would be that they were formed in hollows resulting

from a disturbance of the strata, which had thrown them into a basin-

ehaped form. Lake-basins, however, of this character are, as a matter

of fact, very rare as a general rule lakes have not the form of basin-
                                                                                                           ;

shaped synclinal hollows, but, on the contrary, the strike of the strata

Myoften runs right across them.   eminent predecessor. Professor

--Ramsay, divides lakes into three classes: (1) Those which are due to

irregular accumulations of drift, and which are generally quite shallow.

(2) Those which are formed by moraines, and (3) those which occupy
true basins scooped by glacier-ice out of the solid rock. To the latter

class belong, in his opinion, most of the great Swiss and Italian lakes.

Professor Ramsay attributes their excavation to glaciers, because it is of

course obvious that rivers cannot make basin-shaped hollows sun'ounded

by rock on all sides. Now the Lake of Geneva, 1,230 feet above the

sea, is 984 feet deep, the Lake of Brienz is 1,850 feet above the sea, and

2,000 feet deep, so that its bottom is really below the sea-level. The

Italian lakes are even more remarkable. The Lake of Como, 700 feet

above the sea, is 1,929 feet deep. Lago Maggiore, G85 feet above the

sea, is no less than 2,625 feet deep. It will be observed that these lakes,

--like many others in mountain regions those of Scandinavia, for instance
--lie in the direct channels of the great old glaciers. If the mind is at

first staggered at the magnitude of the scale, we must remember that the

ice which scooped out the valley in which the Lake of Geneva 'now re-

poses, was once at least 2,700 feet thick ; while the moraines were also
of gigantic magnitude, that of Ivrea, for instance, being no less than 1,500

feet in height. Professor Ramsay's theory seems, therefore, to account

beautifully for a large number of interesting facts.

The problem is, however, very complex ; and, while admitting the

force of Professor Ramsay's arguments, there are, no doubt, other causes

which have exercised a considerable influence in the arrangement and

configuration of lakes ; for instance-- as has been ably argued by our
                              ADDRESS.                                23

--new secretary, Professor Bonney irregular movements of nplieaval along

lines athwart tlie valleys.

Passing from lakes to mountains, two rival theories with reference to

the structure and origin of volcanoes long struggled for supremacy.

     The more general view was that the sheets of lava and scorise

--which form volcanic cones such, for instance, as ^tna or Vesuvius

were originally nearly horizontal, and that subsequently a force operating

from below, and exerting a pressure both upwards and outwards from a

central axis towards all points of the compass, ujDlifted the whole stratified

mass and made it assume a conical form, giving rise at the same time, in

many cases, to a wide and deep circular opening at the top of the cone,

called by the advocates of this hypothesis a ' crater of elevation.'

This theory, though, as it seems to us now, it had already received its

death-blow from the admirable memoirs of Scrope, was yet that most

generally adopted fifty years ago, because it was considered that com-

pact and crystalline lavas could not have consolidated on a slope

exceeding 1° or 2°. In 1858, however. Sir C. Lyell conclusively showed

that in fact such lavas could consolidate at a considerable angle, even

in some cases at more than 30°, and it is now generally admitted that

though the beds of lava, &c., may have sustained a slight angular

elevation since their deposition, still in the main, volcanic cones have

acquired their form by the accumulation of lava and ashes ejected

from one or more craters.

The problems presented by glaciers are of very great interest. In

1843 Agassiz and Forbes proved that the centre of a glacier, like

that of a river, moves more rapidly than its sides. But how and why do

glaciers move at all ? Rendu, afterwards Bishop of Anne§y, in 1841

endeavoured to explain the facts by supposing that glacier ice enjoys a

kind of ductility. The 'viscous theory' of glaciers was also adopted,

and most ably advocated, by Forbes, who compared the condition of a

glacier to that of the contents of a tar barrel poured into a sloping

Wechannel.  have all, however, seen long narrow fissures, a mere fraction
--of an inch in width, stretching far across glaciers a condition incom-

patible with the ordinary idea of viscosity. The phenomenon of regelation

was afterwards applied to the explanation of glacier-motion. An obser-

vation of Faraday's supplied the clue. He noticed in 1850 that when

two pieces of thawing ice are placed together they unite by freezing at

the place of contact. Following up this suggestion Tyndall found that

if he compressed a block of ice in a mould it could be made to assume

Aany shape he pleased.       straight prism, for instance, placed in a groove

and submitted to hydraulic pressure, was bent into a transparent semi-

circle of ice. These experiments seem to have proved that a glacial

valley is a mould through which the ice is forced, and to which it will

accommodate itself, while, as Tyndall and Huxley also pointed out, the

' veined structure of ice ' is produced by pressure, in the same manner as

the cleavage of slate rocks.
24 REPORT-- 1881.

     It was in the year 1842 that Darwin published his great work on
' Coral Islands.' The fringing reefs of coral presented no special difBcnlty.
They could be obviously accounted for by an elevation of the land, so
that the coral which had originally grown under water, had been raised
above the sea-level. The circular or oval shape of so many reefs, how-
ever, each having a lagoon in the centre, closely surrounded by a deep
ocean, and I'isiug but a few feet above the sea-level, had long been a
puzzle to the physical geogi'apher. The favourite theory was that these
were the summits of submarine volcanoes on which the coral had grown.
But as the reef-making coral does not live at greater depths than about
twenty-five fathoms, the immense number of these reefs formed an almost
insuperable objection to this theory. The Laccadives and Maldives, for

--instance meaning literally the 'lac of islands ' and the 'tliousand islands'
-- are a series of such atolls, and it was impossible to imagine so great a

number of craters, all so nearly of the same altitude. Darwin showed,

moreover, that so far from the ring of coi'als resting on a corresponding

ridge of rock, the lagoons, on the contrary, now occupy the place which

was once the highest land. He pointed out that some lagoons, as for

instance, that of Vanikoro, contain an island in the middle ; while other

islands, such as Tahiti, are surrounded by a margin of smooth water,

separated from the ocean by a coral reef. Now, if we suppose that

Tahiti were to sink slowly, it would gradually approximate to the con-

dition of Vanikoro                                                                                      and  if  Vanikoro  gradually sank, the  central  island
                                                                                                     ;

would disappear, while on the contrary the gi-owth of the coral might

neutralise the subsidence of the reef, so that we should have simply an

atoll, with its lagoon. The same considerations explain the origin of the

' barrier reefs,' such as that which runs, for nearly one thousand miles,
along tlie north-east coast of Australia. Thus Darwin's theory ex-
plained the form and the approximate identity of altitude of these coral
islands. But it did more than this, because it showed us that there
were great areas in process of subsidence, which, though slow, was of
great importance in physical geography.'

     Much information has also been acquired with reference to the

abysses of the ocean, especially from the voyages of the Porcupine and the
Challenger. The greatest depth yet recorded is near the Ladrone Islands,
where a sounding of 4,575 fathoms was obtained.

    Ehrenberg long ago pointed out the similarity of the calcareous mud
now accumulating in our recent seas to the chalk, and showed that the

green sands of the geologist are largely made up of casts of foraminifera.
Clay, however, had been looked on, until the recent expeditions, as
essentially a product of the disintegration of older rocks. Not only,
however, are a large proportion of siliceous and calcareous rocks either
directly or indirectly derived from material which has once formed a
portion of living organisms, but Sir Wyville Thomson maintains that

     ' I ought to mention that Darwin's views have recently been questioned \>j

this is the case with some clays also. In that case the striking remark
of Linnaeus, that ' fossils are not the children but the parents of rocks,'
will have received remarkable confirmation. I should have thought it,
I confess, probable that these clays are, to a considerable extent, com-

posed of volcanic dust.
     It would appear that calcareous deposits resembling our chalk do not

occur at a greater depth than 3,000 fathoms ; they have not been met with
in the abysses of the ocean. Here the bottom consists of exceedingly fine
clay, sometimes coloured red by oxide of iron, sometimes chocolate by

manganese oxide, and containing with Foraminifera occasionally large

numbers of siliceous Radiolaria. These strata seem to accumulate with
extreme slowness : this is inferred from the comparative abundance of
whales' bones and fishes' teeth ; and from the presence of minute spherical

--particles, supposed hy Mr. Murray to be of cosmic origin in fact, to be

the dust of meteorites, which in the course of ages have fallen on the

ocean. Such particles no doubt occur over the whole surface of the

earth, but on land they soon oxidise, and in shallow water they are covered

up by other deposits. Another interesting result of recent deep-sea

explorations has been to show that the depths of the ocean are no mere

barren solitudes, as was until recent years confidently believed, but, on

Wethe contrary, present us many remarkable forms of life.                                                                  have, how-

ever, as yet but thrown here and there a ray of light down into the

ocean abysses :

In Astronomy, the discovery in 1845 of the planet Neptune, made

independently and almost simultaneously by Adams and by Le Verrier,

was certainly one of the very greatest triumphs of mathematical genius.

Of the minor planets four only were known in 1831, whilst the number

now on the roll amounts to 220. Many astronomers believe in the

existence of an intra-mercurial planet or planets, but this is still an

open question. The Solar System has also been enriched by the dis-

covery of an inner ring to Saturn, of satellites to Mars, and of additional

satellites to Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The most unexpected progress, however, in our astronomical know-

ledge during the past half-century has been due to spectrum analysis.

The dark lines in the spectrum were first seen byWollaston, who noticed

a few of them                                                                  but  they  were  independently discovered by Fraunhofer,
                                                                            ;

after whom they are justly named, and who, in 1814, mapped no fewer

than 576. The first steps in ' spectrum analysis,' properly so called, were

made by Sir J. Herschel, Fox Talbot, and by Wheatstone, in a paper read

before this Association in 1835. The latter showed that the spectrum

emitted by the incandescent vapour of metals was formed of bright lines,

and that these lines, while, as he then supposed, constant for each metal,

Wediffered for different metals. '                                                              have here,' he said, a' mode of dis-

criminating metallic bodies more readily than that of chemical examination,

and which may hereafter be employed for useful purposes.' Nay, not
only can bodies thus be more readily discriminated, but, as we now

know, the presence of extremely minute portions can be detected, the

·gT^ ooooo o^ ^ grain being in some cases easily perceptible.
    It is also easy to see that the presence of any new simple sub-

stance might be detected, and in this manner already several new elements

have been discovered, as I shall mention when we come to Chemistry.

But spectrum analysis has led to even grander and more unexpected

triumphs. Fraunhofer himself noticed the coincidence between the

Ddouble dark line of the solar spectrum and a double line which he

observed in the spectra of ordinary flames, while Stokes pointed out

to Sir W. Thomson, who taught it in his lectures, that in both cases

these lines were due to the presence of sodium. To Kirchhoff and

Bunsen, however, is due the independent conception and the credit of

having first systematically investigated the relation which exists between

Fraunhofer's lines and the bright lines in the spectra of incandescent

metals. In order to get some fixed measure by which they might

determine and record the lines characterising any given substance, it

occurred to them that they might use for comparison the spectrum of

the sun. They accordingly arranged their spectroscope so that one-half

of the slit was lighted by the sun, and the other by the luminous gases

they proposed to examine. It immediately struck them that the bright

--lines in the one corresponded with the dark lines in the other the

Dbright line of sodium, for instance, with the line or rather lines in

the sun's spectrum. The conclusion was obvious. There was sodium

in the sun. It must indeed have been a glorious moment when that

thought flashed across them, and even by itself well worth all their

labour.

    But why is the bright line of a sodium flame represented by a black

one in the spectrum of the sun ? To Angstrom is due the theory that a

vapour or gas can absorb luminous rays of the same refrangibility only

which it emits when highly heated ; while Balfour Stewart independently

discovered the same law with reference to radiant heat.

This is the basis of Kirchhoff's theory of the origin of Fraunhofer's

lines. In the atmosphere of the sun the vapours of various metals are

present, each of which would give its characteristic lines, but within

this atmospheric envelope is the still more intensely heated nucleus

of the sun, which emits a brilliant continuous spectrum, containing rays

Whenof all degi-ees of refrangibility.  the light of this intensely heated

nucleus is transmitted through the surrounding atmosphere, the bright

lines which would be produced by this atmosphere are seen as dark

ones.

Kirchhoff and Bunsen thus proved the existence in the sun of hydro-

gen, sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, nickel, chromium, manganese,

titanium, and cobalt ; since which Angstrom, Thalen, and Lockyer have

considerably increased the list.
ADDRESS.  27

     But it is not merely the chemistry of the heavenly bodies on which
light is thrown by the specti'oscope ; their physical structure and evolu-
tional history are also illuminated by this wonderful instrument of

research.

     It used to be supposed that the sun was a dark body enveloped in

a luminous atmosphere. The reverse now appears to be the truth. The

body of the sun, or photosphere, is intensely brilliant ; round it lies the
solar atmosphere of comparatively cool gases, which cause the dark lines

--in the spectrum; thirdly, a chromosphere, a sphere principally of

hydrogen, jets of which are said sometimes to reach to a height of
100,000 miles or more, into the outer coating or corona, the nature of
which is still very doubtful.

     Formerly the red flames which represent the higher regions of the
chromosphere could be seen only on the rare occasions of a total solar
eclipse. Janssen and Lockyer, by the application of the spectroscope,
have enabled us to study this region of the sun at all times.

      It is, moreover, obvious that the powerful engine of investigation

afiForded us by the spectroscope is by no means confined to the substances
which form part of our system. The incandescent body can thus be
examined, no matter how great its distance, so long only as the light is
strong enough. That this method was theoretically applicable to the
light of the stars was indeed obvious, but the practical difficulties were
very great. Sirius, the brightest of all, is, in round numbers, a
hundred millions of millions of miles from us ; and, though as big as sixty
of our suns, his light when it reaches us, after a journey of sixteen
years, is at most one two-thousand-millionth part as bright. Nevertheless
as long ago as 1815 Fraunhofer recognised the fixed lines in the light
of four of the stars, and in 1863 Miller and Huggins in our own
country, and Rutherford in America, succeeded in determining the dark
lines in the spectrum of some of the brighter stars, thus showing that

these beautiful and mysterious lights contain many of the material
substances with which we are familiar. In Aldebaran, for instance, we
may infer the presence of hydrogen, sodium, magnesium, iron, calcium,

tellurium, antimony, bismuth, and mercury ; some of which are not yet
known to occur in the sun. As might have been expected the composi-

tion of the stars is not uniform, and it would appear that they may

be arranged in a few well-marked classes, indicating difierences of

temperature or, in other words, of age. Some recent photographic spectra
of stars obtained by Huggins go very far to justify this view.

    Thus we can make the stars teach us their own composition with

--light which started from its source before we were born light older

than our Association itself.

     Until 1864, the true nature of the unresolved nebulae was a matter of
doubt. In that year, however, Huggins turned his spectroscope on to
a nebula, and made the unexpected discovery that the spectra of some

--of these bodies are discontinuous that is to say, consist of bright lines
28 BEPORT-- 1881.

only, indicating that ' in place of an incandescent Bolid or liquid body

we must probably regard these objects, or at least their photo-surfaces,

as enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour. For it is from matter

in a gaseous state only that such light as that of the nebulae is known
to be emitted.' So far as observation has yet gone, nebulte may be

divided into two classes : some giving a continuous spectrum, others one

consisting of bright lines. These latter all appear to give essentially the

same spectrum, consisting of a few bright lines. Two of them, in Mr.

Huggins' opinion, indicate the presence of hydrogen : one of them agrees

in position with a line characteristic of nitrogen.

But spectrum analysis has even more than this to tell us. The old

methods of observation could determine the movements of the stars so

far only as they were transverse to us ; they afforded no means of

measuring motion either directly towards or away from us. Now

Doppler suggested in 1841 that the colors of the stars would assist us

in tins respect, because they would be affected by their motion to and

from the earth, just as a steam- whistle is raised or lowered as it ap-

proaches or recedes from us. Everyone has observed that if a train

whistles as it passes us, the sound appears to alter at the moment the

engine goes by. This arises, of course, not from any change in the

whistle itself, but because the number of vibrations whicb reach the ear

in a given time are increased by the speed of the train as it ap-

proaches, and diminished as it recedes. So, like the sound, the color

would be affected by such a movement ; but Doppler's method was prac-

tically inapplicable, not only because the amount of effect on the color

would be hardly sensible, but also for other reasons ; indeed, as we did
not know the true color of the stars, we had no datum line by which to

measure.

   A cliange of refrangibility of light, bow'ever, does occur in conse-

quence of relative motion, and Huggins successfully applied the spectro-

scope to solve the problem. He took in the first place the spectroscope

of Sirius, and chose a line known as F, which is due to hydrogen. Now, if

Sirius was motionless, or rather if it retained a constant distance from the

earth, the line F would occupy exactly the same position in the spectrum

of Sirius as in that of the sun. On the contrary, if Sirius were ap-

proaching or receding from us, this line would be slightly shifted either

towards the blue or red end of the spectrum. He found that the line

had moved very slightly towards the red, indicating that the distance

between us and Sirius is increasing at the rate of about twenty miles a

second. So also Betelgeux, Rigel, Castor, and Regulus are increasing

their  distance                                   while,  on  the  contrary, that of  others,  as for  instance of
                                               ;

Vega, Arcturus, and Pollux, is diminishing. The results obtained by

Huggins on about twenty stars have since been confirmed and extended

by Mr. Christie, now Astronomer Royal, in succession to Sir G. Airy, who

has long occupied the post with so much honour to himself and advantage

to science,
                                                                            ADDRESS.         29

To examine the spectrum of a shooting star would seem even more

difficult. Alexander Herschel first succeeded in doing so, and determined

the presence of sodium ; since which Von Konkoly has recognised the

lines of magnesium, carbon, potassium, lithium and other substances, and

it appears that the shooting stars are bodies similar in character and com-

position to the stony masses which sometimes reach the earth as aerolites.

Some light has also been thrown upon those mysterious visitants, the

comets. The researches of Prof. Newton on the periods of meteoroids led

to the remarkable discovery by Schiaparelli of the identity of the orbits

of some meteor-swarms with those of some comets. The similarity' of

orbits is too striking to be the result of chance, and shows a true cos-

mical relation between the bodies. Comets, in fact, are in some cases at

any rate groups of meteoric stones. From the spectra of the small comets

of 1866 and 1868, Huggins showed that part of their light is emitted by

Athemselves, and reveals the presence of carbon in some form.                                photo-

graphic spectrum of the comet recently visible, obtained by the same

observer, is considered by him to prove that nitrogen, probably in com-

bination with carbon, is also present.

    No element has yet been found in any meteorite, which was not
previously known as existing in the earth, but the phenomena which they

exhibit indicate that they must have been formed under conditions very

different from those which prevail on the earth's surface. I may mention,

for instance, the peculiar form of crystallised silica, called by Maskelyne,

Asmanite                                               and the whole class  of  meteorites,  consisting of iron generally
                                                    ;

alloyed with nickel, which Daubree terms Holosiderites. The interesting

discovery, however, by Nordenskiold, in 1870, at Ovifak, of a number of

blocks of iron alloyed with nickel and cobalt, in connection with basalts

containing disseminated iron, has, in the words of Judd, ' afforded a very

important link, placing the terrestrial and exti'a-terrestrial rocks in closer

relations with one another.'

   We have as yet no sufficient evidence to justify a conclusion as to

whether any substances exist in the heavenly bodies which do not occur

in our earth, though there are many lines which cannot yet be satisfac-

torily referred to any terrestrial element. On the other hand, some

substances which occur on our earth have not yet been detected in the

sun's atmosphere.

     Such discoveries as these seemed, not long ago, entirely beyond
our hopes. M. Comte, indeed, in his ' Cours de Philosophie Posi-

tive,' as recently as 1842, laid it down as an axiom regarding the

heavenly bodies, that ' Nous concevons la possibilite de determiner leurs

formes, leurs distances, leurs grandeurs et leurs mouvements, tandis que

nous ne saurions jamais etudier par aucun moyen leur composition

chimique ou leur structure mineralogique.' Yet within a few years

this supposed impossibility has been actually accomplished, showing how

unsafe it is to limit the possibilities of science.

It is hardly necessary to point out that, while the spectrum has taught
--30 REPORT 1881.

US so mucla, we have still even more to learn. Why should some

Whysubstances give few, and others many, lines ?  should the same

substance give different lines at different temperatures ? What are

the relations between the lines and the physical or chemical pro-

perties ?

   We may certainly look for much new knowledge of the hidden actions

of atoms and molecules from future researches with the spectroscope. It

may even, perhaps, teach us to modify our views of the so-called simple

substances. Prout, long ago, struck by the remarkable fact that nearly

all atomic weights are simple multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen,
suggested that hydrogen must be the primordial substance. Brodie's
researches also naturally fell in with the supposition that the so-called
simple substances are in reality complex, and that their constituents occar
separately in the hottest regions of the solar atmosphere. Lockyer con-
siders that his researches lend great probability to this view. The whole

subject is one of intense interest, and we may rejoice that it is occupying
the attention, not only of such men as Abney, Dewar, Hartley, Liveing,
Eoscoe and Schuster in our own country, but also of many foreign

observers.

    When geology so greatly extended our ideas of past time, the con-

tinned heat of the sun became a question of greater interest than ever.

Helmholtz has shown that, while adopting the nebular hypothesis, we
need not assume that the nebulous matter was originally incandescent
but that its present high temperature may be, and probably is, mainly

due to gravitation between its parts. It follows that the potential energy
of the sun is far from exhausted, and that with continued shrinking it
will continue to give out light and heat, with little, if any, diminution for

several millions of years.

Like the sand of the sea, the stars of heaven have ever been used as

effective symbols of number, and the improvements in our methods of

Weobservation have added fresh force to our original impressions.  now

know that our earth is but a fraction of one out of at least 75,000,000

worlds.

    But this is not all. In addition to the luminous heavenly bodies, we

cannot doubt that there are countless others, invisible to us from their

greater distance, smaller size, or feebler light ; indeed we know that
there are many dark bodies which now emit no light or comparatively
little. Thus in the case of Procyon, the existence of an invisible body
is proved by the movement of the visible star. Again I may refer to the
curious phenomena presented by Algol, a bright star in the head of

Medusa. This star shines without change for two days and thirteen
hours ; then, in three hours and a half, dwindles from a star of the
second to one of the fourth magnitude ; and then, in another three and
a half hours, reassumes its original brilliancy. These changes seem
certainly to indicate the presence of an opaque body, which intercepts at

regular intervals a part of the light emitted by Algol,
                                                      ADDRESS.                                       31

Thus the floor of heaven is not only ' thick inlaid with patines of

bright gold,' but studded also with extinct stars; once probably as brilliant

as our own sun, but now dead and cold, as Helmholtz tells us that our sun

itself will be, some seventeen millions of years hence.

The connection of Astronomy with the history of our planet has been

a subject of speculation and research during a great part of the half-

century of our existence. Sir Charles Lyell devoted some of the opening

chapters of his great work to the subject. Haughton has brought his

very original powers to bear on the subject of secular changes in climate,

and CroU's contributions to the same subject are of great interest. Last,

but not least, I must not omit to make mention of the series of massive

memoirs (I am happy to say not yet nearly terminated) by George Dar-

win on tidal friction, and the influence of tidal action on the evolution of

the solar system.

    I may perhaps just mention, as regards telescopes, that the largest
reflector in 1830 was Sir W. Herschel's of 4 ft., the largest at present

being Lord Rosse's of 6 ft. ; as regards refractors the largest then had a
diameter of 11|^ in., while your fellow-townsman Cooke carried the size

to 25 in., and Mr. Grubb, of Dublin, has just successfully completed

one of 27 in. for the Observatory of Vienna. It is remarkable that the

two largest telescopes in the world should both be Irish.

  --The general result of astronomical researches has been thus eloquently

summed up by Proctor : ' The sidereal system is altogether more

complicated and more varied in structure than has hitherto been

supposed ; in the same region of the stellar depths co-exist stars of many

orders of real magnitude ; all orders of nebulte, gaseous or stellar,

planetary, ring-formed, elliptical, and spiral, exist within the limits of the

galaxy                                   and lastly,  the whole system  is  alive  with  movements,  the laws
                                      ;

of which may one day be recognised, though at present they appear too

complex to be understood.'

   We can, I think, scarcely claim the establishment of the undu-

latory theory of light as falling within the last fifty years ; for
though Brewster, in his ' Report on Optics,' published in our first volume,
treats the question as open, and expresses himself still unconvinced,
he was, I believe, almost alone in his preference for the emission theory.

The phenomena of interference, in fact, left hardly any--if any

room for doubt, and the subject was finally set at rest by Foucault's
celebrated experiments in 1850. According to the undulatory theory
the velocity of light ought to be greater in air than in water, while if
the emission theory were correct the reverse would be the case. The

-- --velocity of light 186,000 miles in a second is, however, so great that,

to determine its rate in air, as compared with that in water, might
seem almost hopeless. The velocity in air was, nevertheless, determined
by Fizeau in 1849, by means of a rapidly revolving wheel. In the
following year Foucault, by means of a revolving mirror, demonstrated
--32 REPORT 1881.

--that the velocity of light is greater ia air than in water thus completing

the evidence in favonr of the undnlatory theory of light.

     The idea is now gaining ground, that, as maintained by

Clerk-Maxwell, light itself is an electro-magnetic disturbance, the
luminiferous ether being the vehicle of both light and electricity.

      Wiiusch, as long ago as 1792, had clearly shown that the three
 primary colors were red, green, and violet ; but his results attracted little
notice, and the general view used to be that there were seven prin-

--cipal colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet ; four
-- --of which namely orange, green, indigo, and violet were considered

to arise from mixtures of the other three. Red, yellow, and blue were
therefore called the primary colors, and it was supposed that in order
to produce white light these three colors must always be present.

      Helmholtz, however, again showed, in 1852, that a color to our
unaided eyes identical with white, was produced by combining yellow

with indigo. At that time yellow was considered to be a simple color,
and this, therefore, was regarded as an exception to the general rule,

that a combination of three simple colors is required to produce white.
Again, it was, and indeed still is, the general impression that a com-
bination of blue and yellow makes green. This, however, is entirely

a mistake. Of course we all know that yellow paint and blue paint
make green paint ; but this results from absorption of light by the semi-

transparent solid particles of the pigments, and is not a mere mixture of
the colors proceeding unaltei'ed from the yellow and the blue particles :
moreover, as can easily be shown by two sheets of colored paper and a
piece of window glass, blue and yellow light, when combined, do not give
a trace of green, but if pure would produce the effect of white. Green,
therefore, is after all not produced by a mixture of blue and yellow.

On the other hand, Clerk-Maxwell proved in 1860 that yellow could

be produced by a mixture of red and green, which put an end to
the pi'etension of yellow to be considered a primary element of color.

From these and other considerations it would seem, therefore, that the

--three primary colors--if such an expression be retained are red, green,

and violet.
     The existence of rays beyond the violet, though almost invisible to

our eyes, had long been demonstrated by their chemical action. Stokes,
however, showed In 1852 that their existence might be proved in

another manner, for that there are certain substances which, when
excited by them, emit light visible to our eyes. To this phenomenon
he gave the name of fluorescence. At the other end of the spectrum
Abney has recently succeeded in photographing a large number of lines
in the infra-red portion, the existence of which was first proved by Sir

William Herschel.

     From the rarity, and in many cases the entire absence, of refei'ence

--to blue, in ancient literature, Geiger adopting and extending a suggestion

--first thrown out by Mr. Gladstone has maintained that, even as recently
                            ADDRESS.      33

as the time of Homer, our ancestors were blue-bliud. Thougli for my
part I am unable to adopt this view, it is certainly very remarkable that

neither the Rigveda, which consists almost entirely of hymns to heaven,

nor the Zendavesta, the Bible of the Parsees or fire-worshippers, nor

the earlier books of the Old Testament, nor the Homeric poems, ever

allude to the sky as blue.

    On the other hand, from the dawn of poetry, the splendours of the
morning and evening skies have excited the admiration of mankind. As

Ruskin says, in language almost as brilliant as the sky itself, the whole

heaven, ' from the zenith to the horizon, becomes one molten, mantlino- sea
of colour and fire ; every black bar turns into massy gold, eveiy ripple
and wave into unsullied shadowless crimson, and purple, and scarlet, and
colours for which there are no words in language, and no ideas in the

--mind things which can only be conceived while they are visible; the

intense hollow blue of the upper sky melting through it all, showino- here
deep, and pure, and lightness ; there, modulated by the filmy, formless
body of the transparent vapour, till it is lost imperceptibly in its crimson
and gold.'

But what is the explanation of these gorgeous colors ? why is the

sky blue ? and why are the sunrise and sunset crimson and gold ? It

may be said that the air is blue, but if so how can the clouds assume

their varied tints ? Brucke showed that very minute particles suspended

in water are blue by reflected light. Tyndall has taught us that the

blue of the sky is due to the reflection of the blue rays by the minute

Nowparticles floating in the atmosphere.  if from the white light of the

sun the blue rays are thus selected, those which are transmitted will be

yellow, orange, and red. Where the distance is short the transmitted

light will appear yellowish. But as the sun sinks towards the horizon
the atmospheric distance increases, and consequently the number of the
scattering particles. They weaken in succession the violet, the indigo,
the blue, and even disturb the proportions of green. The transmitted
light under such circumstances must pass from yellow throuo-h orano-e
to red, and thas, while Ave at noon are admiring the deep blue of the sky,
the same rays, robbed of their blue, are elsewhere lighting up the evenino-

sky with all the glories of sunset.

Another remarkable triumph of the last half-century has been the

discovery of photography. At the commencement of the century Wedo-.

wood and Davy observed the effect produced by throwing the images of

objects on paper or leather prepared with nitrate of silver, but no means

were known by which such images could be fixed. This was first effected
by Niepce, but his processes were open to objections, which prevented

them from coming into general use, and it was not till 1839 that Daguerre

invented the process which was justly named after him. Very soon a

further improvement was eS'ected by our countryman Talbot. He not

-- --only fixed his ' Talbotypes ' on paper in itself a great convenience but,

positive, or natural, copies from one original picture. This process is the

foundation of all the methods now in use perhaps the greatest improve-
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

ments having been the nse of glass plates, first proposed by Sir John

Herschel ; of collodion, suggested by Le Grey, and practically used by

Archer ; and, more lately, of gelatine, the foundation of the sensitive film

now growing into general use in the ordinary dry-plate process. Not only

have a great variety of other beautiful processes been invented, but the

delicacy of the sensitive film has been immensely increased, with the

advantage, among others, of diminishing greatly the time necessary for

obtaining a picture, so that even an express train going at full speed can

^^now be taken. Indeed, with full sunlight  of a second is enough, and

in photographing the sun itself (jo^oo of a second is sufficient.

   We owe to Wheatstone the conception that the idea of solidity is

derived from the combination of two pictures of the same object in slightly

different perspective. This he proved in 18.33 by drawing two outlines

of some geometrical figure or other simple object, as they would appear

to either eye respectively, and then placing them so that they might be

seen, one by each eye. The ' stereoscope,' thus produced, has been greatly

popularised by photography.

For 2,000 years the art of lighting had made little if any progress.

Until the close of the last century, for instance, our lighthouses contained

mere fires of wood or coal, though the construction had vastly improved.

The Eddystone lighthouse, for instance, was built by Smeaton in 1759
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but for forty years its light consisted of a row of tallow candles stuck

in a hoop. The Argand lamp was the first great improvement, followed

by gas, and in 1863 by the electric light.

Just as light was long supposed to be due to the emission of material

particles, so heat was regarded as a material, though ethereal, substance,

which was added to bodies when their temperature was raised.

Davy's celebrated experiment of melting two pieces of ice by rubbing

them against one another in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump had

convinced him that the cause of heat was the motion of the invisible

particles of bodies, as had been long before suggested by Newton,

Boyle, and Hooke. Rumford and Young also advocated the same view,

Nevertheless, the general opinion, even until the middle of the present

century, was that heat was due to the presence of a subtle fluid known as
' caloric,' a theory which is now entirely abandoned.

Melloni, by the use of the electric pile, vastly increased our knowledge

of the phenomena of radiant heat. His researches were confined to the

solid and liquid forms of matter. Tyndall studied the gases in this respect,

showing that differences greater than those established by Melloni

existed between gases and vapours, both as regards the absorption and

radiation of heat. He proved, moreover, that the aqueous vapour of our

atmosphere, by checking terrestrial radiation, augments the earth's

temperature, and he considers that the existence of tropical vegetation

--the remains of which now constitute onr coal-beds may have been due to
ADDBESS.  35

the heat retained by the vapours which at that period were diffused in
the earth's atmosphere. Indeed, but for the vapour in our atmosphere, a
single night would suffice to destroy the whole vegetation of the temperate

regions.

     Inspired by a contemplation of Graham Bell's ingenious experi-
ments with intermittent beams on solid bodies, Tjmdall took a new
and original departure; and regarding the sounds as due to changes
of temperature he concluded that the same method would prove applic-

able to gases. He thus found himself in possession of a new and

independent method of procedure. It need perhaps be hardly added that,

when submitted to this new test, his former conclusions on the inter-

action of heat and gaseous matter stood their ground.
     The determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat is mainly due

to the researches of Mayer and Joule. Mayer, in 1842, pointed out the
mechanical equivalent of heat as a fundamental datum to be determined
by experiment. Taking the heat produced by the condensation of air as
the equivalent of the work done in compressing the air, he obtained a

numerical value of the mechanical equivalent of heat. There was,

however, in these experiments, one weak point. The matter operated

on did not go through a cycle of changes. He assumed that the

production of heat was the only effect of the work done in com-
pressing the air. Joule had the merit of being the first to meet this

possible source of error. He ascertained that a Aveight of 1 lb. would

have to fall 772 feet in order to raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water by
1° Fahr. Hirn subsequently attacked the problem from the other side, and
showed that if all the heat passing through a steam-engine were turned
into work, for every degree Fahr. added to the temperature of a pound of
water, enough work could be done to raise a weight of 1 lb. to a height of
772 feet. The general result is that, though we cannot create energy
we may help ourselves to any extent from the great storehouse of nature.

Wind and water, the coal-bed and the forest, afford man an inexhaustible

supply of available energy.

     It used to be considered that there was an absolute break between
the different states of matter. The continuity of the gaseous, liquid, and
solid conditions was first demonstrated by Andrews in 1862.

     Oxygen and nitrogen have been liquefied independently and at the
same time by Cailletet and Raoul Pictet. Cailletet also succeeded in
liquefying air, and soon afterwards hydrogen was liquefied by Pictet
under a pressure of 650 atmospheres, and a cold of 170° Cent, below
zero. It even became partly solidified, and he assures us that it fell on
the floor with ' the shrill noise of metallic hail.' Thus then it was shown
experimentally that there are no such things as absolutely permanent gases.

     The kinetic theory of gases, now generally accepted, refers the elasticity
of gases to a motion of translation of their molecules, and we are assured
that in the case of hydrogen at a temperature of 60° Fahr. tbey move

at an average rate of 6,225 feet in a second ; while, as regards their size,

   We cannot, it would seem at present, hope for any increase of our

knowledge of atoms by any improvement in the microscope. With

our present instruments we can perceive lines ruled on glass -^ olo o ^H

of an inch apart. But, owing to the properties of light itself, the

fringes due to interference begin to produce confusion at distances of

^-j.i.^-^th they would make the obscurity more or less complete. If indeed

we could use the blue rays by themselves, their waves being much

shorter, the limit of possible visibility might be extended to jrWji-uv '> ^^^
as Helmholtz has suggested, this perhaps accounts for Stinde having

actually been able to obtain a photographic image of lines only xTTTmrTyt^^
of an inch apart. It would seem then that, owing to the physical

characters of light, we can, as Sorby has pointed out, scarcely hojje

for any great improvement so far as the mere visibility of structure is

concerned, though in other respects no doubt much may be hoped for.

At the same time, Dallinger and Royston Pigott have shown that, so

far as the mere presence of simple objects is concerned, bodies of even

smaller dimensions can be perceived.

According to the views of Helmholtz, the size of the smallest particle

that could be distinctly defined, when associated with others, is about

-g-jj^Tj^th of an inch. Sorby estimates that a particle of albiimen of this size
contains 125 millions of molecules. In the case of such a simple compound

as w.ater the number is 8,000 millions. Even, then, if we could construct

microscopes far more powerful than any we now possess, they would not

enable us to obtain by direct vision any idea of the ultimate molecules

of matter. Sorby calculates that the smallest sphere of organic matter

which coiild be clearly defined with our most powerful microscopes would

contain many millions of molecules of albumen and water, and it follows

that there may be an almost infinite number of structural characters in

organic tissues, which we can at present foresee no mode of examining.

which was formerly treated as a local phenomenon, being now shown to

form part of a vast system of mutually dependent cyclonic and anti-

cyclonic movements. The storm-signals issued at our ports are very

valuable to sailors, while the small weather-maps, for which we are mainly

indebted to Francis Galton, and the forecasts, which anyone can obtain

on application either personally or by telegraph at the Meteorological

Office, are also of increasing utility.

Electricity in the year 1831 may be considered to have just been

ripe for  its  adaptation to  practical purposes                                                                                     it  was  but                                      a    few years
                                                                                                                                  ;

previously, in 1819, that Oersted had discovered the deflective action

of the current on the magnetic needle, that Ampere had laid the founda-

tion of electro-dynamics, that Schweizzer had devised the electric coil or

multiplier, and that Sturgeon had constructed the first electro-magnet.

It was in 1831 that Faraday, the prince of pure experimentalists,

announced his discoveries of voltaic induction and magneto-electricity,

which with the other three discoveries constitute the principles of nearly

all the telegraph instruments now in use ; and in 1834 our knowledge of
the nature of the electric current had been much advanced by the in-

teresting experiment of Sir Charles Wheatstone, proving the velocity of

the current in a metallic conductor to approach that of the wave of light.

Practical applications of these discoveries were not long in coming to

the fore, and the first telegraph line on the Great Western Railway from

Paddington to West Di'ayton was set up in 1838. In America Morse is

said to have commenced to develop his recording instrument between

the years 1882 and 1837, while Steinheil, in Germany, during the same

period was engaged upon his somewhat super-refined ink-recorder, using

for the first time the earth for completing the return circuit ; whereas in
this country Cooke and Wheatstone, by adopting the more simple device

of the double-needle instrument, were the first to make the electric tele-

graph a practical institution. Contemporaneously with, or immediately

succeeding these pioneers, we find in this country Alexander Bain, Bre-

guet in France, Schilling in Russia, and Werner Siemens in Germany,

the last having first, in 1847, among others, made use of gutta-percha

as an insulating medium for electric conductors, and thus cleared the

way for subterranean and submarine telegraphy.

Four years later, in 1851, submarine telegraphy became an accom-

plished fact through the successful establishment of telegraphic

communication between Dover and Calais. Submarine lines followed in

rapid succession, crossing the English Channel and the German Ocean,

threading their way through the Mediterranean, Black, and Red Seas,

until in 1866, after two abortive attempts, telegraphic communication

was successfully established between the Old and New Worlds, beneath

the Atlantic Ocean.

In connection with this great enterprise and with many investigations

and suggestions of a highly scientific and important character, the name

of Sir William Thomson will ever be remembered. The ingenuity

displayed in perfecting the means of transmitting intelligence through

metallic conductors, with the utmost despatch and certainty as regards

the record obtained, between two points hundreds and even thousands of

miles apart is truly surprising. The instruments devised by Morse,

Siemens, and Hughes have also proved most useful.  .

Duplex and quadruplex telegraphy, one of the most striking achieve-

ments of modern telegraphy, the result of the labours of several in-

ventors, should not be passed over in silence. It not only serves for the

simultaneoixs communication of telegraphic intelligence in both directions,

but renders it possible for four instruments to be worked irre.'ipectively

of one another, through one and the same wire connecting two distant

places.
--38 EEPOET 1881.

     Another more recent and perhaps still more wonderful achievement
in modern telegraphy is the invention of the telephone and microphone,
by means of which the human voice is transmitted through the electric
conductor, by mechanism that imposes through its extreme simplicity.
In this connection the names of Reiss, Graham Bell, Edison, and Hughes

are those chiefly deserving to be recorded.
     Whilst electricity has thus furnished us with the means of flashing

our thoughts by record or by voice from place to place, its use is now

gradually extending for the achievement of such quantitative effects as
the jjroduction of light, the transmission of mechanical power, and the
precipitation of metals. The principle involved in the magneto-electric
and dynamo-electric machines, by which these efiects are accomplished,

may be traced to Faraday's discovery in 1831 of the induced current, but
their realisation to the labours of Holmes, Siemens, Pacinotti, Gramme,

and others. In the electric light, gas-lighting has found a formidable
competitor, which appears destined to take its place in public illumination,
and in lighting large halls, works, &c., for which purposes it combines
brilliancy and freedom from obnoxious products of combustion, with

comparative cheapness. The electric light seems also to threaten, when
sub-divided in the manner recently devised by Edison, Swan, and others,
to make inroads into our dwelling-houses.

    By the electric transmission of power, we may hope some day to

utilise at a distance such natural sources of energy as the Falls of

Niagara, and to work our cranes, lifts, and machinery of every descrip-
tion by means of sources of power arranged at convenient centres. To
these applications the brothers Siemens have more recently added the
propulsion of trains by currents passing through the rails, the fusion
in considerable quantities of highly refractory substances, and the use of
electric centres of light in horticulture as proposed by Werner and William

Siemens. By an essential impi'ovement by Faure of the Plante Secondary

Batteiy, the problem of storing electrical energy appears to have received
a practical solution, the real importance of which is clearly proved by Sir

Wilham Thomson's recent investigation of the subject.

     It would be difficult to assign the limits to which this development of

electrical energy may not be rendered serviceable for the purposes of man.

     As regards mathematics I have felt that it would be impossible for

me, even with the kindest help, to write anything myself. Mr. Spottis-

woode, however, has been so good as to supply me with the following

memorandum.

      In a complete survey of the progress of science during the half-century
which has intervened between our first and our present meeting, the part

played by mathematics would form no insigniflcant feature. To those
indeed who are outside its enchanted circle it is difficult to realise the
intense intellectual energy which actuates its devotees, or the wide
expanse over which that enei"gy ranges. Some measure, however, of its
                                                                              ADDRESS.                          39

progress may perhaps be formed by considering, in one or two cases,

from what simple principles some of the great recent developments have

taken their origin.

Consider, for instance, what is known as the principle of signs. In

geometry we are concerned with quantities such as lines and angles and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

in the old systems a proposition was proved with reference to a particular

figure. This figure might, it is true, be drawn in any manner within

certain  ranges  of  limitation                                               but if the limits were exceeded,  a new
                                                                           ;

proof, and often a new enunciation, became necessary. Gradually, how-

ever, it came to be jierceived {e.g. by Carnot, in his ' Geometric de

Position,') that some propositions were true even when the quantities were

reversed in direction. Hence followed a recognition of the principle (of

signs) that every line should be regarded as a directed line, and every

angle as measured in a definite direction. By means of this simple con-

sideration, geometry has acquired a power similar to that of algebra, viz.

of changing the signs of the quantities and transposing their positions, so

as at once, and without fresh demonstration, to give rise to new propo-

sitions.

     To take another instance. The properties of triangles, as established
by Euclid, have always been considered as legitimate elements of proof ;

so that, when in any figure two triangles occur, their relations may be
used as steps in a demonstration. But, within the period of which I am

speaking, other general geometi-ical relations, e.g. those of a pencil of
rays, or of their intersection with a straight line, have been recognised as

serving a similar purpose. "With what extensive results this generalisa-
tion has been attended, the Geometric Superieure of the late M. Chasles,
and all the superstructure built on Anharmonic Ratio as a foundation,

will be sufficient evidence.

     Once more, the algebraical expression for a line or a plane involves two
sets of quantities, the one relating to the position of any point in the line
or plane, and the other relating to the position of the line or plane in
space. The former set alone were originally considered variable, the latter
constant. But as soon as it was seen that either set might at pleasure be
regarded as variable, there was opened out to mathematicians the whole
field of duality within geometry proper, and the theory of correlative
figures which is destined to occupy a prominent position in the domain of

mathematics.

     Not unconnected with this is the marvellous extension which the

transformation of geometrical figures has received very largely from
Cremona and the Italian school, and which in the hands of our country-

men Hirst and the late Professor Clifford, has already brought forth such

--abundant fruit. In this, it may be added, there lay dormant, it is true,

--and long unnoticed the principle whereby circular may be converted into

--rectilinear motion, and vice versa, a problem which until the time of

Peaucillier seemed so far from solution, that one of the greatest mathe-
maticians of the day thought that he had proved its entire impossibility.
--40 KEPOBT 1881.

In the hands of Sylvester, of Kempe, and others, this principle haa

been developed into a general theory of link- work, on which the last word

has not yet been said.

    If. time permitted, I might point out how the study of particular

geometric figures, such as curves and surfaces, has been in many instances

replaced by that of systems of figures infinite in number, and indeed of

various degrees of infinitude. Such, for instance, are Pliicker's com-

plexes and congruencies. I might describe also how Riemann taught us

that surfaces need not present simple extension without thickness but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

that, without losing their essential geometric character, they may consist

of manifold sheets ; and thus our conception of space, and our power

of interpreting otherwise perplexing algebraical expressions, become

immensely enlarged.

    Other generalisations might be mentioned, such as the principle of

continuity, the use of imaginary quantities, the extension of the number

of the dimensions of space, the recognition of systems in which the

axioms of Euclid have no place. But as these were discussed in a recent

address, I need not now do more than remind you that the germs of the-

great calculus of Quaternions were first announced by their author, the

late Sir W. R. Hamilton, at one of our meetings.

    Passing from geometry proper to the other great branch of mathe-

matical machinery, viz. algebra, it is not too much to say that Avithin
the period now in review there has grown up a modern algebra which

to our founders would have appeared like a confused dream, and whose

very language and terminology would be as an unknown tongue.

    Into this subject I do not propose to lead you far. But, as the

progress which has been made in this direction is certainly not less than

that made in geometry, I will ask your attention to one or two points-

"which stand notably prominent.

    In algebra we use ordinary equations involving one unknown quan-

tity ; in the application of algebra to geometry we meet with equations,
representing curves or surfaces, and involving two, or three, unknown

quantities respectively                                                                                                   in the theory of probabilities, and in other branches
                                                                                                                       ;

of research, we employ still more general expressions. Now the modern

algebra, originating with Cayley and Sylvester, regards all these diverse

expressions as belonging to one and the same family, and comprises them

all under the same general term ' quantics.' Studied fj-om this point of

view, they all alike give rise to a class of derivative forms, previously

unnoticed, but now known as invariants, covariants, canonical forms, etc.
By means of these, mathematicians have arrived not only at many pro-

perties of the quantics themselves, but also, at their application to physical

problems. It would be a long and perhaps invidious task to enumerate

the many workers in this fertile field of research, especially in the schools

of  Germany and  of  Italy                                                                                                but  it  is perhaps the  less  necessary to  do so,
                                                 ;

because Sylvester, aided by a young and vigoi-ons staff at Baltimore,

is welding many of these results into a homogeneous mass in the

classical memoirs wliicli arc appearing from time to time iu the

' American Journal of Mathematics.'

In order to I'emove any impression that these extensions of algebra

are mei-ely barren speculations of ingenious intellects, I may add that,

many of these derivative forme, at least in their elementary stages, have

already  found  their  way  into  the  text-books  of  mathematics                                                             and  one
                                                                                                                            ;

class in particular, known by the name of determinants, is now introduced

as a recognised method of algebra, greatly to the convenience of all those

who become masters of its use.

In the extension of mathematics it has happened more than once that

laws have been established so simple in form, and so obvious in their

necessity, as scarcely to require proof. And yet their application is often

of the highest importance in checking conclusions which have been

di-awn fi'om other considerations, as well as in leading to conclusions

which, without their aid, might have been difficult of attainment. The

same thing has occurred also in physics and notably in the recognition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

of what has been termed the ' Law of the Conservation of Energy.'

Energy has been defined to be ' The capacity, or power, of any body,

or system of bodies, when in a given condition, to do a measurable quantity

of work.' Such work may either change the condition of the bodies

in question, or it may affect other bodies ; but in either case energy is

expended by the agent upon the recipient in performance of the work.

The law then states that the total amount of energy in the agents and

recipients taken together remains unaltered by the changes in question.

    Now the principle on which the law depends is this : ' that every kind

of change among the bodies may be expressed numerically in one standard

unit of change, viz., work done, in such wise that the result of the

passage of any system from one condition to another may be calculated

by mere additions and subtractions, even when we do not know how the

change came about. This being so, all work done by a system may be

expressed as a diminution of energy of that system, and all work done

upon a system as an accession of energy. Consequently, the energy lost

by one system in performance of work will be gained by another in having

work done upon it, and the total energy, as between the two systems, will

remain unchanged.

There are two cases, or conditions, of energy which, although sub-

stantially the same, are for convenience regarded separately. These may

be illustrated by the following example. Work may be done upon a body,

and energy communicated to it, by setting it in motion, e.g. by lifting it

against gravity. Suppose this to be done by a spring and detent ; and

suppose further the body, on reaching its highest point, to be caught so

as to rest at that level on a support. Then, whether we consider the body
at the moment of starting, or when resting on the support, it has equally

received an accession of energy from the spring, and is therefore equally
capable of communicating energy to a third body. But in the one case

this is due to the motion which it has acquired, and in the other to the
42 EEPORT-- 1881.

position at which it rests, and to its capability of falling again when the

support is removed. Energy in the first of these states is called ' Energy

of Motion,' or ' Kinetic Energy,' and that in the second state, ' Energy of

Position,' or ' Potential Energy.' In the case supposed, at the moment of

starting, the whole of the energy is kinetic                                                                                                                                                                                         as the body rises, the energy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

becomes partly potential and partly kinetic ; and when it reaches the

highest point the energy has become wholly potential. If the body be

again dropped, the process is reversed.

The history of a discovery, or invention, so simple at first sight, is

often found to be moi'e complicated the more thoroughly it is examined.

That which at first seems to have been due to a single mind proves to

have been the result of the successive action of many minds. Attempts

·more or less successful in the same direction are frequently traced out

and even unsuccessful efibrts may not have been without influence on

minds turned towards the same object. Lastly also, germs of thought,

originally not fully understood, sometimes prove in the end to have been

the first stages of growth towards tiltimate fruit. The history of the law

of the conservation of energy forms no exception to this order of events.

There are those who discern even in the writings of Newton expressions

which show that he was in possession of some ideas which, if followed

out in a direct line of thought, would lead to those now entertained on

the subjects of energy and of work. But however this may be, and

whosoever might be reckoned among the earlier contributors to the general

subject of energy, and to the establishment of its laws, it is certain that

within the period of which I am now speaking, the names of Seguin,

Clausius, Helmholtz, Mayer, and Colding on the Continent, and those

of Grove, Joule, Rankine, and Thomson in this country, will always be

associated with this great work.

I must not, however, quit this subject without a passing notice of a

conclusion to which Sir William Thomson has come, and in which he is
followed by others who have pursued the transformation of energy to some

of its ultimate consequences. The nature of this will perhaps be most

easily apprehended by reference to a single instance. In a steam engine,

or other engine, in which the motive power depends upon heat, it is well
known that the source of power lies not in the general temperature of the

whole, but merely on the difference of temperature between that of the

boiler and that of the condenser. And the effect of the condenser is to

reduce the steam issuing from the boiler to the same temperature as that of

the condenser. "When this is once done, no more work can be got out of

the engine, unless fresh heat be supplied from an outside source to the

boiler. The heat originally communicated to the boiler has become

uniformly diffused, and the energy due to that difference is said to have

been dissipated. The energy remains in a potential condition as regards

Nowother bodies ; but as regards the engine, it is of no further use.

sipated, and we shall have arrived at a condition of things from which
there is no apparent escape. This is what is called the ' Dissipation of

Energy.'

Prof. Frankland has been so good as to draw up for me the following'

account of the progress of Chemistry diii-ing the last half-century.

Most of the elements had been discovered before 1830, the majority

of the rarer elements since the beginning of the century. In addition to

these the following five have been discovered, three of them by Mosander,

--viz.: lanthanum in 1839, didj-mium in 1842, and erbium in 1843.

Ruthenium was discovered by Glaus in 1843, and niobium by Rose in

--1844. Spectrum Analysis has added five to the list, viz.: Caesium and

rubidium, which were discovered by Bunsen and Kirchhoffin 1860; thal-

lium, by Crookes  in     1861 ;  indium, by Reich                                                                                                                                                and Richter in  1863                       and

As regards theoretical views, the atomic theory, the foundation of

scientific chemistry, had been propounded by Dalton (1804-1808). The

.three laws which have been chiefly instrumental in establishing the true

--atomic weights of the elements the law of Avogadro (1811), that equal

volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure

contain equal numbers of molecules                                                                                                                                                               the law of Dulong and Petit  (1819),
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

that the capacities for heat of the atoms of the various elements are

equal; and Mitscherlich's law of isomorphism (1819), according to which

equal numbers of atoms of elements belonging to the same class may

replace each other in a compound without altering the crystalline form

of the latter, had been enunciated in quick succession ; but the true ap-

plication of these three laws, though in every case distinctly stated by

the discoverers, failed to be generally made, and it was not till the rectifi-

cation of the atomic weights by Cannizzaro, in ] 858, that these important

discoveries bore fruit.

In organic chemistry the views most generally held about the year

1830 were expressed in the radical theory of Berzelius. This theory,
which was first stated in its electro-chemical and duahstic form by its

author in 1817, received a further development at his hands in 1834

after the discovery of the benzoyl-radical by Liebig and Wohler. In the
same year (1834), however, a discovery was made by Dumas, which was

destined profoundly to modify the electro- chemical portion of the theory,

and even to overthrow the form of it put forth by Berzelius. Dumas

showed that an electro-negative element, such as chlorine, might replace,
atom for atom, an electro-positive element like hydrogen, in some cases

without much alteration in the character of the compound. This law of

substitution has formed a necessary portion of every chemical theory
which has been proposed since its discovery, and its importance has

increased with the progress of the science. It would take too long to

enumerate all the theoretical views which have prevailed at various times
44 EEPQET 1881.

dni'Ing the past fifty years ; but the theory whicli along with the radical

theory has exercised most influence on the development of the views now
held, is the theoiy of types, first stated by Dumas (1839) and developed

in a diff'erent form and amalgamated with the radical theory by Gerhardt

and Williamson (1848-1852). It is, however, the less necessary to refer

in detail to these views, seeing that in the now jirevailing theory of atomi-

city we possess a generalisation which, while greatly extending the scope
of chemical science in its power of classifying known and predicting
unknown facts, includes all that was valuable in the generalisations
which preceded it. The study of the behaviour of organo-metallic

compounds in chemical reactions led to the conclusion that various

metallic elements possess a definite capacity of saturation with regard to

the number of atoms of other elements with which thej can combine,

and demonstrated this regularity of atom-fixing power in the case of

Azinc, tin, arsenic, and antimony.  serious obstacle, however, in the

way of determining the true atomicities of the elements was the general

employment of the old so-called equivalent weights which were by most

chemists confounded with the atomic weights. This difficulty was

removed by the rectification of the atomic weights, which, though begun

by Gerhardt as early as 1842, met for a long time with but little recog-

nition, and was not completed till the subject was taken up by Cannizzaro

in 1858. The law of atomicity lias given to chemistry an exactness

which it did not previously possess, and since its discovery and recog-

nition chemical research has moved very much on the lines laid down by

this law.

Chemists have been engaged in determining, by means of decom-

positions, the molecular architecture, or constihition as it is called, of

various compounds, natural and artificial, and in verifying by synthesis

the correctness of the views thus arrived at.

     It was long supposed that an impassable barrier existed between
inorganic and organic substances : that the chemist could make the

former in his laboratorj-, while the latter could only be produced in the

--living bodies of animals or plants, requiring for their construction not

only chemical attraction, but a supposed ' vital force.' It was not until
1828 that Wohler broke down this barrier by the synthetic production of

urea, and since his time this branch of science, in the hands of Hofmann,

Wurtz, Berthelot, Butlerow, and others, has made great strides. In-

numerable natural compounds have thus been produced in the labora-

--tory ranging from bodies of relatively simple constitution, such as the

alcohols and acids of the fatty series, to bodies of such complex mole-

cular structure as alizarin (the principal colouring matter of madder),

coumarin (the odoriferous principle of the tonqua bean), vanillin, and

indigo. The problem of the natural alkaloids has also been attacked, in

some C8/Ses with more than partial success. Methylconine, which occurs

along with conine in the hemlock, has been recently prepared artificially

by Michael and Gundelach, this being the first instance of the synthesis
                                                                                                        ADDRESS.                            45

Aof a natural alkaloid.                                                                                 proximate synthesis of atropine, the alkaloid of

the deadly nightshade, has been accomplished by Ladenburg. It seems

further probable that at no distant date the useful alkaloids, such as

quinine, may also be synthesised, inasmuch as quinoline, one of the pro-

ducts of the decomposition of quinine and of some of the allied bases

has recently been prepared by Skraup by a method which admits of its

being obtained in any quantity.

    Much also has been done in the way of building up compounds the

existence of which was predicted by theory. Indeed the extent to which

hitherto undiscovered substances can be predicated is doubtless the
greatest triumph achieved by chemists during the past fifty years.

     As yet, however, only the statical side of chemistry has been de-

veloped. Whilst the physicist has been engaged in tracing, for the

gaseous condition at least, the paths of the molecules and calculatino-

their velocities, the chemist, whose business is with the atoms within

the molecule, can point to no such scientific conquests. All that he
knows concerning the intramolecular atoms, and all that he expresses

in his constitutional formulce is, the particular relation of union in which

--each of these atoms stands to the others Avhich of them are directly

united (as he expresses it) to other given atoms, and which of them are
in indirect union. Of the i-elative positions in space occupied by these
atoms, and of their modes of motion, he is absolutely ignorant. In like
manner in a chemical reaction the initial and final conditions of the

--reacting substances are known, but the intermediate stages the modes
--of change are for the most part unexplained.

The feeling that no number, however great, of successfully solved

problems of constitutional chemistry (as at present understood), and

no number of syntheses, however brilliant, of natui-al compounds, could

--raise chemistry above the statical stage that the solution of the dyna-

mical problem cannot be arrived at by purely chemical means has led

many chemists to approach the subject from the physical side. The

results which the physico-chemical methods, as exemplified in the laws

already alluded to of Dulong and Petit, Avogadro, and Mitscherlich,

have yielded in the past, offer the best guarantee of their success in

the future. And the advantages of many of the physical methods are

--obvious. Every purely chemical examination whether proximate or
--ultimate of a compound, presupposes the destruction of the substance

under examination                                                                                       the chemist ' murders to dissect.'  But observations

on the action of a substance on the rays of light, on the relative volumes

occupied by molecular quantities of a substance, on its velocity of trans-

piration in the liquid or gaseous state-- these teach us the habits of

the living substance. The rays of light which have threaded their way

between the molecules of a body have undergone, in contact with these

molecules, various specific and measurable changes, the nature and

amount of which are assuredly conditioned by the mass, form, and other

properties of the molecules : the plane of polarisation has been caused to

certain wave-lengths have been removed by absorption, their absence

being manifested by bands in the absorption-spectrum of the substance.

The volumes occupied by molecular quantities are dependent partly on the

size of the molecules and partly on that of the intermolecular spaces.

     The duty of the physical chemist is to endeavour to co-ordinate his
physical observations with the known constitution of compounds as

already determined by the pure chemist. This endeavour has in various

branches of physical chemistry been to some extent successful. Le Bel

has found that among organic compounds those only possess action on

the plane of polarised light which contain at least one asymmetric car-

--bon atom -that is to say, a carbon atom which is united to four different

atoms or groups of atoms. The researches of Landolt, of Gladstone,

and of Briihl on the specific refraction of organic liquids, have shown

that from the known constitution of a liquid organic compound it is

possible to calculate its specific refraction. Noel Hartley, in an examina-

tion of the absorption-spectra of organic liquids for the ultra-violet rays,

has demonstrated that certain molecular groupings are represented by

particular absorption-bands, and this line of inquiry has been extended,

with very interesting results, to the ultra-red rays by Abney and Testing.
It is obvious that these methods may in ti>rn be employed to determine

the unknown constitution of substances. The same holds true of the

investigations of Kopp with regard to the molecular volumes of liquids at

their boiling-points, in which he has established the remai'kable fact that

some elements always possess the same atomic volume in combination,

whereas, in the case of certain other elements, the atomic volume varies

in a perfectly definite manner with the mode of combination. This in-

vestigation has lately been extended with the best results by Thorpe and

by Ramsay. Thermo-chemistry, also, which for a long time, at least as

regards that portion which relates to the heat of formation of compounds,

consisted chiefly of a collection of single equations, each containing three

unknown quantities, is beginning to be interpreted by Julius Thomson,

whose experimental work in this field is well known. Many other

methods of physico-chemical research are being successfully prosecuted

at the present day, but it would go beyond the bounds of this summary

even to enumerate these.

The concordant results obtained by these widely differing methods

show that those chemists who have devoted themselves, frequently amid

the ridicule of their more practical brethren, to ascertaining by purely

chemical methods the constitution of compounds, have not laboured in

vain. But the future doubtless belongs to physical chemistry.

    In connection with the rectification of the atomic weights it may be

mentioned that a so-called natural system of the elements has been intro-

duced by MendelejeflF (1869), in which the properties of the elements

appear as a periodic function of their atomic weights. By the aid of this

system it has been possible to pi'edict the properties and atomic weights

many atomic weights which had not been fixed by any of the usual

methods. Several of these predictions have been verified in a remarkable

Amanner.  periodicity in the atomic weights of elements belonging to

the same class had been pointed out by Newlands about four years before

the publication of Mendelejeflf's memoir.

In mechanical science the progress has not been less remarkable

than in other branches. Indeed to the improvements in mechanics we

owe no small part of our advance in practical civilization, and of the

increase of our national prosperity during the last fifty years.

     This immense development of mechanical science has been to a oreat
extent a consequence of the new processes which have been adopted in

the manufacture of iron, for the following data with reference to which I

am mainly indebted to Captain Douglas Galton and Mr. Stuart Rendel.

About 1830, Neilson introduced the Hot Blast in the smelting of iron.
At first a temperature of 600° or 700° Fahrenheit was obtained, but
Cowper subsequently ajjplied Siemens' regenerative furnace for heatino-

the blast, chiefly by means of fumes from the blast furnace, which were

formerly wasted ; and the temperature now practically in use is as much
as 1,400° or even more : the result is a very great economy of fuel and

an increase of the output. For instance, in 1830, a blast furnace with
the cold blast would probably produce 130 tons per week, whereas now,
600 tons a week are readily obtained.

Bessemer, by his brilliant discovery, which he first brought before the

British Association at Cheltenham in 18-56, showed that Iron and Steel

could be produced by forcing currents of atmospheric air through fluid

pig metal, thus avoiding for the first time the intermediate process of

puddling iron, and converting it by cementation into steel. Similarly by

Siemens' regenerative furnace, the pig metal and iron ore is converted

directly into steel, especially mild  steel for  shipbuilding and boilers                                                                                           and
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Whitworth, by his fluid compression of steel, is enabled to produce steel in

the highest condition of density and strength of which the metal is capable.

These changes, by which steel can be produced direct from the blast

furnace instead of by the more cumbersome processes formerly in use

have been followed by improvements in the manipulation of the metal.

    The inventions of Cort and others were known long before 1830, but
we were then still without the most powerful tool in the hands of the

practical metallurgist, viz., Nasmyth's steam-hammer.

    Steel can now be produced as cheaply as iron was formerly ; and its

substitution for iron as railway material and in shipbuilding, has resulted

in increased safety in railway travelling, as well as in economy, from its
vastly greater durability. Moreover, the enlarged use of iron and steel,
which has resulted from these improvements in its make, has led to the
adoption of mechanical means to supersede hand labor in almost every
branch of trade and agriculture, by which the power of production has
48 EEPORT 1881.

been increased a Imnclredfold, wliile at the same time raucli higLer pre-

cision has been obtained. Sir Joseph Whitworth has done more than any-

one else to perfect the machinery of this coantry by the continued efforts

he has made, during nearly half-a-century, to introduce accuracy into the

standards of measurement in use in workshops. He tells us that Avhen he

first established his works, no two articles could be made accurately alike

or with interchangeable parts. He devised a measuring apparatus, by

which his workmen in making standard gauges are accustomed to take

measurements to the tto^oo o^ ^^ inch.

In its more immediate relation to the objects of this Association, the

increased importance of iron and steel has led to numerous scientific

investigations into its mechancial properties and into the laws which

govern its strength ; into the proper distribution of the material in con-

struction ; and into the conditions which govern the friction and adhesion
of surfaces. The names of Eaton Hodgkinson, Fairbairn, Barlow,
Rennie, Scott Russell, Willis, Pleeming Jenkin, and Galton are promi-

nently associated with these inquiries.

The introduction of iron has, moreover, had a vast influence on the

works of both the civil and military engineer. Before 1830, Telford had

constructed an iron suspension turnpike-road bridge of 560 feet over the
Menai Straits ; but this bridge was not adapted to the heavy weights of
locomotive engines. At the present time, with steel at his command, Mr.

Fowler is eno-aged in carrying out the design for a railway bridge over

the Forth, of two spans     of  1,700 feet  each                         that is  to say, of  nearly one
                                                                      ;

third of a mile in length. In artillery, bronze has given place to wrought

iron and steel ; the 68-pound shot, which was the heaviest projectile fifty

years ago, with its range of about 1,200 yards, is being replaced by a shot

of neai'ly a  quartei--ton  weight,  with   a  range                     of nearly  five      miles                        and
                                                                                                                        ;

the armour-plates of ships are daily obtaining new developments.

But it is in raih'oads, steamers, and the electric telegraph that the

proo-ress of mechanical science has most strikingly contributed to the

welfare of man.
     As reo^ards railways, the Stockton and Dai'lington Railway was

opened in 1825, but the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, perhaps the
first truly passenger line, dates from 1830, while the present mileage of

railways is over 200,000 miles, costing nearly 4,000,000,000?. sterling.

It was not until 1838 that the Sirins and Great Western first steamed
across the Atlantic. The steamer, in fact, is an excellent epitome of the
progress of the half-century ; the paddle has been superseded by the
screw ; the compound has replaced the simple engine ; wood has given place
to iron, and iron in its turn to steel. The saving in dead weight, by this
improvement alone, is from 10 to 16 per cent. The speed has been in-

·creased from 9 knots to 15, or even more. Lastly, the steam-pressure has
been increased from less than 5 lbs. to 70 lbs. per square inch, while the

consumption of coal has been brought down from 5 or 6 lbs. per horse-power

to less than 2. It is a remarkable fact that not only is our British

shipping rapidly on the increase, but it is increasing relatively to that
of the rest of the world. In 1860 our tonnage was 5,700,000 against

7,200,000; while it may now be placed as 8,500,000 against 8,200,000;

so that considerably more than half the whole shipping of the world

belongs to this country.

If I say little with reference to economic science and statistics it is

because time, not materials, are wanting.

I scarcely think that in the present state of the question I can be

accused of wandering into politics if I observe that the establishment of

the doctrine of free trade as a scientific truth falls within the period

under review.

    In education some progress has been made towards a more rational

system. When I was a boy, neither science, nor modern languages, nor

arithmetic formed any part of the public school, system of the country.

This is now happily changed. Much, however, still remains to be done.

Too little time is still devoted to French and German, and it is much to

be regretted that even in some of our best schools they are taught as dead

languages. Lastly, with few exceptions, only one or two hours a week

Weon an average are devoted to science.     have, I am sure, none of us

any desire to exclude, or discourage, literature. What we ask is that, say,

six hours a week each should be devoted to mathematics, modern lan-

--guages, and science an arrangement which would still leave twenty

hours for Latin and Greek. I admit the difficulties which schoolmasters

have to contend with; nevertheless, when we consider what science has
done and is doing for us, we cannot but consider that our present system

of education is, in the words of the Duke of Devonshire's Commission,

little less than a national misfortune.

In agriculture the changes which have occurred in the period since

1831 have been immense. The last half-century has witnessed the in-
troduction of the modern S3'stem of subsoil drainage, founded on the ex-
periments of Smith of Deanston. The thrashing and drilling machines

reaping-machine, which not only cuts the corn but binds it into sheaves

while the steam-engine thrashes out the grain and builds the ricks.

Science has thus greatly reduced the actual cost of labour, and yet it has

increased the wa^es of the labourer.

     It was to the British Association, at Glasgow in 1841, that Baron

Liebig first communicated his work ' On the Application of Chemistry to
Vegetable Physiology,' while we have also from time to time received

accounts of the persevering and important experiments which Mr. Lawes,

with the assistance of Dr. Gilbert, has now carried on for more than

forty years at Rothamsted, and which have given so great an impulse to
agriculture by directing attention to the principles of cropping, and by
leading to the more philosophical application of manures.

    I feel that in quitting Section F so soon, I owe an apology to our
fellow-workers in that branch of science, but I doubt not that my short-

comings will be more than made up for by the address of their excellent

President, Mr. Grant-Duff, whose appointment to the Governorship of

Madras, while occasioning so sad a loss to his friends, will unquestion-

ably prove a great advantage to India, and materially conduce to the

progress of science in that country.

Moreover, several other subjects of much importance, which might

have been referred to in connection with these latter Sections, I have

already dealt with under their more purely scientific aspect.

Indeed, one very marked feature in modern discovery is the manner

in which distinct branches of science have thrown, and are throwinar,

light on one another. Thus the study of geographical distribution of

living beings, to the knowledge of which our late general secretary, Mr.

Sclater, has so greatly contributed, has done much to illustrate ancient

geography. The existence of high northern forms in the Pyrenees and

Alps indicates the existence of a period of cold when Arctic species

--occupied the whole of habitable Europe. Wallace's line as it has been
--justly named after that distinguished naturalist points to the very

ancient separation between the Malayan and Australian regions; and

the study of corals has thrown light upon the nature and significance of
atolls and barrier-reefs.

In studying the antiquity of man, the archaeologist has to invoke the

aid of the chemist, the geologist, the physicist, and the mathematician.

The recent progress in astronomy is greatly due to physics and chemistry.

In geology the composition of rocks is a question of chemistry and physics;

the determination of the boundaries of the different formations falls within

the limits of  geography                                                                                                       while pateontology is the biology of the past.
                                                                 ;

And now I must conclude. I fear I ought to apologise to you for

keeping you so long, but still more strongly do I wish to express my

regret that there are almost innumerable researches of great interest and

importance which fall within the last fifty years (many even among those

with which our Association has been connected) to which I have found it
impossible to refer. Such for instance are, in biology alone, Owen's

memorable report on the homologies of the vertebrate skeleton,

Carpenter's laborious researches on the microscopic structure of shells,

the reports on marine zoology by Allman, Forbes, Jeffreys, Spence Bate,

Norman, and others                                                                                                             on Kent's Cavern by Pengelly, those by Duncan on
                                                                                                                            ;

corals Woodward on                                                                                                             Crustacea ;  Carruthers, Williamson, and others  on
                                  ;

fossil botany, and many more. Indeed no one who has not had occasion

to study the progress of science throughout its various departments can

-- --have any idea how enormous how unprecedented the advance has been.

    Though it is difficult, indeed impossible, to measure exactly the extent

of the influence exercised by this Association, no one can doubt that it

has been very considerable. For my own part, I must acknowledge with
gratitude how much the interest of my life has been enhanced by the
                                                                                                                       ADDKESS.                                                                                                                                         5

stimulus of our meetings, by the lectures and memoirs to wliich I have

had the advantage of listening, and above all, by the many friendships

which I owe to this Association,

    Summing up the principal results which have been attained in the last
half-century we may mention (over and above the accumulation of facts)

the theory of evolution, the antiquity of man, and the far greater anti-

quity of the world itself ; the correlation of physical forces and the con-

servation of energy                                                                                          spectrum  analysis  and  its                                                                                                              application  to  celestial

physics ; the higher algebra and the modern geometry ; lastly, the in-

--numerable applications of science to practical life as, for instance, in

photography, the locomotive engine, the electric telegraph, the spectro-

scope, and most recently the electric light and the telephone.

To science, again, we owe the idea of progress. The ancients, says

Bagehot, ' had no conception of progress ; they did not so much as

reject the idea ; they did not even entertain it.' It is not, I think, going

too far to say that the true test of the civilisation of a nation must now

be measured by its progress in science. It is often said, however, that

great and unexpected as the recent discoveries have been, there are certain

ultimate problems which mtist ever remain unsolved. For my part I would

prefer to abstain from laying down any such limitations. "When Park

asked the Arabs what became of the sun at night, and whether the sun was

always the same, or new each day, they replied that such a question was

childish and entii-ely beyond the reach of human investigation. I have

already mentioned that, even as lately as 1842, so high an authority as

Comte treated as obviously impossible and hopeless any attempt to

determine the chemical composition of the heavenly bodies. Doubtless

there are questions, the solution of which we do not as yet see our way

even to attempt ; nevertheless the experience of the past warns us not

to limit the possibilities of the future.

But however this may be, though the progress made has been so rapid,

and though no similar period in the woi-ld's history has been nearly so

prolific of great results, yet, on the other hand, the prospects of the

Wefuture were never more encouraging.                                                                                                 must not, indeed, shut our

eyes to the possibility of failure ; the temptation to military ambition

the tendency to over-interference by the state                                                                                                                                                                                                         the  spirit of anarchy and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

socialism ; these and other elements of danger may mar the fair prospects

of the future. That they will succeed, however, in doing so, I cannot

believe. I cannot but feel confident that fifty years hence, when

perhaps the city of York may renew its myhospitable invitation, suc-

--cessor in this chair more competent, I trust, than I have been to do

--justice to so grand a theme will have to record a series of discoveries

even more unexpected and more brilliant than those which I have, I fear

so imperfectly, attempted to bring before you this evening, for assuredly

one great lesson which science teaches is, how little we yet know, and how
much we have still to learn.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sylvester, Profes-

   sor Cayley, and Professor Salmon, for the calculation of Tables
   of the Fundamental Invariants of Algebraic Forms.
The principal work performed by aid of tlie grant to the Committee

during the past year has been the calculation of the irreducible invariants
and covariants appertaining to the binary quantics of the 12th order by
Mr. F. Franklin, of Baltimore, under the direction of Professor Sylvester,

A brief synopsis of the result of this enormous computation is annexed.

by M. Camille Jordan's law ; so that in this, as lias also been proved to
be the case for all the forms of the 10th and lower orders, this so-called

limit to the order is the actual highest order itself.

     The computation of the ground-forms to the binary quantic of the
11th order, on account of the immense length of the calculations which
it would involve, has not been undertaken. It is to be hoped that this

may some day be accomplished, as it is probable that the generating func-

tion for this case would, like that for the 7th order, reveal some pecu-

liar features not observable in the generating function for quantics, the
orders of which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.

     Since the publication of the lists of ground- forms (calculated by aid
of the British Association grant) in the ' American Journal of Mathe-

matics,' Dr. Von Gall, of Mainz, has rendered a very important service
to algebraical science by applying the German method to the ascertain-
ment of the ground-forms of the binary quantic of the 8th order, and

his final results have been brought into perfect accordance with those
contained in the lists above referred to, witli the exception of one single
form of the deg-order 10'4, which he has not been able to decompose, but
which ought to be reducible if the fundamental postula e employed in
the English method is valid. It became, therefore, a matter of great
importance to demonstrate that no ground-form of such deg-order can

exist, for this will probably be the last occasion when it will be possible
to compare the results obtained by the two methods.

     Accordingly, Professor Sylvester, in conjunction with ]\Ir. Morgan

Jenkins, has calculated certain of the ground-forms for a particular func-
tion of the 8th order, and has therebj'- been able to demonstrate the
impossiblity of the existence of a ground-form of the deg-order in ques-

tion. This impossibility is made to depend ultimately on the fact that
the minor determinants of the 10th order belonging to a matrix 11 places
wide and 10 deep d© not all vanish, and the correctness of the figures
appearing in this matrix is demonstrated by showing that a certain de-
terminant of the 11th order, formed by adding on another line of figures
to this matrix, does vanish, which is practically effected by testing its
value in respect to various numerical moduli. The calculations have
been made independently by Mr. Sylvester and Mr. Jenkins, and concur

in proving (to the highest degree of moral certainty) the correctness of

the previous work. The non-existence of the doubtful ground-form may
accordingly be regarded as now placed beyond all reasonable doubt.

    A summary of the method employed, and the calculations to which

that method leads, has been sent for insertion in the ' Comptes Rendus '
of the Institute of France, and the whole of the work Avill be reproduced
in detail in the forthcoming Number of the ' American Journal of Mathe-

matics.'

   --Report on Recent Progress in Ifydrody nan tics. Part I.

                             Bij W. M. Hicks, M.A.

At the meeting of the Association at Swansea, last year, I was requested

to draw tip a report on the recent progress of hydi-odynamics. I have
interpreted this to extend back to the time of the last report to the
Association, in 1846, by Professor Stokes. Though the period is
somewhat extended, and necessitates a leport perhaps excessively long,

yet it seemed to me that this objection would be counterbalanced by the

advantage of the different reports to the Association forming a connected
series. The period separates itself naturally into three divisions, of about
ten years each : from 1846 to the publication of Helmholtz' paper on vortex

motion, in 1856 ; from then to the appearance of Thomson & Tait's

' Natural Philosophy,' in 1866, which introduced a new general method

into the treatment of hydrodynamics, by the application of the
Lagrangian Equations of .Motion ; and from the last period up to the pre-
sent time. I propose to consider the progress under the two heads of
(I.) General Theory and (II.) Special Problems, though stress of other

engagements has prevented my completing the second part in time for

this meeting. I hope, however, to complete it before the next meeting

of the Association.

    Under each head I have striven to keep as much as possible the

historical order in which the subjects have been developed, though, for
the sake of continuity, it has sometimes been necessary to deviate slightly
from this rule. It has not been an easy matter, out of such a rich field
of investigation, to decide what to include and what to leave out ; but it
is hojDcd that the most important results obtained dui'ing the last forty
years will be found referred to, although the report does not pretend to
be in any sense a complete bibliography of hydrodynamics. Several
subjects, whose boundaries are not sharply defined, have been neglected
altogether, as they would almost require reports to themselves ; such are,
for instance, the theory of sound and tides. The experimental side, also,

has not been considered, except in a few cases, in the way of reference.

These restrictions have been rendered necessary to keep the length of the
report within reasonable bounds.

                                        I. General Theory.

     Under this head I propose to notice successively (a) treatment of
General Equations for a perfect fluid, (&) Vortex Motion, (c) Discontinuous
Motion, (cZ) Genei-al Motion of solids in fluid (e) Viscosity, (/) Waves in

liquids.

                   (a) General Equations of motion of a perfect fluid.

     In 1856, Clebsch published a paper ' (it is signed ' August, 1854 ')
on the motion of an ellipsoid in fluid. The first part of the paper is

devoted to a transformation of the ordinary equations when there is a
velocity potential to moving axes, and thence to orthogonal curvilinear
co-ordinates. He expresses the sui-face conditions in terms of the same

co-ordinates, and shows that the velocity potential is a linear function of

the quantities which would now be called generalised velocities and
rotations. He then gives the pressures in the same generalised form,

                                                                    CreUe, 1856.
58 EEPORT-- 1881.

and shows bow they are simplified when the body has three planes of

symmetry. For this case he finds the generalised equations of motion in
terms of the pressures exerted on the surface of the solid, and considers
separately pure translation and pure rotation. Amongst results, be
notices that the fluid moves in ' stream lines ' (in Faden), that the effect
of the fluid is to cause an apparent increase of mass, different in different

--directions, a diminution of gravity ; and states the following laws :

* The form of the curves on which the particles of the fluid appear to
move relatively to the centre of gravity of the body depends only on the
form of the body and the curve on Avhich its centre of gravity moves.'
These results had already, several years before, been given by Stokes.'

    In the next year appeared another paper, by the same aufhor. On a

general transformation of the liydrodynaviical equations."^ This is ex-
ceedingly general, and starts with the consideration of equations analogous
to the hydrodynamical equations in n variables, viz. :

After reducing the foregoing results to the case of three variables, he shows

how to transform the independent variables to others. Lastly, he applies

the planes through the axis and Stokes' stream function. It is interesting

to see how these functions appear, though introduced in such a different

manner from those of Earnshaw and Stokes. The two-dimensional

stream function was also employed by Meissel, in a short paper,

' Ueber einen speciellen Fall des Ausflusses vomWasser in einer verticalen

Ebene,'' apparently without being acquainted with its previous use by

Earnshaw and Stokes. Rankine, also, has used it in his paper on plane

water lines,^ where it enters as expressing the flow aci'oss any line.

In the paper above referred to, Clebsch had reduced the case for

steady motion to one of making the energy a minimum, but he had not

succeeded in obtaining an analogous result for non-steady motion. This

question he takes up in a paper, published in Crelle,^ ' Ueber die Integra-

tion der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen,' but attacks the problem in a quite

Hedifferent but original way.    introduces three functions, (j), 4^, m, so

We have now to refer to a remarkable simplification introduced into the

equations of motion in the ' Lagrangian ' form, where the position of any
particle at any time is sought in terms of the time and its initial position.

This was effected by Weber ^ in 1868. Integrating the equation by

parts with respect to the time between the limits o and t, they take the

lines. It is clear then that these surfaces must form two families which

contain the same particles of fluid at all times. The general problem of

taking as independent variables any system of surfaces always contain-

ing the same particles was taken up by Mr. Hill,^ apparently without a

knowledge of Clebsch's researches. He starts by taking any three in-

dependent sets of such surfaces (say P,Q,E,) which must bg three inde-

pendent solutions of the equation

Transforming the equations to independent variables P.Q.R, and taking
the circulation round elementary circuits, he shows that

Combining this with the expression for the vortex -^V (v'W-v4') given

above, and limiting Q.R to the case where they give the vortex filaments,

AHelmholtz' law follows as a case of a more general theorem.                    special

case of the preceding was worked out by Mr. Craig- towards the end of

the same year. The case only of steady motion is considered and that

only when of the three surfaces two are chosen to give the vortex lines.

As this part of the paper is almost the same as Hill's, modified so as

to leave out of consideration the unsteadiness of the motion, there is

no need to refer to it further here. The latter part of the same paper

will be noticed again under vortex motion.

   A most powerful method of attacking particular problems in fluid

motion is that known as the method of images. The conception appears

to have been first introduced by Stokes^ in 1843, in considering the

problem of the motion of a sphere in presence of a plane, but the theory

received no extension until Thomson's discovery of the electrical image

of a point of electricity in presence of a conducting sphere again drew

Stokes' attention to the matter, the result being a short note in the

' British Association Heport ' for 1847, in which he gives the image in a

sphere of a doublet whose axis passes through the centre of the sphere.

The general cases for a source of fluid and for a doublet with its axis in

any direction have been published by the Avriter,* and for a vortex by

Mr. Lewis. ^ The images in two dimensions for a circle have been long

known, but I have not been able to discover by whom first used. The

images for ellipses are also known.^ These will be referred to again

under the head of special problems.

    Befoi-e going further, it may be well to refer here to one or two points

in the history which are of importance and which have not yet been

touched upon. It has been shown how Clebsch deduced a maximum and

minimuna theorem on the equations of motion ; but the first, so far as I

am aware, to give any such general theorem peculiar to hydrodynamics,

' It is not stated quite correctly, as he sjDeaks of the prodvict of a vector and an

area being constant, instead of the tensor of a vector.

was Tbomson,' in 1849. The theorem as enunciated by him is, ' If the

bounding surfece of a liquid primitively at rest be made to A'ary in a

given arbitrary manner, the vis-viva of the entire liquid at each instant

will be less than it would be if the liquid had any other motion consistent

with the given motion of the bounding surface.' This theorem was

afterwards, in Thomson and Tait's 'Natural Philosophy,' extended to
dynamical problems in general. From this theorem, he states three

-- + +corollaries (1) The condition that udx vdij lodz must be a complete

differential is, in addition to the kinematical conditions, sufficient to

determine the motion. (2) The motion of the fluid at any time is inde-

pendent of the preceding motion, and depends solely on the given form

and normal motion of the bounding surface at the instant. (3) If the
bounding surface be brought to rest, the liquid will at the same instant

be reduced to rest. None of the theorems contained in these corollaries

were new. But the first corollary forms, I believe, the first definite proof

of the uniqueness of the solution obtained when the fluid is irrotational

and the normal motion of the surface is given. Former writers, thouo-h

convinced of its truth, had not succeeded in arriving at a formal proof

of it. In 1843, Stokes''^ writes that it is a recognised principle, that

when a problem is determinate, any solution which satisfies all the

                   the                        problem                                         and then states that
--requisite conditions is solution of the                                                  ;

the problem is determinate a proof based on experiment. The second

and third are also proved by Stokes in the same paper, and by Cauchy.^

The theorem that the velocity cannot be a maximum at any point of the

fluid was given by Maxwell* in a Senate House paper, and in his

lectures at Cambridge, though not stated in the hydrodynamical form,

Thomson also gives the now Avell-known application of Green's theorem

to the energy of irrotational motion within a boundary. The analogous

expressions for the energy, and its variation with the time in the case of

rotational motion, were given by Helmholtz in his vortex paper, and for

irrotational motion in multiply continuous space by Thomson.-^

During the last forty years, without doubt, the most important

addition to the theory of fluid motion has been in our knowledo-e of

the properties of that kind of motion where the velocities cannot be

expressed by means of a potential. Certainly, before this we knew some-

thing. Stokes' researches had shown the kinematical nature of the

-- --motion the rotation of its small parts '' and we also knew that it

    As to the true nature of this rotation, reference may be made to a discussion

between Helmholtz and Bertrand in the Comptes Hendus, Ixvi. and Ixvii (1868).
Bertrands objection reduced itself to a question of the use of the word rotation!

could not be set up or destroyed by a system of conservative forces ; bnt
this was almost all. Helmholtz first ^ave ns clear conceptions in liis

well-known paper' referred to above. He introduced tlie idea of vortex-

lines (curves whose tangents at any point' coincide in direction with the

axis of rotation at that point), and vortex- filaments (the portions of fluid
in a tube whose surface is generated by vortex-lines passing through an

--infinitely small curve). Helmholtz' laws are then proved (1) Each vortex

remains continually composed of the same elements of fluid. (2) The pro-
duct of the section at any point of a filament into the magnitude of the
rotation at the point is constant for all time and for all points of the
filament. Also (3) a vortex-filament must be closed or have its ends on
the boundary of the surface. The next part of the paper is devoted to
finding expressions for the velocity when the rotations at every point of
the fluid are known ; in other words, to finding solutions of the four

differential equations.^

supposed existing between the given quantities t,, »;, c. The introduction
of the functions L, M, N, has been noticed above. It is shown that they
are the potential functions of distributions of magnetic matter, whose
density at any point is £/27r, ?y/2T, e/27r, and thence that each rotating
element of fluid (a) implies in each other element (b) of the same
fluid a velocity which follows the same law as the fori;e exerted on
a particle of magnetism at (h) by the element of an electric current at (a),

in the axis of rotation.

     In the same paper, examples are given of the motion of the fluid due
to infinite straight vortices and to circular vortex-filaments. It must be
remembered that the results here given refer to the cyclic motion of the
fluid as determined by the supposed distribution of magnetic matter, and
do not give the most general motion possible. Helmholtz shows that
this motion in the case of straight parallel vortices is such that, regarding

their strengths as positive or negative masses, according as they rotate in

one or the other direction, their centres of gravity remain at rest. When

two vortices are of equal and opposite strength they move forward
together with constant velocity and at a constant distance. This solves
also the case where a single vortex is in a fluid bounded by an infinite
plane, to which it is parallel. The results for circular rings are more

complicated, and since in nature the section mu^st be finite, an indeter-
minateness enters on account of the distribution of rotation within it.

The problem to determine this distribution, so that the motion shall be

steady and the ring remain of the same mean size and shape, is one of

extreme difficulty and has not yet been successfully attempted. If we

regard a ring whose axial section is small, compared with the radius

of the axis, ho shows that a single such ring moves forward, with

approximate constant aperture, with very great velocity in the direction

of the fluid motion through the ring itself. When there are two on the

same axis, and rotating in the same direction, they travel in the same

direction and thread each other alternately. If they have equal and

opposite rotations, they approach one another indefinitely, and widen

indefinitely as they do so. This is the case of a ring whose plane is

parallel to an infinite rigid plane in a fluid. But it is to be remarked

that, as stated thus, it is only partially true. This is clearly only the case

when the fluid motions through the rings are directed towards each

other. If they are directed from each other, they will move from each

other, contracting as they do so to a certain limiting radias, which is

determinate in terms of any simultaneous radius, strength, and distance.'

The permanent character of vortex motion in a perfect fluid has

suggested to Sir W. Thomson^ a theory of the constitution of matter in

which atoms consist of small vortex-rings, whose axes may be knotted

into any degree of multiple continuity, the bekuottedness (as Tait calls

it) ^ being a permanent character of the atom. The lines of its spectrum

would thus depend on the vibrations of the atom, either of the section

or axis. In the paper in which this speculation was brought forward,

Thomson notes how the motion of the fluid may be set up by a surface

impulse over a diaphragm, across the opening of the ring. The ring will

carry forward with it a mass of fluid in irrotational motion, and the

whole impulse of the motion is equal to the resultant impulse on the

diaphragm. These ideas of the impulse of the motion, and the genera-

tion of cyclic motion, were worked out more fully in a paper presented

to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which only a fi'agmenf has been

published. In the latter part of this paper, tJae principles of vortex

motion are developed in a quite diflerent way from that followed by

Helmholtz, viz., from the fundamental proposition that the ' circulation '

in a circuit in the fluid is the same for all circuits which can be con-

tinuously deformed into one another without leaving the irrotational

part of the fluid. From this all the known theorems are easily deduced.

Amongst fresh results may be mentioned the proof that the motion of a

+liquid moving irrotationally within an n 1 ply connected space is

determinate when the normal velocity at eveiy point of the boundary and

the values of the circulation in the n circuits are given                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and the theorem

the surface over any surface whose boundary is the curve. This gives at
once Helmholtz's theorem that the surface-integral of the same quantity
over any closed surface is zero. Looking at the general question of the
production of cyclic motion, and noticing that the diaphragm closing the

aperture of a ring may be of any shape, it is easy to see that the impulse

of the motion of a closed filament of infinitely small section is the

=resultant of a uniform distribution of pressure ( cyclic constant) over

three plane areas which are the projections of the core of the ring on
any three planes at right angles.

     The general question of the steady motion and stability of vortex-

rings has also been considered by Sir W. Thomson in a paper before the

same Society, of which, unfortunately, only an abstract ' has been published.
The theory is based on the proposition (only to be stated for its truth to
be evident,) that if when the vorticity ^ and impulse are given the kinetic

energy is a maximum or minimum, the motion is steady and stable ; if it
is a maximum-minimum (minimax), the motion is steady, but may be

stable or unstable. Unfortunately, the simple circular Helmholtz ring has

its energy a minimax, so that from this it is not possible to rigorously

decide the question of its stability for all possible displacements, although

when the aperture is not too small compared with the section of the core,
experiment would lead us to believe that it is stable. For displacements,
symmetrical about its axis, it is clear that for some determinate distribu-
tion of the vorticity the energy must be a maximum, and the motion
stable. Very interesting too are the illustrations given of the steady

motion of non-plane vortex-filaments. When the number of twists in

the axis of a vortex is large, the core is approximately a helix wound on a
circular tore, and approximate expressions are obtained in this case for
the radii of the axis and section of the tore in terms of the number of
twists, the circulation and the components of the given impulse.

     The method inti-oduced of considering the question of stability as a

problem of maximum and minimum energy enables us to arrive at many

general results which at first sight appear very remarkable, as, for
example, the complete annulment of the energy in certain cases by opera-

tions on the boundary alone. An extremely interesting illustration of the
transformation of a vortex motion with stability of maximum energy to

one with stability of minimum energy by operations on the boundary
alone, which withdraw energy, was given by the same author before

the British Association at its meeting at Swansea^ in 1880. Approach-
ing the subject from another point of view Lamb** had proved that in
steady motion it is possible to draw a system of surfaces, each of which
is covered by a network of vortex lines and stream lines, and that
between any two near surfaces of the system ^ w sin 6. v is constant
where q denotes the velocity along a stream line, w is the rotation, d the

angle between q and w, and v is the normal distance at the point of the
two surfaces.

     The problem of the most general vibration of a straight columnar
vortex of constant vorticity has been treated by Thomson.' If fluid be

revolving irrotationally in a fixed cylinder, there -will be a cylindric space

along the axis, either empty, or filled with fluid in rotational motion. In

the former case, suppose the surface disturbed so that the generating
lines and normal sections are deformed into harmonic curves of difFei'ent
Avave-lengths, the wave-lengths of the cross section being of course sub-

multiples of the undisturbed circumference. Then Thomson shows

--that two velocities of propagation are possible, of the form angular

=velocity iw {i i: s/Nyji where iv is the angular velocity of points on the

inside surface of the fluid, i is the number of crests in a normal section,

Nand depends only on the number of crests in unit length along a

generating line. One set, therefore, travels in the same direction as the
rotation, the other in the same or opposite direction, according to the
magnitude of N. For the special case, where the containing vessel is
infinitely large, and the distance between the crests on a generating line

large compared with the circumference of the hollow N=^l -}- Jc- ('IISO
-- log Ic) where h denotes this ratio. Here the slow wave for the case

=i l travels in the reverse direction to the rotation. Of more importance

than the foregoing is the case of the small vibrations of a vortex column
in an infinite irrotationally moving liquid. The periodic times for given
harmonic initial disturbance are given by the roots of a transcendental
equation, which has an infinite number of roots. This is much simplified

when. the disturbance is only longitudinal. When the distance between

the velocity of propagation corresponding to the smallest root is about f

of the circular velocity at the surface of the vortex. When there is no

--longitudinal displacement, the angular velocity of sectional waves is (i 1)

X ang. vel. of the vortex, where i denotes as before the number of crests
on the circumference. The time of pulsation of a hollow vortex enclosed

in a flexible cylindrical shell, over whose surface the pressure is constant
has been given by the writer.

     Mr. F. D. Thomson ^ has proved an interesting theorem relating to a

steady motion within cylindrical surfaces. Suppose a cylindrical vessel,
of any sectional form, and the contained fluid to be rotating as a rigid body,
and that the vessel itself is suddenly brought to rest, then the resulting
motion of the fluid will be steady. Another proof has been given by
Stokes,* but it is easily seen to be a consequence of the uniform distribution
of vorticity and Helmholtz' laws.

     Quite lately, two papers have been published respectively by Craig ^
and Rowland^ almost simultaneously. They both seem to have been
struck by the fact that if the same operations are performed on the com-
ponents of rotation that are performed on the components of velocity to
deduce the rotations, functions are obtained which satisfy the equation of

the n th order of motion. If the functions of the n th order are expressible
by means of a scalar potential, then the functions of a higher order do not
occur. Looked at from the point of view as an investigation of the dis-
tribution of vorticity in a fluid motion whose vector-potential is given, it

may be possibly of some value, but I cannot help thinking that both

      In a fluid in motion the pressure is, in general, given as a
continuous function of position, and may, therefore, so far as the
analytical treatment is concerned, become zero or negative. But, in
this case, clearly, the fluid will cease to be continuous, and free
surfaces will be set up inside the fluid,^ or surfaces on the two sides of
which the tangential motions are different. It is curious that so evident
a fact as this seems not to have been noticed by mathematicians in general

until it was pointed out by Helmholtz,^ in 1868, though Stokes"* had drawn

attention to it twenty years before. He had already, in his before-

inentioned paper on vortex motion, considered, in passing, the case where
the tangential motions are diSerent on the two sides of a surface, and

had shown how the motions ought to be represented mathematically, by

supposing the surface a continuous vortex-sheet, the vortex-axis at any
point being parallel to the resultant of the two tangential velocities. In
the later paper he points out that wherever fluid is flowing across a sharp
edge, the velocity at the point, on the ordinary theory, would be infinite,
and the pressure negative infinity, consequently a surface of separation
be established. Tliis would also be the case with gases; but a
curious exception occurs, provided they obeyed Boyle's law alone, and
did not change their temperature on account of change of volume.

Here log p takes the place of p, and, clearly, log p may become negative

without necessitating a break of continuity in the fluid. This paper is
particularly important, as containing the first successful attempt at the
solution of a problem where discontinuity ensues. It is evident that
along any surface of discontinuity the pressures on both sides must be
the same ; and if the fluid on one side be at rest, under the action of no

- Thus consider a sphere in motion, in an infinite non-gravitating fluid, whose

surface is under a constant pressure. The fluid will move in the well-known manner,

and the sphere with constant velocity, provided the velocity be not greater than

'/2j)jp. If it is greater, there will be a hollow formed in the rear until the sphere
has been reduced to this limiting velocity.

along the surface must bo constant, and, therefore, also the velo-

an infinite conducting sheet, in which two parallel non-conducting lines are
+ --drawn stretching from the points (-- A,
                                Att) to               go . It is, therefore,

the solution, so far as the equation of continuity is concerned, for fluid

flowing from between two infinite parallel walls into an infinite fluid ; but

the conditions at the mouth break up the fluid. He then, by adding

= ±(T -H Ti, a function of ^ -f- \lii, to the former expression, determines ff, r,
so that when xp  w, the velocity may be constant along the free

surface. The value obtained is

+ = -- + -- +a ri Ai [\/ { 2 exp f 4^1 exp 2 (f \pi)}

                 + +2 sin ~^{i\/^ exp (<j>  '/'i)}]-

+It is then easy to show that the expression for x yi gives the motion

from an infinite fluid into a canal with parallel walls, extending to infinity
in the negative direction. At a great distance from the entrance, in the
canal, the fluid tends to flow in a stream whose breadth is half that of

the canal.

     In Helmholtz' example it seems a happy chance by which a suitable
function is found. KirchhoS"' remedied this want of method, to some
extent, in a paper which contains several further examples of discontinuous

+ +motion. Denoting by z the complex x yi, and hy w, (p xpi, the

-- =conditions are for the rigid boundaries, \p constant ; and, for the free

=boundary, \p same constant, and the velocity constant. To this end he

puts

                                            1 and        1. For these

values, then,

or the velocity is constant, and equal to unity. The equation in dz/dw
will always give to as a many-valued function of z ; now the region of z
is the space occupied by the fluid, and since in this space one branch of

the function must not pass over into another, the region must be so

chosen that within it / (w) is single-valued, or, if it is not so, it must be

it/ (w) must nowhere be infinite. In this case the lines i// will be stream

lines, parts of which form rigid walls, and the other parts free surfaces.

In his treatise on mechanics,^ he has introduced the subject in a slightly

different and improved manner. The dz/dw of the foregoing represents

the inverse velocity at the point z ; hence, along a straight rigid boundary,

=c dz/dw is constant in direction, whilst along a free surface it is

constant in magnitude ; in other words, as z moves along a bounding

to the rigid walls ; and part of a circle, which corresponds to the free

--surface. For the region of to are taken two constant values of \p, and ^

varying between oo and 4- oo. The boundary of c chosen is a crescent,
one of whose arcs has its centre at the origin, and is to correspond to

the free surfaces. Marking on this the points which correspond to the

infinite branches of the walls and free surfaces respcctivel}', the points

of the crescent will correspond to the ends of the walls where e changes

from a given direction to a given magnitude. The problem now is to

find the relation between e and w, that the regions of c, w may be

transformed into one another, so as to be similar in their corresponding

small elements. Several extremely interesting problems are solved in
these two papers.'

In one case only KirchhoS" determined the pressure exerted per imit of

length of an infinitely long plane strip immersed perpendicular to a

stream, but this is the only practical application he makes of his results.

Lord Rayleigh^ has deduced several most interesting conclusions by

means of Kirchhoif's formulas. He finds expressions for the moan

pressure on a lamina held obliquely in a stream, and the position of the

centre of pressure. The distance of the centre of pressure from the

+middle is ^ Z cos o / (4                                                                           tt sin a), where a is the inclination of the
=plane of the lamina to the direction of the stream. For a
                                                                                                                                                      ; this

divides the breadth in the ratio 11:5; consequently, a blade swinging

about an axis nearer the front edge than 5/11 the breadth will be in

stable equilibrium                                                                                  if further  from  the  front  edge,  the  stable  positions
                                                                                                 ;

of equilibrium will be inclined at angles o, on either side, given by the

above formula ; whilst, if pivoted at the centre, the only position is

perpendicular to the stream. He finds that the greatest pressure transverse

to the stream is for an inclination nearly equal to 39".
     The problem of the vena contracta is a very old one, and is a case

of the discontinuous motion we have been noticing. Hanlon^ and

Maxwell'' have applied the principle of momentum to its consideration
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the former deduced that the contraction must be '5, whilst the latter

showed that it must slightly exceed this. Rayleigh,^ by slightly varying

the circumstances, and supposing the fluid issuing from a nozzle of

sufBcient length projecting into the fluid, has deduced that, for this case,

the coefficient of contraction is almost exactly -5. Considei'ing also the

case of fluid issuing from a finite cylinder through a similar nozzle, he

has shown that the section of the nozzle is a harmonic mean between the

sections of the cylinder and the jet.

It is by no means easy to illustrate rigorously, by experiment, all the

results deduced from the foregoing theory ; for, apart from the extreme
instability which is a general characteristic of jets and allied motions,

other disturbing influences arise from capillary action, in the case of jets

into another fluid or vacuum, which tends to break up a column into
drops, and from fluid friction, even in the case of two portions of the
same fluid moving past each other, where the influence of surface-tension

would not be felt. Experimentally the subject has been very fully

investigated,' but no attempt lias been made towards a general theoretical

investigation of the stability of such motions. Lord Rayleigh has,

indeed, considered some general aspects of the qaestion in two important

papers, in the ' Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, '^ some

of the results of which it may be well to state here. In the first, he

shows that, in the case of cylindrical columns, the disturbing cause due

to surface-tension lias most efiect when, for harmonic disturbances, the

ratio of  wave-length to diameter is about 4-508                                                                                                                                                    and also  determines the

rate of falling away from steadiness for small harmonic disturbances in

the cases of plane and cylindrical sheets of discontinuity. The results

lead to the supposition, as is pointed out in the second paper, that the

sensitiveness of sensitive jets would increase indefinitely with the pitch,
which is not, in general, true. The explanation he finds in the operation

of the viscosity of the fluid, which, for water, is found to be such that, if

a plane surface of discontinuity existed at any moment, then, after the

lapse of one second, there would be a layer of transition, consisting of

vortex motion, of a thickness of half a centimeter. In this paper the

fluid is treated as frictionless, but the jets as containing vortex motion,
and in two dimensions. For a layer of given thickness, with velocities

V --Vand on the two sides, and uniform vorticity between, the motion is

unstable when the wave-length of disturbance is great in comparison

with the breadth, and stable when the wave-length is small. For a jet

in fluid, at rest, with its centre moving with velocity V, and velocity

decreasing uniformly to zero on either side, the motion is stable for

symmetrical disturbances, or when the wave-length is small compared

with the breadth of the jet, and unstable when it is great. In general,

in a case where the velocity increases continually or decreases continually

between the fixed boundaries of the fluid, a jet will be stable.

Another kind of discontinuous motion, viz., the propagation of a

shock through a slightly compressible liquid,, has been treated by

Christoffel,3 in a manner founded on that of Riemann. In such a case

there will be a surface of discontinuity in the fluid, which moves forward,
and such that the pressure, density, and velocity are different on the

two sides. If w be the normal velocity of progression of a point of the

surface, ii,, pj, tig? P2> ^^^ normal velocities and densities of the fluid on

These equations are made linear on the supposition that the compres-

quantities of the order 1/a, and sQi are neglected. It follows easily that

every point of the surface progresses with a velocity a, so that different

positions of the surface at different times form a system of parallel surfaces.

Supposing the hydrodynamical equations to hold on both sides and up

to the surface of discontinuity, he then shows how to determine the

part of the paper reflection at a rigid wall is considered. Rankine ' has

also touched on the same theory.

                   (d) General Theory of the Motion of Solids in Fluid.

     Already, in 1843, had Stokes^ proved that if a body symmetrical with
respect to two planes at right angles to each other moved in a fluid
parallel to their intersection under tbe action of no forces the resultant

--pressure of the fluid on it would vanish, provided the body and fluid were

originally at rest in other words, that there is no I'otational motion in the
fluid. If, on the contrary, its motion Averc accelerated, it would experience
a resultant pressure equal to n x acceleration x mass of fluid displaced
by the body, where n depends alone on the /or)??- of the body and not its size.

A special case of this was also proved in 1854 by Hoppe,^ apparently

without knowledge of Stokes' paper. The case considered was that of
a solid of revolution, the equation of whose meridian section could be
thrown into a particular form.'* The fact that in every body there are
three directions which 230ssess the same property was explicitly stated
and proved by Kirchhoff in his paper referred to below.

     The starting point for the investigation of the motion here considered
was given by the publication in 1867 of Thomson and Tait's ' Natural
Philosophy.' Here the authors applied the Lagrangian equations of
motion of a dynamical system directly to the energy of the fluid, ex-
pressed as a quadi'atic function of the component velocities of the body,

which, referred to axes fixed in the body, has constant coefficients. By

this means the general properties of the motion of a solid of revolution
in a fluid, and moving in one plane, are deduced with the greatest ease.

In the general case there are twenty -one constant coefficients which may
be supposed known, and may either be found by analysis (theoretically

at least) or by experiment (just as coefficients of self- and mutual in-
duction in the case of electric currents) by finding the impulses necessary
to generate the unit velocities and their combinations two-and-two. The
general theory of the impulse as applied to fluid motion has been very

fully developed by Sir W. Thomson^ in his paper on vortex motion, before

referred to.

   We have already seen (p. 4) how he has shown that when the

motion can be produced from rest by application of forces to the solids

alone, Lagrange's equations are applicable directly to tlio expression for

Nowthe energy.           in this, the coefficients are, in general, functions of the

angular co-ordinates of the body referred to fixed axes. If the energy

be expressed in terms of the velocities referred to axes fixed in the body,

the expression has constant coefficients. It is therefore advantageous

to determine the form of the equations of motion when the energy is so

expressed. This had been effected by him in 1858,' but was not pub-

lished until 1871.^ At the same time also, the form of the equation for

the motion of a single solid, with any number of apertures in it and

cyclic motion through them, a case in which the conditions of direct

applicability of Lagi-ange's equations are not satisfied, were deduced.

When there are several solids, of which some at least have apertures, the

equations are naturally more complicated. The equations of motion for

this case were  published^ by the same author in March,  1872                          they have
                                                                                    ;

also been proved in a different manner in the new edition of Thomson

and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy,' and have been already referred to.

     I adduce here some of the chief results of the above analysis as

developed by Sir W. Thomson. In the ' Natural Philosophy ' was con-

sidered the case of the motion of a solid of revolution in an infinite fluid

Aso as always to keep its axis in one plane.       certain fixed point in the

axis (the centre of reaction) determinate when the form and distribution

of mass in the body is known, moves in a sinuous line cutting the line of

resultant impulse at equal intervals, and the body swings about the

centre of reaction according to the law of the quadrantal pendulum. If

A, B are the impulses necessary to produce unit velocity along and per-

pendicular to the axis, and jx the impulsive couple to produce unit rotation,

then the length of the simple pendulum keeping time with the swinging

of the body is gnAB/E,^(A -- B), ^ being the resultant impulsive force of

the motion. This is on the supposition that there is no perforation with

cyclic motion through it. An example of this latter was solved in the

same manner for a circular tore with no rotation round its axis, in the

paper ' On the motion of free solids through a liquid.' Here, when the

ring is projected with a rotation round a diameter, its axis oscillates

rotationally according to the law of a horizontal magnetic needle carry-

ing a bar of soft iron rigidly attached to it parallel to the magnetic axis.

In the same paper Thomson has also treated the question of the general

motion of a solid of ' complete isotropy with helicoidal quality.'* The

point P about which the body is isotropic moves uniformly in a circle or

spiral so as to keep at a constant distance from the axis of the impulse,
and the components of angular velocity round any three rectangular axes

are constant.

     In the ' vortex motion ' he has shown, from general reasoning, that if
a solid moves from a great distance past a fixed obstacle to a great

the fixed obstacle according as the direction of the impulse is in the same

direction as, or the opposite to, that of translation. This follows at once

after it is proved that the effect of the fixed obstacle is to add an impul-

sive component towards itself. In the paper which treats of polycyclic

motion with several solids is given an example of a sphere moving in a

fluid in which there are infinitely fine immovable curves round which

polycyclic motion exists. Here the sphere moves as a material particle,

I have thought it well to refer to those papers of Thomson's together,

as they form a connected series, although between their publications im-

portant essays have appeared from other investigators. The first of these

requiring mention is Kirchhoff, who taking up the question of the general

motion of a body of revolution as treated in Thomson and Tait applied

the same methods to extend their results when the motion is not con-

fined to one plane. His investigation^ was published in March, 1870.

He deduced by analysis alone the Eulerian^ form of the equations of

motion in the same form as Thomson's. Taking the origin at the centre

of reaction he obtains equations for the velocities and the co-ordinates

which enable them to be expressed as elliptic functions of the time.

Considering more closely the case already solved in Thomson and Tait's

treatise, he finds exphcitly the velocities in terms of the time, and ex-

presses the constants in terms of the constants of the kinetic energy and

the initial motion. Two cases pi'esent themselves which dej^end on the

energy-constants, and each of these subdivides into two subcases accord-

ing to the initial motion. These may be expressed thus. If it requires

a less impulse to produce unit velocity along the axis than ijeiyeiuUcular

to it, then the velocity along the former is expressible by means of the

Bsn functions and vice versa,. Calling the larger and smaller impulses A,

respectively, each case divides into two subcases, according as the ratio

of the energy due to rotation bears to the energy due to the other velocity

--a greater or less ratio than (A B)/B which corresponds to the case of

the rotation and velocity being expressed by dn, en respectively, or vice

versa. Kirchhoff finds also that it is possible to project a solid of revolu-

--tion with rotation round a line perpendicular to its axis, so as to describe

a cu'cular helix a result, which by Thomson's theory of the impulse, is

at once seen to be true. In the same volume Kirchhoff^ considered the

forces between any two infinitely thin rings with circular section through
which cyclic motion is taking j^lace, and proved that the apparent forces
between them are equal to those which would exist between them if they

were conductors and electric currents flowed along them. The same

 question was takeu up by Boltzmann' later, wlio has considered the case

of non-cii-cular section. He notices that Kirchhoff's analogy is not

 exact, as the forces due to the motion of the rings vanish in the case of

 fluid motion.

      Kirchhoff's investigation of the solid of revolution was completed

 in 1877 by Kopcke,^ who did for the general case of a solid of revolution

 what Kirchhoft' had done for Thomson and Tait's solution. He succeeded

in expressing the elements of the motion and the position at any moment
by rueans of the elliptic and 9 functions, using a quadric transformation

 to reduce the functions in «, the velocity along the axis, to the canonical

form. In this also two chief cases occur distinguished as in the simpler
case mentioned above. The same end was also attained by a somewhat

 different process by Greeuhill.^

     In the case of any solid whatever, we obtain at once three integrals in

the form of constant energy, constant impulsive force, and constant

impulsive couple. Clebsch noticed that if a fourth integral could be

obtained, a fifth could be at once deduced by the principle of the last
multiplier ; and the last integral, giving the value of t, be then found by
quadratures. In the ' Mathematische Annalen '* for 1871, soon after

Kirchhoff's paper, he set himself the problem to discover when the equa-

tions admitted («) of a linear integral, (/3) of a quadric integral not com-
pounded of the first three integrals. Instead of the velocities, he takes

the momenta for dependent variables. Writing x-^, x^, x-^, for the
component impulsive forces of the motion and y,, 1/2, ijs, for the com-

+ponent impulsive couples, the energy can be expressed in the form Tj
+T2 T3 where T,, T3 are quadric functions of the (x) and (y) respec-

tively, and T 2 contains only products of an x into a y, which he proves
may by a proper choice of the origin be such that the coefficients of X; yj

and Xj yi are the same. For a linear integral the condition found is that

The case where the last condition is satisfied has been investigated by-

--Weber ' when the impulse of the motion reduces to a single force in other

words, when the state of motion can be produced by a single blow
applied to a point rigidly connected with the body. Out of the sixteen

Theta functions of the first order of two variables, it is possible, in several
ways, to choose nine, whose ratios to a tenth, multiplied by proper con-
stants, are suitable to express the direction cosines of one set of rectan-
gular axes to another. "Weber shows that, taking the two variables to be

+linear functions of the time a t (d, a^ t +/3i, and those nine ratios to

represent the direction cosines of the axes fixed in the body, to the axes
fixed in the space, it is possible, if Clebsch's last condition above is satis-

fied, to determine the constants, so that three other ratios may represent

the rotations about the set of axes fixed in the body, and the remaining
three the. rotations about the axes fixed in space, provided the motion is
such that there is no impulsive couple. There remain four constants to
be determined by the initial conditions, viz., two relations between three
moduli of the Theta functions and the two constants /3 /3p Four cases
occur as in the previous investigations, which depend on the initial state.

These are distinguished in the latter part of the paper. He also treats

the equations in another way by direct integration by means of hyper-

elliptic integrals.

     The motions of a solid about a fixed point in fluid under the action of
no forces, and about a fixed axis under the action of gravity, have been

investigated by Michaelis.^

     In a remarkably suggestive paper in the ' Proceedings of the London

Mathematical Society,'^ Lamb has applied Ball's theory of screws to the

question of the steady motion of any solid in a fluid. It is easy to see
that there are a simply-infinite system of steady motions, each being a screw
motion, whose axis lies on a certain skew surface. The axis of each
screw must coincide with the axis of the generating wrench, but their

pitches are not necessarily the same. If the ratio of the impulsive force
to the rotation set up is given, there are three screws of steady motion

perpendicular to each other, though not necessarily intersecting. Amongst
the infinite system of permanent screws, it is possible to choose sets of
six mutually conjugate screws amongst which there is one set which

contains three of infinite pitch (which correspond to the three steady
translations), and three others which are such that the necessary gene-
rating wrenches have zero pitch, i.e. reduce to impulsive couples. This
latter set of three is important, as by its means it is possible to construct

the motion when the generating wrench reduces to any couple whatever.
The following is Lamb's method of representing the motion. The three

sets of screws just mentioned do not in general intersect, but their axes

lie along the alternate edges of a parallelopiped. Take the centre of

this parallelopiped, and call it O. Then the motion of the body is

compounded of the motion of O, and a motion about 0. Describe

about 0, as centre, a certain ellipsoid, which, as in Poinsot's

representation, gives the motion relative to  by rolling on a

plane with angular velocity proportional to the instantaneous axis 01.

The motion of is then represented by drawing round another deter-

OMminate quadric. Suppose 01 cuts the quadric in P, and   is the

perpendicular from on the tangent plane at P ; then the motion is

completely represented by supposing the Poinsot ellipsoid and plane to
OMmove bodily in the direction of
                                   with a velocity proportional to

01 (OP.      OM).  For particular forms of the body this naturally
          /

simplifies very much; for instance, in the case of an isotropic helicoid,

any screw through O is a permanent one. The motion is stable about

two of these fundamental screws and unstable about the third. Some of

Lamb's results have since been obtained by Craig.' The steady motion

of a solid of revolution has also been treated by Greenhill,- who has given

an expression for the least rotation about the axis of a prolate solid of

revolution that it may keep its point in front. An investigation similar

to Greenhill's was given by Craig ^ about the same time.

     The general theory of the motion of more than one body in a fluid has

not hitherto received much attention. Many special problems have been

solved, especially the case of two or more spheres by several writers. But

these, beyond those referred to above, will best be noticed later under

special problems. Most of the qualitative results obtained for spheres, no

Wedoubt hold good for solids in general.  may then expect that bodies

vibrating in a fluid will appear to act on one another with forces varying

according to inverse powers of the distance higher than the second, while

pulsating bodies (or bodies changing their volume periodically) will have

the chief part of their action proportional to the inverse square of the

distance.

                                                   (e) Viscous Fluids.

     The general theory of viscous fluids presents diSicuIties which can
scarcely even yet be said to be settled. The equations of motion have not
the same degree of certainty as in the case of perfect fluids, partly on
account of the difiiculty of finding a satisfactory theory on which friction
is to be explained, and partly on the difficulty, as Stokes has pointed out,
of connecting the oblique pressures on a small area with the difl^erentials

of the velocities. In the last report to the Association Professor Stokes

has given a clear description of the various methods by which, up to 1846,
Navier, Poisson, St. Venant, and he himself had attacked the problem.
Since then several others have investigated the subject with results most
of which can be expressed in (what may be called) the typical form

where denotes the cubical compression. In Stokes' form, which is that

Agenerally received, =:; 3 B. O. E. Meyer ' (1861) assumes tliafc the

friction on a small plane in a given direction in the plane is proportional
to the rate of variation perpendicular to the plane of the component of
velocity in the given direction, whilst there is a normal part, proportional
to the rate of variation perpendicular to the plane, of the component per-
pendicular to the plane. This is not so stated in his preliminary hy-
pothesis, but is vyhat his initial expressions imply. Considering then a
small parallelepiped dx dy dz, he arrives at the above form of equation if

B is put zero, which agrees with the results found by previous investiga-

tors for incompressible fluids only. Stefan ^ (1862) applies directly the
methods of elasticity to a small tetrahedron treating the forces as functions
of the nine differential coefficients of u v w, and shows, as in the theory of
elastic solids, that the forces are of the form

He now attempts to find a relation between X and fx on the following

hypothesis. Drawing a small plane through the direction of the velocity

at any point, then the friction must fall in this plane and be parallel to the

=direction of the velocity. From this it results that A. o. Stokes' cor-

responding assumption was that a uniform expansion of any element does

=Stefan's equations then give, in the typical form, B o. From a totally

different point of view has Maxwell ^ approached the subject when the

fluid in question is gaseous. He bases his theory of viscosity on the

transference of momentum from one layer to another by the moving
particles of a gas, treating a gas according to the kinetic theory. He

obtains precisely the same expressions as Stokes. But this investigation

of Maxwell's is far more important from another point of view, in that he

attempts to express the unknown constant of internal friction in terms of

known properties of the meditim. The first attempt towards this was

made in his first paper'* on the kinetic theory of gases (1860), where on

the same bases as to the cause of friction he calculates the constant on the

supposition that the atoms of a gas are spherical and perfectly elastic,

with the result that the constant is proportional to the square root of the

absolute temperature and is independent of the density. O. E. Meyer

(1865) also arrived at similar results from the same data. But this does

not agree with experience, and Maxwell returns to the question again in

the paper already mentioned. The fact that the coefficient of viscosity

is independent of the density follows, whatever be the law of repulsion

between the particles, but the law of its variation with the temperature

depends on the law of force. Maxwell has chosen the inverse fifth, from

which it results that the coefficient is directly proportional to the absolute
A =temperature. Maxwell's result in this case is that
                                                                                        Jcp/p where Jc is a

constant depending only on the mass of a molecule and the force between

two molecules at unit distance. He has also given an expression for the

coefficient in a mixture of gases. Later experiments ' have shown that

the proportionality of the viscosity to absolute temperature docs not hold

for all gases. But Maxwell's work shows in any case that the connection
between them depends on the law of force, which is certainly a complicated
one, and not likely a priori to be the inverse fifth. Possibly for an
attractive force the viscosity might decrease with increase of temperature,
and if so would form an answer to Stefan's objection against making the
same explanation of friction a basis for a theory of the viscosity of liquids.

based on those of Stokes and St. Venant. Boussinesq ^ applies the

equations for an elastic solid directly.

whilst M. Kleitz,'* arriving at the same result as to the error of the ordinary

method of expressing the stresses, starts by supposing the constants to vary

for different small planes round a point, and tries to find the law of this

variation. Meyer ^ has also deduced equations of motion on the supposi-

tion that the action between two particles takes time to act.

In the ' Proceedings ' of the London Mathematical Society, Butcher ^

has attempted to develop a general theory which would comprise the

theory of elastic solids and perfect fluids as particular cases. He supposes

a body composed of small groups of molecules differing from one another,

which he divides into two classes : (A) which recover their original form

after being subjected to a strain less than a certain amount, and (B) those

Ain which this limiting strain is zero. When only groups are present we

proportions of elasticity, plasticity, and viscosity. For viscous fluids, or

where B groups only are present, the equations of motion are found on

the supposition that in any element the groups not thrown out behave
as elastic solids, whilst those thrown out behave as perfect fluids, i.e. are
only in a state of contraction or dilatation, and that a strain of the element
is the sum of the strains of the first as an elastic solid, and of the second
as dilatations. The final equations obtained are :

per unit of time to those not thrown out, and r, h are the rigidity and
resistance to dilatation respectively for the elastic groups. With I large

Mr. Butcher also forms the equations of motion for plastic solids on

similar principles.

     Bobylew ' has transformed Stokes' form of the equations of motion of

a viscous fluid to curvilinear co-ordinates, and has given expressions for the
pressure at any point of a viscous fluid, and its rate of variation with the
time, analogous to those given by Helmholtz for a perfect fluid. Simpler
proofs of the same formulse have been given since by Forsyth ^ and Craig.'

When the motion at the boundary is zero, the rate of variation takes the

simple form -- 4^  vrdxctydz, where lo is the rotation at the point

(x.y.z). It is clear, therefore, that with no motion at the boundary, or
in an infinite fluid at rest at infinity, there must be dissipation of the
energy of motion. Lipschitz * has also given expressions for the pressure
within a viscous fluid under the action of external and internal attraction.

     None of these theories can be regarded as perfectly satisfactory ; even
Stokes', which has been most generally accepted, introduces stresses,
whose appearance, simply on the theory of friction acting on the surface
of an element of fluid, it is difiicult to understand. Take, for instance,
the motion given by i(,=ax, v=0, iv=0 in a compressible fluid ; this gives

a stress, due to friction, perpendicular to a small plane parallel to the

plane of yz, where certainly no force can arise from friction, if we
suppose it to act on the surfaces only. The method employed by Max-

well, and suggested by Stefan afterwards for extension to liquids, would

seeni the more hopeful road, but we must wait until the motions of
the molecules of liquids are better understood than at present. On a

at least the ordinary equations give trustworthy results. Maxwell, in a

note published at the end of a paper by Rohrs ' has pointed out a way to
obtain limits of error in some particular cases by the consideration of

eiTor- forces.

     The question of steady motion in viscous fluids has been considered
by Craig,^ who has proved that if everywhere v^i\ V^*?, V^c ("T, v> c, being

+ +components of rotation) be zero, or in other words if x^hb dx ^'^v dy

X'-w dz be a perfect difi'erential, the motion is steady. In this paper
several interesting transformations of the equations of motion, and of

the dissipation function are given. Oberbeck^ had before this shown that
when the motion is very small and steady, the vanishing of \'^i, \'n, V^c is

a necessary consequence.

Helmholtz'' has given a method by which in certain cases the motions

of one fluid with given conditions can be directly deduced from that of

another fluid whose motion is geometrically similar. Denoting by u v %u

the velocities at time t, at the point (x.y.z) of a fluid whose density is p,
pressure p, and coefiicieut of viscosity ^j, and using dashed letters to
denote the same quantities for another fluid, he points out that when

there are no external forces the equations of motion are also satisfied by

lii=qfi,  pi=r p, U]^=nu,  &c.,  x^^qx/n,  &c. pi=n-rp + const.,                        n'^
                                                              ,
                                                                  ti=^qt I

where q. r. n are three constants, two of which, q. r, are determined by the

nature of the fluids, the other, n, is arbitrary for an incompressible fluid, but

for a compressible fluid n must be the ratio of the A'elocity of sound in the

second fluid to that in the first. In incompressible viscous fluids, in which

bodies are immersed, n will be determined by the ratios of the coefficients

of slipping at their surfaces. If this coefiicient is zero, or if there is no

viscosity, we may take into consideration the action of gravity, but then

n^=q. The resistances to the motion of similar bodies in the fluids are
in the ratio q^r : 1, whilst the rates of work done in overcoming the.se

resistances are as 7iq'^r : 1. Many interesting results flow at once from

the foregoing considerations, e.g., the fact that in waves on the surface of
a heavy incompressible fluid, the velocity of propagation of similar waves

in similar vessels is always, whatever their form, proportional to the square

root of the wave-length this follows at once by putting q=n^ whence
                                                                                                                                    ;

Xi:=n-x, t^-=nt. Helmholtz applies these considerations to the relations

between ships and their horse-power, birds and their muscular power,
and works out with numerical details the relations between ships and

similarly shaped balloons, with reference to volume, horse-power, and

tonnage. For these results the reader is referred to the paper itself.

The principle may be compared with that of Kewton's principle of
dynamical similitude. An example illustrating Helmholtz' results is

given by Rayleigh' on the analogy between the two dimensional vibra-
tions of air in a cylindrical tube of any section, and the liquid Avavea

contained in a vertical cylindrical vessel of the same section.

                            /. Waves hi Liquids.

The subject of waves was one which received much attention amongst

English mathematicians about the period between 1840 and 1850, and the
labours of Green, Kelland, Barnshaw, and Airy have been noticed by
Professor Stokes in the last report to the Association. Almost imme-

diately after this report he himself read a paper before the Cambridge
Philosophical Society 'On the Theory of Oscillatory Waves,' ^ in which
was investigated the form and properties of waves which are propagated

tvithout change of form and irrotationally. It appeared that with these
conditions^ given, to a given velocity of propagation corresponded one

definite form when the height is small compared with the wave-length,
                                                                      ;

the wave-form is the curve  of  sines but if                   the height  is  comparable with
                                                            ;

the wave-length this is not the case, but the crests of the waves are

steeper than the hollows, and this difference becomes more prominent

Athe shallower the fluid is.    curious result of the analysis is that the

fluid particles, in addition to a motion of oscillation have also a small one

of translation, which depends on the square of the ratio of the height to
wave-length, a result which Rayleigh'* has shown to depend directly ou

the absence of molecular rotation of the wave. In this paper Stokes

carried the approximation to a second order for finite depths, and to a

third order when the depth of fluid is infinite. In the reprint of his

papers''' (1880) he adds a supplement to the above in which a totally

different method is employed. Instead of taking the rectangular co-
ordinates of a particle as independent variables and expressing the

velocity potential thereby as usual, the velocity potential and stream

functions are taken as independents and the co-ordinates of a point

sought in terms of them. This so much simplifies the calculation that

it is an easy matter to press the approximation to the fifth oi'der for

infinitely deep fluids, and to the third order for those of finite depth. In

+infinitely deep fluids a wave-form of length 27r/wi and height 2a ^m^ a^

the velocity of propagation (c) is given by''

This embraces so far as the third order the results of the earlier paper.

To the third order this agrees with the expansion for a trochoid, and

therefore the curve approximates to Gerstuer's and Rankine's form men-

tioned below.' In the same paper Stokes also considers the analogous

problem for the waves at the common surface between two liquids. When

the fluids are confined by horizontal rigid walls there is as before only

one form of wave, for given velocity of propagation, and the velocity (c)

= -- +is given by 2x0- ^\ (p p^) \p tanh 2irhj\ p^ tanh 27r/i,'/A.}"'

where h, /t' are the thicknesses of the fluids, and the meanings of the

other constants are evident. The case is difiTerent when the upper fluid

has a free surface. Here either for given wave-length or for given

velocity of propagation there are two possible systems of wave-forms.

One of these, when the lower fluid is deep, corresponds to that form,

which is propagated on a single surface, and this whatever the depth of

the upper fluid. The other form is propagated with velocity given by
= +gX(p-27rc2
                 pi) (p tanh 2Trh^ jX p')"'.

Only one definite series of waves of permanent typo can be pro-

pagated in a fluid in which no vortex motion is present ; but it does not

follow that this is the only permanent form which is possible in a perfect

fluid. One other at least is known, which was first discovered by

Gerstner^ in 1802, and afterwards independently by Rankine'^ in 1862.

The latter gives a most elegant geometrical proof that a trochoidal form

of wave is a possible one, and that the velocity of propagation is

\/((7X/27r). Here the motion of any particle is a uniform one in a circle,

the radius of the circle diminishing with the depth. In a later note * he

discovers the essential difierence between this mode of wave-motion and

that considered by Stokes. It lies in the fact that the exact trochoidal

waves possess molecular rotation. Stokes notices this in the reprint of

his own papers^ and points out that in order that such waves may be

excited in a perfect fluid by operations on the surface alone a preparation

must be laid in the shape of a horizontal velocity decreasing from the

surface downwards according to the law exp (--4-!rh/\) where k is a

function of the depth given by

The physical interest therefore of these motions is not so great as has
been sometimes thought.

     The same objection, amongst others, lies against an attempt by Hagen''

to develop a solTiewliat similar theory for a fluid of finite depth. In tlie
trocboidal waves in deep fluids all the jDarticles describe circles with

uniform velocities. Hagen starts by assuming the path to be an ellipse
distorted so that the higher and lower halves are raised from the sym-
metrical position, i.e. the paths are given by

                  = = +a; a sin f, y ft cos f y cos^ f

where ^ is a function of the time and cij3,y are constants for each

particle. He also assumes that particles in a vertical line always remain

so. The condition of constant pressure at the surface as expressed by
him is only approximately satisfied. St. Venant' has given for stationary
waves a theory similar to that of Gerstner's for progressive waves, and
has also attempted to develop a theory for progressive and stationary
waves when the fluid is of a finite depth, but unfortunately his theory

does not satisfy the equation of continuity.

     The limiting form of trochoidal waves being the cuspidal, it is clear
that permanent waves could exist whose crests would be infinitely fine, a
result contradicted by experience if we suppose the theory actually to
apply to waves as ordinarily seen, that is in irrotational motion. This
alone would show that they cannot be taken as the type of naturally
produced waves. In another wave-form considered by Rankine,^

= -·4/ 2mj/X  (-e.vj}  2-7/ /A) cos 27rxl\

the steepest form cuts itself at 90° ; but this is a forced wave, that is the
pressure along the surface is not constant. The velocity of propagation
here also is \/((7\/27r). In a supplement to this paper^ he attempts to
prove that all waves in which molecular rotation is null must begin to

break when the two slopes of the crest meet at a right angle. But this
has been criticised by Stokes' who has very neatly proved that if such a
sharp angle is possible it must be one of 120° and this is borne out by

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the fact that the analytical series for the permanent type of irrotational
periodic waves seems to become divergent as the wave approaches the
form with a crest of 120°.

     The question of permanent types of waves of longitudinal disturbance
through the medium, properly belongs to the domain of the theory of
sound. It has been investigated by Stokes,* Earnshaw,*" Riemann,^ and
Rankine.^ The essential difference between this case and the preceding

=is that the medium must fulfil the condition (t^djjjdp const. Earnshaw

regarded this as unrealisable ; but Rankine has shown that with a given
law of conduction of heat, there are types of waves which can be pro-

fully treated by Lagrange, Airy, and others. If in addition to small ratio

of depth to length, the ratio of height of wave to depth is also small,

the'same paper he points out that in a canal of slowly varying section, if

the velocity of the stream be less than that of a free wave, a contraction

of the channel produces a decrease in wave-height, and vice versa. The

opposite happens if the velocity of the stream is greater than that of a

free wave.

seen how, in this case, the solution is unique for given velocity of

propagation. But this theory does not take account of the question

whether a solitary wave can be thus propagated ; in fact, it is clear that

the functions determining such a wave must not be expressible as a series
of circular functions, as the motion is essentially non-periodic. That

such waves exist has been known for a long period, since the experiments

of Scott-Russell brought to light the wave called by him the solitary

wave. In the last report, Stokes has mentioned Earnshaw's attempt at

giving a mathematical theory of this kind of wave, and has pointed out

the objection to it, that it requires a finite change of velocity and pressure

at the beginning and end of the wave. Rayleigh has noticed that the

cause of this is that Earnshaw's wave contains molecular rotation, whilst
Athe fluid beyond the wave is at rest.
                                          satisfactory theory^ has been

given by Boussinesq,^ when the curvature of the wave-profile is of such

a magnitude that d*i//cM may be neglected. He deduces that the

velocity of the wave is given by s/ gh where h is the primitive depth of
the fluid, which is Russell's result, as found by experiment. The form

=of the profile is given hy y a sech^ a!A/(3a/4 h^), a being the height

of the wave above the original surface. The centre of gravity of this

wave is at one-third of its height above the undisturbed level.

Boussinesq introduces a quantity, connected with any swelling of fluid

propagated along the surface, which he calls the moment of instability.

For all swellings of equal energy this moment! s least when the svrelling

is the solitary wave,  which  keeps  its  form                           when the moment is not

quite a minimum, the form of the swelling will oscillate about the

permanent form given above. It follows, from the analysis, that a

negative permanent wave is impossible, a result also of Russell s

experiments. The paths' described in solitary waves by particles of the

fluid are parabolic arcs with axes vertical, constant horizontal chord

equal to the quotient of the volume of the wave by the primitive depth,

and height proportional to the initial height of the pai-ticle above the

bottom ; being, for a particle at the surface, equal to the height of the
wave. The latus rectum at the surface is four-thirds the primitive depth

of the fluid, and varies for other particles inversely as their height above

the bottom, and is independent of the height of the wave. Rayleigh^

also gave, independently, a few years later, a theory of the solitary wave

agreeing with that of Boussinesq's.

     Rankine-^ has attempted to determine the velocity of propagation of
any possible kind of wave in a liquid of limited or unlimited depth

simply from the fact that the free surface is one of constant pressure.

But, in reality, he implicitly assumes that the waves are of a permanent

type. He proves that the velocity of propagation is equal to that

acquired by a body in falling through half the virtual depth. In this, the

velocity of the wave is defined as the mean of the velocities with which

the form advances relatively to particles in the crest and trough

respectively, and the virtual depth as follows : Suppose a stream flowing

of horizontal disturbance should equal the whole amount of horizontal

disturbance in the actual fluid between two vertical planes, through the

Wecrest and trough respectively, is the virtual depth.                                                                               have seen how

an analogous theorem can be deduced from the theory of dynamical

similarity.

In all the foregoing, the waves have been regarded as following each

other in infinite series, or the whole extent of the fluid has been taken

into consideration. The theory would have to be modified, therefore,
when waves ai'e propagated into fluid at rest. This happens, for instance,

M'ith the trail of waves from the bow of a boat, or the group of waves

formed on the surface of water by pei-iodically disturbing it for a

short interval. It is then observed that the waves are not of the same

size, but that they advance in a group, of which the largest are in the

middle, and that the group itself progresses with only half the velocity

of the waves themselves. If a single wave be observed, it is seen to die

gradually out, while others are formed in its rear. The explanation of
this was given by Osborne Reynolds, at the meeting of this Association

at Plymouth, in 1877.'' The energy of a liquid trochoidal wave is half

kinetic and half potential, the latter of which is transmitted at the rate
of its amount in unit of length X the velocity of the wave. It is then easy

to see that, in a group of waves, which slightly decrease in size towards

the front, the form of wave is transmitted twice as fast as the energy,
and the velocity of the group is only one-half that of the waves composing
it. The propagation of groups of waves had been considered before

Vand showed that if is the velocity of propagation of a wave-form of

length ^TTJli, the velocity of the group is d (kY)ldk. In the 'Proceedings

of the Mathematical Society,'^ Rayleigh extends Reynolds's theory to other

types of waves, and attempts to show how his expressions for the velocity

may result from the theory of the latter. If the velocity of the wave

vary as the ?Ath power of its wave-length, the velocity of group-propa-

--gation is (1 n) times the velocity of the wave (V) ; thus, for deep-water

V^Vwaves it is                       (beats travel with the same velocity
; for aerial waves,

as the notes) ; and for waves due to capillary action on the surface

it is fV.
     The theory of these latter waves has been given by Thomson. ^ The

velocity of propagation Avith air of density a, above water whose super-

= - ++ficial tension is T is v/(<7,\/2t 27rT,//\) where pi g(l ff)/! o-)
= +and T, T/(l a). So long as the wave-length is less than 27r V(TJgi)

the velocity of propagation increases as the wave-length diminishes, and

the capillary tension has most effect in producing the motion, while if the

wave-length is greater, the velocity of propagation increases with the

wave-length, and gravity has most effect. Thomson proposes to confine

the name ripples to fluid waves whose wave-length is less than this

critical value. The velocity of propagation is then a minimum and

^/(2^/ C^TiTi) ). For water, this gives a velocity of 23 centimeters per

second for a wave-length of 17 centimeters. This result agrees well with

some experiments made by him on sea water. When wind acts on the

surface, the results are modified, the wave-velocity with a wind-velocity
V + ± --equal to
is equal to ffV/(l rr)               {w^ (7V2(1+ a) "^jJ where w is

the velocitj^, without wind. The discussion of this formula leads to

interesting results ; for instance, that the surface of still water is unstable

if the velocity of the wind exceeds

              ^^'^/^-^))

This accounts for the fact that a small breath of Avind sweeping over the
surface of still water dims the surface only while it lasts, for the capillary
waves die away at once through the viscosity of the water. The values of
the velocity of propagation of capillary waves on water without air, have
been found by Kohicek,^ apparently without knowledge of Thomson's

work.

    Some very elegant illustrations of Huyghen's principle as applied to
liquid waves have been given by Hirst.* He has developed the differen-

tial equations for the line of ripple due to any centres, or lines of
disturbance, which give small waves, as, for instance, the ripples just
mentioned, on the surface of fluid moving in any manner ; and has
applied them particularly to the case where the centre of disturbance
describes a circle uniformly on still water. The results are compared
with experiment, with full agreement between theory and practice.

Report of the Cotnriilttee, consisting of Sir William Thomson,
   Professor EoscoE, Dr. J. H. Gladstone, and Dr. Schuster

   (Secretary), appointed for the piirpose of collecting information

   tvith regard to Meteoric Dust, and to consider the question of

   undertaking regular observations in various localities.

This Committee was appointed for the double purpose of examining the

observations hitherto recorded on the subject of meteoric dust, and of
discussing the possibility of future more systematic investigations.

     With regard to the first point, we note that in a paper presented to
the Royal Astronomical Society ^ in 1879, Mr. Ranyard has given what
appears to be a j^retty complete account of the known observations as to

the presence of meteoric dust in the atmosphere.

     It appears that in the year 1852 Professor Andrews found native iron
in the basalt of the Giant's Causeway. Nordenskjold found particles of
iron, which in all probability had a cosmic origin, in the snows of Fin-
land and the icefields of the Arctic regions. Dr. T. L. Phipson, and,
more recently, Tissandier, found similar particles deposited by the winds
on plates exposed in different localities. Finally, Mr. John Murray dis-
covered magnetic particles raised from the deposits at the bottom of the
sea by H.M.S. Challenger. These particles were examined by Professor
Alexander Herschel, who agreed with Mr. Murray in ascribing a cosmic
origin to these particles. For fuller details and all references we must
refer to Mr. Ranyard's paper.

     Some interesting papers have also been published by Professors

Silvestri and Tacchini.^

     There can be little doubt that magnetic dust, which in all probability
derives its origin from meteors, has often been observed, though it ought
to be mentioned that some writers have come to a contrary conclusion.^

The question arises in what way we can exercise our knowledge on these

points to an appreciable extent.

   A further series of occasional observations would in all probability

lead to no result of great value unless the observations were continued

over a considerable length of time, and carried on in places specially

adapted for the purpose.

For we know that meteoric dust does fall, and further observations

onght, if possible, to be directed rather towards an approximate estimate

of the quantity which falls within a given time. Difficulties very likely

will be found in the determination of the locality in which the observa-

tions should be conducted. The place ought to be sheltered as much as

possible against any ordinary dust not of meteoric origin. The lonely

spots best fitted for these observations ai-e generally accessible to occa-

sional experiments only, and do not lend themselves easily to a regular

series of observations. Nevertheless, experiments continued for a few

months at some elevated spot in the Alps might lead to valuable results.

The Committee would like to draw attention to an instrument which

might be well fitted for snch observations. It was devised by Dr.

Pierre Miquel for the purpose of examining, not the meteoric particles,

Abut organic and organised matters floating about in the air.  descrip-

tion, with illustrations, will be found in the ' Annuaire de Montsouris ' for

1879.

Two forms of the instrument are given. In the first form, which is

only adapted to permanent places of observation, an aspirator draws a

quantity of air which can be measured through a fine hole. The air

impinges on a plate coated with glycerine, which retains all solid matter.

By means of this instrument we may determine the quantity of solid

particles within a given volume of air.
     The second more portable form does not allow such an accurate

quantitative analysis. The instrument is attached to a weathercock, and

thus is always directed against the wind, which traverses it, and

deposits, as in the other permanent form, its solid matter on a glycerine

plate. An anemometer placed in the vicinity serves to give an approxi-

mate idea of the quantity of air which has passed through the apparatus.

These instruments have been called aeroscopes by their inventor.
     But perhaps the simpler plan of exposing a large horizontal surface

covered with glycerine, and examining the dust deposited on it, will

prove the most efficient for the purpose which the Committee has in

view.

The Committee placed upon the table the volume of calculations relative

to the equator, as a specimen of the five volumes which will ultimately
be placed, for reference, in the library of Trinity College, Dublin ; and
explained the method by which the reductions had been made.

     The formulae, by means of which the calculations were made, have

been published in the British Association Report for the Sheffield meeting

(1879), and the Royal Irish Academy have undertaken the publication of

all the summarised results in detail, so that it will not be necessary to ask
the Association to undergo the expense of printing them.

Fourteenth Report of the Committee, consistinrf o/ Professor Everett,

   Professor ED\^'ARD Hull, Dr. Clement Le Neve Foster, Professor

   Mr. GrALLOWAY, jNIr. JoSERii DiCKiNSON, Mr. Gr. F. Deacon, Mr.

   of investigating the Rate of Increase of Underground Tempera-
   ture doivmuarcls in various Localities of Dry Land and under
    Water, Dratun ^^_p by Professor Everett (Secretary).

Six observations in the Talargoch Lead Mine, Flintshire, were given in
last Report, and another has since been taken at a point distant 400
yards to the S.S.W. from Station VI. there mentioned. The depth
beneath the surface of the ground is 220 yards, and the position is in a
level going west from the engine-shaft. It was 3 yards from the fore-
breast, and had only been exposed nine days. The level was dry and

there was not much circulation of air. The thermometer (one of the

Committee's slow-action instruments) was inserted in a hole 25 inches
deep, which was plugged with rag and 12 inches of clay after its inser-
tion. It was withdrawn and read on three several occasions, July 19, 23,
and 27, and on each occasion the temperature found was 62° Fahr.

    Assuming, as in last year's Report, that 48° is the mean temperature
at the surface, this would give an increase of 14° in 660 feet, or of 1° for
47 feet. The rock is white limestone with a little chert.

     Comparing this observation with the other six, which exhibited great
discordances among themselves, the discordance is still fuT'ther increased,
ON THE RATE OF INCREASE OF UNDERGROUND TEMPER ATURE. 91

this last station being relatively hotter than any of the others. Though

only 24 feet deeper than Station VI., it is 3-2° warmer ; and Station VI.
was itself exceptionally warm.

      It is evident that there are local sources of distui-bance which render

 this spot unsuitable for obtaining average results. The observation itself

may be relied upon as correct, having been made by the captain of the
mine, Mr. J. Lean, who assisted Mr. Strahan in last year's observations.

      Mr. E. Garside, engineering student. Queen's College, Belfast, has
continued his observations in the East Manchester coal-field.

     In Ashton Moss Colliery, the temperature was observed on June 27 at
the depth of 930 yards, and found to be 85-3°, the thermometer being

inserted in a hole 2 inches in diameter and 3^ feet deep, drilled for the
purpose in hard blue shale which lies below the Great Mine coal seam,
being newly-opened ground, dry, and free from cracks. The hole was
allowed to stand ten or fifteen minutes, that the heat of drilling might
partially escape, and one of the Committee's slow-action thermometers
was then inserted with proper plugging, and left in for six hours. It
was not considered advisable to leave it longer, as, ' owing to the great
crush and unsettled state of the ground,' there might have been difficulty

in extracting it. Up to the time at which the thermometer was withdrawn,

no disturbance of the solidity of the ground had occurred. The tunnel,
and especially this part of it, was free from the action of any strong air-

current.

    Assuming 49° as the surface-temperature, we have here an increase of

36-3° in 2,790 feet, which is at the rate of 1° in 76-9 feet.

Earlier observations were taken, at the depths of 871 and 897 yards,

by the colliery engineer ; but Mr. Garside reports that the thermometer

with which they were taken was an ordinary cheap one with wood scale,

and that on examination the tube was found to be a little loose in the

scale. It seems best therefore to neglect them as unreliable.

 In reference to  an  apprehension  which was                                                                                                                                                                         expressed that the heat of

^

drilling had not had sufficient time to escape, Mr. Garside writes that he

has on several occasions made a second observation in the same hole in

places where he knew that the strata would stand and not crack, and he

has always found the temperature unchanged                                                                                                                                                                            but that it is impossible to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

repeat the observation at such great depths as that of Ashton Moss, as in

a few hours the holes became crooked.

Mr. Garside's next observation was at Bredbnry Colliery (in the

Acounty of Cheshire), at the depth of 340 yards.                                                                                                                                                                      hole was drilled, as

before, in dry warren earth (an argillaceous rock) free from cracks or

water, in New Mine south level ; and the temperature, observed as before,

was 62°.

     Assuming (as above) 49° as the surface-temperature, we have here an

increase of 13° in 1,020 feet, which is at the rate of 1° in 78-5 feet.
     The distance from Ashton Moss Colliery is three or four miles, and

the two shafts are sunk through the same coal-measures, one being near

the outcrop, and the other more on the deep.
     Making no assumption as to surface-temperature, but comparing the

two observations with each other, we have an increase of 23-3° in 1,770
feet, which is at the rate of 1° in 760 feet. The consistency of these

results is eminently satisfactory.

    On a subsequent date, July 19, Mr. Garside took the temperature at
Nook Pit, belonging to the Broad Oak Colliery Company, at the depth of
--92 iiEPORT 1881.

350 yards, in the floor of the Royley Mine. It is in newly opened gronnd,

free from cracks or other visible irregularities, at the far end of the newly

opened North Level. The depth of the hole, which was in hard warren

earth, and the other conditions of observation, were the same as before,

and the temperature observed was 62^° Fahr.

Taking the surface-temperature as 49°, this gives an increase of 13g-°

in 1,050 feet, or of 1° for 79 feet.

    AH these stations, as well as Dukinfield, where Mr. Garside last year

obtained results in good agreement with those now presented, are within

a few miles of each other and close to the river Tame, which is here the

boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire. Mr. Garside calls attention

to the great quantity of water which is found in some parts of the rock

overlying the coal-measures in this district, a source Avhich is largely

di'awn upon for water-supply, and suggests, with much show of reason,

that its presence may account for the slowness of the rate of increase

shown by all these observations.

Mr. James M'Murtrie, general manager of the Radstock Collieries, near

Bath, has taken observations in three different pits belonging to these

collieries. The instrument used in each case was one of the Committee's

slow-acting thermometers, placed in a hole drilled 2 feet deep, which was

Ajilugged with about 4 inches of clay.  moderate current of air was

passing. The level, in each case, was dry and free from cracks, and the

face at the place where the hole was drilled had only been exposed a day

or two. The rocks overhead consist of lias above, then new red sand-

stone, and under this the shales and sandstones of the coal-measures. The

mines, speaking generally, are comparatively dry, and the strata were

perfectly dry where the temperatures were taken. There are no great hills

near, the Mendips being about six miles distant, and the surface rises

about one in fifty towards them, leaving out of account local undulations.

The strata in all three cases were nearly level.

In Wells May Pit, the thermometer was left two days in a hole drilled

in the sandstone rock at the depth of 560 feet, and read 61'7°.

In Ludlow's Pit, it was left two days in a hole drilled in the Ball Vein

coal, at the depth of 1,000 feet, and read 63°.

In the same pit it was left five days in a hole drilled in the Middle

Vein coal, at the depth of 810 feet, and read 63°.

All these observations were taken in June and July of the present

year. Arranging them in order of depth, and assuming the surface-

temperature to be 50°, the result stands thus :

                      I. Accotmt of the experiments.

We feel some difficulty as to the form wliich this report should talce,

because we are still carrying on our experiments, and have, as yet,
arrived at no final results. As, however, we have done a good deal of
"woi'k, and have come to conclusions of some interest, we think it better

to give at once an account of our operations up to the present time,

rather than to defer it to the fnture.

    In November, 1878, Sir William Thomson saggested to me that

I should endeavour to investigate experimentally the lunar disturbance

of gravity, and the question of the tidal yielding of the solid earth.

In May, 1879, we both visited him at Glasgow, and there saw an

instrument, which, although roughly put togethea", he believed to contain

the principle by which success might perhaps be attained. The instrument

was erected in the Physical Laboratory of the University of Glasgow.

We are not in a position to give an accurate description of it, but the

following rough details are quite sufficient.

   A solid lead cylinder, weighing perhaps a pound or two, was suspended

by a fine brass wire, about 5 feet in length, from the centre of the lintel

or cross-beam of the solid stone gallows, wliich is erected there for the

Apurpose of pendulum experiments.  spike projected a little way out

of the bottom of the cylindrical weight ; a single silk fibre, several
inches in length, was cemented to this spike, and the other end of the

fibre was cemented to the edge of an ordinary galvanometer-mii-ror.

A second silk fibre, of equal length, was cemented to the edge of the

mirror at a point near to the attachment of the former fibre. The other
end of this second fibre was then attached to a support, which was
connected with the base of the stone gallows. The support was so

placed that it stood very near to the spike at the bottom of the pendulum,
and the mirror thus hung by the bifilar suspension of two silks, which

stood exceedingly near to one another in their upper parts. The instru-
ment was sci'eened from draughts by paper pasted across between the two

pillars of the gallows ; but at the iDottom, on one side, a pane of glass
was inserted, thi-ough which one could see the pendulum-bob and

galvanometer-mirror.

It is obvious that a small displacement of the pendulum, in a direction

perpendicular to the two silks, will cause the mirror to turn about a

vertical axis.
94 HEPOBT-- 1881.

    A lamp and slit were arranged, as in a galvanometer, for exhibiting

the movement of the pendulum, by means of the beam of light reflected

from the mirror.

    No systematic observations were made, but we looked at the instrument
at various hours of the day and night, and on Sunday also, when the

street and railway traffic is very small.
     The reflected beam of light was found to be in incessant movement,

of so irregular a character that it was hardly possible to localise the
mean position of the spot of light on the screen, within 5 or 6 inches.

On returning to the instrument after several hours, we frequently found
that the light had wandered to quite a difi'erent part of the room, and wc

had sometimes to search through nearly a semicircle before finding it

again.

     Sir William Thomson showed us that, by standing some 10 feet away
from the piers, and swaying from one foot to the other, in time Avith the

free oscillations of the pendulum, quite a large oscillation of the spot of

light could be produced. Subsequent experience has taught us that con-
siderable precautions are necessary to avoid efl'ects of this kind, and the
stone piers at Glasgow did not seem to be well isolated from the floor, and

the top of the gallows was used as a junction for a number of electric

connections.

     The cause of the extreme irregularity of the movements of the pendulum
was obscure ; and as Sir William Thomson was of opinion that the instru-
ment was well worthy of careful study, we determined to undertake a

Woseries of experiments at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.

take this opportunity of recording our thanks to Lord Rayleigh' for his
kindness in placing rooms at our disposal, and for his constant readiness

to help us.

     The pressure of other employments on both of us prevented our
beginning operations immediately, and the length of time which we have
now spent over these experiments is partly referable to this cause,
although it is principally due to the number of difficulties to be overcome,
and to the quantity of apparatus which has had to be manufactured.

      In order to avoid the possibility of disturbance from terrestrial

magnetism, we determined that our pendulum should be made of pure
copper.'^ Mr. Hussey Vivian kindly gave me an introduction to Messrs.
Elkington, of Birmingham ; and, although it was quite out of their
ordinary line of business, they consented to make what we required.
Accordingly, they made a pair of electrolytically- deposited solid copper
cylinders, 5j inches long, and 2j inches in diameter. From their
appearance, we presume that the deposition was made on to the inside of
copper tubes, and we understand that it occupied six weeks to take place.

In November, 1879, they sent us these two heavy masses of copper, and,
declining any payment, courteously begged our acceptance of them.

Of these two cylinders we have, as yet, only used one but should our
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

pi-esent endeavours lead to results of interest, we shall ultimately require

both of them.

     Two months before the receipt of our weights, the British Association

had reappointed the Committee for the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity,
and had added our names thereto. Since that time, with the exception

     ' Professor Maxwell had given us permission to use the ' pendulum room,' but we
had not yet begun our operations at the time of his death.

    We" now think that this was probably a superfluity of precaution.
ON THE MEASDREMENT OV THE LUNAU DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 95

of compulsory intermissions, we have continued to work at this subject.

My brother Horace and I have always discussed together the plan on

which to pi'oceed ; but up to the present time much the larger part of

the work has consisted in devising mechanical expedients for overcoming

difficulties. In this work he has borne by very far the larger share ; and
the apparatus has been throughout constructed from his designs, and

under his superintendence, by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument

Company.

Near the corner of a stone-paved ground-floor room in the Cavendish

Laboratory there stands a very solid stone gallows, similar to, but rather

more massive than, the one at Glasgow. As it did not appear thoroughly

free from rigid connection with the floor, we had the pavement raised all

round the piers, and the earth was excavated from round the brick

basement to the depth of about 2 feet 6 inches, until we were assured

that there was no connection with the floor or walls of the room, excepting

through the earth. The ditch, which was left round the piers, was

found very useful for enabling us to carry out the somewhat delicate

manipulations involved in hanging the mirror by its two silk fibres.

Into the middle of the flat ends of one of our copper weights (which

weighed 4,797 grammes, with spec. gr. 8-91) were screwed a pair of

copper  plugs                             one plug was  square-headed and             the other  pointed.  Into
                                       ;

the centre of the square plug was soldered a thin copper wire, just capable

of sustaining the weight, and intended to hang the pendulum.

   A stout cast-iron tripod was made for the support of the pendulum.

Through a hole in the centre of it there ran rather loosely a stout iron rod

Awith a screw cut on it.                  nut ran on the screw and prevented the rod

from slipping through the hole. The other end of the copper wire was

fixed into the end of the rod.

The tripod was placed with its three legs resting near the margin of

the circular hole in the centre of the lintel of the gallows. The iron rod
was in the centre of the hole, and its lower end appeared about six inches

below the lower face of the lintel. The pendulum hung from the rod by

a wire of such length as to bring the spiked plug within a few inches of

the base of the gallows. This would of course be a very bad way of
hanging a pendulum which is intended to swing, but in our case the dis-

placements of the end of the pendulum were only likely to be of a magni-

tude to be estimated in thousandths or even millionths of an inch, and it

is certain that for such small displacements the nut from which the
pendulum hung could not possibly rock on its bearings. However, in

subsequent experiments we improved the arrangement by giving the nut

a flange, from which there projected three small equidistant knobs, on
which the nut rested.

The length of the pendulum from the upper juncture with the iron rod

down to the tip of the spike in the bob was 148-2 cm.

An iron box was cast with three short legs, two in front and one

behind                                    its interior dimensions were  15  x  15  x  17i cm. ;  it had a tap at
                                       ;

the back; the front face (15 X 17h) was left open, with ai-rangements for

fixing a plate-glass face thereon. "The top face (15 x 17i) was pierced

by a large round hole. On to this hole was cemented an ordinary

earthenware 4-inch drain pipe, and on to the top of this first pipe there
was cemented a second. The box was thus provided with a chimney
144 cm. high. The cubic contents of the box and chimney were about

3^ gallons.
96 REPORT-- 1881,

The box was' placed standing on tbe base of tlie gallows, witb the

chimney vertically underneath the round hole in the lintel. The top of

the chimney nearly reached the lower face of the lintel, and the iron rod

of the pendulum extended a few inches down into ihe chimney. The

pendulum wire ran down the middle of the chimney, and the lower half

of the pendulum bob was visible through the open face of the iron box.

The stone gallows faces towards the S.E., but we placed the box askew

on the base, so that its open face was directed towards the S.

The three legs of the box rested on little metal discs, each with a conical

hole in it, and these discs rested on three others of a somewhat larger size.

When the box was set ajo^^roximately in position, we could by an arrange-

ment of screws cause the smaller discs to slide a fraction of an inch on the

larger ones, and thus exactly adjust the position of the box and chimney.

   A small stand, something like a retort stand, about 4 inches high,

stood on a leaden base, with a short horizontal arm clamped by a screw on

to the thin vertical rod. This was the ' fixed ' support for the bifilar

suspension of the mirror. The stand was placed to the E. of the pendulum

bob, and the horizontal arm reached out until it came very close to the

sjDike of the iiendulum.

     The suspension and protection from tarnishing of our mirror gave us
much trouble, but it is useless to explain the various earlier methods

employed, because we have now overcome these difficulties in a manner to

be described later. The two cocoon fibres were fixed at a considerable

distance apart on the edge of the mirror, and as they were very short they

splayed out at nearly a right angle to one another. By means of this

arrangement the free period of oscillation of the mirror was made very

short, and we were easily able to separate the long free swing of the pen-

dulum from the short oscillations of the mirror.

The mirror was hung so that the upper ends of the silks stood wiiliin

an eighth of an inch of one another, but the tip of the spike stood ^ or -j'|j of
an inch higher than the fixed support. The plate-glass front of the box

was then fixed on with indiarubber packing.

It is obvious that a movement of the box pai'allel to the front from E.

to W. would bring the two fibres nearer together ; this operation we shall

Adescribe as sensitising the instrument.       movement of the box perpen-

dicular to the front would cause the mirror to show its face parallel to tlie

front of the box ; this operation we shall describe as centralising. As

sensitising will generally decentralise, both sets of screws had to be

worked alternately.

     The adjusting screws for moving the box did not work very well
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nevertheless, by a little trouble we managed to bring the two silks of the

bifilar suspension very close to one another.

After the instrument had been hung as above described, wo t)-ied a

preliminary sensitisation, and found the pendulum to respond to a slight

touch on either pier. The spot of light reflected from tlie mirror was very

unsteady, but not nearly so much so as in the Glasgow experiment; and

we were quite unable to produce any perceptible increase of agitation by

stamping or swaying to and fro on the stone floor. This showed that the

isolation of the pier was far more sati.sfactory than at Glasgow.

We Wethen filled the box and pipes with water.    had much trouble

with slow leakage of the vessel, but the most serious difficulty arose from

the air-bubbles which adhered to the pendulum. By using boiled water

we obviated this fairly well, but we concluded that it was a great mistake
ON TBB MEASUEEMBNI OF THE LUNAE DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 97

to have a flat bottom to the pendnlum. This mistake we have remedied

in the final experiment described in the present paper.

     The damping effect of the water on the oscillations of the pendulum

and of the mirror was very great, and although the incessant dance of

the light contmued, it was of much smaller amplitude, and comparatively

large oscillations of the pendulum, caused by giving the piers a push,

Adied out after two or three swings.                                                        very slight push on the stone piers

displaced the mean position of the light, but jumping and stamping on

the pavement of the room produced no perceptible effect. If, however,

one of us stood on the bare earth in the ditch behind, or before the

massive stone pier, a very sensible deflection of the light was caused

this we now know was caused by an elastic depression of the earth, which

Atilted the whole structure in one or the other direction.                                  pull of a few

ounces, delivered horizontally on the centre of the lintel, produced a clear

deflection, and when the pull was 81bs., the deflection of the spot of hght

amounted to 45 cm. Wc then determined to make some rough systematic

experiments.

     The room Avas darkened by shutters over all the windows, and the
doors were kept closed. The paraffin lamp stood at three or four feet to
the S.E. of the easterly stone pier, but the light was screened from the

pier.

   We began our readings at 12 noon (March 15, 1880), and took eight

between that time and 10.30 p.m. From 12 noon nntil 4 p.m. the lamp

was left burning, but afterwards it was only lighted for about a minute to

take each reading. At 12 the reailing was 595 m.m., and at 4 p.m. it

was 936 m.m.'                                                                            these readings, together with the intermediate ones,
                                                                                      ;

showed that the pendulum had been moving northwards with a nearly

uniform velocity. After the lamp was put out, the pendulum moved

southward, and by 10.30 p.m. was nearly in the same position as at noon.

    During the whole of the two following days and a part of the next we

took a number of readings from 9 A.M. nntil 11 p.m. The observations

when gi-aphically exhibited showed a fairly regular wave, the pendulum

being at the maximum of its northern excursion between 5 and 7 p.m.,

and probably furthest south between the . same hours in the morning.

But besides this wave motion, the mean position for the day travelled a

Wegood deal northward.                                                                   think that a part of this diurnal oscillation

was due to the warping of the stone columns from changes of temperature.

An increase of temperature on the south-east faces of the piers canned

the lintel towards the north-west, and of this displacement we observed

only the northerly component. The lamp produced a very rapid efi'ect,

and the diurnal change lagged some two hours behind the change in the

external air. The difference between the temperatures of the S.E. and
N.W. faces of the pier must have been very slight indeed. At that time,

and indeed until quite recently, we attributed the whole of this diurnal

oscillation to the warping of the piers, but we now feel nearly certain that

it was due in great measure to a real change in the horizon.

   We found that warming one of the legs of the iron tripod, even by

contact with the finger, produced a marked effect, and we concluded that

the mode of suspension was unsatisfactory.

     ' I give the numbers as recorded in the note-book, but the readings would some-

times diifer by 2 or 3 m.m. within half-a-minute. The light always waves toand
fro in an uncertain sort of way, so that it is impossible to assign a mean position

witli any certainty.

1881.                                                                                    H

    Altliotlgli we had thus learnt that changes of temperature formed
the great obstacle in the way of success, thei'c were a good many things

to be learnt from the instrument as it existed at that time.
     After the box and pipes had been filled for some days the plate-glass

front cracked quite across, and a slow leakage began to take place ; we
were thus compelled to dismount tlic whole appai-atus and to make a

fresh start.

     It is obvious that to detect and measure displacements of the pendulum

in the N. and S. direction, the azimuth of the silks by which the mirror

is suspended must be E. and W., and that although any E. and W. dis-

placement of the pendulum will be invisible, still such displacement will

alter the sensitiveness of the instrument for the N. and S. disiDlacements.

In order to obviate this we determined to constrain the pendulum to

move only iu the N. and S. azimuth.
    Accordingly wc had a T-piece about 4 inches long fixed to the end of

the iron rod from which the pendulum hung. The two ends of a fine

copper wire were soldered into the ends of the T-picce ; a long loop of
wire was thus formed. The square-headed plug at the top of the

pendulum-bob was replaced by another containing a small copper wheel,

which could revolve about a horizontal axis. The bearings of the wheel

were open on one side.

    When the wheel was placed to ride on the bottom of the wire loop,

and the pendulum-bob hooked on to the axle of the wheel by the open
bearings, we had our pendulum hanging by a bifilar suspension. The

motion of the pendulum was thus constrained to take place onlj'^ perpen-

dicular to the plane of the wire loop.

     The iron tripod was replaced by a slate slab large enough to entirely

cover the hole in the lintel of the gallows. Through the centre of the

slab was a round hole, of about one inch in diameter, through which

passed the ii'on rod with the T-jjiece at the lower end. The iron rod was

supported on the slate by means of the flanged nut above referred to.

There was also a straight slot, cut quite through the slab, running from

the central hole to the margin. The purpose of this slot will be explained

presently.

    In the preceding experiment we had no means of determining the

absolute amount of displacement of the pendulum, although, of course,

we knew that it must be very small. There are two methods by which

the  absolute  displacements  are determinable                                                                             one is to  cause  known  small
                                                                                                                        ;

displacements to the pendulum and to watch the effect on the mirror

and the second is to cause known small horizontal forces to act on the

Wependulum.    have hitherto only employed the latter method, but we

are rather inclined to think that the former may give better results.

    The following- plan for producing small known horizontal forces was

suggested by my Ijrother.

     Suppose there be a very large and a very small pendulum hanging by

wires of equal length from neighbouring points in the same horizon ; and
suppose the large and the small pendulum to be joined by a fibre which

is a very little shorter than the distance between the points of suspension.

Then each pendulum is obviously deflected a little from the vertical, but
the deflection of the small pendulum varies as the mass of the larger, and

mthat of the larger as the mass of the smaller. If be the mass of the

small pendulum, and If of the large one, and if a be the distance between

the points of suspension, then it may be easily shown that if a be in-
ON THE MEASDREMENT OV THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE 01? GRAVITY. 99

creased by a small leugfcli ca, the increase of tlie linear deflection of the

large pendulum is mcal(m + M). If I be the length of cither pendulum,
+the angular deflection of the larger one is mlajl^m M), and this is

the deflection which would be produced by a horizontal force equal to

Mmlajl{m+M) of gravity. It is clear, then, that by making the inequality

between the two weights rii and very great, and the displacement of the

point of suspension very small, we may deflect the large pendulum by as
small a quantity as we like. The theory is almost the same if the two

pendulums are not of exactly the same length, or if tho length of one of

them be varied.

    Now in our application of this principle we did not actually attach the

two pendulums together, but we made the little pendulum lean up against

the large one ; the theory is obviously just tho same.

We call the small pendulum ' the disturber,' because its use is to

Adisturb the large pendulum by known forces.  small copper weight for

the disturber weighed '732 grammes, and the large pendulum-bob, with its

pulley, weighed 4831"5. Therefore the one was 6600 times as massive as

the other. The disturber was hung by a platinum wire about xoVcr*'^ of
an inch in diameter, which is a good deal thinner than a fine human

hair.

   We must now explain how the disturber was suspended, and the

method of moving its point of suspension.

Parallel to the sides of the slot in the slate slab there was riveted a

pair of brass rails, one being V-shaped and the other flat ; on these rails

there slid a little carriage with three legs, one of which slid on one rail,

Aand the other two on the other.  brass rod with an eyelet-hole at the

end was fixed to the centre of the carriage, and was directed downwards

so that it passed through the centre of the slot. The slot was directed

so that it was perpendicular to the T-piece from which the pendulum hung,

and the brass rod of the little carriage was bent and of such length, that
when the carriage was pushed on its rails until it was as near the centre of

the slab as it would go, the eyelet-hole stood just below the T-piece, and

Ahalf-way between the two wires.  micrometer screw was clamped to

the slab and was arranged for making the carriage traverse known lengths

on its rails, and as the wires of the pendulum were in the E. and W.

plane, the carriage was caused to travel N. and S. by its micrometer

screw.

One end of the fine platinum wire was fastened to the eyelet, and the

other (as above stated) to the small disturbing weight. The platinum

wire was of such length that the disturber just reached the pulley by

Wewhich the big pendulum hung.    found that by pushing the carriage

up to the centre, and very slightly tilting it off one rail, we could cause

the disturber-weight to rest on either side of the pulley at will. If it

was left on the side of the pulley remote from the disturber-carriage, it

was in gear, and the traversing of the carriage on its rails would produce

a small pressure of the disturber on to the side of the pulley. If it was

left on the same side of the pulley as tho disturber-carriage, the two

pendulums were quite independent and the disturber was out of gear.

    On making allowance for the diS'erence in length between the pen-

dulum and the disturber, and for the manner in which the thrust was

delivered at the top of the pendulum, but omitting the corrections for
the weights of the suspending wires and for the elasticity of the copper

wire, we found that one turn of the micrometer screw should displace the
                                              H2
100 itEPORi-- 188i.

spike at the bottom of the pendulum tlirougli O'OOOl mln. or o^sVwTr^h of
an inch. The same displacement would be produced by an alteration in

the direction of gravity with reference to the earth's surface by jV^h of a

second of arc.

   A rough computation showed that the to and fro motion of the

pendulum in the N.S. azimuth, due to lunar attraction, should, if the

earth be rigid, be the same as that produced by 2f turns of the micro-
meter screw.

   We now return to the other arrangements made in re-erecting the

instrument.

   A new mirror, silver-ed on the face, was used, and was hung in a

slightly different manner.

The fluid in which the pendulum was himg was spirits and water.

The physical properties of such a mixture will be referred to later. In

order to avoid air-bubbles we boiled 3| gallons of spirits and water

for three hours in vacuo, and the result appeared satisfactory in that

respect.

After the mirror was hung, the plate-glass front to the box was fixed

and the vessel was filled by the tap in the back of the box. The disturber

was not introduced until afterwards, and we then found that the pen-

dulum I'esponded properly to the disturbance.

    As the heat of a lamp in the neighbourhood of the piers exercised a
large disturbance, we changed the method of observing, and read the

reflection of a scale with a telescope. The scale was a levelling staff

divided into feet, and tenths and hundredths of a foot, laid horizontally

at 15 feet fx-om the piers, with the telescope immediately over it.

Since the amount of fluid through which the light had to pass was

considerable, we wei'e forced to place a gas- flame immediately in front of

the scale ; but the gas was only kept alight long enough to take a

reading.

After sensitising the instrument we found that the incessant dance

of the image of the scale was markedly less than when the pendulum

Awas hung in water.         touch with a finger on either pier produced

deflection by bending the piers, and the instrument responded to the

disturber.

     The vessel had been filled with fluid for some days, and we had
just begun a series of readings, when the plate-glass front again cracked

quite across without any previous warning. Thus ended our second

attempt.

     In the third experiment (July and August, 1880) the arrangements

were so nearly the same as those just described that we need not refer to

them. The packing for the plate-glass front was fonned of red lead,

and this proved perfectly successful, whereas the indiarubber pack-

ing had twice failed. As we were troubled by invisible leakage and

by the evaporation of the fluid, we arranged an inverted bottle, so as

Wealways to keep the chimney full.  thought that when the T-piece at

the end of the shaft became exposed to the air, the pendulum became

much more unsteady, but we now think it at least possible that there

was merely a period of real terrestrial disturbance.

From August 10 to 14 we took a series of observations from early

Wemorning until late at night.  noted the same sort of diurnal oscilla-

tory motion as before, but the outline of the curve was far less regular.

This, we think, may perhaps be explained by the necessity we were under
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 101

of leaving the doors open a good deal, in order to permit the cord to pass
by which Lord Rayleifjh was spinning the British Association coil.

     Notwithstanding that the weather was sultry the warping of the
stone coliimus mast have been very slight, for a thermometer hung close

to the pier scarcely showed a degree of change between the day and
night, and the difference of temperature of the IST. and S. faces must have

been a very small fraction of a degree. At that time, however, we still

thought that the whole of the diurnal oscillation was due to the warping

of the columns.

   We next tried a series of experiments to test the sensitiveness of the

instrument.

As above remarked the image of the scale was continually in motion,

and moreover the mean reading was always shifting in either one direc-
tion or the other. At any one time it was possible to take a reading to
within -iVth of a foot with certainty, and to make an estimate of the
-p\^th of a foot, but the numbers given below are necessarily to be

regarded as very rough approximations.

    As above stated, the gallows faced about to the S.E., and we may
describe the two square piers as the E. and W. piers, and the edges

of each pier by the points of the compass towards which they are

directed.

    On August 14, 1880, my bi'other stood on a plank supported by the
pavement of the room close to the S.W. edge of the W. pier, and, light-

ing a spirit lamp, held the flame for ten seconds within an inch or two of

this edge of the pier. The effect was certainly produced of making the

pendulum-bob move northwards, but as such an effect is fused in the

diurnal change then sroing: on, the amount of effect was uncertain. He

then stood similarly near the N.E. edge of the E. pier, and held the

spirit flame actually licking the edge of the stone during one minute.

The effect should now be opposed to the diurnal change, and it was so.

Before the exposure to heat was over the reading had decreased '15 feet,

and after the heat was withdrawn the recovery began to take place

almost immediately. "VVe concluded afterwards that the effect was equi-

valent to a change of horizon of about 0"'15.

    When the flame was held near but not touching the lintel for thirty

seconds, the effect was obvious but scarcely measurable, even in round

numbers, on account of the unsteadiness of the image.

    When a heated lump of brass was pushed under the iron box no

effect whatever was perceived, and even when a spirit flame was held

so as to lick one side of the iron box during thirty seconds, M^e could not

ance, but these experiments seemed to show that convection currents in

the fluid produce remarkably little effect.

    When a pull of 300 grammes was delivered on to the centre of the

lintel in a southward direction, we determined by several trials that the
displacement of the reading was about '.SO feet, which may be equal to

about 0"'.3 change of horizon.

     Two-thirds of a watering-can of water was poured into the ditch at
the back of the pier. In this expei'iment the swelling of the ground

should have an effect antagonistic to that produced by the cooling of the

back face of the pier, and also to the diurnal changes then going on.

the same effect, and it took more than an honi* for the piers to regain their

former position. As the normal diurnal change was going on simulta-

neously, we do not know the length of time during which the water con-

tinued to produce an effect.

    On August 15 we tried a series of experiments with the disturber.
When the disturber was displaced on its rails, the penduluna took a very

perceptible time to take up its new position, on account of the A^scosity

of the fluid in which it was immersed.

The diurnal changes Avhich were going on pi'evented the readings

from being very accordant amongst themselves, but we concluded that

twenty-five turns of the screw gave between '4 foot and '3 foot alteration

in the reading on the scale. From tlie masses and dimensions of the

pendulum and disturber, we concluded that 1 foot of our scale corre-

sponded with about 1" change in horizon. Taking into account the

length of the pendulum, it appeared that 1 foot of our scale corresponded

with y-4:\jyth of a mm. displacement of the spike at the bottom of the

pendulum. Now as a tenth of a foot of alteration of reading could be

perceived with certainty, it followed that when the pendulum point
moved through T^^-fnT^li of ^ mm. we could certainly perceive it.

     During the first ten days the mean of the diurnal readings gradually

increased, showing that the pendulum was moving northwards, until the

reading had actually shifted 8 feet on the scale. It then became neces-

sary to shift the scale. Between August 23 and 25 the reading had

October we found that this change had continued. The mixTor had,

however, become tarnished, and it was no longer possible to take a

reading, although one could just see a gas flame by reflection from the

mirror.

    Whilst erecting the pendulum we had to stand on, and in front of,
the piers, and to put them under various kinds of stress, and we always

found that after such stress some sort of apparently abnormal changes in

the piers continued for three or four hours afterwards.

   We were at that time at a loss to understand the reason of this long-

continued change in the mean position of the pendulum, and were reluc-

tant to believe that it indicated any real change of horizon of the whole

soil ; but after having read the papers of MM. d'Abbadie and Planta-

mour, we now believe that such a real change was taking place.
    By this course of experiments it appeared that an instrument of the

kind desci'ibed may be brought to almost any degree of sensitiveness.

We had seen, however, that a stone support is unfavourable, because

the bad conductivity of stone prevents a rapid equalisation of tempera-

ture between different parts, and even small inequalities of temperature

produce considerable warping of the stone piers. But it now seems
probable that we exaggerated the amount of disturbance which may

arise from this cause.

   A cellar would undoubtedly be the best site for such an experiment,

but unfortunately there is no such place available in the Cavendish

Laboratory. Lord Rayleigh, however, placed the ' balance room ' at

our disposal, and this room has a northerly aspect. There are two

windows in it, high up on the north wall, and these we keep boarded up.
    The arrangements which we now intended to make were that the

pendulum and mirror should be hung in a very confined space, and

should be immersed in fluid of considerable viscosity. Tiie boundaiy of
ON THE MEASUBEMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 103

that space should be made of a heat-conducting material, which should
itself form the support for the pendulum. The whole instrument,

including the basement, was to be immersed in water, and the basement

itself was to be carefully detached from contact with the building in

which it stands. By these means we hoped to damp out the short oscil-

lations due to local tremors, but to allow the longer oscillations free to

take place ; but above all we desired that changes of temperature in the

instrument should take place with great slowness, and should be, as far

as possible, equal all round.

   We removed the pavement from the centre of the room, and had a

circular hole, about 3 feet 6 inches in diameter, excavated in the ' made
earth,' until we got down to the undistni-bed gravel, at a depth of about

2 feet 6 inches.

   We obtained a large cylindrical stone 2 feet 4 inches in diameter and

2 feet G inches in height, weighing about three-quarters of a ton. This

we had intended to place on the earth in the hole, so that its upper sur-

face should stand flush with the pavement of the room. But the excava-
tion had been carried down a little too deep, and therefore an ordinary

flat paving stone was placed on the earth, with a thin bedding of cement
underneath it. The cylindrical block was placed to stand upon the

paving stone, with a very thin bedding of lime and water between the

Wetwo stones. The svirface of the stone was then flush with the floor.

do not think that any sacrifice of stability has been made by this course.

An annular trench or ditch a little less than a foot across is left round

Wethe stone.  have lately had the bottom of the ditch cemented, and

the vertical sides lined with brickwork, which is kept clear of any con-

tact with the paA^ement of the room. On the S. side the ditch is a little

wider, and this permits us to stand in it conveniently. The bricked

ditch is watertight, and has a small overflow pipe into the drains. The

water in the ditch stands slightly higher than the flat top of the cylin-

drical stone, and thus the whole basement may be kept immersed in

water, and it is, presumably, at a very uniform temperature all round.

    Before describing the instrument itself we will explain the remaining

precautions for equalisation of temperature.

On the flat top of the stone stands a large barrel or tub, 5 feet G

inches high and 1 foot 10 inches in diameter, open at both ends. The

diameter of the stone is about 2 inches greater than the outside measure

of the diameter of the tub, and the tub thus nearly covers the whole of

the stone. The tub is well payed with pitch inside, and stands on two

felt rings soaked in tar. Five large iron weights, weighing altogether

nearly three-quarters of a ton, are hooked on to the upper edge of the

tub, in order to make the joint between the tub and the stone watertight.

Near  the  bottom  is  a  plate-glass  window                                         when  it  is in  position, the
                                                                                   ;

window faces to the S. Tliis tub is filled with water and the instru.ment

stands immersed therein.

   We had at first much trouble from the leakage of the tub, and we

have to thank Mr. Gordon, the assistant at the Laboratory, for his ready

help in overcoming this difficulty, as well as others which were per-

petually reciirring. The mounting of the tub was one of the last things
done before the instrument was ready for observation, and we must now

return to the description of the instrument itself.

   We used the same pendulum-bob as before, but we had its shape

altered so that the ends both above and below were conical surfaces,
--104 KEPOBX 1881.

whilst the central part was left cylindrical. The upper plug with its
pulley is replaced by another pliig bearing a short round horizontal rod,
with a rounded groove cut in it. The groove stands vertically over the
centre of the weight, and is designed for taking the wire of the bifilar
suspension of the pendulum ; when riding on the wire the pendulum-bob

hangs vertically.
     Part of this upper plug consists of a short thin horizontal arm about

an inch long. This arm is perpendicular to the plane of the groove, and
when the pendulum is in position, projects northwards. Through the
end of the arm is bored a fine vertical hole. This part of the apparatus
is for the modified form of disturber, which we are now using.

     The support for the pendulum consists of a stout copper tube 2^
inches in diameter inside measure, and it just admits the pendulum-bolj
with l^th inch play all round. The tube is 3 feet G inches in height, and
is closed at the lower end by a diaphragm, pierced in the centre by a
round hole, about ^ inch in diameter. The upper end has a ring of ,brass
soldered on to it, and this ring has a flange to it. The upper part of the

brass ring forms a short continuation 4' of an inch in length of the
copper tube. The ring is only inti'oduced as a means of fastening the

flange to the copper tube.

VThe upper edge of the brass continuation has three notches in it at

A120° apart on the circumference of the ring.  brass cap like the lid of

a pill-box has an inside measure ^ inch greater than the outside measure

of the brass ring. The brass cap has three rods which project inwards

from its circumference, and which are placed at 120° apart thereon.

When the cap is placed on the brass continuation of the upper tube, the

Vthree rods rest in the three notches, and the cap is geometrically fixed

Awith respect to the tube.  fine screw works through the centre of the

cap, and actuates an apparatus, not easy to explain without drawings, by
which the cap can be slightly tilted in one azimuth. The object of

tilting the cap is to enable us to sensitise the instrument by bringing the

silk fibres attached to the mirror into close proximity.

Into     the  cap are soldered the two  ends  of  a  fine  brass  wire the
                                                                                            ;

junctures are equidistant from the centre of the cap and on opposite sides

of it ; they lie on that diameter of the cap which is perpendicular to the
axis about which the tilting can be produced.

     "When the pendulum is hung on the brass wire loop by the groove in

the upper plug, the wires just clear the sides of the copper tube.

It is clear that the tilting of the cap is mechanically equivalent to a

shortening of one side of the wire loop and the lengthening of the other.

Hence the pendulum is susceptible of a small lateral adjustment by

means of the screw in the cap.

     To the bottom of the tube is soldered a second stout brass ring ; this

ring bears on it three stout brass legs inclined at 120° to one another,

all lying in a plane perpendicular to the copper tube. From the extre-

mity of each leg to the centre of the tube is 8^ inches. The last inch of

Veach leg is hollowed out on its under surface into the form of a radial

groove.

     There ai-e three detached short pieces of brass tube, each ending below
in a flange with three knobs on it, and at the upper end in a screw with a
rounded head. These three serve as feet for the instrument. These
three feet are placed on the upper surface of our basement stone at 120°
apart, estimated from the centre of the stone. The copper tube with its
     ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 105

Vlegs attached is set down so that the inverted grooves in the legs rest

on the rounded screw-head at the tops of the three feet, and each of the
feet rests on its three knobs on the stone. The bottom of the copper tube

is thus raised 5^ inches above the stone. By this arrangement the copper

tube is retained in position with reference to the stone, and it will be
observed that no part of the apparatus is under any constraint except
such as is just necessary to geometrically determine its position.

     The screws with rounded heads which form the three feet are
susceptible of small adjustments in height, and one of the three heads is
capable of more delicate adjustment, for it is actuated by a fine screw,
which is driven by a toothed wheel and pinion. The pinion is turned by
a wooden rod, made flexible by the insertion of a Hook's joint, and the
wooden rod reaches to the top of the tub, when it is mounted surrounding

the instrument.

     The adjustable leg is to the N. of the instrument, and as the

mirror faces S. we call it the 'back-leg.' When the copper support

is mounted on its three legs, a rough adjustment for the verticality of
the tube is made with two of the legs, and final adjustment is made by

the back-leg.

     It is obvious that if the back-leg be raised or depressed the point of

the pendulum is carried southwards or northwards, and the mirror turns
accordingly. Thus the back-leg with its screw and rod affords the
means of centralising the mirror. The arrangements for suspending the
mirror must now be described.

     The lower plug in the pendulum-bob is rounded and has a small

horizontal hole through it. When the pendulum is hung this rounded

plug just appears through the hole in the diaphragm at the bottom of

the copper tube.

   A small brass box, shaped like a disk, can be screwed on to the bottom

of the copper tube, in such a way that a diameter of the box forms a
straight line with the axis of the copper tube. One side of the box is of
plate glass, and when it is fastened in position the plate glass faces to

the S. This is the mirror-box; it is of such a size as to permit the

mirror to swing about 15° in either direction from parallelism with the

plate- glass front.

     The fixed support for the second fibre for the bifilar suspension of the
mirror may be described as a very small inverted retort-stand. The
vertical rod projects downwards from the underside of the diaphragm,
a little to the E. of the hole in the diaphragm ; and a small horizontal
arm projects from this rod, and is of such a length that its extremity
reaches to near the centre of the hole. This arm has a small eyelet-hole

pierced through a projection at its extremity.

     The mirror itself is a little larger than a shilling and is of thin plate
glass ; it has two holes drilled through the edge at about 60° from one
another. The mirror was silvered on both sides, and then dipped into
melted paraffin ; the paraffin and silver were then cleaned off one side.
The paraffin protects the silver from tarnishing, and the silver film seen
through the glass has been found to remain perfectly bright for months,

Aafter having been immersed in fluid during that time. piece of platinum

wire about xoVw^t of an inch in diameter is threaded twice through each
hole in opposite directions, in such a manner that with a continuous piece
of wire (formed by tying the two ends together) a pair of short loops are

formed at the edge of the mirror, over. each of the two holes. When the
106 REPOKT-- 1881.

mirror is hung from a silk fibre passing throngli botli loops, the weight of

the mirror is sufficient to pull each loop taut.

   A single silk fibre was threaded through the eyelet-hole at the end of

the blunt point of the pendulum-bob, and tied in such a way that there
was no loose end projecting so as to foul the other side of the bifilar
suspension. The other end of the silk fibi-e was knotted to a piece of
sewing silk on which a needle was threaded.

     The pendulum was then hung from the cap by its wire loop, outside
the copper tube, and the silk fibre with the sewing silk and needle
attached dangled down at the bottom. The cap, with the pendulum
attached thereto, was then hauled up and carefully let down into the
copper tube. The sewing silk, fibre, and blunt end came out through the

hole in the diaphragm.

      "We then sewed with the needle through the two loops on the margin
of the mirror, and then through the eyelet-hole in the little horizontal
arm. The silk was pulled taut, and the end fastened ofi" on to the little
vertical rod, from which the horizontal arm projects.

      The mirror then hangs with one part of the silk attached to the
 pendulum-bob and the other to the horizontal arm.

      The two parts of the silk are inclined to one another at a considerable

 angle, so that the free period of the mirror is short, but the upper parts
 of the silk stand very close to oiie another. The mirror-box encloses the
 mirror and makes the copper tube watertight.

      There is another pai't of the apparatus which has not yet been ex-
 plained, namely, the disturber. This part of the instrument was in reality
 arranged before the mirror was hung.

    We shall not give a full account of the disturber, because it does not

 seem to work very satisfactorily.
     In the form of disturber which we now use the variation of horizontal

 thrust is produced hj variation in the length of the disturbing pendulum,
 instead of by variation of the point of support as in the previous experi-

 ment. It was not easy to vary the point of support when the pendulum
 is hung in a tube which nearly fits it.

      The disturber-weight is a small lump of copper, and it hangs by fine
 sewing silk. The silk is threaded through the eyelet in the horizontal
 arm which forms part of the upper plug of the pendulum ; thus the
 disturber- weight is to the N. of the pendulum. The silk after passing
 between the wires suppoi-ting the pendulum has its other end attached to
 the cap at the top at a point to the S. of the centre of the cap. Thus
 the silk is slightly inclined to the plane through the wires. The arrange-
 ment for varying the length of the disturbing pendulum will not be
 explained in detail, but it may suffice to say that it is produced by a third

 weight, which we call the ' guide weight,' which may be hauled up or let
 down in an approximately vertical line. This guide weight determines by
 its position how much of the upper part of the silk of the disturber shall

  be cut off", so as not to form a part of the free cord by which the disturb-
  ing weight hangs.

      The guide weight may be raised or lowered by cords. which pass

 through the cap. If the apparatus were to work properly a given amount

  of displacement of the guide weight should produce a calculable horizontal
 thrust on the pendulum. The whole of the arrangements for the disturber

  could be made outside the copper tube, so that the pendulum was lowered

  into the tube with the disturber attached thereto.
ON THE MEAisURKMENT OF XHE LUNAll DISTUllBANCE Ok" GKAVITV. 107

     After tlie mirror was hung and the mirror-box screwed on, a brass cap

was fixed by screws on to the flange at the top of the copper tube. This
cap has a tube or chimney attached to it, the top of which rises five inches

above the top of the cap or lid from -which the pendulum hangs. From

this chimney emerges a rod attached to the screw by which the sensitising

apparatus is actuated, and also the silk by which the guide weight is

raised or depressed.

     The copper tube, with its appendages, was then filled with a boiled
mixture of filtered water and spirits of wine by means of a small tap in
the back of the mirror-box. The mixture was made by taking equal
volumes of the two fluids ; the boiling to which it was subjected will of
course have somewhat disturbed the proportions. Poiseuille has shown '
that a mixture of spirits and water has much greater viscosity than either

pure spirits or pure water. When the mixture is by weight in the pro-

portion of about seven of water to nine of spirits, the viscosity is nearly

three times as great as that of pure spirits or of pure water. As the

specific gravity of spirits is about -8, it follows that the mixture is to

be made by taking equal volumes of the two fluids. It is on account of
this remarkable foot that we chose this mixture in which to suspend
the pendulum, and we observed that the unsteadiness of the mirror was

markedly less than when the fluid used was simply water.
     The level of the fluid stood in our tubular support quite up to the top

of the chimney, and thus the highest point of the pendulum itself was

5 inches below the surface.

    The tub was then let down over the instrument, and the weights
hooked on to its edge. The plate-glass window in the tub stood on the
S. opposite to the mirror-box. The tub was filled with water up to
nearly the top of the chimney, and the ditch round the stone basement

was also ultimatelv filled with water. The whole instrument thus stood

immersed from top to bottom in water.

    Even before the tub was filled we thought that we noticed a diminu-
tion of unsteadiness in the image of a slit reflected from the mirror. The

filling of the tub exercised quite a striking effect in the increase of

steadiness, and the water in the ditch again operated favoui-ably.

   We met with much difiiculty at first in preventing serious leakage of

the tub, and as it is still not absolutely watertight, we have arranged a

Awater-pipe to drip about once a minute into the tub.  small overflow

pipe from the tub to the ditch allows a very slow dripping to go into the

Weditch, and thus both vessels are kept full to a constant level.  had

to take this course because we found that a rise of the water in the ditch
through half an inch produced a deflection of the pendulum. The ditch,

it must bo remembered, was a little broader on the S. side than else-

where.

    In Maj^, 1881, we took a series of observations with the light, slit and

scale. The scale was about 7 feet from the tub, and in order to read it
we found it convenient to kneel behind the scale on the ground. I was

one day watching the light for nearly ten minutes, and being tired with

kneeling on the pavement I supported part of my weight on my hands a
few inches in front of the scale. The place where my hands came was

on the bare earth fx-om which one of the paving stones had been removed.

I was surprised to find quite a large change in the reading. After

' Pogycndmfs Ainialni, 1843, vol. r,S, p. 437.
108 KEPOKT-- 1881.

several trials I found that the pressure of a few pounds with one hand only

was quite sufficient to produce an effect.

    It must be remembered that this is not a case of a small pressure

delivered on the bare earth at say 7 feet distance, but it is the difference

of effect produced by this pressure at 7 feet and 8 feet ; for of course the

change only consisted in the change of distribution in the weight of a

small portion of my body.

   We have, however, since shown that even this degree of sensitiveness

may be exceeded.

   We had thought all along that it would ultimately be necessary to

take our observations from outside the room, but this observation im-

pressed it on us more than ever ; for it would be impossible for an observer

always to stand in exactly the same position for taking readings, and my

brother and I could not take a set of readings together on account of the

difference between our weights.

    In making preliminary arrangements for reading from outside the

room we found the most convenient way of bringing the reflected image

into the field of view of the telescope was by shifting a weight about the

Myroom.    brother stood in the room and changed his position until the

image was in the field of view, and afterwards placed a heavy weight

where he had been standing ; after he had left the room the image was in

the field of view.

    On the S.W. wall of the room there is a trap-door or window which

opens into another room, and we determined to read from this.

    In order to read with a telescope the light has to undergo two reflec-

tions and twelve refractions, besides those in the telescope ; it has also to
pass twice through layers of water and of the fluid mixture. In con-

sequence of the loss of light we found it impossible to read the image of

an illuminated scale, and we had to make the scale self-luminous.
    On the pavement to the S. of the instrument is placed a flat board on

to  which  are  fixed a pair  of  rails                        a carriage  with  three  legs  slides  on
                                                            ;

these rails, and can be driven to and fro by a screw of ten threads to the

inch. Backlash in the nut which drives the carriage is avoided by means

Aof a spiral spring.   small gas-flame is attached to the carriage ; in front

of it is a piece of red glass, the vertical edge of which is very distinctly

visible in the telescope after reflection from the mirror. The red glass was

introduced to avoid prismatic effects, which had been troublesome before.

The edge of the glass was found to be a more convenient object than a

line which had been engraved on the glass as a fiducial mark.

    The gas-flame is caused to traverse by pulleys driven by cords. The

Acords come to the observing window, and can be worked from there.

second telescope is erected at the window, for reading certain scales

attached to the traversing gear of the carriage, and we find that we can

read the position of the gas-flame to within a tenth of an inch, or even

less, with certainty.

    From the gas the ray of light enters the tub and mirror-box, is

reflected by the mirror, and emerges by the same route ; it then meets a

looking-glass which reflects it nearly at right angles and a little upwards,

and finally enters the object-glass of the reading telescope, fixed to the

sill of the observing window.

    When the carriage is at the right part of the scale the edge of the

red glass coincides with the cross wire of the reading telescope, and the

reading is taken by means of the scale telescope.
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LCNAH DlSTDEBANCE OF GEAVITY. 109

     Arraugements had also to bo nii>de for working the sensitisev, cen-

ti'aliser, and disturber from outside the I'oom.

   A scafibldiug was erected over the tub, but free of contact therewith,

and this supported a system of worm-wheels, tangent screws, and pulleys
by which the three requisite movements could be given. The junctures
with the sensitising and centralising rods were purposely made loose,

becaiise it was found at first that a slight shake to the scaffolding

disturbed the pendulum.
     The pulleys on the scaffolding are driven by cords which pass to the

observing window.

    On the window-sill we now have two telescopes, four pulleys, an

arrangement, with a scale attached, for raising and depressing the guide

weight, and a gas tap for governing the flame in the room.
     After the arrangemeiits which have been described were completed we

sensitised the instrument from outside the room. The arrangements
worked so admirably that we could produce a quite extraordinary degree
of sensitiveness by the alternate working of the sensitising and central-
ising wheels, without ever causing the image of the lamp to disappear
from the field of view. This is a great improvement on the old arrange-

ment with the stone gallows.

   We now found that if one of us was in the room and stood at about

16 feet to the S. of the instrument with his feet about a foot apart, and

slowly shifted his weight from one foot to the other, then a distinct

change was produced in the position of the mirror. This is the most
remarkable proof of sensitiveness which we have yet seen, for the instru-

ment can detect the difierence between the distortion of the soil caused
Weby a weight of 140 lbs. placed at 16 feet and at 17 feet.
                                                             have not as

yet taken any great pains to make the instrument as sensitive as possible,

and we have little doubt but that we might exceed the present degree of

delicacy, if it were desirable to do so.

    The sensitiveness now attained is, we think, only apparently greater

than it was with the stone gallows, and depends on the improved optical

arrangements, and the increase of steadiness due to the elimination of

changes of temperature in the support.

    From July 21 to July 25 we took a series of readings. There was
evidence of a distinct diurnal period with a maximum about noon, when

the pendulum stood furthest northwards ; in the experiment with the

stone gallows in 1880 the maximum northern excursion took place

between 5 and 7 p.m.

    The path of the pendulum was interrupted by many minor zigzags,

and it wonld sometimes reverse its motion for nearly an hour together.
During the first four days the mean position of the pendulum travelled
southward, and the image went oS" the scale three times, so that we had
to recentralise it. In the night between the 24th and 25th it took an

abrupt turn northward, and the reading was found in the morning of the

25th at nearly the opposite end of the scale.

On the 25th the dance of the image was greater than we had seen it

at any time with the new instrument, so that we went into the room to

see whether the water had fallen in the tub and had left the top of the

copper tube exposed ; for on a previous occasion this had appeared to

produce much unsteadiness. There was, however, no change in the state

Aof affairs.  few days later the image was quite remarkable for its

steadiness.
no iiEroRT-- 1881.

On July 'J15, and again on the 27tL, we tried a series ot' observations

with the disturber, in order to determine the absolute value of the scale.

    The guide weight being at a known altitude in the copper tube we took

a series of six readings at intervals of a minute, and then shifting the
guide weight to another known altitude, took six more in a similar

manner ; and so on backwards and forwards for an hour.
     The first movement of the guide weight produced a considerable dis-

tu-rbance of an irregular character, and the first set of readings were
rejected. Afterwards there was more or less concordance between the
results, but it was to be noticed there was a systematic difierence

between the change from up' ' to ' down ' and ' down ' to ' up.' This

may perhaps be attributed to friction between certain parts of the

Weapparatus.  believe that on another occasion we might erect the dis-

turber under much more favourable conditions, but we do not feel sure

that it could ever be made to operate very satisfactorily.

The series of readings before and after the change of the guide weight

were taken in order to determine the path of the pendulum at the critical

moment ; but the behaviour of the pendulum is often so irregular, even

within a few minutes, that the discrepancy between the several results

and the apparent systematic error may be largely due to unknown

changes, which took place during the minute which necessarily elapsed

between the last of one set of readings and the first of the next. The

image took up its new position deliberately, and it was necessary to wait

until it had come to its normal position.

     Between the first and second set of observations with the disturber, it

Wehad been necessary to enter the room and to recentralise the image.

do not know whether something may not have disturbed the degree of

sensitiveness, but at any rate the results of the two sets of observations

are very discordant.'

The first set showed that one inch of movement of the gas-flame,

which formed the scale, corresponds with -i^th. of a second of arc of

change of  horizon                                             the second gave j^th of  a second to the inch.
                                                            ;

As we can see a twentieth of an inch in the scale, it follows that a

change of horizon of about 0"'00.5 should be distinctly visible. In this

case the point of the pendulum moves through ^^^ J-y ^th of a millimeter.
At present we do not think that the disturber gives more than the order

of the changes of horizon which wo note, but our estimate receives a

general confirmation frona another circumstance.

From the delicacy of the gearing connected with the back-leg, we

estimate that it is by no means difficult to raise the back-leg by a

millionth of an inch. The looseness in the gearing was purposely kept

so great that it requires a turn or two of the external pulley on the

window-sill before the backlash is absorbed, but after this a very small

fraction of a turn is sufficient to move the image in the field.

   We are now inclined to look to this pi'ocess with the back-leg to

enable us to determine the actual value of our scale, but this will require

a certain amount of new apparatus, which we have not yet had time to
arrange. In erecting the instrument we omitted to take certain measure-

ments which it now appears will be necessary for the use of the back-leg
as a means of determining the absolute value of our scale, but we know

these measurements appi'oximately from the working drawings of the

instrument. Now it appears that one complete revolution of a certain

tangent-screw by which the back-leg is raised should tilt the pendulum-

stand through almost exactly half a second of arc, and therefore this

should produce a relative displacement of the pendulum of the same
Weamount.
             have no doubt but tliat a tenth of the turn of the tangent-

screw produces quite a large deflection of the image, and probably a
hundredth of a turn would produce a sensible deflection. Therefore,

from mere consideration of the effect of the back-leg wc do not doubt
but that a deflection of the pendulum through a ^liotli of a second of

arc is distinctly visible. This affords a kind of confirmation of the

somewhat unsatisfactory deductions which we draw from the operation

--of the disturber.
     Posfscrijyf. The account of our more recent experiments was written
during an absence from Cambridge from July 29 to August 9. In this

period the gradual southerly progression of the pendulum-bob, which was
observed up to July 28, seems to have continued ; for on August 9 the

pendulum was much too far S. to permit the image of the gas-flame to
come into the field of view of the telescope. On August 9 the image was

recentralised, and on the 9th and 10th the southerly change continued

on the 11th, however, a reversal northwards again occurred. Durino-

these days the unsteadiness of the image was much greater than we have

seen it at any time with the new instrument. There was some heavy

Werain and a good deal of wind at that time.  intend to arrange a scale

for giving a numerical value to the degree of unsteadiness, but at present

it is merely a matter of judgment.

     It seems possible that earthquakes were the cause of unsteadiness on

August 9, 10, and 11, and we shall no doubt hear whether any earth-

quakes have taken place on those days.

    After August 11 we were both again absent from Cambridge. On
August 16 my brother returned, and found that the southerly progression

of the pendulum-bob had reasserted itself, so that the image was again

far out of the field of view. After recentralising he found the image to
be unusually steady.

This appeared a good opportunity of trying the effect of purely local

tremors.

     One observer therefore went into the room and, standing near the
instrument, delivered some smart blows on the brickwork copino- round
the ditch, the stone pavement, the tub, and the large stone basement
underneath the water. Little or no effect was produced by this. Very
small movements of the body, such as leaning forward while sitting in a

chair, or a shift of part of the weight from heels to toes, produced a
sensible deflection, audit was not very easy for the experimenter to avoid
this kind of change whilst delivering the blows. To show the sensitiveness

of the instrument to steady pressure we may mention that a pressure

of three fingers on the brick coping of the ditch produces a marked

deflection.

    On August 17 1 returned to Cambridge, and noted, with my brother,

that the image had never been nearly so steady before. The abnormal

steadiness continued on the 18th. There was much rain during those days.
    On the afternoon of the 19th there was a high wind, and although

the abnormal steadiness had ceased, still the agitation of the image was
rather less than we usually observe it.

     The image being so steady on the 1 J'th, we thought that a good oppor-
112 REPORT-- 1881.

tunifcy was afforded for testing the disturber. At G.16 P.M. of that day
we began the readings. The changes from ' up ' to ' down ' were made as
quickly as we could, and in a quarter of an hour we secured five readings
when the guide weight was 'up,' and four when it was 'down.'

    When a curve was drawn, with the time as abscissa, and the readings

as ordinates, through the 'up's,' and similarly through the 'down's,' the
curves presented similar features. This seems to show that movement of
the disturber does not cause irregularities or changes, except such as it

is designed to produce.

     The displacement of the guide weight was through 5 cm. on each

occasion.

     The four changes from ' up ' to ' down ' showed that an inch of scale
corresponded with 0"-0897, with a mean error of 0"'0021 ; the four from
'down' to 'up' gave 0"'0909 to the inch, with a mean error of 0"-0042.
Thus the systematic error on the previous occasions was probably only

apparent.

     Including all the eight changes together, we find that the value of an
inch is 0"-0903 with a mean error of 0"-00r!0.

    A change in the scale reading amounting to a tenth of an inch is

visible without any doubt, and even less is probably visible. Now it will

give an idea of the delicacy of the instrument when we say that a tenth

of an inch of our scale corresponds to a change of horizon ' through an
angle equal to that subtended by an inch at 384 miles.

         OnII. the luorJc of previozis observers.

     In the following section we propose to give an account of the various
experiments which have been made in order to detect small variations of
horizon, as far as they are known to us ; but it is probable that other
papers of a similar kind may have escaped our notice.

     In a report of this kind it is useful to have references collected
together, and therefore, besides giving an account of the papers which

we have consulted, we shall requote the references contained in these

papers.

In Poggendorf's ' Annalen ' for 1873 there are papers by Professor

P. ZoUner, which had been previously read before the Royal Saxon

Society, and which are entitled ' Ueber eine neue Methode zur Messung

anziehender und abstossender Krafte,' vol. 150, p. 131, ' Beschreibung und

AAnwendung des Horizontalpendels,' vol. 150, p. 134.   part of the

second of these papers is translated, and the figure is reproduced in the

supplementary number of the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for 1872, p. 491,

in a paper ' On the Origin of the Earth's Magnetism.'

The horizontal pendulum was independently invented by Professor

Zollner, and, notwithstanding assertions to the contrary, was probably for

the first time actually realised by him ; it appears, however, that it had

been twice invented before. The history of the instrument contains a

curious piece of scientific fraud, of which we shall give an account below.

The instrument underwent some modifications under the hands of

Professor Zollner, and the two forms are described in the above papers.

    · We use the expression ' change of horizon ' to denote relative movement of

the earth, at the place of observation, and the plumb-line. Such changes may arise

either from alteration in the shape of the earth, or from displacement of the plumb-

line ; our experiments do not determine which of these two really takes place.
     ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GHAVITT. 113

   --The principle employed is as follows : There is a very stout vertical

stand, supported on three legs. At the top and bottom of the vertical
shaft are fixed two projections. Attached to each projection is a fine

straight steel clock spring ; the springs are parallel to the vertical shaft
of the stand, the one attached to the lower projection running upwards,

and that attached to the upper one running downwards. The springs
are of equal length, each being equal to half the distance between their
points of attachment on the projections.

     The springs terminate in a pair of rings, which stand exactly opposite

to one another, so that a rod may be thrust through both.

   A glass rod has a heavy weight attached to one end of it, and the

other end is thrust through the two rings. The rings are a little separated
from one another, and the glass rod stands out horizontally, with its
weight at the end, and is supjDorted by the tension of the two springs.
It is obvious that if the point of attachment of the upper spring were
vertically over that of the lower spring, and if the springs had no
torsional elasticity, then the glass rod would be in neutral equilibrium,
and would stand equally well in any azimuth.

     The springs being thin have but little torsional elasticity, and
Professor ZoUner arranges the instrument so that the one support is very
nearly over the other. In consequence of this the rod and weight have
but a small predilection for one azimuth more than another. The free
oscillations of the hox^zontal pendulum could thus be made extra-
ordinarily slow ; and even a complete period of one minute could be easily

attained.

   A very small horizontal foi'ce of course produces a large deflection of

the pendulum, and a small deflection of the force of gravitation with

reference to the instrument must produce a like result. He considers

that by this instrument ho could, in the first form of the instrument,
detect a displacement of the horizon through 0"'00035 ; in the second his

estimate is 0"-001.

     The observation was made by moans of a mirror attached to the
weight, and scale and telescope.

    The maximum change of level due to the moon's attraction is at St.

Petersburg 0"-0174., and from the sun 0"-0080 [C. A. T. Peters, 'Bull.
Acad. Imp. St. Petersbourg,' 1844, vol. 3. No. 14] ; and thus the insti-a-
ment was amply sensitive enough to detect the lunar and solar disturb-

ances of gravity.*

   Professor ZoUner found, as we have done, that the readings were never
the same for two successive instants. The passing of trains on the rail-
way at a mile distant produced oscillations of the equilibrium position.

We' are of opinion that M. Zijllner has made a mistake in using at Leipsig

Peters' results for St. Petersbiarg. Besides this he considers the changes of tlie

vertical to be 0'''017i on eacli side of a mean position, and thus sa^'s the change is

0"'0348 altogether. Now a rough computation which I have made for Cambridge
shows that the maximum meridional horizontal component of gravitation, as due to

lunar attraction, is 4'12 x 10"'* of pure gravit}'. This force will produce a dellec-

tion of the plumb-line of 0"'00S."), and the total amplitude of meridional oscillation

will be 0"'0170. The maximum detiection of the plumb line occurs when the

moon's hour-angle is ± 45° and ± 135° at the place of observation. The change at

Cambridge when the moon is S.E. and N.W. ^s 0''-0l'16. The deflection of the plumb

line varies as the cosine of the latitude, and is therefore greater at Cambridge than at

St. Petersburg. Multiplying 021!} by sec 51-43' cos 60° we get -0174, and thus my

calculation agrees with Peters'.

He seems to have failed to detect the laws governing the longer and

wider oscillations performed. Notwithstanding that he took a number of
precautions against the effects of changes of temperature, he remarks
that 'the external circumstances under which the above experiments
were carried out must be characterised as extremely unfavourable for this
object (measuring the lunar attraction), so that the sensitiveness might be
much increased in pits in the ground, provided the reaction of the glowing

molten interior against the solid crust do not generate inequalities of the

same order.'

Further on he says that if the displacements of the pendulum should

be found not to agree in phase with the theoretical phase as given by the

sun's position, then it might be concluded that gravitation must take a

finite time to come from the sun.

It appears to me that such a result would afford strong grounds for

presuming the existence of frictional tides in the solid earth, and that

Professor Zollner's conclusion would be quite unjustifiable.

Earlier in the paper he states that he preferred to construct his instru-

ment on a large scale, in order to avoid the disturbing effects of convection

Wecurrents.   cannot but think, from our own experience, that by this

course Professor Zollner lost more than he gained, for the larger the

instrument the more it would necessarily be exposed in its various parts

to regions of different temperature, and we have found that the warping

of supports by inequalities of temperatui'e is a most serious cause of

disturbance.

    The instrument of which we have given a short account appears to us

very interesting from its ingenuity, and the account of the attempts to

use it are well worthy of attention, but we cannot think that it can ever
be made to give such good results as those which may perhaps be attained
by our plan or by others. The variation in the torsional elasticity of the

suspending springs, due to changes of temperature, would seem likely to

produce serious variations in the value of the displacements of the pendu-
lum, and it does not seem easy to suspend such an instrument in fluid in
such a manner as to kill out the effects of purely local tremors.

      Moreover, the whole instrument is kept permanently in a condition of

great stress, and one would be inclined to suppose that the vertical stand
would be slightly warped by the variation of direction in which the
tensions of the springs are applied, when the pendulum bob varies its

position.

     In a further paper in the same volume, p. 140, ' Zur Geschichte
des Horizontalpendels,' Zollner gives the priority of invention to M.
Perrot, who had described a similar instrument on March 31, 1862,
(' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 54, p. 728), but as far as he knows M. Perrot

did not actually construct it.

    He also quotes an account of an ' Astronomische Pendelwage,' by

Lorenz Hengler, published in 1832, in vol. 43 of ' Dingler's Polytechn.
Journ.,' pp. 81-92. In this paper it appears that Hengler gives the
most astonishing and vague accounts of the manner in which he detected
the lunar attraction with a horizontal pendulum, the points of support

being the ceiling and floor of a room 16 feet high. The terrestrial rotation
was also detected with a still more marvellous instrument.

      Zollner obviously discredits these experiments, but hesitates to
characterise them, as ihey deserve, as mere fraud and invention.

     The university authorities at Munich state that in the years 1830-1
ON THE MEASUREMENT OP THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 115

there was a candidate in philosophy and theology named Lorenz Hengler,
of Reichenhofen, ' der weder friiher noch spater zu finden ist.'

    At p. 150 of the same volume Professor Safarik contributes a 'Bei-

trag zur Geschichte des Horizontalpendels.' He says that the instru-

ment takes its origin from Professor Gruithuisen, of Munich, whose

name has ' keinen guten Klang ' in the exact sciences.
     This strange person, amongst other eccentricities, proposed to dig a

hole quite through the earth, and proposes a catachthonic observatory.
Gruithuisen says, in his ' Neuen Analekten fiir Brd- und Himmelskunde '

(Munich, 1832), vol. 1, part i. : ' I believe that the oscillating-balance

(Schwung-wage) of a pupil of mine (named Hengeller), when constructed

on a large scale, will do the best service.'

Some of the most interesting observations which have been made

are those of M. d'Abbadie. He gave an account of his experiments in a

paper, entitled ' fitudes sur la verticale,' ' Association Fran9aise pour

I'avancement des Sciences, Congres de Bordeaux, 1872,' p. 159. As this

work is not very easily accessible to English readers, and as the paper

itself has much interest, we give a somewhat full abstract of it. He has

also published two short notes with reference to M. Plantamour's obser-

vations (noticed below), in vol. 86, p. 1528 (1878), and vol. 89, p. 1016

We(1879), of the ' Comptes Rendus.'          shall incorporate the substance of

his remarks in these notes in our account of the original paper.

When at Olinda, in Brazil, in 1837, M. d'Abbadie noticed the varia-

tions of a delicate level which took place from day to day. At the end of

the two months of his stay there the changes in the E. and W. azimuth

had compensated themselves, and the level was in the same condition as

at first ; but the change in the meridian was still progressing when he

had to leave.
     In 1842, at Gondar, in Ethiopia, and at Saqa, he noticed a similar

thing. In 1852 he gave an account to the French Academy (' Comptes
Rendus,' May, p. 712) of these observations, as well as of others, by

means of levels, which were carried out in a cellar in the old castle of

Audaux, Basses Pyrenees.

     Leverrier, he says, speaks of sudden changes taking place in the level

of astronomical instruments, apparently without cause. Airy has proved

that the azimuth of an instrument may change, and Hough notes, in

America, capricious changes of the Nadir.

    Henry has collected a series of levellings and azimuths observed at
Greenwich during ten years, and during eight of the same years at Cam-

bridge ('Monthly Notices, R.A.S.,' vol. 8, p. 134). The results with
respect to these two places present a general agreement, and show that

Tfrom March to September the western of the transit instrument falls

through 2"-5, whilst it deviates at the same time 2" towards the north.

Elhs has made a comparison of curves applying to Greenwich, during

eight years, for level and azimuth. He shows that there is a general

correspondence with the curves of the external temperature (' Memoirs

of the R. Ast. Soc.,' vol. 29, pp. 45-57).

    In the later papers M. d'Abbadie says that M. Bouquet de la Grye

has observed similar disturbances of the vertical at Campbell Island,

lat. 52° 34' S.. M. Bouquet used a heavy pendulum governing a

vertical lever, by which the angle was multiplied.' He found that the

116 REPORT--1881.

great breakers on the shore at a distance of two miles caused a deviation

of the vertical of l"'l. On one occasion the vertical seems to have varied

through 3" '2 in 3| hours.

     M. d'Abbadie also quotes Elkin, Yvon Villarceau, and Airy as having

found, from astronomical observations, notable variations in latitude,
amounting to from 7" to 8".

     As M. d'Abbadie did not consider levels to afford a satisfactory
method of observation of the presumed changes of horizon, he deter-
mined to proceed in a different manner.

     The site of his experiments was Abbadia, in Subernoa, near Hendaye.
The Atlantic was 400 meters distant, and the sea level 62 meters below
the place of observation. The subsoil was loamy rock (joclie marneuse),
belonging to ci-etaceous deposits of the South of France. Notwithstanding
the steep slope of the soil, water was found at about 5 meters below the

surface.

     In this situation he had built, in 1863, a concrete cone, of which tho
external slope was one in ten (una inclinaison d'une dixieme). The con-
crete cone is truncated, and the flat surface at the top is 2 meters in

diameter. It is pierced down the centre by a vertical hole or well

1 meter in diameter. This well extends to within half a meter of the top,

at which point the concrete closes in, leaving only a hole of 12 centi-
meters up to the flat upper surface.

    From the top of the concrete down to the rock is 8 meters, and the

well is continued into the rock to a further depth of 2 meters : thus

from top to bottom is 10 meters.

    A tunnel is made to the bottom of the well in order to drain away the

water, and access of the observer to the bottom is permitted by means of
an underground staircase. Access can also be obtained to a point half.
way between the top and bottom by means of a hole through the con-
crete. At this point there is a diaphragm across the well, pierced by a
hole 21 centimeters in diameter. The diaphragm seems to have been
originally made in order to support a lens, but the mode of observation
was afterwards changed. The diaphragm is still useful, however, for
allowing the observer to stand there and sweep away cobwebs.

     The cone is enclosed in an external building, from the roof of which,

as I understand, there hangs a platform on which the observer may

stand without touching the cone ; and the two staircases leading up to

the top are also isolated.'

    On the hole through the top of the cone is riveted a disk of brass
pierced through its centre by a circular hole 21 mm. in diameter. The

hole in the disk is traversed across two perpendicular diameters by fine
platinum wires ; at first there were only two wires, but afterwards there
were four, which were arranged so as to present the outline of a right-
angled cross. The parallel wires were very close together, so that the
four wires enclosed in the centre a very small square space.

     At the bottom of the well is put a pool of mercury. The mercury
was at first in an iron basin, but the agitation of the mercury was found
sometimes to be so great that no reflection was visible for an hour to-

been made with pendulums in Italy, but that it does not distinctly appear that the

variations of level are simultaneous over wide areas. No reference is given as to

the observers.

gether. At the suggestion of Leverrier the iron basin -was replaced by
a shallow wooden tray with a corrugated bottom, and a good reflection
was then generally obtainable. Immediately over the mercury pool
there stood a lens of 10 cm. diameter and 10 meters focal length,
and over the brass disk there stood a microscope with moveable mi-
crometer wires in the eyepiece, and a jaosition circle. The platinum

wires were illuminated, and on looking through the microscope the

observer saw the wires both directly and by reflection. The observations

were taken by measuring the azimuth and displacement of the image of

the central square relatively to the real square enclosed by the wires.

One division of the micrometer screw indicated a displacement of

vertical of 0"'03, so that the observations were susceptible of consider-

able refinement.

The whole of the masonry was finished in 1863, and M. d'Abbadie

then allowed the structure five years to settle before he began taking

observations. The arrangements for observing above described were

made in 1868 and 1869.

In the course of a year he secured 2,000 observations, and the results

appear to be very strange and capricious.

     Throughout March, 1869, the perturbations of the mercury were so
incessant, that observations (taken at that time with the iron basin) were

nearly impossible                                                                               on the 29th he waited nearly an hour in vain in trying
                                                                                             ;

to catch the image of the wires. Two days later the mercury was

perfectly tranquil. On April 6 it was much agitated, although the air

Aand sea were calm.                                                                             tranquil surface was a rare exception.

In 1870 the       corrugated                                                                    trough  was  substituted  for  the      iron  basin
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and M. d'Abbadie says :

' Cependant, ni le fond inegal du bain rainc ni sa forme ne m'ont

empeche d'observer, ce que j'appelle des ombres fuyantes. Ce sent des

bandes sombres et paralleles qui traversent le champ du microscope avec

plus ou moins de vitesse, et qu'on explique en attribuant au mercure des

ondes tres tenues, causees par une oscillation du sol dans tin seul sens.

Le plus souvent ces ombres semblent courir du S.E. au N.O., appi'oxi-

mativement selon I'axe de la chaine des Pyrenees ; mais je les ai obser-

Avees, le 15 Mars 1872, allant vers Ic S.O.                                                                  cette epoque le mercm^e

etait, depuis le 29 fevrier, dans une agitation continuelle, comme mon

aide I'avait constate en 1869, aussi dans le mois de Mars.''

    He observed also, from time to time, certain oscillations of the

mercury too rapid to be counted, which he calls ' tremoussements.'

There were also sudden jumpings of the image from one point to another,
or ' fretillements,' indicating a sudden change of vertical through 0"'49

to 0"-65.

    He observed many microscopic earthquakes, and in some cases the

image was carried quite out of the field of view.

    He also detected the difference of vertical according to the- state

of the tide in the neighbouring sea ; but the change of level due to this
cause was often masked by others occurring contemporaneously.

    From observations during the years 1867 to 1872 (with the exception

of 1870) he finds that in every year but one the plumb-line deviated

northwards during the latter months of the year, but in 1872 it deviated

to the south.

    ' M. d'Abbadie writes to me that this phenomenon was ultimately found to

result from air-currents (Nov. 6, 1881).
118 REPORT-- 1881.

He does not give any theoretical views as to the causes of these

phenomena, but remarks that his observations tend to prove that the

causes of change are sometimes neither astronomical nor thermometrical.

     The most sudden change which he noted was on October 27, 1872,
when the vertical changed by 2"'4 in six hours and a quarter. Between
January 30 and March 26 of the same year the plumb-line deviated 4"'5

towards the south.

   We now come to the valuable observations of M. Plantamour, which

we believe are still being prosecuted by him. His papers are ' Sur le

deplacement de la bulle des niveaux a bulle d'air,' ' Comptes Rendus,'

June 24, 1878, vol. 86, p. 1522, and ' Des mouvements periodiques du

1879, vol. 89, p. 937.

    The observations were made at Secheron, near Geneva, at first at the

Observatory, and afterwards at M. Plantamour's house. After some

preliminary observations he obtained a very sensitive level and laid it on
the concrete floor of a room in which the variations of temperature were

very small. The azimuth of the level was E. and W., and the observa-
tions were made every hour from 9 a.m. until midnight. Figures are

given of the displacement of the bubble during April 24, 25, and 26, 1878.

The results indicate a diurnal oscillation of level, the E. end of the level

being highest towards 5.30 p.m. ; the amplitudes of the oscillations were
8""4, ll"-2, 15"'75 during these three days. It also appeared that there

was a gradual rising of the mean diurnal position of the E. end during

the same time.

The level was then transported to a cellar in M. Plantamour's

house, when the temperature only varied by half a degree centigrade.

AThe bubble of the level often ran quite up to one end.  new and larger

level was obtained, together with the great 'chevalet de fer,' which is
used by the manufacturers in testing levels. Both levels were placed E.

and W., at about two meters apart. During May 3 and 4, 1878, the
bubble travelled eastward without much return, and it is interesting to

learn that simultaneous observations by M. Turretini, at the Level

Factory, three kilometers distant, at Plainpalais, showed a similar

change.

    Between May 3 and 6 the level actually changed through 17". Up

to the 19th the level still showed the eastward change.
     M. Plantamour remarks that the eastern pier of a transit instrument

is known to rise during a part of the year, but not by an amount com-

parable with that observed by him, and that the diurnal variations are

unknown.

After further observations of a similar kind one of the levels waa

arranged in the N. and S. azimuth.
     The same sort of diurnal oscillations, although more irregular, were

observed, but the hours of maximum were not the same in the two levels.
During the four days May 24 to 28 the maximum rising of the north

generally took place about noon. This is exactly the converse of what
we have recently observed.

In the second paper he remarks :
* Dans le sens du meridien, les mouvements diurnes sont tres rares

irreguliers et toujours tres faibles, le niveau en accuse parfois, quand il

n'y en a point de Test a I'ouest, et inversement, quand ces derniers sont

tres prononces, on n'en aper9oit que tres rarement du sud au nord.'
ON THE MEASDEEMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OF aRAYITY. 119

In our experiment of March 16 to 18, 1880, we found tliat the

pendulum stood furthest north about 6 p.m., so that at that time the S.

was most elevated ; and in the short series of observations during the

present summer the maximum elevation of the S. took place about noon.

On October 1, 1878, M. Plantamour began a new series of observa-

tions, which lasted until September 30, 1879. The levels were arranged

in the two azimuths as before, and the observations were taken five times

a day, namely, at 9 a.m., noon, 3, 6, and 9 p.m. The mean of these five

readings he takes as the diurnal value.

During October and November the eastern end of the level fell, which

is exactly the converse of what happened during the spring of the same

year ; he concludes that the eastern end falls when the external tempera-

ture falls.

When a curve of the external temperature was placed parallel with

that for the level, it appeared that there was a parallelism between the

two, but the curve for the level lagged behind that for temperature by a

period of from one to four days.

This parallelism was maintained until the end of June, 1879, when it

became disturbed. From then until the beginning of September the E.

rose, but in a much greater proportion than the rise of mean temperature.

It must be noted that July was a cold and wet month.

Although the external temperature began to fall on August 5, the

E. end continued to rise until September 8. This he attributes to an

accumulation of heat in the soil. The total amplitude of the annual

oscillation from E. to W. amounted to 28"'08.

There was also a diurnal oscillation in this azimuth which amounted

to 3""2 on September 5. The east end appeared to be highest between 6

and 7.45 p.m., and lowest at the similar hour in the mox'ning.'

The meridional oscillations were much smaller, the total annual

amplitude being only 4"-89. From December 23, 1878, until the end of

April, 1879, there was a correspondence between the external temperature

Wecurve and that for N. and S. level.    have already quoted the remark

on the diurnal meridional oscillations.

M. Plantamour tells us that in 1856 Admiral Mouchez detected no

movement of the soil by means of the levels attached to astronomical

instruments. On the other hand, M. Hirsch established, by several years

of observation at Neuchatel, that there was an annual oscillation of

a transit instrument from E. to W., with an amplitude of 23", and an

azimuthal oscillation of 75", Similar observations with the transit

instrument were made at the observatory at Berne in the summer of 1879.

It is to be regretted that M. Plantamour does not give us more

information concerning the manner in which the iron support for the

levels was protected from small changes of temperature, nor with regard

Weto the effect of the observer's weight on the floor of the room.  have

concluded that both these sources of distui'bance should be carefully

eliminated.

    ' It seems that M. Plantamour sent a figure to the French Academy with the
paper, but no figure is given. This figure would doubtless have explained the mean-
ing of some passages which are somewhat obscure. Thus he speaks of the mitii-

mwn occurring between 6 and 7.45, but it is not clear whether minimum means E.

highest or E. lowest. Hinterpret the passage as above, because this was the state of

things in the observations recorded in the first of the two papers. There is a similar

difficulty about the meridional oscillatious.
120 HEPORT-- 188L

Some interesting otDservations were made at Pulkova on a subject

cognate to that on which we are writing. M. Magnus Nyren contributed,

on February 28, 1878, an interesting note to the Imperial Academy of

St. Petersburg, entitled ' Erderschiitterung beobaclitet an einem feinem

Niveau 1877 Mai 10.'' On May 10 (April 28), 1877, at 4.16 A.M.,

a striking disturbance of the level on the axis of the transit was observed

by M. Nyren in the observatory at Pulkova. The oscillations were

watched    by  him  for  three                    minutes                                        their complete period was about
                                                                                              ;

20 seconds, and their amplitude between 1"'5 and 2". At '±.35 a.m.

there was no longer any disturbance. He draws attention to the

fact that it afterwards appeared that one hour and fourteen minutes

earlier there had been a great earthquake at Iquique. The distance

from Iquique to Pulkova is 10,600 kilometers in a straight line, and

12,640 kilometers along the arc of a great circle. He does not posi-

tively connect the two phenomena together ; but he observes that if

the wave came through the earth from Iquique to Pulkova it must have

travelled at the rate of about 2'4 kilometers per second. This is the

speed of transmission through platinum or silver.

M. Nyren thinks the wave-motion could not have been so regular

as it was, if the transmission had been through the solid, and suggests

that the transmission was through the fluid interior of the earth.

It appears to us that this argument is hardly sound, and that it would

be more just to conclude that the interior of the earth was a sensibly

perfectly  elastic  solid                         because  oscillations                          in  molten rock would surely
                                               ;

be more quickly killed out by internal friction than those in a solid.

However, M. Nyren does not lay much stress on this argument. He

also draws attention to the fact that on September 20 (8), 1867,

M. Wagner observed at Pulkova an oscillation of the level, with an

amplitude of 3", and that seven minutes before the disturbance there

had been an earthquake at Malta. On April 4 (March 23), 1868, M.

Gromadzki observed an agitation of the level, and it was afterwards

found that there had been an earthquake in Turkestan five minutes before.

Similar observations of disturbances had been made twice before,

--once by M. Wagner and once by M. Romberg ; but they had not been

connected with any earthquakes at least with certainty.

    Dr. C. W. Siemens has invented an instrument of extraordinary
delicacy, which he calls an 'Attraction-meter.' An account of the

instrument is given in an addendum to his paper ' On determining the

depth of the sea without the use of the sounding-line' (' Phil. Trans.,'

We1876, p. 659).    shall not give any account of this instrument, because

Dr. Siemens is a member of our committee, and will doubtless bring any

observations he may make with it before the British Association at some

future time.

    Although our experiments are not yet concluded, it may be well to
make a few remarks on the present aspects of the question, and to state

shortly our intentions as to future operations.

    Our experiments, as far as they go, confirm the results of MM.

d'Abbadie and Plantamour, and we think that there can remain little

                                      ' Bull. Acad. St. Pet., vol. 24, p, 567.

doubt that the surface of the earth is in incessant movement, -with
oscillations of periods extending from a fraction of a second to a year.

     Whether it be a purely superficial phenomenon or not, this considera-

tion should be of importance to astronomical observers, for their instru-

ments are necessarily placed at the surface of the earth. M. Plantamour
and others have shown that there is an intimate connection between the
changes of level and those of the temperature of the air ; whence it follows

that the principal part of the changes must be superficial. On the other

hand, M. d'Abbadie has shown that it is impossible to explain all the
changes by means of changes of temperature. It would be interesting
to determine whether changes of a similar kind penetrate to the bottom

of mines, and Gruithuisen's suggestion of a catachthonic observatory

seems worthy of attention, although he perhaps went rather far in the
proposition that the observatory should be ten or fifteen miles below the

earth's surface.

It may appear not improbable that the surface of the soil becomes

wrinkled all over, when it is swollen by increase of temperature and by

rainfall. If this, however, were the case, then we should expect that

instruments erected at a short distance apart would show discordant re-

sults. M. Plantamour, however, found that, at least during three days,

there was a nearly perfect accordance between the behaviour of two sets

of levels at three kilometers apart ; and during eight years there appeared

to be general agreement between the changes of level of the astrono-

mical instruments at Greenwich and Cambridge. It would be a matter

of much interest to determine how far this concordance would be main-

tained if the instrument of observation had been as delicate as that used

by M. d'Abbadie or as our pendulum.

M. Plantamour speaks as though it were generally recognised that

one pier of a transit circle rises during one part of the year and falls at

another.' But if this be so throughout Europe, we must suppose that

there is a kind   of  tide in  the  solid  earth, produced  by climatic  changes
                                                                                                                ;

the rise and fall of the central parts of continents must then amount to

something considerable in vertical height, and the changes of level on the

easterly and westerly coasts of a continent must be exactly opposite to

Weone another.        are not aware that any comparison of this kind has

been undertaken. The idea seems of course exceedingly improbable, but

we understand it to be alleged that it is the eastern pier of transit instru-

ments in Europe which rises during the warmer part of the year. Now

if this be generally true for Europe, which has no easterly coast, it

is not easy to see how the change can be brought about except by a

swelling of the whole continent.

   We suggest that in the future it will be thought necessary to erect

at each station a delicate instrument for the continuous observation of

changes of level. Perhaps M. d'Abbadie's pool of mercury might be best
for the longer inequalities, and something like our pendulum for the
shorter ones ; or possibly the pendulum when used in a manner which
we intend to try might suflfice for all the inequalities.

122 EEPORT-- 1881.

At present the errors introduced by unknown inequalities of level are

probably nearly eliminated by tbe number of observations taken ; but it

could not fail to diminish the probable error of each observation, if a

correction were applied for this cause of disturbance from hour to hour,

or even from minute to minute. If the changes noted by M. Plantamour

are not entirely abnormal in amount, such corrections are certainly suffi-

cient to merit attention.

    In our first set of experiments we found that stone piers are exceed-

ingly sensitive to changes of temperature and to small stresses. Might it

not be worth while to plate the piers of astronomical instruments with

Wecopper, and to swathe them with flannel ?    are not aware as to the

extent to which care is taken as to the drainage of the soil round the

piers, or as to the effect of the weight of the observer's body but we draw

attention to the effect produced by the percolation of water round the

basement, and to the impossibility we have found of taking our obser-

vations in the same room with the instrument.

    In connection with this subject we may notice an experiment which

was begun 3^ years ago by my brother Horace. The experiment was
undertaken in connection with my father's investigation of the geological

activity of earthworms, and the object was to determine the rate at which

stones are being buried in the ground in consequence of the excavations

of worms.

The experiment is going on at Down, in Kent. The soil is stiff red

clay, containing many flints lying over the chalk. There are two stout

metal rods, one of iron and the other of copper. The ends were

sharpened and they were hammered down vertically into the soil of an

old grass field, and they are in contact with one another, or nearly so.

When they had penetrated 8 feet 6 inches it was found very difficult to

force them deeper, and it is probable that the ends are resting on a flint.

The ends were then cut off about three inches above the ground.

   A stone was obtained like a small grindstone, with a circular hole in

the middle. This stone was laid on the ground with the two metal rods

Vappearing through the hole. Three brass grooves are leaded into the

upper surface of the stone, and a moveable tripod-stand with three

rounded legs can be placed on the stone, and is, of course, geometrically

fixed by the nature of its contact with the Vs. An arrangement with a

micrometer screw enables the observer to take contact measurements of

the position of the upper surface of the stone with regard to the rods.

The stone has always continued to fall, but during the first few months

the rate of fall was probably influenced by the decaying of the grass

underneath it. The general falling of the stone can only be gathered

from observations taken at many months apart, for it is found to be in a

state of continual vertical oscillation.

     The measurements are so delicate that the raising of the stone pro-

duced by one or two cans full of water poured on the ground can easily

be perceived. Between September 7 and 19, 1880, there was heavy rain,

and the stone stood 1*91 mm. higher at the latter date than at the former.

The effect of frost and the wet season combined is still more marked, for

on January 23, 1881, the stone was 4'12 mm. higher than it had been on

September 7, 1880.

    The prolonged drought of the present summer has had a great effect,

for between May 8 and June 29 the stone sank through 5-79 mm. The

opposite effects of drought and frost are well shown by the fact that on
ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LUNAR DISTURBANCE OP GRAVITY. 123

January 23 the stone stood 8*62 mm. higher than on June 2t), 1881.

The observations are uncorrected for the eifect of temperature on the
metal rods, but the fact that the readings from the two rods of different
metals always agree very closely inter se, shows that such a correction
would amount to very little.

     The changes produced in the height of the stone are, of course,
entirely due to superficial causes ; but the amounts of the oscillations

are certainly surprising, and although the basements of astronomical

instruments may be very deep, they cannot entirely escape from similar

oscillations.

     In his address to the mathematical section at the meeting of the

British Association at Glasgow in 1876, Sir William Thomson tells
us' that Peters, Maxwell, Nyren, and Newcomb^ have examined the
observations at Pulkova, Greenwich, and Washington, in order to discover

whether there is not an inequality in the latitude of the observatories
having a period of aboat 306 days. Such an inequality must exist on
account of the motion in that period of the instantaneous axis of rotation

of the earth round the axis of maximum moment of inertia. The in-

equality was detected in the results, but the probable error was very
large, and the epochs deduced by the several investigators do not agree
inter se. It remains, therefore, quite uncertain whether the detection of

the inequality is a reality or not. But now we ask whether it is not an
essential first step in such an enquiry to make an elaborate investigation
by a very delicate instrument of the systematic changes of vertical at each

station of observation ?

   We will next attempt to analyse the merits and demerits of the various

methods which have been employed for detecting small changes in the

vertical.

The most sensitive instrument is probably the horizontal pendulum of

Professor ZoUner, and its refinement might be almost indefinitely in-

creased by the addition of the bifilar suspension of a mirror as a means of

exliibiting the displacements of the pendulum-bob. If this were done it

might be possible to construct the instrument on a very small scale and

Weyet to retain a very high degree of sensitiveness.  are inclined to

think, however, that the variation of the torsional elasticity of the sus-

pending springs under varying temperature presents an objection to the

instrument which it would be very difficult to remove. The state of

stress under which the instrument is of necessity permanently retained

seems likely to be prejudicial.

Next in order of sensitiveness is probably our own pendulum, em-

Webodying the suggestion of Sir William Thomson.      are scarcely in a

position as yet to feel sure as to its merits, but it certainly seems to be

Wecapable of all the requisite refinement.  shall give below the ideas

which our experience, up to the present time, suggest as to improvements

and future observations.

Although we know none of the details of M. Bouquet de la Grye's

pendulum actuating a lever, it may be presumed to be susceptible of

considerable delicacy, and it would be likely to possess the enormous

advantage of giving an automatic record of its behaviour. On the othet

hand the lever must introduce a very unfavourable element in the friction

between solids.

     M. d'Abbadie's method of obsei-vation by means of the pool of mercury
seems on the whole to be the best which has been employed hitherto.

But it has faults which leave ample fields for the use of other instruments.
The construction of a well of the requisite depth must necessarily be
very expensive, and when the structure is made of a sufficient size to

give the required degi'ee of accuracy, it is difficult to ensure the relative

immobility of the cross wires and the bottom of the well.

Levels are exceedingly good from the point of view of cheapness and

transportability, but the observations must always be open to some

doubt on account of the possibility of the sticking of the bubble from
the effects of capillarity. The justice of this criticism is confirmed by

the fact that M. Plantamour found that two levels only two meters

apart did not give perfectly accordant results. Levels are moreover,

perhaps, scarcely sensitive enough for an examination of the smaller

oscillations of level. Dr. Siemens' form of level possesses ample sen-

sibility, but is probably open to the same objections on the score of

capillarity.

In the case of our own experiments we think that the immersion of the

whole instrument in water from top to bottom has proved an excellent

precaution against the effects of change of temperature, and our experience

leads us to think that much of the agitation of the pendulum in the

earlier set of experiments was due to small variations of temperature

against which we are now guarded.

     The sensitiveness of the instrument leaves nothing to be desired, and
were such a thing as a firna foundation attainable, we could measure the

horizontal component of the lunar attraction to a considerable degree of

accuracy. "We believe that this is the first instrument in which the vis-

cosity of fluids has been used as a means of eliminating the effects of
local tremors. In this respect we have been successful, for we find

that jumping or stamping in the room itself produces no agitation of the

Wependulum, or at least none of which we can feel quite sure.  are

inclined to try the effect of fluids of greater viscosity, such as glycerine,

syrup of sugar, or paraffin oil. But along with such fluids we shall
almost inevitably introduce air-bubbles, which it may be hard to get rid
of. If a fluid of great viscosity were used, we should then only observe

the oscillations of level of periods extending over perhaps a quarter to

half a minute. The oscillations of shorter periods are, however, so
inextricably mixed up with those produced by carriages and railway

trains, that nothing would be lost by this.

     In connection with this point Mr. Christie writes to me, that ' In the

old times of Greenwich Fair, some twenty years ago, when crowds of
people used to run down the hill, I find the observers could not take

reflection observations for two or three hours after the crowd had been

turned out       We do not have anything like such crowds now, even

on Bank holidays, and I have not heard lately of any interference with

the observations.' If the observers attributed the agitation of the mer-

cury to the true cause, the elasticity of the soil must be far more perfect
than is generally supposed. It would be surprising to find a mass of

glass or steel continuing to vibrate for as long as two hours after the

disturbance was removed. May it not be suspected that times of agita-
ON THE MEASUKEMENT OF THE LUNAK DISTURBANCE OF GRAVITY. 125

tion, such as those noted by M. d'Abbadie, happened to coincide on two

or three occasions with Greenwich Fair ?

    As the sensitiveness of our present instrument is very great, although
the sensitising process has never been pushed as far as possible, we think

that it will be advantageous to construct an instrument on half, or even

less than half, the present scale. The heavy weights which we now

have to employ will thus be reduced to one-eighth of the present amount.

The erection of the instrument may thus be made an easy matter, and
an easily portable and inexpensive instrument may be obtained.

     Our present form of instrument has several serious flaws. The image
is continually travelling off the scale, the gearing both internal and ex-

ternal to the room for observing is necessarily complex and troublesome

to erect, and lastly we have not yet succeeded in an accurate determina-

tion of the value of the scale.

   We"We are in hopes of being able to overcome all these objections.

propose to have a fixed light, which may be cast into the room from the

outside. This Avill free us from the obviously objectionable plan of having

a gas-flame in the room, and at the same time will abolish the gearing
Wefor traversing the lamp on the scale.
                                         should then abolish the dis-

turbing pendulum and thus greatly simplify the instrument. The read-

ings would be taken by the elevation or depression of the back-leg, until

the image of the fixed light was brought to the cross wire of the observing

telescope.

    The ease with which the image may be governed with our present

arrangements leads ua to be hopeful of the proposed plan. The use

of the back-leg will, of course, give all the displacements in absolute

measure.

     The only gearings which it will be necessary to bring outside the
room will be those for sensitising and for working the back-leg. The
sensitising gearing when once in order will not have to be touched

again.

     The objections to this plan are, that it is necessary to bring one of the
supports of the instrument under very slight stresses, and that it will not
be possible to take readings at small intervals of time, especially if a more

viscous fluid be used.

Our intention is to proceed with our observations with the present

instrument for some time longer, and to note whether the general

behaviour of the pendulum has any intimate connection with the

Wemeteorological conditions.  intend to observe whether there is a

connection between the degree of agitation of the pendulum and the

occuiTence of magnetic storms. M. ZoUner has thrown out a suggestion

for this sort of observation, but we find no notice of his having acted

on it.'

   We shall also test how far the operation by means of the back-leg

may be made to satisfy our expectations.

   We have no hope of being able to observe the lunar attraction in the

present site of observation, but we think it possible that we may devise

a portable instrument, which shall be amply sensitive enough for such a

purpose, if the bottom of a deep mine should be found to give a suffi-

ciently invariable support for the instrument.

In bringing to a close the series of Reports which it has submitted during

the past series of years since 1874, the Committee has endeavoured to

collect and to compare together the several exact and well-deduced

results from observations arrived at hitherto by various independent

experimenters and investigators in the subject of its inquiry, so as to

show at once the present position of the exjjerimental research and the

most essential points in which it requires further extensions and improve-

ments.  .II,-,.

The method pursued by Professor Everett in his work on ' Units and

Physical Constants,' of expressing all the well-determined data of phy-

sical experiments in terms of the centimetre, the gi'amme, and the second

as a common system of units, is adopted in forming the general list of

absolute and relative thermal conductivities by different observers, which

the Committee has met with and collected together in the simple order

and arrangement of a classified Table of thermal properties of rocks pre-

sented with this Report. Many of the data presented in the Table are

therefore already furnished in the uniform and well-authenticated form

required, in Professor Everett's work. But the result of the present

comparison has afforded the Committee such positive grounds of confi-

dence in the general accuracy of the values found by its long-continued

series of experiments, that it has been enabled by that means to assign

absolute values to the relative ones of several important lists of thermal
ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF CERTAIN ROCKS.                       127

conductivities which, on account of their relative values only, could not
receive admission to the store of absolute data furnished by Professor
Everett's descriptions and reductions. In relation to this procedure the
example of Peclet has been followed in the present list, who, in 1841,
adopting relative numbers found by Despretz in 1821 and 1827, assigned

absolute values to Despretz's series, by means of his own absolute deter-

mination of the thermal conductivity of one of the substances (statuary

marble) examined by Despretz. The values so assigned conjointly by
Peclet and Despretz are marked ' Despretz (a) ' in the Table. But in a
later relative list of Despretz, of a few specimens of rocks tested in 1852

(not used, apparently, by Peclet in his general list of 1853), the value
given for marble, for reduction of Despretz's earlier list, is not adhered
to in the present Table, but the average conductivity found by a number
of experiments of the Committee on different marbles is used instead of

it, and Despretz's relative values thus converted into absolute ones are

marked ' Despretz (/3), 1852,' in the present list.

   A similar course had to be pursued in the case of two important

relative researches published almost simultaneously in 1856 and 1857

by Helmersen of St. Petersburg, and Hopkins of Cambridge, on
thermal rock-conductivities. To the relative quantities given by those

researches for vein-quartz and white statuary marble respectively, the

average values of the absolute conductivities of those rocks found by the

Committee's repeated observations of them, are assigned (with a slight

deviation in the latter case for the reasons recognised below), to convert

the other relative quantities of the two researches into absolute measure,

and to allow of their being compared on a common scale with other absolute

determinations in the general list.

     The work of Helmersen terminated in recording the observed tem-
peratures along bars of the tested specimens one and a-half inch
square and eighteen inches long, heated at one end, according to
Despretz's method. Pour thermometers being distributed at equal
distances along the bars, it was found that in the worst-conducting bars
the logarithmic decrement of temperature was so far from uniform and
constant, that abandoning the doubtful measurement of its true value in
each of them, Helmersen was contented to conclude from his experiments
that vein-quartz was the best conducting material of those which he

examined.
     As, however, unusual care was bestowed on Helmersen's experiments,

the relative quantities which they denote are yet of great value for
corroborative estimations. The decrements for each bar, and for each
interval between the four thermometers, was therefore deduced from

them, and by a mode of reduction to a mean decrement for each bar used
independently of each other by two of the Committee to reduce the

observations with the best presumptive regard to their respective weights,
to relative conductivities, the following two series of numbers were
obtained :

to those near the cool end of the bars, where the stationary temperatures

shown by the thermometers inserted in the bars were, in general, very
little in excess of the temperature of the surrounding air. The numbers

in this series were divided by 0-72 to make that for quartz correspond

to the thermal conductivity 0-0096, found for that substance as the

average result of the Committee's experiments described in former years

in these Reports. The constant rate of logarithmic decrement in the

quartz-bar, in fact, shows that its conductivity was more exactly measured

by that quantity than in the case of the other bars whose rates of

logarithmic decrement were very variable.

The processes of experiment used by Hopkins and by Less to compare

together the thermal conductivities of two considerable series of rocks,

were those of Fourier and of Peclet, with some slight modifications, and

they differ principally from the latter, and from that employed in the

experiments of these Reports, in not affording the absolute, but only

the relative, conductivities of the tested plates. In both mercury was

used to establish direct contact between the plates and the heater and

cooler between which they were interposed ; and the heat traversing the

plate from below in the former, escaped to the surrounding air from the

bright fluid surface of the upper covering of mercury whose temperature,

and that of the mercury below the plate was at the same time observed.

In Less's experiments the heat which passed downwards escaped to the

outer air from a blackened copper plate pressed (like a heated one above)
Aagainst the rock plate with a wet-junction of mercury.
                                                                   thermopile

placed opposite to the radiating-plate enabled its temperature to be

observed.

The numbers (relative ones) 7C3 and 769, found by Less for Italian

and Carrara marbles are higher than the Committee's absolute (signifi-

cant)  numbers  (57  and 61)  of  white  marbles  from  Italy and  Sicily                         the
                                                                                               ;

same being in general the case throughout the two lists. , The numbers

of Less's list have all been diminished by one-tenth to assimilate them
to and incorporate them in the present general list. But no altera-
tion of the significant relative numbers obtained by Hopkins from his

experiments was found to be required, the slightly defective number, 53,

for statuary marble being compensated, especially in some granites and

hard rocks, by a little excess of the relative numbers above those obtained

by the Committee as absolute ones for quartz and granite. Accordingly,

in the general list the relative numbers given by Hopkins have been used

directly in a proper decimal place to give average absolute values of the

conductivities which he found for certain different groups of common

descriptions of rock tested in his experiments.

Other observations, especially those of Peclet and Neumann, are

     originally absolute determinations.

          Of the original memoirs from which these data were extracted, and
    also of a long series of other papers relating to measurements of thermal

    conductivity, which mainly comprise the past history of its experimental
    investigation, a descriptive index and digest was drawn up for the
    Committee by Mr. Dunn. Of this abstract, as it supplies references, and
    further particulars of the experiments which have just been described,

     The appearance, in the first quarter of this century (in the year 1822),
of Fourier's work on the laws of heat-conduction, and later on (in the

year 1835) the production by Poisson of a similar treatise, together with

publications by these and by Rudberg, Quetelet, Kuppffer, and other

wi'iters of distinction on the same subject in the interval between those

dates, directed the attention of those concerned in investigations of terres-

trial physics to a new method of enquiry regarding the debated question

of the globe's internal temperature. Between the upholders of the rival

theories of the earth's original igneous, or aqueous consolidation, the reality

of the argument of the gradual increase of temperature with depth

below the surface of the earth was clearly demonstrated and established

at about that time by the works of Cordier in Prance, and of Fox and
Henwood in England, on the temperature of mines in deep workings at

ma,ny different locahties of the globe. The evidence which this,*now

universally established phenomenon presents in the views of Fourier's

theory of a waste (presumably constant) of the globe's internal heat, has

pointed not only to an extremely high present, but also to a much higher

past internal temperature                                                                                                                 and the verification and extension of Fourier's

theory by legitimate and practicable experimental trials is a course of the

greatest speculative, and, without doubt, also of the greatest practical,

consequence and interest to geologists. It is a meritorious recollection of

its earliest proceedings that, among its first few years' recommendations,

the British Association assisted and substantially endorsed these views by

directing at that time the establishment in Edinburgh, under a Meteoro-

logical Committee, of which Professor Forbes, Professor PhUlips, Colonel

Sykes, Dr. Apjohn, and other distinguished men of science were most

efficient members, of the three series of rock- and earth-thermometers in the

trap-rock of the Calton Hill, the sand of the Botanical Garden, and the

sandstone of Craigleith Quarry, near Edinburgh, which were read and

recorded weekly, and finally reduced to thermal data for the five years

following theii' establishment, from May 1837 to May 1842, by Professor

Forbes.' The two last of these thermometer-sets were then abandoned, but

the weekly readings of that in the Royal Observatory grounds on the

Calton Hill in Edinburgh were continued uninterruptedly, until the recent

destruction of the instruments, for forty years.

     The records of five years during which observations were recorded at
all the three sets of thermometers by Professor Forbes, and of thirteen

following years, were similarly reduced to thermal data, in the year

1860, by Sir W. Thomson f and Professor Everett also calculated from

a seventeen years' period of the same observations a coefficient of con-

ductivity for the Trap of Calton Hill scarcely distingnistable In its value

from that fonnd by Sir W. Thomson.'

     Transforming these determinations to centimetres, grammes, and
seconds from the units of the Paris-foot and year in which they are
expressed, the corresponding values of the absolute thermal coefficients
so obtained for Calton Hill trap-rock are arranged with those obtained
from the Committee's experiments, in the accompanying general list.
Similar values in the same list denote also, in comparison with the Com-
mittee's observations, the absolute conductivities (by unit- weight of water
and by unit- volume of the rocks) found by the two independent methods
for the sandstone of Craigleith quarry and for the sand of the experi-
mental garden, near Edinburgh, where the other thermometers were

planted.

     The dii'ectly measured values are in general, in these cases, in such
very fair agreement with the thermal conductivities found by computa-
tions, that the verifications which they afford of those results are also a
sjabstantial confirmation of the theory upon which they are founded.
Angstrom's reductions of the 10 feet deep Upsala earth-thermometers in
moist clay afford the same conclusion ; and indeed the agreement pre-
sented by the series of Despretz's, Helmersen's, and Neumann's observa-
tions, and especially by Messrs. Ayrton and Perry's experiment on a
sphere of trachyte, made by methods based on Fourier's theoiy, with the
direct results of various forms of Peclet's method used in the other
determinations of the table, plentifully attest and abundantly substantiate
the same physical agreement.

     There are, indeed, as great difficulties in determining thermal
conductivities from earth-thermometer observations, as in successful
applications of the processes of direct experiment. For while in the latter
artificial temperature and heat-supplies are difficult to keep constant and
to measure accurately, in the former case the natural periodical variations
which furnish observational results for computation, are uncertain in
their separate and combined intensities and efi'ects from year to year. It is
only on the average of several years' records that the annual, semi-annual,
and other quicker oscillations of temperature at the earth's surface can be
regarded as sufficiently constant for a single average period to be severally

followed downwards by calculation, as individual heat-waves among the

deep- sunk thermometers. In this case the same rate of decrease per foot

of logarithmic amplitude, and of angular lead of the maximum or minimum

phase of the descending heat-wave, would be found for all the annual, semi-
annual, and other quicker portions of the oscillation at the surface. The
same value of the earth's conductivity, at any place, would be found from
all these periods. But the varying character, at any place, of the yearly
oscillations of temperature at the earth's surface from year to year, pre-
cludes the possibility in general of such perfectly accordant calculations,
for records not extending over more than one or two years. Reductions,

like Sir W. Thomson's and Professor Everett's, for records extending over

periods of seventeen or eighteen years, show very close approximations to
it. But in briefer periods the efiect on range and retardation near the
surface, produced by half-yearly and other faster oscillations. Is not always
found to be compatible with that attributable to the yearly one, from
secular changes of greater period than either being accidentally combined

with them, of which only long-continued observations can by a final
average eliminate the inconstant actions.

     With all the loss of certainty which thence arises, the records of
earth-thermometers for one or two years only have frequently been

reduced, so as to afford approximate coefficients of amplitude-decrease
and retardation, from which corresponding conductivities in terms of the
heat capacity of a unit-volume of the rock- substance, and of the centi-
metre, gramme, and second, as fundamental units, are easily calculated,

when the fundamental units are known in which the concluded coefficients

were expressed. Coefficients of this kind were deduced by Kuppflfer
from Ott's extensive three-year observations at Ziirich about the years
1760-62, and from Dr. Leslie's, at Raith, near Edinburgh, in 1816 and
1817. The equivalents of these coefficients given in the table in the

column of the ratio --, assume the units in which they were originally

                                            c

expressed to have been, the Paris-foot in the former, and the English-
foot in the latter reduction, those having been apparently (in the absence
of other intimations in Kuppffer's work), the scale-units of depth of
the Ziirich and Raith thermometers used and adopted by Kuppffer in
his calculations. The conductivity derived directly from the recorded
loss of range, which was nearly the same in one year as in the other,
between the two deepest (4 feet and 8 feet deep) thermometers at Raith

in 1816 and 1817, differs so much from that belonging to the higher

seated ones (at 1 foot, 2 feet, and 4 feet deep), and from Kuppffer's
mean value of the rate of logarithmic decrement for the whole of the
records at the different depths, that in view of the probability of the
lowest pair of thermometers being least of all affected in their ranges
by temperature-oscillations of short periods at the surface, a separate

--entry is given in the Table of the value of the ratio derived from

                                                                                                                     c

being more certainly dependable than that arrived at from all the ther-
mometer indications together, without any choice or preference.

     Another logarithmic rate instanced by Kuppffer in the same paper as
the last two, is deduced from three' years observations at Strasburg, by
Hemmschneider, in 1821-23, of a thermometer fifteen feet below the sur-
face of the earth. This reduction seems to be as doubtful and uncertain

as that last described, and the equivalent conductivity - is as high

                                                                                                                                              c

(0'01267) as that denoting Kuppffer's mean rate for the Raith thermo-
meters is low (0*00444) among ordinary values. But from Rudberg's

one- to three- feet deep thermometer records in the Observatory plain of
coarse sand at Stockholm, three reductions for one year each, 1832-33,
1833-34, and 1834 alone (the last two by Quetelet and Angstrom) give
conductivity equivalences 0-0060, 0-0071, and 0-0093 very divergent but
generally resembling those found by Forbes and Thomson, -0067, -0079,
and -0087 for Calton Hill trap-rock and garden-sand. The Committee's
experiments gave -0036 for dry, and '0144 for thoroughly water-saturated
fine siliceous sand. But the source of divergence in the appajrent geo-
thermal conductivity at Stockholm was more probably, as Angstrom

recognised, in comparing Quetelet's with his own result, the irregular

course of temperature at the locality in two successive years, than possible
138 REfOST-- 1881.

variations at the place of the soil's dryness or Wetness during the same
time. The high valae of the stratum-conductivity, found by Quetelet, in
two years at Brussels, for earth of the deep-sunk thermometer bed, estab-
lished and observed there in 1834 and 1835 (0-0120), may, perhaps, for
the same reason, be in some measure accidental ; but no errors of the
same kind can be easily supposed to affect the widely different value
(0-0057) which Angstrom's reduction in 1851, of seven years' records of
the deep-sunk thermometers, at Upsala, gave for the uniform bed of
sandy clay in which those thermometers are placed.

     The surface-stratum conductivity given by Poisson's reduction, in his
' Theorie Mathematique de la Chaleur,' of Arago's unpublished e%rth-
thermometer observations in Paris (0-0083), and that assigned by Ang-

strom's discussion of Caldecott's observations for three years of deep-sunk
thermometers in ' laterite,' at Trevandrum (0-0074), are both of average

or ordinary magnitudes. Two values, however, obtained subsequently

by Angstrom, apparently from earth-thermometer records at Upsala,
for wet clay and argillaceous sand (0-0047 and 0*0045), are again re-
jnarkably low quantities compared with the well-established conductivities
in terms of heat-capacity by volume (00205 or 0231) found by Forbes
and Thomson to belong to Craigleith sandstone.

     Of the existence, thei-efore, in different rocks and soils, of great
diversity in their powers of transmitting heat-waves, or periodical and

other fluctuations of temperature, the hitherto conducted observations of
earth-thermometers have given abundant proofs and illustrations. It
redounds, indeed, especially to the well-earned scientific prestige of the
British Association that this result has been arrived at by one of its
earliest initiatives and promotions of scientific objects in no small degree

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

for by its timely establishment and careful choice of the sites of the
Edinburgh rock- and earth-thermometers, a thermal property of the pure
Craigleith coal-measure sandstone has been revealed, to which no other
earth-thermometer records and reductions yet made have hitherto pre-
sented any parallel. The geothermal conductivity of this kind of sand-
stone is nearly twice as great as that of any other earth-stratum hitherto
tested with thermometers, and five or six times as great as that of moist
clay and argillaceous earth tested by the same mode of observation.

    An error of reduction which affected all the Committee's absolute

conductivity-determinations, was noticed after the production in the
volume of these Reports for the year 1878, of the last general table
of the Committee's observations. The necessary correction which it
entailed upon the list was notified in the following report (in the volume
of these Reports for the year 1879), and corrected values of several of
the results before obtained were then communicated. The required

corrections have now been applied to the whole of the measurements
contained in the last general table, and the numerous trials made in

several cases of rocks of the same class and geological description have
been incorporated, owing to the close similarity which in general subsists
between them, into single average results for the several distinct classes
or geological kinds of rock. The comparison which can thus be formed
in the accompanying general list between these measurements and those
obtained by other methods and researches is in general very satisfactory,

and exhibits in many cases corroborations of very excellent accordance.
     The confirmations desired by Poisson of the applications of Fourier's

theory to the problem of heat and temperature- distribution and changes

in the interior of the globe, by instrnmentally measured values of the
thermal coefficients to which they either lead, or which, on the other

hand, they require for their extensions, are now at least partially sup-
plied. But it must be admitted that many imperfections of experimental

methods, as well as intricacies of the theory's applications, still remain to
be removed before the confirmation and assistance which one branch of

the subject of heat-conduction can derive from and may usefully offer to

the other, can yet be satisfactorily affirmed to be complete.

    Upon this point, which embraces the geological aspect and objects of
the present investigation in its widest sense, much more might be written

and comprised in this report which the Committee has noted and col-
lected in its work of original reference and research. But as these notes

and historical reviews would lead to the extension of this report much

beyond its contemplated length, the Committee deems it necessary, in its
concluding report, to confine itself to the results of recent work and pub-
lications which bear most immediately upon the experimental part of
the problem regarding whose progress and recent investigations it has,

during the long period now terminated of its frequent I'eappointment,

chiefly endeavoured to record the nseful acquisitions, and to present to-

gether an outline of the best existing information.

    Appeared at first that there was a sudden fall at the junction when better con-
    ductor was hotter, but none when bad conductor was hotter. This, however,
    found to be due to rate of commimication of heat to thermo-pair, and when

    thermo-pair was immersed in Hg in each bar no difference of temperature was

     found at the junction.

Code. IV. Science subjects preparatory to entering classes in connection

with science schools.

I. Object lessons are attempted in a large number of infant schools,

and in some instances are very effective in developing the perceptive

powers and intelligence of the children but in other cases they are too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

formal, and left too much to the junior teachers. In boys' and girls'

schools they frequently appear upon the time-table, especiall;^ where, as

in the schools of the London Board, they are looked upon as a necessary

part of the instruction : but they are generally given in an unsystematic,

and often in an unsatisfactory manner.

II. The teaching of science as a class subject under the Code only

commenced last October, and thus no examinations have yet been held

under it. Natui'al history, physical geography, natui'al philosophy, &c.,

are mentioned in article 19, c. 1, and it is stated that the instruction
should be given ' through reading lessons, illustrated, if necessary, by

maps, diagrams, specimens, &c. ;' but the teachers are limited to two

subjects, and the old subjects, grammar, history, geography and needle-

work, naturally retain their place in the great majority of the schools.

Suitable reading-books for these rudimentary science subjects have

scarcely yet come into existence.

III. The specific subjects of the fourth schedule include mechanics,

animal physiology, physical geography, botany, and domestic economy,

but only two subjects may be taken (or three if the child has passed

Standard VI.); and the schedule also includes English literature,

mathematics, Latin, French, and German. Literature is a general

favourite ; and domestic economy is obligatory in gii'ls' schools if any

specific subject is taken at all ; so that the chance of any of the others

being introduced is very much diminished. It must also be remembered

that these subjects are only allowed to be taught to children in the fourth

standard and upwards; while only about one-fifth of the children in the

boys' and girls' schools are to be found at present in these standards.

According to the Report of the Committee of Council for Education

recently issued, there were 476,761 children presented for examination in

these standards, of whom the following numbers only were examined in

the science subjects :

Physical geography                                              34,288

Mr. Hance, of the Liverpool School Board, has favoured us with an

account of the systematic scientific instruction which is given in the
Board schools of that town by a special science staff. The subject selected

for the boys is mechanics as defined in the new code, with a considerable

development in the direction of elementary physics. It has been in

following table :

     III. As to specific science suhjects. That a knowledge of the facts of
nature is an essential part of the education of every child, and that it
should be given continuously during the whole of school life from the
baby class to the highest standard. Of course in early years this teaching
will be very rudimentary ; but by developing the child's powers of per-

ception and comparison it will prepare it for a gradual extension of such
knowledge. They consider also that the early teaching must be very

general, while the later may bo more specific ; they think, however, that

the science subjects as given in Schedule IV. are fairly open to objection,
as being somewhat too ambitious in their nomenclature and in their
scope, and that they ought not to bo attempted unless the child has had

a previous training in natural knowledge before entering the fourth

standard. Thus the specific scientific subjects ought not to be distinct, as

they practically ai-e at present, from  the  previous teaching                                                                                 greater lati-
                                                                                                                                            ;

tude   of  choice  might  be  allowed  in  them                            and  while  they should not
                                                                        ;

afford technical instruction they should prepare the way for any technical

classes or schools into which the children may subsequently enter. In

regard to domestic economy they are of opinion that most of the points

embraced in the schedule would be useful to boys as well as to girls.
     IV. As to examinations. That in the appointment of Her Majesty's

Inspectors some knowledge of natural science should be considered as

absolutely requisite ; that in examining the children they should direct

their inquiries so as to elicit not so much their knowledge of special facts

as  their intelligent  acquaintance  with  the  world                      of   nature  around                                                 them
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

and that this may be much better done by oral examination than by paper

work.

--, Fostscnpt. Since this report was in the printer's hands, Mr. Mundella,

the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on PJducation, has laid

upon the table of the House of Commons certain proposals for revision of
the Code. Your Committee is very glad to observe that these proposed

changes are generally in the direction indicated in the above recommen-

dations. Thus, in Infant Schools the full grant will not be paid unless
there be provided ' a systematic course of simple lessons on objects, and

on the phenomena of nature, and of common life ; ' the children in
Standard I. may share in the benefit of elementary science teaching ; and

the instruction of the children in the subsequent standards in scientific

subjects need not necessarily be given ' through reading lessons.' Your
Committee regrets that a stronger inducement has not been held out

to introduce rudimentary science as a class subject ; or rather, that the

prominence given to English grammar and the recitation of poetry will
exclude the new lessons on elementary science from schools where

geography continues to be taken up. It is to be feared, indeed, that if

these proposals should be adopted in their present shape, the children of
Standard IV. will have even less chance of instruction in natural know-
ledge than they have at present, for they will not be allowed to take up

any science as a specific subject, while their taking elementary science as
a class subject will be very problematical. Your Committee, therefore,

while expressing great satisfaction with the general scope of these pro-
posals, would urge that the knowledge of nature be put on an equal
footing in our schools with the analysis of the mother tongue, and that

any two of the proposed three class subjects may be taken.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. C.
    Williamson and Mr. W. H. Baily, appointed for the pur-

     p)ose of investigating the Tertiary Flora of the North of Ireland.

     Draivn up hy'^'iLiAA.u Hellier Baily, F.L.S., F.G.S., M.R.I.A.

{Secretary).

              [Plates I. & II.]

The present Report is an account of the continuation of work conducted
by the Secretary, the results of which have been laid before the British

Association at their last and a previous meeting.
     The still further opening np of the iron ore dejDOsits in the County of

Antrim has enabled us to continue the investigation of the plant-remains
associated with it.

    By the identification of these plant-remains we are enabled to fix the

period at which they lived as being Lower Miocene, and thns to deter-
mine the age of the great flow of basalt which is estimated at fifty miles
long by thirty wide, and consequently to extend over about 1,200
square miles of the north of Ireland, attaining in some places a thickness
of 900 feet. They also afford strong evidence of being contemporaneous

with other volcanic districts, such as those of the island of Mull, on the
west coast of Scotland, and North Greenland, where mid-European
plants, such as these, once flourished.

     Most abundant amongst these plant-remains in the North of Ireland

is the sequoia, a species of cypress allied to the great Wellingtonia

Sequoia sempervirens and S. gigantea of California. The species from

these deposits is closely allied to the fossil Sequoia Langsdoifi, but has
been considered sufficiently distinct to receive the specific designation

of Sequoia Du Noyeri. Another species from the ironstone nodules

found on the shores of Lough Neagh is evidently identical with Sequoia
Couttsice, common at Bovey Tracey, also occurring on the Baltic shores
and at North Greenland.

     Impressions of wliat appear to be the cones of Sequoia and other

fruits are not unfrequent in the sedimentary ochreous deposits of Bally-

palady, and at the same place are masses of wood, evidently coniferous,

which may probably have belonged to the Sequoia.
    Mr. Walter Jamieson, manager of the Eglinton Company of Glasgow's

Mining Works at Glenarm, has kindly furnished us with much valuable

information respecting the Miocene deposit there, which is worked by
that company in connection with the aluminiferous earth or bauxite,
and contains an abundance of plant-remains from which on our various

visits we have obtained many interesting specimens. He estimates these

deposits, nnder the Upper Basalt, at not less than 50 or 60 feet in thick-
ness, and states that at Cullinane, near Glenarm, in the course of the
mining operations carried out under his direction, he had been fortunate
enough to find upwards of twenty specimens of fossilised wood of large
size. One of these deserves special meution, as being the root and about
five to six inches of the erect stem of a tree which was found under about

50 feet of basalt. He describes it as ' having a decidedly charred

appearance, its upper portion being in immediate contact with the basalt,
and the stem and root imbedded, to their full extent, in the aluminous

clay.' On a recent visit to Glenarm, this gentleman exhibited to ns fi-ag-

ments of several of these large trunks of trees which he had collected,
some showing knots. One of these pieces of wood measured in its flat-
             ON THE TERTIARY FLORA OF THE NORTH OF IRELAND.                      153

tened state 20 inches across : its diameter would probably have been
about six feet in an uncompressed state. These large woody trunks were
found lying at various angles in the aluminous earth. The character of

this wood still remains to be determined.
     Branches of a cypress, and pine cones, with grasses and reed-like

plants, are not unfrequent in these deposits.
     Leaves and seeds or fruit of Dicotyledonous trees are most frequent.

We have been enabled to identify several of these with fossil plants

from the island of Mull, GEningen, and North Greenland.

   A list of all the species named and identified to the present time is

appended to this report ; and as there are others we have, for want of
sufficient material, only been able to name generically, it may be thought

desirable to continue this investigation, which has added so largely to our

hitherto meagre Miocene Flora of the British Islands.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone,

   Dr. W, R. E. HoDGKiNSON, Mr. W. Carleton Williams, and

   Dr. P. P. Bedson {Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
   investigating the Method of Determining the Specific Refraction

   of Solids from their Solutions.

The specific refraction of a substance, i.e., the index of refraction, minus
unity divided by tlie density, is, according to Messrs. Gladstone and Dale,

a property uninfluenced by the passage from the solid to the liquid state.
Further, since the specific refraction of a mixture of liquids is the mean

of those of its constituents, it .follows that tlie specific refraction of a

solid may be deduced from that of a solution containing it ; the specific

refraction of the solvent being known. In support of the method of

determining the specific refraction of a solid, based upon these observations,

these authors have advanced some direct proof ('I^hil. Trans.,' 1869,
{)p. 13, 14), and also a large amount of collateral evidence.' The method
has, however, been called in question, more especially by Janovsky

(Sitzungsber. Wien. ' Akademie,' Ixxxii. 1880,148), Avho denies the possi-
bihty of determining the refractive index of a solid from solution Hence it

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ._

was thought desirable to submit the method to further examination, (1) to
test the accuracy of the statement made by this investigator, and (2) to
ascertain how far this method is applicable to determine the specific and

molecular refraction of solid compounds.
     In order to test the method, the specific refraction of liquid phenol has

been determined and compared with that obtained from its solution in
alcohol and glacial acetic acid. Further, the specific refractions of rock
salt, borax, and boric acid in the solid state have been compared with
the values obtained from their aqueous solutions. The instrument used to
detei-mine the refractive indices was a spectrometer obtained from Becker

(Meyerstein's successor) ; its graduated circle is divided into tenths of a

degree, and by means of verniers these divisions are further divided,
so that readings can be made to one second. The refractive indices have
been determined for the hydrogen lines a, ft, and y. in some cases for
the sodium line also ; from these, by the aid of Cauchy's formula, the
index of refraction (A) for a ray of light of infinite wave-length has

been calculated. The refractive indices are deduced from at least four

readings                                                  the  refractive indices,  calculated  in  two  sets of observations
                                                       ;

from such readings, differing from one another in the fifth place of

decimals only.

     In the case of liquids, a hollow prism was used of about 15 ccm.
capacity, closed by two plates of glass, the surfaces of which were
parallel. The prism has an aperture for the insertion of a thermometer,

by means of which the temperature of the liquid under experiment may

be ascertained. The thermometer used was one of Geissler's, graduated

to two-tenths of a degree, and, consequently, readings to one-tenth of a

degree could be made with accuracy. The temperature of the liquid
in the prism was raised to and maintained at the point desired, by means

of the circulation of warm water through a series of glass tubes placed

at the back of the prism and under the table upon which it stood.
     The specific gravities of liquids and solutions were determined in an

                                                               « Dr. Gladstone's article, Phil. Mag., 1881, pp. 64-60.

apparatus similar in form to that used by Sprengel, by means of which
great accuracy can be attained. The specific gravities are given in relation
to water at 4°.

     The specific refractions of the alcohol, glacial acetic acid, and the
distilled water used in the following experiments were determined with
special care, and gave the following results :

gravity afc the same temperature was found to be 1'074'i ; heuce its

Anspecific i-efraction for this ray is -5307.  alcoholic solution, containing

50-6 per cent, of phenyl ether, gave '5265 as the specific refraction for the

same line A.

                   II. EucJc salt in solid state and in aqueous solution.

    Rock salt was chosen for these experiments for the following reasons :--

(1) the fact that it can be obtained in large transparent masses, (2) its
refraction is not influenced by its crystalline form, (3) its easy solubility in
water. For the determination of its refractive index a prism was cut from
a piece of a colourless and clear specimen ; and the prism then ground and

polished. The angle of the prism was determined by aid of the image of
the illuminated slit reflected from the two faces, and the refractive indices
for a, ft, and y determined in the usual manner. The specific gravity of
the prism was determined by weighing it first in air, and then in pure

benzene. In the preparation of the aqueous solutions, jjortions of the

rock salt from which the prism had been cut were used. The following
table contains the numbers obtained, and the specific refractions of salt for

A:--

       V. Fused sodium vietajihosjohato in the solid state and in solution.

     The attempts made to determine the specific refraction of solid sodium
metaphosphate, by a method similar to that adopted in the case of borax
and boric acid, were frustrated by the hygroscopic nature of this
substance, which rendered it impossible to polish the prisms, which were

cast as before. Nevertheless, a close approximation to its refractive
index, for a ray of light of infinite wave-length, lias been attained, by a

method which, by a more careful application, will probably yield exact
results. This method consists in making a mixture of two liquids, one
more and the other less refractive than the solid, until there is no
apparent difference between the refraction of the solid and liquid. The
refractive index of the liquid is then determined for a, ft, and y, and the

refractive index (A), for a ray of light of infinite wave-length, calculated

from these.
     Such a mixture of aniline and amyl alcohol gave 1'47518 for A, and

one of bromobenzene and amyl alcohol gave 1-45747 for A. The specific
gravity of sodium metaphosphate (fused) was found to be 2-503. Hence
its specific refraction is -1898, calculated from the first value of A, and
·1827 from the second. The mean of these values, viz., -1862, differs by
·0023 from the mean of the specific refractions deduced from its aqueous

solution.

     The following table contains the results obtained from aqueous
solutions of sodium metaphosphate of different strengths:

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William
    Thomson, Dr. J. Merrifield, Professor Osborne Keynolds,
    Captain Douglas GtAlton, Mr. J. N. Siioolkred {Secri'tary), Mr.
    J. F. Deacon, a>id Mr. Eogers Field, appointed for the pitrpjose
    of obtaining information respjecting the Phenomena of the
    Stationary Tides in the English Channel and in the North Sea
    and of repjresenting to the Government of Portugal and the
    Governor of Madeira that, in the opinion of the British Associa-
    tion, Tidal Observations at Madeira or other islands in the North
    Atlantic Ocean ^voidd be very valuable, with a view to the ad~
    vancement of our knotvledge of the Tides in the Atlantic Ocean.

YouK Committee consider that the special ^yorks for which they were

 appointed have been carried out.
      In this, their final report, they beg to mention that the pamphlet-notice

of the tidal observations, named in last year's Report as having been pre-
pared for those Continental observers who rendered valuable assistance
to the Committee in obtaining a portion of the observations, has been

 circulated.

      It appears to be considered to contain valuable information, and as

forming the basis, or starting point for common action in the future
when the subject of the phenomena of these stationary tides receives the
attention it deserves, and whenever it may appear desirable to study the

entire question in a close and thorough manner.

     No ofl&cial reply has been received by the Committee (indeed it was

hardly to bo exjaected) in answer to the inquiries made by it respecting an
international datum for tidal observations, and as to future concerted
action amongst the various maritime Governments respecting a more

extended series of tidal observations.

     Nevertheless, the advantage of a common international datum, which

has for some time been desired, seems to be acknowledged ; and though
the datum suggested by the Committee has in no way been recognised as
such, yet no objections of any moment have been raised against it ; wliile

considerable value seems to be attached to it, as having at least done much

to advance the desired object, if not to offer the actual solution which is

most desirable.

   --With regard to the second object of the Committee : to urge tho

desirability of the Azores Islands as a station, where a series of valuable
observations might be carried out upon the tides of the North Atlantic
Ocean, it has already been stated that the Portuguese Government
readily took up the idea, and had established a self- registering tide-gauge
in the Bay of Funchal.

     Another incidental duty which fell to the lot of the Committee was to
urge upon the Board of Trade the importance of a self-registering tide-
gauge at Dover.

     That department of the Government, as already reported, set up at its

own expense the desired instrument, which is working regularly and

giving satisfaction ; so that, before long, a series of permanent records

may be expected from this most important station, which will serve aa
data for future observations, when required.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor P. M.
   Duncan, F.R.S., and Mr. Gr. K. Vine, appointed for the purpose

   of reporting on Fossil Polyzoa. Drawn up by Mr. Vine

    (Secretary).

After many laborious researches, Naturalists, generally, have accepted
Dr. AUman's Gymnol5;mata, for one at least of the orders of the Class

MPolyzoa. In this order the ' Polypide is destitute of an epistomc (foot) : ';u«^/t

and the lophophore is circular.'^ The order is divided into three sub- fi^/tt^i,

orders :                        = Oelleporina, Ehrenberg.
                                = TuhuUporina, Milne-Ed., Hagenow,
     I. GheUostomata, Busk.
                                  Ir            ·                     Johnston.
    II. Gyclostomata, ,,
                                                  f
  III. Ctenostomata, ,,
                                n. i cry--rP^'-'L^t^ ^

     The whole were ' founded by Professor Busk on certain structural
peculiarities of the cell.''^ Only species belonging to two of these sub-

orders are found fossil, and to these alone I shall direct attention.

  --I. Cheilostomata. Polyzoa belonging to this sub-order are ' distin-

guished by the presence of a movhible opercular valve.' ^ This, however,

is  not  a character  on  which   the Paiasontologist      can  rely  for  evidence
                                                                                                                     ;

but there are others. The ova are usually matured in external ' mar-

supia,' or ova-cells ; there are also appendicular organs avicularia and

vibricula ; and later investigations have proved the existence of peculiar
perforations in the cell- walls, which Eeichert called 'Rosettenplatten,' and

Hincks ' communication-pores.' Through these openings the ' endo-

sarcal ' cord of Joliet,^ in the living Polyzoa, passed from cell to cell.

The aperture, or mouth of the cell, though variously shaped, is always

sub-terminal. To prove that Polyzoa (judging from the calcareous

remains) of this sub-order were present in the Paleozoic seas, it is

necessary that some one or other of the above-named characters should

--be present in the species introduced as Cheilostomatous.
     II. Cyclostomata. The simplicity of structure in this sub- order

precludes elaborate description. There are, however, a few points of

special structure to which it may be as well to direct attention. The cells

are invariably tubular, or nearly so ; the mouths are circular, and,
generally speaking, of the same diameter as the cell. The cell-mouths
in many of the Cyclostomata are covered by calcareous opercula, in both

--recent and fossil species, and these are considered to be by Mr. P. D.
--Longe * of an analogous character with the corneous opercula of the
--Cheilostomata. Be this as it may all the Cyclostomatous opercula are
--calcareous and their use has not yet been definitely made out.

      In his classification of the British Marine Polyzoa, Mr. Hincks bases his

--genera and species, to a large extent, upon the shape and character of the

cell and ceU-mouth, the habit of species is only of secondary importance.

 divisions are of supreme importance, and the Palaeontologist may do well
 to carry over the leading idea of Smitt and Hincks when working out
 fossil species, especially so when dealing with Palaeozoic types. It may

 be well, too, to caution the student in his use of the generic names of the
 earlier authors. These have to be revised according to modern usage. In
 every case where I could retain the original designation of the author of

 genera and species I have done so, but it seems to me to be folly to

 perpetuate a nomenclature which does not indicate generic affinity. In his
 otherwise carefully written 'Introduction,' Mr. Hincks says, 'There is
 evidence, however (as I learn on the excellent authority of Mr. R.
 Etheridge, Jun.), of the existence of a few Cheilostomatous genera at
 least within this epoch (Palaeozoic), and probably the group is represented

--in the Silurian division of it ' ' a conclusion, which after the most

 careful research, I am unable to agree with.
     In this, as in my former Report, I shall revise the whole of the genera

 and species that have been introduced since the time of Goldfuss into the
 nomenclature of Silurian and Devonian literature. I would prefer to

deal only with British species, but as many papers describing new genera

 and species, from foreign sources, have been published in this country, I
 cannot do otherwise than review, if not revise, these as well. But

whereas, in my former Report I dealt generally with material in my own

 cabinet, in this I shall refer largely to the Polyzoa in the magnificent

 collection of the School of Mines, Jermyn Street. For this purpose I have
 handled, and noted down particulars of every specimen in the collection,
 from the Lower Silurian to the Devonian. This I have been enabled to
 do through the kindness of Mr. Etheridge, F.R.S., and Mr. E. T. Newton,

 Assistant Naturalist of the School of Mines.

      Professor Duncan has expressed a wish that in this Report I should
 draw up a suggestive Terminology, that would be in keeping with modern

 usage and applicable to Palasozoic species. In accordance with the spirit

of this request the following terms may be accepted generally. In it I
have followed the leading of Busk and Hincks, without wholly neglecting

     This species of Hall's has been reworked from fresh material, by
Nicholson. The slight figures given by him show a habit nearly akin to
Kippotlioa alstersa, Busk, fig. 6, pi. 22, Busk's ' Crag Polyzoa,' only rather
more swollen at the distal part of the cell. In the cell-mouth of Busk's
figure the peristome is sinuated : in Nicholson's figure it is circular. There
is also a resemblance to Goldfuss' Aulopora dichotoma, Tab. 65, Fig. 2. I
know of no species of HipjDothoa, recent or fossil, with which it can be
otherwise favourably compared. Generically it has no affinity with the

HippOTHOlD^ of Busk, and without doing violence to the generic character
of Hippothoa as given by Hincks,' it cannot be placed with the genus.
The species, Nicholson says, is abundant in the Cincinnati Group of the
Hudson River formation, near Cincinnati, Ohio.

                                   Genus Betepora, Imperato.

     Ever since this genus was introduced in 1559, it has been used by
authors indiscriminately for all manner of fenestrated polyzoa. Lamarck,

in 1815, fixed the type of Linnaeus, Millepora cellulosa, calling it E. cellulosa,

and since then, the name Betepora has been used for a genus of tbe
EsCHARiD^. None of the so-called Retepora of the Pateozoic era haAc
any affinity with this family, or even with the genus as now itndevstood.
The word should be entirely abandoned for every species of Palivozoir

Polyzoa.

pai't, is the Microporella of Hincks, a geuus wliicli includes species
selected from no fewer than ten genera of recent and fossil Polyzoa.

      Laying aside the genus Ptilodictya, I have no knowledge of any other
Palseozoic Polyzoa that can be, even provisionally, placed with the Cheilo-

stomata. After careful consideration I am reluctantly obliged to say that

at present there is no evidence that the sub-order existed in any of the

Palaeozoic seas, and further, the evidence is very doubtful until we reach

the Mesozoic era. Notwithstanding this decision I shall be amongst the
first to acknowledge the ea,rlier existence of types if well-defined evidence
is brought to bear in the diagnosis of new discoveries.

      Taking into consideration the shape and character of the cell as pre-
senting, apparently, an Eschuridie type, I think I cannot do better than

begin this Report with a revision of the whole of the PtUodicfya. M'Coy '

places this genus as the fourth in his Family Escliaridm ; Berenicea being

the third genus in the family. From the characters given, ' cells shal-

low, oblong, or ovate, often provided with an operculum, capable of being

closed by special musdeti,' M'Coy evidently believed that the Palteo-

zoic species could be naturally placed in this Family. The true EsCHA-
RiD^ are of later date, probably not older than the Lower Oolite, and
then not as a typical, but only as a kind of passage group. Leaving the
classification as an open question at present, I shall take Lonsdale's defi-
nition for the group as redescribed by M'Coy :

This genus is very fairly represented by specimens in the School of

Mines. There are no fewer than ten species named, and three marked

' New Sp.' awaiting description. Accepting the w-ork of other authors,

I can do no more than furnish notes on them, just as they are named.

The first specimen is P. dichotoma, Portlock, in the Wyatt-Edgell Col.,

and is found in the Lower Llandeilo flags, and the species ranges into

the Upper Llandeilo and Caradoc. In the Caradoc, also, we have the

P. acuta, Hal], which, if correctly identified, is very widely distributed in

the American and English Silurians of the same horizon ; and P. explanafa,
M'Coy. Three species undescribed, but bearing MS. names by Mr.

Etheridge : P. papilMa, P. ramosa, F. scutata. In the Lower Llandovery
we have the P. fucoides, M'Coy, a species having a very limited range.

.In the Upper Llandovery we have P. lanceolata, Lonsd., which ranges

through the Wenlock Shale, Wenlock Limestone, Lower Ludlow and

Aymestry Limestone. There is a departure from the type in P. scalpellum

(Eschara? scalpedhim, Lonsd.); it is marked as appearing in the Upper

Llandovery and "Wenlock Limestone. Hall, in the first vol. of the 'Pal.,'

New York, figures and describes P. (Stictopora) acuta, which he compares

with this species of Lonsdale. In this species, too, there seems to be no

central laminar axis. It is found in the Trenton Limestone. With regard

to Fiilodidya lanceolata, Lousd., and P. Uimeolata, Goldfuss, there seems

to be a little confusion iu our varied identifications of species. lu the

Catalogue of Cambrian and Silurian Fossils,' all the P. lanceolata found
in the Upper Llandovery to the Upper Ludlow series, with the exception of
one species found in the 'Weulock Limestone, are ascribed to Lonsdale. The

Wenlock species is identified as that of P. lanceolata, Goldfuss. This con-
fusion is to be regretted, and in justifying the course taken by Mr. E. T.
Newton in the Catalogue, I would suggest that the Wenlock shale species

--receive a new name P. Lonsclalia. There are many characters in this

species distinct from the species described by Goldfuss as Flustra lanceo-

lata.   There  is  also  a  pressing necessity that  the types of     Ptilodictya

       .

should become fixed, either as a genus or as a family.

     Ptilodictya scalpellum is a type somewhat diiferent from that of other

-- --species, and under a family name PTiLODiCTiDiE I should reconsider

my own reference to this genus of the carboniferous Sidcoretepora.-

    Professor Nicholson^ has added much to our knowledge of this group,

by the publication in this country of his papers on American forms. He

has also founded two new genera to take in what he considers to be allied

types. The Upper Sil. species, which are new, are: 1. P.falcifonnis, Nich.f

allied to Uscharopora recta, Hall. His species, however, differs from

Mustra {Ptilodictya) lanceolata, Goldf. P. gladiola &ndi P. sulcata, BiWingfi,

2. P. emacerata, Nich., a beautifully delicate species, with ' elliptical cells,

their long axes corresponding with that of the branches, six or seven in

the space of one line measured longitudinally.' ' This Nicholson con-

siders to closely resemble P. fracjilis, Billings, and it is possible that it

may be only a variety of Billings' species.' * 3. P. flagellimi, Nich.

This also resembles P. gladiola, Billings, and it also very closely re-

sembles the P. Lonsdalia of our own Wenlock shale, excepting that
the ' attenuated base ' of our own species is rarely ' flexuous,' but more

often truncated and round. 4. P. fenestelliformis,^ Nich. : All these

species are typical, having the non-poriferous margins and the central

--laminar axis. One species Ptilodictya ? arctiopora, Nich. has affinities

with P. raripora. Hall ; but Nicholson doubts the possibility of keeping
these two species with the genvis. The cells closely rese_mble_ some of

the characters of our own Silurian species, but as there is evidently a

departure from the original types, it maybe as well to study these passage

forms, if such they be, more carefully than they have yet been done. 5.

P. cosciniformis,^ Nich. : Hamilton formation, Bosanquet, Ontario.

    For species allied to Ptilodictya, Nicholson has founded two new genera,

and adopted one from Hall.

   In Tceniopora we have a zoarium that is a flattened, linear, calcareous

expansion, with cells on both sides, the branches of which are dichotomous.
There is a median ridge on each face of the zoarium having a longitudinal
direction, on the lateral halves of vvhich the cells are developed. These
are longitudinally placed in rows of from three to five. The margins are

usually plain and non-celluliferous. Two species are described : T. exiguUf

Nich., and T. penniformis, Nich., both from the Hamilton group.

In Clathropora the zoarium is a kind of membranous flattened ex-

pansion, with rounded or oval fenestras of considerable size. The cells are

on both sides, separated by a thin laminar axis. The fenestrae are

--surrounded by a striped non-celluliferous margin. One species is de-

scribed G. ititertexta, Nich. from the Corniferous Limestone, but in

some respects it resembles P. coseiniformis, Nich., of which mention ha.s

already been made.

In Heterodicta the zoarium forms a simple, flattened, unbranched, two-

edged frond, with sub-parallel sides. The cells are in two series ; the

central cells are perpendicular to the base, the lateral cells are oblique.

--' In the only species known H. gigantea, Nich. the cells of a few of the

median rows of the frond arc straight .... and, as I am only ac-

quainted with an exceedingly large species, I should, however, suspect

that Flnstra (JPtilodidya) lanceolata, Goldf., will very probably turn out

to be an example of this genus.'

accessible. Many of the Bala series are beautiful casts only, and the Upper

think it very unwise to disturb the present nomenclature without suffi-

cient reason. 2 The MS. names of Mr. Robert Etheridge require con-

firmation, and the best way to do this would be to describe and figure
them. The new genera of Professor Nicholson may in the future em-

brace some few of the forms already described, but we can hardly super-

sede the clear definitions of Lonsdale's types as given by M'Coy. In the

Lower Ludlow rocks specimens of P. lanceolata, Goldf., often break up,

-- --showing the concentrically wrinkled central axis. In the Girvan District
   Scotland at least two distinct species of this genus may be found

P. costellata, M'Coy, and P. dichotoma, Portl.

                1844. MTEIAPORID.S!, M'Coy. Family name only.

     This is the third family of M'Coy's very restricted classification of

=Palaeozoic Polyzoa. It embraces the Retepora, Lamk. to Elasmopora,

King. The family includes Glauconome, Goldfuss, restricted by Lons-
dale, and the genus Fenestella, Lonsdale. It is impossible to retain the
family name in the present Report.

                    1849. Phyllopora, King.

There are unquestionably present in both the American and British

Paleozoic rocks, species of Polyzoa having some of the inosculating

characters of Betepora cellulosa. These can neither be referred to

MyFenestella nor Polypora.  objections to the term Retepora for these

have already been expressed. King, also, in his Permian Fossils, has ex-

pressed his dislike to this term, and he suggests another word to be used

--instead Phyllopora. I prefer this, especially as it has been consecrated
--by two good workers Salter and De Koninck. The earliest appear-

ance of the genus, so far as I am acquainted, is in the Lower Llandeilo^

     ' Geological Mag. 1875.

     2 Since writing the above I have been able to study, very carefullj-, the leading
types of Palfeozoic Ptilodictya. In a future paper on the Family Ptilodictid.iE I

shall be able to correct many inaccuracies of our ordinary nomenclature.

the Devonian series there is a matrix of a very fine species. If better

fragments could be found in the Devonian rocks, good facilities for the

closer study of this type of Palajozoic Polyzoa would be offered.

Indian Fossils of Dr. Fleming. In the monograph of Permian Fossils

Mr. King refers, and fully describes, P. Ehreiibergi, Geinitz, as belonging
to this genus. In his paper on the Permian rocks of South Yorkshire,^
Mr. Kirkby refers fragments of the same species to Ret&pora Ehrenhergi
(Phyllopora). The genus is a comparatively rare one, and well-authenti-

--cated specimens are also rare. To this genus I refer Nicholson's species^
    Plujllopora (Retepora) Trentonensis. It is well described, seeing that his

specimens were mere fragments. Salter has already referred to this

-- --genus M'Coy's Retepora (Phyllopora) Hisengeri in his catalogue of

Silurian Fossils.

                                                                                                            1821 ? Bereiiicea, Lamaroux.

     This genus for the present I have allowed to remain with the family

--Diastoportdce^ not as Diastopora, but as provisional. So far as the

Palaeozoic species are characteristic of the genus we may take M'Coy's
description.^ He says, 'the cells resemble Cellepora, but are not piled,'

but with more justness, ' They also resemble the cells of Stictopora
(Ptilodictya), but are parasitic and confined to one side. They differ from
Discopora by each cell being separated by a small space from its neigh-
bour.' Bereiiicea irregnlarls, Lonsdale (Silurian Sys.), and B. heterogyra,
M'Coy, are distinct types. The Discopora favosa, Lonsd., Wenlock Lime-

stone, approach nearer to the Geramopora type of Hall and Nicholson.^

                                        1828. Discopora, Flem. ?

    Two types of this genus, as understood by Lonsdale, are found in the

Wenlock series of Fossils at the School of Mines. One, D. favosa,

Lonsd., is a beautiful little dome-like species with cells very regularly

disposed radiating from the centre. The other is much larger and marked

Discopora favosa ? Lonsd. Both are good types, and they will ultimately
find their proper place in our classification. But as Discopora {Patindla

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1

168 REPOBT-- 1881.

Shrnbsole's work I am inclined, generally, to agree. He may be blamed for

the limitation of species, but the fault lies not with him, but with authors

who have introduced into our scientific literature specific names for frag-

ments that were really portions only of other species. This has already

been pointed out, but much yet remains to be done before the family can
be considered to be completely revised. It may then be necessary to
reintroduce one or two species which are now regarded as synonyms, and
also to establish two or three new ones. For the present I can do no

other than report on the literature and species which have not yet found
a place in the revisions of Mr. Shrubsole.

Gorgonia assimilis, Lousd., Murch Sil.
Fenestella ,, Cat. Cambrian and Sil. Fos. School of Mines.

This species has been alluded to in Mr. Shrubsole's second paper

(p. 247). In the above catalogue it may be found among the Caradoc
and Wenlock Limestone series of Polyzoa. This species has not been

described, and there seems to be a doubt whether it should be referred to

Fenestella or Retepora (Phyllopora).*

  -- --Many of the earlier specimens Caradoc and Up. Llandovery are

very indistinct, and complete identification seems to be impossible. The

type is a peculiar one, but after going over the specimens I can make out

the following characters. The zoarium is irregular and dichotomously

branching, no regular dissepiments or fenestra). The frequent bifurca-

tions of the branches, by infringing upon the lower branches, are the

only means by which fenestree are formed                                                                                                                                                                                       the number of pores on either
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

side of these vary fi-om ten to thirteen. I cannot therefore suppose that

these earlier Fenestella assimilis of the Catalogue are in any way related to

Fenestella reteporata, Shi'ubsole, of the Wenlock Limestone, So far as I

am able to judge from the specimens, tliey are totally distinct.

The whole of the type specimens of Upper Silurian Fenestella, Mr.

Shrubsole has gone over carefully ; but as many of these were mere frag-
ments of the reverse, showing no cell-arrangement, he found them alto-

gether valueless for accurate definition. In consequence of this revision the

whole of the Upper Sil, Fenestellid^ i«i^put down by him as follows :

All these species are found in the Wenlock Limestone, Dudley, and two

-- --of them if not three in the Niagara Limest., Lockport, America.

Of the Devonian Fenestella but few species are recorded. But as

Professor Nicholson has published his papers in this country, we are

largely indebted to him for what little is known, besides those that are

figured and described by Goldfuss and Phillips.

Many, if not all, of these species are founded upon fragments, or on the

reverse only of specimens ; and according to the laxness or rigidness with
which they are examined, their value in a scientific criticism is of variable
importance. They are nevertheless links in the chain of evidence, and

until they are displaced by better specimens, which, of course, will allow

of better work, they should find a place in this Report. Nicholson, with

others, uses the term Retepora very indifferently. Speaking of i?.
Phillipsi, he says, ' This is a genuine Betepora, and in its general form and

its biserial cells is closely allied to R. prisca, Gold., which I have found

abundantly in the Corniferous Limestone of Ontario.' As I have already

placed Goldfuss's B. prisca with the Fenestellid^, I cannot do otherwise

with this one.

In addition to this species Nicholson founded two new genera for

Devonian Fenestella :

         1874. Gryptopora, 'An. Mag. Nat. Hist.' Feb. 1874.

                ,, Carinopora ,, ,, ,, ,,             ,,
--Two species Gryptopora mirahilis, Nich., and Garinopora Hindei

Nicholson places to these new genera. With all due respect for Professor

Nicholson and his work, I must take his admission that these are

apparently Fenestellidce, and as such there was, I am inclined to think, no

need for founding new genera for their reception. The author refers to

Hemitrypa, and, in one sense, compares his genera with the genus of

M'Coy. Unfortunately for the fate of all three genera, we have only

true Fenestella encrusted by a coral, and the diagnosis of the species
given by both authors is encumbered with partly coraline and partly

polyzoal structures. All the illustrations which Professor Nicholson gives

are structures found in typical Fenestella,' with the exception of Fig. 2 g,
p. 81. Here the 'carina,' or keels, are apparently united by 'stolons,'

which may b6 sections of the tabulte only of the encrusting coral. Fig.

/ is without this ' stoloniferous ' connection, but both are sections of

branches cut through perpendicular to the surface, and showing the

largely developed keel, with the transverse section of the cells. Fig. i is

one of these, isolated. It would be better to view the structures reversed.

Figs, d and e are evidently ordinary Fenestella, and the sections above

described are portions of the same frond.^ The development of the keel

is remarkable, and speaking of G. Hindei Nicholson says, ' The thickness

of the frond, measured at right angles to its plane of growth, is one line

or a little more, nearly two-thirds of this being accounted for by the great

internal keels.' This is equalled by the species F. Lyelli, Dawson, which
is figured and partly described in ' Acadian Geology.' ^

     I arrange these genera and species, not because they are allies, but

because they are the reverse of that. The genera are as distinct as

genera can be, yet they have been confounded by authors. The 0.

disticha of Goldfuss is, I think, distinctly an Upper Silurian type. The Bala

type of Glauconome is a different genus ; and Bamipora, as described by

Toula, has five or six rows of irregular pores. The genus Ramijpora

is a Permo- Carboniferous type, and although having some facial resem-

blance to the species from the Bala beds, and figured as Bamipora, var.

carinata, Bth. Jun.', by Mr. Robert Etheridge, Jun., the two forms differ

in many respects considerably. Bamipora is much larger naturally than

the  Bala  Olauconome                                                       the  cells  are  differently arranged.  In the Lower
                                                                         ;

Silurian species, both the primary and the secondary branches bear two

rows of alternately arranged cells. Having handled and carefully examined

the specimen in the School of Mines, figured by Mr. R. Etheridge, jun.,

Bamipora Hochstetteri, var. carinata, 'Eth., I can bear willing testimony to

the faithful delineation of this beautiful type.

     There are several specimens of this as yet undescribed genus in the

collection already named, and their study will afford a good general idea

of the varying habit of the species.

                                      1844. Polypora, M'Coy.

     Zoarium a delicate, reticulated, calcareous expansion. Branches round,

--from three to five rows of cell-openings margins usually not projecting,

branches connected (occasionally) by thin dissepiments.
     This genus is represented by only one species, P. crassa, Lons., in the

Wenlock Limestone, Dudley. The genus was more fully represented in

-- --America in the Devonian strata, in our own country in the Arctic

--regions and India during the Carboniferous epoch. Professor Nicholson ^

describes and figures three species : P. pidcliella, Nich., P. tenella, Nich.,

P. tuberculata, Nich. As a P. tuberculata has been previously described
byProut^ the name of Nicholson is rather unfortunate, as there is a
difference in the two species, for Nicholson says his is allied to P. verucosa,
M'Coy, and as such it differs fi'om Prout's P. tuberculata, if the identifica-
tions of the Messrs. Young be correct. P. pidcJiella and P. tenella are
nearly allied to P. Malliana, Prout, which occurs ' in the St. Louis
Group of Illinois, and which I have likewise detected in the Corniferous

--formation of Ontario.' Nicholson.

     I have now gone over all the genera wherein the cell-characters are

either ovate or sub-tubular, without saying arbitrarily that these genera
and species belong to the Ctclostomata. I have begun with the species
having the nearest apparent afiBnities with the Cheilostomata, and then
allowed the others to fall in, in a consecutive order. This temporary
arrangement will be better for the present, and this will allow time for a

proper classification when the whole of the Pateozoic Polyzoa have been
more closely studied. The following genera I have not the least hesita-

tion in placing with the Cyclostomata as at present understood.

                                                                            1859. Cyclostomata, Busk.

branches linear or ligulate ; cells disposed in a simple series or in more or

less regular transverse rows of from two to four.'

   A few types of this genus are present in the Palaeozoic rocks of this

-- --country in the Devonian of Bifel and in America.

NewJames Hall, in his ' Pal.' of  York, vol. i., records the existence of

Alecto inflata in the Trenton Limestone. This is a very simple serial

species of a most remarkable type. From the same stratum lie records

another species, Aulopora araclmoidea, altogether different from the first

type. Except that Hall calls these species ' corals,' there are not in his

descriptions any characters that would prevent them being properly

placed with the Polyzoa. I have already alluded to this species, A. inflata,

Hall, when writing of Hippothoa. I now restore it to its proper place.

     These seem to be true Stomatopora (Alecto of Busk), and their exist-
ence is recorded by Nicholson as appearing in the Lower Silurian or
Hudson River Group. One species, A. auloporides, as a branching form,
survives into the Niagara Limestone. In the Caradoc series of Fossils in
the School of Mines, a small specimen of Polyzoa is marked Heteropora,

allied to H. crassa.^ This is a very peculiar species, but in no way related
to Heteropora as now understood. The cells are short and tubular,

alternately placed on the sides of the branch, very similar to the figure given
by Nicholson. Having carefully examined the specimen, I therefore

--temporarily place it as a variety, at least, of Stomatopora aulopondes,

Nich.

     I have, since the above was written, discovered no less than three
distinct STpecies ot Stomatopora in the Upper Silurian Shales of Shropshire.
One I have figured and described S. dissimilis, Vine."* Of the others I have
not yet sufficient details to allow of description. I have also discovered
two species of Ascodictyon,^ full details of which will be published. In

-- --King's Monograph of Permian Fossils, pi. 3, fig. 13, a figure is given of
   apparently a badly preserved specimen of Stomatopora. It very much
resembles the species of Hall, but no cell-mouths are given. King names

it Aulopora [Stomatopora') Voigtiana, King.

                     1839. Diastopora (Atdopora) cotisimilis, Lonsd.

   A species of Polyzoa, named as above, is in the Ketley Collection at

the School of Mines. It is found in the Wenlock Limestone series, but
no locality is given. This is the Aulopora consimilis Lonsd. of the Silurian

System, pi. 15, fig. 7. I have found fragments in the washings of
Mr. Maw.^ Another specimen of the same species, from the Wenlock

Mr. Longe, of Cheltenham. In the Devonian collection of Poly zoa, at the
School of Mines, a species marked Berenicea M'Goyii, Salter, Middle
Devonian, Padstow, bears a very close resemblance to this Silurian type.
Unfortunately the Devonian specimen is very poorly preserved, but I

can trace in the zoarium a svifficient number of cells to afford me some

idea of the general character. The specimen in Mr. Longe's cabinet I
have carefully studied, and I now give a description with very accurate

measurements.
     Zoaria encrusting by a single layer a fragment of coral. Zomcia

tubular, rather regular, in series. As sevei'al colonies are found upon the
same coral, a remarkably irregular character is given to the associated

'Maria. For the j^urpose of this diagnosis I isolate a single colony. Cell-
mouths circular, with a well- formed peristome, and slightly less than the
diameter of the tubes. Six zooecia occupy the space of a line measured
across the mouths of the cells, and two and half, to three, lengthwise in
the same space.'

     The habit of Lonsdale's species in the School of Mines, and also
Salter's Devonian Berenicea, is that of the ordinary Diastopora. The
habit of the species here described, and also the measurements, correspond

--with Nicholson's Alecto confusa. If these be true Diastopora for I

--cannot ignore the existence of D. consimilis and Berenicea APGoyii we

have a true tubular Diastopora carried backward in time to the Wenlock
Limestone consequently the Berenicea which I left provisionally with

                                                         ;

the Diastoporidce^^ will be displaced by undoubted tubular species. The
measurement of Alecto confusa, Nich., is five cells to the line, measured

across the mouth.^ This is slightly less than my own, and may be

accounted for by the more compact arrangement of the cells in the Dudley

specimen.

                                         1826. Geriopora, Goldfuss.

and Nicholson in his New Devonian Fossils adds Ger'iopova ? Samiltonensis,

of which he says, ' This beautiful little fossil (about five cells occupy the

space of a line vertically) occurs in great abundance in some of the beds

of the Hamilton Formation. It is allied to G. ijunctata. Gold., and

Millepora interporosa, Phill. (' Geo. of Tork.') I am at present un-

able to decide as to its true generic affinities, and have simply referred it

provisionally to Ceriopora.' I will also leave it and the other species

alone for the present. The whole of the Gerioporidce will have to be re-

vised, and species from the Silurian to the Crag will have to be re-worked.

                                    1821. Spiropora, Lamx.

    In some of the shale- washings supplied to me by Mr. Maw from strata

read by him on Biastopora, at the Geological Society, May, 1881. I have no desire to

to the examination of Lonsdale's and M'Coy's Silurian and Devonian species in the

                        1874. Botnjllopora, Nicholson.^

This curious genus, founded by N'icholson for Devonian species, is

allied to Defrancia and Lichenopora, but unlike either. The author says

' I have been unable to refer these singular Polyzoa to any existing group,

and have therefore been compelled to found a new genus for their recep-

tion. Zoarium calcareous, sessile, and encrusting, forming systems of
small circular discs, the upper surfaces of which ai^e marked with radiat-
ino- ridges, upon which the cells are carried. Each disc is attached by its

entire lower surface, slightly convex above, with a central nonporiferous
-space, round which a number of radiating poriferous ridgep occupy an

exterior, slightly elevated zone. Cells forming a double series on each
-ridge, immersed with rounded mouths,, which. are not elevated in any

part of their circumference above the general surface.' ^

     One species is given, B. socialis, Nich. PI. ix. fig. 10, and it is not of
very rare occurrence in the Hamilton Formation. I have not seen among

any of our own Palceozoic Polyzoa any approach to this genus. It may

be well to direct attention to the characters, because workers may find

even this amongst the group of our hitherto most neglected fossils.

    myIn first Report (' British Carboniferous Polyzoa,' 1880^) 1 said that

" to the Palteontologist the study of the Palteozoic Polyzoa opens up many

very important biological details; for the connection of the Polyzoa Avith

the Graptolites is a question that must be dealt with in detail."

     Since this was written I have gone over much that has been written

in this country on this debatable subject. Professor Huxley, Mr. Salter,

and Professor H. Alleyne Nicholson have severally occupied themselves

.with this question of affinity. Mr. Salter says, ' I think Professor Huxley

'first  suggested  the  resemblance  to  Defrancia ' ^                                                         his own  opinion, how-
                                                                                                            ;

ever, was very decidedly expressed. ' The point I would chiefly call

attention to is that there is a complete series up to the most compound

in this remarkable family ' ; and after pointing out the varied features of

the leading types of the GraptoUtidce, he concludes by saying ' Dendrograptus

has the branches numerous, nnsymmetrical, and crowded, while Didyonema

completes the series by showing the numerous rod-like stems each with

their cells in double rows, connected by numerous transverse bars into a

network like that of Fenestella, to which, indeed, I believe it forms the

passage group.''' Professor Nicholson, after examining in detail the
various points raised by Mr. Salter, says, ' The " polyzoarium " (of the

Polyzoa) is commonly more or less highly charged with lime, and this is

especially the case with the fossil-forms. The polypary of the Graptolites,

on the other hand, are invariably corneous (or chitinous).' ^ Notwithstand-

ing these varied opinions, I very reluctantly reviewed the whole of the

points mooted by Nicholson and others, and then submitted my notes to

Mr. Lapworth's scrutiny before publication. He has gone over every one

myof these notes critically, and, as his decision is adverse to     own views

(founded to a large extent upon facial resemblances), I cannot do other-

--wise than bow to his dictum. ' If the Polyzoa and the Graptolithina

had a common ancestor a view I have always been disposed to adopt

myself it must have existed at an antiquity far more greatly removed

from Silurian times than Silurian time is from our own ages ; for the

differences which then separated the two groups appear to have been

almost as gigantic in importance as those which divide the Hydrozoa and

Polyzoa of the present day.'

                                            ON THE SCOTTISH ZOOLOGICAL STATION.               177

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. M. Fostei{, the late
     Professor Eolleston, Mr, Pye-Smith, Professor Huxley, Dr.

    Carpenter, Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, My. F. M. Balfour, Sir C.

    Wyville Thomson, Professor Ray Lankester, Professor Allman,

    and Mr. Percy Sladen (Secretary), appointed for the purpose

     of aiding in the maintenance of the Scottish Zoological Station.

The Committee beg to report that with the aid of the grant (50?.) voted

last jeav, they have been able to assist in the maintenance of the Station

whilst at Cromarty. The most important work undertaken during this

period has been the ' Observations on the Locomotor System of the

Echinodermata,' by Mr. Romanes and Professor Ewart. The paper con-

taining the results of the investigations, having been constituted the

Croonian Lecture, was read at the meeting of the Royal Society, held on

AMarch 24.                                  short account of the work was given in 'Nature,' No. 697,

vol. 23 ; and an abstract will appear in the ' Proceedings of the Royal

Society.'

     The authors report that during their investigations they directed
attention chiefly to the structure and function of the ambulacral and

nervous systems. By injection, they satisfied themselves :

     (1) Tbat the ambulacral was independent of the blood- vascular system,
and that both systems were in communication with the external medium

--at their common origin in the madreporic plate the blood-vascular sys-

tem being in freer communication with the exterior than the ambulacral

system.

     (2) That iu the common Holothurian, the ambulacral fluid passed

from the circular canal into five small sinuses, from which it might either

enter the radial canals or the large sinuses at the bases of the tentacles.

     Of the nervous system, it was shown that in Echinus the lateral
branches from the radial trunks escaped with the pedicels and blended
with an external sub-epidermic plexus, which extended on to the spines and

pedicellariae.

     In the physiological part of the paper it was pointed out
     (1) That the natural movements of the echini exhibit great co-or-
dination, and further, that Echinoderms when inverted always right

themselves.

     (2) That Echinoderms endeavour to escape from injury in a direct
line from the source of irritation.

     (3) That the pedicels, spines, and pedicellariEe approximated when
any part of the surface of the shell was irritated.

     (4) That severe internal or external irritation had a powerful influence
on the spines and pedicels.

     (5) That starfish and echini, when their eye-spots are intact, crawl

towards the light.

     (6) That detached rays of starfish act in the same way as the entire
animal, while division of the radial nerves destroys co-ordination among

the rays.

(7) That if echini be divided into several portions, the pedicels, spines,

and pedicellarios of these portions continue to exhibit local reflex irrita-

bility                            and if a  portion  contains  an  entire  row  of pedicels,  it is able to
                               ;

crawl about and, when inverted, to right itself.

178 REPORT-- 1881.

      (8) That the pentagonal nerve-ring, throngh having no influence
on the pedicellarife or on the local reflex action of the spines, has a more
centralizing function than any other part of the nervous system.

     The work of the Station is being continued this autumn at Oban.
The Committee again respectfully solicit assistance and urge the renewal

of the grant.

     During the autumn of 1880, a total sum of 120Z. was spent in connec-
tion with the Zoological Station while at Cromarty. The 50Z. voted by
the British Association was partly used for providing apparatus and
reagents, and partly for paying for the use of a steam-launch and for

boatmen.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. M. Foster, Professor
   KoLLESTON, Mr. Dew-Smith, Professor Huxley, Dr. Carpenter,
   Dr. G-WYN Jeffreys, Mr. Sclater, Mr. F. M. Balfour, Sir C.
   Wyville Thomson, Professor Eay Lankester, Professor Allman,
   and Mr. Percy Sladen {^Secretary'), appointed for the purpose
   of arranging for the occupjation of a Table at the Zoological

    Station at Naples,

Your Committee have the pleasure of reporting the continued success

and prosperity of the Zoological Station at Naples. During the past
twelve months a greater number of naturalists have availed themselves
of the facilities there afforded for investigation than in any previous
year. This of itself is an encouraging testimony to the excellent
management of the establishment, and also forms an index of the con-
tinned and increasing support accorded to the Station by all the chief

European nations. It may be said truly, and without exaggeration, that

no institution could be more cosmopolitan in its princij^les of organisa-

of all civilised counti-ies are under a debt of gratitude to Professor
Dohrn for the energy and self-sacrifice he has Ijestowed on this noble

undertaking.

     Bach annual report issued from the Station contains an account of
some general improvement made in the laboi'atories, or of the addition
of new appliances or apparatus likely to be of service to the working
naturalist ; in fact, every opportunity is taken by the Directorate to
provide whatever the developments of modern methods of investigation
render indispensable, or even desirable, for the success of a student.

   --(Laboratory). It is scarcely necessary for this Committee to specify

in detail the various items added to this department during the past year,
and of which a full account is to be found in the last ' Bericht ilber die
Zoologische Station ' by Dr. Dohrn, published in the ' Mittheilungen aus
der Zool. Station,' Bd. ii., Heft 4. It will sufiice to mention that the
recent additions to the laboratory comprise micro-spectroscopic and

polariscopic appai^atus, a new Du Bois-Reymond section apparatus, and

also a valuable series of chemico-physiological apparatus ; the latter

through the munificence of the Berlin Academy, by whom an excellent

microscope (nf Hartnack's make) has likewise been presented. This

instrument will naturally be placed in the first instance at the disposal

of the occupant of the Academy table.

In all the small separate work-rooms, tanks similar to those in the large
laboratory have been erected, and the number of small portable breeding
aquaria has also been increased. The aerating apparatus, which have

now been in use for some time, having proved so satisfactory for develop-

mental investigations, a larger apparatus of the same description is about

to be constructed, in order to supply a current of air of greater strength

     {PiMications) The various publications undertaken by the Station,

and brought out under its auspices, are now well before the scientific

public, and have already received a worthy and well-merited meed of

praise.

     (1) Of the series entitled 'Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel'
two monographs have been issued since the last report, viz., ' Die
Ctenophoren des Golfes von Neapel ' by Dr. Carl Chun, and ' Le Specie
del Genere Fierasfer nel Golfo di Napoli ' by Dr. Carlo Emery. Three

monographs are announced to appear during the present year, viz. :

Monographic der Pantopoda (Pycnogonid^), by Prof. Anton Dohrn.

Die Corallineen, by Graf zu Solms-Laubach.

Monographic der Gattung Balanoglossus, by Dr. J. W. Spengel.

Of these the two first-mentioned are now in the press, and the plates

of Dr. Andres' monograph on the Actinite, which will be published sub-

Asequently, are already in the lithographer's hands.                                                                                                                list of twenty-two

monographs has been promised for this series up to the present date.

(2) Of the ' Mittheiluugen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'

vol. ii. is now completed, and vol. iii., part i., is in the press. Many

valuable memoirs have already been published in this periodical.
     (3) The ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' for 1879 was issued at the end

of last year, and that for 1880 is already in the press. The ' Bericht

for 1879 occupied 1,250 pp. and formed two thick volumes, comprising

the labours' of thirty-six referees. The present Report will not be less

--bulky, but will be issued with a view to the convenience of many
--naturalists in four parts. These will be independently paged, and may

be purchased separately. The division of the work will be as follows :

(Submarine Collecting). During the past two years very important

service has been rendered to the Station by the introduction of diving,

not only as a means of collecting, but also of investigating in sitit, the
fauna and flora of shallow and moderate depths. As the application of
this method to Natural History purposes is novel, the following particulars

may not be without interest.

Nearly three years ago, Dr. Dohrn conceived the idea that some of

the modern appliances for diving might be made use of for the purposes

of the Zoological Station                                                                                                           and  being  at  that  time  in  Berlin,                                                  a  journey  was
                                                                                                                                 ;

ments. The water was not especially clear where the descent was made,

in consequence  of  the bottom being somewhat muddy                                                                                                                                                                             nevertheless,

established that in the clear water of tlie Mediterranean, advantageous

results would be obtained by the employment of diving. On returning

to Italy Dr. Dohrn made application to the Italian Minister of Marine
for the loan of a ' Scaphander ' apparatus, a request which was granted

with the greatest liberality. By means of these appliances Dr. Dohrn

and several of the gentlemen of his staff have been enabled during the

--last two years to investigate, by actual inspection, the coast and sea-bed

at the following localities : The neighbourhood surrounding the Castel
deir Uovo, the "sea-bed of the Chiaja and Mergellina, all the coast and
grottos of Posilippo, the Secca della Gajola, the whole of the circum-
ference of Nisita, the bay of Baja between Pozzuoli and Capo Miseno>

the coasts of Procida and Vivara, the Secca di Vivara, different points of
the coast of Ischia, also a few at Ventotene and Ponza, as well as some
places round Capri, the Blue Grotto, the Siren Islands, and some grottos

at Amalfi. These explorations are continued as often as the weather

permits.

     Practice and experience have enabled several improvements to be

effected ; and, indeed, much more depends upon the successfal manage-
ment of the diving apparatus than upon the possession of the apparatus

itself.

     It is of primary importance that the diver should be a strong man,

--able to carry, when out of water, his 165 lbs. the weight of the dress

and its appurtenances. This is a factor upon which so much rests that

it needs especial notice. In water, however, the apparatus becomes
naturally lighter to carry the deeper the diver proceeds, and even in

four or five fathoms he is able to move about quite conveniently with
it. Por the satisfactory attainment by diving of the objects of a zoologist
or botanist, free movement on the sea-floor is unquestionably a sine

qua non.

     The mere fact of descending or of being let down is comparatively

unproductive if the diver is not able to seek out special localities where
animal and plant life is richest and most varied ; and he would even be

led to conclude that uniformity of character exists on the sea-floor. In

order that the diver may move about freely and without impediment, the

--boat which carries the air-pump must always follow his course, this

being shown by the bubbles of air which ascend from the helmet and
are continually bursting on the surface of the water. The diving-boat

should be large and strong, and will require the following complement.

Two men for rowing, two for keeping the pump continually in motion,
and, as this is fatiguing work, it will be desirable to carry an extra man

as  relief, especially  if more  than  one  person  is  diving                                 whilst  another
                                                                                            ;

--man, making five or six in all, is needed to attend to the diver's signal

rope, for the purpose of communication, the signs being given by puUing
or jerking at this rope. For further convenience, it is desirable to have

a small jolly-boat near by, canning tubs and buckets for the reception
of the stones, rock-fragments, or other booty which the diver sends up
in the net or fish-basket which is let down to him repeatedly. The diver

himself is armed with hammer and chisel, and will be able, if only

cautious that none of the glasses in his helmet are broken accidentally,

to remain an hour or two at the bottom of the sea, according as he may

wish or as his powers last. Currents are his greatest enemy, and these

are sometimes so strong as to knock the diver down, or if within reach

of the action of the waves he may be pitched about hither and thither

with such force that a strong man becomes fatigued in half an hour and

has to be drawn up again. In a tidal sea these forces must be regarded

as great hindrances to the convenient use of diving apparatus.

    It is scarcely necessary to indicate the special advantages which are

likely to accrue from the use of diving as an agent in Natural History

--research ; they are of themselves self-evident. By this means it is

possible to explore fissures, cavities, or the nnder-side of overhanging

rocks, and similar parts of the sea-bottom which are naturally inaccessible

either to the trawl or the dredge. The examination of all such places

is of the greatest importance for the collection of Sponges, Hydroids,

Actinise, I3ryozoa, and all sessile organisms ; as well as for Planarians,

Nudibranchs, and  other  MoUusca                                                                                                                                and  for                                                   the  Algae,  perhaps,  chief  of

of the description just enumerated, may be readily procured in large

quantities, whilst the association and variations of organisms may be

testimony of the excellence of manipulation, it may be mentioned that at

Prize and Gold Medal were awarded to the Zoological Station for the

preservation of marine aiaimals.

  --(The British Association Table). During the past year, two naturalists

have occupied the British Association table, viz., Mr. Francis G. Penrose

and Mr. Allen Harker. These gentlemen have furnished reports of the
investigations undertaken by them during their occupancy of the table,

in accordance with the requirements of this Committee. These reports

will be found appended below                                                                                                                                    and it is gratifying to note that interesting

results outspringing from the studies there specified will, in all probability,

be published shortly.

     Application has been made for the use of the table, during the coming

year, by Mr. Patrick Geddes, by whom important results, from a previous

short occupation of this table, in 1879, have already been published.

Mr. Geddes is now desirous of prosecuting certain special investigations

these will extend over a longer period, and Mr. Geddes will be
accompanied by an assistant, whose services are rendered necessary by

the nature of the investigations about to be undertaken.

     With tlie foregoing facts and details before them, your Committee

consideration of the additional advantages now afforded to the occupier

of a table, as specially mentioned in the last report.

I. Bejport on the Occtipation of ilie Tahle by Mr. Allen HarJcer.

By the kind permission of the Committee, I occupied the British

Association's table, at the Zoological Station, at Naples, from the 14th

Feb. to the 20th May, 1881. For the first few weeks I devoted my

attention to a general study of the comparative Morphology of the

organs of circulation and respiration in the Polych^tous Annelids, more

especially in the sedentary forms (Tubicola). I then confined myself to

the examination of one particular group, the family Maldanidm, and the

closely allied Amviocharidce, and continued my researches on these

families, as represented in the Bay of Naples, during the remainder of

my stay. I studied the histology of the remai-kable coloured bands

(ceinhires of Claparede) which adorn some of the anterior segments in

the various species of Maldanidce, with a view to tracing their relation

(if any) to the function of respiration. With that object I made some

2,000 sections, and prepared a large amount of material, which I am still

engaged in working out. The results I purpose publishing as soon as

they are completed. The frequent occurrence in the Bay of the singular
Ammochares fusiformis, Delia Chiaja, and its close relationship with
the Maldanidce, led me to make a careful study of it, in the hope of

elucidating some points in its anatomy which had been left incomplete
by Claparede. I succeeded in tracing the nervous system, in continuous

sections of the whole animal, which had (by that method) escaped the

notice of the illustrious author of 'Les Annelides du Golfe de Naples.'

The advantage of having so large a supply of this species enabled me to

examine some thousands of specimens, and to note some interesting

variations in the form of the branchial apparatus : these, too, I hope to

make public shortly, together with drawings of the special features

observed.

I had a further opportunity of studying the habits of Phyllochaitopterus

pergamentacem, and extending the observations of Claparede on the

structure of its tubes. I was (during the whole of my stay) kept

supplied with abundant material, which is so indispensable to the study

of my subject.

    In addition to the opportunity afforded of carrying out my studies
myunder the most favourable and perfect of conditions, I am indebted to

visit to the Station for much valuable knowledge of new and improved

methods of manipulation in biological research, which cannot fail to be

of lifelong service. An opportunity of putting some of that knowledge

myto a very practical use has been afforded me since  return, in fitting

up a small biological laboratory, at the Royal Agricultural College, at

Cirencester, where I have been largely guided by my Naples experiences.

     While it would be merely superfluous to add one word in praise of

the Station, I should fail in my duty were I not to record my deep

gratitude for the uniform and kindly assistance rendered by the whole of

the staff, and for the great interest which Professor Dohrn took in my

work, and the very valuable advice and assistance he was ever ready to

afford me.

For the permission to occupy the table I beg to tender my sincere

thanks.

II. Beport on the Occupation of the Tahle hy Mr. Francis G. Penrose.

      I asked for permission to use the British Association's table at

the Zoological Station at Naples, so that, as I was obliged to leave England
by medical advice at the beginning of this year, for three months,

I might, if possible, employ a portion of my time in endeavouring to get

some° practical idea of general marine zoological work, especially with

reference to the numerous invertebrate larval forms: their mode of

capture, appearance, and the means in use at the Station of preserving
them and showing their structure. The only point which I proposed to
myself for special investigation was the vascular system of LameUibranchs,

which had been suggested to me by Professor Lankester in connection

with Solen legumen.               Lacaze-Duthiers,    »·      Lt anger--

    Many eminent naturalists--as                    Agassiz,

have studied the subject, and have demonstrated many points, both in

the o-eneral course of the circulation and the channels through which the
bloocl passes. In doing so they have almost invariably had recourse to

artificial injection, which, though it has shown a great deal of much

importance, has not proved entirely successful, probably because the

arterial and venous portions of the circulatory system appear not to be

connected by definitely-walled capillary passages, but that the blood finds

its way, after leaving the arteries, amongst and between the various

tissues and organs of the body, and is only re-collected into true

sanguiniferous tubes near the great vena cava.

So that further investigation was still necessary, to decide such

questions as to whether any blood passes into the ca.vity of the pericar-
dium ; and, if so, what becomes of it ? Whether the apertures which con-
nect the vascular system with the exterior are only for the inception of

mexternal fluid ; or whether, under any circumstances, liquid contained,

the vessels is able to pass outward through them ? In fact, whether the
liquid which is so copiously thrown out by a Lamellibranch, on con-

traction, consists of blood, or of any portion of the blood-fluid ? Solen

legume7i seemed to be particularly favourable for the study of these

questions, as the blood of this animal, besides possessing ordinary

colourless corpuscles, is particularly rich in bright red corpuscles,

discovered by Professor Lankester, and shown by him to contain
hsemoglobin, which forms a perfectly natural injection; and, as will be

seen from what has been said above, this is a point of very great
importance. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the exertions made to

obtain for me as many individuals of this species as possible, but very

few were forthcoming, and those were nearly all full-grown, which were

not very suitable, owing to the want of transparency and to the practical

diCBculties of manipulation,--the slightest injury rendering the individual

useless for the research. But, from what I saw in them, I venture to
think that, had it been possible to obtain younger specimens, they would

have enabled me to settle those questions I was hoping to answer. As a

definite result, I consider that (at any rate, in the only individual that

allowed me a favourable examination) there were not any red corpuscles

in the cavity of the pericardium, excepting, of course, those contained

within the heart. In conclusion, I have to thank the staff at the Station

for the constant facilities and assistance they afforded me.

1881. Feb.
                                                                ON THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.                           IQQ

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown,
   3Ir. John Cordeaux, and Professor Newton, appointed at
   Swansea for the purpose of ohtaininfj (tvith the consent of the
   Master and Brethren of the Trinity House, and of the Com-
   missioners of Northern Lights) observations on the Migration

   of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and of reporting on

   the same, at York, in 1881.

Printed schedules for filling in observations, accompanied by letters

of instruction (similar to those laid on the table), were issued by
Mr. Cordeaux and Mr. Harvie Brown to 83 stations on the east coast of
Scotland and England and the Channel Islands, a large proportion of
these being light-vessels, situated far from land in the North Sea.

    On the west coast of Scotland and the Western Isles, includino- the
Isle-of-Man, Mr. Harvie Brown supplied papers to 38 stations.

    And on the West Coast of England Mr. Philip Kermode, of Ramsey,

Isle-of-Man (whose kind assistance the Committee desire gratefully to
acknowledge), issued papers to 39 lighthouses and lightvessels.

Altogether the stations from which co-operation was asked number

160.

    From these, returns have been received from 103, namely : east coast
stations, 46 ; west coast stations, 57. From several stations letters

have also been received, stating that the scarcity, or total absence of
birds, has prevented any return being.sent in.

Schedules, letters of instructions, were also forwarded, throuo-h

Mr. Alexander Buchan (Secretary, Scottish Meteorological Society,

AEdinburgh) to three stations, two in Iceland and one in Faroe.                                             fourth'
more northern station, is secured on Fair Island for 1881, Mr. Williaui

Lawrence having kindly undertaken the work. The Faroe station has

failed this year, but the Committee hope better things from it next.

The Committee have also made arrangements with Mr. Alexander
Goodman More, of Glasneviu, Dublin, and Mr. Richard M. Barrington,

of Fassaroe, Co. Wicklow, to undertake the working of the Irish coast in
1881, and beg leave to suggest that these gentlemen, as well as Mr. Philip

Kermode, before mentioned, and Mr. James Hardy, of Old Cambus,

Berwickshire (who has rendered great assistance to the Committee in

the Scotch stations), be added to the Committee, should it be re-appointed.

 Great                                               credit is  due  to  the  various  observers  for  the  careful  and

_

painstaking manner in which the greater proportion of the returned

schedules have been sent in. The observations taken are a decided
improvement on those of the preceding year, when the men were new to
the work
                                                  ;  and they exhibit generally, in a marked degree, the    intelligent

interest taken in the inquiry. The work, it must be remembered, is

entirely voluntary, and often carried on under circumstances of consider-

able difficulty and discomfort.

The Committee beg to express their best thanks to the Master and
Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, and the Commissioners of Northern

mLights, for then- ready co-operation and assistance, through their officers,
and men,                                             the inquiry. Indeed, without the help thus afi'orded, the

observations could never have been obtained.

The best returns, as might have been expected, have been sent in
190 EEPORT 1881.

from isolated stations, at lighthouses on islands and skerries off the
coast, as well as from the lightvessels. Lighthouses situated some
distance inland, or surrounded by houses, make few returns, or none.

     In presenting their report, your Committee are aware that the
inquiry is as yet in its infancy. Their work, so far, has been mainly to
collect and tabulate sufficient data, from which they have every reason

to expect that, at some future time, reliable facts may be deduced on the
migratory movements of birds in their spring and autumn migrations.

The results of the observations taken so far, in 1879 and 1880, have
proved so satisfactory and unexpected that the Committee have been able,

with tolerable certainty, to arrive at the following conclusions :

    On the east coasts of England and Scotland, as in 1879, the main

line of migration has been a broad stream from east to west, covering
the whole of the English and Scotch east-coast ; this is the line mainly

followed by the Passeres. Taking this line as a basis, we find birds

also occasionally coming from points north of east, but, in the vast
majority of instances, the migration has had a decidedly southerly trend,
coming from points south of east, and even direct from the southward.
In 1879 the main body of immigrants crossed at the most southern
stations, at the narrowest parts of the North Sea, and direct into our
south-eastern counties ; in 1880 the main body has been tolerably
equally divided between the mid and south-eastern counties. During
the principal month of migration, October, the wind blew persistently,
day by day and week by week, from northei'ly and north-easterly

quarters, and to this cause we may fairly attribute, to some extent, the

deflection of migrants to the south ; on the north-east coast of England

and the stations on the east-coast of Scotland birds are reported as
comparatively scarce, and in some instances absent altogether.

A reference to the meteorological charts in the ' Times ' shows that, in

the autumn of 1880, the prevailing winds and gales were from the east
and north-east, and while these winds do not appear to have compressed
the horizontal lines so much as the north-westerly did, in 1879, the birds
appear to have passed at greater elevations and, in many cases, to have
been borne far to the westward of these islands. The migration does not
appear to have come in such great throbs or ' rushes ' in 1880 as in 1879,
but to have been more dispersed and more regular ; this, no doubt, is a
natural consequence of the waves being more spread out in 1880 than in

1879.

     Independent of the broad stream of immigrants coming directly
from the east, there is, in the autumn, always a steady stream of
migrants which closely follow the coast-line from north to south,
composed of birds either moving from more northerly districts of our
islands, or of such immigrants coming from the east as strike the coast
in more northern latitudes, and then follow it to the south. The great

E. to W. stream of migration is mainly composed of some few

well-known species, which regularly come to us in the autumn, the great
body undoubtedly remaining to winter. Placed in order of rotation,

according to their numerical superiority or otherwise, we find the Skylark,

Starling, Hooded Grow and Book, the Song Thrusli, Blackbird, Fieldfare

and Redwing ; and then Sparrows (both the common species and tree-

sparrow), and Linnets, and Chaffinches compose the bulk of the immigrants.
Others, as the Redstart, Wheatear, Whinchat and Stonechat, and other
soft-billed insect-eaters, although coming from the eastward, after striking
                      ON THE MIGRATION OP BIRDS.                                                                         191

the coast, persistently follow the shore-line to the south, blithe waders
and other shore-birds, as well as Geeae, Bucks, Divers, and Gulls, and

--sea-fowl generallj', move from north to south cutting the line of the

Passeres at right angles. As a rule, the sea- fowl migrate some distance out
at sea, the waders along the coast. Although, as yet, the Committee
have no stations, except Heligoland, on the European side of the North
Sea, it may fairly be presumed that there is similarly another stream of
birds passing down the coast-line of Europe. Migration, as observed on

that island for many years, by that veteran ornithologist, Herr Gatke,

points to the undoubted fact that the line followed by birds is, as a rule,

from E. to W., and doubtless some portion of these Heligoland birds

keep moving westward or south-westward till, eventually, they strike

our east coast. There are, however, many species which appear to make
Heligoland the western iDoundary of their autumn wanderings, and

crossing, as they do, that island in enormous numbers, must eventually

follow the coast-line to the south, for the simple reason that they never

occur on our own coast, except as very rare and occasional wanderers.

Such are the WJdte-Wagtail and Blue-headed Wagtail of the Continent,

the Blue-throat, Ortolan, Lapland Bunting, Richard's Pipit, and, in a
less degree, the Pied-flycatcher and Shore-lark. These, then, must all
pass southward along the European coast, as do, doubtless, an immense
majority of those countless Sparrow-haivks, Siskins, and more familiar

birds,  which  cross  that  island  in  the  autumn  migration                                                and  just  as,
                                                                                                           ;

occasionally, some species, whose line of migration lies further eastward

still, turn up on the old rock as wanderers from the regular track, so do,

occasionally, now one and now another of the regular Heligoland

immigrants get blown across to our side.

     The observations taken at some of the southern stations, in 1879 and
1880, show that, in the autumn, there is what may be called a double

stream of birds, crossing each other near the entrance to the English

Channel, that is, from the Essex and Kent coast towards the S.E. on the

French and Belgian coast, and again, in the opposite direction, from

Belgium to the coast of Kent. During the severe weather in the early

part of December, 1880, flocks of birds came to us direct from the

French coast, or from S. to N. These latter must be considered purely

local migrations, caused by sudden outbursts of severe weather.

It is a curious fact that, in nearly every case of birds passing the

Casquets off Alderney, in the past autumn, they were travelling in a

N.W. direction, or from the French to the English coast, a line of

migration which does not seem to be in proper accord with that

we should imagine migrating birds would, or rather ought to, take.

On reference to the chart of the Channel, it is apparent that any flocks

leaving the French coast at or near Cape de la Hogue, and crossing

Alderney, when once off the Casquets, might as readily and easily steer

their course for the Start Point, on the English side, as across the wide

break in the French coast for Port Sillon, each being about equal distances

from the Casquets. Not the least interesting portion of the full report

refers to the large flocks of birds seen during the autumn of 1880 far

out over the Atlantic. The great easterly gales, continuing for weeks

together over the Atlantic and North of Europe, so disastrous to our
shipping, undoubtedly carried many migrants far to the westward, and

the mortality amongst them must have been very great indeed, to judge

from the few records that have arrived from seagoing vessels. These
192 REPORT-- 1881.

gales have also, no doubt, affected the direction of the migration to a

considerable extent, and indications of this agency may be found in the
occurrence, on our shores, of many rare wanderers, in the autumn of

1880.

Notwithstanding the enormous number of immigrants arriving, as

shown in the schedules returned from each station, it is quite certain that

these returns only represent an almost inappreciable percentage of the

actual number on passage. On days of uncertain light, or on clear, fine,
starlight nights, when migration is carried on at a considerable height,

immense numbers of birds might pass any of the stations for hours

without being observed ; and it is quite possible that, if the whole 300
miles of the east-coast line of England were studded with floating posts

of observation at the distance of half-a-mile, equal average results would

have been obtained ; the present stations on the light-vessels affording no

more especial line of advantage than any other imaginary line drawn

across the North Sea.

As, in 1879, birds have crossed at all hours of the day and night, and

in all winds and weathers. The returns also shoM^ as did the preceding,

that they seldom fly dead to windward, except with very light breezes,

and that strong opposing winds are invariably prejudicial to their passage.

The line of flight mostly adopted is within three or four points of the

wind                           they  will go on well with a beam- wind,  or some points     even  aft o£
                            ;

beam, if not too strong. Small weak-winged birds have often, as noticed

on the light-vessels, great difficulty in making head against strongly-

opposing winds. If the wind changes during the actual passage, birds

have been observed to change the direction of their flight to suit the

wind. Even the sti-ong-winged wild geese and swans are observed, when

well-up in the wind, to drift to one side a little, having the appearance of

flying left shoulder first instead of head first.

Birds are noticed at the stations as sometimes flying high, sometimes

low                      often       with  northerly  and  easterly winds  they fly  high,  and   with
                      ;

winds in opposite quarters, low. The state of the weather at the time of

migration has more, we think, to do with the height at which birds travel

than the direction of the wind. On clear light nights they travel high,

--as a rule ; but in fog, rain or snow, or in thick murky weather, low not

many feet above the waves. On thick dark nights, indeed, lost birds will

wheel for hours round a light-vessel, but with the first break in the

clouds, the stars appearing, or streak of early dawn, are on their course

again to the nearest land. At times birds are seen passing high in aii*,
almost beyond the ken of human vision, and when clouds or fogs rapidly

lift or clear off during the time of migration, the said migration appears

often to cease to mortal vision, indicating an ascent to a higher level.

Birds are also known to descend upon Heligoland and the light-vessels

almost perpendicularly from the sky, indicating a course of migration at

a great height. The height at which birds travel in foggy weather, or in
snow or rain, has probably a good deal to do with the various numerical

returns of those killed at lanterns. Broadly speaking it is the brightest,

whitest, fixed lights which, having most influence in penetrating fog or

haze, attract the most birds. In 1877, at Skerryvore, in the month of
October, the number of birds killed was 600, chiefly the common thrush
and the ring-ousel. This year the mortality has been heavy at some of

the light-vessels. At the Casquets, off Aldemey, on October 7, from

11 P.M. to 3 A.M., S.S.E., rain, land-rails, water-rails, woodcocks, ring-
                                                                        ON THE MIGIUTION OP BIRDS.                                193

ousels, song-thrushes, and swallows were seen around the lirrbt. Of

these there struck the glass : one land- rail, one water-rail, four ring-

ousels, and 100 swallows. At the Casquets, wliich is a revolving light

the larger birds follow the rays, but do not often strike the glass.

Some of the reporters state extreme height above the sea, as a cause of

birds seldom or never striking the glass, or being seen hovering around
the light. Certainly returns show a preponderance of deaths first at
light- vessels, whose average height above the sea is only a few feet ·

secondly, at such stations as the Bell-rock, Dhuheartach or Skerry-
vore, whose lanterns are not higher than sixty or seventy feet above

the sea.

     With such favourable passages as light head-winds afford, the
migrants are so little fatigued that they do not alight on reaching land,
but keep on their course to the interior. At other times with adverse

winds they drop on reaching the shore, being hardly able to struggle to

land.

     The observations show beyond doubt that all birds are migratory (if
we except our common game-birds, and perhaps the green woodpecker).
Even such comparatively weak-winged birds as the gold-crested ivren,
common wren, the titmice, hedge-sparrow, common sparrow, and redbreast

change their locality, crossing the North Sea in large numbers. At

Heligoland, Herr Giitke remarks (in the very comprehensive and highly

interesting notes sent to us), ' Up towards the end of July, all yoano-

sparrows disappeared from the island,' and ' up to the middle of Sep-

tember nearly all old sparrows had quitted' the island.' On October 10

there was ' an influx of fresh sparrows,' probably arriving from some
more northern region.

As a rule, the young of the year migrate some weeks in advance of

the old birds                                                           this holds good with all orders and almost all  species.  In
                                                                     ;

the spring the males often migrate in advance of the females. In sprint,

birds migrate, with rare exceptions, at night, and as the weather is then

finer, and the nights shorter and clearer, do not fly low and run their heads

so much against the lanterns of lighthouses and lightships. The sprint
migration is also carried on much more leisurely, migrants;' proceeding

by easy slopes northward, and there are none of those great ' waves
or ' rushes ' which are so characteristic of the autumn migration. The

notes on spring migi-ation taken in 1879 and 1880 point also to the con-

clusion that, at this season, migrants strike the glasses of lanterns fi'om

11 P.M. to the dawn of day, the majority after midnight, and not also in

the early hours of night, as is the case in the autumn.

    It is remarkable how suddenly the stream of migration commences
running, and how suddenly it stops again ; it may be from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.

there is a continual stream of various migrants arriving on our coasty,
and then, or at least for that day, migration is apparently over, and not

another bird is seen.

The time of migi-ation of any particular species extends over a con-

siderable period. Sometimes it is over four or five weeks, in other cases

going on for months or even half-a-year. Indeed, birds seem to be
crossing the North Sea all the year round, and no sooner does the ebb of

-- --the autumn migration cease and it is prolonged into February than

the flood sets in, and birds are passing northward again. In every case

of normal migration, any given species will continue to pass day by day,
or week after week, till it attains the maxinaum in ^ ' great rush,' the

                                                                                                                                             '

      1881.
--194 KEPORT 1881.

main body passing, and after this falls away, till the migration of that

species ceases or is completed.

     Independent of the normal or ordinary migration we have frequently

local migrations, due to sudden changes of weather, or in search of fresh
feeding-grounds. These ' great rushes ' of immigrants coming helter-
skelter on to our coasts, are, as will be seen from the Report, often accom-
panied, or followed very closely, with outbursts of severe weather ; and
a sudden increase of cold in winter will almost clear a whole district

of birds.

    In 1879 the maximum of immigrahts crossed the North Sea between

the 12th to the 2.3rd of October ; in 1880, between the 15th and end of
the same month ; in both years, perhaps the greatest number on any
given day on the 17th of the month. It is a curious fact that the
stomachs of migratory birds on their first landing never contain any

food.

AThis is as much as can be set forth in an abstract.  full aiid detailed

account of the Migration of Birds in the Autumn of 1880, will be found

in the General Report, which contains much interesting matter bearing

on migration. It may be added finally, that in endeavouring to arrive

at any conclusions regarding the causes of migrational phenomena in

1880, as set forth in the General Report, the Committee have taken

more account of the vertical area of birds' flight in 1880 than in 1879,

and have compared the effects of prevailing north-west winds in 1879

pressing laterally upon the lines of migration with those of 1880, which

being easterly and north-easterly, have had the contrary effect of spread-

ing out the migratory wave, or at least not deflecting it to the same
extent, and also causing birds to migrate at greater elevations, and where
the gales have been most severe to bear them away above the range of
vision and carry vast numbers out to sea, until, weary and exhausted,

they have ceased to be able to guide themselves, and involnntai'ily
lowered, to be picked up senseless and stunned on board the ships, or to
perish in thousands in the ocean. And, lastly, the Committee have

hinted at the wideness of the migratory waves depending upon the

pressure of the starting-points, or upon, perhaps, a larger north and

south area occupied in the breeding season of 1880.

     The data, however, are not yet sufiicient, nor have the observations
been carried on sufficiently long, to ai'rive at any positive conclusions as to
the lioiu and the luhy of the whole matter. The Committee must, there-

fore, for the present, be satisfied to say nothing more, but trust that the

Association will enable it to continue the collection of facts.

and land shells (3L 2s.), making a balance of 36Z. 19s. IQd. now in the

hands of the Committee for future operations.
     The greater part of the zoological collection made by Professor Balfour

has now been worked out, chiefly by the. Assistants in the Zoological
Department of the British Museum, to which institution the first complete

series of zoological specimens of every class has been assigned.

     The following are some of the more remarkable points touched upon

in these reports :

     The Birds, reported upon by Mr. Sclater and Dr. Hartlaub, are found

--to belong to thirty-six species generally 'North-east African in character,

being mostly such as are included in Heiiglin's " Ornithologie Nord-ost-
Afrikas." ' Six, however, are peculiar to the island, the most remarkable of

them being a new form of sparrow with a very thick bill, which is named
by Messrs. Sclater and Hartlaub Ixhyncliostmthus socotranus.

     Mr. Butler's report on the Butterflies and Moths captured by Professor

Bayley Balfour and his assistants in Socotra, tells us that of the thirteen

species of which examples were brought, not less than seven were new
to science. ' Of the new forms five are allied to previously-recorded types

--from the following localities : one from the Comoro Islands, one from

South-west Africa, one from Zanzibar, and two from Arabia. Without

the help of these last two it would therefore have been impossible for
anyone not acquainted with it to guess at the locality from which this
collection had been obtained.'

     The Reptiles collected by Professor Balfour in Socotra have been

worked out by Dr. Giinther and Mr. W. T. Blanford, Dr. Giinther taking

the Snakes and AmphisbiBuians, and Mr. Blanford the remaining Laccr-
tilians. Both of these collections were found to be of considerable

interest. Among the snakes is a new form allied to Tachijmenis, which
Dr. Giinther has proposed to call Bitypophis, and a new species of Zamenis

{Z. soootrce): Both these indicate an allistnce with the circum-Mediter-

 ranean fauna. On tlie other hand the Socotran Sand-Asp {Echis colorata)

 belongs to an Arabian and Palestine species, while the Amphisbaena of
 Socotra {Fachycalamus brevis, gen. et sp. nov.) has its nearest allies in
 Eastern and Western Tropical Africa. Of the six species of lizards of

 which examples were in Mr. Blanford's series, three proved to be new to

 science.

     As regards the Land Shells of Socotra, which are of special interest,
we annex a special report upon this branch of the subject drawn up by

 Lieut.-Colonel Godwin-Austen, one of the Committee.

     From this report and from what has been already stated, it will be

--obvious that, although the collections made by Professor Balfour were

very small in each group in some cases almost of a fragmentary
character, the results in every case present features of great interest. It
is obvious that, judging from what is thus known, Socotra must possess

--what was thought scarcely probable by many at the time the scheme
--for exploring it was first started an indigenous fauna of considerable

extent, and well worthy of further investigation. As regards the flora
of Socotra we have said nothing, because Professor Balfour, who has

himself undertaken the investigation of the botanical collections, has not

yet completed his task. But a preliminary examination has shown, we
believe, that his series embraces about 150 absolutely new ilowering

--plants, amongst which are from fifteen to twenty representatives of new

genera so that it is manifest that, like the fauna, the flora of Socotra
possesses a strong autochthonous element.

     Under these circumstances, we trust that the Committee for the
investigation of the Natural History of Socotra may be re-appointed, with

its sphere extended so as to embrace the adjoining highlands of Arabia and
Somali-land, without the exploration of which it is not possible that a
true understanding of the flora and fauna of Socotra can be aiTived at

and that the sum of 2001. may be assigned to the Committee for this

purpose.

Beport on the Socotran Land and Freshivater Shells collected hy Professor
        Balfour, hy Lieut.-Colonel H. H. Godwin-Austen, F.B.S.

     Since the last meeting of the British Association the land and freshwater

shells of Socotra, which were assigned to me to work out, have been nearly

all described, and quite come up to the expectations I was led to form of
them at a first inspection. The Cyclostomacese were described in a paper
which was read before the Zoological Society in February, 1881, illustrated
by two plates ; the Pulmonata, in June, also illustrated by two plates. In
the first paper, we find that no less than seven species of Otojioma (Africo-
Arabian) were brought home, of which four are quite new, viz., 0. halfouri,
complanatum, conicum, and turhinatutn : Tropidophora (Madagascar-Rod-
riguez), two species, T. socotrana and halfouri: Lithidion (Arabia), one

--species, L. marmorosum, and a Cyclotopsis (Southern India Seychelles),

perhaps the most interesting form discovered by Professor Balfour in this
island, which 1 have named ornatus. This is another example of the con-
nection between Southern India on one side of the Arabian Sea and Africa
on the other. The Pulmonata are more numerous and mostly belong to
a sub-genus of the Bulimnli, Achatinelloides, Nevill, created for the very

common Socotran shell BuUmulus socotorensis of Pfeiffer. All the allied

species on the island I have pat into this group until we know more
Weabout the land shells of the mainland near Cape Guardafai.
                                                                  have

altogether ten species in this genns ; some of them very prettily marked

forms. One group of BuUmulus is very peculiar, and in form and colora-

tion approaches B. velntinus, Pfr., from the Seychelles Islands.

Of the genus Ennea we have one form already known, passamiana,

Petit, and a new species which I have named after Professor Balfour.

Of the Stenogyrida3 there are some fine shells ; one elongate form,

which is used as a pipe by the natives of the island, I have named

fumificatus ; the other species are gollonsirensis, adonaensis, Jessica, and

Aenodis.  Sululina with hairy epidermis (hirsuta) closes the list, with one

Pupa (rupicola). These twenty-two togetherwith eleven operculated species

give a total of thirty- three. It is a curious fact that there is not a single

Helix in the collection. The freshwater shells I have not yet had time to

Av7ork out.  number of small forms have been brought home on the water

plants that were collected, and these I have been taking out. I find among

them examples of the following genera and species :

Planorbis, no less than three species, one large.

     Bithinea, one very small form.
     Melania, four or five ; one very beautiful spined species, reminding one

of a similar form from Ceylon. One Gerithium occurred with these.
    I have alluded to how little is known of the mainland of Africa, near

Cape Gaardafui. When this has been examined, and it is very necessary it
should be, we shall know more as regards the range of some of these

Socotran forms ; and I hope that the British Association will be able to

assist a naturalist to visit this district.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. Sclater, Mr. Howard

   Saunders, and Mr. Thiselton Dyer, appointed for the purpose

   of investigating the Natural History of Timo7'-laut.

In a letter addressed to Sir Joseph Hooker, Director of the Royal
Gardens, Kew, Mr. H. O. Forbes wrote from Sumatra, oSering, if some

--assistance could be forwarded him, to attempt an expedition to Timor-

laut for the purpose of investigating its natural history ' an object,' as
Mr. Forbes states, ' the accomplishment of which is desired both by

botanists and zoologists.' An application on Mr. Forbes's behalf was
accordingly made to the British Association, and a sum of 501. was voted

by the General Committee at the Swansea Meeting to be placed at the

disposal of the Committee, to whom the conduct of the matter was

entrusted.

     The action taken by the Association was communicated to Mr.
Forbes,* and the letter, of which a copy is annexed, was received in reply.
This is the most recent information which the Committee possess as to his
plans. It is somewhat doubtful whether, owing to insufficiency of funds,
he was able to start. At any rate, the grant made at Swansea remains

in the hands of your Committee.

     The expedition is obviously attended with some difficulty, if not
danger. Its success must be largely dependent on fortunate accident.
198 REPORT-- 1881.

Tour Committee, however, think that there is a reasonable chance of
the work being done, and therefore recommend their reappointment, and
that a further sum of lOOL be placed at their disposal.

                                                                                                     December 8, 1880.

     Sir Joseph Hooker,

       --Dear Sir, ^Accept my warmest thanks for the kind interest you

have taken in my intended visit to Timor-laut, which has obtained for

me a grant of 50Z. frona the Council of the British Association.
    For the present I am engaged in Sumatra, but about the end of

February, or beginning of March, I intend to return to Batavia, in order

to make my way to Timor-laut. His Excellency the Governor- General
kindly placed at my disposal such ships of the Dutch Navy as might be

on the Amboina Station going down towards the Tenimber Islands. I

have, however, given up the hope of being able to accomplish my object if

I travel by this means, as the islanders are at best not very friendly, and

by landing from a man-of-war I am not likely to meet with greater

favour. I mean, therefore, to attemjit the journey in one of the Arab

prahus instead, which go there to jjurchase horses. I have been fortunate

in securing the friendly assistance of the highest rank Arab in Java, a

very clever influential man (the Native Master of Ceremonies to the

Governor), whose brother is one of the largest traders to the Eastward

Islands. He has offered to send forward intimation of my coming, and to do

his best to secure, as far as he can, the goodwill towards me of the natives,
with whom his countrymen deal.

    Neither the time of my departure nor of my return can I positively

fix ; the former date depends on the state of the monsoon, which these
few years back has been very irregular, the latter on the amount of

goodwill which the natives show towards me. If I find them not very ill-

affected towards strangers, I may extend my stay over the diy monsoon,
and do my best to hold out till the return of the trading season at the

end of nest wet monsoon.

myIf, therefore, the British Association grant be placed at  disposal,

I shall draw upon it only on my actual departure for Timor-laut. Not-

withstanding the very bad character given to the Tenimber Islanders by

the Dutch officials, I have good reason to think that the perils are much

exaggerated ; and I hope for the best.

    Again offering you, and those who so kindly supported the application

made on behalf of the exploration of Timor-laut, my best thanks,

                          Believe me, yours obediently,

                                        (Signed)  H. O. Forbes.

Report on the Marine Fauna of the Southern Coast of Devon and
   GornivaU,by Spence Bate, F.R.S., and J. Brooking Rowe, F.L.S.

In presenting our report on the exploration of the marine fauna of the

south-western coast of England, we beg to state that we have carried on
a series of dredgings off the coast between Plymouth and Falmouth, more
especially off the district known as the Dudman.
ON THE MARINE FAUNA OF SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL. 199

    Here, in from forty to sixty fathoms, we have invariably met with

some of our most interesting forms, such as are considered of the rarer

species belonging to our British fauna.

Hitherto among Crustacea we have taken species of Nika, Typton,

Nephropsis, Caridina, Callianassa, and other forms that have generally

been considered as very rare, and this year we have taken, at a depth

of fifty-five fathoms, a considerable number of Pagurus sculptimanus of

Lucas, a species that the late Prof. Bell has described in his ' History of

British Stalk-eyed Crustacea,' under the name of Pagurus forhesii, under

--the impression that it was an undescribed form a single specimen of

which was sent to him with others from the coast of Falmouth.

This is the first time that this species has been taken in British

waters since Bell received his specimen, which is now in the British

Museum (whither we propose sending some of the recently dredged

specimens),  from  the  late  Dr.  Cocks, some thirty-five  or  forty years  since
                                                                                                          ;

a fact that appears to suggest that the word ' rare,' as used in relation

to our knowledge of species, merely represents our want of knowledge of

the natural habitat of the animal.

    An example of this may be seen in the following passage from Pro-

fessor Bell's work on Pohjhius lienslowii, ' which is very local in its dis-
tribution, and probably nowhere existing in great numbers'; whereas
I have recently been informed by Mr. F. Day, that it has been thrown up

on the shores of Mount's Bay, this spring, after a strong south-western
gale, in such quantities that it is thought that along the shore there

could not have been less that two tons in weight.
     Again, the little crustacean which Bell has described as Thysanopoda

couchii, and of which he states, on the authority of Couch, that it is found
in ' myriads in the stomach of the mackerel and other fish,' Mr. Couch

had not found since, although he was in the habit of searching the

stomachs of mackerel and other fishes. Our experience is confirmatory

of that of Mr. Couch, inasmuch as we have only obtained it one season,
and then in abundance from the stomachs of fish. And recently we have
had our attention drawn to a parallel fact in the Indian seas, from
whence Professor Milne-Edwards described, under the name of Acetes
indicus, in 1829, a small crustacean, that, as far as we are aware, has not
been noticed since yet Sir Walter Elliot has given us a carefully drawn

                                                                                      ;

figure of the same, with the remark that it was found in the stomach of

a very large Dicerobetes, taken off the coast of Malabar in such quantities

that basketfuls were carried away by the fishermen, and thousands left

scattered about the shore.

    In referring still to the Crustacea we beg to draw attention^ to the

--fact that many of the specimens recorded from this locality that is, from
--the deeper water at the entrance of the English Channel are species that

are common to the Mediterranean Sea, while others, such as Mtmida-

barnficus, as also others of less noticeable forms, have their centre of

radiation near the arctic zones.

     Although it has been several times demonstrated that deep-sea species
have a large geograpical distribution, yet it is interesting to observe that
some of our long-shore species have been represented by specimens that

appear to be identical in the eastern seas. Thus the common Grangon

vulgaris has its representative at Japan, or one that cannot, on the closest
analysis, be distinguished from it. This is also found to be the case with

one of our specimens ofCa^prella {Gap-ella ccpiilibra) as well as other species.
200 EEPOM-- 1881.

   We are therefore much inclined to believe that by a series of deep- Water

--explorations by which we mean the dredge and deep-water tow-nets,

--situated so as to sweep the sea at each successive fifty fathoms of water
   very interesting and valuable results would be obtained. It is our

strong conviction that many of the specimens recorded from very great

depths are inhabitants of mid-water rather than dwellers at the sea-

bottom, from whence they are supposed to have been brought.

Hitherto we have had at our command only fishermen's trawlers and

shore-boats                                                      but to  explore  the  deep  water  that  surrounds  the  south-
                                                              ;

western limits of Cornwall and the Scilly Islands would require vessels

of larger tonnage and greater power than we have been able to procure

with the grant placed at our disposal.

    Among the fish and other animals, numerous specimens of various

species have been procured. Those that are the most seldom met with on

our coast have been preserved ; and here we would like to record that
specimens offish and Crustacea which have been preserved, as recommended

by us at the meeting of the British Association at Brighton, and have been

so kept for several years, are soft and flexible, and retain much of the

colours of living specimens.

Numerous annelids and zoophytes have also been obtained, but we

have not to record any that appear to be new or differ from those that

have been reported by us in the lists already published.

As soon as our specimens are all arranged and tabulated, we hope to

forward some to the British Museum, and present the rest to the Museum

of the Plymouth Institution.

Report of the Committee^ consisting of Professor A, C. Ramsay and
    Professor John Milne {Secretary\ appointed for the ptirpose of
   investigating the Earthquake Phenomena of Japan.

The Seismological work which I have been engaged upon since the British
Association generously placed the grant of 25Z. in the hands of Andrew
Ramsay, Esq., and myself as an assistance towards the investigation of
the earthquake phenomena of Japan, has been partly a continuance of
experiments and observations commenced four years ago, and jiartly the
commencement of experiments more or less new.

     The results of work which has been accomplished has been almost
wholly read before the Seismological Society of Japan, and will very

shortly appear in its Transactions.

     The work which I have been engaged upon since receiving the grant

has been as follows :

I. Attemjjis to determine the area from which the shakings so often felt in
                                 Toldo and Yokohama emanate.

    To do this, instruments intended to record the direction and maximum

amplitude of an earthquake were placed at four points, from 10 to 20
miles apart, round the upper portions of Yedo Bay. For the shakings
of January 7, 22, and 24 of this year, lines drawn parallel to the direction
                                                  ON THE EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA OF JAPAN.  201

of motion at these different stations intersect each other in a number of
points between Yokohama and Kanasawa.

     Although several other earthquakes have had their origin localised in
the same district, there remain several, the origin of which has not been

localised, the records of direction being probably in many cases, and

certainly in some, a confusion of normal and transverse vibrations.

     As a confirmation of these results, I find by a careful series of time

observations made by myself in Tokio and in Yokohama, by Mr. W. H.

Talbot, for the accuracy of which we are indebted to the telegraph
department who daily furnished us with a time-signal, that many shocks

have been felt about 30 seconds in the latter place before they were felt

in the former.

    The facts that in Yokohama small earthquakes are sometimes felt

which are not recorded in Tokio, and also that at the time of a severe

shock the vertical motion appears to be greater in Yokohama than in
Tokio, may also be taken as indications that the origin of many of the
recent earthquakes has been nearer to Yokohama than to Tokio.

    In order to make the localisation of the various shocks more certain,
I have very recently established instruments in Tokio and Yokohama

which give graphical records of both the normal and transverse vibrations.

When similar instruments have been established at the remaining stations,

the complete distinction between these two sets of vibrations may, inde-

pendently of the interest that these records have of themselves, assist us

to determine the origin of nearly all the earthquakes we feel.

The district where several shocks have had their origin already

localised is one showing numerous faults, and one which shows exceed-

ingly clear evidence of recent elevations. As it is very possible that this
district may still be rising, one probable inference we might make is that
faults are still being formed, and are due to the elevations, and that

the earthquakes are to us the announcement of the formation of these

fractures.

    As confirmatory of this idea we may say that, first, the records of
earthquakes, as written by our seismographs, usually commence gently,
then have several maxima and minima, and finally die out as they com-

menced                                       and  secondly, the  testimony of  our feelings leads us to believe
                                          ;

that there is a sliding, jolting kind of motion, as might be produced by one

mass of rock slipping over another.

    Further, I may remark that recently, since having more perfect in-

struments which record each successive vibration of the earth, both in

regard to time and space, I have recorded shocks in Tokio with a motion
almost entirely east and west, whilst the time observations showed that
they must have come from the south, which is the faulted district.

     Assuming that these records are correct, and I have no reason to

believe that they are not so, it would seem that from the faulted district

in the south it is possible to receive an earthquake consisting only of

transverse vibrations.

Such an earthquake we can imagine might be produced by a fault

giving rise to an elastic wave of distortion.
    If the earthquakes were produced by a blow we should have a wave

of compression with normal vibrations, followed by a wave of distortion,

with transverse vibrations.

     Observations bearing on these points I hope to carry out during the
coming year.
--202 REPORT 1881.

          II. Observations to determine the nature of Tjarthquahe-motion.

    With the help of specially contrived seismographs, so far as my ob-

--servations have hitherto gone, it is shown 1st. That the actual horizontal

motion of an eaTth-particle at the time of an earthquake is very much
smaller than we anticipated from our senses, being seldom over a few

millimetres and often under one millimetre.
     2ndly. The backward and forward motion of the ground is very ir-

regular, both in regard^to space and time.
     Srdly. That there are seldom more than two or three complete vi-

lirations per second.

    These observations, I am pleased to say, have been confirmed by a
more complete series of records than my own, obtained by Professor

Ewing.

   A4thly. motion often takes place in more than one direction. Both

at the Yokohama station and the Tokio station records have been

obtained of two sets of irregular ellipses crossing each other nearly at
right angles, these ellipses being drawn by the pointer of a seismogi-aph
moving over a smoked glass plate at rest beneath it.

    For the same earthquake this diiference in direction may be experienced

at one station, but not at another, 15 or 20 miles distant.

     From records obtained it would seem possible that at Yokohama both
transverse and normal vibrations may be recorded, whilst at Tokio, six-
teen miles distant, only the former are recorded. As these latter obser-

vations need confirmation, I hope during the coming year to be able,
with the help of a few similar instruments placed at different stations, to
obtain records of a series of shakings, to show the relation between the
dying out of one set of vibrations as compared with the dying out of

another.

                               Ill, The recording of Eartli-tremors.

     With the help of a specially- contrived instrument, by which a motion

of the earth equal to the ttmjtt^^ o^ ^"^ inch can be definitely recorded, I

am able to say that in Tokio there are very many small disturbances in

the ground, which are not registered with any of our ordinary seismo-

graphs.

    My object in recording these small motions is to see, first, whether

they are in any way connected with the larger motions which we call

earthquakes, just as the crackling of a stick is connected with its break-
ing and, second, whether there is any periodicity connected with these

                           ;

small movements, it being possible, for example, that influences which

produce the tides in the ocean may perhaps be sufiicient to produce earth
cracMes, whilst they may not (excepting where they are, so to speak,

like the last straw upon a camel's back) produce an earthquake.

     As Yokohama appears to be nearer to the origin of many of our

earthquakes than Tokio, and also because, as compared with Tokio, it

stands upon the rock, I have quite recently taken two of my tremor
instruments there. One of them has been placed in the hands of Mr. W.

H. Talbot, and the other with Mr. H. Pryer, these gentlemen having
 very kindly undertaken to keep a record of their movements.

IV. An endeavour to find out the relative extent of motions and variation

     in direction of an earthquake in passing over a limited area, the contour
     and geological structure of ivhich is irregular.

     To work out this problem I have distributed six similar seismometers

on the hills and in the valleys near my house. Since being established

only four earthquakes have been recorded. Until a number of shocks
have been felt I can hai'dly speak of what the result of this investigation
may be.

V. The carrying out of a long series of experiments on artificial earth-
                       q_iMhes in the alluvium of the Tolcio plane.

    These experiments were carried out jointly with my colleague Mr.

Thomas Gray.

These earthquakes were produced by allowing a heavy iron ball to

fall from various iieights up to 35 feet. The results obtained were as

follows :

   A1. partial determination, of the eifects of cuttings (like a deep

pond) and hills upon the transmission of vibrations. Small hills seemed

to produce but little effect in stopping transverse vibrations, but a pond

to a certain extent cut off both transverse and normal vibrations.

   A2. complete graphical separation of normal from transverse vibra-

tions.

    A3. determination of the relative amplitudes of normal and trans-

verse vibrations as observed at points differently situated with regard to

the origin of the shock. It appeared that although near to the origin

the amplitude of the normal vibrations was greater than that of the
transverse ones ; as we made observations at more distant stations these
normal motions diminished more rapidly than the latter. Roughly

speaking, the amplitude of the normal vibrations was inversely as the
distance from the origin of the shock. The transverse vibrations

diminished in amplitude more slowly.

     4. There appeared to be usually about six vibrations per second.
The normal vibrations were the more rapid.

     5. The average velocity of the normal vibrations was 438 feet per

second, whilst that of the transversal movements was only 357 feet.
     6. At a distant station (250 feet) four or five dissimilar vibrations

would be first recorded, and then the same four or five vibrations would
be repeated in the same order as first recorded. At times this cyclic-
like action was very distinct.

     7. The experimental determination (by bending and twisting) of the

elastic moduli, &c., of several common Japanese rocks. These experi-
ments were performed in conjunction with my colleague, Mr. Thomas

Gray, in the physical laboratory of the Imperial College of Engineering.

    In addition to the work which I have mentioned as being before me

for the coming seismic season, I shall endeavour to increase the stations
where time-observations have been made from two to three or four, at all
of which telegraphic signals can be received. I do this, firstly, because

I find from experience the important part taken by time-observations in

the interpretation of the best of our records                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and, secondly, because
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

they may perhaps be the means of showing us the true relations existing

between normal and transversal movements.
204 REPORT-- 1881.

     In conclusion I mnsfc remark that had I not, previously to the time
at which I received the grant of the British Association, been engaged

in recording earthquakes, and spent much time in experimenting with

various instruments, testing each with a long series of actual earth-
quakes (see ' Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan '),
I should not have been in the position to carry out the work which has
here been referred to.

     As I have established a small earthquake observatory, and have by
several years' experience determined upon instruments which appear to

me to be best suited for some of the more important seismological

investigations, have obtained and taught observers at various stations,

--and, lastly, have received the co-operation of several friends one of whom,
--Mr. W. H. Talbot, has also established a special observatory I sincerely

hope that the British Association will see fit to extend its previous grant
for the working out of seismic problems in a district which, amongst
all others, is one of the very best for carrying on such observations.

Ninth Report of the Conionittee, consisting of Professor Prestwich,

   Professor T. McK. Hughes, Pl-ofessor W. Boyd Dawkins, Professor
   T. Gr. BoNNEY, Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Dr. Deane, and Messrs. C.
   E. De Range, D. Mackintosh, R. H. Tiddeman, J. E. Lee, J. Plant,
   W. Pengelly, W. Molyneux, H. Gr. FoRDHAM, and W. Terrill,

   appointed for the purpose of recording the position, height above

   the sea, lithological characters, size, and origin of the Erratic
   Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland, reporting other matters
   of interest connected with the same, and taking measures for
   their preservation. Draivn up by the Rev. H. W. Crosskey,

    Secretary.

During the past year this Committee has pursued the researches entrusted

to it ; and is able to record the following additional instances of the

--occurrence of Erratic Blocks.
     Cumberland. Mr. T. A. Colfox furnishes the Committee with the

following particulars respecting granite and sandstone boulders found

while excavating for the new docks at Maryport, parish of Dearham,

Cumberland.

The granite boulders vary in size from small pebbles to a ton or

thereabouts in weight.

Those of the New Red Sandstone, which occur at a lower level, vary

from half a ton to two tons or more.

The granite boulders are rounded                                                                                                                                                  those from the New Red Sandstone
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

have sharp angles. No ruts, groovings, or other marks are visible.

The nearest granite occurs in the Kirkcudbrightshire hills on the

other side of the Solway, 15 or 20 miles distant, nearly due north ; the

New Red Sandstone is the stone of the district.

The granite specimens are numerous, but only four or five of the New

Red Sandstone ones have been found. The former were resting on the

top of a bed of sandy clay, underlying the sand and shingle of the fore-

shore, at a depth of 10 to 15 feet below the surface; the latter occur in
ON THE EERATIC BLOCKS OP ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 205

the bed of clay itself, 15 or 16 feet above the New Red Sandstone rock,

gimilar to the boulders themselves, which underlies the clay.
     The height of the group of granite boulders was 2 feet or 3 feet

heloiv low water at ordinary spring tides.

  --About three acres have been at present excavated.

     Yorkshire. In previous reports a description has been given of Shap

Granite Boulders, found in the neighbourhood of Filey.

    One of these Shap Granite Boulders has now been removed to the
University Museum, Oxford, and placed, with a descriptive inscription,

on the lawn in front.

It was found near the edge of the cliff about half a mile N. of the old

church, Filey, Yorkshire.

It measures 3 ft. 1 in. x 3 ft. 7 in. x 1 ft. 9 in., and is subangular or

rounded.

     It has apparently been moved, although nothing is known respecting

this point.

     Shap, near Penrith, the nearest place where a red porphyritic granite

of the same character is found, is 108 miles distant, bearing W.N.W.

from Filey.

The boulder described rested on Oolitic strata, at a height of about

150 feet above the sea.

  --Anglesea. Professor T. McK. Hughes draws the attention of the

Committee to a boulder which occurs near the centre of Anglesea. It is

chiefly interesting as having been by some considered an inscribed stone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but the supposed characters are entirely due to rock-structure.

It consists of bands of porphyritic hornblende diabase, occurring

along master joints    in  ordinary  hornblende  diabase                                     with  cross  joints
                                                                                          ;

tei'minated at the master joints, and having the appearance of runic

characters. It measures 7 ft. x 5 ft. 4 in. x 4 ft. 3 in. It occurs in a

field on E. of the railway opposite Cae Scynan, about f mile S. of

Llanerchymedd, Anglesea, and may have been derived from a dyke near

Gorphwysfa, about 7 miles distant.

    Attention has already been called to this boulder by the Rev. W.
Wynn Williams in the ' Archajologia Cambrensis.'

  --Leicestershire. Mr. J. Plant continues, as follows, his reports to. the

Committee on the erratic blocks of this county.

In the parish of Knighton, on the Clarendon Park Estate, Leicester,

are two boulders, the longest 5 ft. x 4-J- ft. X 3 ft. 9 in. ; the smallest 4ft. x
X3 ft. 1 in. 2 ft. 3 in. They are subangular and not known to have been

moved. They are derived from Mount Sorrel, W. of N. a few degrees,

7 miles distant. The two blocks are of granite, and lie close together at

a height of 300 feet above the sea-level, and were found under 8 feet

of mottled drift clay in digging out foundations of houses.

     In the parish of Stoughton, on the ' Dairy Farm,' near Leicester, are
two blocks of granite, the longest being 4 ft. x 3 ft. x 2^ ft. They are

subangular and not known to have been moved by man, and are derived
from Mount Sorrel, 9 miles N.W. They lie together on the surface, 360

feet above the sea-level.

     In the parish of Evington, on the Lodge Farm, Leicester, are three

blocks of granite, the longest 4| ft. x 2^ ft. x 1 ft ; the smallest, 3 ft. X
2^ ft. X 1 ft. ; they are subangular, and have been derived from Mount
Sorrel, 7 miles N.W. The three blocks lie close together on the surface,

360 feet above the sea-level.
206 REPORT-- 1881.

     In the parisli of Aylestone, Leicester, is a group of syenite boulders
the longest is 4 ft. X 3 ft. x l-|ft., and is rounded. It was derived from
Groby, 5 miles N.W., and lies exposed on the surface, 190 feet above the

sea-level.

   A number of boulders in this locality have been described in my

previous report, which are far below the height at which they must have

been originally deposited. They are now found lying in the alluvium of

the valley of the river Soar, having subsided to their present position as

the debris was washed away by floods from age to age.

    On the estate of Spinney Hills, at Lodge Farm, Leicester, is a group of

boulders of millstone gi-it and granite, the longest 3 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. x
1 ft. 9 in. ; the smallest, 2 ft. x 1 ft. x 1 ft. The largest block (millstone grit)
is very much rounded, the others (granite) are subangular and angular.
There are faint striaj on the millstone grit. The millstone grit may be derived
from Stanton, near Melbouriie,Derbyshire; the granites from Mount Sorrel.
The former is about 35 miles N.W. ; the latter G miles N.W. The granite
blocks are the most numerous. They are 320 feet above the sea-level.

     These boulders were in a deposit of stiff tenacious clay drift, 8 feet
deep, and were found lying upon the denuded surface of the rhastic beds,

which were uncovered in making a new road. The boulders are found on
the S.E. face of the hill, although they have ti'avelled from the N.W.

     In the parish of St. Margaret's, on the estate of Abbey Meadow,
Leicester, are three blocks of granite, the longest being 2 ft. x 2 ft. x 1 ft.
the smallest, 1^ ft. x 1 ft. x 1 ft. They are rounded and subangular, and
were derived from Mount Sorrel, G miles N. They were exposed in
excavating a new river-bed, and were found lying under 8 feet of coarse
pebbly drift (which forms an extensive deposit all over this area), at a
height of 165 feet above the sea-level.

     In the parish of Rothley, on the estate of Rothley Temple, Leicester,
is a group of four granite boulders, the longest 3 ft. x 2 ft. Gin. x 2ft.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the smallest, 2 ft. G in. x 2 ft. x 2 ft. They are subangular, and were
derived from Mount Sorrel, 2 miles due north. They lie exposed on

the surface, 280 feet above the sea-level.

    In the ]3arish of St. Mai^garet's, on the Great Northerir new line of
T'ailway, Willowbrook, Leicestei-, are four boulders, the longest 3 ft. x
2 ft. X 2 ft. ; the smallest 2 ft. x 2 ft. x 1 f t. 3 in. The millstone-grit blocks

are rounded ; the altered slate are angular, the granites sub-angular.

    The millstone grit may be derived from Stanton, Derbyshire ; the altered
slate from Swithland ; the granite fron Mount Sorrel. Stanton is 35 miles
N.W. ; Swithland 5 miles N.W. ; Mount Sorrel 6 miles N.

     These boulders were uncovered in excavations for the line of railway,
and were found at vai'ious depths in a drift composed almost entirely of

rounded pebbles, 175 feet above the sea-level. Numerous other erratics,

but of smaller dimensions, are found scattered throughout the mass.

The depth exposed at various points of this coarse pebbly drift varies
fi'om 10 to 20 feet, but as the solid rock was in no case reached, it must be
much deeper. This deposit must be of immense extent, it having been
found at various points over an area of 2 miles by \\ miles. The pebbles
constituting this pebbly drift are very much rounded and polished.

     In the parish of St. Maiy's, on the Victoria Park estate, Leicester, is
a widely extended group of boulders ; the longest 1^ ft. x 1 ft. X 1 ft.

the smallest cube of about 10 inches. Many of them are rounded, sub-

angular, and angular. They were derived from localities all -round this
          ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 207

county except the south side, extending from 6 to 60 miles, and from all
points of the compass except from the south.

     They comprise granites, syenites, slates, grits, sandstones, mountain

limestones, oolitic limestones, lias limestones, marl-stones, chalk-flints

coal and coal-shales, &c.

     The group is 290 feet above the sea-level and covers about 100 acres ; the
number counted was 500. They were turned out in an extensive system
of draining carried out over the whole area to a depth of 4i to 7 feet, in
widths varying from 1^ to 2 feet. All occur in drift, gravel, sand, and

clay. Many thousands of erratics must lie concealed under the remainder

of the area.

     The great ' Erratic,' called the ' Holy stone,' at Humberstone (briefly
alluded to in the Second Report for 1874, and more fully described in
the Sixth Report for 1878), one of the largest yet discovered in the mid-
land counties, is now entirely uncovered, and some fine photographs (on
a large scale) have been taken of it. The block is pentagonal in shape,
the sides are quite vertical, and are of the following dimensions in leno-th,

7 ft., 6 ft. 4 in., 5 ft., 5 ft. and 4 ft. 4 in. It may be observed that two of

the sides of 5 feet each are opposite to each other. The depth of the
sides is 5 feet. The longest axis is 10 feet, and the next in length (and

at right angles to it) is 9 feet.

     The vertical sides and corners of the block are as fresh as if recently
quarried, and no groovings can be seen upon them. The upper surface
(the longer axis of which lies N. and S.) has several deep irregular
grooves running N. and S., but these are considered to have been done
since the block was deposited, as it is thought, from reasons that cannot
be here entered upon, that it has been very much higher, and that a
considerable portion of the upper part has been worn away by natural
and artificial causes.

     The bottom of the block cannot be seen without turning it over, and
this would be a work of some labour. Careful calculation makes the
weight nearly 21 tons.

     The block rests on a denuded bed of the rhajtic formation, and the
material around it, which nearly covered it, is of recent accumulation,
so that originally it is thought to have stood quite exposed. The height
of the hill from which it is considered to have been brought is about 400
feet above the level of the sea, and is situated 6 miles N.W. The hill-
side on which the block now rests is about 240 feet above the sea, and
there is a river valley between these two points (at right angles to the
line of transit of the block) which is only 110 feet above the level of the

Bea.

     The proprietor, in obliging compliance with the request of the Com-

--mittee, will take measures for its preservation.
     Hertfordshire. Mr. H. George Fordham.P.G.S., presents the following
report on the Erratic Blocks of the parish of Ashwell.

          [Ordnance Maps-- 1-inch, Sheet 46. N.E., and 25-inch, Parisli Map.]
     The village of Ashwell lies in the middle of the parish, on the Chalk
Marl and the lowest beds of the Lower Chalk, at the foot of a ridge of Lower
Chalk hills, from which the river Cam, or Rhee, rises on the east side of the

village.

     To the north the parish is flat, consisting of Chalk Marl, through which
the river cuts a narrow channel, and it just reaches the Gault in its ex-
treme northern point, about 2| miles from the village.
--208 REPOET 1881.

      The village itself is about 160 ft. above sea-level (Bench-mark on

=church 162-5 ft.).-

      South and south-east of the village the ground rises rapidly into the

--ridge above referred to highest point, about half-a-mile fi-om the village
--(Clay Bush Hill), 329 ft. and this ridge runs S.E., at right angles to the

 main line of hills formed by the upper beds of the Chalk, constituting
 the edge of the London basin, until it joins this high ground near Kel-

 shall.

      The ridge near Ashwell bends away towards the north-west, and

 gradually loses its elevation. It forms the line of division between the
 valley of the Cam, or Rhee, and that of the Ivel, which latter stream
 flows into the Ouse.

      There do not appear to be any boulders on the flat ground north of
the village, nor on the low hills in other parts of the parish, and the only
locality for boulders within the parish seems to be the upper part of the
ridge of high ground already described. The whole of the higher part of
this ridge, within the parish, is covered with clays and gravels of glacial
origin ; and it is clear from the uneven appearance of the surface, that
the ground during long periods has been worked to obtain materials for
road-making and other purposes ; and to a small extent it is still so worked.

From this source, we may fairly assume, has been derived the large quan-
tity of pebbles and boulders which we now find in all parts of the village
of Ashwell. Indeed, at the present day, boulders are brought down from
time to time from the one gravel-pit now open.

      The boulders and pebbles, of which the following is a catalogue, and
which are found in different parts of the village, must be therefore
considered as belonging to the ridge above the village, from which there
is every reason to suppose they have all, at one time or another, been
obtained, from a height of from 270 ft. to 329 ft. above the sea.

     The catalogue includes all the larger blocks, and such smaller ones as
appear to be representative in point of material, or of any interest from

 external characteristics.

     The measurements and descriptions of external appearances are from

my own observations ; for descriptions of the rocks I am indebted to
Professor Bonney, to whom specimens have been submitted. He writes

that, as they reached him when away for some time from books and
collections, he has not attempted to name the few and generally im-
perfectly preserved or exposed fossils which he has noticed.

218 REPOET-- 1881.

  --Denhighshire. The Committee have received the following communi-

--cation from Mr. D. Mackintosh, F.G.S. :

     I lately found a large boulder of Eskdale granite 164 feet above the

highest level of the parent rock in situ. It lay amidst many millstone

grit boulders on the summit of the mountain ridge south of Miners,
Denbighshire, at a height of about 1,450 feet above the sea.

  --Height above the Sea of Erratic Ghalk-Jlints. I lately found many

chalk-flints associated with pebbles of Eskdale granite, &c., more than
1,100 feet above the sea on the E. side of the mountain south of Minera.

Mr. John Aitken has lately informed me that he found univorJced as well

as worked chalk-flints more than 1,000 feet above the sea on the western
side of the Pennine hills. It is well known that chalk-flints occur in the
drift on Moel Tryfan in North Wales up to a great altitude. During late
visits to the mountain I found them as high up as 1,350 feet above the
sea, or about 350 feet higher than the chalk in situ in Ireland. That the
chalk-flints were transported by ice, and that they are not the insoluble
residue of chalk which once existed in situ, is evident from the extent to
which they are intimately associated with undoubted erratic stones, and
from their not being associated with insoluble silicified chalk fossils.
It is at the same time very difficult to conceive of chalk itself having once
extended over an area so large as that which is more or less strewn with
flints without leaving patches in protected situations.

  --Passage of Boulders through Gaps. Many large boulders from the Arenig

IMountains have found their way through the gap in the Minera moun-
tain range which is traversed by the road leading from Mountain Lodge
(W. of Ruabon), to the World's End (N, of Llangollen.)

     The Committee earnestly repeat their request for the assistance of
local observers to enable them to catalogue the rapidly disappearing

AErratic Blocks of the country with as much completeness as possible.

large part of the most interesting specimens are especially liable either
to be destroyed as nuisances on the land, or utilised as building materials ;
and unless especial attention be paid to them during the next few years,
no accurate record of their position and character will remain.

Second Report of the. Committee, consisting of Professor A. Leith

   Adams, the Eev. Professor Haughton, Professor Boyd Dawkins,
   and Dr. John Evans, appointed for the purpose of exploring the

    Caves of the South of Ireland.

Be]port on the Caves and Kitchen-middens near Gappagh, Go. Waterford, by
                                                R. J. USSHER.

Since the explorations reported to the British Association last year,

made in a cave at Carrigagower near Middleton, in company with Mr.
J. J. Smyth, of Rathcoursey, I had the pleasure of excavating in his

     ' In and E. of that gap they are strewn in a manner more easily explained by
floating ice than land ice, as it is more difficult to conceive of land ice (after passing
through the gap), continuing its course in a narrow stream for several miles in an
easterly direction, than it is to conceive of floating ice doing the same.
ON THE EXPLORATION OP THE CAVES OF THE SOUTH OF IRELAND. 219

company a spot on the townland of Ballylionock, not far from Castle
Martyr, in the Co. Cork, where in a piece of rocky uncultivated ground

we found a kitchen-midden containing hones of domesticated animals,

charcoal, sea-shells, a quern stone, sharpening stones, and several other

relics of man. Beneath the above, or mixed with them, we found a
number of human bones, both of adults and young children (there were

six or eight of the latter), apparently the remains of bodies that had
been entire when deposited there. Previous to our excavations there had

been discovered at the same spot one of the dumbbell-shaped stones,

cupped at each end, that have been found in other places in Ireland. It

is now in the Cork Institute.

     I also excavated the kitchen-midden of a rath at Bewley, in the

Co. Waterford, where I found, among charcoal, slag, burned stones and
numerous broken bones of ox, goat, Vg> horse, and red deer, a quantity
of broken pieces of hand-made pottery of rude make, full of quartz
grains and representing a number of vessels of considerable size, charrfd
and burned sometimes internally and sometimes externally. This pottery
was all broken, and generally in a most friable condition. Shells of the
fresh-water mussel were also found in this refuse-heap, and a human

metacarpal or metatarsal bone ; but the most remarkable object I naet
with there was a rude stone hatchet formed from a waterworn flattish
stone, adapted for the purpose by breaking it across and chipping its

broad broken extremity to an edge, two deep indentations being also

made at opposite sides, evidently to hold a ligature or attachment for a

handle.

Continuing my researches along the scarp where the bone-cave of

Ballynamintra is situated, I found in and around the mouth of a small

cave on the townland of Ballynameelah another kitchen-midden with

bones of the usual domestic animals and red deer, charcoal, slag, flint-

chips, sea-shells, some pieces of iron, pieces of a jet bracelet, a fine ring

of bronze, probably an ear-ring, portion of a bone comb of a type to be

described, a carved bone whorl, and a number of whetstones.

In the month of May last I commenced operations in a rath situated

on a high rocky knoll that forms the scarp opposite to that containing

the bone cave. This rock is called Carrigmurish, or the Eock of Maurice.

A tradition exists that a highwayman named Maurice Conway lived there,

who was put to death on the rock for his crimes. The rath consists of a

ring fence in a ruinous condition, and contained a depression flanked

on one side by a rock that appeared hollow beneath. This hollow I

found at once to contain the kitchen-midden of the rath, and now that

it is excavated to the depth of some thirty feet it is shown to have filled

a cave, descending  at  an  angle  of 50° or so, of considerable  size,   This

                                                                         _

cavity was choked with earth and stones containing large quantities of

charcoal, bones, and other relics. The larger bones were almost all

broken, to extract the marrow. The animals represented were a small

breed of oxen (the foreheads of which were broken in), pigs, goats, asses,

red deer, and in a few instances dogs, cats, and domestic fowl. Some of

the canine bones were of large size. Pieces of the antlers of red deer

were plentiful. These were generally cut in lengths with a saw, the cuts

being made at both sides and the piece then broken off. Several articles
of antler were found, marling- spikes or piercers, pins, whorls, and beads.

An interesting series of narrow scoops occurred, one class of which are

made of the tibise of goats and another of those of fowl. Pins of the
220 EErORT-- 1881.

latter bones were also plentiful, but wanted the polish observable on
those made of antler, which were more carefully finished and had either

a notched groove, an eye, or a head otherwise carved for attachment by a

string. Of the bone articles there are several combs with teeth on both

sides, whose middle portion is formed of three plates of bone fastened

Atogether with rivets of bone and in one instance of iron.                                                                                                                          knife-handle

of antler, polished and ornamented with small circles, held an iron blade,

Asome of which remains.  portion of a large polished jet bracelet, as well

as of a smaller one, was also fotind, and two bits of coloured iridescent

glass.

   A bronze pin and other objects of bronze were also found.

Iron objects were numerous, especially small curved knife-blades

thick at the back. There is one long slender knife or poniard, a spear-

head eleven inches long, and the head of a smaller spear, a series of

slender rods and pins of iron, two of the latter with iron rings attached

to them, large-headed iron nails, a rude buckle, a portion of a crucible

or helmet, and the share of a wooden plough with wood adhering. One

of the most interesting objects of iron is a small saw with the end curved
up like that of a skate. This is inserted in a wooden back, which doubt-

less served as the handle, and explains why the pieces of antler Avere not

cut through, as would be done by a modern saw-blade.

Stone objects were also numerous                                                                                                                                                    a quern, a round mace or hammer-
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

head with a hole for inserting a handle, spindle- whorls, a small stone

bead, a large assortment of whetstones, one of which was beautifully cut

and pierced by a hole for attachment, burnishing stones, globular and

disc-shaped pebbles, which probably served as sling-stones, and one of

which has a cross cut on it, also a number of marine pebbles, probably

selected for their colouring, and crystals. With these sea-pebbles may be

mentioned shells of oysters, limpets, whelks, cockles, scallops, and other

marine molluscs. Slabs of sandstone, and in some cases of silurian rock,

foreign to the locality, frequently occurred, arranged evidently for hearths,

at different levels in the cavity, which doubtless became buried under sub-

sequent debris.

   A large amount of the kitchen-midden is believed to remain un-

disturbed, probably quite as much as the excavated material. At a depth
of more than twenty feet the cavity was found to extend very much and
not to be filled with earth. On exploring the open part with lights, large

chambers were discovered, from one of which by a steep descent we
made our way into the extensive system of galleries shown in the accom-

panying plan, which has been dialled and laid out by Mr. Duflfin, County

Surveyor, who has given me the most valuable assistance. The dialling

shows the directions and lengths of the chambers and galleries already

known, but time did not allow of making a detailed survey. When the

Rdialling was laid out on the surface it was found that the point is

very near the face of the scarp, and that persons within the cave could

here communicate by sounds with those without. Here a convenient

entrance can be made into the caverns. On the surface of the different

galleries were found broken bones of domestic animals similar to those

in the kitchen-midden, as well as charcoal. As a rule a stalagmite floor

extends throughout, exhibiting in places large pillars, domes, cones,

dammed-up pools of clear water, and similar phenomena. This stalag-

mite floor rests on a deposit of cave-earth several feet in depth, which it

is desirable to excavate and remove to daylight for thorough examination,

considering the interesting remains discovered in the adjoining cavern.
This work will, however, be a matter of great labour, and require con-

siderable time.

     The excavation of the kitchen-midden above described was difficult,
owing to the depth from which the large amount of material had to be
lifted, in a box or buckets, by means of a pulley, windlass, and other

plant.

     The grant of 101. made in 1879 has been expended, as well as a great
pai-t of another grant of 50Z. made by the Royal Irish Academy. To
thoroughly explore all the galleries would cost a very large sum, but if
the British Association were to grant us a sum of 501. we could make a
good commencement, quite sufficient to show what the fauna of the cave-
earth may have been.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir F. J. BkamwElL, Dr.

   A. W. Williamson, Professor Sir William Thomson, Mr. St.
   John Vincent Day, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. C. W. ]\Ierrifield,

    Dr. Neilson Hancock, Mr. Abel, Captain Douglas G-alton,
   Mr. E. H. Carbutt, Mr. Macrory, JMr. H. Trueman Wood,

   Mr. W. H. Barlow, and Mr. A. T. Atchison, axjpointed for the
   purpose of ivatching and reporting to the Council on Patent

     Legislation.

The Bill of this Sessiou, 1881, by Mr. Anderson, Mr. Brown, Mr Hinde

Palmer, and ISh-. Broadbnrst, was read and considered.
     This Bill, which as it stands is a mere sketch, and not likely to prove

a working piece of legislation, is identical with the Bill introduced last
year by the same gentlemen, and referred to in the last Report (JB. A.
Reioort, 1880, p. 318) of this Committee. It was, however, read a second

time in the House of Commons and consequently reached a further stage

than in 1880.

     The Bill proposes the appointment of a Chief Commissioner and
assistants. It would reduce the fees considerably, that on application to

10s. and on sealing to IZ. It extends the period of provisional protection

to twelve months. It gives a patentee power to add (apparently by way

of supplement) to his original patent.

     The Committee certainly approve the proposal to appoint paid Com-
missioners. They think the proposed reduction in fees much too large.
They approve the principle of letting a patentee amend his patent, but
it would be necessary that proper provision should be made. The clause
in the Bill would be quite unworkable.

     The Committee have also to report that a carefully prepared Bill has
been published by the Council of the Society of Ai-ts for discussion, with
the view of its being introduced into Parliament next year.

     The principal alterations in the law which would be made by the
Society of Arts' Bill are shown in the following memorandum, ^which

--appeared in the Journal of the Society for August 12, 1881 :
     Commissioners of Patents. The Patent-office would be removed from
under the charge of the present Commissioners, who are the Lord

Chancellor, the Master of the Rolls, and the Law Officers. Three Com-

missioners would be appointed on account of their special knowledge.

  -- --Application for Letters Patent. Metlwd of granting same. The method
--of application for a patent would be somewhat as follows : The applicant

would file a provisional specification, which would be referred to examiners
appointed for the purpose. They would see that the invention was

proper subject-matter for a patent ; that the specification fairly described

the invention, and that it was generally intelligible and properly drawn.
They would not inquire into novelty or utility. They would report, and
their report would be shown to the applicant before being seen by the
Commissioners. The applicant would then have an opportunity of con-
ferring with the examiners as to any required alterations. Provisional
protection would be granted immediately on receipt of the application,
and would last for nine months. Before the end of that time the appli-
cant would be required to file a complete specification, fully describing
his invention. This would be referred to the examiners, and treated in
the same manner as the provisional specification. The appHcant would
be enabled to amend his specification in accordance with the recom-
mendation of the examiners, and on his doing so a patent would be
2
224 KKPORT-- 1881.

   --Ohligato)'y Licenses. The Bill would compel a patentee to grant

licenses in cases where it could be clearly shown that the invention was
not being worked in such a way as to supply the reasonable wants of the
public ; but the clause has been so worded as to prevent any improper
interference with the rights of the patentee over what is considered to be

--his own private property.
      Trial of Patent Cases. The Bill would provide for the trial of patent
cases in an entirely new manner. They would be tried, in the first
instance, before one of the Commissioners, and an appeal would lie to the
whole body. The Commissionere would have power to call in assessors,
and would have such other powers as would enable them to try the cases
fully. It is hoped that this would greatly simplify the patent litigation,
and would prevent the enormous expense which is now incurred by having
to bring complicated questions of law and fact before a jury, who are

probably ignorant of the scientific or mechanical considerations involved.

It may be noted that one great source of expense is the preparation of

models, which are only necessary to illustrate mechanical questions to
persons unaccustomed to deal with such questions. For experts in such
matters, drawings would be sufficient ; indeed, an engineer would generally

much prefer proper drawings to any model of a machine.

   --Antidpation. It is proposed that a mere publication more than thirty

years old, unaccompanied by use within the thirty years, should not be
considered sufficient to invalidate a patent. The object of this is to

remove the hardship, which now not infrequently occurs, of a patent being

invalidated, or a patentee being put to great expense in order to prove
his claim, by the discovery of some ancient and probably incomplete

description, a description which in many cases could not have been put
into operation at the time it was made for want of necessary appliances to

--carry it into effect.
      Patents to Foreigners. It is proposed that patents should be granted
to foreigners, or persons resident abi'oad, on precisely the same terms as

those on which they are granted to British subjects resident in the
United Kingdom. At present patents are granted to British subjects
in respect of communications from abroad ; that is to say, the theory is,
a person travelling abroad sees a useful invention, brings it home, and
patents it in England, such person not being, in any sense, the inventor.
In jiractice, patents for communications from abroad are nearly always
taken out by patent agents, whoso clients arc resident out of the country,
and the patent, as soon as it is taken out, is assigned to the real foreign
inventor. Cases of injustice have occurred through the action of this

system, in which a patent has been granted to a person who had no moral
right to it, but who anticipated the original inventor in obtaining the

English patent.

  --Effect of Foreign Patents on English Patents. At present an English

patent lapses at the expiration of any foreign patent taken out by the
same inventor for the same invention. It is proposed in the Bill that

English patents should not in any way be affected by foreign patents.
    The Committee request that they may be re-appointed, in order to

watch the progress of this Bill through Parliament, as well as that of

any other Bill for the amendment of the Patent Law which may be

introduced.

    The Committee have not expended any of the sum of 51. placed at

their disposal last year, but they would be glad to have the grant

renewed.
       HBPOBT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.  225

Report of the Anthropometric Gorrhmittee, consisting of JMr. F.

   Galton, Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Brabrook {Secretary and Reporter),

Sir Gr. Campbell, Dr. Farr, Mr. F. P. P^ellows, Major-G-eneral

PiTT-EiVERS, Mr. J. Park Harrison, Mr. James Heywood, Mr.

P. Hallett, Professor Leone Levi, Dr. F. A. Mahomed, Dr.

MuiRHEAD, Sir Rawson Rawson, Mr. Charles Egberts, and

the late Professor Rolleston.

                                   [Plates III. and IV.]

--1. The Committee were first appointed in 1875, and instructed to

continue the collection of observations on the systematic examination of

heights, weights, &c., of human beings in the British Empire, and the
publication of photographs of the typical races of the empire. It may be

convenient to recapitulate briefly what the Committee have done in

previous years.

  --2. In the first year they prepared schedules and instructions and

had them printed, and purchased a small outfit of instruments to send
to places where measurements were to be made. The co-operation of

inspectors of the army, of the navy, of factories, and of pauper schools

was secured.

  --3. In the second year the Committee obtained a series of measure-

ments of the 2nd Royal Surrey Militia from Colonel Lane Fox (now

General Pitt-Rivers) and circulated copies of his report as a model for
other observers. They further revised the instructions, prepared a book

of lithographed patterns of hair colours, added to the collections of
instruments for lending, and initiated the work of collecting typical

photographs.

  --4. In the third year the collection of statistics was actively pro-

ceeded with, and returns were obtained of a few well-defined classes, as

boys in Westminster school, letter-sorters in the Post Office, criminals, &c.
Tables were prepared from these, and a Report by Mr. Galton on the

returns of criminals was printed and circulated. Progress was made in

the collection of photographs.

  --5. In the fourth year the Committee continued the collection and

tabulation of observations. They had by that time obtained statistics of

about 12,000 individuals, which were sufficiently complete to justify the
publication of tables of average height and weight, and of the ratio of

weight to height. They had been furnished by the Warden of Christ's
Hospital with the records in his possession which enabled Sir Rawson

Rawson, one of the members, to construct a series of tables, serving as a
model for similar observations. Mr. Roberts prepared for the Committee

a series of tables and charts, showing the relation of height and weight

in the several classes of the English population, as compared with the

observations of Americans and Belgians published by Drs. Bowditch,

--Baxter, and Quetelet respectively.
     6. In the fifth year the Committee were able to double the number

of observations, and to reduce them to order by adopting a scheme of
classification. They selected from the returns those which related to a

standard class living under the most favourable conditions witb respect

to fresh air, exercise, and wholesome and sufficient food, and prepared
a series of tables relating to that class. They also digested the returns
relating to the colour of hair and eyes in the standard class, and sum-

marised the statistics of height and weight from persons of country

 origin and town origin respectively. They availed themselves of the
 observations made during several years at Marlborough College to show

--the usefulness of such systematic records.
      7. In the present year, the sixth of their existence, the Committee have
 not carried on operations under favourable circumstances. The returns

obtained in relation to the several classes are now of sufficient number
to make it desii'able to subject them to scientific ari'angement by skilled

computers, but the small fund at the disposal of the Committee (30/.)
has not been sufficient to enable this to bo done comjiletely.

   --8. The same cause has prevented the incurring any expense in

grants towards actual observations, which, as they involve skill and care

and time, ought, in many cases, to be paid for. The whole of the returns

--collected during the year have been due to obliging voluntary assistance.
      9. -The Committee think it an important part of their duties to show

how observations should be made, and how they should be used when
obtained. From this point of view, they are inclined to hope that their

--labours have been very successful.
     10. It is confidently anticipated that many ot tlic persons who have

been furnished with the forms and instructions adopted by tlie Committee,

and to whom these reports arc accessible, Avill proceed with the collection

and recording of observations on the definite system laid down, and that,
by this means, valuable results will be obtained and made available even
after the Committee have ceased operations.

   --11. This remark applies particularly to the case of the public and other

schools and institutions which have furnished information to the Com-
mittee, as recorded in the present and previous reports. In each of these
it is hoped that the practice of keeping an anthropometric record will be

continued.

  --12. On page 3 is a statement of the additional returns Avhich have

been furnished to the Committee during the present year.

  --13. The special thanks of the Committee are due to the contributors,

mentioned in the list, whose zealous assistance in a matter necessarily
involving a great expenditure of time and trouble deserves most hearty
acknowledgment.

  --14. Adding these returns to those referred to in the previous reports,

--the aggi'egate number of original observations fui'nished to the Committee

is as follows :

REPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.                                                                                                                                                        229

     1(5, Mr. Roberts has rendered his colleagues very essential help by
the preparation of the diagrams and a great nnmber of the elaborate
tables in the forn\er Reports of the Committee, and has contributed to the

present Report the paper on the general result of the observations, which

--is given in the Appendix.
     17. Mr. Roberts's Tables (I.-IV.) shovf the general result of the
observations collected by the Committee as to (1) height, (2) weight, (3)

--chest-girth, (4) strength.
     18. The height of 38,953 persons is recorded in Table I., the hori-
zontal black lines in which indicate the curve of growth formed by the
' mean ' height at each age, which is 3 feet 5 inches at the age of 5, and

becomes 5 feet 8 inches at the age of 50.

    19. The weight (with clothes, for which about 7 lbs. may be allowed)

of 26,560 persons is recorded in Table II. The horizontal black lines in
this Table indicate the curve of increase in weight formed by the ' mean

weight at each age, which is 4 st. 9 lbs. at the age of 10, and becomes

--11 St. 81 lbs. at the age of 70.
     20. The chest-girth of 17,883 persons is recorded in Table III., the
horizontal black lines in which indicate the curve of increase formed by
the ' mean ' chest-girth at each age, which is 26 inches at the age of 10,

and becomes 36^ inches at the age of 40.

  --21. The strength, as indicated by the drawing power of the arm, in

5,039 persons is recorded in Table IV., the horizontal black lines in which

indicate the curve formed by the variations of the ' mean ' drawing power

at the successive ages, rising from 35 lbs. at age 11 to 80 lbs. at

ages 25-30, and falling again to 70 lbs. at the age of 50.
     22. In using Mr. Roberts's tables, however, it is important to bear

in mind that he employs the term ' mean ' not in the ordinary sense of an
arithmetical mean or average, but as representing ' the value at which the

largest number of observations occur,' or that of ' greatest frequency.'
The arithmetical average is found by him in adults to exceed the 'mean'

in general by about half an inch.

  --23. In Tables V. and VI. Mr. Roberts is able to show the results

of a comparison as to the ' average ' height and weight of the several

classes of the population, distinguished as (1), the professional classes,

including town and country                                                                                                                             (2), the  commercial classes in towns;  (3),
                                                                                                                                                    ;

--the labouring classes in the country ; (4), the artisans in towns.
     24. Table V. relates to height, which is taken without shoes. The

relative position of the four classes stands in the order stated ; classes 1

and 2 being taller, and classes 3 and 4 shorter, than the general popula-

tion. This relation is maintained throughout, and the table affords

material for study as to the comparative effects of occupation and town

--and country life on growth.
     25. Table VI. relates to weight, which is taken with clothes. The
relative position of the four classes still stands nearly in the same order,

class 1 being heavier and class 4 lighter than the general population, but
class 3 very nearly coincides with the general average, and is in general

superior in weight to class 2. In other words, the rural occupation of

the country labourer gives him the advantage in weight over the town

tradesman, though the latter has the advantage in height.

  --26. Class V. of the classification adopted by the Committee in the
--Report for 1880 the industrial workers or sedentary trades in towns

and Class VI., the specially- selected occupations, have not f\irnishfd

returns in suflBcient niiwber tn be available for cpptiparison.
--230 KEPORT ]881.

   --27. The chairman of the Committee, Mr. Francis Galton, conti'ibutes

to the Appendix to this Report a paper on the range in height, -weight,

and strengtli of the different classes at every age. He measures the
range, not between the maximum and minimum valufes recorded, which

afford no safe basis for comparison, but through an extension of the
principle by which the so-called ' probable error ' is ascertained. Thus,
he first arranges the cases in the order of their magnitude, then he
cuts off a certain fractional portion of them from either end of the series,

and measures the difference between the maximum and minimum of the

intermediate group. The ranges given are between the upper and the
lower tenths and between the upper and the lower fourths, the value of

the latter range being identical with twice the ' probable error.'

  --28. Inspector- General Lawson contributes to the Appendix to this

Report a valuable paper giving the results of the earlier portion of the
observations furnished to the Committee on eyesight.

   --29. The total number of observations of eyesight collected by the

Committee has been 2,956 ; many of which, as will be seen by Dr. Law-

son's paper, are not considered ti'ustworthy. Sufficient, however, have

now been derived from various independent sources to form a fair average.

   --30. This inquiry as to eyesight has led the Committee to consider

the very important question of colour-blindness, which has been ascer-

tained in Germany and America to affect 1 in 25 of the male population,
and which probably exists in this country to a greater extent than is

--suspected by most people.
     31. To facilitate the collection of statistics relating to colour-blind-
ness, the Committee accepted an offer which a member, Mr. Roberts,
was enabled by the kindness of the Norwegian professor, Daae, to make,

that he should prepare for publication an English edition of that profes-

sor's tests for colour-blindness, as published in Berlin ; also a description
of Professor Holmgren's method, with a revised series of the eyesight

--tests and popular instructions of his own.
     32. This work has been published in a compact form,' audits applica-
tion might even be made a parlour pastime, since it requires no special

qualification in the observer, who may indeed be a colour-blind person him-
 self. The Committee hope that this little book may be widely circulated

 and freely used. This book of teats is in use at Marlborough College,
and Mr. Roberts conti'ibutes to the Appendix of this report an analysis of
the observations made on the whole of the boys and masters, 600 in
number, at present in the College, by the Rev. T. A. Preston, a gentleman

to whom the Committee arc indebted for many valuable contributions to

 their store of anthropometric observations.

   --33. Mr. Roberts has remarked on this important subject that ' some

 unnecessary alarm will be felt by travellers if they are led to believe that

colour-blindness is as prevalent among engine-drivers as other men of
 their own class, and that one person in every twenty-five is subject to
 this defect. As a matter of fact, the severer forms of colour-blindness

 are quickly eliminated from the railway services, either by the conscious

 inability of the men to distinguish the signals to which they are daily

 and almost hourly subjected, or by the minor accidents they fall into,
 which leads their employers to dismiss them as careless, incompetent, or
 intemperate servants. It is, however, most desirable that this clumsy and

     ' The Detection of Colmir-hlindness and Imperfect Eyesight. By Mr. Charles

   oberts, F.R.C.S. Published, at .5.t., bj' Mr. P.ogue, ^ St. Martin's Place, W.C.
EErORT OF THE ANTIIBOPOMETUIC COMMITTEE.  . 231

 dangerous process of elimination should be superseded by a searching,
 trustworthy method of testing the colour-sense, especially in fresh candi-
 dates for employment on railways and steam-vessels, and it is a disgrace

--to our country which was the first to discover and investigate the sub-
--ject of colour-blindness and to point out its dangers that it should bo

 the last to recognise its practical importance. But the subject has a
 much wider bearing than the regulation of traffic by sea and land. As
many arts and occupations can only be carried on successfully by persons
who possess a normal colour-sense, the testing of the eyesight, whether
for colours or objects, should take place in childhood, and before a youtli
has wasted much time in acquiring technical knowledge which his faulty
sight precludes him from using to the same advantage as his more fortu-

nate competitors. Every parent shsuld be cognisant of the condition of

the colour-sense of his children, in order that he may provide the colour-

blind ones with suitable occupations. Fortunately the art of testing the
colour-sense is a very simple one, and is quite within the capacity of a

schoolmaster or parent of ordinary intelligence, as it requires neither a

knowledge of the theory of colour-blindness (which, indeed, is not yet

agreed on by specialists) nor of medicine or surgery.'

   --34. Upon the portion of the reference to them which relates to the

* publication of photographs of the typical races of the Empire,' the Com-
mittee have not at present anything to add to previous reports. It was
intended that a portion of the grant made to the Committee should
be applied towai-ds this branch of their work, but the more urgent needs
of the general anthropometric work have absorbed the whole of it.
Dr. Beddoe, however, has presented a set of photographs of pure High-
landers, and a collection of Irish types has been made by Mr. Park

Harrison.

   --35. The total expenditure of the Committee during their six years'

operations has been only 243L 15s., or about 40Z. a year. This has in-

cluded the preparing, printing, and circulating of many thousands of

papers of instructions, forms of returns, cards and other publications, and
of a costly series of colour-types ; besides the judicious payment of small
sums, in a few cases, as remuneration to the observers, where their posi-

tion in life (as regimental sergeants &c.) rendered it desirable ; the
purchase of photographs and negatives of photographs and of several sets

of instruments for making measurements, and the cost of clerical labour
in abstracting the returns. The Committee venture to think that they

have not improvidently administered the fund at its disposal.

   --36. The Committee could, indeed, not have accomplished the work

at so small a cost but for the obliging exertions of some of the members,

notably Sir Rawson W. Rawson and Mr. Roberts. They have also to

acknowledge the services of several gentlemen, not members of the

--Association, who have kindly consented to act as advisers to the Committee,

viz. : Dr. Bain, Dr. Balfour, Inspector-General Lawson, Dr. Waller

--Lewis, and Dr. Ogle.
     37. It remains to note briefly the work still to be done by the Com-

--mittee in the event of their reappointment.
     38. First, it is exceedingly desirable that more complete details
should be obtained with regard to the earlier ages from birth to 10 years,
a period in which the rate of growth and development is probably more
affected by external circumstances than in after-life, and which therefore
lends itself more readily to classification.
--232 REPORT 1881.

  --39. Secondly, it is of great importance to proceed with the inquiry

into anthropometric facts relating to females, which has been commenced
with much zeal by the mistresses of some of the high schools for girls,

and which by their example may be extended among the various classes

of girls' schools throughout the kingdom.

  --40. Thirdly, a larger number of statistics are required of individuals
-- --belonging to class V. town industrial workers to form an average for
--comparison with the other classes.

     41. Fourthly, further observations should be obtained on the colour

sense and on eyesight.

  --42. Fifthly, the materials already existing should be more completely

worked out, especially those referring to the colour of hair and eyes, as

well as the physical proportions of the population in different geographical

districts, or districts inhabited by persons of different racial origin.

  --43. Lastly, the encouragement in public and private schools and es-

tablishments of systematic weighing and measuring on fixed principles

should be continued.

   --44. The Committee have, in conclusion, to state that the assistant-

secretary, Mr. J. Henry Young, has performed his duties with marked
intelligence and zeal.
                BEPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.                                                          233

                           APPENDIX.

    Mr. C. Roberts, ivho has prepared the Tables from I. to VII. for the

--Committee, has contributed the following explanations and remarJcs :

Tables I. (height), II. (weight), III. (chest-girth), and IV. (strength),

are intended to show the chief physical characters of the British race

hence the whole number of observations are given to show the range or

variation of the stature, weight, &c., at each age, and the relative number

of individuals  at   each  height,  weight,  &c.                                       the mean height,  chest-girth,
                                                                 ;

weight, and strength being indicated by the horizontal lines crossing the

columns of figures where the largest number of observations occur.

     Tables V. and VI. show the average stature and weight of different

--classes of the nation, classes which have been differentiated by social or

sanitary surroundings and peculiar occupations.

     It is necessary to call attention to the difference between the average

and the mean as employed in these tables. An average is obtained by

dividing the sum of the values observed by the number of observations,

while the mean is the value at which the largest number of observations

occur (' the value of greatest frequency.') An average is influenced by

exceptional cases, but a mean disregards exceptional cases and is entirely

dependent  on   the  predominating  numbers                                            hence  I  have  employed  the
                                                                                    ;

mean to distinguish the racial type, and the average the variations to

which the race is subject by the modifying influences of local and excep-

tional causes. To determine the racial type of a nation by means of an

average it would be necessary to have all classes of the community

represented in their due proportions ; but the unequal distribution of

occupations renders this impossible, unless a general census were taken.

Even within narrow limits it is almost impossible to obtain observations

of all the individuals of a class, as the taller and better-developed members

readily submit to measurement, while the shorter and imperfectly- de-

veloped evade examination, and the sick and deformed are passed over

altogether. On the other hand, the determination of the racial type by

the mean is free from these sources of error, as we disregard both the ill-

developed and the over-developed individuals, and depend entirely on

those which represent the medium development of the class or nation.
Table VII., giving the stature of adult men of different classes of the

British population shows the difference between the average and the

mean. In those classes, where all the individuals have been accessible
and no selection has been attempted, the average and the mean stature

are almost identical ; but in the case of the recruits for the army, where

all the men below a certain standard are excluded, the average is an inch

higher than the mean stature. The average in this case implies that

recruits are of the same type as the agricultural classes (Class III.), but
the mean shows that they are really of the type of the town artisan

class (Class IV.) from which we know they are chiefly drawn. This
also explains why the average stature of the general population (Table V.)

J8 half an inch higher than the mean stature (Treble I.)
                                     --

--234 EEPORT 1881.

    The tables show some new and interesting facts in connection with
the iDhysical development of the body at different periods of life. Below

the age of ten years the observations are very imperfect, but from that
age up to sixty years they are very numerous, and fairly representative of
all classes of the population.

     The accompanying chart (PI. III.) shows graphically the variations in
the mean height, chest-girth, weight, and strength of the general population
with advancing age, and the relation of these qualities to each other and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

      The increase of stature throughout life as shown by Tables I. and V.
is a new and unexpected fact, but it is obviously due to the survival of
 the taller and better developed members of the population, and the elimina-

tion by disease or death of the smaller and feebler ones. Quetelet has

stated that man attains his maximum height at the age of 30 years and

maintains it up to 50 years, after which it begins to recede, and at 90 it

has lost three inches. This may be true of individuals if measured from

year to year, but it does not appear to be true of the population in the

iiggregate. The loss of stature resulting from the degeneration and loss
of tissues, and the stooping position assumed by old people, is more than

counterbal9,nced by the survival of a greater number of individuals who
are above the average in height. The uniform increase in the weight and

chest-girth throughout adult life also confirms this view.

     The Tables do not show distinctly at what period man attains his full
stature, and much difference of opinion exists on this subject. Some

French writers (Barnard, Allaire, &c.) maintain that growth in height
goes on until the 32nd or 3oth year, and Dr. Baxter arrives at the same

conclusion from the statistics of the United States Army while most
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

English writers (Danson, Aitken, Roberts, &c.) regard the 25th as the
year of mature growth, and Dr. Beddoe places it as early at the 23rd

year, admitting, however, that a slight increase may take place after this
age. The difference of opinion on this subject arises, no doubt, from the
faulty method of relying on the measurements of many dififerent indivi-

duals, instead of measuring the same individuals from year to year until
growth ceases. The elimination of the weak and ill-developed by death,
the difficulty of following the same class, and all the members of the class,
through successive years, and the selection of special classes (i.e. recruits,
whose ages are never certain), invalidate all conclusions as to the period

of maturity, drawn from statistics of measurements of many different

persons ; but, allowing for these sources of error and judging by the run
of the curves formed by the means and averages in Tables I. and V.,
it is probable that little actual growth takes place after the age of 21,
and that it entirely ceases by the 25th year. It is evident, moreovei',
from Table V., that the full stature is attained earlier in the well-fed
and most favoured class (Class I.) than in the ill-fed and least favoured
classes of the community.

REPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.

     The following is a copy of the drawing- and instructions issued by the Committee

to observers in collecting statistics of strength :

     The above figure represents the position in which the strength of arm should be
tested. The right or left arm, whichever is the stronger, should be used to draw,
and the other to resist. The resisting arm must be free, and extended straight from
the side, as nearly as possible in the line of the shoulders, and the hand of the other
arm brought back towards the ear, as an archer uses a bow.

REPORT OF THE ANTIIROPOMETEIC COMMITTEE.

'Mv. Francis Galton vjJio has prepared the Tahles VIII. to X. on the Range
   in Height, Weight, and Strength, has contributed the following remarks

   upon them.
     In determining the range I have employed and extended the method

by which the so-called ' probable error ' is found. That is to say, the
observations in each series were arranged in the order of their respective

Amagnitudes, beginning with the lowest and ending with the highest.

definite fraction was then cut off from either end of the series ; the values
at tbe exact points where the divisions took place were ascertained by
interpolation, and the diiference between these gave the range of the in-

termediate portion.

   --The fractions so cut ofE were (1) a half; this gave simply the median

value : (2) a quarter ; this gave the upper and lower ' quartile ' values,
and consequently the ' interquartile ' range (which is equal to twice the
' probable error ') : (3) a tenth ; this gave the upper and lower ' decile '
values, and consequently the ' iuterdecile ' range. The following are the
definitions of these terms, Median, Quartile, and Decile :

     The Median, in height, weight, or any other attribute, is the value
which is exceeded by one-half of an infinitely large group, and which the

other half falls short of.

     The Ujjper Quartile is that which is exceeded by one-fourth part of an
infinitely large group, and which the remaining three-fourths fall short

of. Conversely for the Loiver Quartile.

     The Upper Decile is that which is exceeded by one-tenth of an in-
finitely large group, and which the remaining nine-tenths fall short of.
The Lower Decile is the converse of this ; one-tenth falls short of it, and

nine-tenths exceed it.

     Each line of the annexed tables is to be read as in the following
instance, taken from the fourth line of Table Villa.

   --Example: 869 observations were made of boys of the professional

classes, of 13 yeai-s of age, whence it appears that
     (1) There are as many boys above the height of 59-0 inches as below

it. This Median value differs from the Average value by 0-1 inch,
which shows a trifling want of symmetry in the distribution of the

heights.

      (2) One-fonrth of the boys exceeds the height of 60-9 inches, and

another fourth falls short of 57-1 inches; in consequence, the difference
 of 3-8 inches defines the range in height of the intermediate two-fourths,

 or middle half, of the boys.

      (3) One-tenth of them exceeds 62-8 inches, while another tenth falls
 short of S-S-'i inches. The difference between these numbers is 7"4, which
 defines the range in height of the intermediate eight-tenths, or three-

 quarters of the boys.

      (4) The highest measurement actually taken in these 869 observa-
 tions was 71-5 inches (reckoning to the nearest inch), and the lowest was

 similarly 49-5 inches, showing a diffei'ence of 22 inches.
      Tiic information as to the extreme values that happen to have been

 observed in these 869 cases, is avowedly of little solid value. Their
 magnitude depends to a great degree upon the accident of this particular
 series happening to include, or not to include, one very excejjtional
 instance of great stature and another of small stature. It is beyond the
 power of statistical science to determine the extreme values that might

 possibly be observed.
246 BEroRT-- 1881.

     On the other hand, the Median, Decile, and Qaai'tile values possess a

 trustworthiness of the same order as that of the Average or Ai'ithmetic
 Mean values. They are not sensibly affected by a solitary accident, and
 a moderately large series of observations is sufficient to determine them

with as much precision as is needful for ordinary statistical purposes.

    A small error in the position of the medians, quartiles, &c., causes an

 error in their values proportional to the tangent of the circumscribing curve

at the corresponding points. On protracting the curves for height, weight,

 and strength from their tabular values, it appears that the tangents at

 the quartiles are but little greater than those at the medians, but that the

 tangents at the deciles are about twice as great. Again, the tangents at

corresponding points in two of these curves, drawn from different num-

bers of observations (the ordinates relating to the successive values being
supposed in all cases to stand at the same distances apart), must vary

inversely as the number of observations. Consequently, in order to as-
certain decile values in the series with which we are now dealing, with
the same accuracy as medians and quartiles, we require to have about
twice the number of observations.

     It appears to be well worth while to print, not only summary tables of

results, as Table VIII. for the height, and Table IX. for the weight, but
to supplement these by other tables going more into detail and referring

to the classes separately. So much has been written on the applicability
of the Exponential Law of Error to statistical results, that it is important
to publish material for the more complete discussion of the subject. Into

the discussion itself, this is hardly the place to enter, further than by
saying that the median values will be found to conform very closely in-
deed with the arithmetical means, that the distribution of variations on
either side of the median value is so symmetrical that the difference be-
tween either quartile or decile and the median is almost exactly one-half
of the difference between the two quartiles or the two deciles, and, lastly,
that the range between the two deciles is very commonly a trifle short
of double the range between the two quartiles. According to the Ex-

ponential Law of Error, the results in every case would have been nearly

the same as these.

     I would refer those who desire to pursue the subject on a theoretical

basis to a paper of my own on the ' Geometric Mean in Vital and Social

Statistics,' in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, October, 1879, and
more especially to the subsequent one by Dr. Donald McAlister on the

' Law of the Geometric Mean,' in which the equation is given to the cir-
cumscribing curve, both on the assumption of the arithmetical mean of

two fallible observations of the same fact being the most probable inference
from them, and on that of the Geometric Mean being accepted, as I have
argued that it ought to be, as the more probable inference in all physiolo-
gical phenomena.

On the Calculation of Deciles, Quartiles, and Medians.

     The deciles, quartiles, and medians are ordinates to an ideal curve,

--supposed to be constructed as follows : An infinite number of measure-

ments, belonging to the same statistical group, are arranged in the order

of their magnitudes, and ordinates of lengths corresponding I'espectively

to each of them are erected side by side, at equal, but infinitesimally

ABsmall, distances apart, along a given line  ; then the curve passing

through their tops is the curve in question. The median is the ordinate

corresponding to the abscissa of i'AB ; the lower and upper quai'tiles
            REPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.                                                        247

correspond  respectively  to :^'AB and  to |"AB                                           tlie  lower and  upper
                                                                                       ;

ABdeciles correspond to j^y  and to ~^^ AB. It may be remarked that

the general shape of the cnrve will always resemble that shown in the

diagram, owing to the recognised statistical fact that medium values are

much more frequent than extreme ones, deviations from the mean value

becoming increasingly rare in a rapidly increasing ratio.

In order to deduce approximately the above-mentioned curve from a

ABfinite series of n observations, we divide  into n equal spaces, and

erect an ordinate in the middle of each of a length proportionate to the

corresponding datum. The spaces will be defined by divisions that run

+from 0° at A, to ii° at B, and therefore there will be ti I of them.

The first ordinate will stand at 0°*5 of the graduated scale, the second at

1°'5, and so on, while the abscissae of the deciles, quartiles, and medians

hwill be at the following positions : to> l» ?' > t^- The data are grouped

248 REPORT-- 1881.

To work out this case, take a base line AB, divide it iuto twelve

equal pai'ts, and erect an ordinate (see the dark lines in tLe diagram) in

the middle of each of them. The first ordinate will reach to 50 inches

(the lower part of the ordinate is suppressed to save space) the next
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

three will reach to 51 inches; the nest four to 52 inches, and so on

according to the tabular data. Erect ordinates of suitable heights (see

the light lines in the diagram) at each of the graduations, and draw

horizontal lines through the top of each group of dark lines until it

Ameets the light lines on either side of them.    figure is thus produced

Awhich consists of a series of rectangles rising in equal steps.   curved

line (see the dotted line) which smooths off the corners of the rectangles,

is the curve upon which the deciles, &c., are to be measured, and the

broken line formed by joining the central points of the upper boundary

of each rectangle may be adopted as an equivalent to the curve without

material error. Tl^e ordinates at these central points are those that cor-

respond to the successive integral heights of 50, 51, 52, &c. inches. The

value of their corresponding abscissas is equal to half the number of the

dark lines in the rectangle in question ]}lus the number of dark lines in

all the previous rectangles. An inspection of the figure will show this

more readily tiian a verbal explanatioii.

     The calculation is very easily made by appending to the tabular data

Ain and B three other columns, C, D, and E. Column C contains in

each line the sum of all the heights inferior to the number of inches
A Dfound in upon the same line.
                                 contains the halves of the entries in

B, and E contains the sura of the entries in and D, and consequently

gives the abscisste corresponding to the several integral inches.

Example : to find the lower decile in the above instance. As we know

the abscissa of the decile, we proceed to find from column E the two entries

between which it lies, and we take the corresponding ordinates from A,

whence we find the decile itself by simple interpolation. As there are

twelve observations in the example, the abscissa of the decile is 1-2,

which lies between the tabular entries in B of O'S and 2'5, and these are

the abscissiB of 50 and 51 inches respectively. Therefore the decile is

equal to 50 inches plus a certain fraction of an inch, x, whose value may

be ascertained by a simple rule of three. Thus :

difierence between 2-5 and 05 : 1 inch :: difference between 1-2 and

                                               0'5 : X inches

a;=0-35, and the required decile=50'35 inches.

     On a first glance at the tables, a very remarkable fact is manifest. It

is the uniformity of range at all the ages given in it. Let us begin with
height, as shown in Table VIII. ; the range between the upper and lower
fourths is as great at ] 1, or even at 8, years of age as it is at 22 or 40

years, and at the intermediate ages it is much the same, viz., about 3'3

inches. It might have been expected that the range would vary with the
average height, so that the fact of boys of 11 years of age having a
median or average height of 53"5 inches, and an interquartile range of

3*2 inches, would imply that men of 22 years, having a median height of

Q7'Q inches, would have an interquartile range of 4'4 inches, because
53'6 : 3-2 ::67"6 : 4'4. The interdecile range is equally constant. It seems

so difficult to conceive of variation otherwise than as a fraction of the
                                                                                                                 ;

          REPORT OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC COMMITTEE.                                                     240

average height, that we are justified in expressing the steadiness of the

range°at different ages by the phrase that the variation in height at
all ages between boyhood and manhood is inversely proportional to the
average height at those ages. The results of 100 measurements of newly-

born male infants at their full term, furnished to me by Mr. Roberts, show

a large range ; the median value is 19 2, the interquartile range is 1-8, and

the interdecile range is o'S ; but it must be recollected that it is difficult

to measure infants with accuracy.

     It would be of much interest to examine this question further, and to

find out at what age the range begins to be steady, but my data are at
present insufficient to enable me to do this.

    As regards weight, much the same holds good at and after the age of
14, but the range decreases steadily as we go farther back. Among the

newly-born infants the median value is 7-6 lbs., the interquartile range

is 17 lbs., and the interdecile range is So lbs.
    As regards strength the range is small in early life, large in early

manhood,"but in after-life other 'conditions appear which materially and
steadily reduce it. The upper quartile values begin to decrease and the

lower quartiles to increase ; in other words, the stronger quarter of English-

men do not keep up their full, vigour, and the weaker quarter become

steadily stronger. This latter event is certainly due in large part to the

previous removal of many of the weakest by early death. As regards the
deciles we see that the athletes preserve their vigour very fairly, while the

weakly tenth considerably improve, so that the interdecile range also

decreases in advancing life.
     Another very curious fact is a marked increase of range of height

from about 14 to 16 years of age in Classes I. and II., and in a less degree

in Class lY., which disappears afterwards. Probably the increase of
range takes place in different boys at slightly different ages, and therefore

becomes smoothed down in the mean result. If so, it would be still more
striking if the classes had been further subdivided. I gather from this

temporaryy increase of range that precocity is, on the whole, of no

advantage in later life, and that it may be a disadvantage. It is certain

that the precocious portion do not maintain their lead to the full extent

it is possible that they may actually fall back, and that many of those

who occupied a low place in the statistical series between the ages of

14 and 16 occupy a high place after those years. The full discussion

of  this  requires  the  collation of many  individual  histories                                     it cannot  be
                                                                                                   ;

effected through mean results. Perhaps the class of statistical researches
in anthropometry that most deserves encouragement at the present time

is the preservation of these records of the same individual throughout

life. He might with little trouble be measured and weighed annually or

more often, in the nursery, at school, at college, and in after-life, and

all the records might be kept seriatim in a book, with remarks at the

Aside accounting, as far as may be, for abnormalities of growth.                                      large

collection of well-kept records of this kind would be of the highest value,

not only from an anthropometric but from a sanitary point of view, using

that term in its widest sense.

Inspector- General Lawson, who has prepared the Tables XI. to XIV, on

             Eyesight, has contributed the folloiving remarks upon them.

     The acnteness of vision lias beer* tested by finding the distance at
which the individual under trial could distinguish the dots on the cards
issued by the Committee, so as to count them readily. These cards
contain eighteen square dots of one-fifth of an inch wide placed iri'egu-
larly in two groups, the distances from centre to centre of the contiguous

dots varying from 2 diameters to 316 ; their intervals may accordingly be
taken at one diameter less, or from 1 to 2 '16. Of these intervals five are

of 1 diameter, six of 1'24, two of 1-83, and three of 216, and, if the
acuteness of vision were fairly tested, it must have been equal to sepa-
rating the dots with the intervals of one diameter sufficiently, at the
distance noted for each individual, to enable him to count them.

    On approaching such a card, from a distance, the dots with the larger

interspaces become distinct, while those with the smaller still seem con-

tinuous ; but after a few trials many of those under test will become
aware that the elongated-looking dots are made up of two, though they

be too far ofi" for the eye to separate them.

     The individuals examined have been distributed i]i five classes ac-
cording to the scheme detailed in Table 111. of the Committee's Report
for 1880 ; the details for each class are given in the Tables XI. to XIV.

On looking over these the fluctuations in the distance for consecutive

years of age are far too great to admit of any satisfactory conclusions;
to obviate this the ages have been grouped in five -yearly periods up to
thirty, after which ten-yearly periods have been employed ; these reduce

the fluctuations materially and afi"ord much more harmonious results, as

will be seen in the following abstract.

     Distance at which the test-dots were distinguished at different ages
in each of the five classes, with a general mean for the II. 111. IV. and
V. Classes, and a separate one for the IV. and V. Classes.

Ages
--

--262 KEPORT 1881.

 · The details in this table show that the distance at which the dots
could be counted by those under 25 years of age in Class I. was about
half that found for each of the other four classes, while above 25 this
difference was greatly reduced. This discrepancy has arisen from the
persons in Class I. having been examined in a hall where the space was
limited and the light not very good ; but it is so great as to prevent the
numbers for the first class being combined with those for the other four
in a general mean ; consequently the latter only, which are sufiiciently
regular among themselves to justify the proceeding, have been employed
for this purpose, and the results are given in the 6th column of the
table. From this it appears that, in a mixed town and country popula-
tion of 974, those from 15 to 19 could distinguish the test-dots at a mean
distance of 53'7 feet; this diminished through 51"7 feet between 20 and
24, to 50'0 feet from 30 to 39 ; a decrease of 2 feet in ten years went on
from 40 to 59 ; and after 60 this was nearly doubled. There is here
an approximate measure of the reduction of the range of vision with
advancing age, which, taking the distance the dots were visible from

15 to 19 as the unit, may be represented for the subsequent ages as

follow :

Ages  ..         15-   20-  25-  30-  40-  60-  60-

Kange of vision   1   -96   -93  -93  -89  -86  -74

The influence of town or country occupations and surroundings may
now be examined. Class III. may be taken to represent the latter, but

it is advisable to combine Classes IV. and V., to increase the number as

well as to embrace a greater variety of occupations, to illustrate the
former. The results are given in the last column in the above, table.
Class II. includes persons in a difi'erent sphere of life from III., IV.,
and v., and their numbers are too few at present to afford a suflBcient
basis to work on ; while Class I., as has been already mentioned, is not

available. Taking the mean distance at which the dots were distinguished

at 15 to 19 as the unit as above, the ranges at subsequent ages were as

follow :

--clusions.
     Note. The conditions under which the acuteness of vision is tested
have a marked influence on the results. The most favourable circum-
stances for bringing out the acuteness of vision in persons whose eyes
are healthy, and their refracting power normal, are to view a dark body
against a well-illuminated bright- coloured background some way behind
it. For short distances the upright or wire of an iron fence ; for greater
distances a pole or flagstaff projected against the clear sky beyond, are
suitable objects, from either of which the distance of tbe observer can
be measured. The writer, for instance, though his vision is no longer
so acute as formerly, can perceive distinctly at 200 yards' distance, in
good daylight, the upright of an iron hurdle presenting a breadth of
0'36 inch from his point of observation, and projected against a newly
gravelled walk ; and, some years ago, he had frequent opportunities of
observing a flagstaff, on a hill, the smallest part of which was not more
than six inches in diameter, yet in favourable weather that was distinctly
visible three miles off. The angle the object subtended at the eye in the
fonner instance is 10"'3, and in the latter Q"'7, and in each case it was

considerably within the extreme limit of vision. Tt will be observed,
however, that though these objects were narrow, they were of consider-
able length, and this extension in a direction perpendicular to their
smallest diameter enabled the eye to seize and retain the latter, while,

had its length not exceeded its breadth there would have been far more
difiiculty in finding it in the first instance, and in keeping the eye fixed
steadily on it afterwards. In practice objects which appear square or
circular, as presented to the eye, cannot be distinguished under such

small angles, and only become distinctly visible at distances proportion-

ately much shorter. When they are dark, on a light ground in the same

plane, the range of vision is reduced still more.
     In arranging his test-types Snellen proceeded on the assumption

that the normal eye could perceive an object subtending an angle of 1',

and consequently he gave the lines forming his letters such a breadth

that they should reach the eye under an angle of 1', when held at the
distance indicated in the accompanying instructions ; but to admit of
the various parts of the letters being perceptible their height was fixed

at 5', or five times the breadth of their limbs. These letters afford a very

convenient practical test of the various alterations the sight may have

undergone ; but, as will appear immediately, owing to their forms and
the small distance between their different parts, they are not adapted
for determining quantitatively its greatest range under normal conditions.
The test-dots which were introduced originally to ascertain the fitness of

recruits for military service seem better suited for this purpose, though,

as they were employed to ensure the minimum range of vision required

for military service, which is far within that of the ordinary healthy eye,

their capabilities were never fully considered or developed.

    A single test- dot, say a square of ^ of an inch of a side, will be

visible as far as any combination of them in which the single dots are
distinguishable ; their arrangement in groups is merely to provide a
check on the person under trial, by varying the number exposed and
requiring him to count them but when investigating the extreme limit

                                                                                                                                                              ;

recruits only were concerned, viz., the distance at which dots of the

same size appear separate to the eye, and can be counted, varies with the

space between them. Four rows of dots of ^-inch square were placed

on a card ; those of the first row were separated from each other by

spaces of the same size left blank ; in the second row each dot was

separated  from  those  in  its  vicinity  by  f  of  an  inch                        in the  third  row
                                                                                   ;

the distance of each dot from any other was f of an inch, and in the

fourth row f of an inch ; and a single dot was placed on one side 1'5
inch from the nearest one in the rows. These were exposed in the open

air, on a bright day, in a situation affording a clear range of about

90 feet ; at that distance from the card the single dot was quite percep-
tible, and those in the first, second, and thii-d rows had the appearance of

continued lines. On approaching the card the dots in the fourth row

could be counted at 82 feet, those in the third at 74, in the second at

58, and in the first only at 36 feet. The ordinary cards of dots, therefore,

on which these are separated by spaces vai-ying from one to a little over

two diameters can only give a comparative test of the acnteness of vision

among those examined, and not an absolute one such as a card with

intervals of not less than five times the diameter of the dots between

every two of them would afi'ord. Dots so arranged could not be grouped

readily, but they could be shown in varying numbers to the person under

trial, and his replies would indicate whether he were able to distinguish

them.

Mr. Roberts's Rejiort on the Observations on Eyesight and Colour-blindness
             made at Marlborough College by the Rev. T. A. Preston.

    The diificulty experienced by many observers of obtaining suflicient

space and light for testing the eyesight by the test-dots (which are
distinguishable to the normal eye in good daylight at a distance of 19
yards) has induced the Committee to use Snellen's test-types, No. 1 and
No. 10, as more convenient and trustworthy. No. 1 is a small type
visible to the normal eye at the ordinary reading distance of from 12 to
20 inches, and No. 10 is a large thick type ith of an inch square, dis-

tinguishable by the normal eye at a distance of 10 feet.
     The Rev. T. A. Preston, one of the masters at Marlborough College,

has examined the eyesight and colour-sense of the whole of the boys and
some of the masters at present in the College, and the following is an
analysis of his returns. The observations include the age, the colour of
the iris, the eyesight as tested by No. 1 and No. 10, and the letters
composed of horizontal and vertical lines for astigmatism ; and the
colour-sense as tested by the methods of Dr. Daae and Professor Holm-
gren (and in a few instances by the solar spectrum), according to the
book of tests wliich I have prepared for the use of the Committee (' The
Detection of Colour-blindness and Imperfect Eyesight ' : Bogue).

10-11 feet, and a minor one at 2-3 feet. This latter curve is due to the
accession after the age of 13 years of an abnormal amount of imperfect
eyesight (short-sight and over-sight) which is too slight relatively to the
total number of observations to influence the averages. 39'4 per cent.
possess normal distant vision, while 30'1 per cent, are above, and 80'5

--per cent, below the average.
     Astigmatism. Tested by means of the letters composed of horizontal
and vertical lines, 682 per cent, of the Marlborough boys and masters are
returned as more or less astigmatic, or in the propoi'tion of nearly two to
one; the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical defect being 1 to 1*2.
Mr. Preston is not quite satisfied with the result of his observations on
this subject, as he had no means of checking the statements of the boys.

  --Ignorance of the Names of Colours. In a recent report on the

examination of 27,927 school-children for colour-blindness by Dr. Joy
Jeffries, in America, the following remark on this subject occurs : ' Ex-

perience has abundantly shown me that but very few hoys of the grammar or

higher schools are familiar with colour-names of even the primary colours,
and that still less can they correctly apply those names they do remember

when shown coloured objects. Although jirepared for this ignorance on
the part of the boys to a certain extent, I confess I was astonished to find

it so frequent and great. It seems almost impossible that a bright boy of

fourteen, not colour-blind, should not know the word green or be able to

apply it. Tet this does not give an extreme idea of the truth in reference

to the iojnorance of colour-names and their application among school-
boys.' Being desii'ous to know if our English public school-boys are as
ignorant of coloiir-names and their application as the boys of the same class

in America, I submitted the above sentence to JSIr. Pi-eston, and the
following is his reply : ' I cannot agree with Dr. Jeffries as to ignorance

of colour-names. By this I mean reds, greens, &c. Of course mauve,

magenta, &c., and what are called drapers' colours are not often known,

but I have certainly had no difficulty in getting the names of the common
colours. In fact it was quite the exception to meet with a boy who could
not tell the names fairly well. The whole of the boys who proved to be
colour-blind, except one, knew of their defect, and another boy was under

the impression that he was colour-blind, but turned out on examinatioii
not to be so.'

Rejjort of the Gonnmittee, consisting of Professor Leone Levi,
    Mr. Stephen Bourne, Mr. Bkittain, Dr. Hancock, Professor
    Jevons, and Mr. F. P. Fellows, appointed for the purpose of
   inquiring into and reporting on the present Appropriation of
    Wages, and other sources of income, and considering hotv far it

    is consonant ivith the economic progress of the people of the

    United Kingdom. Drawn upj by Professor Leone Levi.

If it were possible to ascertain, with any approach to accuracy, the present
appropriation of wages and other sources of income of the people of the
United Kingdom, it would certainly be of the greatest utility, as it would
afford a valuable aid in the consideration of some of those great problems
which meet us on every side in our social economy. There ai-e, in truth,
       ON THE PRESENT APPROPRIATION OF WAGES, ETC.  273

110 means for ascertaining either the absolute income or the true expen-
diture of the entire population, and any calculation of the same must,
more or less, partake of the nature of an estimate. But even an estimate

may be helpful, if founded on proper bases. Given certain data with re-
spect to a limited number of cases, it is quite possible, by legitimate induc-

tion, to arrive at great results as applied to the whole population. Only
let the data which form the bases of the calculation be certain and well
established, and the result must be a close approximate to the real truth.

What are all calculations regarding the expectation of life, but generalisa-

tions from certain given facts ? The Northampton Tab^e, upon which so
many millions have been insured, was constructed by Dr. Price on the
account kept at Northampton during the years 1735-1780, of the ages at
death of only 4,689 persons who were buried in the parish of All Saints.
It is not only, however, in matters of life and death that we observe a

wonderful unifoi*mity, certainty, and constancy. "We find the Law of

Nature operating alike on all men, influencing their moral and intellec-
tual qualities, regulating their will, and controlling their habits and

manners. And it is the beauty and glory of the statistical method, that
it enables us to calculate the seemingly incalculable. With this instru-
ment at hand, and with a good grip of the teaching of common experience,

that which appears but a dream or a guess to the uninitiated, becomes to
the mathematician and statistician a simple, natural, and reliable result.

     Apart, however, from the difficulties attending any genei'al inquiry of

this nature, there are special obstacles to the ascertainment of the appro-

priation of wages and other income, in that there is a want of agreement

--in the scientific meaning of the word income, in that it is not easy

to distinguish the gross from the net income, and the income of the nation

collectively from the income of the individuals composing it. Many
attempts have been made to estimate the total income of the nation of late

years. Mr. Gladstone, in one of his addresses, estimated it at 1,000,000,000Z.

The late Mr. Dudley Baxter, in his work on National Income, gave
it at 813,000, OOOZ. The writer made an estimate of the wages and earnings
of the working classes in money or its equivalent, and found them to
amount to 418,000,000/., and Mr. Gifien,.in a, paper read before the Statis-

tical Society, estimated the recent accumulations of capital in the United

Kingdom at the rate of 240,000, OOOf. per annum. More might have been

expected from the labours of the International Statistical Congress in this

direction. That Congress, at its session at the Hague in 1869, expressed

a wish that the delegates of different countries, and especially the heads

of their statistical offices, should communicate to the future Congress the

elements which the statistics of their countries supply for arriving at a>

statistical account, as complete as possible, of the income of the nation,,
whether according to the individual method, which implies a valuation of

the individual income of the people, or according to the real method, that
is, by a valuation of the diSerent branches of production. But this
desideratum has not yet been supplied.

       Pecson-al and National ' Income.

The a.scertained or ascertainable income in the United Kingdom is

that assessed to income tax on the declaration of the tax-payers, or upon

other incontestable evidence. The unascertained and unascertainable

is the amount of income not charged with that tax, which includes

all incomes undei* 150Z. a year, and probably many incomes up to, and

exceeding that amount, though not sufficiently regular or certain, or

income tax.

    What is done with such annual income ? How much of it is pro-

is set aside as capital for reproduction ? Is, in short, the method of its
appropriation consonant with the economic progress of the people of the
United Kingdom ? It is not an easy matter to say what amount of
national income is productively expended. Productive consumption, said
Mr. John Stuart Mill, is what is consumed by productive labourers, in-
cluding the labour of direction as well as of execution, in ]i;eeping up or
improving their health, strength, and capacity for work. Unproductive
consumption is what is expended on pleasure or luxuries, whether by the
idle or the industrious. That alone, according to Mr. Mill, is productive
consumption which goes to maintain and increase the productive power
of the community. But there is labour the end of which is not produc-
tion but enjoyment, and yet the expenditure for which, within certain

limits, may be perfectly consistent with the greatest efficiency of labour.

Not all luxuries, not all enjoyments, are waste in a true economic sense.
The human forces, unlike the physical, need rest and renovation, and
whatever is expended for the purpose of giving it a fresh impetus for

labour, may well be held to be productive expenditure. Any attempt,

moreover, to determine wliether the expenditure is productive or unpro-
ductive, by the character of the article for which the expenditure is
incurred, as by its chemical composition, or nutritive value, would lead
us to problems which lie beyond the province of the economist or statis-
tician. The consumption of the people is greatly regulated by climate
and temperature, by the constitution and habits of the people, and by the
nature of their occupation. It is experience, not theory, that must guide
us in the determination of the possibilities or impossibilities of certain
economies.

                                    Distribution of Expenditure.

     The principal items of expenditure of a personal character are food
and drink, house rent, furniture, fire and light, clothing, tobacco, educa-
tion, literature, science and art, church and charity, servants, horses and
carriages, and amusements. In calculating the expenditure for articles
of food and drink and for clothing, a distinction must be made between
the gross expenditure, which includes the expense of distribution and
taxation, and the net expenditure, which represents the simple cost of the
articles, whether imported or produced at home. Twenty per cent, has
been added for the cost of distribution to represent retail prices, that rate
not being too high remembering that between the importers and con-
sumers there arc always two and often thi*ee profits. The Co-operative
Companies have in some cases led to the economy of one at least of
these profits, but tlieir dealings are not of sufficient magnitude to afiect
materially the calculation for the expenditure of the whole nation.

                                                    Population.

     The population of the United Kingdom has been ascertained by the
census of 1881 to be 35,246,562, of which we may estimate 17,000,000
males and 18,000,000 females, and as it afiects some of our future calcula-

tions, it is well to remember that the urban population may be taken at

20,000,000 and the rural at 15,000,000. The details as to ages are not
yet known, but in a general manner 55 per cent, are adults and 45 per

cent, persons under age.

                 Abticles of Food.
                           Bread.

     In the expenditure for food, bread liolds the first place, on account of
its being shared in by the largest number of people, though in amount it
stands second to meat. Mr. Caird, in his valuable work on the landed

interest, calculated the quantity and value of wheat of home and foreign
growth consumed annually in the United Kingdom as follows :

                  Quantity                           Value

Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, in a paper read before the Statistical Society
on the 11th May, 1880, gave the consumption of wheat for the average of
three years, from 1876 to 1878, as follows :

     ....Home               Quantities available  .       Value
     ....Foreign              for consumption     .
      ....Total                                              £

                  23,898,639 . . .                   £58,027,340

Take 60,000,OOOZ. as the average of the two authorities, and add 25 per
cent, for manufacture of bread and distribution, and the cost appears to
be about 75,000,000/. In another form, take 110,000,000 cwt. as the
consumption, or 12,820,000,000 lbs. ; at 80 lbs. flour per cwt. wheat,
they will give 9,856,000,000 lbs. flour. Assume that 280 lbs. flour will

give 316,610,000 quartern loaves, at Gd. the quartern loaf the gross
expenditui'e would be 77,500,000/., whilst the net expenditure would be
60,000,000/. ; the gross expenditure being at the rate of 1'41(/. , and the
net at the rate of l"12c?. per day for each individual in the kingdom.

                                                                 Potatoes.

     ISText to bi-ead, the potato is most largely used as farinaceous food,

especially in Ireland. The home growth of potatoes was estimated by Mr.

Caird at 111,000,000 cwts. According to the agricultural statistics for

1880, the number of acres under cultivation in the United Kingdom was

1,380,578 acres. Estimating the produce at 3 tons per acre, the total
produce would be 82,835,000 cwts., and, at 6s. per cwt., the cost would be '

24,850,000/. Add 9,750,000 cwts. imported, at an average price of 5'84a'.
per cwt., value 2,847,000/., we have a total of 27,607,000/., and, with

20 per cent, for distribution, 33,238,000/., or in the proportion of 0'64c/.
as the gross, and 0'51d. as the net expenditure per day for each in-

dividual.

                                                               Vegetailes.

     Of the quantity of vegetable and fruit home-produce consumed there

is no account, but the amount may be safely taken at half the value of

net expenditure per day per person.

                                           Meat.

The amount expended in meat is very large. Mr. Caird calculated

the value of meat produced at home, in butcher's meat, bacon, ham,

pork, &c., at 24,500,000 cwts., valued at 87,000,000/. And he added

6,300,000 cwts. of foreign growth, valued at 22,050,000/., making in all

We109,050,000/.   may test the consumption of meat by another process.

"We are indebted to the kindness of Mr. N. Stephen, the Clerk and

Superintendent of the London Central Meat Market, for the quantity of

meat there sold, which, in 1880, was 221,448 tons.' Add for meat

slaughtered by butchers 20,200 tons, and we have a total of 241,674

tons, or 541,349,760 lbs., as representing approximately the quantity of

meat consumed in the Metropolis. Take the population of what is called

Greater London, which the Central Market supplies, at 4,760,000, and

the consumption per head is 0'31 lbs. per day. The average wholesale

price may be taken at Q\d. per lb., and the average retail price at 7\d.

per lb. At the latter price, the amount spent in London alone, on meat,

is 16,900,000/. Extend the calculation to the whole country at ^-Ib. per

head, and at the same prices of Q\d. and T^d. per lb. respectively the re-

sult is a total consumption of 3,193,750,000" lbs., at a cost of 83,000,000/.

wholesale price, and 99,800,000/. retail, which give an average expendi-

ture of 1"87(7. as a gross, and l"55c/. as a net expenditure per day for

each individual.

                                           Fish.

     The consumption of fish is considerable. Mr. Spencer Walpole, the

Inspector of Fisheines, in a report to the Secretary of State, stated that

in 1879, 135,000 tons of fish were brought, for consumption, into London
and that, upon a population of 3,500,000, it gave an average of 90 lbs.
per head. Fish is largely consumed by the labouring classes but London

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

is exceptionally well supplied with fish, and for the whole population it
is not safe to take more than 20 lbs. per head per annum. The price of
fish varies considerably with the description and season of the year
salmon, soles, and turbot selling at considerably higher prices than
herrings, mackerel, cod, and other kinds. Taking the total quantity
consumed at 700,000,000 Ibs.,^ and the average pi'ice at 4(7. per lb.

' The proportions were as follows :

                                                          107,326

- The quantity of fish conveyed by railway from each of the principal fishing

ports, in the year 1878, was as follows :

                                                     Tons

England                                              176,652

Scotland                                             32,292

Ireland                                              6,894

                                                                                                          216,338

equal to 484,597,120 lbs. Allowing one-third more for fish consumed direct from the
boats, the consumption would be 646,000,000 lbs.
278 EBPOET-- 1881.

wliolesale and bd. per lb. retail, the total value would be 11,700,000Z. wbole-
sale and 14,500,000?. retail, or in the proportion of 0-26d. as a gross, and
0'2Bd. as a net expenditure per day per person.

                                          Sutter and Cheese.

     Butter and cheese are important articles of food. Mr. Caird estimated

the home produce of these at 3,000,000 cwts., valued at 13,500,000/., and
at a similar quantity and amount the butter and cheese imported. In
1880, however, the imports were 2,326,000 cwts. butter, and 1,775,000

cwts. cheese, of the collective value of 17,232, OOOL, making, with the

home produce, a total of about 30,000,000?., and, with 20 per cent, for

distribution, a total of 36,000,000Z., or in the proportion of 0'67(Z. as a
gross, and 0'56d. as a net expenditure per day per person.

                                            3IilJc and Eggs.

     The value of home-grown milk is estimated at 26,000,000?., and the
value of eggs imported in 1880 at 2,300,000?., representing, probably,
one-fourth of the total consumption, or 9,000,000?., giving an aggregate
in milk and eggs of 35,000,000?., which, with 20 per cent, for distribution,
amounts to 42,000,000?., or equal to 0-78d. as a gross, and 0-66d. as a net
expenditure per day per person.

Fruit and other Articles of Import.

To these we must add the following articles of import, at their

declared value, viz. :  Fruit,  raw  and  dry,  6,507,000?. ;  I'ice,  1,697,000?.
                                                                                                                     ;

spices, 506,000?. ; and confectionery, 568,000?. Total, 9,278,000?. ; and,

with 20 per cent, for distribution, 11,133,000?., equal to 0'19tl as a gross,

and 0'l7d. as a net expenditure per day per person.

                                                          Sugar.

     Sugar is partly used as food, and partly as drink. According to the
report of the Commissioners of Customs, the value of sugar retained for
consumption, in 1880, was 22,770,000?. Deducting the quantity used in
brewing, 1,136,000 cwts., value 1,200,000?., and adding the cost of refining
upon at least the half of the raw sugar consumed, 9,000,000?., the

entire cost may be taken at 24,700,000?., and, Avith 10 per cent, for profit

and distribution, 27,000,000?., or 0"50c?. as a gross, and 0'46cZ. as a net
expenditure per day per person.

                                              Tea and Coffee.

     The value of tea retained for consumption, in 1880, was 8,809,000?.

Add the duty, 3,964,000?., we have a total of 12,773,000?., and, with

20 per cent, for distribution, the total cost to consumers would be

15,327,000?., or 0'60c?. as a gross, and 0"16t/. as a net expenditure per day.
     Of coffee and cocoa, the quantity retained for consumption was valued

at 2,196,000?. Add duty, 330,000?., and 20 per cent, for profit and dis-
tribution, and we have a total of about 3,000,000?., or in the proportion

of O'Obd. as a gross, and 0'04cZ. as a net expenditure per day per person.

                                                                Beer.

     Of alcoholic drinks, the consumption is large. In the year ended
30th September, 1880, the quantity of malt brewed in the United King-
--

    ON THE PRESENT APPEOPEIATION OF WAGES, ETC.  279

dom Avas 55,850,790 busliels. At 2 bushels to the barrel it would give

27,925,395 average barrels, or 1,005,314,220 average gallons of beer.

Deducting the exports, 18,000,000 average gallons, the home con-
sumption would be 987,000,000 gallons. One thousand million gallons
is a safe number to take. The actual cost of beer is probably 7d!. per

gallon ; and at that rate the cost is 29,000,000L ; but, at the selling price
of Is, 6d., which includes duty (G,732,000Z.) and profits of distribution,
the consumers pay 75,000,000Z., or in the proportion of l-40d., the net
cost being only 0'54a!. per day per head.

                                                                      Spirits.

     The total consumption of British and foreign spirits in 1880 was
40,000,000 gallons. Taking the cost at 4s. per gallon and the sale price
at 20s., the entire cost would be 8,000,000Z., and the amount paid by
consumers, including duty, 10s. per gallon, and profit of distribution,
40,000,000Z., or at the rate of 0-7-5c^. as a gross, the net cost amounting
only to O'l'id. per head per day.

                                                       ' Wine.

     Of wine the value of the quantity retained for consumption was valued
at 5,800,000Z. Add duty l,407,O00Z. and 25 per cent, for distribution, the
total amount is 9,000,000Z., or in the proportion of O'lGtZ. as a gross
expenditure, the net being O'lOd. per day per head.

                                       Total Food and DrinTc,

     The consumption of imported articles of food and drink lias largely
increased of late years, as will be seen from the following comparison of
the quantity retained for home consumption per head of the total popu-
lation of the United Kingdom in 1840, 1860, and 1880, as given in the

statistical abstract :
ON TKE rUESENT APPROPRIATION OF WAGES, ETC.  281

25,800,000?., unci, with 20 per cent, for distribution, 31,O0O,000Z., or in the
proportion of 0-58d. as a gross, and 0"48c?. as a net expenditure per day

per head.

                                                            Wool.

     The quantity of wool left for home consumption in 1880, according

to Messrs. Helmuth Schwartze & Co.'s circular, including domestic clip'

and totalimports of wool, alpaca, and mohair, was 370,000,000 lbs., besides
92,000,000 lbs. woollen rags, torn up or not, used as wool. Deducting
the exports of woollen manufacture, which represent 90,000,000 lbs., the

remainder, 280,000,000 lbs., may be taken as the quantity consumed at
home ; and at two yards to the pound and 2s, per yard, the cost would

be 56,000,000/., besides 7,650,000Z. of woollen goods imported, making in
all 63,650,000Z.. But considerable quantities of wool are used in flannel,

blankets, rugs, carpet, and articles for the household, not articles of dress.

According to information kindly supplied by Messrs. John Scott & Co.
the approximate consumption of wool and woollen goods may be cal-

--culated as follows : For men's cloth the consumption is about 50 per

cent, at 3s. per yard, 35 per cent, at 8s. 6cl., and 15 per cent, at lis. per
yard. For women's dress 50 per cent, at 6^cZ. per yai'd, 35 per cent, at

lid., and 15 per cent, at 2s. 3d. per yai'd. And for women's mantle,

jacket, and Ulster cloths 50 per cent, at 2s. 6d., 35 per cent, at 6s., and

15 per cent, at 10s. per yard. And at these calculations if only one dress
per annum were used the cost would be 35,000,000Z. It is safe, however,
to assume a consumption of half as much for dress, making a total

of 52,600,000Z., which, with 20 per cent, for distribution, amounts to
63,000,OOOZ., or in the proportion of I'lScZ. as a gi-oss, and O'dSd. as a

net expenditure per head per day.

                      Linen.

     There is a total want of detail regarding the consumption of linen, but

it may be estimated at one-fourth of the consumption of cotton goods, viz.,

6,400,000Z., and Avith 20 per cent, for distribution, 7,700,OOOZ., or in the
proportion of 0'14(Z. as a gross, and O'llcZ. as a net expenditure per person

per day.

                      Silk.

In 1880 there were imported into the United Kingdom, of raw and

thrown silk, 3,877,000 lbs., of which, however, there were exported

955,000 lbs., leaving for home consumption 2,922,000 lbs., say 3,000,000 lbs.,
which, at 5 yards to the pound, would give 15,000,000 yards. Deduct
from this 6,200,000 yards exported, there remained for home consumption

8,800,000 yards. At 4s. p6r yard these would give a cost of about 1,700,000Z.

Add the import of silk manufacture, valued at 13,000,000Z., and we have

a total of 14,700,000Z., and with 20 per cent, for distribution, 17,600,000Z.,

or in the proportion of 0'32cZ. as a gross, and 0'27(Z. as a net expenditure
per head per day.

                                     Soots and Shoes, Eats, S)'c.

     Boots and shoes constitute an expensive and necessary article of
dress. Their cost at 8s. 6d. per pair would be 14,800,000?. Of gloves,
the home production is small. In 1880 there were imported 17,469,000
pairs, valued at 1,742,000Z. There were also imported 463,000Z. worth
of artificial flowers, and seal-skins to the value of 623,000L Sealskin
jackets are a great luxury. The import price in 1880 averaged 19'08s.

per skin, and it is not uncommon for such jackets to be sold for 40L and 50Z.
On hats, the amount expended may be taken at 2,000,000L, making a total

for these articles of 19,600,000, and with 20 per cent, for distribution
23,o00,000Z., or in the proportion of 0'4A<d. as a gross, and 0-39d. as a net
expenditure per head per day.

                                                                           Gold and Silver Plate.

There is further the expenditure on gold and silver. According to

Mr. Giffen's evidence before the House of Commons' Committee on hall-

marks, about four and a half million ounces of silver are aniiually used

in the United Kingdom for manufacture. At 4s. 6d. per oz. that would

represent little more than 1,000,000?., but in the manufacture of the

precious metals the cost of workmanship is greatly in excess of the value

of the raw material. Taking an average of IZ. per oz., the total amount

expended would be 4,500,000?. The amount expended in gold plate

and jewellery must be considerable, but there is no means to estimate

the same. The expenditure of the precious metals differs considerably

in years of commercial prosperity and years of commercial depression.

Therefore it can scarcely be considered a constant in the expenditure of

the people                                                   nevertheless  it  may  be safely  estimated that  upwards  of
                                                          ;

5,000,000?. are yearly expended in gold and silver plate, to say nothing of

diamonds. Allowing 20 per cent, for distribution the expenditure would

be in the proportion of 0-09d. gross, and 0'07c?. net per head per day.

                                                          House-rent.

     After food and clotliing comes liotise-rent. The amount cliai-ged to
duty on dwelling-Iiouses in 1878-9 was 36,609,000L, and the annual
value of dwelling-houses not liable to duty under 201. was 32,692,000Z.,
making a total of 69,301,000?. Adding one-fifth to the amount charged
with inhabited house duty, 8,000,000?., in order to obtain the real amount

of rent, the total amount so expended is 77,000,000?., equal to VMd.

per head per day. Assuming house property to return 6 per cent., the
net cost would be about 72,500,000?., giving a proportion of l-36c?. per

day per head.

                                                           Furniture.

     To house-rent we must add the expense for furniture. The number
of houses built yearly averages 60,000. At 100?. furniture each the
expense of furnishing them would be 6,000,000?. But existing houses
require constant additions and renewal. The total number of houses is
now 6,500,000,1 and the total rental may be estimated at 100,000,000?.
Let only 5 per cent, on the amount of rental be taken for renewal of
furniture and the amount is 5,000,000?., making a total, with the furni-
ture of new houses, of 11,000,000?. Deduct from this 20 per cent, for

distribution, and the expenditure is 0-20f?. gross, and O'lSd. net per head

per day.

                                                                   Coal.

     The consumption of cofil for housfehold pui-poses was given by the
Royal Commissioners in 1869 at 18,000,000 tons. Assuming the present
consumption at 20,000,000 tons, its value at 12.s. per ton wholesale, and
16s. retail, would be 12,000,000?. and 15,000,000?. respectively, or at the
rate of 0-29c?. as the gross, and 0-22fZ. as the net cost per head per day.

                                                                Gas.

   We have no account of the total expenditure on gas and other

descriptions of light, such as paraffin, tallow, stearine and wax candles,

&c., all over the kingdom. The total amount of gas-rate (private lights),
received by the Metropolitan Gas Companies is about 3,000,000?., repre-
senting an expenditure of 16s. per head. Taking 10s. a head for the
whole urban population and 5s. a head for the rural, the whole expendi-
ture would be 13,700,000?. Deducting 20 per cent, for distribution, and
the amount is 11,000,000?., or in the proportion of 0-25d. as the gross,
and 20d. as the net expenditure per day for every individual.

                                                          Water.

    No data exist for estimating the expenditure for water. Here also

the expenditure in cities is greatly in excess of the expenditure in

rural districts, whilst considerable quantities of water are used for manu-

Another branch of expenditure is tobacco, extensively consumed and

highly taxed. In the year ended March 31, 1880, the quantity of tobacco
entered for home consumption was, unmanufactured, 48,191,000 lbs.

manufactured cigars, 1,1.50,000 lbs. ; other sorts, 1.53,000 lbs. ; valued at

2,877,000Z.                                                   and  the  amount  of  duty  was      8,78o,-554Z.,  making a total of

11,661,000Z. Add 20 per cent, to the quantity of unmanufactured tobacco

for other ingredients used in the process of manufacture, and calculate

the whole at 4s. Od. per lb. for tobacco and 12s. per lb. for foreign manu-

facture, and the amount paid will be 13,176,000Z., the proportion being

0-24cZ. as the gross, and 0-05d. as the net expenditure per head per day

for each individual.

                                                                        Education and Church.

                                                        Education,

     The expenditure on education is partly of a public and partly of a

              _

private character. The income for elementary education in the year
1879-80 was, in England and Wales, 5,078,000Z. ; Scotland, 848,000Z.
and Ireland, 772,000Z. Total, 6,698,0OOZ. This amount, representing the
cost of 3,590,000 children in attendance in the three kingdoms, is in the
proportion of 11. 17s. per child. Taking the Public Elementary Schools

to cover three-fourths of- the" children of school age, there are at least
900,000 children not included in the above, which, at 31. per pupil, will

give 2,700,000Z. To these there m'ust be added the income of the
Grammar and other Endowed Schools, given by the Commissioners at
ON THE I'EKSENT ArmOPKIATION OF WAGES, ETC.  285

330,000?. ; of the Public Schools, G5,000Z. ; the income of the Universities,
estimated at 1,000,000/. ; and the public grants for Science Art Museiims,
amounting to -580,000/., making a total expenditure on education of
upwards of 11,000,000/., only a fifth of which probably is on material, viz.,
2,200,000/., or 0-20t/. gross and 0-04/. net per head per day.

                                   Literature, Science, and Art.

     The number of books published during the year, including new books
and new editions, as given in the ' Publishers' Circular,' in the five years
from 1875 to 1879, averaged 5,200. Taking only 500 copies per book
and 4s. per volume, the amount would be 7,200,000/. Probably 5,000,000/.
is a safe amount to take as the annual expenditure. The expenditure for

Science includes the subscriptions to scientific societies, the maintenance
of private observatories and museums, schools, &c. The Art Exhibitions,
and the high prices given for painting, sculpture, &c., show that a con-

siderable amount is expended in the same. The total thus expended
under this head may be calculated at 7,000,000/. gross, or 5,000,000/. net,
or in the proportion of 0'13c/. gross and 0'09c/. net per head per day.

                                                          Neivspapers.

     Another important branch of expenditure eminently educational is the
daily newspaper. In 1854 the number of stamps imjjressed on news-

papers in the United Kingdom was 122,178,000. Since then, however,

the stamp duty and the advertisement duty alike have been abolished, and
the penny paper has been started with marvellous success. Taking the
daily issue at 4,000,000, the cost to the public would be 5,000,000/. gross
and 3,500,000/. net, or in the proportion of 0'09t/. gross and O'OGtZ. net

     Of considerable importance as respects the amount is the expenditure for
ecclesiastical purposes. In 1871 there were in the United Kingdom 62,950
clergymen and others connected with religious oflfices. Taking the number
now at 75,000 and their average income at 150/. per year, the total

-- --would be 11,125,000/., alarge portion fully a half, however derived from

tithes and other endowments, and only about five millions as expended
from annual income. In 1851 there were in England and Wales 31,000

places of worship of all denominations. At this moment in the United
Kingdom there must be at least 50,000. Assuming only 200/. for expense
of maintenance, caretakiug, insurance, &c., the amount is 10,000,000/. ; in

this case also about the half being provided by endowments. Besides this
there is the amount contributed for missionary purposes, given in 1880 at
1,700,000/. Altogether the amount expended for ecclesiastical purposes

out of the annual income may be taken at 12,000,000/., but only one-

fifth of the amount as expenditure apart from salaries, viz., 2,400,000/.,
or at the proportion of 0-23d. gross and 0-04fZ. net, per head per day.

                                                Amusements.

                                     Theatres and Music Halls.

     Lastly, there is the amount expended in amusements of all kinds.
First in importance is the theatre. In 1877 Mr. Hollingshead gave in
evidence that in London there were forty-five theatres licensed b}^ the
Lord Chamberlain, and six licensed by the magistrates, with a nightly
holding capacity of 76,000, being on an average of twenty per 1,000
--286 EEPORT 1881.

inhabitants. Assuming theatrical provision on the same proportion among

the 20,000,000 of urban population, there would be provision of- 400,000,

and at l.s. 6d. each for 200 nights, the total sum would be 6,O0O,0O0L
The ' Bra Almanac ' gives a list of about 276 theatres, and this, at an
average capacity of 1,400, would give an aggregate capacity of 386,000.
The London theatres are considerably larger. Of music-halls the number
o-iven in the ' Era ' is 216. Taking their average capacity at 400 and at
6d. per night, also for 250 nights, the sum so expended would be about
500,000L, making, with the theatrical, an expenditure of 6,500,000Z.,

only one-fourth of which, viz., 1,600,000Z., is spent in materials, or in the
proportion of 0'12cZ. gross and 0-03(7. net per head per day.

                                                 Other Armisements.

     The Crystal Palace is a type of another order of amusements. By
the courtesy of the manager, Major Page, we learn that the average
number of visitors who paid for admission in the three years, 1878 to
1880, was 988,760, of whom 833,728 were adults, and 15.5,032 children,
besides nearly as many of season-ticket holders, performers, and others.
The ordinary receipts of the Company from admissions in 1880 were
40,000L, and the amount received from reserved seats and programmes
20,604L, making a total of 60,600Z., giving an avei'age of about Is. 3cZ. per
person. Add Is. Qtl. for the railway and 6(Z. for refreshment in excess of

--the cost at home, we may assume that every visitor pays at least 3s. 3cZ.

There are, however, special days Boxing Day and Easter ]\Ionday, and

--two other Bank holidays, or equivalent days in the manufacturing dis-

tricts, in all four days in the year when a large portion of the population

is in quest of amusement. On one such day in London 120,000 find

their way to the Crystal and Alexandra Palaces, 72,000 to the different

Galleries, and 95,000 to the Zoological, and Horticultural, and Kew

Gardens. Assuming that on such days one in ten of the urban popula-
tion, or about 2,000,000, is bent on amusement, and that on an average
 3s. per head is the amount expended, the total for each day would be
300,000^., or for the four days 1,200,000L' But there are amusements of

quite another order. How shall we estimate the expense incurred on the

 Derby day or on racing all the year. There are about 2,500 race-horses,
 the breeding and training of which cost 300Z. each, or 750,000Z. The
 amount spent in a month's grouse-shooting by a single party is jiut down

 at least at 4477. Fox-hunting is another heavy source of expenditure.
 There are 150 packs of fox-hounds kept in England and Wales, the

 aggregate cost of which, including the cost of hunters, is put down at
 700,0007. Then there is fishing, coursing, cricket, archery, bicycling,^

      ' The weekly railway receipts indicate the effect of a holiday on the movements
 of the people. Taking the entire passengers' receipts of the Great Eastern, Great
 Northern, Great Western, London and Brighton, London, Chatham, and Dover,
 London and South-Western, Midland, and London and North- Western for the week
 before, and the week after the Bank holidays in 1880, the excess of receipts
 amounted to 260,000Z., but as many take their holiday before the actual day, and
 many return after the same, the account is not exact. The average receipts per
 annum for the last three years for traffic to the Crystal Palace by the London,
 Brighton, and South Coast Railway were 25,6557. On Easter Monday the receipts
 were 1,084Z. ; on Whit Monday 1,0221. ; on the August Bank Holiday 790/., and on
 Boxing Day 466Z.

      - The Secretary of the Bicycle Union informs us that 100,000 may be taken as
 the number of machines in use, entailing an annual expense of about 500,000Z., besides
 the expense of subscription to clubs, uniforms, repairs, and many more items.

Aand numerous other sports, all involving a large expenditure.                                                                                              total

To the personal expenditure thus traced we should add the amount paid

to the State and expended by the same, as well as the amount paid to the

local government. In the year ended March 31, 1880, the amount paid

in customs, excise stamps and duties, land tax, house duty and property and

income tax, amounted to 67,826, OOOL Of this 44,626,OO0Z. have already

appeared in the personal expenditure for food and drink. There remains,

therefore, to be added 23,200,000Z. of public taxation, while for local

purposes the amount levied direct by rates in 1873-74, was 24,332,000/.,

making a total of 47,532,000/. Of the 92,158,000/., thus levied by taxes

(public and local), by far the largest portion is expended in salai'ies in

the United Kingdom. What may be considered as nationally expended

are votes for supply, manufacture, and repair of warlike and other stores,

1,200,000/. ; superintending establishment of, and expenditure for, works,

buildings, and repairs, at home and abroad, 850,000/. ; dockyards and

naval yards, at home and abroad, 1,300,000/. ; naval stores, 1,000,000/.

Colonial Civil Services 567,000/. ; in all 6,967,000/. The proportion beino-

0'89d. gross, and 0'13c/. net per head per day.

                             Cost and Profits op Disteibution.

    In order to ai'rive at the real expenditure, we have deducted 20 per

cent, from retail prices for the cost and profits of distribution, as well as
all taxes imposed on articles of food and drink. The real cost and profits
of distribution should, however, be calculated as adding to the utilities
of the articles consumed. The amount deducted for distribution beino-
155,000,000/., the half representing the real cost is 77,500,000/., which
gives a proportion of 1"45(:/. per head per day.

    Summing up the different items of expenditure, incomplete as I fear

they must be, they are as follows :

                                                Total Expenditure.

     These two sums give an average expenditure per day per head of
IG-QSd. as the personal, and 12-71d. as the real or national expenditure, or
251. per annum in the one case, and 191. in the other.

Balance of Income and Expenditure.

Comparing now these amounts with the personal and national income

the results are as follows :  £

Income                        915,000,000

Expenditure                   6 85,000,000

Excess                        230,000,000

     The excess of annual income appears very large, but the result
arrived at by a method altogether different approaches very nearly

that of j\Ir. Giffen by the capitalisation at different times of the different

sources of income.

     The different items of espenditnre above enumerated are far, indeed,
from exhaustive. The important items of domestic service, medical at-
tendance, carriage and horses, travelling by railway and steamboat, by
omnibus and tramway,' and charity, would each and all amount to large
sums. But the greater part of such expenditure remains iu the country,
and consists of a simple transfer from hand to hand, having but little
influence on the main question of the national expenditure.

   The expenditure of the people might be classified into expenditure
abroad and expenditure at home, expenditure in materials, expen-
diture in wages, and expenditure for the necessaries of life and for
luxuries. Without attempting any further analysis, and having regard
to the facts above stated, in connection especially with what has been
recently brought out by the Census, of a continuously increasing

--population the effect of an increasing birth-rate and a decreasing
--death-rate we may conclude that the present appropriation of wages

and other income cannot be said to be opposed to the economic progress

of the people of the United Kingdom. A minute examination of the

different items of expenditure is, indeed, calculated to remove the im-

pression of any great extravagance on the part of tlie people as a whole.

A lar^e expenditure in bread, meat, woollen goods, and house-rent is a

most economical expenditure. An expenditure of 124,000,000Z. on alco-

holic drinks is certainly very large, but reduced to the real expenditure

the sum total is 42,000,000?. Thei-e is one element, however, which does
not appear from this calculation, which might prove most nnsatisfactoiy

--if properly inquired into, and it is that the averages arrived at are, in

many cases, the mean of two extremes the extreme of waste and the ex-

treme of penury ; for side by side with those living in Inxilry and having
no thought of waste, there are large numbers whose conditions of
nourishment, state of dwelling-houses and clothing, are of the lowest
character. Nothing is gained by exaggerated statements of the national
loss arising from the wasteful consumption of this or that article, or by
takino- as a national loss that which is in effect nothing more than the
transfer of money from one to another ; but a proper regard to the right
expenditure of money is of the highest importance to the individual and

to the nation, for waste and profligacy are the parent of pauperism, de-

     The Committee is fully aware that some of the deductions and

reasonings in this report are not founded upon well-ascertained facts,
nevertheless it deemed it useful to present them as materials for considera-

tion, and as helps to the elucidation of a subject of the highest social and

economic importance. The report points out many wants and desidei-ata,

and the Committee recommends the reappointment of the Committee,
with an increased number of members, for the purpose of suggesting
means for supplying the same on a uniform and scientific basis.

Report of a Committee, consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S.,
   F.R.A.S., E. J. Lowe, F.R.S., Professor E. S. Ball, F.R.S.,

   Dr. Walter Flight, F.G.S., and Professor A. S. Herschel, 3I.A.,

   F.R.A.S., on Observations of Luminoios Meteors during the
   year 1880-81.

Op regular systematic observations of luminous meteors during the past

year, the Committee has very few particulars to report. The expected
passage of the earth, at the end of November last, through the cluster or

train of meteors circulating in the orbit of Biela's comet, proved to be
only a source of disappointment, as no marked abundance of Andromedes

during the last vreek of November 1880 v/as anywhere noticed by observers.
But a somewhat unusual display of the Leonids on the morning of No-

vember 14 was recorded in America, and the descriptions of the shower

were corroborated by observations of numerous bright Leonids at Mon-

calieri, near Turin, on the same meteoric date. The existence of a sen-

sible cluster in the stream following the principal one, about thirteen

years later in its encounter with the earth, and of another preceding the

main group at about the same interval, is shown by Professor Kirkwood

from past appearances of the November meteors to be pretty satisfactorily

established.

   A considerable display of the quadrantids of the lst-3rd of January

was also noted by Mr. Denning at Bristol on the morning of January 2,
1880, showing that periods of especial brightness of this shower, like those

of the other annual displays, are features of its appearance which would

certainly reward observers' close attention.

Of the Geminids and Lyrids no notable returns were recorded during

tbe past year, and the extreme brightness of full-moon light prevented

tlie August Perseids from exhibiting any unusual appearance. At the

few places where a sufficiently clear sky enabled observers to be on the
watch for them, the annual meteor shower on August 10, 1881, seemed

to be, in point of frequency and brightness, of an exceptionally meagre
and inconspicuous description.

Notices of occasional fire-balls and bright meteors have been re-

corded and published from time to time during the past year. But
these announcements not having been immediately followed up by timely

inquiries for similar accounts from other quarters, have furnished little

Aof very weighty impoi'tance to describe.     few real paths have been

deduced ; but of these and of the miscellaneous observations of shooting-
stars and fire-balls that have been collected during the past few years,

more leisure would be needed for reduction and description than passing

circumstances of the Committee's labours have allowed it to bestow upon

Athem.    careful review and attentive comparison of the materials, how-

ever, will yet, it may be hoped, enable the Committee to offer at a futui-e

time, by their arrangement and discussion, some astronomical deductions

and conclusions of more enduring interest and consequence than the

promiscuous chronicle of ephemeral phenomena which at present con-

stitutes the unassorted accumulation of the past few years meteor-

records.

-- --of chromite in nodules an entirely new character of metallic irons in the

iron meteorites of Cohahuila. The structure of meteoric irons themselves

is undergoing microscopical examination, and evidence of the strongest

kind is furnished by the inspection that in many of them solidification

must have proceeded in the quietest conditions, with crystallisation of
perfect symmetry and regularity throughout their mass. Three recent

--stone-falls are recorded on November 4, 1879, early in May 1880, and
--on March 14, 1881 in India, Persia, and in England.

Of the last aerolite, which weighed about three and a-half pounds,

the descent in our own country is one of special interest to the present

meeting of the British Association, which celebrates its fiftieth gathering

in the county and city of its birth, at York, from the meteorite having

Aquite recently fallen in that county.  fuller account of this stone-fall,

and of the aerolite itself, than that given by Dr. Flight is, from exami-

nations of the circumstances connected with it by Professor Herschel,

added in another appendix of this Report. Although no analysis of the

stone has yet been made, it appears, by comparison with other aerolites in

the collection of the British Museum, conducted with a specimen presented

by the North-Eastern Railway Company to the National Mineralogical

Collection, to be of the ordinary grey chondritic class, a class of the com-

monest type of aerolites, which comprises in itself at least four-fifths of

all the iron and stone masses which have actually been seen to fall. This

recent accession, therefore, to the globe's geological constituents, furnishes

another instance of the prevailing uniformity of meteoritic substance,

and of its never-failing conformity, in the great majority of aerolites, to a
well-marked mineralogical description which distinguishes them very

strikingly from ordinary terrestrial rocks. The Middlesbrough aerolite is

also remarkable in its outward form by the unusual distinctness of the

deep grooves and furrows with which it is indented by heat and attrition
of the air, on that rounded side or low summit of the stone which must

evidently have been constantly presented foremost to the action of the

resisting fiery atmosphere which impeded the aerolite's motion in its

suddenly arrested course.

   A year or two ago attention was directed to the discovery by Dr. L.

Smith of daubreelite in one of these irons. He has since met with a

nodule of chromite in the interior of compact iron from one of these masses.
His attention was attracted to an enclosed nodule, the lustre of which
was less vitreous than that of the chromium sulphide : it was virtually a

black granular mass. When heated with strong nitric acid in the water,

bath, not the slightest impression was made upon it, thus showing that
it is not daubreelite. Heating it in fused sodium carbonate in no way

verised mineral was fused with ten times its weight of sodium bisulphate,
and was attacked but not dissolved. Subsequent treatment with sodium
carbonate and nitre broke it up, and the results of the analysis were :

    While chromite has been known to be associated with meteorites, this
is the first instance of its having been found embedded in this manner in

the interior of meteoric iron.

     Some of the particles of chromite, when placed in a very intense

light, were found to be feebly translucent, and to have a dark reddish-
purple colour. This observation, it appears, had already been made by
M. Stanislaus Meunier, of Paris.

Almost every band of kamacite, 1"5 to 3 millimetres across, carries a bar

thick, and around this is an irregular shell of beam-iron.

     Brezina points out that in the Catalogue prepared by Tschermak *
this iron is indicated as Of, showing fine-ruled Widmanstiittian figures.
It difiers, however, very much from othev irons of this group, like that
from Lion River, Jewell Hill, Charlotte, &c., while it closely resembles

the Butler iron (see below). While, however, in the latter case the chief
walls of the skeleton enclose very large chambers, here they are very

small, so that the skeleton-character is far less mai'ked. The charac-
teristic of the two ii'ons of Butler and Tazewell rests mainly on the very
unusual smallness of the octahedral lamellae, whereby the beam-iron, or its

representative, almost vanishes, the irons consisting almost entirely of
interstitial and band-iron (and of troilite enclosed in both, and schreibersite

plates in Tazewell). Whether the almost infinitely thin nucleus of the
lamellae is identical with the ordinary beam-iron can only be decided by
further investigation. The appearance of traces of granular structure

renders it very probable.

This iron has already been described by Broadhead- and Smith,^ the

latter finding it remarkable for the very large and regular Widmanstattian

Afigures which it displays.                                     specimen, weighing 1 kilogramme, 334

grammes, acquired by the Vienna Collection from Dr. L. Smith, was found,

to have three etched surfaces nearly perpendicular to each other. It was

noticed that the greater part of the iron had an even dull appearance, but

--in this lustreless iron-grey part lay numerous in part individual, in part

irregularly cohering lamellae, of which four differently directed systems

appear on the sections. The lamellae together form an octahedral skeleton,

just as in Tschermak's schematic figure 5 * the crystal-structure of iron

The nuclei of the lamelliB are purely granular, and in several respects show

the greatest resemblance to the ground-mass (in hardness, &c.) ; only a
few exhibit feebly in their broader parts a granular structure like what the

beam-iron of other irons presents. The lamelte are covered with band-

ii'on (tanite) which is recognised by its high lustre and pale isabel-yellow

colour                                they are very smal], the  nucleus  and its  two covers being in few

cases more than l-60th of a millimetre broad, and the length usually 15 to

20 mm. (some are 30 mm.) When lamellfe diSerently directed come

together, one system is usually developed quite complete, as if produced,

before the other; sometimes, though rarely, nucleus springs from nucleus
and cover from cover, in proof of the simultaneous origin of the two

systems.

"Prom the main structure of the four systems, not only parallel, but

also, in sparing quantities, irregularly orientated small plates intersect

the ground-mass. To microscopically minute substructures of them is

due the peculiar play of light of that part of the iron. Troilite occurs in
rounded or lenticular masses, some 2 centimetres in diameter, but none

is found in the lamellated systems.

    The largest of the sections does not vary very much (about 13°) from
the position of a leucitohedral face ; three distinctly marked lamellar

systems cross it at angles of 70°, 61°, and 49°. For the face (533) the

corresponding values are

              + =G5-4°, 0°, 65-4°, 49-2° (0° 65-4°) 65-4°.

   A fragment of this iron in the Vienna Collection is stated by the writer

to exhibit broad and very regular Widmanstiittian figures. The beam-iron

averages 2 mm. across ; this iron is almost exclusively developed, with
Tinnsually sharp lines of etching. Band and interstitial iron are only

present in traces, and schreibersite and troilite are not recognisable.

   A fragment in the shape of a wedge was found to exhibit Widman-

stattian figures of average size, which in certain places by the massive
development of schreibersite were broken through : the band-iron is of
average breadth, the interstitial iron distinguished by its unusual dark

colour. In many places the magnetite fills partings which penetrate from

the natural surface to a depth of 2 to 3 centimetres into the iron.

     Brezina records the presentation to the Vienna Collection of a piece

of a meteorite weighing 165 grammes by Mr. M. Wood, of the Bombay
Bi'anch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The fall occurred at the above

place and date, and the stone has the form of a four-sided wedge, with a
nearly square base. Its weight is 10| lbs. and 197 grains, and its density
is 3 "45. According to an incomplete analysis 58" 75 per cent, was in-
soluble in hydrogen-chloride (consisting of silicates, and the silicic acid
of the decomposed portion), and, in addition, there was ii"on oxide, or
rather iron protoxide with alumina 27*62, nickel 1'56, lime 0'83, and
magnesia 11'88 per cent. The meteorite resembles Forsyth, has a bright
yellowish ground-mass ; the chondra ai'e firmly enclosed in the ground-
mass, and for the most part white and felspathic. This stone is to be
classed with the white chondrites.

--1880 {early in). Colorado Basin, Ivanpah, Soidheni California.'''

This block of iron was found in the Colorado Basin, within eight miles

of Ivanpah, which is about 200 miles north-east of San Bernardino in

Southern California, by a Mr. Goddard, who while crossing a wash had

his attention arrested by a singular-looking boulder. The block is oval

in shape, having a side somewhat flattened ; its surface is covered with

depressions and dents, as if it had been pelted all over with pebbles while

soft or plastic. These concavities are from 1 to 4 inches across, and, in

addition, there are three round holes an inch deep, as if made by the little

finger. The mass is supposed to weigh 120 lbs., and it is 14 inches long,

9 inches broad, and 7 inches deep. The examination of a fragment shows

it to be highly crystalline, requiring no etching to reveal the Widman-

stattian figures ; the cleavage appears to be octahedral. The schreibersite

is very thin, and, according to Shepard, of two kinds : one in flat leaves,

the other in wavy semi- cylinders  or irregular prisms                                                                                     the latter, he says,

' The fall of a meteorite -which -was actually seen, and which is not an

event of every- day occurrence, deserves, on account of its mineralogical

interest, some slight notice. It is not possible here to ascertain with cer-

tainty  the constituent  minerals                                          it  is  therefore                      possible  at  present  only  to

give a short sketch of the stone ; later on, when wei have the material to

work with and the help of an authority in this branch, we may return to

the subject. In the first half of the m.onth of May last year, 1880, we

were called before the Shah, who handed to us a metallic shining mineral,

weighing about 400 grammes, which, from the outer crust still adhering

Weto it, we at once recognised as a meteorite.                                                                    saw that the Shah took

the shining metal in it for silver, for he asked the value of it. But when

we spoke of the iron, and its probably containing nickel, and that the

mineral had more scientific than intrinsic worth, it was permitted to us to

take the stone away, and to break off a piece for closer examination.

' The Shah made himself acquainted with the origin and cause of

meteorites, and informed us that the stone in question weighed 45 kilo-

grammes, and fell in the neighbourhood of the village of Karand, twelve

miles east of Teheran, with an explosive noise like thunder.

' Half of the stone was covered with a thin, blackish, fused crust, while

the fresh lustrous fractured surface showed it to have formed a portion of

Aa much larger stone.        fragment weighing 3-66 grammes was found to

possess a density of 4-36. The fractured surface showed a grey, passing

into green, ground-structure, with, in places, single pieces of an oil-green

mineral, with a lustre of glass, probably olivine. In the mass lay, closely

strewn together, small and large granules of white iron ; also little plates
of this metal lay enclosed in it, and violet-blue tinted grains, similar in

their play of colour to copper pyrites.

' The pulverised mineral is pretty light, and almost entirely soluble in

hydrochloric acid. The fractured surface was covered in a few days with

a thin oxidised crust, although some portions of it are as fresh after five

months as at first.'

    My friend, the esteemed Secretary of our Committee, has drawn

attention to the fall of a meteoric stone, near Middlesbrough, during the
early months of this year. The day was bright, the air calm, and the sun

shining when it fell, about 19 yards from the signal-box and 48 from the
spot where two or three men were standing, and when picked out of the
bole which it had made in the ground it was still -^'arm. He writes : ' It

is a beautifully perfect meteorite, of a low pyramidal or shell-like shape,
measuring about 5 inches by 6, and about 3 inches high, and it weighs
3^ lbs. The grey tufaceous stone, of which it consists internally, is, as
usual, completely glazed over, or enveloped in a thin black molten crust,
which hides from the eye its true stony character, the latter being only
visible here and there at its grazed edges.'

    A portion has been sent to the British Museum for analysis. With

the exception of this little piece removed, the almost undisfigured

meteorite was shown at York in the Museum of Scientific Objects at the
jubilee meeting of the British Association. It is now deposited in the
York Philosophical Society's Geological Museum.

     The meteoritic stone-fall recorded in this paper took place at 3.35
p.m., on a clear and bright, but rather cold and windy, afternoon in
March last, on a part of the North-Eastern Railway Company's branch-
line from Middlesbrough to Guisbrough, at a point where a short siding
and signal-box upon the line, established in connection Avith some brick-
fields adjoining it, are known from them by the name of Pennyman's
Siding. The place is about a mile and three quarters from Middles-
brough along the Guisbrough branch line, and a few miles on the

Middlesbrough side of tlie first station on the line at Ormsby. The fall

-was witnessed by the permanent-Avay inspector, W. Ellinor, and three

platelayers engaged in repairing a switch-heel at the siding ; it was first

announced to them by a whizzing or rushing noise in the air, followed

in a second or two by a sudden blow of a body striking the ground not

Afar from them.  little search revealed the hole made by the stone at the

foot of the slight embankment of the south side of the line, about forty-

eight yards from the place where they had been working, and less than

twenty yards from the signal-box, in which the pointsman and one of the

platelayers were conversing, and the latter thought that a stone had

been thrown at the building by his companions outside, to attract his

attention.

     The direction of the wind, which was only a light air, was from N.B.

but it was fresh at Pinchingthorpe and neighbouring places in the district,
and it is, perhaps, on that account that no sound of a report in the air
accompanying the fall was heard either where the stone fell or at places

near it in the Guisbrough and Cleveland District, at Pinchingthorpe,
Hutton-Gate, Guisbrough, Maske, Saltburn, and Redcar, where informa-

tion on this point was requested from the station-masters of the railway

by one of the North-Eastern Railway Company's engineers of the Dar-

lington District, Mr. W. Cndworth.
    On the other hand, information sought and collected by Mr. W. R.

Smithson, of Northallerton, in the north-eastern part of Yorkshire, proved
that a considerable detonation was perceived, both at Northallerton and
four miles east of Northallerton (by himself ; eighteen miles S.S.W. from
Middlesbrough), and also at Welbury, twelve miles from Middlesbrough

in the same direction, and at Chopgate in Bidsdale, among the Cleveland

Hills, about ten miles S.S.B. from the place of fall. These scanty indi-
cations point apparently to a direction of the meteor's flight, if it was not
quite vertical, from some quarter in the south. But the direction of the

wind may have led to the distant au.dibility of the sound in the south-

west, and not in other parts of Yorkshire near the place of fall.
    At all these points the sound resembled the boom of a gun, or of a

gunpowder or boiler explosion in the distance, so loud as to be likened to
thunder at Northallerton, the furthest known point at which it was heard.
At Welbury, twelve miles from Middlesbrough, on the i^ailway between

that town and Northallerton, some platelayers heard it, and described it
as sufficiently forcible to shake the earth and a rail upon which one of
them was seated. It was not a solitary bounce, but a concussion, followed
by a soughing sound, and then by a second crash, resembling the tipping
of stones, or like an echo from rocks or woods when a gun is fired. The
direction of the first boom was, like that recorded at the other places by
pi'oper compass measurements, in the direction of Middlesbrough. But
tlie following crash is desci'ibed as coming from a different quarter, from

the east, or south-east, at Welbury, and it may either have been an echo
of the original sound among the Cleveland hills, a few miles east of Wel-

buiy, or perhaps an indication of an earlier part of the meteor's course
over the region of those hills due south from Middlesbrough, before the
final stoppage of its flight.

     Neither at the place of fall, nor at any other point of observation
where accounts were furnished, do any luminous or cloud-forming pheno-
mena of the fire-ball's passage in the air seem to have been seen, notwith-
standing the clear brightness of the sky which was everywhere reported

to have prevailed. Combining this negative evidence with the moderate

description of the atmospheric concussion which the accounts of the re-

port convey, it seems most probable that the direction of the fire-ball's
descending course through the rarest strata of the atmosphere must have

been nearly vertical, so as to escape general observation in the beaming-

sunshine by its great altitude overhead. The almost exactly vertical

direction of the hole pierced in the earth by the stone's penetration
through the coke-ballast of the railway- slope affords evidence of the same

general directional character with what is indicated by the aerial pheno-

mena which have been described.

  -- --The stone was warm ' new milk warm' when felt with the hand at the

bottom of the hole by the platelayer who found it a few minutes after the

fall. It was extracted, without injury or disturbance of the hole, with the
hand and after the first surprise at the occurrence, it was left on a ballast

                             ;

heap, and a communication of the circumstances, and consignment of the

stone, were made next day by Mr. Bllinor to the Railway Engineer, Mr.

W. Cndwoi'th, who was passing on the line. Immediate care of the

meteorite was taken by Mr. Cudworth, who took those steps for its

preservation which have secured its present exhibition in the collection

of the Tork Museum, and who by his subsequent efforts collected most of

the local information on the stone-fall which it has been the immediate

object of this paper to describe.

    The weight of the meteorite as found was about 31bs. S^ozs. ; and

its entirely fused and crusted surface has scarcely suffered any visible

abrasions by the fall and extraction from the earth. It is a slightly
scolloped or conchoidal-looking, low pyramid, of between five and six

inches width in the two dimensions of its base, and about three inches

high. The rounded summit and sloping sides are scored and grooved,

with a polish like black-lead, in waving furrows running to the base,

showing that this side was foremost during the whole of the fusing action
of the atmosphere which the meteorite underwent in its flight. The
rear, or base, is equally fused and branded by heat, but rough, dull brown

in colour, and not scored or furrowed. From the size of the hole which

it j^ierced, it must have struck the earth front- foremost, and have turned
edgewise finally on nearing the bottom of the hole. It is somewhat

difficult from this circumstance to assign a real axis of the hole's direction.

But the penetration-line sloped apparently about 10° from the vertical, from

the S.S.E. The hole was eleven inches deep, penetrating with knife-like

sharpness the surface herbage, and seven or eight inches of coke-ballast,

and thereafter brick-earth or coarse clay to the remaining depth. By the

courtesy of the North-Eastei'n Railway Company's Directors and servants,

the hole has been preserved entire, enclosing it with some hundredweights
mof the surrounding earth
                           situ in a strong box with a sheet iron floor,

which Avas slid under it through the yielding clay.^

    An experiment was also made at the same time on the work of pene-

tration of a cast-iron model of the aerolite, driven in front of a short oak

pile to the same depth into the earth, at an immediately adjoining spot,

by repeated falls, through about four feet, of a heavy iron drop- weight

weighing 701bs. The iron model was first driven front-foremost,

    > The earth-chest was placed in the Museum of the Tork Philosophical Society

during the meeting of the British Association in the city. Its unwieldy weight is

now replaced there by a light plaster model taken of the surface and of the burrow-
like bore-hole made bj^ the meteorite in the earth which it contained.

and then edgewise, to the prescribed depth into the ground, for which,

fifty blows were found to be necessary in the first, and twenty blows in
Athe latter form of the experiment.
                                       mean of these may fairly be

adopted as affording a pretty accurate determination of the aerolite's real

energy of impact and of its work of penetration through the solid earth.

This^measured quantity was 9,307 ft.-lbs., and taking the stone's weight

as 31bs. 8J,ozs. when it fell, it is easy to infer from this that the actual
velocity of fall with which the stone struck the ground must have been

412ft. per second. As it would acquire this velocity by falling freely

through 440 fathoms, or half-a-mile, while in falling freely forty miles

from the highest regions of the atmosphere to the earth, it would reach

the earth's surface with a velocity nine times as great as that actually

observed, it is sufficiently clear how little of the original planetary speed

with which it entered the atmosphere can have remained over to affect in

any marked degree either the terminal velocity or the verticality of its fall.
The immense opposition and resistance which the air offers to the
intruder's passage, even through its upper strata, is, in fact, evident from

the deep erosions, by heat and attrition together, which the aerolite's front

surface has received.

   A model, hand-moulded in clay, and then cast in plaster, of the

meteorite, easil}^ coloured to imitate it, with brushed black-lead on the

furrowed face, and with dull brown paint upon the back, was made by Pro-

fessor Herschel on the arrival of the stone at Newcastle, where the aerolite

Awas publicly exhibited for a short time.  copy of the model was sent to

the British Museum, and was there shown in the newly opened galleries

of the Mineralogical Department of the Natural History Collection at
South Kensington. The stooe itself was also beautifally photographed in
several positions by Mr. Gould, the artist-photographer of Sir William

Armstrong's Ordnance Works in Newcastle-on-Tyne, and copies of these

photographs and of the model were distributed to several quarters, one, at

Dr. Brezina's request, being sent with a small specimen of the stone to the

Vienna Imperial Mineralogical Museum.

     Calculated from the water- displacement of the model, the stone's

specific gravity is 3'15. But this estimate may be a little underrated,

from a small exaggeration of the marginal outline, perhaps not entirely
counteracted by opposite errors of the thickness of the model imitation.

Approached to a silk-suspended magnetised needle the meteorite attracts
it in all positions slightly, showing a uniform distribution through it of a

sensible quantity of metallic iron, . which, however, usually imparts to
ordinary stony aerolites a rather higher average specific gravity than

that above concluded from the model's water-displacement.

    Having decided upon its appearance at York in the approaching exhi-

bition of objects of scientific interest, formed to assist the British Asso-
ciation in celebrating in that city its fiftieth annual meeting, the Board of

Directors of the North-Eastern Railway Company appointed a Committee

to arrange for the immediate section and analysis of the aerolite. An

angle was sawn oS" from the back by a skilled lapidary, weighing about
50 grammes, and large enough to afford a thin microscopic section, which

was produced ; and the resulting fragments of the operation were, after
some unavoidable delays, placed with the microscopic section in the hands
of the Keeper, Mr. Fletcher, and the mineralogists, Dr. Walter Flight
and Mr. T. Davies, of the Mineralogical Department of the British
Miisenm, as presents from its possessors of original fragments of the

stone to the National Collection, and for ultimate examination and

analysis.

The interior of the Middlesbrough aerolite exhibits a perfectly uniform

strncture and greyish-white appearance, spangled with frequent metallic

Airon-grains and crystals of iron -sulphide.  few isolated spherules of

white homogeneous material, apparently identical with the cementing

substance of the mass, and as large as hemp-seeds, occur at intervals, but

these well-formed 'chondra,' as they are termed, appear in this aerolite

to be rather large than very plentiful.

     Round some of the iron-grains oxidation has caused rnsset-brown

coloration of the neighbouring white mineral, in spots with which the

sawn face and broken surfaces are all pretty freely speckled over. The

ground-mass itself is a fine-grained assemblage of nearly colourless

crystals cohering together pretty firmly with little intervening paste.

Under the microscope a few of the larger crystals are clear and trans-

parent, while the general aggregation of the finer ones is confused and

turbid.^ In some compactor areas, which may be paste or spherule-

sections, tangled dendritic markings (perhaps indicative of the presence of
manganese) spread from centres apparently of iron-gi-ains, and by their

arborescence and coralline appearance recall the recently published an-
nouncements by Dr. Hahn, of his microscopical observations of fossil

forms and vestiges of organisations in the spherules of aerolites. The

analysis of the Middlesbrough aerolite, which has not yet been executed,

Avill be particularly interesting if it reveals in the metallic substance

traces of manganese, and also if it succeeds in identifying tlie kind of
silicate of which the stony substance of the meteorite seems to be almost
unifoi'mly composed. The substance in powder, as was ascertained with

a very small trial of its dust, phosphoresces pretty brightly by heat when
thrown on a hot iron in the dark. As this property of phosphorescent
minerals, it is known, can only be restored to them after its loss by heat,
either by strong and long-continued insolation or by subjecting them to

strong electrical discharges, the question of the original habitat, and of

the original separation or ejection of meteoi-ites from foreign planets, .suns,

or comets will perhaps be narrowed in some measure by observations of

this property in other meteorites besides that of Middlesbrough, in some

of which the character of phosphorescence by heat may perhaps be shown

by trials to be equally distinct.

     Comparison with the Sales arid Kuleschowka stones shows a fair
resemblance in the mineral type and iron-dissemination -with the present
meteorite, but yet sufficient diversity of character to distinguish them
from each other very clearly. The solid massive Timoschin aerolite con-
sists largely of metallic ii'on, and that of Alais contains it only in fine
powdei' mixed with a clayey carbonaceous earth. The description of
outward appearance is, on the contrary, exactly accordant in the Kule-
Schowka and Middlesbrough aerolites, although they differ in weight and
size. The same low broad pyramid, or buckler-like figure, grotesquely
trenched and furrowed from the rounded summit outwards in front,

' like the forehead of a bony skull ; with a black polished surface there,
                                                                                                                                                                                         '

and dull brown crust upon the hollowed back ; these are features that tell
the meteorite's tale of a darting, smelting journey through the air with a
clearness and distinctness which it is rare to find typified so perfectly
among the known hundreds of museum specimens, as we find them shown
and illustrated in the Kuleschowka stone's description, and in the excel-
lent actual example of them which has now anew presented itself in the

Middlesbrough aerolite.' But it is unsafe to reason, even fi-om identical

chemical composition, on possible physical connection between their
courses, since such chemical identity has been pointed out by Daubree in

several instances of pairs of aerolites of such widely different dates of fall

that no assignable astronomical common origin can be traced or even
suspected to exist on that ground between them. The present aerolite

appears also to belong to the most usually occurring ordinary chondritic
class, although by simplicit}' of composition it will perhaps be found to

take rank among some of the more exceptional meteorites of that

description.

    At the time of the stone's fall the constellation Perseus was overhead,
and the small constellation Triangulum was a little south of the zenith at
Middlesbrough. Some cometary accordances with meteor-showers pro-
ceeding from that constellation in the first two weeks of March have been
rioticed, to which in connection with this aerolitic date attention may be

directed on account of the very near appulse which one of the comets'

orbits makes to the orbit of the earth.
     The comets are those of a.d. 1746, and a.d. 1231 ; the former

approaching the earth's orbit within about one-hundredth, and the latter

within about six-hundredths of the earth's distance from the sun, on
March 8 and 10 respectively. The showers of shooting-stars agreeing
pretty nearly with them were deduced by Mr. Denning from catalogues

of meteor observations by Weiss and Schiaparelli, and are well-marked,

     ' See A. Goebel's descriptions of Russian aerolites, Melanges Pkysvjucs et Chi-

miqitcs de L'Acacliniie Impmale de.St. Petershourg, vol. vii. pp. 286-288. Instances of

end-on erosion, denoting constant orientation of front- and rear-faces of aerolites in
their flight, occur also in some stones of Stannern, in one of L'Aigle, and in those of
Gross Divina and Goatpara, as first noticed by Von Haidinger (Vienna Academy Sitz-
ungsherichte, vol. xl. pp. 525-532, 1860, and xlv. p. 790, and lix.) ; in that of Durala
(India), depicted by Professor Maskelyne {PMlosopMcal Magazine, vol. xxv. p. 4i0,

1863) ; and finally in that of Karakol (in the Kirgis Steppe, May 9, 1840) as figured

by A. Goebel (loco sup. cit., jjp. 318-324). The last aerolite especially exhibits with
exceptional perfection, almost rivalling the anterior rotundity and grooving of the
Middlesbrough one, the blunt-pointed projectile configuration which denotes one-

sided action of the heat-erosion.

active showers. The meteorites of Segowlee, March 6, 1853, and Sagan
(Silesia), March 6, 1636, may perhaps belong, with the Middlesbrough
and other meteorites named above, to the same aerolitic systems, and the
directions of the courses of fireballs and shooting stars of the week from
March 8 to 14, and of meteorites should they again happen in that week,

will accordingly furnish very interesting materials for observation.

Note on a Preliminary Examination of the Middlesbrough Aerolite. By Mr,

   T. Davies, F.G.S. Communicated to the Committee, Aug. 30, 1881.

' I find that this aerolite bears a marked resemblance to the Kule-

schowka stone in the fine grained ash-grey base with a similar distribution

of the iron and the small rust-spots, which, however, are larger and more

frequent in the former. The spherules are also larger and more abundant.

Though belonging to the chondritic type of aerolites, I do not consider it

as markedly chondi'itic, many of the spherules not showing such a distinct

periphery in their section as wo aid allow of the stone being classed among

the more prominent instances of this group.

'With regard to its resemblance to the Kuleschowka aerolite, I find

that it is equally similar (macroscopically) to other aerolites of the same

type which bear very different dates of their descent ; notably those of

Milena, Croatia, April 26, 1842, Tourinnes la Grosse, Dec. 7, 1863, and

Girgenti,  Sicily, Feb.  10,  1853                          so  that I fear that no  theory founded on
                                                         ;

coincidence of date would be of much value [either as safe guidance in

searches for the evidence of a mineralogical resemblance, or as satis-

factorily confirming any such a resemblance].

' From microscopic examination I should regard the stone as consist-

ing very largely of enstatite, which exists not only in lai'ge isolated

crystals but also in groups of crystals, the olivine constituent (if any)

being  represented  by   the  finely                        crystalline  ground-mass                                                            but  this is  not
                                                                                                                                             ;

sufficiently distinct in the section to be determined by microscopic ex-

amination only.

     ' The " dendrites " of the spherules and enstatite crystals, are a mere
structural simulation of oi'ganisms, and are not due to manganese oxides,

which, if present, would be in sufficient quantity to be easily identified
chemically. All workers with the microscope are familiar with these

simulations.'

In last year's report it was stated that tlie factor tables for the fourth
and fifth millions had been published by Mr. James Glaisher, and that
the factor table for the sixth million was in the press. The printino-
and stereotyping of this million, the last of the three millions interven-
ing between the tables of Burckhardt and Dase, has been completed;
and the volume will be published shortly.

       II. Results of the Enumeration of the Primes in the Sixth Million.

     The following table contains the chief results of the enumeration of
the primes in the sixth million, arranged according to the numbers of

primes in the centuries.

     The next table shows the number of primes in each successive group
of 10,000 between 5,000,000 and G,000,000. Thus, for example, between
5,000,000 and 5,010,000 there are 639 primes, between 5,010,000 and
5,020,000 there are also 639 primes, between 5,020,000 and 5,030,000
there are 658 primes, and so on.

were given on pp. 49 and 33 of the Reports for 1879 and 1880 respec-

tively.

  III. Results of the Enumeration of the Primes in the First Nine Millions.

    As the gap between Burckhardt's and Dase's tables is now completely

filled up, it is possible to give results derived from an enumeration of
primes extending without break over the first nine millions.

     The following table (which is similar in arrangement to th.e first
table in Section II.), shows the number of centuries in each of the nine
millions which contain no prime, one prime, &c. The number at the
foot of each column is the number of primes in the million.

The Committee had hoped in this, the seventh year of its existence, to

have  completed                         the inquiry  with  which it        was  entrusted                                              but,  owing

partly to the considerable development of works to obtain water from

underground sources at the present time, and partly from the absence

from England of some of its members, it has been found necessary to

defer the final report on the water-bearing capabilities of the Triassic

and Jurassic formations of England and "Wales until next year, when the

Committee also hope to present their first report on the nature of the

quantity and the quality of the other permeable formations of the country.

From the investigations that have been made as to the capacity of

the Magnesian Limestone for absorption, it appears that 10 inches of

rainfall is annually available in this formation, or 400,000 gallons daily

per square mile, giving a total of 73 million gallons, or a supply for a

population of 2^ millions, at 30 gallons per head.

In the Oolitic area, probably not more than 5 inches annually can be

relied on, or 200,000 gallons per square mile, or a supply sufficient for

Ij million people, the total underground being capable of supplying

3^ millions of people.

     The actual population in this group of river-basins is under 1,400,000,
so that the supply in the area from these formations alone is more than

double the demand.

The Triassic rocks in this area are not available for water-supply, on

a larger  scale                         for  though certain wells  of  no  great      depth,  or importance,

obtain fresh WateV, the deep borirlgs of Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughans, and

Messrs. Bell Brothers, prove the existence of rock-salt in this formation,

which renders it,, valueless for water-snpply purposes.

      Professor G. A. Lebour states, for water-supply purposes it does not
appear necessary to notice any of the subdivisions generally recognised in
the Magnesian Limestone above the marl slate.

     The following is the series, divided in such a way as appears useful for

the purposes of the Committee :
      1. Yellow Sands : Generally a loose, incoherent, coarse sand with
            more or less calcareous cement, often concretionary, sometimes
            solid. Very irregular in thickness, from 60 feet downwards, and
            sometimes absent. Generally with a large amount of water.
     2. Magnesian Limestone : Similar to No. 4, seldom more than a few

            horizon, seldom more than a yard in thickness, generally imper-
            vious calcareous and sandy shale, often forming a fish-bed.
     4. Magnesian Limestone : Concretionary, brecciated, compact, and
            cellular, fossiliferous and nnfossiliferons, soft, and earthy in places,
            eminently hard and crystalline in others.

     Red Sandstone (with coal-plants) : Of Upper Coal-measure age.

    Professor Lebour has pi'epared a map of the Durham Coal-field on

which the out-crop of the Permian series is shown, as well as the position
of all siokings and borings that have been put through the Permian to
the Coal-measures, giving the thickness of the Yellow Sand and (where
known) the yield of water of that division and of the overlying beds.

     Of these areas the Magnesian Limestone would afford -water for a

population of nearly 2 millions.

    The New Red area consists largely of Keuper Marls overlying Triassic

Sandstones, but the area of absorption is limited to the outcrop of the

Sandstone only, the water absorbed by which passes down the dip under
the Marls. The available area is about 200 square miles, absorbing daily

8 million gallons, or a supply for a population of 2|- millions.

     The Oolites, at 5 inches of annual percolation, could supply about

1 million gallons.

     The population in this group of river-basins amounts to nearly
3 millions, requiring a supply of 90 millions of gallons of water daily.

     It has been thought desirable to recapitulate the facts obtained re-
garding the conditions of underground water-supply in the district of York.

The basin of the Humber may be divided geologically into four divisions,

all of -which strike magnetic north and south, or a little west of north.
The western belt consists of the Yorkshire coal-field, dipping east towards
the German Ocean, and overlain unconformabiy by the second belt, con-
sisting of the Permian and Trias, in which are no less than two uncon-
formities, the Bunter overlapping the Permians, and the Keuper the

Bunter.
312 EEPOKT-- 1881.

The Oolites constitute the third belt and tlie Cretaceous rocks the

fourth. The overlap at the base of the latter is so great that between

Market Weigh ton and the Derwent, south, of Malton, the Cretaceous rests

directly on the Lias, and the Oolites form no part of the surface of the

ground between those points.

In the west, the Hiimher hasin is bounded by the great Pennine

watershed,  traversing  England from  noi'th to south                                                                    to the south it is
                                                                                                                      ;

limited by the remarkable watershed which, traversing England diago-

nally, practically separates all the rocks below the Lias from those above

it. To the north, it is terminated by the east and west watershed,

crossing England from St. Bees' Head to Robin Hood Bay, north of

Scarboi'ough.

The Pebble Beds of the New Red Sandstone have been bored into at

various points, between Nottingham, Retford, and Selby, and are directly

overlain by the Keuper Waterstones, the Upper Mottled Sandstone and

Keuper conglomerate being alike absent.

North of Selby the Pebble Beds also have thinned out, and the Keuper

"Waterstones and the Lower Mottled Sandstone are alone available for

underground water-supply in the plains of York.

The Selby waterworks yield a water of 8 deg. of hardness, 250,000

gallons per day rising from a 6-inch hole 330 feet deep, to a height of

4 feet from the surface, or 16 feet above mean-tide level. The upper

portion of the boring consists of Warp-clay and silt, the lower 262^ feet

of Red Sandstone.

Borings at York, 104 feet deep, and at Market Weighton, 300 feet,

did not penetrate the Keuper marls.

    No water was met with in the Keuper marls in this boi'ing, nor were

any brine or rock-salt beds reached. In a boring a few miles to the
east, at Preesal, on the east side of the River Wyre, a boring carried into
these marls had intercepted a bed of rock-salt more than 100 feet in
thickness, on the surface of which brine rested. The surface of th.e

ground is about 40 feet above the Ordnance datum-line.
     In last year's Report details of a boring at Mr. Hull's brewery at

Preston were given, the depth being 246 feet ; the rock, pebble-beds, of

the New Red Sandstone, the water rising to 65 feet above the Ordnance

datum.

    Dr. Brown states, ' This water contains a large quantity of mineral

salts, especially of hardening salts. It will not be economical for washing
purposes ; but it is free from organic contamination, and is perfectly whole-
some for drinking purposes. Most deep well waters are hard, and at the
same time freer from organic matter than surface, or shallow well, water.'

General Methods of Obseeving and Mapping Spectka.

               By W. Marshall Watts, B.Sc.

The best method of measuring and mapping a spectrum must, of course,

depend on the object with which the spectrum is observed. If the

spectroscope is employed only as an auxiliary to the ordinary methods of

chemical analysis, and the object is simply to detei'mine the presence or
--absence of a metal of the alkalies or alkaline earths say lithium or
--calcium
         -very rough measurement only is needed                                                                                                                                                                                   indeed, in most cases,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the colour of the line or the general appearance of the spectrum is

sufficient. But if, on the other hand, the object is, for example, the

determination of the presence or absence of oxygen in the sun's

atmosphere, or the description of some new spectrum observed for the

first time, the case is altogether different ; the greatest dispersive power

that the circumstances of the case will allow must be employed, and

the position of each line must be measured with the utmost accuracy

attainable by the best use of the best apparatus at command.

The spectrum may, of course, be produced either by difiPraction from

a diffraction-grating or by refraction through a prism. The splendid

diffraction-gratings furnished by Rutherford give results unapproached

by any other means when the source of light is sufficiently powerful ; but
the intensity of a diffraction spectrum is always so much less than that

of a dispersion spectrum that for most purposes of spectroscopy the
prism must be employed.

     For the ordinary purposes of chemical analysis, nothing can be better
than a strongly-built spectroscope, provided with one prism of 60° of
dense glass, and a photograph-millimetre scale, seen by reflection at the

first surface of the prism.

It is not possible to construct instruments with exa,ctly similar scales,

and each instrument should therefore have its readings reduced to wave-

lengths by the method of graphical interpolation, to be presently

described                                                      but it is convenient to  have  these  reflected scales as                                                                                                          nearly as
                                                            ;

the Fraunhofer lines have the following positions :

318 KEPOET-- 1881.

     The brass mounting in whicli the scale is placed is always so made as
to admit of movement horizontally, so that any division of the scale may
be adjusted to any given line. The adjustment for the Bunsen scale

is made by bringing the sodium line to 50 of the scale, the image of that
edge of the slit which does not move when the breadth of the slit is

altered being made to coincide exactly with the division 50. If this

be on the left hand of the observer, then always the position of the

left-hand edge of each line and band is to be observed, and in the case

of a faint line the slit may be opened to admit more light, and yet an

accurate reading raay be obtained. This refers, of course, only to lines

which are sharply defined, and not to bands of considerable breadth.

The most convenient plan in making a map of an ordinary spectrum

is first to put down, as exactly as possible, the positions of the well-defined

lines on an ordinary lithographed millimetre scale, opening and closing

the slit as convenient, and then to go over the woi'k again, keeping the

slit at one uniform width and noting the relative intensity of the lines

and the width and character of the bands, whether sharply defined at the

edges, or sharp at the one edge and fading away at the other, or bright

in the middle and fading away at each edge. There is no better plan

of noting the peculiarities of a spectrum than that employed by Bunsen,

in which each bright line is represented by a black mark on the paper,

whose height represents the intensity of the line.

   A convenient modification of the scale used with the spectroscope for

ordinary purposes has been proposed by Professor Emerson Reynolds.^

The observing telescope cai-ries cross wires, and as it moves from one line

to another it causes an index-finger to travel round over a divided arc

on a plate of opal glass, which is feebly illuminated bj'^ a small flame.

The positions of the more important lines of the elements, whose spectra

are easily obtained with the Bunsen flame, are marked on the opal plate

the identification of any particular element is thus made without moving

the head away from the eyepiece of the instrument.

Very beautiful drav.ings of many of the ordinaiy spectra are given

in Lecoq de Boisbaudran's ' Spectres Lumineux.' The means of ignition

employed in producing these spectra were (1) the ordinary Bunsen flame,

(2) the spark from an induction coil (without a Leyden jar) striking on

the surface of the solution of the substance to be examined, (3) the spark

impinging on the surface of the fused salt, (4) the spai'k between metallic

"wires. In some cases, the gas feeding the Bunsen burner was charged

with hydrochloric acid gas, by making the gas pass through a flask

containing a warm solution of hydrochloric acid. The spectra drawn

      It is necessary that the indications of each spectroscope should be

reduced to the common scale of wave-lengths, if the results obtained are

to be compared with those obtained with other spectroscopes : but for the
mere purpose of identifying an alkali or an alkaline earth it is not necessary
to go beyond the scale of the spectroscope itself. Photographed scales,

giving the positions of lines directly in wave-lengths, to be used instead

of the ordinary scale of equal parts, have been constructed,^ but for

accurate work it is much the best to employ a scale of equal parts, and

to effect the reduction of wave-lengths separately.

     It is not very often that any other means of ignition than the Bnnsen
flame is employed when the spectroscope is simply used as an addition
to the ordinary means of chemical analysis. The employment of a higher
temperature, however, much extends its range even for such purposes,
and at the same time increases the difficulty of identification, and neces-
sitates more exact measurements.

   A small induction coil, actuated most conveniently by some form of

--battery, such as the Bichromate cell, which can be kept always ready,^

and a small Leyden jar the inside coating connected by an insulated
wire with the one terminal of the coil, and the outside coating with the

--other furnish a spark of the necessary intensity. If platinum wires

are employed as poles, it is important that fresh wires should be taken
each time, since wires which have been used for any particular metal

often continue to give the lines of that metal with great persistency.
     Bunsen^ recommends as poles little cones of pure porous carbon,

impregnated with a solution of the substance under examination.

A further^ difficulty in the employment of the spark with the spectroscope

for the ordinary purposes of chemical analysis arises from the constant

presence of the air-spectrum. It is necessary, therefore, to carefully map

the spectrum of air^ as obtained with the coil and spectroscope, which
are to be employed, say, first with platinum wires and then with silver

wires as poles. In each case the brightest lines will be those due to air,
with the addition in the one case of the fine lines of platinum, and in the
other of those of silver. The fine lines given by the less volatile metals
are often easily distinguished from those of air by the fact that they often
extend only a short distance from each pole, and do not reach across the
whole breadth of the spectrum, while those of air are of equal width across
the whole breadth of the spectrum.

     The air-lines are fainter when no jar is employed, so that with
the more volatile metals it is easier to work with the coil without a
Leyden jar.

The best map of the bright lines of the metals is that of Thalen ' (upon

the scale of wave-lengths), who, however, has employed poles of the metals

themselves and higher coil-power than is likely to be used in ordinary

laboratory work.

Other modes of ignition, which, however, will be employed for the

most part only for special researches, are furnished by the oxy-hydrogen
blowpipe and by the electric arc. The differences in the spectra obtained

by employing these different methods of ignition may be shortly accounted

--for by the different temperature to which the substance is heated at

low temperatures the spectra of compounds are obtained which at higber

temperatures are resolved into their elements. The Bunsen flame gives

the lowest temperature, the oxy-hydrogen flame next, then the spark from

a small coil without a Leyden jar ; then comes the electric arc, the tem-

perature of  which increases  with the number of cells                      employed                                              then the

which is increased up to the highest point obtainable by increasing the

size of the coil and jar employed.

The following list of lines will be found useful in constructing the

curve of wave lengtbs for a one-prism spectroscope. The wave-lengths

are given in tenth-metres ^ (or ten-millionths of a millimetre) ; there is
also given the approximate position of the line on Bunsen's scale, and the

reciprocal of the wave-length, or ' oscillation-frequency ' I.e. the number
of waves in one millimetre. There are many advantages in using these

' frequencies ' instead of the wave-lengths themselves, as will be after-

wards explained.

If the observer is not familiar with the Fraunhofer hnes, oi has diffi-

culty in recognising the particular bright lines of the metals given in the

preceding list, the following plan is recommended : First observe accurately

the positions of the lines of the ' flame spectra ' given, and from these

construct an interpolation-curve ; then mark on the curve the wave-lengths

of the Fraunhofer lines, and so determine their' positions approximately on

the scale of the spectroscope. On directing the instrument to the sun or

to a bright cloud| the Fraunhofer lines will certainly be found at or near

Nowthese positions.  let these Fraunhofer lines be read off as exactly as

possible, and from their positions, and those of the lines of the flame-

spectra, let a more accurate interpolation- cnrve be drawn, and let this curve

be used to find the positions of the lines of the spark-spectra. The final

curve should be drawn when the positions of these spark-lines have been

carefully observed. If it is not convenient to make use of the spark-

spectra, a very fair curve may be constructed from the lines of the flame-

spectra and from the Fraunhofer lines, but a little trouble in obtaining as

accurate a curve as possible will be well repaid. As a sample of what
may be done with a one-prism spectroscope and reflected scale, the follow-

ing numbers, taken from Lecoq de Boisbaudran, for the wave-lengths of

bismuth lines, are compared with Thalen's numbers .-

--then be adjusted till some lines in the green say h in the solar spectram

are in accurate focus. The instrument is then in adjustment.' When

used on the red or blue portion of the spectrum, the focus may be adjusted

with the observing telescope, but the collimator should not be altered.

It is necessary that the ray to be measured should be in exact focus

together with the cross-wires. If this is not the case, the ray will alter

its position slightly with reference to the cross-wires, if the eye be

slightly moved. The adjustment may therefore be tested by moving the eye
slightly and observing whether the ray and the cross- wires move together.

There is also a slight movement of the rays consequent on lateral shifting
of the source of light ; this is less the narrower the slit is, and the more

distant the source of light is.

   --Some instruments are provided with a tangent-sci-ew micrometer,

that is, a long screw, the head of which is divided into a hundred

equal parts, by means of which a slow motion can be given to the observ-

ing telescope, and the number of turns of the screws, and parts of a turn

necessary to carry the cross-wires from one line to another, is noted.

In the bright-line micrometer^ the image of a fine slit in a brass

plate is seen by reflexion at the first surface of the prism, and so is super-

posed upon the spectrum                                                                                                                  the plate and slit have a slow motion given                     by
                                                                                                                                      ;

a micrometer screw. This form of micrometer is specially useful with

very faint spectra, when cross-wires would be useless. In observing

with cross-wires a luminous spectrum the lines of which are faint, it is

necessary to admit a certain amount of light into the observing telescope,

sufficient to illuminate the wires (conveniently by raising an edge of the

cloth used to cover up the prisms). This general light renders very faint

lines invisible. In all these methods of consecutive coincidences it is neces-

sary that no shifting of the parts of the instrument by bending or shaking,

nor any disturbance of the position of the source of light, nor of the exact

position of the eye, should take place during the passage of the cross-

wires from one line to the next. In the methods of ' simultaneous coin-
cidences ' all these sources of error are avoided by observing at the same

--instant two lines one a known line, used as a reference line, and the

other the line to be measured.

     The method of the reflected photographed scale, already described at

some length, may be employed as a method of simultaneous coincidences,

and so made more exact if, when the reading of any line is noted, care

be taken to observe that the sodium-line is still exactly at 50 ; or if the

sodium-line is not in the field, then that some other line used as reference

line is exactly in its right position at the moment of observation.
     The most accurate measuring instrument for use with large spectro-

sco])es is the bifilar micrometer eyepiece. This is an eyepiece similar

to those employed for astronomical purposes, provided with two crosses of

fine spider-lines in the focus of the eyepiece, which must therefore be of

the line to be measured and a line of known wave-length can thus be

determined with great precision. In taking an observation, a slight
motion is given to the fixed cross-wires by means of the slow motion or

eyepiece being at. the same time adjusted by the other hand, till the

observer is satisfied that each line is truly coincident with the intersec-

tion of the corresponding spider-lines.

Another device for measuring the interval between two lines, quite

equal in accuracy to the bifilar micrometer, is that of the divided-lens

micrometer.^ In this instrument the micrometer screw moves one-

half of a lens placed just in front of the prisms, and divided along a
horizontal diameter. The effect is to cause one-half of the spectrum to

move along under the other half, and the sodium or any other conve-

nient line is used as a substitute for the cross-wires, and is brought into

coincidence with each of the lines to be measured. It will be seen that

the necessity of admitting extraneous light to illuminate cross- wires is

avoided, and this instrument can therefore be used in faint spectra with

precision.

     The photographic method is, of course, a method of simultaneous
coincidences, inasmuch as the positions of the known lines which are

employed as reference lines are recorded at the same instant as those of
the unknown lines.

    The bifilar or the divided-lens micrometer may have fitted to it a

device for mapping the spectrum at the same time that the positions of

the lines are measured. For this purpose the steel rod on which the

screw of the micrometer is cut is made about three times as long, and the

extra length has cut on it a much coarser thread. On this there travels
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,

A'the length of stroke of the tracing point.  bright line would then be

denoted by a long trace, and a weak line by a short one. The same
instrument might easily be made available for measuring the positions of

'the lines in the photograph of a spectrum, since, of course, to take a

photograph of a mass of lines in a spectrum is not to have measured the

wave-length of these lines, or to have determined their chemical origin.

   --Another instrument very useful in measuring photographed spectra,
--·or in drawing maps of spectra from measurements is Beckley's spectro-

graph. This consists of a brass cylinder, on which the photograph is

stretched, and the edge of the cylinder is graduated and provided Avith a

vernier. There is also a straight edge, which can be brought down upon
the photograph parallel to the lines of the spectrum. Each line in suc-

cession is brought up to the straight edge, and the position of the cylinder

is read off by means of the vernier. The instrument is generally gra-

duated into degrees and minutes, but it is desirable that it should carry

also (on the other edge) a division into millimetres, the vernier reading

to the tenth of a millimetre. The accuracy of reading is increased by

substituting for the straight edge a small microscope with a 3-inch ob-

jective, and with cross-wires in the eyepiece.

    We have already remarked the necessity of reducing the numbers

--by whatever instrument obtained to a uniform scale.

The scale to be employed must be applicable to all spectroscopes

alike, and must be independent of the peculiar construction of the instru-

dispersive power of the material of which they are made, of variations in

the temperature, and of all other disturbing causes. It is clear that in

such a method each line can be mapped only by means of its colour, that

is  to  say, by the length of the wave of  light   hj which  it  is  produced
                                                                                                                  ;

and a spectrum so represented must be such a one as is produced by dif-

fraction, and not by dispersion. Dispersion-spectra obtained by the use

of prisms of different materials vary greatly in the relative breadth of

the colours, so that in mapping a spectrum it, is by no means sufficient

to give the positions of only two or three lines as points of reference.

Many otherwise valuable observations of spectra are entirely useless from

the insufficient number of reference lines observed.

    Three spectroscopes (each with a single prism and reflected scale),

constructed by Duboscq and intended to be exactly alike, differed as shown

in the following table. The numbers show the difficulty of constructing

two instruments with exactly similar scales :

of tlie measurements, since the wave-lengths of all lines are not known

with equal accuracy.

If the wave-lengths are to be determined accurately to five figures,

it is desirable to use as reference lines those only which are found in

Angstrom's map, or in the B. A. map of oscillation-frequencies.

    The wave-length of the line to be measured may be calculated from
those of two known lines between which it falls by means of the formula :

         -- -- --Aa 2>.
                                ^3 ·'^1  ·
                       71, n.

where n^ and n^ are the readings on the scale of the spectroscope of

the two known lines, As and Xj their wave-lengths, n^ the reading of the

line to be measured, and X2 its wave-length. It is desirable that the two

known lines should be as close to the one to be measured as possible
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

when sufiiciently close the above formula gives the same result as a simple

proportion.

     To give an idea of the accuracy of the results obtainable by use of the
above formula we may suppose the problem to be to determine the wave-

length of a certain strontium line from the wave-lengths of the following
three pairs of lines between which it lies. The actual wave-length of the
line in question, as given by Thalen (corrected), is 5533'64. The scale-

readings are Kirchhoffs :--

Case 1.  w, = 1274"2   A., = 5534-21     Here the formula and simple pro-
                       \, = 5531-77
         7U = 1274'7                       portion both give A.,, = 5533-60.
         wj = 1276-2

Case 2.  w, = 1268-0   A, = 5542-10      The formula gives 553400, and a
         «., = 1274-7  A3 = 5526-05         simple proportion gives 5534-01.
         «3 = 1281-3

Case 3.  n, = 1242-6   X, = 5571-82      Here the formula gives 5533-82,
         n,, = 1274*7  \, = 5496-74         and a simple proportion
         nl = 1306-7
                                             5534-22.

But a far more convenient plan, and one quite equal to the above in

accuracy, is that of graphical interpolation, which has also the great

advantage of enabling us to detect at once any reading inconsistent with

the rest, so giving the best mean result of all the observations.

   A scale of wave-lengths is marked off along one edge of a sheet of

paper ruled into squares (inches and tenths or millimetres), and the edge

at right angles to this has a scale marked on it corresponding to the scale

of the instrument. The positions of as many lines as can be ascertained

with precision ai'e mapped on the paper, and a smooth curve is then

drawn through all these points, or through as many as possible, and

having the rest as near the curves as possible, and as many above as

below. In this way one observation is corrected by another, and the

curve is more likely to give correct results than an iri-egular line made up

of manj' straight portions which -would pass through all of the points.
The position of a line to be measured being found on the carve, will have

opposite to it the wave-length sought. Various devices may be employed to

Afacilitate the drawing of the curve.  smooth thin steel rule, which can

be bent by the hands into the curve required, will be found useful. It

--requires, however, the co-operation of two persons one to hold the rule
                                                             Id

down on the paper (stretched on a drawing-board), and the other to rule

the curve with a finely pointed hard pencil. The author of this report

employs a little drawing instrument consisting of a steel bar, mounted on

a brass base which rests on the paper. By means of clamping-screws the

steel bar can be held bent in the required curve, whether of equal curvature

throughout its length, or more curved in one part than another.

   A somewhat different method of procedure is described in a paper by

Mr. Wm. Dodgson in the sixth volume of the third series of the ' Memoirs

of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.'

The best paper for the purpose is a paper ruled into millimetres and

centimetres made in rolls 69 centimetres broad, which may be obtained

through Messrs. Williams and Norgate, 14, Henrietta Street, Covent

Garden, or a somewhat similar paper to be obtained from Messrs.

Lechertier, Barbe and Co., of 60, Regent Street. These papers are more

uniform and free from shrinkage than any others. Another paper also

ruled in millimetres, in sheets 1 metre by 7 decimetres, is to be obtained

Afrom C. Dupressoir, Rue St. Honore, 175, Paris.                     paper, ruled in inches

and tenths, 24 inches by 15 inches, is to be obtained from Waterlow and

Sons, 60 and 61, London Wall, but it is hardly uniform enough for the

purpose. Some trouble expended in drawing a good curve will be very

well repaid. The line obtained in this way will generally be very much

curved, but the less curved it is the more easily is it drawn and the more

Aexactly can it be employed.                                         less curved line is obtained by using the

reciprocals of the wave-lengths instead of the wave-lengths themselves.'

The adoption of this scale of inverse wave-lengths or of oscillation-

frequencies is strongly recommended by a Committee of the British

Association, under whose superintendence a catalogue ^ of oscillation-

frequencies and a corresponding map of the Praunhofer lines have been

prepared. It is hoped that this catalogue will be extended to the bright

lines of metals not present in the sun's atmosphere.

The map of oscillation-frequencies is intermediate between a diffraction-

spectrum and a dispersion-spectrum, the red end being less extended when

compared with the blue end than in Angstrom's map, and more extended

Athan in Kirchhoff's.                                                map drawn to wave-lengths is too much dis-

torted to be advantageously employed with a dispersion-spectroscope, and,

on the other hand, a spectrum mapped with a dispersion-spectroscope

does not sufficiently resemble the same spectrum seen with a diffraction-

spectroscope                                                         but a map of oscillation-frequencies, being intermediate
                                                                  ;

between the two, is not so different from either but that it is suitable for

use both with diffraction-spectroscopes and with dispersion-spectroscopes.

Further rays which are harmonically related are represented in the map

of oscillation-frequencies by equidistant lines and in the catalogue by an

arithmetic series whose common difference is equal to its first term. The
map accompanying this report shows the scale of a one-prism spectroscope

reduced both to wave-lengths and to oscillation-frequencies. It will be

seen that the second line is much less curved than the first.

       If the squares of the reciprocals be employed the interpolation curve will be
very nearly (but only nearly) a straight line.

     In the foregoino^ list there are doubtless many inaccuracies and
omissions. Although some trouble has been taken to render the list

correct as far as it goes, yet it is certainly incomi^lete. It is requested

that anyone detecting errors will communicate with some member of the
Committee, forwarding the proper correction. The reliance that can be
placed on the list will best be indicated by a description of the method

employed in compiling it.
     The following periodicals were looked through : ' Philosophical

Transactions,' 'Proceedings of the Royal Society,' 'Philosophical Maga-
zine,' ' Journal of the Chemical Society,' ' Monthly Notices of the
Royal Astronomical Society,' 'Nature,' ' Comptes Rendus de I'Academie
des Sciences,' ' Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' ' Berichte der
Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft,' ' Annalen der Physik und Chemie,"
' Beiblfitter zu den Annalen der Physik und Chemie,' ' American
Journal of Science and Arts.' In many of these periodicals, abstracts
from others, and also references, were found ; the originals of
these were then sought and the titles entered in the list. Almost
all the references in the third column have been thus verified those

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

Interim Report of the Committee for constructing and issuing

   ·practical Standards for use in Electrical Measurevients, the
   Committee consisting of Professor G-. Carey Foster, Mr. C.
   HocKiN, Professor Sir William Thomson, Professor Ayrton,

   Mr. J. Perry, Professor W. G-. Adams, Lord Rayleigh, Professor

   F. Jenkin, Dr. 0. J. Lodge, Dr. John Hopkinson, Dr. Muirhead,

   JNIr. W. H. Preece, and Mr. Herbert Taylor.

                                                 [Plate VL]

It appeared to the Committee that in order to perform the task
entmsted to them, they had two principal questions to consider : First,

to select or prepare a well-defined standard of accurately known abso-

lute value for each kind of magnitude ; and, secondly, to take measures
for making certified copies of each of the adopted standards accessible to
the public.

     The standard magnitudes which the Committee have had under

consideration as yet are

     1. The Standard of Resistance.
     2. The Standard of Capacity.
     3. The Standard of Electromotive Force.
     As to the first of these, the standard of Resistance, the Committee
were of opinion that, in view of the discrepant results obtained by
experimenters who have re-examined the absolute resistance of the B. A.

unit, it might be well to reconsider the question whether the ' ohm '

should be defined by reference to a particular coil of wire preserved as a

concrete standard, or whether the term ' ohm ' should be understood to
mean a resistance of 10^ C. G. S. units. They were also of opinion that

it was desirable to continue the experimental investigation of the absolute

resistance of the existing standards.
--424
                           EEroiiT 1881.

The repetition of the determination with the original apparatus, by

Lord Rayleigh and Professor Schuster in the Cavendish Laboratory, has

gone far to supply this requirement. Experiments by another method have

also been carried on by Professor G. C. Foster in the Physical Laboratory

of University College, London. Some account of these experiments is

given in Appendix I. to this report, but the results hitherto obtained

can only be regarded as preliminary. With regard to the issue of
authorised cojoies of the ohm for general iise, the Committee did not see

their way to making arrangements for actual construction of standard

coils. They were of opinion that it would be best to limit their action to

drawing up a detailed specification for the construction of standard

resistance coils, and to arranging for the systematic testing of coils

which are certified to them as being made in accordance with this

specification, issuing certificates showing their actual resistance. Such a

system would be analogous to the system adopted by the Kew Committee
for the testing of meteorological instruments at the Kew Observatory,
It has not yet been settled by whom this duty should be undertaken.

    An important point of detail connected with the practical construction

and use of standard coils has been investigated by Mr. Herbert Taylor.

The material adopted by the former Committee for the wire of the

standards issued by them, was an alloy of platinum and silver, containing

one part platinum to two of silver ; and the same material is very often

used for the coils in the ' resistance-boxes ' issued by instrument-makers.

One sjaecial reason for the selection of this alloy for the purpose named is

--its small temperature-rate of variation of resistance, 0'031% per degree,

according to the late Dr. Matthiessen. Mr. Taylor has now found that

the rate of variation of resistance of wire made of this alloy depends upon

the diameter of the wire, the percentage amount for one degree varying

from 00299 for a wire nearly 7 millim. in diameter to 00231 for a

Awire of diameter 0*168 millim.  detailed account of Mr. Taylor's

experiments forms Appendix II. to this Report.

With regard to standards of GapacUy, the Committee are able, thanks

to the zealous co-operation of one of their number, to i-eport somewhat

more complete arrangements. Dr. Muirhead having undertaken for the

present to make and issue Standard Condensers adjusted in accordance

with one whose absolute capacity has been determined by himself and

Mr. Hockin. (' Brit. Assoc. Rep.,' 1879, pp. 283 and 285.)
    With a view to testing the permanency of condensers made with

mica, paraffined i^aper, or other solid insulators. Dr. Muirhead is also

having constructed a large air- condenser.

In reference to the standard of Electromotive Force, the Committee

have had to consider whether this ought to be based upon a particular

combination of chemicals, forming a galvanic cell of definite electromotive

force, such, for instance, as a Daniell's cell, constructed in a specified

manner from materials of guaranteed purity, or the cell introduced by

Mr. Latimer Clark (' Proc. Roy. Soc' xx. 444), or whether they should

not rather aim at the construction of some convenient form of electro-

meter capable of indicating with sufficient accuracy an electromotive force

of about a volt. The first plan would be comparable with a supply of

ice and boiling water as affording a standard interval of temperature ; the

second would be comparable with a thermometer showing the two limits

of the standard interval.

The Committee are not yet prepared to make a final recommendation
--

as to either metliod of embodying the standard electromotive force,
thougli tboy are strongly inclined to believe that an electrometer or
cauo-e, capable of showing Avhen a definite electromotive force has been
developed, by whatever means, will ultimately be found more satisfactory
than any system in which the constancy of an electromotive force is
inferred from the supposed constancy of the conditions under which it

has been developed.

    Another question of a more general kind, v/hich, though it may not
be of much immediate practical importance, will eventually have to be

carefully considered, has occupied the attention of the Committee to
some extent. It is the question as to what concrete standards should
finally be recognised as fundamental standards. Supposing that we
already had independent standards of Ji^eslstance, Gapacltij, Electromotive
Force, Quantity, and Current Strength; each of them defined with all the
accuracy that our present experimental methods admit of, they would

infallibly be found to exhibit small discrepancies when compared together.

For instance, the current of standard strength would not be exactly the
same as that produced by the standard electromotive force acting in the

circuit of the standard resistance, and we should then have to consider

·which of the three standards was to be corrected so as to bring it into
harmony with the other two.

     Similarly, in the case of the other electrical magnitudes. The known

relations between these are sufficient to enable us to define the unit of any
one of the five magnitudes jnst mentioned in terms of the units of any
two of the rest. Hence it appears that the electrical standards of
ultimate authority cannot be more than two in number, and it will have
to be decided which pair of concrete standards are to be recognised as
ultimate or fundamental, and what are to be left to be defined by

reference to them.

    A further question arising out of the mutual relations of the funda-

mental units was that of the magnitude of the practical units to which
distinctive names should be attached. The present usage with respect to

this matter is that a resistance of 10^ C.G.S units is called an Ohm ; an

electromotive force oi \Q)*^ C.G.S. units is called a FbZi ; and the current
produced by a Volt acting through an Ohm, that is to say, a current of
10* -f- 10^ or 0-1 C.G.S. unit is called a Weher. In the opinion of the
Committee it -was considered highly desirable, from a scientific point of

view, that the relations among these standards should be simplified by
defining them as follows :

             =Ohm 10^ C.G.S. units of resistance.
             =Volt 10^ C.G.S. units of electromotive force,
             =Weber 1 C.G.S. unit of current.

      It was felt, however, that any recommendation involving a change
in the value attached to terms which are rapidly coming into extensive
use among practical electricians, might give rise to serious inconvenience.
Therefore, although with regard to the scientific aspect of this proposal
the Committee were decidedly in favour of the change, they felt that a
public recommendation could not well be made until the practical incon-
veniences likely to follow had been very carefully investigated.

                           Appendix I.

Account of Preliminary Experiments on the Determination of Electrical

    Resistances in Ahsohite Measure. By Professor G. Caret Foster, F.E.S.

The experiments to be described in wliat follows were made in the

Physical Laboratory of University College, London. The principle of the

method employed is essentially the same as that of the method long ago

pointed out by Sir William Thomson, and adopted by the first Committee

of this Association upon Electrical Standards in their ex^^eriments of

1863 and 1864, as well as by Lord Rayleigh in the repetition of these ex-

periments recently carried out by him in conjunction with Professor

Schuster.

Every absolute measuremeiit of resistance is, by the natm-e of the

case, fundamentally the determination of the ratio of an electromotive

force to the strength of the current which it produces in the conductor

whose resistance is to be measured. In Sir William Thomson's method,

as is well known, the electromotive force is due to the action of the earth's

magnetism upon a coil of wire spinning about a vertical diameter, and its
numerical value is known from the rate at which the coil spins, the total

area enclosed by its windings, and the intensity of the horizontal com-

ponent of the earth's magnetism. The electromotive force generates a

current in the coil, the strength of which is known from the deflection of

a small magnet, hung at the centre of the coil, and from the intensity of

the earth's horizontal magnetic force. This last factor, entering similarly

into the expressions for the electromotive force and for the current,

disappears from their ratio, which gives in absolute measure the resistance

of the "wire forming the revolving coil.

    In the method now to be described there is again an electromotive

force generated in a revolving coil, just as in Sir William Thomson's

method, but the current is measured by an independent galvanometer,

           Fig. 1.         and the conductor, whose resistance
                           is given by the experiments, is en-

                           tirely distinct from the revolving coil.

                           So far as this method possesses any

                           particular advantages they arise frora

                           the circumstance last mentioned. The

                           conductor of which the resistance is

                           measured being at rest, it may be a

                           coil of wire of any material, wound

                           in whatever waj^ may bo most con-

                           venient and it may be immersed in
                                                                          ;

                           a bath of liquid so as to keep it at an

                           accurately known temperature. More-

                           over, several independent coils of

                           diiferent resistances can. be experi-

H[' '               \^ ^/     mented upon one after another, and

                           J the resistance of each determined.

                                    The nature of the method and the

                                                          arrangement of the essential parts of

the apparatus may be explained by help of the adjoining figure. In

this, R stands for the wire, of which the resistance is to be measured ; and
P for a thermopile whereby a current is produced through E and through a

tangent-galvanometer G. The ends of the wire of the revolving coil c are
          ON STAXDABDS FOR UfJE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUKEMENTS.                          427

connected, through a commutator K upou the axle, with the ends of the

wire R, a delicate reflecting galvanometer g, called in what follows the

sero-rjalvanometer, being interposed on one side of the commntator. When

the speed of the coll is so adjusted that the zero-galvanometer is not

deflected, the electi-omotive force developed in the coil by the magnetism

of the earth is equal to the electromotive force exerted by the thermopile

between the ends of the conductor r. Conseq^aently, the resistance of this

conductor is obtained in absolute measure by dividing the electromotive

force of the coil by the strength of the current indicated hy the tangent-

galvanometer.

This result may be expressed in terms of the experimental data, as

Afollows. Let  be the total area included by all the convolutions of the
--revolving coil that is, the sum of the areas included by all the turns

taken severally, H^ the horizontal magnetic intensity at the place occu-

pied by the coil, w the angular velocity of the coil, and 2c( the arc of

contact made by the commutator, then E, the electromotive force of the

coil, is

Again, if F is the strength of the magnetic field produced at the centre of
the tangent-galvanometer, where the needle is hung, by a current of unit

strength flowing through the galvanometer, H^ the horizontal intensity of

the earth's magnetic field at the same point, and B the deflection of the
galvanometer, the strength C of the current in the galvanometer, and

therefore also in the wire v., is

masses of iron, this condition was not fulfilled in the actual experiments.

The ratio iu question was accordingly determined by noting the time of

vibration of the same magnet when it was suspended alternately in the

position of the revolving coil and in that of the galvanometer respectively.

                                                                                                                  TT

frame in wliich it was mounted, were in the main copied from those used
in the experiments of the former Committee, but both riug and frame

were made considerably stouter in the metal, and the ring had only one

groove instead of two. The upper and lower halves were insulated from

each other, to prevent the formation of induced currents.

   =To determine the area A, we have A ««r/47r, where n is the

number of turns of wire on the coil and vi the circumference of the mean

the circumference of the groove in which the coil was wound, as well as

the circumference after each successive Inyer of wire had been put on.

The mean of all these measures, corrected for the thickness of the tajse,

about O'Ol cm., was taken as the value of m. In order to guard against

accidental error, the separate measurements of the circumference were

+ +combined in pairs, thus i/io i»,,, «ii «',,-i, . . . the suffixes denoting

several measurements were made ; these sums, which ought to be con-

being 32. In this way the circumference of the meaii layer was found

to be 96'669 cm. which gives for the area enclosed by it 743"G6 sq. cm.

The tangent-galvanometer had two equal parallel coils, of approxi-

mately square section, placed at a distance apart nearly equal to their

mean radius, which was about 18'25 cm. Bach coil consisted of 22 layers

of 20 turns each ; the galvanometer had thus altogether 880 turns of
wire. The needle consisted of three short bits of hardened and magnetised

watch-spring, fastened one above another at the back of a light plane-

glass mirror. The deflections were read upon a straight glass scale,

divided at the back into millimetres. The distance from mirror to scale

was  137"25  cm.,  of  which  about  "45  cm.  was  occupied  by  glass                           the

value of r was thus found to be 1/0-004618, so that the absolute

strength of a current measured upon this galvanometer is

                              H0-004618 tan 8.

The commutator of the revolving coil consisted of a cylindrical piece of
ivory about 7'6 cm. in diameter, with two pieces of platinum let in upon
opposite sides. One end of the wire was fastened to one of these platinum
pieces and the other end to the other piece ; and contact with the external
ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS.  429

circnit was made tlirougla two platinnm- faced gun-metal wheels, each
about 15 cm. diameter, which revolved in contact with the ivory cylinder.
The wheels revolved in insulated bearings about vertical axes, nearly in
the same plane as the axis of rotation of the coil. The tipper end of the
axle of each wheel carried a small copper mercury-cup into which a well-

amalgamated copper wire dipped for connecting the coil with the end of
the wire R (see figure), of which the resistance was to be measured. This
arrangement was adopted in order to avoid the heating, and consequent
thermo-electric action, which w^ould probably have resulted from the use

of rubbing contacts. It was found very efficient for this purpose.

      In order to avoid as far as possible the effects of self-induction in
the revolving coil, the platinum contact-pieces had an angular breadth of
only about 20 degrees, so that the coil was in metallic connection with the

rest of the circuit during only about ^th of each revolution. By adjusting

the contact-wheels so that the vertical plane containing their axes coincided

with the magnetic meridian, the middle of the period of contact was made
to coincide with the instant of maximum intensity and minimum rate of
variation of the electromotive force in the coil. The arc of contact

actually employed was 20° 3', which gives for the ratio of the maximum
and minimum electromotive force due to the earth's magnetism the value

1 : 0'98l7, or an extreme variation of less than 2 per cent.

      Putting together the values of the constant factors in the expression

for the resistance to be determined, we get

leaving T, the period of rotation of the coil, and d, the deflection of the

tangent-galvanometer, to be observed in each experiment.

     To determine the speed of the coil, the following method was adopted.
Three glass pens, each controlled by a small electro-magnet, were caused
to mark side by side upon a strip of paper drawn forward by clockwork,
as in an ordinary Morse receiver. The pens, when left to themselves,
ruled parallel straight lines on the paper, but when any of the electro-
magnets was excited, the corresponding pen was pulled to one side and

a notch was made in the line the pen was drawing. By means of a

wheel of 100 teeth, cari-ying a pin which made contact with a light
spring once in every revolution, and gearing into a screw cut upon

the upper part of the axle of the coil, the circuit of one of the
electro-magnets was completed for an instant at every hundredth

revolution of the coil, and an indentation was made in the corresponding-
line. The circuit of the second electro-magnet was broken for an instant
by a clock at intervals of one second, thus making notches on the second
line. By afterwards measuring the distances between the notches on
the two Hues, the speed with which the coil was spinning at any
instant could be ascertained. This measui-ement was made by laying

over the paper a strip of glass divided on its lower surface into centi-
metres and millimetres. The degree of accuracy attainable in this way,
independently of error of the clock, was about one pai-t in one thousand.
The speeds used in the experiments varied from about nine to about
twelve revolutions per second. The electro-magnet acting on the third

pen was under the control of an observer who watched the zero-galva-
nometer (g in the figure,) and held down a contact-key, which completed

the corresponding circuit whenever and as long as this galvanometer
                                                --

showed no deflection. In this way the third line on the recording strip
was displaced to one side whenever the speed was such as to cause the

electromotive force of the coil and that due to the thermo-electric pile

accurately to balance each other, and thus the parts which were to be
Ameasured of the other two lines were indicated.
                                                    second observer noted

the reading of the tangent-galvanometer when the zero galvanometer

was undeflected., and thus determined the angle 0.

    It is evident, from the formula given above, that the product T tan d

should be constant in all experiments in which the wire whose resistance
was to be determined was the same. The amount of agreement in the

value of this product in different experiments therefore affords a criterion

of the consistency of the results with each other. The results obtained

in two series of experiments were as follows :

It will be seen that the second set of values agree better together than

the first set. This is probably chiefly due to greater practice in observing,
and to the adoption of an artifice whereby the speed of the gas engine
employed to drive the coil was kept more constant. In calculating the

final result from each set, weight was given to each separate observation
in proportion to the square of the number of revolutions of the coil over

which it extended ; for it was assumed that the accuracy with which the
speed of the coil was determined was proportional to the number of
revolutions included in the record ; moreover, the number of galvanometer-
readings obtained in each experiment was proportional also to the number

of revolutions, and hence it was assumed that the accuracy with which

the product was determined was proportional to the square of the number

of revolutions. The weighted means thus calculated are, for the

at which they were adjasted, we get for the nominal values

               = =pi 73*16 ohms and p^ 80"18 ohms.

I do not attach any particular importance to these values, or to the

close agreement of their mean with the intended value of the ohm, as the

experiments, so far, have only been undertaken with the view of

ascertaining how far the method that has been described is capable,

when employed under favourable circumstances, of giving good results.
In this respect I think tlie experiments may be considered fairly satis-
factory, but the numbers obtained for the value of the ohm are subject

to several corrections, the most important of which are probably that for

errors of the clock, which I had no means of rating more accurately

kinds, important practical suggestions as to the construction of the

apparatus, information as to the conditions required in order to ensure

sensitiveness, and the loan, for a long time, of a very delicate zero-

galvanometer and a set of resistance coils. I am also greatly indebted
to Mr. Grant and Mr. G. W. von Tunzelraann, B.Sc, by whom conjointly

the actual observations were almost entirely made.

      On the Causes of the Variation in the Temperature-Coefficient of the
          Alloys of Flatinum and Silver. By Herbert Taylor, Esq.

      In his report to the Committee of the British Association in 1862
Dr. Matthiessen proposed for the construction of standard resistance

coils the now widely-used alloj^ of silver and platinum, consisting of
two parts of silver and one part of platinum by weight. In the same
paper he gave the specific conducting power of the material and also its

percentage-variation in resistance due to a change of temperature of 1°

centigrade.

     The latter value, called the temperature-coefiicient in what follows,
he stated to be 0-031% per degree.

     It was, however, found, after the alloy came into general use, that the
temperature-coefiicient varied within moderately wide limits.

    And it was noticed, by the writer amongst others, that having

determined by experiment the coefficient of a particular wire, it was
necessary to make a fresh determination for the same wire when drawn

down to a finer gauge.
432 EEPOET-- 1881.

    An investigation into tLe causes of these variations was therefore

desirable ; and at the request of your Committee it has been undertaken
by myself. As yet, no very definite result has been reached, but the

observations already made, involving much care and a very large ex-
penditure of time, and the method of experimenting employed, may

perhaps be worth recordiug.
     I should here say that thi-oughout the investigation I have had the

benefit of the co-operation of Mr. Charles Hoekin, by whom many of the

observations were made.
     To better observe the variation in the temperature-coefficient with

change of diameter, rods of considerable sectional area, to be afterwards

drawn into wire, Avere obtained from Messrs. Johnson & ]\latthey.

     The first rod (called hereafter Bar A) was of the commercial alloy
manufactured specially for electrical purposes ; the metals used are
commercially pure, and are melted together in large quantities. The
alloy is then cast as a flat ingot, not more than an inch or an inch and a
half in depth, and this ingot is next rolled into a large sheet about 0'3
inch thick, which is cut by shears into narrow strips.

     These strips are finally passed between grooved rollers, to give them
an approximately circular section, and the rods thus formed are ready for
the draw plates to reduce them to wii'e of the required diameter.

     The bar experimented on was, in the ' rod ' stage, abotit 8 inches long,

and 2 7 inch in diameter.
     The second rod (called hereafter Bar B) was specially made for these

experiments of pure materials, by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey.

    It was cast in the form of a bar, about 8 inches long. On leaving

the mould it was about 0"3 inch square, slightly tapering, and more or
less irregular in section, but was reduced in the lathe and by filing to a
section almost absolutely square and uniform.

   --The third rod (called Bar C) was of an alloy made by the same firm

for the use of dentists the method of casting and rolling being the
same as that described for the electrical alloy, but rather less attention is

paid to the purity of the components.
     It was procured in the form of a narrow strip, about a quarter of an

inch thick, and reduced to a uniform square section by the lathe and file.
     As it was necessary to observe accurately the small percentage-

variation, due to change of temperature, in the resistance of these bars,
which was itself exceedingly minute, I'ecourse was had to the method of
observation originally proposed by Mr. C. Hoekin, and described and
figured in Clerk Maxwell's ' Electricity and Magnetism,' pp. 406 and
407, vol. 1, by means of which the unavoidable resistance of the con-

nections can be altogether eliminated.

     Instead, however, of using, as shown in the figure referred to, a

comparative'iy short wire, with resistance-bobbins at its ends, a wire

40 feet in length, wound on a cylinder, was employed, so that the bobbins

could be dispensed with, without loss of accuracy, and with a great gain
in simplicity of calculation and in range.

     To avoid the very great expense of a necessarily thick wire of iridio-
platinum, which was, however, recognised to be the best matei'ial, a
german-silver wire was in the first instance fitted to the cylinder and
calibrated, but after a short time it was found to get loose in its groove,
 so that the readings obtained on it could not be depended on.

    A platinum-silver wire was next tried, and though most carefully

drawn, the calibration showed such a want of uniformity in the con-

ducting power at different parts of its length that it was at once

discarded.

Finally, an iridio-platinum wire was obtained from Messrs. Johnson

and Matthey, fitted to the cylinder and calibrated, but the result not

being considered quite satisfactory, the wire was removed, carefully

annealed, drawn through one hole in a draw plate and remounted, but

with very little better results. This operation was repeated without

advantage, and it became evident that the want of uniformity in the

conducting power was not due to irregularities in the section of the wire,

but was to be attribvited, in all probability, to want of uniformity in the

composition of the alloy.

To avoid further loss of time it was therefore decided to make use of

the wire as it then was, and to correct all readings by the result of an

accurate and close calibration.

The wire was therefore calibrated in 100 equal parts by a method

devised after trying one or two others, and found to be very accurate

and convenient.

It is fully described at the end of this paper.

The wire is wound in twenty convolutions in a spiral groove,

accurately formed in the cylindrical surface of an insulating drum. The

ends of the wire ai"e soldered to massive bars, each brazed to one axle

of the drum, which terminates in an amalgamated copper disc, half

immersed in a cup of mercury.

The mercury cups are themselves connected with the rest of the

apparatus by means of very stout copper rods.

The contact-piece, by means of which the galvanometer is put in circuit,

is mounted on a brass block, moving between two brass rods, and

traversed by a screw after the fashion of the slide rest of a lathe. One

end of the screw carries a toothed wheel, gearing with another wheel

attached to the drum and concentric with it. The pitch of the screw

and the gearing are so calculated that, when the drum is made to

revolve, the contact-piece, whilst moving in a horizontal line parallel

with the axis of the drum, is always in contact with some point of the
wire, upon which it presses lightly by means of a spring.

     The brass toothed wheel has a slightly greater diameter than the

drum to which it is attached. On the flat exterior side near its circum-

ference, it is divided into 1,000 equal parts, and by means of a microscope

with cross-wire eyepiece, the divisions can be read by estimation to
tenths and easily to fifths.

As there are twenty turns, the whole wire can therefore be accurately

divided into 100,000 parts.

Whole turns of the wire are shown by the divisions of a horizontal

scale close to the contact-piece.

To maintain the wire throughout its length at a uniform temperature,

the drum is enclosed in a wooden case in which openings are left for the

Acontact-piece and microscope.     sketch of the apparatus is given in

Plate VI.

To determine the temperature-coefficients of the various bars and

wires, their resistances at two diff'erent temperatures were compared with

that of a standard, maintained as nearly as possible at a constant

temperature.

The higher temperature of comparison was generally nearly that of

boiling water, and was maintained by means of steam. The bars were

immersed in a bath of melted paraffin wax, the interior surface of the

bath being lined throcighout with convolutions of ^ inch ' compo ' gas-
tubincr through which steam was caused to flow.

The lower temperature was about that of the air, the bath just

described was again used ; but paraffin oil was substituted for the wax,
and cold water fi'om the main was made to circulate in the pipe instead
of steam. In both cases the paraffin oil or wax was kept continually
stirred. The standard was also immersed in paraffin oil, kept at a
uniform temperature by the circulation of water from the main, thi'ough

tubing in the containing vessel.

     The paraffin oil used possesses remarkably high insulating qualities,

bobbins of silk-covered wire, even of many thousand ohms resistance,

could be immersed in it, without the least sensible leakage, from spire to

spire. It is sold under the name of ' Strange's Crystal Oil.'

The apparatus for maintaining the desired temperature when the

alloy is in the form of wire is far more convenient than that described

above for the bars. It resembles the instrument used for testing the

boiling point of thermometers.

It is shown in section in the accompanying sketch, fig. 2.

                                  the difference of pressure between the

to have the greatest available cross section ; each is held rigidly in
position by a screw passing radially through the ebonite stopper, and
they ai'e insulated one from the other by an air space, through which pass
the wires for the galvanometer connections, the interstices being after-
wards filled with shellac.

     The ends of the wire to be tested are soldered to the upper extremities

of the copper i-ods. When the wire is short and thick, it is covered with

silk, bent double, and passed into the tube ; when thin, it is wound on a
glass rod, and the whole coated with silk ribbon. The space between
the wire and tube is filled with lead shot of the smallest size, and a ther-
mometer is inserted in the top of the tube, which is then filled quite up

with shot.
     It was found that the shot had an exellent effect in preventing minute

oscillations of temperature, due to draughts or similar causes.
     The battery used was one large Grove cell ; the galvanometer, a

' dead beat ' by White, having a resistance of 1'4 ohms.
     In most cases the absolute resistance of the specimens of alloy was

determined as well as the temperature-coefficient.
     For the bars this was done by comparison with a rod of pure lead of

known dimensions.
    The wires were compared directly with bobbins of known resistance.
     The sectional area of the bars and wires was always calculated from

their weight, specific gravity, and length.
     All bars and wires were annealed before making the electrical

observations.

      The following table shows the resistance and temperature-coefficient
of the first sample of the alloy when in the original bar shape, and when
drawn down to wire of various gauges.

     The platinum and silver are thus very nearly in the prescribed pro-

portion, and the amount of impurity is inconsidei'able. An assay of a

piece cut from one end of the wire 1'578 m.m. in diameter, gave the pro-

portion of platinum as 31"34 %.

    A calibration made from inch to inch in its length showed the

conducting power to be sensibly uniform.

     The temperature-coefficient of this bar was 0'0308%. The specific
gravity and absolute resistance were abnormal, aiid a calibration showed
it was quite irregular in conducting power, the casting being porous and

full of holes.

     Messrs. Johnson and Matthey failed in their attempt to roll or draw
it down into wire, but a small portion was remelted and drawn into wire
0'67 m.m. in diameter, of which the specific gravity was 13-354, the
temperature-coefficient "0282%, and the calculated resistance of 1 metre
of the wire, 1 millimetre in diameter, 0"238 ohms. It was obvious,
therefore, that even if the alloy was of the desired composition, on the
average, it had such a want of uniformity that an analysis was not worth
making.

with tlae two ends of the wire to be calibrated, properly mounted on its
drum. To these copper bars the poles of the battery could be connected

by means of a contact-key.

The series of coils was arranged, in the order above enumerated, in a

trough of water, to maintain uniform temperature. One galvanometer

wire was permanently attached to the sliding contact of the drum, whilst

the loose end of the other galvanometer wire could be dipped in either

of the mercury cups joining the coils, the arrangement thus forming a

Wheatstone's bridge.

The loose galvanometer wire, being first inserted in the mercury cup

joining the outer or left-hand terminal of the coil la with the connecting

bar, a balance was obtained, the reading j-q on the drum being of course

quite close to the end of the wire.

The galvanometer wire was then shifted to the cup between la and

lb, and a balance and reading r, obtained by moving the druai-contact.

The coils la and lb were then transposed in position, and a new

balance and reading r,, very near to rj, were obtained. The loose wire

was then moved to the cup between la and 2, and the balance and read-
ing rg were observed.

This process of transposition and reading was repeated until the coil

la had been moved unit by unit from the left-hand to the right-hand

extremity of the series.

As it is evident that the resistance of the length of wire between pairs

of readings such as r,,, r,, and r^, r^, &c., bears the same ratio to that of

the whole wire to be calibrated as the resistance of the coil la does to

that of the series of which it forms part, and that the latter ratio is a

constant one, being independent of the position in the series which the

coil occupies, it follows that every such length has the same resistance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and the lengths being expressed in terras of divisions of the drum circle,

it is easy to make a table showing the proper corrections.

In practice, the coil la was further subdivided. Four intermediate

points having been determined on the wire of which it was composed,

dividing its resistance into fi.ve equal parts, wires were soldered to these

points and were connected with small mercury cups sunk in the ebonite

bridge-piece of the coil. The case was then filled in with paraffin wax as

usual. In calibrating the drum-wire, therefore, besides the 20 pairs of

readings corresponding with the 20 transpositions of the coil, there were

interpolated between each such pair four additional readings, thus cali-

brating the wire into 100 parts.

The following table gives the I'eadings corresponding to the twenty

transpositions of the coil, their diSerences, which are proportional to the

conducting power of the wire between the points at whicli the readings

are taken, and the percentage- variation from mean conducting power.

In Col. IV. are given the total percentage-corrections for the readings

in Col. V. They are obtained by taking from Col. III. the algebraic
sum of the percentage- variations for all observations included in the

reading, and dividmg by the number of terms summed ; thus the correc-

+tion for drum-reading 3,000, and thereabouts is l'Ql''> Q-835+ 0-513

= 0'788% of the readings.                                                                            o'

                                  All these corrections happen to be

subtractive.

0)1 some New Theorems on Curves of double Curvature.
                       By Professor Sturm.

[A communication ordered by tlie General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                       among the Reports.]

The following theorems on curves of double curvature are the result of

my sti^dy of the very interesting pajDers on twisted curves of the fifth

order, which Professor Cayley has published in the ' Comptes Rendus,'

vol. liv. and Iviii. (1862, 1864). Cayley there considers monoids of

the order vi with a given vertex or summit, and passing through a

given curve of double carvatui'e ; that is to say, surfaces of the order

m, passing through the curve, and having, at a given point O, a multiple
m -- m --point of the degree
                 1 of multiplicity. The cone of the order                    1,

generated by the right lines which have, in common with the surface at

mthis point,  coincident points, contains all lines passing through 0,

and meeting the curve twice. With reference to these lines or chords,

and to their mutual dependence, the consideration of the above-men-

tioned cone has led me to some new results.

1. Consider a curve of the 7ith order, without singular points, to which

7t chords proceed from a given point : let us term it a curve [_n, K\. The

-- --maximum value of li is known to be \{ii 1) (« 2). Halphen has given,*

without proof, the minimum value of A. Kohn, however, has published,

in the ' Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie,' - a demonstration of the

same result, and last winter I also found this minimum value, before

seeing the papers of Halphen and Kohn. This minimum value is

-- --the greatest integer contamed in ( --- therefore t(t 1), or f^,
                                                                                                                                                             J

according as n is equal to 2^ or to 2i -f 1. Curves with this minimum

always exist ; they are each situated on a surface of the second degree, and

form, in the former case, its complete intersection with a surface of the

order t, and, in the latter, when completed by a right line, its complete

+intersection with a surface of the order t \.

     2. Cayley has found that through every curve of the %th order a

--monoid of the {n l)th order, with a given vertex, can be passed. Hence

we infer that through the // chords which proceed from the given point,

--a cone of the order n 2 always passes. And if h has its maximum

value, no cone of an inferior order can possibly contain all the chords
but if h diminishes, such cones become possible. There are certain
values of h to be distinguished. I shall denote them by and7;.^, define

this symbol by the equation

-- --orders-- y, passing through any Ti \(J-- 2)(y 3) of them, contains

also the remaining ones. I was surprised when I first detected this

relation in a special case, viz. the known intersection of a surface of the

third with one of the second ordei-, to which curve six chords proceed

from an arbitrary point, all being situated on a cone of the second degree.*

    <Hence it follows, that, if li h^, a plane curve of the ni\\ order with

h double points is not necessarily the perspective of a twisted curve of

--this order with /; apparent doable points a result with which M.

Halphen also appears to be acquainted.

3. If, farther, two cones of the orders m, in' be drawn through the
--Ji chords their mvi' h remaining edges of intersection will be always
= m + -- --situated on at least one cone of the order v
                                                           in' (n 1). If

>7i /i4, this is self-evident and without interest ; it is not so in other

cases, however, and I have found interesting theorems relating to the

mutual dependence of these remaining edges of intersection and to the

manifoldness of the cones of the order v which pass through them. I

must not, however, attempt to communicate these theorems on this

occasion.

    4. "We have seen that, if h > Jt^, the Ji chords are independent of one

another, so far as the conducting of cones through them is concerned.
They cannot all be given arbitrarily, however ; no more than can, in
general, the double points of a plane curve when their number surpasses

a certain limit. But I must not enter into this matter.
     I will give a construction when h ^lij^, of such a system of /trays issu-

ing from a given point, as are formed by the li chords of a curve [«, /i].
n and h being given, seek, first, that value of j which satisfies the condition

                                  > >hj h hj + 1
-- +then construct an arbitrary cone of the order n 2j 1, with its vertex
--at the given point; take, next, any (n--jy h edges of this cone, and

pass through them two cones of the order n --j ; their remaining h edges

of intersection will be rays of the required kind. The orders

n~-2j + 1 and n --j and --the number (n --j)'^ A are so chosen, that, in

general, neither of the last two cones breaks up, and that these cones have

no farther intersections on the first. I do not say that there always

exists a curve, for which the /; rays thus constructed are chords, or a

cone, for which they are double edges ; I say merely that the h rays
in question have the same properties, with respect to cones passing

through them, as have the h chords of a curve \_n, A]. The degree of

manifoldness of such a system of h rays issuing from a given point is

                         _ + ^3/i, (Ji^ 1) ; h being  h^.

     5. But I was more interested in the degree of manifoldness of the

-- --curve [n, 7i] itself in space, or to use a phrase of Schubert's- the

number of its constants, or, in other words, the number of simple con-

ditions to which it can be submitted. I have, however, not yet suc-

ceeded with the general problem. I have once more found the result,

for h > 7^4, which Halphen has communicated, without demonstration, in
>the above-quoted paper in the ' Comptes Rendus ' ; viz., that if 7; 7t4,

the number of conditions to which a curve [_n, 7i] can be subjected is

always 4?i.2 Bi-ill and Noether have given ^ a lower limit for 7;-. I have

not yet found a connection between their reasoning and mine.

' Kohn seems to have given similar theorems ; but an accurate comparison

will soon show that his theorems are not only different from those above com-

municated, but for the most part selP-evident and therefore without interest.

my- Cf. also  remark in a paper published in Crelle's JoHrnal, vol. lxxx-\-iii.

' Math. Ann., vol. vii.
442 EEPORT-- 1881.

The other case (h < h^) is much more difficult. It is only wheu h haa

its minimum value that tlie problem can be easily solved, because the

curve lies then on a surface of the second degree, and the h chords form

the complete intersection of two cones. The number of conditions is,

= + + + > =if n 2t, i^+ 2t 9, or f^ 2.' 8, according as < is or 2 ; and if
+ + + + + > =n :^ 2t 1, it is t- 3t 10, or t^ 3t 8, according as ^ is or 1.'

I repeat that I have not yet been able to find, for every such system,

of /* rays as that constructed in Ai^t. 4, a cone which has them for double

edges.

6. By considering the monoids passing through a curve [«, /(], I

have arrived at the following theorem :

The cone of lowest order passing through the h chords is of the

>degree n--j, j being defined by : Ji/ I> A +^', i. Hence it follows that
m ~j>for a surface of the order
        n                        to contain the entire curve will be

a condition of the following degree of multiplicity : -

        mn + 1 -- --{\{n --l)(ii 2) -- h] = mn + 1 -- ^.

   mPerhaps the inferior limit of may be smaller, but certainly the

theorem does not subsist in all cases.

      7. I have approached the theory of twisted curves in another manner,

--myby inquiring into the curves situated on a surface of the third order,

old field of research. Following the example of Pliicker, Cayley, and
Chasles, who have considered the curves on a surface of the second
degree,^ I construct all curves on a given cubic surface by means of re-
lations between the pencils of planes Avhose axes are two right lines of the
surface, not situated in the same plane ; in this manner I find 3, 6, 7,
11, 14 species of curves of the orders 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 respectively; on

these I will make but two obser?ations.
     First, it often happens that two species agree in their order n as well

as in the number h of their apparent double points, and hence also in
their rank r, and in the degree of their manifolduess on the surface (which
always is ^r), but differ in the number of their intersections with the
right lines of the surface. For instance, there are two curves of the
sixth order with 10 apparent double points, and with the degree 5 of
manifoldness on the surface : one of them meets 6 right lines 4 times, 15

twice, 6 not at all ; the other meets 1, 1, 10, 5, 5, 5 lines, respectively, in

5, 4, 3, 2, 1, points.

    The second, and, in my estimation, the more important observation is,

that most of these curves on a cubic sui'face are not general ones of
their kind, that is to say, if we construct, on a cubic surface, all possible

curves \_n, K\, and then construct all possible cubic surfaces, we shall

not reach the degree of manifoldness which is proper to a curve [«, li\.
For instance, the cnrves [9, 28] must have the degree 36 of manifoldness ;
but those situated on cubic surfaces have only the degree 27.

    ' Kohn also seeks these numbers, but makes an error in the first case.

     - Ed. Weyr, in his pajDers on twisted curves of the .sixth order (Comjftes
Bendus, vol. Ixxvi.), appears to have overlooked the circumstance, that this con-

dition is not necessarily of the degree mn + 1, and hence to have arrived at

conclusions which are not all valid. So far as these curves are concerned, I might

refer him to my book on Surfaces of ilie Third Order, Art. 73.

Observations of Atmospheric Electricity at the Kew Observatory
   during 1880. By (x. M. Whipple, B.Sc, F.R.A.S., F.M.S.^

   Superintendent.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxtensa
                                            among tlie Ecports.]

                            [Plate VII.]

The results of the observations of Atmospheric Electricity made at the

Kew Observatory have been published at various times, but principally

in a long paper of eiglity-seven pages in the Report of the British

Association for the year 1849, by Mr. W. R. Birt, F.R.A.S., and in a paper

by Professor Everett, F.R.S., in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for

1868.

     The first paper treated of the eye-observations made by the aid of the

beautiful apparatus designed by the late Sir Francis Ronalds, whilst the

latter was based on the reduction of the photographic continuous records

derived from Sir William Thomson's well-known divided ring Electro-

meter, in connection with a water-dropping collector.

     Since the beginning of 1873 a quadrant Electrometer has been in

almost constant work. By the kindness of Mr. De La Rue, who allowed

the use of his large chloride of silver battery for the purpose, the value

in absolute measure of the deflections of this instrument has been deter-

mined, and therefore we are now able to give the potential of the Atmo-

Kewsjjheric Electricity at  from time to time in volts instead of in arbitrary

values, as has been done in preceding discussions.

Owing to the incessant and frequent changes in the atmospheric

tension, the tabulation of the photographic traces with any degree of

certainty entails a considerable amount of labour, and although Professor

Everett devised a most ingenious method of obtaining the hourly mean
values from the curves, yet we found it impossible in the ordinary

work of the Observatory to devote the time to the instrument that it

necessitated, and hence our seven years' indications have up till recently

remained unavailable for discussion.

Lately I succeeded in devising a modification of Professor Everett's

method, and constructed a glass scale, by means of which the tabulation

of the curves can be efiected with the greatest facility and expedition.

Accordingly we have now commenced the tabulation and discussion of

the accumulated records, and, by the kind permission of the Meteorogical

Council, I am able to lay a few of the facts derived from the curves for

1880 before the members of the British Association.

     Having determined the values of the atmospheric tension for every
hour during the year, when measurement of the trace was possible, the

diurnal, monthly, and annual variations were computed.
     For brevity I only give here the values of the mean monthly, diurnal,

and annual ranges, which are as follows. See Tables I. and II.
     Having plotted these, the curves wei'e contrasted with those given by

Mr. Birt and by Professor Everett, with the view of finding Avhat, if any

difference, in the phenomena observed may be attributed to instrumental

causes.

    As Mr. Birt in his discussion treats separately the positive and nega-
tive tensions, we have also omitted the negative readings, which are com-

paratively few in number, and compared the results with the similar values

he obtained. The separation in our case does not produce any marked
influence on the final curves, the general featui'es of diurnal and annual

changes being virtually identical in both.

     The mean diurnal curve for 18S0 closely follows Professor Everett's,
indicating a minimum tension of about 74 volts at 3 p.m., and rising to a
maximum of 113 volts at 9 and 10 p.m., from which there is a steady fall
to a second minimum of 74 volts at 4 A.M., afterwards rising to the other
maximum of 88 volts at 9 a.m.

     In both cases the very rapid fall of tension observed by Birt to take
place between 10 p.m. and midnight disappears in favour of a more gentle
descent. The difference between the diurnal and nocturnal minimum

tensions so conspicuous in the periodical eye-observations also disappears
in the continuous records.

and it is found that, as a rule, the curves of the three series closely resemble

one another, indicating in all cases a much greater variation in tension
during the twenty-four hours in the winter months than in the summer,

     The fact of frequency of negative tension with rain has long been
observed ; bnt it is found that it is almost always accompanied with large
and rapid excursions on the side of positive tension, and therefore the
averao"e hourly value of the tension during such periods is seldom low.

     One year's data can scarcely be considered to give perfectly decisive
results ; but it is believed that the following conclusions may be drawn
from the observations now under discussion.

    In the first case, it is found that genei-ally the relations differ in summer

and in winter ; their variations are therefore given as well as their means.

     This, however, is not very well-marked in summer, when there does
not seem to be a very defined relation between the two phenomena ; it is

almost entirely due to the winter observations. See Table IV.

     2ud. Cloud. Both summer and winter results agree in giving a direct

ratio between the electrical tension of the air and the cloudiness of the
sky ; the average tension under an almost cloudless sky being more than
double what it is under a completely overcast one, the observed values
being for the former 142 volts, and for the latter 66. See Table V.

given above may possibly need correction at some future date, but as no

radical change affecting the accuracy of the instrument has been made, it

is assumed the values here given are not far from the truth.

Owing to the unsuitabiJity of the instrument for the registration of

phenomena of very brief duration it is not jiossible to give any values

for the tensions observed during periods, of great electrical disturbance,

such  as  thunder  or hail storms                                                                              it  may, however, be  remarked that  on

such occasions the deflections of the needle far exceed the limits of regis-

-- +tration of the electrograph, which are from about 150 to (JOO volts.

Excursions of the dot of light through a considerably larger range

than the above may be watched taking place with every flash of lightning

during a storm, but the rate of movement across the paper is far too

rapid to permit of photographic registry.

Magnetic disturbances and aurorte are not found to produce any-

marked changes in the indications of the instrument.

         On the Arrestathon of Infusorial Life by Solar Light.
                     By Professor John Tyndall, F.R.S.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxienso
                                             among the Reports.]

Three years ago I bi'ought with me to the Alps a number of flasks

charged with animal and vegetable infusions. The flasks had been boiled
from three to five minutes in London, and hermetically sealed durmg

ebullition.

    Two years ago I had sent to me to Switzerland a batch of similar
flasks containing other infusions. On my arrival here this year, one
hundred and twenty of these flasks lay upon shelves in my little library.
Though eminently putrescible, the animal and vegetable juices had re-
mained as sweet and clear as when they were prepared in London.

     Still an expert, taking up one of the flasks containing an infusion of
beef or mutton, would infallibly pronounce it to be charged with organisms.

He would find it more or less turbid throughout, with massive flocculi

moving heavily in the liquid. Exposure of the flask for a minute or two
to lukewarm water would cause both turbidity and flocculi to disappear,
and render the infasion as clear as the purest distilled water. The
turbidity and flocculi are simply due to the coagulation of the liquid to a
jelly. This fact is some guarantee for the strength of the infusions.

      I took advantage of the clear weather this year to investigate the
action of solar light on the development of life in these infusions, being
prompted thereto by the interesting observations brought before the

Eoyal Society by Dr. Dowues and Mr. Blunt in 1877.' The sealed ends
of the flasks being broken off, they were infected, in part by the water of
an adjacent brook and in part by an infusion well charged with organisms.

Hung up in rows upon a board, half the flasks of each row were securely

shaded from the sun, the other half being exposed to the light. In some
cases, moreover, flasks were placed in a darkened room, within the house,
while their companions were exposed in the sunshine ontside.

     The clear result of these experiments, of which a considerable number
were made, is that by some constituent or constituents of the solar radia-

                                         ' Proc. Itoy. Soc, December 6.
ON THE EFFECTS OF OCEANIC CUKRENTS UPON CLIMATES.  451

 tion, an influence is exercised inimical to the development of the lowest
 infusoria. Twenty-four hours usually sufliced to cause the shaded flasks
 to pass from clearness to turbidity, while thrice this time left the exposed
 ones without sensible damage to their transparency.

      This result is not due to mere differences of temperature between the

 infusions. On many occasions the temperature of the exposed flasks was

 far more favourable to the development of life than that of the shaded
 ones. The energy which, in the cases here referred to, prevented putre-
 faction was energy in the radiant form.

      In no case have I found the flasks sterilized by insolation ; for on

removing the exposed ones from the open air to a warm kitchen they

infalliby changed from clearness to turbidity. Four and twenty hours
were in most cases suSicient to produce this change.

      Life is therefore prevented from developing itself in the infusions, as
long as they are exposed to the solar light ; and the paralysis, tlaus
produced, enables them to pass through the night-time without alteration.

It is, however, a suspension, not a destruction of the germinal power,

for, as before stated, when placed in a warm room life was invariably

developed.

     Had I had the requisite materials I should have determined, by means

of coloured media, or otherwise, the particular constituents of the solar

radiation which are concerned in this result. The rays, moreover, which
thus interfere with life, must be absorbed by the liquid, or by its germinal

matter. It would, therefore, be interesting to ascertain whether, after
transmission through a layer of any infusion, the radiation still possessed

the power of arresting the development of life in the same infusion. It

would also be interesting to examine how far insolation may be employed

in the preservation of meat from putrefaction.

  --Note. I would not be understood to say that it is impossible to

sterilize an infusion by insolation, but merely to indicate that I have thus
far noticed no case of the kind.

          On the Effects of Oceanic Currents upon Climates.
              By the Kev. Samuel Haughton, 31.D., F.R.S.

       [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxtenso
                                             among the Reports.]

The Gulf Stream and its counter-current, the Labrador current, produce

important effects upon climate, which I propose to investigate in some
detail, as much misappi'ehension exists as to what they do and do not do

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and I propose further to consider what the effect of similar currents and
counter-cnrrents would be, if admitted to the Arctic Ocean from the
Pacific through a widened and deepened Behring Sti'ait, and if admitted
to the Arctic Ocean, from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea (by lower-
ing Mesopotamia), through the Great Caspian depression in the west of

Asia.'

     ' Mr. Alfred Eussel Wallace has ingeniously proposed these two additional Gulf
Streams as causes of climatal changes in recent Geological times in the Arctic Zone,
but he does not seem to be aware of the effects of the counter-currents they would

necessarily produce.

Oi", in otlicr words, the forces prodncing tlie Kuro-Siwo are ncai'ly two

and a half times greater than the forces producing the Gulf Stream.

To find, from the foregoing ratio of the volumes of the two ocean-

In oi'der to find the actual relative cSect of the Pacific and Atlantic

ocean-currents in affecting climate at any locality we must further take

account of the relative areas over which these effects are spread. In the

North Pacific, the Ja,nuary temperatures are raised from the 30th parallel

of latitude to the G5th parallel ; and in the North Atlantic, from the

40th parallel to the 80th parallel. I have calculated the I'elative areas of

these surfaces, and find it to be as 44,014 to 24,511.

Hence the absolute heating effect of the Kuro-Siwo, as compared with

the Gulf Stream, will be

Atlantic                             44014

    From these calculations it follows that although the volume of the

Kuro-Siwo is 2-42 times greater than that of the Gulf Stream, its heating

effect is only l-2t) times greater.

    "We are now in a position to calculate numerically the effect upon

climate that would be produced by widening and deepening BehrinDg
Strait. I shall suppose it widened and deepened from the Kamtschatka
mountain range on the west to the mouth of the Mackenzie river on the
east, by the submersion of the Tchukchi land, and of Aliaska and

Alaska.

Parallel of 60° N. January Temperature.

     In the North Atlantic, the effect of the Gulf Stream is shown by its

raising the temperature of January, from long. 30° W. to long. 10° E., to
a mean of -f 32°-8 F., whereas the mean temperature of this parallel at

    If we now suppose the Kuro-Siwo admitted through the widened

Behring Strait to produce a similar effect in the proportion of 129 to

100, we obtain the following results :
     The present mean January temperatures at Behring Strait are as

     As stated above, the eS'ect of the Gulf Stream, in the Xovth Atlantic,

+is to raise the temperature of January from l°-7 F. to 32°'S F. through

40° of longitude atTectcd bj it. The effect of the Knro-siwo admitted
through Behring Strait, may therefore be measured by a corresponding

rise of temperature, through

                   =40 X 1-29 51°-6 of longitude.

This would  produce a mean January temperature, at all            longitudes,

equal to

                               360

     This raising of the January temperature, at Behring Sti-ait, from

-- 19°*0 F. to 32°*8 F. ^-ould, of course, produce in the longitudes affected

by it an important effect in saving from destruction plants and trees

--which would perish at 19°'0 F. in winter, but would give no benefit

whatever to plants requiring a given July temperatui'O to ripen their

seeds.

     Its effect, at all longitudes, is to raise the January temperature through

4°-46 F. and the mean annual temperature through 2°-23 F.

            Parallel of 70° N. January Temperature.

     The January temperatures, in the N. Atlantic at 70° lat., are raised

by the Gulf Stream, from long. 10^ W. to long. 20° E., to a mean of

+ -20°-75 F.,_ instead of 15°-5 F. at all longitudes, the July tempera-

tures remaining unaffected.

     The corresponding eifects at Behring Strait (widened and deepened)
would be thus found, assuming as before the proportion of 5 to 4 for
the relative thermal effects of the Kuro-Siwo and Gulf Stream :

     Calculating, as before, the effect of the Kuro-Siwo (admitted through
Behring Strait) upon all longitudes, I find that it would raise the Januarv
temperature through

            =30 X 1-29 38°-7 of longitude,

--from  24°-6 F., which is the present temperature of the longitudes

+affected, to the temperature of 20°-75 F., and that the consequent

January temperature at all longitudes would be :

            ^^ =-20-75 X 38-7 15-5 x 321-3  - no11 -.5o3 tFp.

     The January rise of temperature at all longitudes is therefore 3°-97 F.,
and the rise of mean annual temperature is l°-99 F.

     This alteration would confer little benefit upon plant-life at that high

latitude.

ON THE EFFECTS OF OCEANIC CURRENTS UPON CLIMATES.  459

    When an ocean-current moving from sontb to north ohtains admis-

sion to the Arctic Ocean, it produces necessarily, on hydrodynamical
principles, an equal and opposite counter-current moving from north to
south. The tepid water-current is forced by the rotation of the earth to
shift its direction continually to the right, and thus it happens that the
Galf Stream is pressed upon the western shores of Europe and Spitz-

bergen, and benefits those localities in winter. On the other hand the

cold counter- current returning through Baffin's Bay and along the east
coast of Greenland, is also forced by the earth's i-otation to keep to its
right, and so is pi'essed upon the coast of Labrador and the east coast of

North America as far south as Cape Cod. This return or counter current,

known as the Labrador Current, and others, exercises an influence upon

climate the opposite of that of the Gulf Stream, and of such a kind as to
render it very doubtful whether the Gulf Stream is a I'eal benefit to the

climate of the whole globe or not.

     "While the Gulf Stream raises the January temperature of all places
visited by it, the Labrador or counter-current loxvers the July tempera-
ture of all places affected by it. This is readily shown by the following

figures :

Belirmg Strait, having at least double the volume of the Atlantic
counter-currents, would bring the iceberg-limit in eastern Asia as far

south as Pekin ^ (40° lat.), and cover the valley of the Amoor and the

northern Japanese islands with a coating of glacial ice.^

     The destruction of vegetation caused by the Kuro-Siwo counter-
currents would be far more than equivalent to the small benefits obtained
in January temperatures from its admission to the Arctic regions.

     Prop. III. It is required to calculate the effects upon climate of an
ocean-current admitted to the Arctic Ocean from tlie Indian Ocean, across
the Casjjian and Aral Sea depression, to the east of the Ural Mountain-chain
and Nova Zemhla.

     This ocean-current has been suggested by Mr. Alfred R. "Wallace as a
probable cause of recent changes in climate, and is highly probable on

geological grounds.

     The mean width of the Indian Ocean, in tropical latitudes, as com-
pared with that of the Atlantic Ocean, is as 520 to 625. The mean
annual temperatures of the air in the Indian Ocean are

the counter- cui'rent of cold water.

     If we calculate from Ferrel's Tables, as before the effect of the new

--North Indian Ocean current, reckoned as four-fifths of the Gulf Stream,

wo find as follows :

  --Latitude 60°. It will raise the January temperature, from 70° E. long,

- +to 102° E. long., from 10°-0 F. to 32°-8 P. ; which is equivalent to a
+ +rise at all longitudes from 6°-16 F. to 8°-53 F.

  --Latitude 70°. It will raise the January temperature, from 80° B. long,

- +to 104° B. long., from 18°-33 F. to 20°-75 F. ; which is equivalent to
- -a rise at all longitudes from ll°-53 F. to 9°-36 F.

  --Latitude 80°. It will raise the January temperature, from 90° E. long,

- -to 130° B. long., from 27°-4 F. to 10°-44 F., which is equivalent to a

-- -rise at all longitudes from 21°-87 F. to 20°-3 F.

     If we bring together, into one point of view, all the preceding results,
we find the following changes of winter climate produced in the Arctic
regions by the successive introduction of the Gulf Stream, the Knro-Siwo
(North Pacific Stream), and the North Indian Ocean Stream.

     The height of the line of perpetnal snow depends upon two factors
only : (1) the temperati^re of the summer months (July) ; (2) the supply
of aqueous vapour to form the snow.

                                                  By Professor William Grylls Adams, F.R.S.

                                                                                         [Plates YIIL-XIII.]

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extcnso
                                        among the Reports.]

In considering the changes or disturbances produced in the three magnetic

elements, viz., the declination, the horizontal force, and the vertical force,
Ave must distinguish between the regular changes, which depend on the

apparent motions of the sun or the moon, and those more sudden and some-

times violent changes which are especially termed magnetic disturbances.

    Among the regular changes are daily and yearly changes, which de-

pend on the time of the day and the season of the year, showing that

the change of position and the apparent motion of the sun with respect

to the place of observation produce res:ular magnetic changes. These

regular daily changes are accompanied by and have very generally been

supposed to be due to electric currents or electric waves traversing the

earth's crust                                                                     and a  discussion by Dr. Lloyd  of the observations made by
                                                                               ;

Mr. Barlow, in 1847, of currents on telegraph wires, showed a very close

relationship between the two-hourly changes of the declination needle

and the changes of intensity and direction of earth-currents on tele-

graph linos.

    Both Dr. Lamont and Dr. Lloyd conclude, from their comparisons of
earth-currents and magnetic changes, that the changes of the declination

needles cannot be due to the direct action of the electric current travers-

ing the earth's crust, but that these currents or waves, extending to a

considerable depth, alter by induction the magnetism of the earth itself,
and this change of magnetism causes the observed changes iu the decli-

nation needle. Thus th.e magnetic changes are the indirect effects of

----not the earth-current in its immediate neighbourhood but of a change

in the magnetism of the earth itself, which may be due to an electric

wave extending over a considerable area of the earth's surface.
     The point towards which the total earth-current is directed follows

the sun, and seems to lag two or three hours behind, but not the same
distance behind at different places.

     These earth-cnrr^nts have been ascribed to different causes thus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

Dr. Lamont regards them as the results of electric force emanating from

the sun                                         De Saussure regards them as developed by evaporation, the

      Mr. Ellis, of the Greenwich Observatory, has shown the intimate re-
 lation between solar action and the regular diurnal magnetic changes
 of declination and horizontal force at Greenwich Observatory during
 thirty-five years, from 1841 to 1876, by a comparison of the observations
 of those elements. The results of his observations are recorded in a
 valuable paper published in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
 Society' (vol. 171, part ii. 1880), and they show what a close relation-
 ship exists between solar activity and terrestrial magnetic changes.
 There are not only daily and yearly periods of the variations of dif-
 ferent magnetic elements, but there also seems to be in the horizontal
 force a period of 25 or 26 days, which is the time of rotation of the
 sun on his axis. Such a period would be a very strong argument in
 favour of regarding the sun as a magnetic body, in which, as in the
 earth, the axis of rotation does not coincide with the magnetic axis.

      Other recent investigations have shown that these regular magnetic
 changes depend not only on the sun, but that they are also in part due
to the action of the moon ; and these portions depend upon the length of
the lunar day, and on the position of the moon with regard to the earth.
Just as there are regular earth-currents, whose direction depends upon the
sun, which we may call the solar earth-currents, so there are lunar earth-
currents which go through their changes under the action of the moon ; and
it has been shown that the effects are produced, not immediately under

the moon, but that there is a lagging behind in the case of the lunar earth-
currents, just as in the case of the solar earth-curi-ents. In the case of

the lunar earth-currents we cannot attribute the production of the elec-

tricity either to heat or to thermo-electric currents from one part to

another of the earth's crust, and we must therefore look for some other
source. May we not find it in the fact that the moon causes tides in the
solid crust of the earth, just as she causes tides in the oceans ? The earth's
crust is made up of elastic materials and materials capable of yielding and
altering their form to a considei-able amount with the change in the direc-
tion of the pull of the moon upon them.

      This crust also contains magnetic substances in abundance, which alter
their form vender the moon's attraction, and so, from the changes of rela-
tive position of masses of magnetic matter, changes are produced in the
magnetism of the earth, which must give rise to induced currents of
electricity or earth- currents. Let us imagine a conductor of electricity
outside the earth, stretching from the north pole to the equator, and
fixed in space, with the earth, a magnetic body, revolving beneath it from

W. to E., then it follows, from Faraday's laws of induced currents, that

the revolution of the earth on its axis would cause a current in the fixed

conductor in a direction from the pole to the equator.

    If the conductor moved over the surface of the earth from W. to E.,

and the earth did not revolve, or revolved at a slower rate, then the
current in the conductor would be from the equator to the pole. The
current depends upon the relative motion of the earth and the wire. If,

then, we have an insulated wire running north and south, the tides in

the earth's crust, of which I have spoken, will be equivalent to a lagging

behind of magnetic matter, and so we may expect in that wire a current

of electricity whose general direction would be from the equator to the
pole. The position of the wire with reference to the magnetic pole of
the earth would modify the direction of these earth-currents, and it
is quite conceivable that the position of England with regard to the

magnetic pole might cause these regular earth-cni'rents to be greatest in
the S.W. and N.E. direction. The lagging of the lunar eai'th-currents be-

hind the position of the moon would also be accounted for by the lagging

of the tides behind the moon.

     If this is a true cause for some portion at least of the lunar earth-

currents, then the same reasoning, applied to the sun, may in a smaller

degree apply to the case of the regular solar diurnal earth-currents, and

may help to account for the lagging behind of the effects due to the sun,

so that the fact that the greatest solar effect happens about 2.80 p.m.

may not be entirely due to the fact that that is the hottest part of the
day, but may also in part depend upon the tides.

   We have now to consider those more sudden changes of the sus-

pended magnets which are distinguished by the name magnetic dis-

turbances. In 1874, Dr. Lloyd said of them : ' The duration and the

magnitude of these oscillations are as yet outside the domain of law,

and probably depend upon so many operating causes that, like the gusts

and lulls of the wind in an atmospheric storm, they will long bafHe all
attempts to refer them to their actuating forces, or even to reduce them

to order.'

Certain facts relating to these disturbances were made out from the

series of observations started by Gauss in 1834, and made every five

minutes at the same time at a variety of places, at first in Europe, and

afterwards in various parts of the world.

     The disturbing power was found to increase in northern latitudes
also it was made out that the appearance of a disturbance in several

places occurred at the same time, but there were great differences in the

results at different places.

     The force seemed to originate in a certain point in the interior of the

earth, and the direction of the disturbing force seemed to be constant,

yet sometimes there were great differences in the deviations at places

not far apart, and from the result of his observations Weber was led to

believe that there was a centre of disturbances, which was somewhere in

the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg.

    However sudden and unconnected single disturbances may seem to

be, they still follow certain laws in their occui-rence. Sabine found that

they had daily and yearly variations from their mean values, and that

they have an 11-year period, which agrees with the 11-year period

of the appearance of spots upon the sun.

Disturbances are more frequent in summer than in winter, and this

applies to each hemisjjhere, and it has been confirmed by various

observers that they are also subject to the influence of the moon.
     Lamont says of these disturbances, their cause is a force which is

subject to certain laws, but which does not act constantly ; the mean

direction and frequency have yet to be discovered. Observations have
shown that the magnetic disturbances and electric currents on the earth
are so nearly related to one another, that people naturally look upon the
electric currents, either in the crust of the earth or in the atmosphere

outside it, as the cause of the magnetic disturbances. These currents in
the earth have usually been attributed to changes of temperature, because

they also are found to be in some way governed by the sun.
     The improved methods of recording observations by photography

give the opportunity of discovering the laws of the occurrence of
magnetic disturbances, and for some years past photographic records

Lave been taken of the magnetic elements, but the curves have been laid

aside, and very little use has as yet been made of them.
    At the meeting of the British Association last year at Swansea, I laid

before the Mathematical and Physical Section an account' of a com-

parison of the Declination Curves taken by precisely similar instruments

at six European magnetic observatories, viz., Kew, Stonyhurst, Coimbra,

Lisbon, Vienna, and St. Petersburg. Since that time I have had the

opportunity, through the kindness of the Kew Committee, of studying

the horizontal force curves from these stations, the vertical force
curves from some of them as well as the declination and horizontal

force curves from Melbourne, and from Zi-ka-Wei in China, for the same
period (March 1879). I have also compared the curves from these
stations, and from Toronto, for the violent magnetic storm which took

place in August, 1880. I have now to bring before you some further

points which come out of these comparisons.

It must be remembered that at stations near the poles the horizontal

force is smaller in proportion to the total force than it is at stations near

to the equator, so that the same disturbance will produce less effect on

the horizontal force or on the declination needle, in latitudes near the

equator.

Also the needles at different stations are by no means in the same

state of sensibility, and even at the same station they change with time,

so that they are not always equally sensitive, and when they lose their

magnetism they have to be re-magnetised.

Let us take first the disturbances on March 15-16, 1879. (See

WePlate VIII.)  see that soon after 10 a.m. G.M.T., on March 15, 1879,

thei-e is a disturbance wave, showing first a diminution and then an

increase in the horizontal force at St. Petersburg, Vienna, Kew, and
Lisbon. At Melbourne, in Australia, there is a similar disturbance at
the same time, both in the declination and in the horizontal force.

     Again, between 2 and 3 p.m., and between 4 and 5, there are very
small disturbances, showing themselves at the same absolute time in the

horizontal force and declination curves. About 5.20 p.m. there is a well-
marked increase in the horizontal force and eastward deflection of the

declination needles.

About 9.30 p.m. G.M.T., a storm begins, which lasts for about an hour.

It is felt in the northern and in the southern hemispheres, near to and
on both sides of the equator. At all European stations the horizontal

force is increased during the first part of the storm, and then diminished.
    At Lisbon the vertical force is first increased and then diminished,

and at St. Petersburg and Stonyhurst there is a diminution in the ver-

tical force at the same time as at Lisbon. If we regard the declination

needles we find that at St. Petersburg, Zi-ka-Wei and Melbourne, and at
Bombay the declination westward is first increased and then diminished,

whereas at Kew and Lisbon the motions are in the opposite direction.

    The declination at Vienna seems to be intermediate between Kew and

St. Petersburg, but the curve is incomplete. At Bombay and the

Mauritius, near to, but on opposite sides of, the equator, the declination

needles are deflected opposite ways. The deflections are small, because
the needles are not sufficiently sensitive. The local time at these places
was from 1 to 2 o'clock at night.

ON MAGNETIC DISTDEBANCES AND EARTH-CUllRENTS.  467

    Now in what way can we accotmt for siicli magnetic disturbances ?

If we assume that by magnetic induction from some cause or other the
earth's magnetism is altered, then the position of the magnet which
would produce the disturbance must be such that its pole, which
attracts the marked end of our needle, must lie at the beginning of the

disturbance to the E. of Kew and Lisbon, to the N. of Vienna, and to

the N.W. of St. Petersburg ; the Lisbon vertical force curve also shows
it to be below the surface of the earth. Hence an inductive action

equivalent to a change of position of the north magnetic pole, towards
the geog. pole, would account for these changes. The strengthening
and weakening of a magnet, with its N. pole to the N., on the meridian
of Vienna, might possibly account for the magnetic changes observed

between 9.30 and 10.30 at night, Greenwich time, on March 15, 1879.
     If we attempt to explain this disturbance by currents of electricity or

discharges of statical electricity in the air above the needles, then we
must imagine that at first there is a strong current from the S.W., over
St. Petersburg, from the W., over Vienna, and from the N.W., over

Kew and Lisbon ; the vertical force needle at Lisbon showing that the

current from the N.W. lies somewhat to the east of Lisbon. That at
the Mauritius this current is from the north, and at Bombay from the

sou.th.

     Hence we must imagine that a current of electricity passes down
from the N.W. to the S.E., going on towards the E. over Vienna, and
towards the N.E. over St. Petersburg. This must be kept up very much

along the same line throughout the first part of the disturbance, and then
the current or currents must be altered in strength in the same manner

at all stations.

    We will next consider what would hardly be called a magnetic

storm, but a few very small deviations of the magnetic needle lasting from
about 5.30 to 7.30 p.m. on March 26, 1879. (See Plate IX.) Only the

comparison of the originals will give the closeness of the similaiity of

the curves, and the declination curves of Vienna and Kew are absolutely

coincident.

    When the declination needle is deflected to the west, the horizontal

force-needle is deflected with its marked end towards the south, so that

in this disturbance the two needles are drawn towards the S.W. at the

same time with greater or less power, and twelve similar curves are clearly

traced out in the Vienna and Kew curves during the two hours. These

disturbances are all so small that, but for the comparison of photographs,

they would probably be lost sight of, yet we see that the same deflections

occur at the same instant at Kew and at Vienna, at St. Petersburg and
at Melbourne. From the remarkable similarity in these disturbances, and

their occurrence at the same time, we should expect that the cause of dis-

turbance is so far removed from the places of observation, that the difier-
ence of their distances from it need not be considered. This might not

unreasonably be urged as an argument in support of a theory that such
disturbances are due directly to the action of the sun regarded as a mag-
netic body. The numerical comparisons of observations made every five

minutes on certain days previously fixed upon, would probably never have

shown the way in which these minute changes of the magnetic power of

the earth at widely distant places are related to one another.

      In one or two cases Sefior Oapello and Professor Balfour Stewart had

Compared the Lisbon and Kew curves for a particular disturbance, but

                                       hh2
468 REPORT-- 1881.

the photograpliic magnetic records have never before been collected from

other stations, and there has been no opportunity of comparing them.

From the precise similarity of the forms of the curves in many cases, we

may say that the rate of change of magnetic disturbances at widely distant

stations is the same. There is nothing fitful or flashing in such disturb-

Weances as these of March 26.  might imagine a current in the crust of

the earth, or a current or transfer of electricity in the air near to, i.e. within

twenty or thirty miles of, each of these observatories, but to imagine the

same current and the same variations of the current at so many different

stations all changing in the same way at the same instant is difficult,

unless it can be shown in what way all these changes are connected with

the cause of such a regular electric discharge. It seems easier to imagine

that such changes as these are due to a change produced by induction in

the magnetism of the earth itself by some distant body.

Sometimes disturbances occur where at the same instant there are

similar deflections of the declination needles at stations wide apart, and

suddenly at one of the stations the needle no longer continues to move

with the others, but begins to go, and continues for a considerable period

to go, in the opposite direction to the others, turning when they turn, and

tracing out a similar curve, but turned always in the opposite direction.

Such cases occurred frequently during March 1879, and especially on

March 23, about 1.30 and about 7 p.m. Kew time, and on March 29 about

9 p.m.

During the month of August 1880, a very good opportunity occurred

for studying a grand magnetic storm, which was accompanied by brilliant

displays of Aurora and by earth -currents. This storm began on August

11, and lasted until the 14th, and may be divided into three distinct storms

--one lasting from 10.20 a.m. (G.M.T.) on the 11th to 1 a.m. on the 12th
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

a second from 11.30 a.m. on the 12th to 7.20 a.m. on the 13th ; and the
third from 11.50 a.m. on the 13th to 7 a.m. on the 14th. Smaller disturb-

ances fill up the interval between the second and third storms.

Four plates have been prepared from very careful tracings from the

photographic records at the several observatories. In the cases of Toronto

and Zi-ka-Wei the time-scales are not the same as at Kew, and the curves

have been taken from carefully drawn curves which have been plotted on

the Kew scale. The plates show the principal portions of the three

storms. The beginning of the first storm (August 11) is marked at all

stations by a sudden considerable increase in the horizontal force.

(Plate X.) At Kew the beginning of the storm is not actually re-

corded, because a new sheet was being put on the cylinder at 10.20 a.m.,

when the storm was beginning. The Kew deflections are smaller than

the others, because the horizontal force needle at Kew was less sensitive

than the others, the scale-values being -00127 mm. mg. for 1 mm. at Kew,

as compared with -00029 mm. mg. for 1 mm. at St. Petersburg. The

storm begins at the same instant in Europe, Asia, and America, in high

northern and southern latitudes, and also near the equator at Bombay,

and everywhere precisely in the same way. It may also be traced at

the Mauritius, and there are very distinct similarities of form between

the Mauritius and Lisbon curves. The practical value of the curves

at the Mauritius and at some other stations is greatly diminished, because

the needles do not appear to be sufficiently sensitive to show the character

of the magnetic changes.

During the early part of the storm, on August 11, after the first de-

flection, the general direction of the Toronto deflections is opposed to those

at  tbe  other  stations                                            but from 4 p.m.  to  8 p.m. (G.M.T.),  i.e.  from about
                                                                 ;

10.40 a.m. to 2.40 p.m. Toronto time, the deflections are alike, and in the

same direction at Toronto and at European stations. (See Plate XI.)

Again, about 11 p.m., there is a very violent phase of the storm, in which

the deflections are alike and in the same direction at Toronto, Zi-ka-Wei,

and at the European stations.

    There is considerable similarity in the form of the Toronto horizontal

force curve and the Melbourne declination curve for the beginning of the

storm. There is also a remarkably close agreement between the horizontal

force curves at Kew and at Vienna during the storm, the diff"ereuces in

the amount of the deflections being due to the fact that the needles are

not equally sensitive. The horizontal force curves at Kew and Bombay

also agree very closely during the first four hours of the storm, after which

the Bombay needle shows very little action.

    The second storm, beginning about 11.30 a.m. (G.M.T.) on the 12th,

and lasting until the next morning, was the most remarkable of the three.

Plate XII. gives the changes in the magnetic elements from 10 a.m. on the

12th to 1 a.m. on the 13th. At about 11.40 a.m. the disturbances begin to
become violent, and from 12 to 1 they are so great that in some cases the

paper is not wide enough to receive the record, and in others the paper is

either not sensitive enough to record the impressions or is so blackened

that it is impossible to trace the form of the record upon it. The hori-

zontal force trace at Toronto and the declination trace at Kew go ofl"

the paper. At Melbourne and at Vienna the trace fails.

    At the time of greatest disturbance, 12.25 p.m., it is very remarkable

that at Lisbon and at Zi-ka-Wei near Shanghai, in China, two places

nearly in the same latitude but about nine hours apart in time, the

vertical force is increased in precisely the same way and to about the

same amount at the same instant. There is also a striking similarity

between the Melbourne and the Zi-ka-Wei horizontal force curves and

between the Zi-ka-Wei and Kew declination curves.

     At Zi-ka-Wei the sudden change in the horizontal force amounted to

about -033 m.m.-m.g. units, or t-jVo*^ P^i"*- of ^^^ ^'Ot^l horizontal force. At
St. Petersburg the change in the horizontal force amounted to '04 m.m.

m.g. units, or ^^^th part of the whole horizontal force, and the total force
was changed by about ^^tb part of its full value. This second storm is

remarkable for the very great diminution in the vertical force at St.

Petersburg. Prom ,5.30 p.m. to 12.30 (local time), the vertical force

diminishes by -06 (m.m. m.g.), the horizontal force in the same interval

diminishing by "04 (m.m. m.g.)

     There are also remarkable points of agreement during the storm, as

may be seen by a careful comparison of the curves, but the agreement

between St. Petersburg horizontal and vertical force curves compared

with Kew and Lisbon declination curves is remarkable about 4.30 p.m.

and between 7 and 8 p.m., when the change in the horizontal force in

about ten minutes at St. Petersburg amounted to -027 m.m. m.g. units

or o\yth of the horizontal force.

    With the Lisbon declination curves there is some uncertainty, as the

times of the beginning and end are not marked upon the tracing, and the

time-scale does not appear to be quite the same as for the horizontal or

vertical force curves.

    Thus we see that the magnetic changes which take place at various
--470

points of the earth's surface at the same instant are so large as to be quite
comparable with the earth's total magnetic force ; and in order that any

cause may be a true and sufficient one, it must be capable of producing
these changes rapidly. They are so large that any cause which is shown

to be incompetent to produce the earth's magnetism can hardly be held to
account for such terrestrial magnetic changes. Since the large distur-
bances and the small disturbances do not follow totally different laws, but

agree equally well all over the earth, in so far as they agree we must
attribute them to the same cause.

     In the third storm, on August 13th (see Plate XIII.), the general
character of the disturbances is the same at St. Petersburg, at Kew, at
Lisbon, and at Vienna, as shown by a comparison of the horizontal force
as well as of the declination curves, and the vertical force needles are
similarly affected at St. Petersburg and at Stonyhurst ; but about 11.30
p.m., when the horizontal force at other European stations is considerably

increased, the horizontal force at St. Petersburg is very greatly diminished,

so that the record passes off the edge of the paper. The horizontal force
at Zi-ka-Wei is greatly diminished, and at Melbourne is also diminished
at the same time, the vertical force at St. Petersburg and at Stonyhurst
being at the same time diminished to its lowest value during the storm.
There are some very remarkable points of agreement between the St.
Petersburg horizontal force and the Zi-ka-Wei declination and horizontal
force curves, considering that the two places of observation differ nearly
30° in latitude, and are 6 hours apart in time. The Melbourne horizontal
force curve also bears a very striking resemblance to the Zi-ka-Wei hori-
zontal force curve, more especially from 11 p.m. until the end of the
storm. The Melbourne declination curve inverted and the Zi-ka-Wei
declination curve also have many characteristics in common. Taking the
Mauritius declination curve which is only slightly disturbed, probably

because the needle is not sufficiently sensitive, it is seen that the greatest

disturbances are similar to and coincident in time with disturbances in
the Zi-ka-Wei horizontal force curve. The similarity between the vertical
force curves at St. Petersburg and at Stonyhurst is very striking, espe-

cially when it is considered that at Lisbon and Stonyhurst, two places
nearer together, the vertical force curves have very few coincident and

similar disturbances.

     The following table contains the Comparative Scale Values for the
curves drawn in the Plates.

   H V2 and S are expressed in millimetre- milligrammes for 1 milli-

metre, or in centimetre-grammes for 1 centimetre, i.e. thej are the values

of a centimetre (a unit of length) of the ordinate, according to the C.G.S.

system ofunits.
    From this table it appears that the same absolute disturbance will

produce changes in the ordinates of the St. Petersburg horizontal force
curve, which are more than four times the corresponding changes in the

ordinates in the Kew curve, and which are nearly six times the corre-

sponding changes in the ordinates in the Bombay curve.
     The scale-values in this table are the same as in the originals, except

in the case of Zi-ka-Wei and Toronto. The values for oH in the original

curves are -00062 millimetre-milligrammes for Zi-ka-Wei and "OOOSS for

Toronto.

   A comparison of the curves with the scale-values shows that at the

beginning of the storm on August 11 the change in the horizontal force
at Vienna was very nearly equal to the change at St. Petersburg, and
about 1^ times the change at Zi-ka-Wei ; also the changes at Melbourne,

at Zi-ka-Wei, at Toronto, and at Bombay are very nearly equal to one
another, and amount to about '0047 millimetre-milligrammes.

     Thus the amount of the disturbance does not seem to increase with
the latitude. Again, the changes occurring between 11.30 and 11.40 a.m.

amount to about

            ·016 mm.-mgr. at St. Petersburg;

            ·013                          ,,  at Vienna and at Zi-ka-Wei
            ·010                          ,,
                                              at Kew and at Toronto, but in opposite

                                              directions

            ·0084 ,, at Bombay.

Thus the absolute value of the disturbance at Bombay is not much

less than in higher latitudes, the flatness of the curve being due to the

fact that the needle is not sufficiently sensitive. On comparing the curves

with the table of scale-values, it seems clear that for magnetic storms the

most satisfactory curves for comparison and for measurement are those

which do not differ much in size from the Vienna curves, i.e. the most

satisfactory scale-value is about '0004 or 'OOOS millimetre-milligrammes

for 1 millimetre. When the scale- values are very much larger, as in the
Kew and Bombay instruments, the needles are not sensitive enough to give

the character of the disturbances, and when the scale-value is less than

about "0004 millimetre-milligrammes, the curves may have a very wide

range, and are very liable to go off" the edge of the paper.

     Great differences of practice exist at different observatories ; thus, at
St. Petersburg and at Toronto, a curve with ordinates increasing upwards

corresponds to decreasing horizontal force. This was also the case at

Vienna  in  1879                          but, from a comparison of  the curves for August 1880,
                                       ;

it appears that a change has been made by which a curve with ordinates

increasing upwards corresponds to inci'easing horizontal force. At all the

other observatories a curve with ordinates increasing upwards corresponds

to increasing horizontal force, and it would facilitate comparison if this

rule were universally observed. In the Lisbon and Coimbi'a and in the

Melbourne curves only the times of the beginning and end and one or

two other points in the curve are determined ; on this account some diffi-

culty has been found in comparing them with the others. At other obser-

vatories, at every hour or at every two hours, the time is marked by an
472 KEPOUT-- 1881.

eclipse of the liglit for either two minutes, as in the case of Vienna, or
four minutes, as at Kew, Stonj'hurst, <fec. The eclipse of the light at the
beginning of every hoar, or of every two hours, for two minutes, which is
quite long enough to mark the time, might conveniently be adopted, and
is better tban an eclipse for a longer period, if it occurs in the middle of a
storm. Also at Vienna only one curve is photographed on each sheet, and
so the difficulty is avoided of having two or more time lines with the same
hours not coincident with one another, and there is no confusion arising
from curves crossing one another.

     In the Plates the curves have been traced with great care, and set as
accurately as possible to Greenwich mean time. They have been grouped

so as to bring out prominently the common features running through

them, with the object of supplying facts on which a theory of terrestrial

magnetic disturbances may be firmly established.

     During this August storm great difficulties were experienced iu work-
ing the telegraph lines, in consequence of earth- currents, and from parti-
culars with which I have been supplied by Mr. Preece, and from the earth-
current photographic records taken at Greenwich Observatory on two

separate wires running in a S.W. and a N.W. direction, for copies of which
I am indebted to the Astronomer-Royal, it is possible to trace the connec-

tion between these magnetic storms and earth-currents.
     The photographic records at Greenwich during this storm are bent

opposite ways at the same time, so that when an earth-current is running
on one line towards Greenwich, on the other the earth-current is away
from Greenwich ; thus, when there is an earth-current on the line from
the S.W. towards Greenwich, there is found to be a current on the other
line from Greenwich towards the N.W. If the cui'rent on these lines
were absolutely equal it would indicate that the current in the crust of
the earth was in a direction from south to north. If the current from
the S.W. is greater than the current towards the N.W. it would indicate
an earth-current in a direction more nearly inclined from S.W. to N.E.

On comparing these photographic records with the earth-current records

from Derby and Haverfordwest and other places, it appears that the
general direction of currents during this storm was from about S.S.W.
to N.N.E., with varying intensity, the agreement between the distur-
bances of the declination needle and the Blackheath and Greenwich
photographic record (i.e. from S.W. to Greenwich), being very close and
in the same direction at the same time. Earth-currents were very violent
from 10.30 a.m. on the 11th to about 2.30 p.m., and again from 9 p.m.
until midnight. They were violent on August 12, beginning at 11.30
a.m., the beginning of the second storm, and quieting down about 4.30
p.m., then beginning again at 7.30 p.m. and lasting until 9.30 p.m. Again
on the 13th they were recorded as strong for about one and a half
hours from -5 a.m., i.e. just at the end of the second magnetic storm.

     The general direction of earth-currents as observed on telegraph lines,
especially at Derby and Haverfordwest, as well as at the Greenwich Ob-
servatory, was from a S.W. to a N.E. direction. During the most violent

phases of the magnetic storm, the earth-current photographic record at
Greenwich failed in consequence of the rapidity and the extent of the
swings of the galvanometer needle. Intimately connected with magnetic
disturbances and earth-currents is the phenomenon of the Aurora or Polar
Light, which is an electric discharge in the upper regions of the atmosphere.
During the August storm, and also during another violent magiietic

storm -whicli took place on January 31 last, the aurora was well seen in

England                                            it was also seen at               St.  Petei'sburg  and  as  far east  as  Siberia.
                                                ;

It does not appear to have been seen, although it was looked for, at Zi-

ka-Wei in China by M. Dechevrens, the director of the Observatory,

although the magnetic storm was so violent there that the horizontal

force was suddenly changed by -roiyth part of its total amount.

In his address before the British Association in 1863 Sir William

Armstrong speaks of the sympathy between forces operating in the sun

and magnetic forces on the earth, and notices a remarkable phenomenon

Aseen by independent observers on September 1, 1859. ' sudden out-

burst of light, far exceeding the brightness of the sun's surface, was

seen to take place, and sweep like a drifting cloud over a portion of the

solar surface. This was attended with magnetic disturbances of unusual

intensity, and with exhibitions of aurora of extraordinary' brilliancy. The

identical instant at which the effusion of light was observed was recorded

by an abrupt and strongly-marked deflection in the self-registering

instruments at Kew. The magnetic storm commenced before and con-

tinued after the event.'

The daily and yearly periods of the magnetic changes, the change

in the horizontal force depending on the sun's rotation on his axis, the

agreement of the eleven- year period of magnetic disturbances, sun-spots,

and auroras, show that the sun plays a very important part in causing or

regulating both the regular and irregular magnetic changes.

"We know so little as yet of the causes of the changes of the sun, and

their connection with terrestrial phenomena, that we can hardly do more

than ask what possible causes there are which could account for the

efiecta which are observed. Can we suppose that the Sun is a very power-

ful magnet, and that a great alteration in his magnetism accompanies

the production of the bright faculee and the spots in his atmosphere ?

Such a change of magnetism would affect the magnetism of the earth,

although the effect could not be very large, unless the sun is magnetized

to an intensity much greater, even compared to his mass, than the earth

is magnetized. Then, as there are tides in the seas around us, and pro-

bably in the earth's crust, so there are certainly very large tides in the

ocean  of  air above us                                                         and  may not the  sun  and  moon,  by  dragging this
                                                                             ;

air towards them as the earth revolves, cause that friction between air and

earth, and also that evaporation, which, together, may account for the

presence of, and keep up the supply of, positive electricity in the air and

negative electricity in the earth ? Again, these tides in the atmosphere

will cause the mass of it to lag behind the revolving solid earth, and at a

height of thirty or forty miles we have a layer of air which, for air, is a

comparatively good conductor of electricity. Here, then, we have not a

lagging of the magnet behind the conductor, but a lagging of the con-

ductor behind the magnet, and hence we may expect a current or a gradual

heaping-up of electricity in the air in the opposite direction to the current

in the earth's crust. Thus, whilst the tidal wave in the earth's crust would

cause a current in a telegraph wire from the equator towards the poles,

the regular tidal waves in the atmosphere would cause the gradual

transfer of positive electricity in the atmosphere from the poles to-

wards the equator. This transfer may be of the nature of a current of

electricity or of a mass of air carrying a static charge of electricity with

it ; for, as Professor Rowland has shown that the motion of a static charge
will produce magnetism, so we may expect, from the principles of conser-

vation of electricity, that a change in the position of a magnet will, under
snch circumstances, produce motion of the static charge of electricity.

    When the air becomes charged up to discharging point, then we may

get the sudden discharges, such as the aurora in the air and the earth-cur-
rents in the earth ; and since the conductiiig layer of air approaches nearer

--to the earth in the colder polar regions possibly within less than twenty

--miles of the earth's surface it may bo found that the discharge of the

aurora may even take place from earth to air by gradual slow discharge,
aided, as it may be, by the state of moisture, and by change of tempera-

ture, and other causes.

     In addition to the European stations the principal Observatories for

photographic registi-ation of the magnetic elements are at Toronto, Zi-

ka-Wei, Bombay, and Melbourne. The fact that there are so fcAv such
Observatories will be sufficient to show how important it is that there

--should be additional Magnetic Observatories more especially in America,

in the eastern parts of Siberia, and in the southern hemisphere. Practi-
cally we have to rely on one excellent Observatory (Melbourne) for the

whole of the southern hemisphere. Seeing that the Fi-ench Government
have decided to establish a Magnetic Observatory at Cape Horn next
year, where photographic records of the changes of the magnetic elements

are to be taken, surely it is time that a fully-equipped Magnetic Observatory
should be established at the Cape of Good Hope, where there is already an
excellent Astronomical Observatory and a staff of observers ready to

carry on the work.

On some applications of Electric Energy to Horticultural and
  Agricultural purposes, by C. Wm. Siemens, D.G.L., LL.D.^
   F.R.S., Mem. Inst. C.E.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be i^rinted in extenso
                                        among the Reports.]

On March 1, 1880, I communicated to the Royal Society a paper ' On

the influence of electric light upon vegetation, &c.,' in which I arrived at

the conclusion that electric light was capable of producing upon plants

effects comparable to those of solar radiation ; that chlorophyl was pro-

duced by it, and that bloom and fruit rich in colour and aroma could be

Mydeveloped by its aid.  experiments also went to prove that plants do

not as a rule require a period of rest during the twenty-four hours of the

day, but make increased and vigorous progress if subjected (in winter

time) to solar light during the day and to electric light during the

night.

Dui'ing the whole of last winter I continued my experiments on an

myenlai'ged scale, and it is  present  purpose  to  give  a  short  account  of

these experiments, and of some further applications of electric energy to

farming operations (incliiding the pumping of water, the sawing of

timber, and chaff- and root-cutting) at various distances not exceeding

half a mile from the source of power, giving useful employment during-

day-time to the power-producing machinery, and thus reducing in-

directly the cost of the light during night-time.
   ON SOME APrLICATIONS OF ELECTRIC ENEKGY.  475

        The arrangement consists of a higli-pressnre steam-engine of six
   horse-power nominal, supplied by Messrs. Tangye Brothers, which gives
   motion to two dynamo-machines (Siemens D), connected separately to
   two electric lamps, each capable of emitting a light of about 4,000 candle-
   power. One of these lamps was placed inside a glass house of 2,318
   cubic feet capacity, and the other was suspended at a height of twelve to
   fourteen feet, over some sunk greenhouses. The waste steam of the
   engine was condensed in a heater, whence the greenhouses take their

   circulating supply of hot water, thus saving the fuel that would other-

   wise be required to heat the stoves.

        The experiments were commenced on October 28, 1880, and were

   continued till May 7, 1881. The general plan of operation consisted in

   lighting the electric lights at first at six o'clock, and during the short
   days at five o'clock every evening except Sunday, continuing their action
   until dawn.

        The outside Hght was protected by a clear glass lantern, whilst the

   light inside the house was left naked in the earlier experiments, one of

   my objects being to ascertain the relative eSect of the light under these

   two conditions. The inside light was placed at one side over the entrance

   into the house, in front of a metallic reflector to save the rays that would
   otherwise be lost to the plants within the house.

        The house was planted in the first place with peas, French beans,
   wheat, barley and oats, as well as with cauliflowers, strawberries, rasp-

   berries, peaches, tomatoes, vines, and a variety of flowering plants
   including roses, rhododendrons and azaleas, all these plants being of a
   comparatively hardy character ; the temperature in this house was main-

   tained as nearly as possible at 60° Fahr.

        The early effects observed wei-e anything but satisfactory. While
   under the influence of the light suspended in the open air, over the sunk

   houses, the beneficial effects due to the electric light, observed during the

   previous winter, repeated themselves, the plants in the house with the

   naked electric light soon manifested a withered appearance. Was this

   result the effect of the naked light, or was it the effect of the chemical

   -- --products nitrogenous compounds and carbonic acid which are produced

   in the electric arc ?

        Proceeding on the first-named assumption, and with a view of soften-
   ing the ray of the electric arc, small jets of steam were introduced into
   the house through tubes, drawing in atmospheric air with the steam,
   and producing the effect of clouds interposing themselves in an irregular
   fashion between the light and the plants. This treatment was decidedly

   beneficial to the plants, although care had to be taken not to increase the
   amount of moisture thus introduced beyond certain limits. As regards

   -- --the chemical products carbonic acid and nitrogenous compounds it

   was thought that these would prove rather beneficial than otherwise
   in furnishing the very ingredients upon which plant-life depends, and
   further that the constant supply of pure carbonic acid resulting from the
   gradual combustion of the carbon electrodes, might render a diminution
   in the supply of fresh air possible, and thus lead to economy of fuel.
   The plants did not, however, take kindly to these innovations in their
   mode of life, and it was found necessary to put a lantern of clear glass
   round the light, for the double purpose of discharging the chemical
   products of the arc, and of interposing an effectual screen between the
   arc and the plants under its influence.

k
--476 REPORT 1881.

     The effect of interposing a mere thin sheet of clear glass between the

plants and the sonrce of electric light was most striking. On placing

such a sheet of clear glass so as to intercept the rays of the electric light

-- --from a portion only of a plant for instance, a tomato plant it was

observed that in the course of a single night the line of demarcation was
most distinctly shown upon the leaves. The portion of the plant under
the direct influence of the naked electric light, though at a distance from
it of nine to ten feet, wa.s shrivelled, whereas that portion under cover of
the clear glass, continued to show a healthy appearance, and this line of

--demarcation was distinctly visible on individual leaves not only the

leaves but the young stems of the plants soon showed signs of destruction
when exposed to the naked electric light, and these destructive in-
fluences were perceptible, though in a less marked degree, at a distance
of twenty feet from the source of light.

   A question here presents itself that can hardly fail to excite the

interest of the physiological botanist. The clear glass does not appar-
ently intercept any of the luminous rays, which cannot therefore be the
cause of the destructive action. Professor G. Gr. Stokes showed, how-

ever, in 1853, that the electric arc is particularly rich in highly refrangible
invisible rays, and that these are largely absorbed in their passage

through clear glass ; it therefore appears reasonable to siippose that it is

those highly refrangible rays beyond the visible spectrum that work
destruction on vegetable cells ; thus contrasting with the luminous rays
of less refrangibility, which, on the contrary, stimulate their organic

action.

     Being desirous to follow up this inquiry a little further, I sowed a
portion of the ground in the experimental conservatory with mustard
and other quick-growing seeds, and divided the field into equal radial
portions by means of a framework, excluding diffused light but admitting
light at equal distances from the electric arc. The first section was
under the action of the naked light, the second was covered with a pane
of clear glass, the third with yellow glass, the fourth with red, and the
fifth with blue glass. The I'elative progress of the plants was noted from
day to day, and the difierences of effect upon the development of the
plants was sufficiently striking to justify the following conclusions : viz.,
under the clear glass the largest amount of and most vigorous growth
was induced; the yellow glass came next in order, but the plants, though
nearly equal in size, were greatly inferior in colour and thickness of stem
to those under the clear glass ; the I'ed glass gives rise to lanky growth
and yellowish leaf, while the blue glass produces still more lanky growth
and sickly leaf. The uncovered compartment showed a stunted growth,
with a very dark and partly shrivelled leaf in the case of mustard,
whereas tender-leaved plants, such as cress and salad, were completely

 destroyed.

      It should be observed that the electric light was kept on from 5 p.m.
 till 6 a.m. every night except Sundays during the experiment, which took
place in January 1881, but that diffused daylight was not excluded during
 the intervals, also that circulation of air through the dividing framework
 was provided for.

     These results are confirmatory of those obtained by Dr. J. W. Draper

 in his valuable researches on plant-life in the solar spectrum in 1843,'
 which led him to the conclusion, in opposition to the then prevailing

        --' See Scientijic Memoirs by J. W. Draper, M.D., LL.D. Memoir X.

opinioB, tliafc the yellow ray and not the violet ray was most efficacious in

promoting the decomposition of carbonic acid in the vegetable cell.

Having, in consequence of these preliminary inquiries, determined to

surround the electric arc with a clear glass lantern, more satisfactory

results were soon observable. Thus, peas which had been sown at the

end of October, produced a harvest of ripe fruit on February 16,
under the influence, with the exception of Sunday nights, of continuous

light. Raspberry stalks, put into the house on December 16th, pro-

duced ripe fruit on the 1st of March, and strawberry plants, put in about

the same time, produced T'ipe fruit of excellent flavour and colour on Feb-

ruary 14. Vines which broke on December 26, produced ripe gi'apes of
stronger flavour than usual on March 10. Wheat, barley, and oats shot

up with extraordinary rapidity under the influence of continuous light,

but did not arrive at maturity ; their growth having been too rapid for
their strength, caused them to fall to the ground, after having attained

the height of about twelve inches.

Seeds of wheat, barley, and oats planted in the open air, and grown

under the influence of the external electric light, produced, however, more

satisfactory results ; having been sown in rows on January 6, they ger-
minated with difficulty on account of frost and snow on the ground, but
developed rapidly when milder weather set in, and showed ripe grain by

the end of June, having been aided in their growth by the electi-ic light

until the beginning of May.

Doubts have been expressed by some botanists whether plants grown

and brought to matui'ity under the influence of continuous light would

produce fruit capable of reproduction, and in order to test this question,

the peas gathered on February 16 from the plants which had been grown

under almost continuous light-action, were replanted on February 18.
They vegetated in a few days, showing every appearance of healthy

gi'owth.

     Further evidence on the same question will be obtained by Dr.
Gilbert, F.R.S., who has undertaken to experiment upon the wheat,

barley, and oats grown as above stated ; but still more evidence will

pi'obably be required before all doubt on the subject can be allayed.

    I am aware that the great weight of the opinion of Dr. Darwin goes
in favour of the view that many plants, if not all of them, require diurnal

rest for their normal development. In his great work on ' The Movements

of Plants ' he deals in reality with plant life as it exists under the

alternating  influence  of solar  light  and  darkness                                     he  investigates  with
                                                                                        ;

astonishing precision and minuteness their natural movements of circum-

nutation and nightly or nyctitropic action, but does not extend his

inquiries to the conditions resulting from continuoiTS light. He clearly

proves that nyctitropic action is instituted to protect the delicate leaf-cells
of plants from refrigeration by radiation into space, but it does not follow,

I would submit, that this protecting power involves the necessity of the

hurtful influence. May it not rather be inferred from Dr. Darwin's

investigations that the absence of light during night-time involved a

difficulty to plant life that had to be met by special motor organs, which

latter would perhaps be gradually dispensed with by plants if exposed to

continual light for some years or generations ?

     It is with great diffidence, and without wishing to generalise, that I

feel bound to state, as the result of all my experiments, extending now over

two winters, that although periodic darkness evidently favours growth in
--478 BEPOET 1881.

the sense of elongating the stalks of plants, the continnons stimulus of
light appears favourable for healthy development at a greatly accelerated

pace, through all the stages of the annual life of the plant, from the
early leaf to the ripened fruit. The latter is superior in size, in aroma,
and in colour to that produced by alternating light, and the resulting
seeds are not at any rate devoid of re-germinating power.

    Further experiments are necessary, I am aware, before it would be safe

to generalize ; nor does this question of diurnal rest in any way bear upon

that of annual or winter rest, which probably most plants that are not so-

called annuals, do require.
     The beneficial influence of the electric light has been very manifest

upon a banana palm, which at two periods of its existence, viz., during
its early growth, and at the time of the fruit-development, was placed (in
February and March of 1880 and 1881) under the night action of one of
the electric lights, set behind glass at a distance not exceeding two yards
from the plant ; the result was a bunch of fruit weighing seventy-five
pounds, each banana being of unusual size, and pronounced by competent
judges unsurpassed in flavour. Melons, also remarkable for size and
aromatic flavour, have been produced under the influence of continuous

light in the early spring of 1880 and 1881, and I am confident that still
better results may be realised when the best conditions of temperature and

of proximity to the electric light have been thoroughly investigated.
      j\Iy object hitherto has rather been to ascertain the general conditions

necessary to promote growth by the aid of the electric light, than the pro-

duction of quantitative results ; but I am disposed to think that the time is

not far distant when the electric light will be found a valuable adjunct to
the means at the disposal of the hoi'ticulturist, in making him really in-
dependent of climate and season, and furnishing him with a power of
producing new varieties.

      Before electro-horticulture can be entertained as a practical process it

would be necessary, however, to prove its cost, and my experiments of last

winter have been in part dii-ected towards that object. Where water-

power is available, the electric light can be produced at an extremely
moderate cost, comprising : carbon electrodes, wear and tear of, and
interest upon apparatus and machinery emploj^ed, which experience else-
where has already shown to amount to 6cl. per hour for a light of 5,000
candles. The personal attention requisite in that case consists simply in
replacing the carbon electrodes evei'y six or eight hours, which can be
done without appreciable expense by the under-gardener in charge of the

fires of the green-houses.

    In my case no natural source of power was available, and a steam-

engine had to be resorted to. The engine of six nominal horse-power
winch I employ to work the two electric lights of 5,000 candle-power each,

--consumes fifty-six pounds of coal per hour, the engine being of the ordinaiy

high-pressure type, which, taken at 20s. a ton, would amount to 6d., or
to 3d. per light of 5,000 candles. But against this expenditure has to be

placed the saving of fuel effected in suppressing the stoves for heating the

greenhouses, the amount of which I have not been able to ascertain ac-

curately, but it may safely be taken at two-thirds of the cost of coal for the

engine, thus I'educing the cost of the fuel per light to Id. per hour ; the

+total cost per light of 5,000 candles will thus amount to 6d. ld.^7d. per

 hour.

      This calculation would hold good if the electric light and engine-
ON SOMK APPLICATIONS OF ELECTRIC ENERaY.  479

power were required during, say, twelve hours jjer diem, but inasmucli as
+he light is not required during the day-time, and the firing of the boiler
nas nevertheless to be kept up in order to supply heat to the greenhouses,
it appears that during the day-time an amount of motive power is lost
equal to that employed during the night.

     In order to utilise this power I have devised means of working the
dynamo-machine also during the daytime, and of transmitting the electric
energy thus produced by means of wires to different points of the farm,
where such operations as chaff-cutting, swede- slicing, timber-sawing, and
water-pumping have to be performed.

     These objects are accomplished by means of small dynamo-machines,
placed at the points where power is required for these various purposes,
and which are in metallic connection with the current-generating dynamo-
machine near the engine. The connecting wires employed consist each
of a naked strand of copper wire, supported on wooden poles or on trees
without the use of insulators, whilst the return circuit is effected through

the park-railing or wire fencing of the place, which is connected with
both transmitting and working machines by means of short pieces of con-

necting wire. In order to insure the metallic continuity of the Avire

fencing, care has to taken, wherever there are gates, to solder a piece of
wire, buried below the gates, to the wire fencing on either side.

     As regards pumping the water, a 3 horse-power steam-engine was origi-
nally used, working two force pumps of 3^ inches diameter, making thirty-
six double strokes per minute. The same pumps are still employed, being

now worked by a dynamo-machine weighing 4 cwt. When the cisterns

at the house, the gardens, and the farm require filling, the pumps are
started by simply turning the communicator at the engine station, and
in like manner the mechanical operations of the farm already referred to
are accomplished by one and the same prime mover.

     There would be difficulty in this instance in stating accurately the
percentage of power actually received at the distant station, but in trying
the same machines under similar circumstances of resistance, with the aid

of dynamometers, as much as sixty per cent, has been realised.

     In conclusion, I have pleasure in stating that the working of the elec-
tric light, and the transmission of power for the various operations just

named, are entirely tinder the charge of my head gardener, Mr. Buchanan,

assisted by the ordinary staff of under-gardeners and field-labourers, who

probably never before heard of the power of electricity.

    Electric transmission of power may eventually be applied also to

thrashing, reaping, and ploughing. These objects are at the present
time accomplished to a large extent by means of portable steam-engines,
a class of engine which has attained a high degree of perfection ; but the
electric motor presents the great advantage of lightness, its weight per
horse-power being only 2 cwt., whilst the weight of a portable engine

with its boiler filled with water may be taken at 16 cwt. per horse-power.

Moreover the portable steam-engine requires a continuous supply of
water and fuel, and involves skilled labour in the field, whilst the elec-
trical engine receives its food through the wire (or a light rail upon

which it may be made to move about) , from the central station, where

power can be produced at a cheaper rate of expenditure, for fuel and

labour, than in the field. The use of secondary batteries may also be re-
sorted to with advantage to store electrical energy when it cannot be

utilised.

           REPORT 1881.

   In tlius accomplisliing the work of a farm from a central-power station,

considerable savings of plant and labour may be effected ; the engine-power

will be chiefly required for day work, and its night work, for the purposes
of electro-horticulture, will be a secondary utilisation of the establishment
involving little extra expense. At the same time the means are provided
of lighting the hall and shrubberies in the most perfect manner, and of
producing effects in landscape gardening that are strikingly beautiful.

    Since writing the above my attention has been called to a very

interesting Report entitled ' Researches on the Influence of the Solar
Rays on the Growth of Plants ' communicated to the Oxford Meeting of
the British Association in 1847, by Mr. Robert Hunt, F.R.S., towards the
end of which he gives the following as the conclusions arrived at.

      1. Light prevents the germination of seeds.

      2. Actinism quickens germination.
     3. Light acts to effect the decomposition of carbonic acid by the

growing plant.
     4. Actinism and light are essential to the formation of the colouring

matter of leaves.
     5. Light and actinism, independent of calorific rays, prevent the

development of the reproductive organs of plants.
     6. The heat-radiations corresponding with the extreme red rays of

the spectrum facilitate the flowering of plants and the perfecting of their

reproductive principles.

The recent failures of the Tay Bridge and other important structures
during heavy gales of wind, have attracted much attention to the subject
of this paper. The general solution of the problem may be thus briefly
stated :--

   =Let V the velocity of the current in feet per second.
       =h the height through which a heavy body must fall to produce

                        the velocity v.

instruments in use are little better than ptilosophical toys, and that, in
general, they afford no direct, comparable, or reliable indications of either
velocities or pressures ; and that they are often so injudiciously placed as
in some instances to i-ecord the effects of combined and, therefore, locally
accelerated currents ; whilst in other instances, they record only the

effects of obstructed and, therefore, locally retarded currents.

     As the acquisition of accurate data is of great and increasing-
importance, the author suggests that the British Association, and other

learned societies interested in physical investigations, should unite in
providing the necessary funds and observers for the purpose.

On the Island of Socotra. By Bayley Balfour, Sc.D., M.B., Regius

                  Professor of Botany, University of Olasgoiv.

     [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                             among the reports.]

     The island of Socotra lies off the N.E. corner of Africa in lat. 12°
19' to 12° 42', and long. 53^ 20' to 54° 30'. Its extreme length from
east to west is about 72 mdes, and its breadth about 22 miles.

    From Cape Guardafui 140 miles, it is a little more distant from the
Arabian Coast (about 500 miles from Aden), and still further away from

the Indian Peninsula.
     It is the most easterly elevation of land on a coral bank lying to the

N.E. of Africa, upon which, between it and Cape Guardafui, other islands

--(Abd-al-Kuri, Kal Farun, Samheh and Darzi known commonly as The

Brothers, and Saboynea) of smaller size occur. On no part of this bank

is the depth of water over 200 fathoms, but between it and the African
coast is a channel reaching 500 fathoms. Around Socotra is a narrow

coral reef.

     Perhaps no island of like extent, and lying, as one may say, on the
threshold of civilisation, has remained in later times so generally unknown
as Socotra. Situated on the highway of traffic to the East by way of
Suez and the Red Sea, it is almost invariably sighted by steamers making
for or from the Gulf of Aden, and thus to those who have passed along
this route, its locality, or at least its name, will be known. To the scien-

tific world it has been familiar as the country of a kind of aloes, the

designation of which as Socotrine, has by some been traced to the name of
the island. But to the majority of people its existence and its name are
alike unknown, or at most it is associated in a vague sort of way with the

East Indies.

     The causes for this are not difiBcult to discover. The extreme outlying

land in this region of the Indian Ocean, the island is exposed to the full
blast of the monsoons, however they blow, and possessing no hai'bour in
which a ship can at all times ride safely at anchor, it offers no induce-

ments to ships seeking shelter. Then the currents which sweep past its
shores run with considerable force into the Gulf of Aden, and there have
been several shipwrecks on it, as well as on the African coast adjacent
the high hills of the island being easily mistaken for the mainland, and vice

--versa and navigation in its vicinity is altogether somewhat hazardous.

It is not surprising, therefore, that passing vessels avoid the island as

mucli as possible. Moreover, too, the want of intercourse with the island,
and consequent ignorance regarding its inhabitants, have given currency
to various rumours not favourable to their character, which, though quite
unwarranted, yet have had their influence in preserving Socotra as a
vir'gin and unexplored island in the pathway of civilisation.

    Its position on the direct route to India is one of far too much im-

portance to have allowed its remaining so neglected had any natural
advantages obtained, permitting of its being utilised, or had there been no
obstacles. Strategically valuable as is Aden, our station in this region,
its barren waterless soil would place it at a great disadvantage, com-
pared with an island possessing a rich soil and plentiful water-supply,
such as Socotra, did it possess the other elements necessary for becoming a
military station. But it has been tried and found wanting. Its history

shows how at various periods its importance has been recognised, and
certainly its present backward condition can hardly be ascribed to want

of attempts to settle or to colonise it.
     Its history is one of considerable interest. I do not purpose here

to give in detail an account of the early history of the island. Suffice
it that I briefly notice some of its leading vicissitudes up to the time

when our expedition was first projected at this Association. The island
seems to have been known to Europeans at an early period under the

--name of Dioscoris or Dioscorida, a name traced by some to a Sanskrit

root signifying ' abode of bliss ; by others to two Arabic words meaning
                                                                                                                                                                  '

* island of dragon's-blood ' (Jcdtir being the Arabic name for this
gum). The author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea refers to it as a
desolate island inhabited by a mixed population of Arabs, Indians, and
Greeks, all speaking Greek, who had come thither in search of grain, and
carried on a trade with the "West Coast of India and with Mokha. The
island is frequently mentioned by the early Arab geographers, who account
for the Greek population by the story, which Colonel Yule considers a

myth, that Alexander the Great, acting on the advice of Aristotle, settled
an loniair colony there, in order to cultivate the aloe. They further state
that the Greeks and other inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and
that clergy from Persia regularly visited the island. The population at

this time, a few centuries after the Christian era, is put down by

some at as much as 10,000, the majority of whom are desci'ibed as

Nestorian Christians and pirates.
     In the time of Marco Polo, towards the end of the thirteenth century,

the island was a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church. Many ships
visited the island, all vessels for Aden touching there, and the trade was

mainly in ambergris, cotton stuS's, and salt fish. The people had the
reputation of being enchanters, and of being able at will to raise the wind,
to bring back ships, and to produce storms and disasters.

     Although so mixed a population lived on the island, yet from the
earliest times it appears to have been under the rule of the Mahra tribe,
dwelling on the opposite side of Arabia, whose sultan or sheikh lived at

Keshin.
      In 1503 Fernandez Pereira discovered it for the Portuguese, at which

time an Arab sheikh lived in a fort at Zoko (modern Suk), the then
capital of the island ; but it was not until 1507 that Tristan da Cunha
and Albuqerque captured the island for the Portuguese. After four years'
occupancy the Portuguese retired from the island, leaving abundant traces
of their presence. The remains of a fort on Hadibu plain, and at various

places on the S. and S.W. sides of the island, are most substantial ruins.
Besides that their influence is possibly seen in such names of jjlaces as

Derafonta and Feraigey, the name of one of the ruined forts, which may
be Feringee. And indeed the dialect of Socotra may, it is thought by

some, owe part of its peculiaritj^ to a Portuguese basis. Moreover, at

the present time, a large section of the inhabitants of the hill-region of

the island claim direct descent from the Portuguese. About this date the
character of the Christianity had somewhat changed, and they professed

the doctrines of the Jacobite sect.

The evacuation by the Portuguese allowed a return of the Sultan of

Keshin, and in his hands it has ever since remained, with the exception of

--a short occupancy on three several occasions by a foreign race in 1538

by the Turks, in 1800 bv the Wahabbees, and by the British from 1834

to 1839.

    Although the ships of the East Indian Company frequently called at

the island during the seventeenth century, some meeting with a friendly

reception, others finding the reverse, and carried on a small trade in aloes

and dragon's-blood (the stormy weather seems always to have been a

source of dread), it was not until the year 1800 that affairs in the East

directed the attention of the British Government to Socotra as a desirable
possession, and the Commander of the naval station in that region

was directed to seize it. This was not done, and it was not until 1834
that the necessity for a coaling station induced the Indian Government

to survey the island. This was accomplished by Captain Haines and

Lieutenant Wellsted, and the result of the survey being satisfactory, the

Government attempted to buy the island, but failing to do so it was

seized in 1835 by Indian troops. Aden having been taken in 1839, and

being more suitable as a coaling depot, Socotra was abandoned.

     The exploration of the island by Wellsted supplied us with the first,
and indeed until now only detailed account of the island, its people, and
productions.' The only available chart at present is the one made during

this exploration, and it is most imperfect.

     After the abandonment by the British in 1839, there is no record of

Europeans visiting regularly the island. An occasional shipwreck brought

it into notice, but it was not until 1876 that a prospect of the island being

occupied by another power caused the British Government to turn atten-

tion to Socotra, with the result that in that year a treaty was concluded

with the Sultan, by which he binds himself, and his heirs and successors,

' amongst other things, to protect any vessel, foreign or British, with the

crew, passengers, and cargo, that may be wrecked on the island of Socotra

or its dependencies, and he receives an annual stipend of 360 dollars for this.'
The other things, it is understood, include a promise never to cede Socotra

to a foreign power, or to allow a settlement on it without consent of the
British Government. Thus the Sultan becomes a feudatory of Britain.

The attention of naturalists had long been directed to Socotra as a

field for investigation whence rich results might be obtained, and Captain

Hunter, who had visited the island in connection with the concluding

of the treaty just mentioned, having brought back most encouraging

accounts. Dr. Sclater in 1878 bi'onght the matter prominently before this

   of the natural history of the island. Various causes delayed the sending

   out of the expedition, and it was not until January, 1879, that I left this
   country, returning again in April, having spent, with two companions
   Lieutenant Cockijui'n, 6th Royals, whose regiment was at Aden, and

   --Alexander Scott, a gardener from the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh,

   who accompanied me from England nearly seven weeks on the island.

   At the meeting of this Association at Swansea last year, a report

    of the proceedings of the expedition was read, and is printed in the
    Association Reports. At that time the collections brought home were

   . only in course of distribution for examination. Now a certain portion of

    them has been worked out, although the whole is not completed, and I

   purpose to-day to lay before the Association a brief account of the island

   as we saw it, and the results of our investigations so far as they have been
   carried out. Ere doing so I have one remark to make. Although so long
   a period elapsed between the evacuation of the island by the British and

   the date of our expedition last year, yet we have already been followed to
   the island (though the fact of our visit was not known to them) by the
   German traveller and botanist Dr. Schwcinfurth, and some companions.

   They went in early spring of this year, and returned in May, having had,
   unfortunately, bad voyages both going and returning. Thus, after an
   interval of forty years, Socotra has been visited in two successive years by
   exploring parties. But what I desire to make public just now is this,

   that Dr. Schwcinfurth, on learning that I had been to Socotra, at once

   offered to send to me his botanical collections, to be worked up along

   --with my own an act of generosity which I think deserves the fullest

   recognition, and which will enable me to bring out a much more complete

   account of the botany of the island.

        The surface features of Socotra at the present time are those of an

   island mountainous in the extreme. The shore line on its southern aspect

   is, as the map shows, a tolerably continuous one, unbroken by deep inlets
   or bays. On the northern side occur a few shallow bays at the mouths

   of the streams, which afford the only anchorage to be obtained around

   the island, but no one of them is safe at all seasons of the year. On all

   sides the hills rise with considerable abruptness, over a wide area
   forming bold perpendicular cliiis of several hundred feet in height, whose

   base is washed  by the waters  of  the  Indian Ocean                                                                 but  at  other places
                                                                                                                     ;

   leaving plains varying in breadth up to as much as five miles between

   their base and the shore. On the south side of the island is the largest

   -- --of these shore plains Nogad which, extending nearly the whole length of

   the island, is for miles covered with dunes of blown sand. On the north

   these plains occur chiefly at the moutlis of the streams, and are the sites

   of the only places which may be called towns.

   The internal hilly part of the island may be roughly and shortly

   described as a wide undulating and intersected limestone plateau of an

I  altitude averaging 1,000 feet, which flanks on the west, south, and east
   a nucleus of granitic peaks approaching 4,000 feet high. The whole of

   this hilly region is deeply cut into by ravines and valleys. These in the

   rainy season are occupied by roaring torrents, but the majority of them

   remain empty during the dry season. There are, however, many peren-

   nial streams on the island ; especially in the central granitic region,
   where amongst the hills the most charming bubbling streams, dashing
   over boulders in a series of cascades, or purling gently over a pebbly

   shingle, make it hard to believe that one is in such proximity to the desert
486 EEPORT-- 1881.

--region of Arabia. Few of the perennial streams reach the shore in the

dry season most of them are fiumaras.
     The eastern end of the island is most destitute of water. Here in

the dry season are no rivers, and, springs being rare, it is the most arid

region.

      Igneons, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks compose the island.
The fundamental rock is granitic. This crops out, as I have mentioned,
towards the middle of the island, forming a series of bare pinnacles and
crags, projecting, with singularly fantastic look, from the plateau, below.
This rock also shows on the slopes of the valleys and ravines below the
compact limestone which caps it and forms the surface rock of the hill
plateaux. This limestone attains in places, as seen on the cliff faces, a
thickness of two or three hundred feet. Superficially over wide areas it
is rotted and broken into a jagged surface, over which progression is by

Ano means easy, while at other spots it forms broad, smooth slabs. shaley

rock and coarse-textnred purple sandstone, in beds dipping at all angles,
crop out in the valleys and on the shore, whilst forming the shore-plains
and the bases of the valleys is a recent breccia and conglomerate. Cutting
through all these rocks and altering them to a considerable extent, occur
dykes and extensive masses of doleritic rocks and felstones, which vary

much in texture.
    Professor Bonney, who is working out the rock specimens, tells me he

has nearly completed his report, and we may therefore soon hope for

more definite knowledge of the geology of the island.
     The soil resulting from such petrological conditions is correspondingly

varied, correlated with which is a varjing character in vegetation and

scenery.

     In the valleys on the banks of the streams, especially in the granitic
region, a deep rich red soil is found, and where there is water perennially

it is covered by a luxuriant growth. As the limestone composes the
greater part of its superficies the plateau appears barren. Where,
however, the limestone has rotted, a series of nooks and crevices occur,
in which, where a soil has collected, an Aloe, Kalanclwe, or other
succulent finds a congenial habitat. But upon the limestone plateau,
especially at the eastern and western ends of the island, occur depressions
varying in width from some hundi-ed yards up to a mile or more, girt on
every side by the cavernous limestone cliff, with perhaps a narrow outlet
through it at one or more points. These, which have all the appearance
of lagoons, or at least of enclosed water-basins, are floored now by a rich
red soil on which a crop of coarse grass, small herbs, and low trees vege-
tates. On the shore-plains the soil is light and sandy.

      In its climate Socotra contrasts favourably with the adjacent shores
of Arabia and Africa.

     During the N.B. monsooD, from October to April, it is cool. January
and February are the most pleasant months. But during the rest of the
year it is exceedingly disagreeable. Rain falls twice in the year, at the
changes of the monsoons, at which times the stream-courses are filled

with mighty torrents. The temperature of course varies much with the
altitude, and one may pass in the course of a few hours from the tropical

heat of the shore plains to the cool temperate air of the mountain ranges.
The average temperature on the plains in January is said to be about 70°,

but in the hotter months it is as much as 86°. But on the plateau the
temperature at nights often goes down to 52°. The higlier peaks are, at

least in the cool season, frequently enshrouded in mists, and at night

very heavy dews fall.  The climate on the hills is very healthy                                                                                                                                                   but on

the plains, especially at the changes of monsoon, fever is j^revalent.

       Of zoological features one of the most striking is the paucity of

indigenous mammals. The antelopes and rodents of the adjacent continents

are absent from Socotra, and there are but two mammals indigenous : a

-- --bat of which, unfortunately, we did not obtain a specimen and a civet

cat. Rats and mice occur in the villages. Of the cassowary, mentioned

by Wellsted, we saw and heard nothing. Birds are plentiful, so are

lizards, and there are some snakes. The rivers are stocked with fish,

and in them crabs are also found in abundance. Land moUusca are, as

might be expected, frequent, and the whole island teems with insect

life.

     Our collections have been pretty nearly fully worked out. Mr. Sclater
and Dr. Hartlaub have done the birds. Dr. Gunther has taken the snakes,
and Mr. Blanford the lizards. The shells have fallen to Colonel Godwin-

Austen, and Mr. Butler and Mr. Waterhouse have respectively worked

out the Lepidoptera and Coleoptera; all their results being published

in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society' for 1881. Though the

collections are very fragmentary, yet they present features of interest,

and show that whilst the fauna of Socotra possesses a fair amount of
individuality, it is distinctly African in character. The specimens are
too few in number to allow an estimate of the extent of the endemic

fauna to be made, nor will that be practicable, as Mr. Sclater points

out, until we learn something more of the zoology of the African coast

around Cape Guardafui, which at present is almost unknown. The con-

clusions, however, that may be drawn from our present knowledge of the

fauna of Socotra may be best expressed in the words of Colonel Godwin-

Austen when speaking of the affinities of the land moUusca : ' Thei^e

is strong evidence that the island was once directly connected with Mada-

Wegascar to the south.  know the great antiquity of that island, and it

is not unreasonable to suppose that in Socotra, the Seychelles, Mada-
gascar, and Rodriguez we have the remnants of a very ancient, more

advanced coast line on this western side of the Indian Ocean, which line

of elevation was jDrobably continuous through Arabia towards the north.
With an equally advanced coast on the Indian side, the Arabian Sea would
under these conditions have formed either a great delta or a narrow arm

of the sea, into which the waters of the Indus and Euphrates drained.
Such conditions would have admitted the extension of species from one
side to the other, which the later and more extensive depression of the
area, as shown in Scinde, afterwards more completely shut off.'

   --Of domesticated animals there are on Socotra cattle, sheep, goats,

camels, and asses. Old voyagers speak of horses being used, but there
are none now. The cattle are small and have no hump. Immense herds
are found at the east end of the island. The sheep are all fleeced, but
there are none of the Berbera kind. Of goats there are some in a wild

condition. The camels are much smaller than those at Aden and else-
where in Arabia, and are able to climb like goats ; many are kept for

milking. Asses roam wild in herds all over the island.
     The vegetation of the island varies in aspect with the character of the

rocks. Starting from the shore one finds no representative of a marine

phrenogamic vegetation, although in the stagnant brackish waters at

the mouths of the streams naiads occur. The coast is not favourable for
488 EEPOET-- T881.

seaweeds, being too sliingly and sandy. On the dry sandy plains the

vegetation typical of the desert regions on the mainland reigns. Small-

leaved, stunted, and woody bushes and herbs, often so rigid as to become

spiny, or fleshy plants without foliage-leaves prevail. Leaving the plains,

and passing to the hill slopes and valleys, plant life is more vigorous,

but in no place sufficiently so to call for the designation of forest, nor

is there anything in the way of fine timber. But in the valleys, wherever

there is any degree of moisture, small trees of some 20 to 25 feet, Avith

smaller shrubs packed so densely as to exclude the light from above,

linked together by far-reaching lianes, and underlain by a thick under-

scrub of fern and herb, make an almost impenetrable thicket, and produce

a verdure quite tropical in its luxuriance. Once out of the valleys

upon the plateaux and the scene is essentially different. Wide barren

stretches of grey limestone extend on every side unrelieved, save by an

isolated Draccena, or tree Euphorbia of stiff erect habit, looking like

the  remnant  of the                                                   vegetation  of some  old  geological  epoch                              or where
                                                                                                                                             ;

a lake-like depression, with its brown earth sparingly coated with

green herbage, intervenes. And again, reaching the higher altitudes

on the granitic range, the vegetation impresses one at once with its sub-

temperate character. The arborescent type has almost entirely dis-

appeared. Twiggy, narrow-leaved herbs form a dense deep carpet on

the soil, interrupted here and there by a j^rotruding lichen-covered

boulder, and for all the world like the covering of heather on a Scottish

moor ; whilst within the shade of the boulders, or in the moisture of the

overhanging clifis in the ravines, bright green herbs nestle in beds of liver-

wort and moss, so that it would requii'e no very great effort to believe one

was exploring an Alpine crag in a temperate region.

     Aromatic odours are a marked feature of many plants, and also the

occurrence of gums and resins, which in some cases form natural exu-

dations in the form of tears. The common desert characteristics of a

glaucous grey colouration or a hairy pubescence mark also many of the

plants on the shoi'e-plains and on the plateaux.

     I shall not give any statistics regarding the flora, nor shall I attempt

any detailed account of its affinities at the present. Our collections,

amounting to about 700 species, of which 550 at least are Phtenogams, are

only in course of being worked out, and I am daily expecting a con-

signment of this gathering from Schweinfurtb, which he tells me includes

probably 200 species, that we did not obtain, and I consider it better

therefore to delay until the materials for the estimation of the whole flora,

as we are able to know it, are at hand.

     The flora is, as you will readily believe, a pretty extensive one. There

is in it a goodly number of cosmopolitan and tropical weeds, but there

is a fair proportion of endemic genei'a and species. The orders most

abundantly represented appear to be Leguminosas and Graminea?, closely

followed by Compositae, Acanthace£e, Cyperacere, and Euphorbiaceffi.

There is a fair number of ferns, a few orchids or palms, whilst of cellular

Cryptogams lichens are exceedingly abundant.

    Of individual plants interesting for various reasons, let me merely

--mention a few,- and firstly, on morphological grounds, may be noticed

the  ' Camhane                                                  tree,  a  new  genus  of  Cucurbitaceas.  This plant differs
                                                             '

from the ordinal characters in being a tree with a stem often four or

five feet in diameter at the base, rapidly tapering, and forming a very

soft juicy wood. Another plant of interest, on morphological grounds, is
ON THE ISLAND OF SOCOTKA.  489

 a small tree bearing a fruit like a pomegranate, but instead of having the
 double row of carpels characteristic of the true Punica gravahim, there is but
 a single whorl. Can this then be the primitive type of the Pomegranate ?
 Another morphologically interesting plant is a Menisperm, a Cor.ctdus,
 which differs from the ordinal type in being a hard erect undershrub, with

 cladodes and short spiny branches.

     Gum and resin-producing plants are numerous. The most interesting

 of these is the dragon's-blood tree, Draccena Ginnabari. The dragon's-
 blood of commerce at the present time is, as is well known, the product

 of Calamus Draco of Sumatra. But the Socotran gum is the old Kivvajpapi
 mentioned by Dioscorides. It is known on the island as ' edah'; amongst

 the Arabs it is ' katir.' The plant is endemic, nearly allied to the
 D. Draco of TeneriiFe. From the other gum-producing species, D. Ombet
 of Abyssinia and D. schizantha of Somali-land, of which we have as yet

but imperfect knowledge, it is apparently quite distinct. The gum exudes

 in tears from the stem of the tree, and is collected after the rains ; the

 gatherer chipping off the tears into goat-skins. There are three forms in

--"which the gum is exported. Of these ' edah amsello,' the tears as they
--exude from the tree is the purest and most valuable form ; 2|- lbs. fetch

 one dollar. The second-best kind is called ' edah dukkah.' It consists
of the small chips and fragments of the tears which have been broken

 off in separating the gum-tears from the tree, or by attrition. It sells
at one dollar for 4 lbs. The cheapest is the ' edah mukdehah,' which
brings a dollar for 5 lbs., and is very impure. It is in the form of small

flat-sided masses, and consists of fragments of the gum and refuse of the

gatherings melted together into a flat cake, and then broken up into

smaller portions.

      Another most important gum-producing plant on the island is Aloe

Pei~ryi, which yields the ' Socotrine Aloes ' of commerce. The gum is
 known as 'tayef by the natives; the Arabs call it ' sobr.' Although

this kind of nloes has been so long known, and has the reputation of being

finer than either Barbadoes or Cape aloes, it is only within the past few
years that the character of the plant has been made known. It grows
abundantly on the island, especially on the limestone plateaux. The

collection of the gum is a very simple process, and can be accomplished

at any season. The collector scrapes a slight hollow on the surface of
the ground in the vicinity of an aloe-plant, into which he depi'esses the
centre of a small portion of goat-skin spread over the ground. The

leaves of the aloe are then cut and laid in a circle on the skin, with the

cut ends projecting over the central hollow. Two or three layers are

arranged. The juice, which is of a pale amber colour with a sweet,
slightly mawkish odour and taste, flows from the leaves into the goat-

skin. After about three hours the leaves are exhausted ; the skin
is removed from beneath them, and the contained juice transferred to

a mussock. Only the older leaves are used. The juice thus collected is
of a thin watery character, and is known as ' tayef rhiho,' or watery
aloes. In this condition it is exported to Muscat and Arabia, and sells for

seven dollars a skin of 30 lbs. In this last condition it is commonly-

exported. Althougli this i^roduction is so easily obtained, yet its

collection is most precarious, and, indeed, is only resorted to by the

inhabitants when, from -want of rain, the pasturage is not sufficient

for the cattle and sheep, and thus milk is scarce. In good seasons,

when there is abundance of milk, and they are able to make ghi sufficient

for their needs, very little aloes is obtained.

Of other gum-producing trees, a Boswellia yielding a kind of myrrh,

the ' Ameero ; ' some Balsamodendrons yielding a poor ' olibanum ; ' and

an Odina yielding a false myrrh, may be mentioned, as also an Acacia

affijrding a very good gum.

Of plants striking as having brilliant flowers may be noted the

Adenium,    from which Aden  derives  its  name                                                                                                                                                      a tuberous Begonia,  which
                                                                         ;

will shortly be introduced into horticulture; a fragant Grimim, species

of BuelUa, Jasminum, &c.

There is, as I have said, no forest on the island, and yet there is one

small tree, or large shrub, which may be of some value commercially.

It is the ' metayue,' a kind of box-tree, Buxus Hildebraiidti. It was first

found by Hildebrandt on the Somali-land hills. It forms a hai'd, compact

wood, and, I doubt not, might be used for many of the purposes for

which boxwood is so valuable at the present time. It is abundant on

the island, and Hildebrandt reported it very common in Somali-land.

I did not bring home sufficient specimens to allow of an experimental

trial of this as a material for wood-cuts or other purposes. I learn from

Dr. Schweinf urth, that he has sent some to Berlin to be tried in this way.

Should the wood prove serviceable, it requires no special mention to
indicate how valuable this product may become, in view of the exhaustion

of the boxwood forests (of which we hear so much) in the S.E. of Europe.
    Many plants are used on the island for the purposes of dyeing. But

of these the only one that need be here referred to is the orchella weed,

(Bochella tinctoria.) Occurring in abundance, it was formerly exported

in great quantity. It is known as ' shennah.'

     Few wild plants yield edible fruits ; the jujube is abundant, and there
is the tamarind and the bitter orange.

     Briefly to summarise in gejieral terms our knowledge of the Socotran

flora, we may say it is essentially that of a continental island, and presents

features indicating a considerable antiquity. The relative proportion of

families to genera and of genera to species, is large. Annuals are few

in number. In its characteristics it combines those of a dry and arid region

with those of a moister and cooler region. Its individuality is great, and

its affinities are mainly African, the closeness of relationship amounting

to actual identity between many most peculiar and typical plants. And this

affinity extends not only into the flora of the adjacent coast- line of Guardafui

and Somali-land, of which, unfortunately, our knowledge is at present

small, but still farther west into Nubia and Abyssinia, and (increasing

tenfold the interest of the floi-a) reaches also southwards through Mada-

gascar to the Cape, with the flora of which region there are some strong and

very marked connections. Arabian relationships are present in the flora,

nearly all  the Aden plants being represented                                                                                                                                                        but,  unfortunately, beyond
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the flora of Aden we know very little of the vegetation of the adjacent

Arabian region. Nor are more Eastern affinities wanting, for types of the

North Indian region have representatives in the flora.

Our president, Sir Joseph Hooker, in the able and interesting address
ON THE ISLAND OF SOCOTBA.  491

to whicli we listened on Thursday last, referred to the herbarium brought

from Central Africa by Mr. Joseph Thomson, and remarked that ' it

contained many of the endemic genera and even species of the Cape of

--Good Hope ' a fact most interesting as showing the prescience of a

suggestion made many years ago by Sir Joseph Hooker ' that the South

African flora has once been continued along the highlands of East Africa
from Natal to Abyssinia.' Mr. Baker, too, on Friday read a most valuable

paper on the flora of Madagascar, in which he pointed out the marked
African affinities of that island, and its connection with the Cape and

Central African forms.

    And now from Socotra we learn the same story, and are therefore
forced to the conclusion that we have here a remnant of an old African

flora, of which, at the present day, the Cape is the southern, Abyssinia the
northern, and this, along with Madagascar, the eastern extension.

     The botanical evidence, it will be seen, bears out in a most emphatic

manner the conclusions founded upon the fauna. From its geographical

position one would a priori be led to regard Socotra as an outlier from

the African continent, separated in the progress of cosmical change.

The whole natural history of the island geology, zoology, and botany

-- --bears out this view.

     Of plants cultivated on the island the most important is the date-palm.
Every stream on the island is lined by groves of them, and the fruit is
used, both ripe and unripe. Melons are grown, as also small onions.
Little cereal culture is indulged in. Here and there, on the hills beside
a stream, a small enclosux-e of ' bombe ' (jowari) may be seen, but the
inhabitants are too lazy to cultivate to any extent, the watering requiring
too much labour. Only in one spot was there observed an attempt at

irrigation.

     Our expedition was essentially a botanical one, and the time at our
disposal being limited, many points of interest regarding the people and
their mode of life could not be investigated. But the island does possess
great ethnological interest, as its history will have shown you, besides the
somewhat melancholy interest which, as Colonel Tule remarks, attaches
to a people once Christian, and now lapsed into a semi-barbarous condition.
I may, however, shortly bring before you some facts regarding the inha-

bitants.

     The extent of population it is impossible to estimate, as so many
people live in caves, and one only occasionally came across the wandering

inhabitants of the hill region.

     In speaking of the people, the dwellers on the shore must be dis-
tinguished from those on the hills. The former, who are a mixed population
of Arabs, Indians, and Africans of various tribes, live in small towns. Of
these at present the chief is Tamarida, on the extensive Hadibu plain at
the base of the Haggler range of hills. It is the capital of the island, and
consists of a number of stone and lime houses, of the ordinary construction
seen in Arabia, all plastei'ed outside of a dazzling white, and surrounding
a large one, which is the Sultan's palace. Around the town is a dense date-
grove. There is a mosque and well-filled graveyard in the centre of the
town. The number of inhabitants is set down at about 400. Kadhab is
another village, lying on a sandy spit east from Tamarida. The houses
here are of the same character as at Tamarida, and there is a mosque.
Gollonsir, at the west end is the penal settlement, and has but few houses.
Formerly the capital of the island was Suk, at the east edge of the Hadibu

plain, but it was destroyed. There are numerous small villages all along

the coast line, but the three mentioned are the chief towns.
     The OGCupation of the residents in these villages is mainly fishing. They

cultivate small tracts of ground near their houses, but are, as a rule, idle.

The population too is somewhat changing, many going off in trading

buggalows to Zanzibar or the Arabian coast.
     The inhabitants of the hills, 'Bedouins,' as they are called, are very

different people. They are regarded as the aborigines of tlie island, and
alone possess any great interest ethnologically. They are mostly

troglodytes, but here and there live in small huts, Avith stone and lime

walls and roofed with date-palm leaves. They are a most peaceable race

of people, and are divided into numerous families belonging to a few

Aprincipal tribes.  study of these tribes would well repay the time

and trouble spent upon it. Captain Hunter says : ' The " Karshin,"

who inhabit the western end of the island, claim to be descendants from

the Portuguese. The " Momi," who reside in the eastern end of the

island, are said to trace descent from the aborigines and the Abyssinians
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

whilst the "Camahane," who live in Haggler and the hills above the
Hadibu plain, claim to arise from the intermarriage of the aborigines

with the Mahri Arabs from the opposite coast. Whatever be their

origin, certain is it that the hill people have a very distinct appearance.

Many of them are tall and finely made, the men with broad shoulders,

lean flanks, and stout legs, reminding one very forcibly of the European

build-. Thin-lipped and straight-featured, they have straight black hair.

The women are many of them very good-looking, somewhat resembling-

gipsies, but they have rather large hands and feet.'

    The men wear a loin-cloth, one end of which is commonly thrown

over the shoulder, usually with a knife stuck in the waist, and they

invariably carry a stick. The women have the ordinary Arab blue shirt,

in most cases kilted at the knees and continued round the waist by a

girdle. In some cases, however, they improvise a petticoat of the coarse

blankets they themselves weave, and wear on the upper part of the body

a loose tunic with short sleeves. They go unveiled. The women wear

the hair done up in two plaits which hang down their back, but in front

the hair is cut to form a short fringe on the forehead. Their ornaments

are few. The men often wear an armlet of silver. The women have

necklets of amber, glass beads, dragon's-blood tears, or in some cases

rupees, and have also the ordinary Arab silver armlet, and ear-rings.

     TJie occupation of these people is chiefly pastoral. Their herds and

flocks are extensive. From the milk they make quantities of ghi by a simple

--process of churning merely continuous jerking of the skin mussocks

and they sell it to the Arabs of the coast, or exchange it for rice, dates,

or other necessaries. They collect also dragon's-blood and aloes, but the

latter only in great amount when jiasturage fails them. The women spin

a coarse thread from the sheep's wool, which they weave into blankets.
     They live very miserably. Milk forms a large portion of their diet.

Bombe is used when grown. Rice is obtained from the coast Arabs.
Date is a staple of food. On great occasions a sheep or a kid is kiUed.

     The furnishino- of their dwellings is verv meaere. Blankets are their

couches. Goat-skm mussocks are used for water and milk. They have

also earthenware pots, moulded by the hand out of the clays and silica of

adjacent rocks.

Their language is peculiar. Captain Hunter says of it : 'I could ti'ace
                                                                                                                                  ON THE ISLAND OF SOCOTKA.  493

no afl5nity to any of tlic languages of the neighbouring coasts. Ifc sounds a

little like Kis Swahili, but not so soft. It is not Mahri, for the Sultan said

it in no way resembled it. The sound is not so guttural as Arabic, and

seems to require less effort in enunciation.' Somalis do not understand it.
Wellsted says the people of the opposite Arabian coast understand it, but

that is not the case. Perhaps Portuguese may have had something to do
Wewith it.

Captain Hunter, who has considerable knowledge of the tribes in that

region, is at present occupied with an investigation into its peculiarities.

But I liave not heard as yet the result of his studies.

     The fact that the Wahabbees visited the island accounts probably for
the absence of the many churches, or traces of them, said to exist in

ancient times on the island. Wellsted observed some ruins, believed to be of

a church. There are, however, still evident the ruined forts of the Portu-

guese. The largest of these is at Feraigey. No written records have been

found                               possibly such would disappear along with the churches.                                                                   Wellsted
                                 ;

speaks of inscriptions on the rocks being visible. None of these were
seen by us. But on the Kadhab plain there occurs a broad pavement of

limestone, 50 yards long by 25 to 30 yards broad, whereon numerous

hieroglyphics are cut. The figures are not in line, and do not give the
idea of any continuous sentence, and they lie at all angles to one another
and varying distances. Some resemble foot- imprints, others distinctly

represent a camel, others are like St. Andrew's cross, others are of
most irregular form.

member of the Section, learned in such matters, will aid in deciphering

the copies I brought of them I shall be indebted to him.

     The government of the island is in the hands of the Sultan of
Keshin and Socotra. At present two brothers are joint Sultans, and one

lives at Keshin, the other resides in Socotra. They are nephews of the
one who, in 1834, refused to sell the island to the British. The Sultan

has complete sway in Socotra. He has a residence on Gharriah plain, at

the base of the Haggler hills, and has also a palace in Tamarida, where he

dispenses justice. Under him each of the large villages has its sheikh or
head, and the island is divided into four sections, each of which is in
charge of a ranger. The Sultan alone has power to inflict punishment.

In each section the land is let out to the various tribes of Bedouins, both
for pasture and for the collection of gum, payment therefor being 'made
in ghi. The Sultan only reserves one portion of land for the collection of

dragon's-blood for himself.

The trade of the island at present is small, ghi being the chief

mexport. It is carried on by buggalows from the Arabian coast. ' These

arrive the first months of the year with coffee, rice, and other articles,

-which they exchange for ghi, aloes, orchella weed, &c., which they
take to Zanzibar, and, on their return, they bring coco-nut, bombe, and

American piece-goods. They dispose of as many of these as possible,

and take outward ghi, aloes, dragon's-blood, blankets, &c., and return to
Arabia. Pearl-fishers from the Persian Gulf at times visit the island
and dispose of their pearls. The Sultan takes tithe of all exports.

From ghi his revenue is about 500^, aloes bring him 250^, edah gives

80^, and other sources bring it up to 1,000^ a year, which, with his

stipend of 360;^ from the British, makes him a comparatively rich man

in this region.'

Such, then, is a brief survey of Socotra as it is at the present day.
494 EEPORT-- 1881.

Many details of interest cannot be included in such a resume as this, but

a full account will shortly appear.

     It may now be asked, What are the prospects of the island ? Is it
possible in the future to make anything of it ?

      There is no doubt but that large tracts of country on the island might,
 with little difficulty, be brought into a state of cultivation. The hills

might be terraced and, by irrigation, water could be taken to spots now
dry and parched. The soil is rich, and would support a large crop of

cereals, fruits, and vegetables, and with increased pasture the cattle and
sheep would multiply enormously. Socotra might thus become a source
of supply for the adjacent continents and for passing ships. In addition
the aloe-culture might easily be undertaken, and this, with dragon's-
blood, boxwood, and orchella weed, would make important articles of
commerce. The want of a safe harbour must militate against the commerce

of the island, but it is pleasing to be able to say that Luke Thomas & Co.,

of London and Aden, have fitted out a small steamer, the Operculum,
which makes her first trip at the end of this month, with the special aim
of developing a trade between Socotra and the Arabian and African
coasts. One can but wish that it may be the pioneer of a regular trade
which will bring the island into contact with civilisation. If dreams of a

commercial future for Socotra be considei-ed too sanguine for realisation,
it is possible to look to the natural history treasures of the island for
valuable contributions to the history of life. After all that has been

done we have only a slight knowledge of them. Moreover there is great
need for a proper map of the island. The map of Haines and Wellsted (the
Admiralty chart) is the only available one, and that is so incomplete and

inaccurate regarding the interior, as to be practically useless. Other
work during our expedition allowed of no more than mere compass-
bearings being taken of the various hills and prominent points, but our

data are not sufficient to enable us to make any great change in the map,

so that a proper topographical survey is a first necessity.

     It was at this Association that Dr. Sclater first brought forward his
proposal for an exploration of the island, and it was by funds supplied by
this Association that the expedition was at first organised. The results

achieved are in great part before the Association, for whom it is to

decide whether or no the end has justified the means. If this has been the
case, and the results are deemed satisfactory, I would only reiterate that

what has been done is but a fragment. Much remains to be done in this

region, not only in Socotra itself, but also on the adjacent coasts of
Arabia and Africa. Funds only are wantiug for the prosecution of the
exploration. In conclusion, I will only express the hope that one
outcome of this most successful meeting will be the carrying out of the

further scientific exploration of these regions.

devoted himself, in that lucid and clear address with which he favoured

us, to the consideration of certain scientific matters connected with en-

gineering, and to the foreshadowing of the directions in which he believes

it possible that further improvements may be sought for. But I feel it is

desirable that some one should give to this Section a record, even although

it must be but a brief and an imperfect one, of certain of the impi-ove-

meuts that have been made, and of some of the progi-ess that has taken

place, during the last fifty years, in the practical application of mechanical

science, with which science and its applications our Section is par-

ticularly connected. I regret to say that, in common with most of the

--gentlemen who sat on this platform yesterday who I think were,
--without exception, past Presidents of the Section I am old enouo-h to

give this record from personal experience. Fifty years ago I had not

the honour of being a member, nor should I, it is true, have been eligible

for membership of the Association; for I was at that time vigorously
making models of steam-engines, to the great annoyance of the house-

hold in which I lived, and was looking forward to the day when I should

be old enough to be apprenticed to an engineer.

Without further preface, I will briefly allude to some of the prin-

cipal developments of a few of the branches cf engineering. I am well

aware that many branches must necessarily be left unnoticed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          but I trust
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

that the omissions I may make will be remedied by those present who
may speak upon the subject after me.

     I will begin by alluding to the Steam Engine employed for manufac-

turing furposes. In 1831 the steam-engine for these purposes was
commonly the condensing beam-engine, and was sujiplied with steam
from boilers known, from their shape, as waggon-boilers. This shape

appears to have been chosen rather for the convenience of the sweeps,

who periodically went through the flues to remove the soot consequent

on the imperfect combustion, than for the purpose of withstanding the

internal pressure of steam. The necessary consequence was, that the
manufacturing engines of those days were compelled to work with steam

of from only 3|- lbs. to 5 lbs. per square inch of pressure above atmo-
sphere. The piston-speed rarely exceeded 2£0 feet per minute, and as
a result of the feeble pressure and of the low rate of speed, very large

cylinders indeed were needed relatively to the power obtained. The
consumption of fuel was heavy, being commonly from 7 lbs to 10 lbs.
per gross indicated horse-power per hour. The governing of the
engine was done by pendulum-governors, revolving slowly, and not

calculated to exert any greater efi'ort than that of raising the balls at
the end of the pendulum-arms, thus being, as will readily be seen,
very inefficient regulators. The connection of the parts of the engine
between themselves was derived from the foundation upon which the
engine wa;S supported. Incident to the low piston-speed was slowness
of revolution, rendering necessary heavy fly-wheels to obtain even an
approach to practical uniformity of rotation, and frequently rendering

necessary also heavy trains of toothed gearing to bring up the speed
from that of the revolution of the engine to that of the machinery it
was intended to drive.

     In 1881 the boilers are almost invariably cylindrical, and are very com-

that tlie danger which at one time existed of the collapse of these

fire-flues has been entirely removed, by his application of circum-

ferential bands. Now-a-days there are, as we know, modifications of Sir

William Fairbairn's bands ; but by means of his bands, or by modifica-

tions thereof, all internally flued boilers are so strengthened that the

risk of a collapse of the flue is at an end. Boilers of this kind are well

calculated to furnish, and commonly do furnish, steam of from 40 lbs. to

80  lbs.  pressure                                 above  atmosphere                                                       the piston-speed  is  now  very gene-

rally 400 feet or more, so that, notwithstanding that there is usually a

liberal expansion, the mean pressure upon the piston is greater, and

this, coupled with the increased piston-speed, enables much more power

to be obtained from a given size of cylinder than was formerly ob-

tainable. The revolutions of the engine now are as many as from 60 to

200 per minute, and thus, with far lighter fly-wheels, uniformity of rota-

tion is much more nearly attained. Moreover, engines are now self-con-

tained, and no longer depend upon the foundation for the connection of

their parts. In many cases the condensing is effected either by surface

condensers, or, where there is not an ample supply of water, the con-

densation is in a few instances effected by the evaporative condensei*

a condenser which, I am sorry to say, is not generally known, and is

therefore but seldom used, although between thirty and forty years

have elapsed since its first introduction. Notwithstanding the length

of time during which the evaporative condenser has been known to

some engineers, it is a common thing to hear persons say, when you ask

them if they are using a condensing engine, ' I cannot use it, I have

--not water enough ' a very sufficient answer, indeed, if an injection

condenser or an ordinary surface condenser constituted the sole means

by which a vacuous condition might be obtained, but a very insufficient

answer having regard to the existence of the evaporative condenser, as

by its means whenever there is water enough for the feed of a non-

condensing engine, there is enough to condense the exhaust steam,

and to produce a good vacuum. The evaporative condenser simply

consists of a sei'ies of pipes, in which is the steam to be condensed,

and over which the water is allowed to fall in a continuous rain. By this

arrangement there is evaporated, from the outside of the condenser, a

weight of water, which goes away in a cloud of vapour and is nearly

equal to the weight of steam which is condensed, and is returned as feed

water into the boiler. The same water is pumped up and used outside the

condenser over and over again, needing no more to supply the waste than

would be needed as feed water, and as the condenser acts by evaporation

its effect is practically as good whether the external water be warm or cold.

Although this condenser has, as I have said, been in use for thirty or

forty years, there are still to be seen engines, working without condensa-

tion at all, or with waterworks water, purchased at a great cost, and to

the detriment of other consumers who want it for ordinary domestic

purposes                                           or large condensing ponds are used in which the injection

water is stored, to be worked over and over again, and frequently

(especially towards the end of the week) in so tepid a state as to be unfit

for its purpose. The governing is now done by means of quick-running

governors, which have power enough in them to raise, not merely the

pendulum-balls, which are small, but a very heavy weight, and in

this way the governor is extremely effective. I propose to say no more

used for manufactiTring purposes, but rather to turn at once to those

employed for other objects.

   --Steam Navigation. In 1831 there were a considerable number of

paddle-steamers running on some of the rivers in England and across

the Channel to the Continent. But there were no ocean steamers, properly

so called, and there were no steamers used for warlike purposes. As in

the case of the waggon-boilers, the boilers of the paddle-steamers of 1831

vrere most unsuited for resisting pressure. They were mere tanks, and

as tanks the downward strain from the mere weight of water was as

great on the bottom plates, even in the absence of any steam-pressure

within the boiler at all, as, when the steam was up, was the upward

strain on the top plates. Under these circumstances, again, from 3^^ lbs.

to 5 lbs. on the square inch was all the pressure the boilers were competent

to bear, and this feeble pressure, coupled with the slow speed at which

the engines ran, caused them to develoji but a small amount of horse-power

in relation to their size. Moreover, as in the land engine, the connec-

tion between the parts of the marine engine was such as to be incompetent

to stand the strain that would come upon it if a higher pressure, with a

considerable expansion, were used, and thus the consumption of coal

was very heavy                                                                            and we  know,  that having regard  to the  then  con-
                                                                                       ;

sumption, it was said, on high authority, it would be impossible for

a steam-boat to cross the j^.tlantic, as it could not carry fuel enough to

last out the voyage ; and it was not till 1838 that the Siritis and the
Gi-eat Western did make the passage. One boat, it is true, had crossed

before, but it was not till 1838 that passenger traffic was really com-

menced. In 1831, owing to the condensation being effected by injection,

the marine boiler was supplied with salt Water, the hulls were invariably

of wood, and the speed was, probably, from eight to nine knots an hour.

In 1881 the vessels are as invariably either of iron or of steel, and I

believe it will not be very long before the iron disappears, giving place

entirely to the last- mentioned metal. With respect to the term ' steel ' I am

ready to agree that it is impossible to say where, chemically speaking, iron

ends and steel begins. But (leaving out malleable cast-iron) I apply this
term steel to any malleable ductile metal of which iron forms the principal

element, and which has been in fusion, and I do so in contradistinction to

the metal which may be .similar chemically but which has been prepared

by the puddling process. Applying the term steel in that sense, 1 believe,

as I have said, it will not be very long before plate iron, produced by the
puddling process, will cease to be used for the purpose of building vessels.

With respect to marine engines these are now supplied with steam from

multiple-tubed boilers which are commonly cylindrical. They are of
enormous strength and made with every possible care, and carry from 80

to 100 lbs. pressure on the square inch. It has been found, on the
whole, more convenient to expand the steam in two or more cylinders

rather than in one. I quite agree that, as a mere matter of engineering

science, there is no reason why the expansion should not take place in a
single cylinder, unless it be that you cool down a single cylinder to an

extent which cannot be overcome by jacketing, and which, therefore,

destroys a portion of the steam on its entrance into the cylinder. As

regards the propeller, as we know, except in certain cases, the paddle-

wheel has practically disappeared, and we have the screw-propeller

emjjloyed, either singly, or in pairs. This substitution of the screw-

propeller for the paddle enables the engines to work at a much

greater number of revolutions per minute, and thus a piston-speed

of some 600 to 800 feet per minute is attained ; and this, coupled

with the fairly high mean pressure which prevails, enables a large

power to be got from a comparatively small-sized engine. Speeds of

15 knots an hour are now iu many cases maintained by steam-vessels
throughout their voyages, and on trial trips are not uncommonly ex-

Weceeded. The steam-vessel is now the accepted vessel of war.

have them in an ai-moured state and in an unarmoured state, but when

unarmoured rendered so formidable by the power which their speed

gives them of choosing their distance, as to make them, when fur-

nished with powerful guns, dangerous opponents even to the best

Wearmoured vessels.  have also now marine engines governed by

governors of such extreme sensitiveness as to give them the semblance

of being endowed with the spirit of prophecy, as they appear rather to be

regulating the engine for that which is about to take place than for that

which is taking place. This may sound a somewhat extravagant state-

ment, but it is so nearly the truth that I have hardly gone outside of it,

in using the words I have employed. For a marine governor to be of

any use it must not wait till the stern of the vessel is out of the water,

before it acts to check the engine and reduce the speed ; nothing but the

most sensitive and indeed anticipatory action of the governor can effi-

ciently control marine propulsion. Instances are on record of vessels

having engines without marine governors, being detained by stress of

weather at the mouth of the Thames, while vessels having such

governors, of good design, have gone to Newcastle, have come back,

and have found the other vessels still waiting for more favourable

weather. With respect to condensation in marine engines it is almost

invariably effected by surface-condensers, and thus it is that the boilers,

instead of being fed with salt water as they used to be, involving

continuous blowing-off and frequently the salting-up of the boiler,

are now fed with distilled water. It should be noticed, however,

that in some instances, owing to the absence of a thin protecting scale

upon the tubes and plates, very considerable corrosion has taken place,

especially where distilled water, derived from condensers having un-tinucd

brass tubes, has been used for the feed, and where the water has carried

into the boiler fat-acids arising from the decomposition of the grease

used in the engine ; means are now employed by which these effects are

counteracted.

myI wish before quitting this section of  subject, to call your

attention to two very interesting but very differing kinds of marine

engines. One is the high-speed torpedo-vessel or steam launch of which

Messrs. Thornycroft have furnished so many examples. In these, owing

to the rate at which the piston runs, to the initial pressure (120 lbs.), and

to very great skill in the design, Messrs. Thornycroft have succeeded in

obtaining a gross indicated horse-power for as small a weight as half a

cwt., including the boiler, the water in the boiler, the engine, the pro-

peller shaft, and the propeller itself. To obtain the needed steam from

the small and light boiler, recourse has to be made to a fan-blast driving
air into a closed stoke-hold. From the use of a blast in this way two

excellent things happen : one is, as already stated, that from a small

boiler a very large amount of steam is produced, and the other that the
artificial blast, wlien thus applied, is unaccompanied by the dangers which

arise when, under ordinary circumstances, the blast is applied only to
                                                                                                                                 --;

the ash-pit itself. The other marine engine to which I wish to call

your attention, is one that has been made with a view to great economy.

The principles followed in its construction are among those suggested

by the President (Sir W. G. Armstrong) in his address. He you

-- --will remember pointed out that the direction in which economy in the
steam-engine was to be looked for was in that of increasing the initial

pressure                                         although, at the same time, he said, there were drawbacks, in the
                                              ;

shape of greater loss by radiation, and by the higher temperature at which

the products of combustion would escape. "We must admit the fact of the

latter source of loss when using a very high pressure of steam, it beino-

inevitable that the temperature of the products of combustion escaping

from a boiler under these conditions must be higher than those which

need be allowed to escape when a lower pressure of steam is employed

although I regret to say that in practice in marine boilers, working at com-

paratively low pressures, the products are ordinarily suffered to pass into

the funnel, at above the temperature of melting lead.' But with respect

--to the loss by radiation in the particular engine I am about to mention

that of Perkins there is not so much loss as that which prevails in the

ordinary marine boiler, because the Perkins boiler is completely enclosed,

with the result that while there is within the case a boiler containino-

steam of 400 lbs. on the square inch, and the fire to generate that steanT,

the hand may be applied to the casing itself, which contains the whole of

the boiler, without receiving any unpleasant sensation of warmth. By

Mr. Perkins' arrangement, using steam of 400 lbs. in the boiler, it was

found, as the result of very severe trials conducted by Mr. Eich, of

--Messrs. Easton and Anderson's firm, and myself-- trials which lasted for

twelve hours that the total consumption of fuel, including that for
getting up steam from cold water, was just under 1-8 (actually 179) '

lbs. per gross indicated horse-power per hour. That consumption was

ascertained in a manner which it is desirable should always be employed

in steam-boat trials. It was not arrived at by using as a divisor the

horse-power of the most favourable diagram obtained during the day,

but it was got from diagrams taken every half-hour during the regular

work                        then, when the       pressure  began  to  die down,                         from  coal  being        no
                         ;

longer put upon the fire, diagrams taken every quarter of an hour ;'' and

then,                       towards the last,    every  five  minutes                                   and the total number of  foot-
                                                                                                     ;

pounds were calculated from these diagrams, and were used to obtain the

gross indicated horse-power.

     Furthei-, so far as could be ascertained by the process of commencino-
a trial with a known fire, and closing that trial, at the end of six hours',
with the fire as nearly as possible in the same condition, the consumption
was 1-66 lbs. of_ coal per gross indicated horse-power per hour, so that,
without taking into account the coal consumed in raising steam from
cold water, the engine worked for If lbs. of coal per horse per hour. I
think it well to give these details because, undoubtedly, this is an ex-

tremely economical result.

     Our President alluded to the employment of ether as a means of
utilising the heat which ordinarily escapes uselessly into the condenser,

     » It should have been noticed, that although the products of combustion must
escape from the boiler at a greater temperature where a high pressure of steam is
employed than they need escape at where a lower pressure is used, it does not follow
that loss should accrue on this account, as the excess can, by means of a heater, be
taken up by the feed water : a plan Mr. Perkins is employing in practice.

and he gave some account of that which was done by M. Du Tremblay

in this direction. It so happened I had occasion to investigate the

matter at the time of Da Tremblay's experiments. Very little was

effected here in England, one difficulty being the excise interference
with the manufacture of ether. Chloroform was used here, and it was
also suggested to employ bi-sulphide of carbon. In France, however, a
great deal was done. Four large vessels were fitted with the ether-
engine, and I went over to Marseilles to see them at work. I took
diagrams from them, and found that by this system the exhaust steam
from the steam-cylinder, which was condensed by the application of
ether to the surface of the steam-condenser (producing a respectable

vacuum of 22 inches), gave an ether-pressure of some ISlbs. on the
square inch ahove atmosphere, and that very economical results as
regards fuel were obtained. The system was, however, eventually aban-

doned, owing to pi'actical difficulties. It need hardly be said that ether-
vapour is very difficult to deal with, and although ether is light the
vapour is extremely heavy, and if there is any leak in the appai-atus the
vapour goes down into the bilges by gravitation, and being mixed with
air, unless due care is taken to prevent access to the fires, there would
be a constant risk of a violent explosion. In fact, it was necessary to

treat the engine-room in the way in which a fiery colliery would be
treated ; the light, for instance, was by lamps external to the engine-room,
and shining through thick plate glass, while the hand-lamps were
Davy's. The Ether Engine was a bold experiment in applied science, and

one that entitles Du Tremblay's name to be preserved and to be mentioned

as it was by our President. There was another kind of marine engine
that I think should not be passed over without notice. I allude to
Howard's Quicksilver Engine. The experiments with this engine were
persevered in for some considerable time, and it was actually used for

 practical purposes in propelling a passenger vessel called the Vesta,

running from London to Ramsgate. In that engine the boiler had
 a double bottom containing an amalgam of quicksilver and lead. This
 amalgam served as a reservoir of heat, which it took up from the fire
 below the double bottom, and gave forth at intervals to the water
 above it. There was no water in the boiler, in the ordinary sense of
 the term, but when steam was wanted to start the engine, a small
 quantity of water was injected by means of a hand pump, and after the
 engine was started there was pumped by it into the boiler, at each half-
 revolution, as much water as would produce the steam needed. This
 water was dispersed on the top surface of the reservoir in which the
iimalgam was confined, and was entirely flashed into steam, the object of
 the engineer in charge being to send in only so much as would just
·generate the steam, without leaving any water in the boiler. The
-engines of the Vesta were made by Mr. Penn for Mr. Howard, of the
 King and Queen Ironworks, Rotherhithe. Mr. Howard was, I fear, a
considerable loser by his meritorious efforts to improve the steam-engine.

      The President : What sort of results did they get in point of economy ?

       Sir Frederich Bramwell : I don't know, but I believe they got
 moderately good results. There was used with this engine an almost un-

 known mode of obtaining fresh water for the boiler. Fresh water, it will
 be seen, was a necessity in this mode of evaporation, as the presence of
 salt or anj"- other impurity when the whole of the water was flashed into
 steam, must have caused a deposit at the top of the amalgam chamber

at each operation. Fresh water, therefore, was needed, and the problem
then arose how to get it ; and that problem was solved, not by the use of

sm^'ace-condensation, but by the employment of re-injectiou ; that is to say,
an ordinary injection-condenser being used, the water delivered from the

hot well  was  passed  into  pipes  external  to  the  vessel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     after  traversing

them it came back into the injection-tank sufhciently cooled to be used

again. The boilers were worked by coke fires urged by a fan-blast in

their ashpits, but I am not aware that this mode of firing was a needful

part of the system.

1831 the Manchester and Liverpool Railway had been opened only

about a year. The Stockton and Darlington coal-line, it is true, had

carried passengers by steam-power as early as 1825                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but I think we  may

look upon the Manchester and Liverpool as being the beginning of the

passenger and mercantile railway system of the present day. In 1831

the locomotives weighed from eight to ten tons, and the speed was

about twenty miles per hour, with a pressure of steam in the boiler of

from 40 to 50 lbs. The rails were light, they were jointed in the chairs,

which wei'e generally carried on stone blocks, thus affording most excel-

lent anvils for the battering to pieces of the ends of the rails, that is to

say, for the destruction of the very parts where they were most vulner-

able. The engines were not competent to draw heavy trains, and it was
a common practice to have at the foot of an incline a shed containing a

' bank engine,' which ran out after the trains as they passed, and pushed

them up to the top of the hill. Injectors were then unknown, and donkey-

pumps Avere unknown, and therefore, when it was necessary to fill up

the boiler, if it had not been properly pumped up before the locomotive

came to rest, then the locomotive had to run about the Hne in order to work

its feed-pumps. To get over this difficulty, it was occasionally the prac-

tice to insert into a line of rails, in a siding, a pair of wheels, with their

tops level with those of the rails, so that th'e engine wheels could run upon

their rims. Then, the locomotive being fixed, to prevent it from moving

off the pair of wheels endways, it was put into revolution, its driving wheels

bearing, as already stated, upon the rims of the pair of wheels in the rails,
and thus the engine worked its feed-pumps, without interfering (by its

needless running up and down the line) with the traffic. It should have

been stated that at this time there was no link motion, no practical

expansion of the steam, and that even the reversal of the engine had to

be effected by working the slides by hand gear, in the manner in use in.

marine engines. When the British Association originated, although the

Manchester and Liverpool Railway had been opened for a year, there is

no doubt that the 300 members who then came to this city, found their
way here by the slow process of the stage coach, the loss of which we so
much deplore in the summer and in fine weather, but the obligatory use

of which we should so much regret in the miserable weather now pre-

vailing in these islands. In 1881 we know that railways are everywhere.

Steel rails, double the weight of the original iron ones, are used. Wooden

sleepers have replaced the stone blocks, and they in their turn Avill pro-

bably give way to sleepers of steel. The joints are now made by means

of fishplates, and the most vulnerable part of the rail, the end, is no

longer laid on an anvil for the purpose of being smashed to pieces, bub

the ends of the rails are now almost always over a void, and thereby are

not more affected by wear than is any other part of the rail. The speed
502 EEPORT-- 1881.

is now from 50 to 60 miles an hour for passenger trains, while slow-

speed goods engines, weighing 45 tons, draw behind them coal trains

of 800 tons. The injector is commonly employed, and by its aid a careful

driver of the engine of a stopping train can almost succeed in doing

the whole of the feeding at the time when his engine is at rest at the

stations, and when, therefore, no demand is being made on the boiler.

The link motion is in common use, to which, no doubt, is owing the very

considerable economy with which the locomotive engine now works. As

regards the question of safety, it is a fact, that, notwithstanding the

increased speed, railway accidents ai'c fewer in proportion than they were

at the slow speed. Indeed, the number of deaths is so small that, if

the whole population of London were to take a railway journey, there

would be but one death arising out of it. Four millions of journeys for

one death of a passenger from causes beyond his own control, is, I

believe, a state of security which rarely prevails elsewhere than in a

railway train. As an instance, the street accidents in London alone

cause between 200 and 300 deaths per annum. This safety in railway-

travelling is, no doubt, largely due to the block system, rendered possible

by the electric telegraph ; and also to the efficient interlocking of points

and signals, which makes it impossible now for a signalman to give an
unsafe signal. He may give an incorrect one, in the sense of inviting the

wi'ong train to come in, but although incorrect in this sense, it would still

be safe for that train to obey it. If he can give a signal that signal

never invites to danger. Before he can give it every one of the signals

which ought to be at danger must be at danger, and every point must have

been previously set so as to make the road right. Then again, we have the

facing-point-lock, which is a great source of safety. Further, we have

continuous brakes of various kinds, competent in practice to absorb three

--miles of speed in every second of time that is to say, if a train were

going 60 miles an hour it can be pulled up in 20 seconds, or if at the

rate of 30 miles in 10 seconds. With a train running at 50 miles an

hour it can be pulled up in from 15 to 20 seconds, and in a distance of

from 180 to 2-10 yards. Moreover, in the event of the train separating

into two or more sections, the brakes are automatically applied to all the

sections, thereby bringing them to rest in a short time. Another cause of

safety is undoubtedly the use of weldless tyres. I was fortunate enough

to attend the British Association Meeting many years ago at Birmingham,

and I then read a paper upon weldless tyres, in which I ventured to

prophesy that in ten years' time there would not be a welded tyre made.

That is one of the few prophecies that, being made before the event,

have been fulfilled. I may perhaps be permitted to mention that at the

Gsame time I laid before Section plans and suggestions for the makinp^

of the cylindrical parts of boilers also without seam or even welding.

This is rarely done at the present time, but I am sure that in twenty

years' time such a thing as a longitudinal seam of rivets in a boiler will

be unknown. There is no reason why the successive rings of boiler-

shells should not be made weldless, as tyres are now made weldless.

The next subject I intend to deal with is that of Motors. In 1831 we had

the steam-engine, the water-wheel, the windmill, horse power, manual

power, and Stirling's hot-air engines. Gas engines, indeed, were proposed in

We1824, but were not brought to the really practical stage.                          had then tide-

mills                       indeed  we  have  had  them  until  quite  lately,  and  it may be  that
                         ;

some still exist. They were sources of economy iu our fuel, and their
      OxX THE DEVELOPMENTS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEEEING.                                                     503

abandonment is to me a matter of regret. I remember tide-mills on

the coast between Brighton and Newhaven ; another between Greenwich

and Woolwich, another at Northfleet, and others in various places.

Indeed such mills were used pretty extensively. They were generally

erected at the mouth of a stream, and in that way the river-bed made

the reservoir, and even when they were erected in other situations those

--were of a kind suitable for the purpose that is, low-lying lands were

selected and were embanked to form reservoirs. In 1881 wind-mills and

water-wheels are much the same as they were in 1831 ; but turbines are

greatly improved, and by means of the turbine we are enabled to make

available the pressure derived from heads of water which formerly could

not be used at all, or if used they involved the erection of enormous

water-wheels, such as those at Glasgow and in the Isle of Man, wheels

of some 80 feet in diameter. But now by means of a small turbine an

excellent effect is produced from high heads of water. The same effect

is obtained from the water-engines which our President has employed

with such great success. In addition to these motors we have the gas-

engine, which within the last few years only has become a really nseful

working and economical machine. With respect to horse-power motors

we have not only the old horse-machines, but we have a new application

(as it seems to me) of the work of the horse as a motor. I allude to

those cases where the horse, drawing a reaping or thrashing machine,

not only pulls it forward as he might pull a cart, but causes its machinery

to revolve so as to perform the desired kind of work. This species of

horse-engine, though known, was but little used in 1831. With respect

to hot-air engines there have been many attempts to improve them, and

some  hot-air  engines  are working,  and  with  considerable  success                                    but
                                                                                                       ;

the amount of power they develop in relation to their size is small, and

I am inclined to doubt whether it can be much increased.

I now come to the subject of the Transmission of Power. I do not

mean transmission in the ordinary sense by means of shafting, gearing, or

belting, but I mean transmission over long distances. In 1831 we had

--for this purpose fiat rods, as they were called rods transmitting power

from pumping engines for a considerable distance to the pits where the

pumps were placed, and we had also the pneumatic, the exhaustion

system, the invention of John Hague, a Torkshireman, my old master, to

whom I was apprenticed, which mode of transmission was then used to

a very considerable extent. The recollection of it, I find, however, has

nearly died out, and I am glad to have this opportunity of reviving it.

But in 1881 we have for the transmission of power, first of all quick-

moving ropes, and let me refer you to an excellent instance of this system

at Schjiffhausen. Anyone who has in recent years gone a mile or two above

the falls at Schafifhansen must have seen there, in a house on the bank of

the Rhine, opposite to that on which the town is situated, large turbines

driven by the river, which is slightly dammed for the purpose. These

work quick-going ropes carried on pulleys, erected at intervals along the

river-bank for the whole length of the town, and power is delivered from

them to shafting below the streets, and from it into any house where

it is required for manufacturing purposes. Then we have the compressed-

air transmission of power, a mode which is very largely used for under-

ground engines, and for the working of rock-drills in mines and tunnels.

We have also compressed air in a portable form, and it is now emploved

with great success in driving tramcars. I had occasion last January to
                                                                                                    ;

--504 REPORT 1881.

visit Nantes, where for eighteen months tramcars had been driven by

compressed air, carried on the cars themselves, coupled with an extremely

ingenious arrangement for overcoming the difEculties commonly attendant

on the use of compressed-air engines. This consists in the provision of

a cylindrical vessel half filled with hot water and half with steam at a

jDressure  of  80 lbs.  on  the  square  inch                        the  compressed  air  on  its  way
                                                                  ;

from the reservoir to the engine passes through the water and steam,

becoming thereby heated and moistened, and thus all the danger of

forming ice in the cylinders is prevented and the pistons and slides are

susceptible of good lubrication. These cars, which start every ten minutes

from each end, make a journey of of miles, and have proved to be a
commercial and an engineering success. I believe, moreovei-, that the

system is capable of very considerable improvement. Then there is,

although not much used, the transmitting of power by means of long

steam pipes. There is also the transmission hydraulically. This may be

carried out in an intermittent manner, so as to replace the reciprocating

flat rods of old days. That is to say, if two pipes containing water are

laid down, and if the pressure in those pipes at the one end be alternated,

there will be produced an alternating and a reciprocative effect at the

other end, which may be employed to give motion to pumps or other

machinery. There is also that thoroughly well-known mode of trans-

mission hydraulically for which the engineering woi4d owes so much to

Weour President.        have, by Sir William Armstrong's system, coupled

with his accumulator, the means of transmitting hydraulically the power

of a central motor to any place requiring it, and by means of the

principal accumulator, or if need be by that aided by local accumulators,

a comparatively small engine is enabled to meet very heavy demands

made upon it for a short time. I think I am right in saying that at

the ordinary pressure which Sir William Armstrong uses in practice,

VIZ., 700 lbs. to the square inch, one foot per second of motion along an

inch pipe would deliver at the rate to produce one horse-power. There-

fore a 10-inch pipe with the water travelling at no greater pace than 3

feet in a second would deliver 300 horse-power. This 300 horse-power

would, no doubt, be somewhat reduced by the loss in the hydraulic engine,
which would utilise the water, but the total energy received would be

equivalent to producing 300 horse-power. Such a transmission would

be effected with an exceedingly small loss in friction in transit; I believe I

am right in saying, that a 10-inch pipe a mile long would not involve
much more than about 14 lbs. or 15 lbs. differential pressure to propel the

water through it at a rate of 3 feet in a second. If that be so, then with

700 lbs. to the inch, the loss under such circumstances would be only 2

per cent, in transmission. There is no doubt that this transmission of
power hydraulically has been of the greatest possible use. It has

enabled work to be done which could not be done before. Enormous

weights are raised with facility wherever required, as, by the aid of

power hydraulically transmitted, it is perfectly easy for one man to
manage the heaviest crane. Moreover, as I have said in other places,

this system, which we owe to Sir William Armstrong, has gone far to
elevate the human race, and it has done so in this manner. So long as

it is competent for a man to earn a living by a mere unintelligent exercise

of his mutcles he is very likely so to do. You may see in the old London

Docks the crane-heads covered by structures that look Hke paddle-boxes

if you go up to them you will find, I am glad to say, there is nothing now
ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.  505

to occupy them ; but at the date when the British Association first met,
these j^ad die -boxes covered large tread -wheels, in which the men trod so
as to raise a weight. Now, although I know that, in fact, there is
nothing more objectionable in a man turning a wheel by treading inside
of it, than there is if he turn it round by a winch-handle, yet somehow it
strikes one more as being merely the work of an animal, a turnspit or a

squirrel, or indeed as being the task imposed on the criminal. Never-

theless, in this way there were a lai'ge number of persons getting their

living by the mere exercise of their muscles, but, as might be expected,
a very poor living, derived as it was from unintelligent labour. That
work, since the introduction of Sir William's hydraulic system, is no

longer possible, and is not so for the powerful reason that it 'does not

pay. Those persons, therefore, who would formerly have been thus
occupied are compelled to elevate themselves, and to become competent
to earn their living in a manner which is more worthy of an intelligent
human being. It is on these grounds that I say we owe very much the

--elevation of the working classes especially of the class below the artizan
--to this excellent invention of our distinguished President.

     In addition to the modes of transmission I have already mentioned, there
is the Transmission of Power hy means of Gas. I think that there is a very

large future indeed for gas-engines. I do not know whether this may
be the place wherein to state it, but I believe the way in which we shall
utilise our fuel hereafter will, in all probability, not be by the way of

the steam-engine. Sir William Armstrong alluded to this probability in

-- --his address, and I entirely agree if he will allow me to say so that such

a change in the production of power from fuel appears to be impending,

if not in the immediate future, at all events in a time not very far remote :

and however much the Mechanical Section of the British Association may

to-day contemplate with regret even the mere distant prospect of the

steam-engine becoming a thing of the past, I very much doubt whether
those who meet here fifty years hence will then speak of that motor
except in the character of a curiosity to be found in a museum.

     With respect to the transmission of power electrically I won't venture

to touch upon that ; but will content myself by reminding you that,
while Sir William Armstrong did refer to the fact that there were com-
paratively small streams which could be utilised, he did not inform you of

what he himself had done in this direction. Let me now say that Sir

William Armstrong has thus utilised a fall of water situated about a
mile from his house, to work a turbine, which drives a dynamo-machine

generating electricity for the illumination of the house. When I was last

at Crag Side that illumination was being effected by the arc light, but
since then, he has replaced the arc light by the incandescent lamp (a

form of electi'Ical lighting far more applicable than the arc light to

domestic purposes), and has done this with the greatest possible success.

Thus in Sir William Armstrong's own case a small stream is made to

afford light in a dwelling a mile away. Certainly' nothing could have
seemed more improbable fifty years ago than that the light of a house
should be derived from a fall of water without the employment of any

kind or description of combustible matter.
     The next subject upon which I propose to touch is that of the

Manufacture of Iron and Steel. In 1831, Neilson's hot blast specification

had been published for 2^ years only. The Butterley Company had tried
the hot blast for the first time in the November preceding the meeting
                                                                           ;

506 REPORT-- 1881.

of tlie British Association ; the heating of the blast was coming veiy
slowly into use, and the temperature attained when heatiug was

employed was only some 600 degrees. The ordinary blast furnace of

those days was 35 to 40 feet high, and about 12 feet diameter at the

boshes, and turned out about 60 tons a week. It used about 2^ tons of

coal per ton of iron, and no attempt was made to utilise the waste gases,

whether escaping in the form of gas or in the form of flame, the country

being illuminated for miles around at night by these fires. The furnaces

were also open at the hearth, and continuous fire poured out along

with the slag. In 1881 blast furnaces are from 90 to 100 feet high and

25 feet in diameter at the boshes ; and they turn out from 500 to 800
tons a week. The tops and also the hearths are closed, and the blast,

thanks to the use of Mr. E. A. Cowper's stoves, is at 1,200 degrees. The

manufacture of iron has also now enlisted in its service the chemist as

well as the engineer, and amongst those who have done much for the

improvement of the blast furnace, to no one is greater praise due than

to Mr. Isaac Lowthian Bell, who has brought the manufacture of iron

to the position of a highly scientific operation. In the production

of wrought iron by the puddling process, and in the subsequent mill

operations, there is no very considerable change except in the magnitude

of the machines employed and in the greater rapidity with which they

now run. In saying this I am not forgetting the various mechanical

puddlers which have been put to work, nor the attempts which have

been made by the use of some of them to make wrought-iron direct

from the ore ; but neither the mechanical puddler nor the direct processes

have yet come into general use, and I desire to be taken as speaking of

that which is the ordinary method pursued at the present in puddled

iron manufacture. In 1831 a few hundredweights was the limit of

weight of a plate, while in 1881 there may readily be obtained for

boiler-making purposes plates of at least four times the weight of those

that were the limit of weight in 1831. I may, perhaps, be allowed to say

that there is an extremely interesting Blue Book of the year 1818, con-

taining the report of a Parliamentary Committee which was appointed to

investigate a boiler explosion, and I recommend any mechanical engineer

who is interested in the history of the subject to read that book. He will

find it there stated that in the North of England there was a species of

engines called locomotives, the boilers of which were made of wrought-

iron beaten, not rolled, because the rolled plate was not considered fit

it was added that if made of beaten iron the boiler would last at least

a year.

    In 1831, thirteen years later, the dimensions of rolled plates were,

no  doubt,  raised                               but  few then would have  supposed it possible there
                                              ;

should be rolled such plates as are now produced for boiler purposes,

and still fewer would have believed that in the year 1881 we should make

for warlike purposes rolled plates 22 inches in thickness and 30 tons in

weight. I have said there is very little alteration in the process of

making wrought iron by puddling, and I do not think there is likely
to be much further, if any, improvement in this process, because I

believe that, with certain exceptions, the manufacture of iron by puddling

is a doomed industry. I ventured to say, in a lecture I delivered at the

Royal Institution three years ago, on ' The Future of Steel,' that I

believed puddled iron, except for the mere hand-wrought forge purposes

of the country blacksmith, and for such-like purposes, would soon
                                                                                  ;

       ON THE DEVELOniENTS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.                        507

become a thing of tlie past. Mr. Harrison, the engineer of the North

Eastern Railway, told me that about eighteen months ago that railway

applied for tenders for rails in any quantities between 2,000 and 10,000

tons,  and  issued  alternative  specifications  for  iron  and for  steel.   They

                                                                             _

received about ten tenders ; certain of those who sent them in did not

care to tender for iron at all, and in some cases where the alternative

price was quoted, that for the iron exceeded that for the steel. I have no

doubt whatever that in a short time it will be practically impossible to

procure iron, made by the puddling process, of dimensions fit for many
of the purposes for which a few years ago it alone was used. With

respect to steel, in 1831 the process in use was that of cementation,
producing blistered steel, which was either piled and welded to make

shear steel, or was broken into small pieces, and melted in pots, and run

into ingots weighing only some 50 lbs. or 60 lbs. each. At that time steel

was dealt in by the pound ; nobody thought of steel in tons. In 1881 we

are all aware that by Sir Henry Bessemer's well-known discovery, carried

out by him with such persistent vigour, cast-iron is by the blowing

process converted into steel ; and that by Dr. Siemens' equally well-

known process, now that, owing to his invention of the regenerative

furnace, it is possible to obtain the necessary high temperature, steel is

made upon the open hearth ; and we are moreover aware that by both of
these processes it is produced in quantities of many tons at a single
operation, with the result that, as instanced in the case of the North
Eastern rails, steel is a cheaper material than the wrought-iron made
by the puddling process. One cannot pass away from the steel manu-

facture without alluding to Sir Joseph Whitworth's process of putting

a pressure on the steel while in a fluid state. By this means the cavities

which are frequently to be found in ingots of a large size, are, -while the

material is still fluid, considerably diminished, and the steel is thereby

rendered much more sound. In conclusion of my observations on the

subject of iron and steel manufacture, I wish to call attention to the

invention of Messrs. Thomas & Gilchrist, by which ores of iron containing

impurities that unfitted them to be used in the manufacture of steel, are

now freed from these impurities, and are thus brought into use for steel-

making purposes.

With respect to Bridges : in the year 1831 bridges of cast-iron existed,

but no attempt had been made to emj)loy wrought-iron in girder bridges,

although Telford and others had employed it in suspension bridges

but in 1881 the introduction of railways and the improvements in iron

manufacture have demanded and have rendered possible the execution

of such bridges as the tubular one sti-etching across the Menai Straits in

spans of 400 feet, and the Saltash over the Tamar, with spans of 435 feet

while the recent great improvements in the manufacture of steel have

rendered possible the construction of the contemplated Forth Bridge,

where there are to be spans of 1,700 feet, or one-third of a mile in

length. Mr. Barlow (one of the engineers of this bridge) has told me

that there will be used upwards of 2,000 more tons in the Forth Bridge

to resist the wind-pressure, than would have been needed if no wind

had had to be taken into account, and if the question of the simple

weight to bo" carried had alone to be considered. With respect to the

foundation of bridges, that ingenious man, Lord Cochrane, patented a

mode of sinking foundations even before the first meeting of the British

--Association viz., as far back, I believe, as 1825 or 1826 ; and the
508 heport-- 1881.

improvements wliicli he then invented are almost universally in use in

bridge-constrnction at the present day. Cylinders sunk by the aid of

compressed air, ' air-locks ' to obtain access to the cylinders, and, in fact,

every means that I know as having been used in the modern sinking of

cylinder foundations, were described by Lord Cochrane (afterwards Earl

of Dandonald) in that specification.

     The next subject I propose to touch upon is that of Machine Tools.

The mention of lathes, drilling machines, and screwing machines brings

me very nearly to the end of the list of the machine tools used by tur-

ners and fitters in 1831, and at that time many of the lathes were

without slide-rests. The boiler-maker had then his punching press

and shearing-machine ; the smith, leaving on one side his forges and the

bellows, had nothing but hand tools, and the limit of these was a huge

hammer with two handles, requiring two men to work it. In anchor

manufacture, it is true, a mechanical drop-hammer, known as a Hercules,

was employed ; while in ironworks the Helve and the Tilt hammer were

in use. For ordinary smith's-work, however, there were, as has been said,

practically no machine tools at all.

     This paucity, or indeed, absence in some trades, as we have seen, of

machine tools, involved the need of very considerable skill on the part of

the workman. It required the smith to be a man not only of great mus-

cular power, but to be possessed of an accurate eye and a correct judg-

ment, in order to produce the forgings which were demanded of him,

and to make the sound work that was needed, especially when that sound-

ness was required in shafts and in other pieces which in those days were

looked upon as of magnitude, as, indeed, they were relatively to the

tools which could be brought to operate upon them. The boiler-maker

in his work had to trust almost entirely to the eye for correctness of

form and for regularity of piinching, while all parts of engines and

machines which could not be dealt with in the lathe, in the drilling, or

in the screwing machine, had to be prepared by the use of the chisel

and the file.

     At the present day the turning and fitting shops are furnished

not only with the slide-lathe, self-acting in both directions, and screw-

cutting, the drilling machine, and the screwing machine, but with

planing machines competent to plane horizontally, vertically, or at an

angle                                 shaping machines, rapidly reciprocating and                                                                                                dealing with almost
                                   ;

any form of work ; nut-shaping machines ; slot-drilling machines, and

slotting machines                                                                                 while the drills  have become                                                  multiple and radial, and
                                                                                               ;

the accuracy of the work is ensured by testing on large surface-plates,

and by the employment of Whitworth internal and external standard

gauges.

     The boiler-maker's tools now comprise the steam, compressed air,

hydraulic, or other mechanical riveter ; rolls for the iDcnding of plates,

while cold, into the needed cylindrical or conical forms ; multiple drills
for the drilling of rivet-holes planing machines to plane the edges of

smaller pieces of work are commonly prepared either in forging machines
or under rapidly-moving hammers, and -when needed in sufficient num-
bers, are made in dies ; and applicable to all the three industries of the
fitting shop, the boiler shop, and the smith's shop, and also to that other
industry carried on in the foundry, are the travelling and swing cranes,
commonly worked by shafting or by quick-moving ropes for the travellers,
and by hydraulic power or by steam-engines for the swing cranes. It
may safely be said that without the aid of these implements it would be
impossible to handle the weights that are met with in machinery of the

present day.

     I now come to one class of machine which, humble and small as it is,
has probably had a greater effect upon industry and ujion domestic life
than almost any other. I mean the Sewing Machine. In 1831 there
was no means of making a seam except by the laborious pi'ocess of the
hand needle. In 1846 Eldred Walker patented a machine for passing

--the basting thread through the gores of umbrellas a machine which was

very ingenious and very simple, but utterly unlike the eye-pointed needle

--sewing machine of the present day, using sometimes two threads the
--second being put in by a shuttle or by another needle and making

stitches at twentyfold the rapidity with which the most expert needle-

woman could woi'k. By means of the sewing-machine not only are all

textile fabrics operated upon, but even the thickest leather is dealt with,

and, as a totir de force, but as a matter of fact, sheet-iron plates them-
selves have been pierced and have been united by a seam no boiler-maker
ever contemplated, the piercing and the seam being produced by a Blake
sewing machine. I believe all in this Section will agree that the use

of the sewing machine has been unattended by loss to those who earn

--their living by the needle in fact, it would not be too much to say that

there has been a positive improvement in their wages.
     The next matter I have to touch upon is that of Agriculhiral

Machinery . In 1831 we had threshing machines and double ploughs,
and even multiple ploughs had been proposed, tried, and abandoned.
Reaping machines had been experimented with and abandoned sowing

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

machines were in use, but not many of them ; clod-crushers and horse-

rakes were also in use, but, as a fact, ploughing was done by horse-
power a single furrow at a time, mowing and reaping were done by
the scythe or the sickle, sheaves were bound by hand, hay was tedded
by hand-rakes, while all materials and produce Avere moved about in carts
and waggons drawn by horses. At the present time we have multiple
ploughs, making five or six furrows at a time ; these, and cultivators also,
being driven by steam, commonly from two engines, one on each head-
land, the plough being in between, and being worked backward and
forward by a rope from each engine alternately ; or, one engine only is
used, with a capstan on the other headland, by another mode known as
the roundabout system, where the engine is fixed, and the rope carried
round about the field. Or else ploughs and cultivators are worked by
ropes from two capstans placed on the two headlands, and driven by
means of a light quick-going rope, actuated by an engine the position

of which is not changed. And then we have reaping machines, worked
at present by horses, but how long it Mill be before the energy residing

in a battery or that in a reservoir of compressed air will supersede horse-
power, to drive the reaping-machine, I don't know, but I don't suppose

it will be very long. The mowing and reaping machines not only cut

--tbe crop and distribute it in swathes in the case of tlie reaping machine

in bundles, but now, in the instance of these latter machines, are com-

petent to bind it into sheaves. In lieu of hand-tedding hay-making

machines are employed, tossing the grass into the air so as to thoroughly

aerate it, taking advantage of every brief interval of fine weather ; and

seeds and manure are distributed by machine with unfailing accuracy.

The soil is drained by the aid of properly constructed ploughs for

preparing the trenches, roots are steamed and sliced as food for cattle,

and the threshing machine no longer merely beats out the grain, but

screens it, separates it, and elevates the straw so as to mechanically

build it up into a stack. I don't know a better class of machine than

the agricultural portable engine. Every part of it is perfectly propor-

tioned and made ;  it is usually of  the locomotive                                             type                        and  the  economy
                                                                                                                         ;

of fuel in its use is extremely great. I cannot help thinking that the

improvement in this respect which has taken place in these engines, and

the improvement of agricultui'al machinery generally, is very largely due

to the Royal Agricultural Society, one of the most enterprising bodies in

England.

I now come to the very last subject I jiroposo to speak itpon, and

that is Printing ^lachiner)/, and especially as applied to the printing of

newspapers. In 1831 Ave had the steam press, sending out a few

hundred copies in an hour, and doing that upon detached sheets ; and

thus many hours were required for an edition of some thousands.

The only way in those days of expediting the matter would have been

to have recomposed the paper, involving, however, double labour to

the compositors, and a double chance of error. At the present day we

have by the Walter Press the paper printed on a continuous sheet, at a

rate per hour at least three times as great as that of the presses of 1831
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and, by the aid of papier-mache moulds, within five minutes from the

starting of the first press, a second press can be provided with its stereo-

type plates and got to work, and a third one in the next five minutes

and thus the wisdom of our senators, which has been delivered as late

as three o'clock in the morning, is ready to be transmitted by the news-

paper train leaving Eus ton at 5.15 a.m.

This is the last subject with which I shall trouble the Section. I

have  purposely omitted  telegraphy                                                    I  have  purposely                   omitted artillery,
                                                                                    ;

textile fabrics, and the milling and preparation of grain. These and

other matters I have omitted for several reasons. Some I have omitted

because I was incompetent to speak upon them, others because of the

want of time, and others because perhaps they more properly belong to

Section A.

I hope, Sir, although your address, dealing with the future, was un-

doubtedly the right address for a President to deliver, and although it is

equally right that we should not content ourselves with merely looking

back in a ' rest and be thankful ' spirit at the various progress which this

paper records, it may, nevertheless, be thought well that there should

have been brought before the Section, in however cursory a manner,

some notice of Mechanical Development during the past fifty years.

                THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.

       The President delivered the following Address :

 On the Sources of Energy in Nature available to Man for the Production of

                                                Mechanical Effect.

 During the fifty years' life of the British Association, the Advancement of Science
 for which it has lived and worked so well has not been more marked in any

 --department than in one which belongs very decidedly to the Mathematical and

 Physical Section the science of Energy. The very name energy, thouo-h first
 used in its present sense by Dr. Thomas Young about the beginning of this cen-
 tury, has only come into use practically after the doctrine which defines it had
 during the first half of the British Association's life, been raised from a mere
 formula of mathematical dynamics to the position it now holds of a principle
 pervading all nature and guiding the investigator in every field of science.

    A little article communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburo-h a short

 time before the commencement of the epoch of energy under the title ' On the
 Sources Available to Man for the Production of Mechanical Effect ' ' contained the

-following :

      ' Men can obtain mechanical effect for their own purposes by working mechani-

 cally themselves, and directing other animals to work for them, or by usino- natural
 heat, the gravitation of descending solid masses, the natural motions of water and
 air, and the heat, or galvanic currents, or other mechanical effects produced bv
·chemical combination, but in no other way at present known. Hence the stores

 from which mechanical effect may be drawn by man belong to one or other of

 the following classes :

      ' I. The food of animals.

       ' II. Natural heat.

       ' III. Solid matter found in elevated positions,

     ' IV. The natural motions of water and air.

      ' V. Natural combustibles (as wood, coal, coal-gas, oils, marsh-gas, diamond,
native sulphur, native metals, meteoric iron).

      'VI. Artificial combustibles (as smelted or electrically-deposited metals,
 hydrogen, phosphorus).

     'In the present communication, known facts in natural history and physical
science, with reference to the sources from which these stores have derived their

mechanical energies, are adduced to establish the following general con-

·clusions :

     '1. Heat radiated from the sun (sunlight being included in this term) is the

principal source of mechanical effect available to man.'- From it is derived the whole

that date).

* A general conclusion equivalent to this was published by Sir John Herschel in.

1833. See his Astronomy, edit. 1819, § (399).

mechanical effect obtained by means of animals working, water-wheels worked by
livers, steam-engines, galvanic engines, windmills, and the sails of ships.

     '2. The motions of the earth, moon, and sun, and their mutual attractions, con-
stitute an important source of available mechanical effect. From them all, but
chiefly no doubt from the earth's motion of rotation, is derived the mechanical

effect of water-wheels driven by the tides.

    ' 3. The other known sources of mechanical effect available to man are either

--terrestrial that is, belonging to the earth, and available without the influence of
-- --any external body or meteoric that is, belonging to bodies deposited on the

earth from external space. Terrestrial sources, including mountain quarries and

mines, the heat of hot springs, and the combustion of native sulphur, perhaps
also the combustion of inorganic native combustibles, are actually used ; but the
mechanical effect obtained from them is very inconsiderable, compared with that
which is obtained from sources belonging to the two classes mentioned above.

Meteoric sources, including only the heat of newly-fallen meteoric bodies, and the

combustion of meteoric iron, need not be reckoned among those available to man

for prabtical purposes.'

    Thus we may summarise the natural sources of energy as Tides, Food, Fuel^

Wind, and Eain.

  --Among the practical sources of energy thus exhaustively enumerated, there is

only one not derived from sun-heat that is the tides. Consider it first. I have called!

it prdctical, because tide-mills exist. But the places where they can work usefully

are very rare, and the whole amount of work actually done bj' them is a drop to
Athe ocean of work done by other motors.
                                          tide of two meters' rise and fall, if we-

imagine it utilised to the utmost by means of ideal water-wheels doing with per-

fect economy the whole work of filling and emptying a dock-basin in infinitely

short times at the moments of high and low water, would give just one metre-ton

per squai-e metre of area. This work done four times in the twenty-four hours

amounts to l-1620th of the work of a horse-power. Parenthetically, in explanation,,

I may say that the French metrical equivalent (to which in all scientific and prac-

--tical measurements we are irresistibly drawn, notwithstanding a dense barrier of in-

sular prejudice most detrimental to the islanders), the French metrical equivalent

of James Watt's ' horse-power ' of 550 foot-pounds per second, or 33,000 foot-pounds-

per minute, or nearly two million foot-pounds per hour, is 75 metre-kilogrammes

per second, or 4^ metre-tons per minute, or 270 metre-tons per hour. The French

ton of 1,000 kilogrammes used in this reckoning is 0-984 of the British ton.

Returning to the question of utilising tidal energy, we find a dock area of

162.000 square metres (which is little more than 400 metres square) required for

100 horse-power. This, considering the vast costliness of dock construction, is
obviously prohibitory of every scheme for economising tidal energy bj^ means of
artificial" dock-basins, however near to the ideal perfection might be the realised

--tide-mill, and however convenient and non-wasteful the accumulator whether

--Faure's electric accumulator, or other accumulators of energy hitherto invented or

to be invented which might be used to store up the energy yielded by the tide-
mill during its short harvests about the times of high and low water, and to give
it out when wanted at other times of six hours. There may, however, be a dozen
places possible in the world where it could be advantageous to build a sea-wall
across the mouth of a natural basin or estuary, and to utilise the tidal energy of

filling it and emptying it by means of sluices and water-wheels. But if so much
could be done, it would in many cases take only a little more to keep the water
out altogether, and make fertile land of the whole basin. Thus we are led up to

the interesting economical question, whether is forty acres (the British affriculiural
measure for the area of 162,000 square metres) or 100 horse-power more valuable.

The annual cost of 100 horse-power night and day, for 365 days of the year, ob-
tained through steam from coals, may be about ten times the rental of forty acres
at 21. or 3/. per acre. But the value of land is essentially much more than its
rental, and the rental of land is apt to be much more than 21 or 3/. per acre in
places where 100 horse-power could be taken with advantage from coal through

steam. Thus the question remains unsolved, with the possibility that in one place
              TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  515

the answer may be one hundred horse-power, and in another forttj acres. But,

indeed, the question is hardly worth answering, considering the rarity of the cases,

if they exist at all, where embankments for the utilisation of tidal energy are

practicable.

    Turning now to sources of energy derived from sun-heat, let us take the wind

first. When we look at the register of British shipping and see 40,000 vessels, of

which about 10,000 are steamers and 30,000 sailing ships, and when we think
how vast an absolute amount of horse-power is developed by the engines of those
steamers, and how considerable a proportion it forms of the whole horse-power

taken from coal annually in the whole world at the present time, and when we

consider the sailing ships of other nations, which must be reckoned in the account,

and throw in the little item of windmills, we find that, even in the present days
of steam ascendency, old-fashioned Wind still supplies a large part of all the
energy used by man. But however much we may regret the time when Hood's

young lady, visiting the fens of Lincolnshire at Christmas, and writing to her

dearest friend in London (both sixty years old now if they are alive), describes the

delight of sitting in a bower and looking over the wintry plain, not desolate,

because ' windmills lend revolving animation to the scene,' we cannot shut our

eyes to the fact of a lamentable decadence of wind-power. Is this decadence

permanent, or may we hope that it is only temporary ? The subterranean coal-

--stores of the world are becoming exhausted surely, and not slowly, and the price

of coal is upward bound upward bound on the whole, though no doubt it will

have its ups and downs in the future as it has had in the past, and as must be the

case in respect to every marketable commodity. When the coal is all burned ; or,

long before it is all burned, when there is so little of it left and the coal-m'ines
from which that little is to be excavated are so distant and deep and hot that its

price to the consumer is greatly higher than at present, it is most probable that

vdndmills or wind-motors in some form will again be in the ascendant, and that
wind will do man's mechanical work on land at least in proportion comparable to
its present doing of work at sea.

    Even now it is not utterly chimerical to think of wind superseding coal in

--some places for a very important part of its present duty that of giving light.
Indeed, now that we "have dynamos and Faure's accumulator, the little want to let
Athe thing be done is cheap vsdndmills.
                                         Faure cell containing 20 kilogrammes

of lead and minium charged and employed to excite incandescent vacuum-lamps

has a light-giving capacity of 60-candle hours (I have found considerably more
in experiments made by myself; but I take 60 as a safe estimate). The charging

may be done uninjuriously, and vsdth good dynamical economy, in any time from

six hours to twelve or more. The drawing-off of the charge for use may be done
safely, but somewhat wastefuUy, in two hours, and very economically in any time
of from five hours to a week or more. Calms do not last often longer than three

or four days at a time. Suppose, then, that a five days' storage-capacity suffices

(there may be a little steam-engine ready to set to work at any time after a four-
days' calm, or theuser of the light may have a few candles or oil-lamps in reserve,

and be satisfied with them when the wind fails for more than five days). One of
the twenty kilogramme cells charged when the windmill works for five or six

hours at any time, and left with its 60-candle hours' capacity to be used six hours

a day for five days, gives a 2-candle light. Thus thirty-two such accumulator cells
80 used would give as much light as four burners of London 16-candle gas. The
probable cost of dynamo and accumulator does not seem fatal to the pfan, if the
windmill could be had for something comparable with the prime cost of a steam-

engine capable of working at the same horse-power as the windmill when in good
action. But windmills as hitherto made are very costly machines ; and it does not

seem probable that, without inventions not yet 'made, wind can be economically

used to give light in any considerable class of cases, or to put energy into store for
work of other kinds.

    Consider, lastly, rain-power. When it is to be had in places where power is

wanted for mills and factories of any kind, water-power is thoroughly appreciated.

From time immemorial, water-motors have been made in large variety for utilis-

in" rain-power in the various conditions in which it is presented, whether in
rapidly-flowing rivers, in natural waterfalls, or stored at heights in natural lakes
or artificial reservoirs. Improvements and fresh inventions of machines of this class
still go on ; and some of the finest principles of mathematical hydrodjnamics have,
                                                     to a considerable degree, with its
in the lifetime of the   British Association, and,   the theory of hydraulic mechanism
assistance, been put in  requisition for perfecting

Aand extending its practical applications.                     suc,h        .,  sources    ,

        first question occurs : Are we necessarily limited to         natural

water-power as are supplied by rain falling on hill-country, or may we look to the
collection of rain-water in tanks placed artificially at sufficient heights over flat
country to supply motive power economically by driving water-wheels ? To answer
it : Suppose a height of 100 metres, which is very large for any practicable build-
ino- or for columns erected to support tanks; and suppose the annual rainfall to be
three-quarters of a metre (30 inches). The annual yield of energy would be 75
metre-tons per square metre of the tank. Now one horse-power for 365 times 24
hours is 236,500 foot-tons ; and therefore (dividing this by 75) we find 3,153
square metres as the area of our supposed tank required for a continuous- supply of
one horse-power. The prime cost of any such structure, not to speak of the value
Weof the land which it would cover, is utterly prohibitory of any such plan for utilis-
ino- the motive power of rain.  may or may not look forward hopefully to the

time when windmills will again ' lend revolving animation ' to a dull fiat country
but we certainly need not be afraid that the scene will be marred by forests of iron
columns taking the place of natural trees, and gigantic tanks overshadowing the

fields and blackening the horizon.

    To use rain-power economically on any considerable scale we must look to the
natural drainage of hill country, and take the water where we find it either actually
falling or stored up and ready 'to fall when a short artificial channel or pipe can be
provided for it at moderate cost. The expense of aqueducts, or of underground

--water-pipes, to carry water to any great distance any distance of more than a few
--miles or a few hundred yards is much too great for economy when the yield to be

provided for is power ; and such works can only be undertaken when the water itself
IS what is wanted. Incidentally, in connection with the water-supply of towns,
some part of the energy due to the head at which it is supplied may be used for
power. There are, however, but few cases (I know of none except Greenock) in
which" the energy to spare over and above that devoted to bringing the water to

where it is wanted, and causing it to flow fast enough for convenience at every
opened tap in every house or factory, is enough to make it worth while to make

arrangements for letting the water-power be used without wasting the water-sub-

stance. The cases in which water-power is taken from a town supply are generally
verv small, such as working the bellows of an organ, or 'hair-brushing by ma-
chinery,' and involve simply throwing away the used water. The cost of energy

thus obtained must be something enormous in proportion to the actual quantity of

the energy, and it is only the smallness of the quantity that allows the convenience

of havingit when wanted at any moment, to be so dearly bought.
     For anything of great work by rain-power, the water-wheels must be in the

place where the water-supply with natural fall is found. Such places are gener-
allv far from great towns, and the time is not yet come when great towns grow
bvnatural selection beside waterfalls, for power ; as they grow beside navigable

rivers for shipping. Thus hitherto the use of water-power has been confined
chieflv to isolated factories which can be conveniently placed and economically
vforked in the neighbourhood of natural waterfalls. But the splendid suggestion

made about three years ago by Mr. Siemens in his presidential address to the In-
stitution of Mechanical Engineers, that the power of Niagara might be utilised, by

transmitting it electrically to great distances, has given quite a fresh departure for

desion in respect to economy of rain-power. From the time of Joule's experi-

mental electro-magnetic engines developing 90 per cent, of the energy of a Voltaic
battery in the form of weights raised, and the theory of the electro-magnetic trans-
mission of energy completed thirty years ago on the foundation aff"orded by the
train of experimental and theoretical investigations by which he established his

dynamical equivalent of heat in mechanical, electric, electro-chemical, chemical,

electro-magnetic, and thermoclastic phenomena, it had been known that potential

energy from any available source can be transmitted electro-magnetically by means

of an electric "current through a v^ire, and directed to raise weights at a distance,

with unlimitedly perfect economy. The first large-scale practical application of

electro-magnetic machines was proposed by Holmes in 1854, to produce the elec-

tric light for lighthouses, and persevered in by him till he proved the availability

of his machine to the satisfaction of the Trinity House and the delight of Faraday

in trials at Blackwall in April, 1857, and it was applied to light the South Fore-

land lighthouse on December 8, 1858.  This  gave  the     impulse  to                     invention                                                by

which the electro-magnetic machine has been brought from the physical laboratory

--into the province of engineering, and has sent back to the realm of pure science a

beautiful discovery that of the fundamental principle of the dynamo, made triply
and independently, and as nearly as may be simultaneously, in 1867 by Dr. Werner

Siemens, Mr. S. A. Varley, and Sir Charles Wheatstone ; a discovery which con-

stitutes an electro-magne'tic analogue to the fundamental electrostatic principle of

Nicholson's revolving doubler, resuscitated by Mr. C. F. Varley in his instrument

·for generating electricity;' patented in 1860; and by Holtz in his celebrated

electric machine and by myself in my ' replenisher ' for multiplying and main-
                                                                                           ;

taining charges in Leyden jars for heterostatic electrometers, and in the electri-

fier for the siphon of my recorder for submarine cables.

    The dynamos of Gramme and Siemens, invented and made in the_ course of
these fourteen years since the discovery of the fundamental principle, give now a

ready means of realising economically on a large scale, for many important practical

applications, the old thermo-dynamics of Joule in electro-magnetism ; and, what

particularly concerns us now in connection with my present subject, they make_ it

possible to" transmit electro-magnetically the work of waterfalls through long in-

--sulated conducting wires, and use it at distances of fifties or hundreds of miles

from the source, ^vith excellent economy better economy, indeed, in respect to
proportion of energy used to energy dissipated than almost anything known in

ordinary mechanics" and hydraulics for distances of hundreds of yards instead of

hundreds of miles.

    In answer to questions put to me in May, 1879,^ by the Parliamentary Com-

mittee on Electric Lighting, I gave a formula for calculating theamount of energy

transmitted, and the amount dissipated by being converted into heat on the
way, through an insulated copper conductor of any length, with any given

electro-motive force applied to produce the current. Taking Niagara as ex-

ample, and with the idea of bringing its energy usefully to Montreal, Boston,

New York, and Philadelphia, I calculated the formula for a distance of 300

British statute miles (which is greater than the distance of any of those four
cities trom Niagara, and is the radius of a circle covering a large and very
important part of the United States and British North America ), and found almost

myto surprise that, even with so great a distance to be provided for, the con-

ditions are thoroughly practicable with good economy, all aspects of the case
carefully considered. The formula itself will be the subject of a technical com-

Amunication to Section in the course of the Meeting on which we are now enter-

ing. I therefore at present restrict myself to a slight statement of results.

     1. Apply dynamos driven by Niagara to produce a difference of potential of
80,000 volts between a gnod earth-connection and the near end of a solid copper

wire of half an inch (1-27 centimetre) diameter, and 300 statute miles (483 kilo-

metres) length.                                                                        .    . 1.

2.  Let resistance by driven  dynamos doing work, or      by  electric                    lights,  or,                                             as  I

can now say, by a Faure battery taking in a charge, be applied to keep the remote

end at a potential differing by 64,000 volts from a good earth-plate there.

3. The result will be a current of 240 webers through the wire taking energy

from the Niagara end at the rate of 26,250 horse-power, losing 5,250 (or 20 per

the insulation.

6. The cost of the copper wire, reckoned at Sd. per lb., is 37,000/. ; the interest

on which at 5 per cent, is 1,900^. a year. If 5,250 horse-power at the Niagara end

costs more than 1,900/. a year, it would be better economy to put more copper

into the conductor ; if less, less. I say no more on this point at present, as the
economy of copper for electric conduction will be the subject of a special com-

munication to the Section.

I shall only say, in conclusion, that one great difficulty in the way of economis-

ing the electrical transmitting power to great distances (or even to moderate
distances of a few kilometres) is now overcome by Faure's splendid invention.

-- --High potential as Siemens, I believe, first pointed out is the essential for

good dynamical economy in the electric transmission of power. But what
are we to do with 80,000 volts when we have them at the civilised end of

the wire ? Imagine a domestic servant going to dust an electric lamp with

80,000 volts on one of its metals ! Nothing above 200 volts ought on any

account ever to be admitted into a house or ship or other place where safe-

guards against accident cannot be made absolutely and for ever trustworthy against

all possibility of accident. In an electric workshop 80,000 volts is no more

dangerous than a circular saw. Till I learned Faure's invention I could but think

of step-down dynamos, at a main receiving station, to take energy direct from the

electric main with its 80,000 volts, and supply it by secondary 200-Tolt dynamos or

100-volt dynamos, through proper distributing wires, to the houses and factories

and shops where it is to be used for electric lighting, and sewing-machines, and

lathes, and lifts, or whatever other mechanism wants driving power. Now the

thing is to be done much more economically, I hope, and certainly with much

greater simplicity and regularity, by keeping a Faure battery of 40,000 cells always

being charged direct from the electric main, and applying a methodical system of

removing sets of 50, and placing them on the town-supply circuits, while other

sets of 50 are being regularly introduced into the great battery that is being

charged, so as to keep its number always within 50 of the proper number, which
would be about 40,000 if the potential at the emitting end of the main is 80,000

volts.

   1. On the Possihility of the Existence of Intra-Mercurial Planets.^
                           By Balfour Stewart, LL.D., F.B.S.

     It is a somewhat frequent speculation amongst tliose engaged in sun-spot

research to regard the state of the solar surface as influenced in some way by the

positions of the planets.
     In order to verify this hypothesis, observers have tried whether there appear

to be solar periods exactly coinciding with certain well-known planetary periods.

    This method has been adopted by the Kew observers (Messrs. De La Kue,

Stewart, and Loewy), who had an unusually large mass of material at their dis-

posal, and they have obtained from it the following results :

    1. An apparent maximum and minimum of spotted area approximately corre-

sponding in time to the perihelion and aphehon of Mercury.

sponding in time to the conjunction and opposition of Mercury and Jupiter.

    3. An apparent maximum and minimum of spotted area approximately corre-

sponding in time to tlie conjunction and opposition of Venus and Jupiter.

    4. An apparent maximum and minimum of spotted area approximately corre-

sponding in time to the conjunction and opposition of Venus and Mercury.

Whatever truth there may be in these conclusions, it appears to be quite certain

that pei'iodical relations between the various knotun planets will not account for all

the sun-spot inequalities with which we are acquainted. They may account for

some, but certainly not for all. For there are solar inequalities of short duration,

which, presuming them to be real, can only be accounted for on the planetary

hypothesis by supposing the existence of several unknown intra-mercui-ial planets.

     In conjiuiction with Mr. William Dodgson I have devised a method for detecting
imknown niequalities, which, when applied to the sun, reveals a period in sun-spots

of 24'011 days. Is this the period of an intra-mercurial planet ?

      It is quite easy to put this hypothesis to a test, taking for our guidance the

results obtained by the Kew observers. For what do these results exhibit ? In the

first place, they exhibit the probability of a sun-spot inequality corresponding to

the period of Merciu-y round the sun ; and in the next, they exhibit the probability

of similar inequalities corresponding to the synodic period of Mercury and Venus,

and to that of Mercuiy and Jupiter. Now, if there be an intramercuiial planet of

period 24011 days, it will have the following synodic periods :
           ....With Mercuiy
           ....With Venus                       33-025 days.
           ....With Jupiter                     26-884 ,,
                                                24-145 ,,

     In conjunction with Mr. Dodgson I have applied the above method of analysis
with the view of ascertaining whether there be well-marked sun-spot inequali-

ties nearly corresponding to these periods, and we have obtained the following

results :

           A very prominent inequality of period 32-955 days.
           A very prominent inequality of period 26-871 ,,
           A less prominent inequality of period 24-142 ,,

It will thus be noticed that there are prominent sun-spot inequalities, the

periods of which agi-ee very well with the synodic periods of the supposed planet

with Merciu-y, Venus, and Jupiter, more especially if we bear in mind that this is

only a first approximation.

     The test, however, is not yet complete. Referring once more to the results of

the Kew observers, it will be noticed that we have approximately maxima of sun-

spot areas when Mercury and Venus, or when Mercury and Jupiter are in conjunc-

tion. Now, if we assume that there is an intra-mercurial planet of period

24-011 days, we areas yet unable to assign its exact position inecliptical longitude

Weat any moment.  know its period, and we may presume that it has consider-

Weable excentricity, but we know nothing else.  may, however, assume as most

probable that the maximiun point of the inequality of period 32-955 days

corresponds to the conjunction of the planet with Mercury, and so on for the other

inequalities. On this assumption, and knowing the average rate of motion of the

planet in its orbit, we may decide approximately its position at a given epoch in-

dependently from each of the three synodic periods, above mentioned, and these

positions ought to agi-ee together, if our hypothesis be correct.

I have done this approximately, but am not able to bring exact figures be-

fore this meeting. The agreement is'^as gi-eat as can be expected, bearing'm mind that

we know only the average rate of motion of the planet, and not the variations

of its rate, inasmuch as we are ignorant of its excentricity. I think I may state

that three independent values of its position, corresponding to January 1, 1832, will

be obtained, and that the mean difierence of a single value from the mean of the

whole will probably not be more than twenty degi-ees. It would thus appear from this

investigation that the evidence is in favour of the sun-spot inequality of 24011 days

being due to an intra-mercurial planet.

2, On the Photographic Spectrum of Comet ' b ' 1881.       5y William

                           HuGGiNs, D.G.L., LL.D., F.B.S.

                                         [Plate XIV.]

     In the years 1866 and 1868 I applied the spectroscope to the light of comets,,
and in the latter year I showed that the three bright bands in the visible part of

the spectrum agree with the similar bright bands which are seen when an induction
spark is taken in olefiant gas.^ The same bands are also seen in the flames of many
compounds of carbon. I was inclined at that time to consider that these bands
were due to the vapour of carbon. Subsequent investigations which have been
made on the spectra of the compounds of carbon, appear to make it probable that
these bands are the spectrum of a compound of carbon with hydrogen. The obser-

vations (1868) showed the presence of carbon, probably in combination with
hydrogen, in the cometary matter.

      Since that time luitil the present year, no comet has appeared sufficiently bright

to allow of the observations on its spectrum being extended to the ultra-violet
region. The apparatus with which I had successfully photographed the spectra of
stars was especially suited to this purpose." It consists essentially of a spectroscope,

furnished with a prism of Iceland spar and lenses of quartz, placed so that the slit

shall be in the principal focus of a mirror 18 inches in diameter, equatorially

mounted, and driven by an electrically controlled clock.

     On the evening of June 24th (1881), I directed this instrument, armed with a
very sensitive gelatine plate, to the head of Comet ' b,' so that the nucleus .should be

upon one half of the slit. After an exposure of one hour, the open half of the slit
was clo,sed, the shutter withdrawn fi-om the other half, and the instrument was then

directed to Arcturus for fifteen minutes.

      After development the plate presented a verj' distinct spectrum of the comet,

together with that of the star, for comparison.

     The spectrum of the comet conisists of two spectra supei-posed upon each other

a continuous spectrum, which extends from about F to a little distance beyond H.
In this continuous spectrum can be seen the Fraunhofer lines G, h, H, K, and many

 others. This spectrum is therefore due to reflected solar light.
      The second spectrum consists of two sets of bright lines, and a suspicion of the

 presence of a third set. These lines are obviously to be referred to original light
from the comet.

      The strongest set consists of two bright lines in the commencement of the
 ultra-violet region. Measures, made by the aid of the compari.son star-.spectrum,
^ive for these bright lines the wave-lengths 3883 and 3870. The less refrangible
.line is much .stronger, and a faint luminosity can be traced from it to a little
 beyond the second line 3870. There can be, therefore, no doubt that these lines
 represent the brightest end of the ultra-violet group, which appears under certain

 circumstances in the spectra of the compounds of carbon. Professors Liveing and
 Dewar have found for the strong line at the beginning of the group, the wave-
 length 3882-7, and for the second line 3870-5.

     I am also able to see upon the continuous solar spectrum, a distinct, though

 Gfainter, impression of a group of lines between and h. There can be little doubt

.that this group is the one for the least refrangible limit of which the wave-length
 4220 is given by Professors Liveing and Dewar.

     An increase of brightness in the continuous spectrum is also seen between h

.and H, which may be due to other bright lines, but the photograph is not strong

 enough to admit of any certain conclusion on this point.

      On June 25, a second photograph was obtained with an exposure of an hour

 and a half. This photograph, notwithstanding the longer exposure, is fainter, but
 shows distinctly the bright lines in the ultra-violet, and the continuous .spectrum.

     These photographs confirm the results of my earlier observations on comets,

 that part of their light is reflected sunlight, and part is original light; and, further,

 that carbon is present in the cometary matter. The new bright groups in the

 comet's spectrum which the photographs have revealed to us, are certainly charac-
  teristic of substances containing carbon.

      In their paper ' On the spectra of the compounds of carbon ' (' Proc. Koy. Soc'
 vol. XX. p. 494), Professors Liveing and Dewar bring forward evidence to show
 that these two groups indicate the presence of cyanogen, and are not to be seen in

 hydrocarbons unless nitrogen is also present. If this be the case the photograph
 supplies us with strong evidence of the presence of nitrogen in the comet, in addi-
 ·tion to the carbon and hydrogen shown to be there by the bright groups in the

 visible region of the spectrum. It is of great interest in connection with this re-

 sult, now that Schiaparelli has shown us the close relationship of meteors and

 comets, to mention the results of Professor Graham's experiments on the occluded
 gases from the meteoric iron of Lenarto (' Proc. Roy. Soc' xv. p. 502, 1867.)
 This iron gave nearly three times its volume of gas, consisting chiefly of hydrogen,
 with small quantities of carbonic oxide and nitrogen.

      Professor Wright's examination of the stony meteorites shows the oxides of

 carbon, chiefly the di-oxide, to be present in largest quantity, but he obtained also
 a small percentage of hydrogen" and nitrogen (' Amer. Journ. Scien.' vol. x., July,

 1875). Other kinds of meteors are known which contain hydrocarbons, even in

 considerable quantity. It is scarcely necessary to add that, under suitable condi-
 tions, the spectra of the gases from some meteorites will be similar to that observed
 from the light of comets,

      Messrs. Liveing and Dewar's experiments woidd seem to show that a high tem-
 perature must be present in the comet, if the cyanogen is fonned there, but if
cyanides should be found in meteorites this necessity would not exist.

     Whatever the views that may be entertained as to the forms of combination in

 which the carbon exists, there can be no doubt whatever of the presence of carbon
in comets. I should mention that Mr. Lockyer regards the two bright groups seen
in the photograph, and the three groups in the \-isible spectrum, to be due to the
vapour of carbon at diflfereut heat-levels ('Proc. Roy. Soc' vol. xxx. p. 461).

      It is of importance to mention the strong intensity in the photograph of the
lines 388-3 and 3870 as compared with the continuous spectrum, and the faint

bright group beginning at 4220. At this part of the spectrum, therefore, the light
emitted by the cometary matter exceeded by many times the reflected solar light.

     On August 21, 1 attempted to obtain, with an exposure of one hour, a photo-
graph of the spectrum of a large comet which has appeared since Comet 'c' 1881.
The evening was not very favourable, and the comet was at a low altitude and not so
brilliant as Comet ' b.' I am not able to see on the plate more than a faint trace of
the brightest lines (W. L. 3883 and 3870) of the spectrum obtained from the

former comet.

3. On a Prismatic Optometer. Bij Tempest Andekson, M.D., B.Sc.

It is well known that in the normal eye, with its accommodation relaxed, parallel

rays of light, that is, those from distant objects, are brought to a focus on thu

retina. Rays from near objects are divergent, and if they enter such an eye they are

not brought to a focus on the retina, but would be at some point behind it.' In

order that they may be so brought to a focus and form a distinct image on the

retina, an eSort of accommodation is necessary. This is performed by a small

muscle called the ciliary muscle, inside the eyeball, the ultimate effect of whose

contraction is an alteration in the shape and perhaps the condition of the lens,

which causes the rays to be more strongly refracted, and brings them to a focus on

the retina. The effect is in fact the same as if a convex lens were added to the

optical system of the eye. As age advances, the muscle and lens become stiflei:

and work with difiiculty. They are relieved of part of their work by putting a

convex glass in front of the eye. Hypermetropia is a condition in which the axis

of the eyeball is too short, compared with the refracting power of the lens. In it

an eff'ort of accommodation is necessary to see even distant objects clearly, and a

Astill stronger eff'ort to see near objects.  person sutfering from it requires convex

glasses. When both eyes are used together, the optic axes of both are directed to
--522
REPOKT 1881.

the object, so that in looking at a distant object they are directed parallel, and in
looking at a near one they converge. These movements are effected by the
external muscles of the eyeball, v^hich are supplied by branches of the same nerve

as the ciliary muscle. As a fact these movements of the ciliary muscle and of the

external muscles of the eyeball are associated, or habitually performed in conjunc-
tion ; that is, the brain has become accustomed to send an impulse to the one set of

muscles proportionate to that sent to the other. Any disturbance of this associa-

tion can only be accomplished by a distinct effort which, if severe or long continued,

is apt to be painful.

     Suppose a man has become presbyopic, i.e. his accommodation has gradually

become stiff, and its range reduced. In order to accommodate for rays from an
object at the ordinary reading distance of ten or twelve inches, he has now to
exert an effort equal perhaps to what he would have employed when young on
one four inches off, but the change has been gradual, and the convergence of
the eyes for twelve inches has become associated with this amount of effort. If

he now use convex glasses of suitable power, the want of refracting power is

 supplied, the effort of accommodation is reduced to
its natural amount, but the amount of convergence
which has become associated with this small effort is

now insufficient, and the eyes, instead of converging

to twelve inches, converge on a point several feet dis-
tant, so that double vision would be produced, unless
by a distinct effort the eyes were converged more, and
this effort is often painful and is expressed by the
term that the spectacles ' draw ' the eyes. After a

time new associations are formed and the spectacles

 can be used comfortably, but this does not happen in
all cases, and for these it is necessary to grind the
lenses on glasses of prismatic section. The action of
 the prism is so to bend the pencils of rays coming
 to the eyes that they appear to diverge from a point

corresponding to the new focal distance of the eyes

 provided with the spectacles.
      Sometimes the amount of prismatic effect required

 is calculated, but the calculation being baaed on gene-
 ral considerations does not always suit individual
 persons ; at other times prismatic glasses from a trial
 case are combined with the calculated spherical, or

 spherical and cylindrical glasses, until one is found
 with which vision is comfortable.

      In many cases it is not necessary to use glasses spe-
 cially ground on prisms, but suihcient to move the
 centres of the glasses nearer together. The glass being
 thicker in the centre, looking through the part near the edge produces an amount
 of prismatic effect which is often sufficient. If concave glasses are used, as in
 cases of short sight, then they must be further apart than the distance of the eyes

  in order to produce this effect.

       The object of the instrument exhibited is to find experimentally the amount of
  prismatic power, and the distance of the centres of the lenses, which is required in
  any individual case.

      Two circular frames each 2^ inches in diameter, and with teeth cut in their

  edges, are mounted so that the teeth gear into each other, and they can rotate
  freely, but in opposite directions. In the centre of each frame is mounted a prism
  of 18° ; one of the frames is graduated, and when the graduation is at 0° the axes of

  the prisms are parallel, so that parallel pencils of rays falling on both are deviated

  both in the same direction, and still parallel. Thus when the pair of prisms are

  arranged horizontally in front of a pair of eyes, an object looked at appears dis-
  placed up or down, but there is no lateral deviation on either. If the frames be
  rotated 90° in one direction, the prisms both have their bases inwards, or, if in the

other direction, both outwards, so that two pencils of rays are deviated to the

full power of the prisms. In the intermediate positions part of the prismatic

efl'ect is resolved in a direction at right angles to the line joining the
centres of the frames, and can be neglected as only producing parallel displace-

-ment of the image, and part is resolved in the direction of this line so as to produce

apparent separation or approximation of the images. This amount is read off from

the graduation which is constructed on to the following principle.

XAOSuppose a ray of light  perpendicular to the plane of the paper meets the

Apaper at (see figure). Suppose a prism be introduced at having an angle of

deflection B, the ray of light now falls on the paper at B.

If the piism be rotated through angle |8, the ray now falls on the paper at C.

Join OB, 00, and resolve 00 into vertical and horizontal co-ordinates CD, OD.

ODCD being neglected as described, we wish to find           the horizontal component

of the deflection.

Two other frames are placed in front of the prisms. They contain grooves to

told lenses or combinations of lenses, and are graduated so that cylindrical lenses

can be set at any desired angle. The frames can be separated or brought nearer

with greater accuracy by a wedge, and the distance of the centres of the glasses is

marked on the bearing. The whole is carried at the end of a graduated bar which

carries a sliding support for an object. This bar is graduated in inches for use in

calculation and also in focal lengths of a set of dioptric lenses.

A third prism is attached so that it can be placed between one of the frames

Whenand the object.  it is in position, the rays going through it to the eye

appear to come from an object higher than when it is absent. Double vision is

produced, and the eyes are left free to find their most comfortable position undis-

turbed by any efibrt to make the two images coalesce.

To use the instrument, the spherical and cylindrical elements of the spectacle

required are first found either by some of the ordinary methods or by the ophthalmo-

meter described in the Annual Volume for 1880, and the required lenses from the

trial case put in the appropriate frames. The third prism is interposed, and an

object, such as a vertical line, viewed at reading distance. If the images seen by

the two eyes are exactly one above the other, the prismatic adjustment is presum-

ably correct, the third prism is removed, and trial is made whether reading can be

carried on for some time without fatigue.

If the images are slightly displaced externally, trial is made whether shifting

the centres of the lenses nearer or further off, suffices to bring them into position.

If so, the distance is noted and sent as a direction to the optician. If the displace-

ment be more than can be corrected by this means, the prisms are rotated till the

desired effect is produced, and the amount of prismatic deviation to be given to the

proposed spectacles read off. The third prism is removed and reading practised as

above.

The existence of hydrocarbons in the solar atmosphere depends upon the evi-

dence of the absorption-spectra in the iiifra-red I'egion of certain hydrocarbons,,

which ha-\'e been photographed lately by the author, in conjunction with Colonel

Pasting, R.E. In these spectra certain lines were mapped, which, when a large

dispersive power was used, coincided with Fravmhofer's lines in the solar spectrum,

agreeing with them, not only in position, but also in relative intensities. That the

hydrocarbons are not due to our own atmosphere was shown by the fact that the
relative intensities did not vary with a high as compared with a low sun. The ' a '

group of lines in the solar spectrum was also pointed out as containing lines due to

the hydrocarbons; but that, as- they were faint lines, they would not materially

affect the validity of any argument which might be brought against the theory

should it be shown that this region altered in intensity with a high and low sun. At

the same time this group shoidd be carefully examined to see if the lines varied in in-

tensity whilst others remained constant. The similarity of the fundamental band of

A Bthe benzene series to the and lines was also noticed. The A. line was doubtless

Bsolar, whilst the line was, according to observation by careful spectroscopists, of

A Btelluric origin. Should it eventually prove that the  lines were due to
                                                  and

hydrocarbons, one would be present in the sun and the other in our own atmo-

sphere. To carbonic acid the latter could not be referred, since the absorption due

to that gas in a length equivalent to more than that found in the atmosphere had

been taken and gave absolutely no lines. If future observations showed the existence

of hydrocarbon vapour in the solar regions, a very interesting problem in solar

physics was opened out, to which attention would be given by the author and, he

hoped, other observers, in the immediate future.

1. On Surface-tension and Capillary Action. By Professor^OsBOKNE

Reynolds, F.E.S.                                         ^'-^r^

In the first place it was pointed out that, although surface-tension has hitherto

been considered as a statical or hydrostatical force only, such actions as the spread-
ing of oil upon water exhibit phenomena, and those of a very marked kind, which

depend, not on a statical force, but on the maintenance of this force while the sur-
face is contracting at a very high velocity. And, in the second place, it was pointed
out that the assumptions on which Laplace's theory of surface-tension is founded

are insufficient to explain these phenomena, which suggest certain relations between

the range of the inter-molecular attractive forces and the dimensions of these

molecules.

     It was shown that if the surface of pure water be touched at some point with a

slightly oiled needle, the oil spreads out quickly in a circular patch, which patch at
first extends with great rapidity. But it was not the rapidity of extension that was

so much the point of remark, as the motion of the surface of the pure water before
the advancing oil. In the iisual way this motion is shown by a rib or slight eleva-

tion of the water immediately at the edge of the oil. When the initial surface is

very clean the rib is always formed, but it only becomes apparent under peculiar

circumstances. It is often apparent on the surface of a deep pool formed at a
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             525

sharp tend of a stream, for instance, to anyone fishing. The more rapid flow into

the pool causes ascending currents, which, spreading out at the surface, give rise to

radial currents of pure water, which sweep back and hold at bay the oil or transparent

«cum on the surface of the rest of the pool, and which but for the outward motion

would rapidly extend over the pure surface. Under these circumstances the edge

of the scum is definitely marked by a fine rib, which shows itself in certain lights

Hs though a tine gut-line were floating on the water and were carried, first in one

direction and then in the other, according as the radial current or the spreading

force of the scum are in the ascendant. It is difficult to render this rib apparent

·on the surface of water contained in a vessel, although this may be one or two feet

--in diameter. This may be done, but the motion which gives rise to the rib may be

rendered apparent by other means, by dusting the surface of the pure water with

some insoluble powder, such as flowers of sulphur. The motion of the surface is

rendered apparent by the motion of the dust. It is then seen that the dust does not

fall back before the oil as though the surface of the pure water were in a general state

of contraction, for there is absolutely no motion in the dust except in the immediate

neighbourhood of the edge of the oil. It is as though the dust were swept back by

the advancing edge of the oil ; the dust, already swept up into a compact mass,

coming up to each fresh particle, pushes it before it, until a bright yellow band is

formed marking the edge of the oil. The residt is to give the impression that the

dust is being driven back by the oil-- as if the oil were spreading fi-om some

inherent expansive force ; but, as a matter of fact, the oil is being drawn forward by

the contraction of the dust-covered surface of the pure water, and the fact that the

dust does not move till the oil reaches it shows that the contraction takes place

entirely at the edge of the oil in an almost infinitely narrow band.

This phenomenon of surface-contraction is very remarkable, for it would be

inferred from other hydrodynamical phenomena that viscosity would to some

·extent resist the action of contraction, and thus tend to distribute this action eveix'

a considerable area, and that the contraction is not so distributed shows that there

is virtually no resistance to contraction, or that the surface-tension at the points at

which the surface is contracting is at least equal to the tension at those points of the

·surface which are at rest.

This conclusion implies much more than the tacit assumption, made by Laplace

--and subsequent writers, that the forces of cohesion obey the law of statical fluid

pressure equality in all directions. It is weU known as regards other phenomena

that this law holds only when fluids are at rest or in uniform motion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             whereas here
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

we have a case in which the same law holds for a portion of fluid which is mo^-ing

with great rapidity relative to the fluid in its immediate neighbourhood.

Laplace's theory is founded on an assumed attraction, between the molecules,

which attraction does not extend to sensible distances, and on the tacit assumption

already mentioned, that the pressure, whether impressed or molecular, is equal in
all directions. To explain the apparent absence of viscosity in the dynamical

phenomena some further assumptions are necessary. If the force of cohesion is due

to molecular attraction tliese dynamical phenomena require that the molecules

under their mutual attractions should not be in a state of equilibrium, except

in so far as they are held by the forces transmitted from one part of the fluid to

another.

Such a condition would exist if the range of attraction extended bevond the

distance of a single molecule, that is, if the molecules are spherical or in such a

state of motion that they cannot fit like bricks. But whatever might be the shape

of the molecides, if the forces of cohesion acted between adjacent molecules only,

then  they  would  be  in  equilibrium in all positions                                                                                                                            there would be no instability
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and no rapid contraction, although, according to Laplace's theory, the force

would be sufficient to prevent extension of the surface, and hence to explain the
statical phenomena of capillary tension such as the suspension of drops. It is

therefore argued that these dynamical phenomena are important, as throwin"- a
·certain amount of liglit on the character of the forces which cause cohesion

between molecules.

3. On a Question in the Theory of Lighting . By Lord Ratleigh, F.B.S.

It is known that a large part of the radiation from terrestrial sources is non-

luminous. Even in the case of the electric arc the obscure radiation amounts, ac-
cording to Tyndall, to eight-ninths of the whole, and of the remainder probably no

inconsiderable part is to be found in the extreme red rays of feeble limiinosity.

For practical purposes this obscure radiation is useless ; and the question forces
itself upon us, whether or no there is any necessity, absolutely inherent in the
case, for so large a proportion of waste. The following arrangement, not of course

proposed as practical, seems to prove that the question should be answered in fjxe

negative.

Conceive a small spherical body of infusible material, to which energy can be

communicated by electricity or otherwise, to be siurounded by a concentric re-

flecting spherical shell.  Under these circumstances no energy can escape                                                                                                                                                                                        but if a

small hole be pierced in the shell, radiation will pass through it. In virtue of the

suppositions which we have made, the emergent beam will be of small angle, and

may be completely dealt with at a moderate distance by a prism and lens. Let us

suppose then that a spectrum of the hole is formed and received upon a reflecting

plate so held at the focus as to return the rays upon the lens and prism. These

rays will re-enter the hole, and impinge upon the radiating body, which is thus

Weagain as completely isolated as if the shell were unperforated.  have now only

to suppose a portion of the focal plate to be cut away in order to have an apparatus

from which only one kind of radiation can escape. Whatever energy is communi-

cated to the internal body must ultimately undergo transformation into radiation of

the selected kind.

   4. On some uses of Faure's Accumulator in connection with Lighting hy
        Electricity. By Professor Sir William Thomson, M.A., F.B.S.

     The largest use of Faure's accumulator in electric lighting was to allow steam
or other motive power, driving dynamos, to work economically all day, or through-
out the twenty-four hours where the circumstances were such as to render this
economical, and storing up energy to be drawn upon when the light was required.
There was also a very valuable use of the accumulator in its application as an
adjunct to the dynamo, regulating the light-giving current and storing up an
irregular surplus in such a manner that stoppage of the engine would not stop
the light, but only reduce it slightly, and that there would always be a good
residue of two or three hours' supply of full lighting power, or a supply for eight

or ten hours of light for a diminished number of lamps. He showed an automatic

instrument which he had designed and constructed to break and make the circuit
between the Faure battery and the dynamo, so as automatically to fulfil the con-

ditions described in the paper. This instrument also guarded the coils of the

dynamo from damage, and the accumulator battery from loss, by the current
flowing back, if at any moment the electro-motive force of the dynamo flagged
so much as to be overpowered by the battery.

            5. On the Economy of Metal in Conductors of Electricity.
                By Professor Sir William Thomson, M.A., F.B.S.

     The most economical size of the copper conductor for the electric transmission of
energy, whether for the electric light or for the performance of mechanical work,
would be found by comparing the annual interest of the money value of the copper
with the money value of the energy lost annually in the heat generated in it
by the electric current. The money value of a stated amount of energy had not

   yet begun to appear in the City price-lists. If 10/. were taken as the par value of
   a horse-power night and day for a year, and allowing for the actual value being

   greater or less (it might be very much greater or very much less) according to cir-
   cumstances, it was easy to estimate the right quantity of metal to be put into the

   conductor to convey a current of any stated strength, such as the ordinary strength

   of current for the powerful arc light, or the tenfold strength current (of 240 webers)
   which the author had referred to in his address as practically suitable for deliver-

   ing 21,000 horse-power of Niagara at 300 miles from the fall.

       He remarked that (contrary to a very prevalent impression and belief) the

   gauge to be chosen for the conductor does not depend on the length of it through
   which the energy is to be transmitted. It depends solely on the strength of the
   current to be used, supposing the cost of the metal and of a unit of energy to be
   determined.

      ALet be the sectional area of the conductor ; s the specific resistance (accord-

   ing to bulk) of the metal ; and c the strength of the current to be used. The
   energy converted into heat and so lost, per second per centimetre, is scrjA ergs.

       Let p be the proportion of the whole time during which, in the course of a

   year, this current is kept flowing. There being 31^ million seconds in a year, the

   loss of energy per annum is

   of energy in it, is

        Taking 701. per ton as the price of copper of high conductivity (known as

   'conductivity copper' in the metal market), we have -00007/. as the price of a
   gramme. Multiplying this by 8-9 (the specific gravity of copper), we find, as the

   price of a cubic centimetre,

                        r= -00062/.                                                (6)

bable that the cost of an erg can be as small as 7;\- of what we have taken as the

in reality / is not constant ; it diminishes with increase of the magnetising force.

As it generally depends chiefly on the soft iron of the electro- magnet, and com-

paratively but little on the soft iron of the moving armature, or on iron mag-

netised by the current through the moving coils, it will generally be the case

Rthat / will, cceteris paribm, be diminished by increasing                                    and diminishing R'.
Hence the maximum of r/y is shown by (10) to require R' to be somewhat greater

than |<S': how much greater we  cannot  find  from the formula, without knowino°-

the law of the variation of I.

     Experience and natural selection seem to have led in most of the ordinary

dynamos, as now made, to the resistance in the electro-magnet being somewhat

leas than the resistance in the working coil, which is in accordance with the pre-

ceding theory.

     "Whether the useful work of the dynamo be light-giving, or power, or heating,
or electro-metallurgy, we may, lor simplicity, reckon it in any possible case by

Kreferring to the convenient standard case of a current through a conductor of given

resistance connecting the working terminals of the dynamo. This conductor,
inaccordance with general usage, I call the ' external circuit,' which is an abbrevi-

ation for the part of the whole circuit which is external to the dynamo. In the
case of the single-circuit dynamo, the current in the external circle is equal to that
through the working coil and electro-magnet, or c of our notation. Hence, by
Ohm's law

where I^ denotes the value of J for c = O. To understand it, remember we are

supposing no residual magnetism. For any speed subject to (^16), the dynamo

produces no current. When this limit is exceeded the electric equilibrium in

the circuit becomes unstable ; an infinitesimal current started in either direction

rises rapidly in strength, till it is limited by equation (15), through the diminu-

tion of I, which it produces. Thus, regarding 7 as a function of c, we have

in (15) the equation mathematically expressing the strength of the current main-

tained by the dynamo when its regular action is reached.     Using (15) in (10)
                                                                                  (17)

     In the shunt-dynamo the whole current, t-', of the working coil branches into

two streams, c through the electro-magnet, and --c' c through the external circuity

whose strengths are inversely as the resistances of their channels. Still calling

the resistance of the external circuit E, we therefore have

    The object of the paper was to show how an electric current can be made an
invisible and inmiaterial probe to determine the locality of a bullet in a wound
without touching the human body. It was an application of Hughes' Induction
Balance, and it had been tentatively used by Professor Graham Bell upon the
President of the United States. One pair of coils was made movable, and was

used for exploring the body, so as to bring the bullet in the line of the axis of the

coils, the depth of the bullet being determined by a second similar bidlet moved in
the axis of the fixed coils until equilibrium is obtained. It was sensitive to a

depth of five inches.

9. On the Electric Conductivity and Dichroic Absorption of Tourmaline.
                By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

Tourmaline possesses electric conductivity differing in difl^erent du-ections, and,

according to the author's experiments, conducts better across the optic and crystallo-

graphic axis than along it. Tourmaline also possesses the optical property of
dichroism, being more opaque, in general, along the axis than across it, equal thick-

nesses of crystal being considered, and absorbing the ordinary ray more than the ex-

traordinary                                         the  different  rays being unequally absorbed, giving therefore different
                                                 ;

tints in the two directions.

In the August number of the ' Philosophical Magazine ' the author has treated

the question of opacity of tourmaline by the aid of Maxwell's electromagnetic

theory of light, and has re-written Maxwell's equations for the particular case of

Kcrystalline media in which fi, the magnetic inductive capacity, the dielectric
Vcapacity, C the volume coefficient of electric conductivity, and the velocity of

propagation of a displacement differed in different directions. He deduces therefrom

that uniaxial crystals possessing maximum conductivity along the optic axis wiU

absorb the extraordinary ray more than the ordinary ; while those possessing

maximum conductivity across the axis will absorb the ordinary ray more than the

extraordinary. The former is the case in positive crystals such as smoky quartz
and lommellite (magnesic platinocyanide) : the latter' is the case in tourmaline.

Maxwell's equations lead to the following formula for the relative intensity of the
ordinary and extraordinary rays

                                                                               . -M.,C,V.,

VIn dispersive media the values of  are greater for red rays than for violet

waves. Hence in substances for which tlie axial conductivity of a medium is a

Vmaximum, the diti'erence in the values of for different rays will have less influence

on the value of tlie exponential which represents the intensity of transmission of

displacements parallel to that axis than on the value of the exponential which re-

presents the intensity of transmission of displacements perpendicular to that axis.

Hence in positive crystals (smoky quartz, lomellite, &c.) the dichroism takes the

form of greater opacity to red than to violet rays, in the ordinary ray relatively to

the extraordinaiy ray. In tourmaline and negative crystals, on the other hand,

the opacity is greater for red than for violet in the extraordinary ray, and less for

the ordinary ray. The author exhibited several specimens of coloured toiu-maline

cut into cubes, all of which were more opaque along the axis than across it ; and in

all of which the tint, as viewed along the axis, was browner than across the axis,

showing in that direction an increased absorption of violet, and blue, and green rays.

    The author also exhibited specimens of lomellite showing maximum opacity

Aand maximum absorption of blue rays in a direction perpendicular to the axis.

further consequence of the theory is, that in substances in which the electric conduc-

tivity has different values along three axes there will be trichroism.

It also foUows that dichroism is a general property of all colom-ed crystals in

which the electric conducti^-ities are unequal in different directions.

In conclusion it was pointed out that a mechanico-optical illustration of the

Atehaviovir of positive and negative crystals can be made as follows.    positive

crystal may be represented by placing metal wires vertically in a hollow cube of

glass filled with jelly or Canada balsam ; while a negative crystal may be repre-

sented by horizontal layers of wire gauze fixed in a similar cube. The former

conducts electricity best along a vertical axis, and is more transparent along than

across that axis. The latter conducts electricity better across the axis than along

it, and is more opaque to light along the axis than across it, as tourmaline is.

    On dt^termine une conique, dans un plan, par trois de ses points et par son

on cette conique est une hyperbole.
     Pour r(5pondre a cette question <5lementaire, Steiner a donniS, sans demonstration,

un tres-(5l6gant crit^riumi que je vais rappeler ici. J'en iiidiquerai brievement
une d($monstratipn. J'ajouterai, pour le cas ou la conique est una liyperbole, un
crit^rium permettant de distinguer le mode de r(5partition des trois points donnas
entre les deux branches de la courbe.

     Le probleme, qui consiste a determiner une section conique par trois de sea
points et par son centre, n'admet qu'une solution. Le changement du cenre de la
courbe, quand les donn^es restent r^elles, ce qu'on suppose, ne peut done avoir lieu
au moyen d'un passage par I'imaginaire. Le centre etant donncS, le changement ne
peut avoir lieu non plus au moyen du passage par le genre parabole, sans que la
courbe ne d^genere en deux droites paralleles. Imaginons done les trois points
donnes comme fixes et le centre comme mobile ; envisageons le lieu que doit parcourir
ce centre pour que la conique d^giSne'-e de la sorte : ce lieu stSparera sur le plan les
regions des centres des ellipses et les regions des centres des hyperboles. Or ce lieu se
compose des trois droites men(5es par les milieux des cot^s du triangle form^ par les
points doun^s. II suftit d'un instant d'attention pour conclure de la le critdrium de
Steiner, que voici

      Solent a, b, c les trois points donnes ; soient a', b', c' les ^nilieux des droites be, ca,
ab respectivement. Les droites b'c', c'a', a'b' partagent le plan en sept regions.

Trois de ces regions contiennent les points a, h,c. Ce sont les regions ou se trouvent

les centres des hg^ierboles passant par n, b, c. Dans les quatre autres se trouvent les

centres des ellipses,

     Une demonstration analogue s'applique au criterium que j'ajoute maintenant

     Pour que les trois jwints a, b, c soient sur- une seule et tneme branche d'hyperbole,
ilfaut et il snffit que le centre soit iilace dans un des angles op2}oses imr le sominet a
ceux du triangle a, b, c.

Si le centre est place a Vinterieur du triangle a b' c', le point a est sur une branche

d'hgperbole, les points b, c, sur l'autre. Si, de meme, le centre est place a Vinterieur
d'un des triangles b c' a' an ca'b', le jwint b, dans le premier cas, le point c, dans le
second, sont sur une branche, les deux nutres sur Vautre branche.

     Enfin, si le centre est place entre un cote du triangle a b c et la parallele « ce cote,

exterieurement d'aUleurs au triangle a be, les deux points situes sur le cote dunt il s'agit

sont sur une meme branche, et le troisieme point sur Vautre branche.
     La figure suivante permet de resumer aisement ces di-\-ers resultats. Les

regions des centres des ellipses sont figurees par des hacbures. Dans les regions

des centres des hyperboles, la repartition des points entre les branches est figures

ainsi                         le syniTiole a\bc signifie que a est sur une branche, b, c sur I'autre, et la
                           :

symbole abc signifie que les trois points sont sur une meme branche.

Le criterium de Steiner et celui que je viens d'y aj outer a'appliquent sans

modification au probleme de la determination d'une "conique par son centre et

trois de ses tangentes. Pour faire cette application, il suffira de remplacer, dans

ce qui precede, les droites be, ca, ah par les trois tangentes don n<les. La demonstra-

tion se fait aussi aisement et par des precedes analogues.

8. On a Diagram connected with the Transformation of Elliptic Functions.
                            By Professor Cayley, F.E.S.

The diagram relates to a known tlieorem, and is constructed as follows. Con-

y=+sider the infinite half-plane    draw in it, centre the origin and radius unity,

                                  \

a semicircle ; and draw the infinite half-lines x = -^, and x = ^; then we have a

region included between the lines, hut exterior to the semicircle. The region in

question may he regarded as a cm-\-ilinear triangle, with the angles 60^, 60°, and 0°.

The region may be moved parallel to itself in the direction of the axis of x, tkrough

the distance 1 ; say this is a  ' displacement ;                                                                 or we  may take the ' image of the
                                                                                                              '                                                                                                                '

region in regard to the semicircle. Performing any number of times, and in any

order, these two operations of making the displacement and of taking the image,

we obtain a new region, which is always a curvilinear triangle (bounded by circular

arcs) and having the angles 60°, 60", 6° ; and the theorem is that the whole series

of the new regions thus obtained completely covers, without interstices or over-

lapping, the infinite half-plane. The number of regions is infinite, and the size of

the successive regions diminishes very rapidly. The diagram was a coloured one,

exhibiting the regions obtained by a few of the successive operations.

              AbeVs Theorem. By Professor Cayley, F.B.S.

Consider a given cubic curve cut by a line in the points (.ij, y^), (.i\, i/^),

 (a.-,,  3/3) ; taking the first and second points at pleasure, these                                                   determine uniquely
         third point. Analytically , the equation of the curve                                                          determines y^ as a
the
function of .r,, and y^ ^s a function'of x^ : writing in the equation x^ = Xx^ + (1 - X).r2
y =Xm +(1 -- X) y.,, we have X by a simple equation, and thence x^; viz. x^ is
found as a function of .r,, .r,,, and of the nine constants of the equation. Hence

forming the derived equations (in regard to .I'l, .r,) of the first, second, and third

orders, we have (1+2 + 3 + 4 =)10 equations from which to eliminate the_ 9

constants ; x^ considered as a function of x^, x,, thus satisfies^ a partial differential

equation of the third order, independent of the particular cubic curve.

    To obtain this equation it is only necessary to observe that we have, by Abel's

theorem

                                         Xj X2 X3

where X^ is a given function of .rj and y,, that is of x^ ; and X^, X^j^xe. the like
functions of x^ and x^ respectively. Hence, considering x^ as a function of x^, x^,

which is the required partial differential equation of the third order.

This differential equation has a simple geometrical signification. Consider

three consecutive positions of the line meeting the cubic curve in the points 1, 2, 3

1', 2', 3' ; V, 2", 3" respectively : qua equation of the third order, the equation

should in effect determine 3" by means of the other points. And, in fact, the three

positions of the line constitute a cubic curve ; the nine points are thus the inter-

sections of two cubic curves, or, say, they are an ' ennead ' of points ; and any eight

of the points thus determine uniquely the ninth point.

          Euclidian Space. By Eobekt S. Ball, LL.D., F.B.8.

It is well known that the family of quadric surfaces denoted by the equation

        (a-k) x"+(b-k) if + (c~k) z^ + (a-k) (b-k) (e-k) =

denotes the screws about which a body with freedom of the thii'd order can twist.
The parameter k is the pitch.

    It is easily shown that this family of surfaces is inscribed in a common tetra-

hedi'on of which the faces are the imaginary planes denoted by

        \/b -- cx+ --/v/e ai/+ ^a -- bz+ A/b -- c \/c -- a t^a -- b =

and the three other expressions which can be produced by the indeterminateness of

the signs of the radicals.

Each of these surfaces also passes through the four points in which the two

cones

                                   x^ + 3/^ + s^ +
                                 ax^ + by^ + cs* =

are cut by the plane at infinity. These points lie one by one on each of the four

faces of the tetrahedron.

It occurred to me that these properties of the system of sui"faces were probably

only the ' sui-vivals ' of a more interesting geometrical system in non-euclidian space.

These anticipations have been fulfilled, and the result is to give a complete geo-

metrical theory of the statics and kinematics of a rigid body with three degrees of

freedom in non-euclidian space.

The most general motion of a body is produced by rotations around a pair of

lines which are conjugate polars with regard to the absolute. For convenience I

denote these rotations by a> cos a and <o sin a. The total amplitude of the motion

space.

shall do no work against a wrench on another screw.

A Bof common transversals can be drawn across the four lines
                                                                                                                                                                       A' B'; these are

Then the condition of which we are in search is,

               cos .r cos «/ sin (a + 0) -- sin x sin y cos (a -- ^) = 0.

If a system has freedom of the third order, there must be a doubly infinite

system of screws about which it can twist; among these let us take three of pitches
C Xa, viz. A, A' and B, B', and C
                                                                                                                                               Draw a transversal      across A, B, C-, then a/

will intersect A', B', C. Attribute to x a pitch - a, then x will be neutral to

A; B, C. Similarly y and s may be drawn across A, B, C. It is obvious that any

screw neutral to x, y, z, must belong to the required three-system. Hence it
ABC,follows that all the generators of the hyperboloid
                                                                                                                                                                       and of the same system.

as A, B, 0, must belong to the three-system, and thus we have the result that

All the, scren'S of given intch belonging to a three-system lie on tivo quadrics

lohich are reciprocal imlars with regard to the absolute. Each screw is made up of a
generator on one quadric, and its conjugate polar on the othe?-.

    Draw a common tangent plane to the absolute, and the two reciprocal quadrics
S and S'. Let T be the point in which this plane meets the absolute. It is obvious

T must lie on S and S , and that two rays through T in the tangent plane must be
a pair of conjiigate polars forming a screw with the given pitch. Let T L and

MT be the two generators of the absolute through T, then any pair of lines through
MT which formed an harmonic pencil with T L and T would be a pair of conju-

gate polars. The pitch of the screw of the system whose conjugate polars pass

through T is therefore ambiguous, and consequently every different pair of

hyperboloids for each different pitch must touch this tangent plane and pass

through M, T.

As there can be eight tangent planes to the absolute and a pair of reciprocal

quadrics, so it follows that every pair of quadrics must touch these planes and pass

Wethrough the eight points of contact.                                                                                                         thus have the one degree of freedom left

to the quadrics corresponding to the different varieties of pitch. In ordinary space

these planes reduce to the four already mentioned.

           = a be the bar which rotates about the fixed point O, and let          = 26

be the bar carrying the recording wheel, situated, say, at the distance c from its

middle point (see figure). Then, s denoting the distance recorded by the wheel when

B describes the perimeter of a closed curve.

in which k denotes the number of revolutions made by the bar AB.                  Hence

from (1)                        B-A = 2bs-4kTrbc.

In the use of the instrument two cases arise. First,

Bmay be exterior to the area ; in this case k = 0, and
Asince the point
A = 0, and we have  reciprocates over an arc of a circle,

                         B = 2bs.

Secondly,  may be within the area B, in which case

A = Tra- and k=l, hence

                    B = 2bs + Tr{a^-4bc).

The constant which is added to 26s in this case is the area of the circle whose

Oradius is OB, when the instrument is in such a position that the line joining

ABwith the wheel is perpendicular to  ; for OB- = a' -- {b + c)'^+{b -- c)^; and this

Bshould be the case, for if describe this cu'cle s is evidently = 0.

3. The theorem (1) may be employed also to express the area described by any
AB Apoint of the line
                      in terms of the areas of and B. Thus, if s denotes the

distance recorded by a wheel situated at the middle point of AB,

                    B-A = 26s                                     (2).

    Let C be a point at a distance c from the middle point of AB. The length of

AC ABis b + c, and the distance of its middle point from the middle point of

is -- ^ --(6 c) ; therefore the distance recorded by a wheel situated at the former

point would be

                                        s' = 8-k7r{b -- c),

(k denoting as before the number of revolutions of AB), and we have

                    C-A = {b + c)s' = {b + c)s-kTrib^-c^)               . . (3).

Eliminating s by means of (2),                                    . . . (4),

4. On Involutional (1 1) Correspondence. By Professor Genese, M.A.

     It is here proposed to say that there is an involutional (1, 1) correspondence he-

tween two pouits whose co-ordinates (say, areal) are .r : y : s, a : ^ : -y when if

               .f y: : s :: /i (a,0, y) :/, (a, ^,y) :/3 (a,^,y),

then

                       a : /3 : -y : : /i (,r, y, z) if^ (.r, y, s) l/g (.r, y, s).^

               /,, jTj, /g denoting three distinct homogeneous functions.

The following method gives five solutions of the problem suggested.                   Consider

the equations

                            F, (a, |3, y)        F, (a, ^, y)       '^
                                                                    (2')
                            Fg (^y^)       _ F4 (-^Y^L^s)
                                           - F,(a,i3,y)
                            F3(a,/3,y)

     It is clear that .r : y : s : : a : /3 : y is one solution. If then Fj, F^, F3, F^ be so

chosen that (1) and (2) admit of only one other common solution containing a, ^, y

that solution will by symmetry determine an involutional (1, 1) correspondence.

     Let 0", C° denote the loci represented by

                 F,{x,y,z)=yF,{.v,y,z)                         (3)

                 Fs {'V, y,z)=^ F, (.r, y, z) . . . . (4)

of the mth and nth degrees respectively.
    Then, y, ^ being chosen to make C" 0° intersect at a, /3, y, we have the curves

(1), (2).

   Now C", C° intersect in mn points ; for the solution of our problem p = mw -- 2

of these must be fixed points. Also C", 0" pass through m* and w^ fixed points

respectively : 0TM is determined by "^ "1^ ' points, &c.

Five solutions are obtained :

   A description was given of a new form of card-supporter for the Camphell Sun-

           _

shine Recorder, constructed by Mr. L. P. Casella at the suggestion of the author and
exhibited to the Section, It consists of a light frame capable of hwlding the slip of
cardboard to be burned by the sun in any desired position. It is arranged so
as to receive ordinary parallel strips of card at all times of the year, and to allow of
the instrument being employed on any part of the earth's surface without detriment

to its efficiency.

     The card-holders themselves are movable, so as to permit of the cards being
changed indoors or dried if wet, before removal, thereby avoiding tearing or mutila-
tion of the record in the operation. The instrument is also furnished with ap-

pliances for placing the card correctly in position to receive the sun's image.

7. On the Calibration of Merciirial Thermometers by BesseVs Method. By
    Professors T. E. Thorpe, Ph.B., F.R.8., and A. W. Rucker, M.A.

The authors have recently had occasion to calibrate with great care a number

of mercurial thermometers.

The method adopted was Bessel's, as modified by Arthur von ffittingen (' Ueber

die Correction der Thermometer,' A. von Qittingen. Dorpat, 1865.)

In this there appear to be two weali points, viz., (1) the concentration of the

observations on the central part of the scale, (2) the uncertainty as to the best

method of uniting the two curves obtained respectively from the ' Ilauptpunkte,'

mand the other points at which observations are made. These were    part

strengthened by introducing the additional measures (used by Arthur von CEttingen

in the second approximation only) in the first approximation and by giving to the

' Hauptpunkte ' a higher relative value than is assigned to them by von CEttingen.

Under these conditions the method, though very laborious, is capable of giving

excellent results.
TRANSACTIONS OF SKCTION A.                                         541

     Thus in the case of six thermometers, on three of which the measurements
necessary for the calibrations were made at Kew, and on three at the Owens Oolle"-e,
by Messrs. G. Baker and M. Ilirakoa respectively, the difference between any o'lie
measurement of the length of a mercurial thread expressed in terms of the corrected
scale and the mean length of that thread equals or exceeds 0'01°C. (i.e. about 0"1 m.m.)
in eleven only out of a total of b80 measurements.

    The Kew thermometers had been calibrated, as is usual at that observatory, by

Welsh's methodCRep. Brit. Ass.,' 1853, p. 34). Mr. G. Baker afterwards made,

in accordance with the author's instructions, the measurements necessary for the
application of Bessel's method, the calculation being undertaken by the authors.

     It was a matter of some interest to determine in this case the magnitude of the

errors of the original calibration.

     Welsh's method is undoubtedly open to the objection that the errors are addi-

tive and Von QSttingen (foe. cj;!. p. 49) seems to consider that it must always be

necessary, for accurate work, to correct further a thermometer calibrated by it.
     The three thermometers were numbered 561-2-3, they read from 11 -.5° to 29° 0.

from 19-5° to 68°, and from 51° to 107° respectively. The average lengths of a
degree were 12-9 m.m., 11'2 m.m., and 9-5 m.m. respectively. The application of
Bessel's method to the first was made by 1 10 measurements of the mercurial threads

to the second by 163, and to the third by 185.

     The original calibration was so accurate that the second approximation of
Bessel's method was unnecessary in two cases, and was only partly carried out in
the third.

The maximum positive and negative corrections were in the case of

Th. 561 + 0-004° 0. and - 0-004° C.

,, 562 +0-012°  ,, -0-005°

,, 663 +0-008° ,, -0-Oir

     As will be seen from the above description of the thermometers, the larger of

these quantities are about equal to the limit of certainty in readino-.

     In no case would the calibration error in the determination of a difference of
temperature have amounted to 0-02° C. It may therefore be concluded that Welsh's

method, as applied at Kew to selected tubes, and with a measuring instrument of

:great accuracy, is capable of giving first- rate results. The errors which remain
when it has been applied are so small that they may be neglected in all cases
but those where the thermometers are to be used under the most favourable con-
ditions, i.e. with the stem at the same temperature as the bulb, &c.

     This satisfactory conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Professor Rowland

has recently stated that the calibration of the Kew thermometer used by him in his

research on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat was practically perfect.

  8. On the General Coincidence between Sun-spot Activity and Terrestrial
          Magnetic Disturbance. By the Rev. F. Howlett, F.B.A.8.

    The object of this paper was to inquire how far solar activity, more especially

as regards sun-spots, is wont to be accompanied by terrestrial magnetic disturbances

;a8 recorded by the automatic magnetic declination cui-ves at Kew and Greenwich,

     The data for such an investigation were furnished by comparisons instituted
between the more striking instances of sun-spots gathered out of a long series of
solar observations carried on by Mr. Howlett from 1850 to the present epoch, and
the synchronous conditions of the magnetic curves at the observatories above men-
tioned. The telescopic drawings of the spots were obtained with an achromatic of
three inches' aperture, by Dollond, and of forty-eight _' 2hes' focal distance, project-
ing the sun's image on a large white screen in a darkened chamber.

    By employing a Huygenian eyepiece magnifying 120 linear, and placing the

screen at the distance of five feet, two inches from the eyepiece, a beautiful image
of the sun was obtained, five feet four inches in diameter, and of which every inch
corresponded to just 30" of the celestial arc.

     Not only were the measurements of all the solar phenomena rendered thereby
                                                                                --

exceedingly easy, but the conditions of amplification, illumination, and definition

of details were combined in about the best possible manner for the observer's

Eurpose, which was to maintain an accurate record of the solar spots, and very
  requently of the faculse also, on a large scale ; these have been collected into five

volumes, and presented to the Royal Astronomical Society.

The comparisons commence with the very remarkable and cyclonic group of

August and September, 1859, which was uniquely distinguished (so far as observa-

tions have hitherto gone) by the remarkable outbiu'st of intense white light, far

brighter than the photosphere itself, which fortunately was witnessed on the fore-

noon of September 1, by the late Messrs. Carrington and Hodgson, but which ]\Ir.

Howlett missed seeing by only a few minutes, ha\dng completed his drawings, and

so left the telescope.

    Other striking and, if they may be so termed, crucial groups, were compared

--with the magnetic records very notably the great spot of October, 1865, en-

gi'avings of which may be found in the volume of the ' Proceedings of the Royal

Astronomical Society ' for the year last mentioned ; as also the prodigious groups of

February, 1870, which were observed and drawn on the occasion of their reappear-

ance, by revolution, in the three consecutive months of February, March, and April

of that year ; and on the last of which months the total displacement, at one and the

--same time, of the solar photosphere or, in other words, the total area occupied by
--the sun-spots was no less than 5,000,200,000,000 square mUes, or about twenty-

seven times that of the superficies of the earth !

So again, in August and September, 1870, immense groups, occupying from

4,000,000,000 to 5,000,000,000 square miles, were observed to make two consecutive

--revolutions [on the latter of which two occasions a beautifully enlarged photo-

graph of the sun, twenty-four inches in diameter, was made by Mr. Titterton, of Ely,

under the auspices of the late Canon Sehvyn, and was exhibited to Section A.]

On all these occasions great magnetic disturbances, amounting often to absolute

magnetic storms, were unequivocally manifested ; and, in fact, out of twenty-four

comparisons instituted, the following is the summary of results ; as showing the

coincidence of extensive solar activity and synchronous magnetic disturbance :

     Thus, then, from the data collected, it would certainly appear that, not only on
the occasion of large groups of spots occurring at the periods of maximum, but also
often on the occasion of any other marked outbursts of spots, there will generally
be found to be a corresponding amount of terrestrial magnetic distvu-bance. But
still, from an impartial and careful comparison of the data appealed to, it is clear that
the magnetic disturbances were manifested in a variety of ways, not only as regards

--the extent for instance, of the excursions of the needle, the rapidity of the oscilla-
--tions, or the persistency of the more moderate disturbances, but also the varying

intervals of time at which the disturbances take place, after the commencement of

the observed solar outbursts.

    KewWith respect, lastly, to other reactionary influences, the Director of the

Observatory states that, on the occasion of the perihelion passage of the Comet b,.
1881, on the 16th day of June last, the terrestrial magnetic curves were unusually

quiescent.

11. On a netv Integrating Anemometer, By the Rev. J. M. Wilson, M.A.,
                                  and H. S. Hele Shaw.

     The primary object of this instrument is to obtain a record of the total trans-

ference of air over any given spot, in order to be able to arrive at a determination of

the circulation of air on the globe, in a similar way to that in which the circulation
of the water is known to take place. Few results would be so interesting as
a map of the world showing the simultaneously existing air-currents, so as to enable

the average circulation of the whole to be seen at a glance. The existing anemome-

ters only give the resultant after considerable labour in calculation, by takino'

periods, first by resolving the various com-

ponents, then summing and recombining

them. The tedious and inacciu-ate nature

of this process is obvious. JNIr. Wilson,

therefore, conceived the idea of having a

pencil moved over a board in the direction

of, and with a velocity proportional to that

of, the wind, and submitted a sketch of a

plan based upon this idea to Mr. Shaw,

who has undertaken the complete design

and superintended the construction of the

first instrument, which, however, must be

considered rather in the light of an experi-

mental one. The ordinary cup-anemometer

of Robinson is xised to drive a train of wheels

by means of a central spindle on which is

--a worm and thus iiltimately to turn, at a

much reduced speed, a serrated roller, which

gives motion to a horizontal table, and on

this is laid the sheet of paper. The plane

of rotation of the roller is always kept co-

incident with the direction of the wind, by

having its bearings in a hollow rod which

contains the central one, and which only

turns as the wind changes its direction

thus the curve is identical in direction with

the wind. The board and paper are pro-

tected by a sloping wooden roof, which

supports a pillar five feet high, carrying

the cups and direction-vanes. The original

plaa was to have the board, which is two

feet square, moving on truly spherical steel

balls, upon a marble slab four feet square.         Integrating Anemometer.

lower, and the lower on the marble, kept parallel by having rollers running in the

frame which supports the roof. By this means a movement can be obtained in any

direction whatever without anj' rotation being able to take place, and the results

obtained during the few days in \\hich the instrument in its completed form has

been at work are very satisfactory. Fig. 2 shows the curves obtained from August

·"lO to September -3, combined so as to give at a glance the direction and volume of

wind passing over University College, Bristol, during that time. The trace of the

pretend to great accuracy, it shows clearly how the wind veered from the N.E. to

the N.W., and the only alterations that are required are in matters of detail.

   Mr. Shaw proposes to apply clockwork in a very inexpensive way, so as to cause

marks to he made along the curve at regular intervals of time, and by the intro-

duction of this element, it is evident that the                                                           Fig.

     The author directs attention to a development of the planetary hypothesis of
solar distm-bance. The tidal disturbing effect of the planets on the sun, acting at
their mean distances, will be in accordance with the following order : Jupiter
Venus, Mercury, Earth, Saturn, Mars, Uranus, Neptune. The first four of these

are the most influential, and offer six combinations in pairs. Any one of these pah-s
may be taken with a third planet. Taking Jupiter as the third planet, the author

considered the combination involving Venus and the Earth, and gave some of the
results already obtained, but reserved the remaining combinations for notice on a

future occasion.

                            By Thomas' Fairley, F.B.S.E.

     In 1878, Mr. Hutton of Solberge, near Northallerton (.3^ miles S.), informed

me of a remarkable outflow of gas from a well situated on his estate near his

Aresidence. This current was observed while the barometer was fallino-.

chemical analysis of this gas showed it to be common air containing 20-9 per cent.
       TIUNSACTIONS OF SKCTION A.  545

of oxygen. Conceiving that tliere must he a large underground cavity com-
 municating with the shaft of the well, T thought the phenomena worthy of
investigation, and through Mr. Ilutton's kindness and assistance 1 was able to
 make these experiments.

      The out-currents were very powerful and attracted the attention of everyone in
 the neighbourhood, and equally powerful in-currents were observed during the
 periods of a rising barometer. On descending the shaft of the well 15 yards, the

 fissures in the sandstone were observed where these currents passed. Analyses
 were made of the sandstone and the water in the well. I then attempted, by
 careful readings of the barometer at Solberge, and measurement of the currents, to
 obtain, by the application of Boyle's law, the approximate volume of the cavity.
The readings of the instruments were made by Mr. Hutton.

      Experiments were made, first with a Biram's vane anemometer ; afterwards
 with very large dry gas-meters. Only those observations could be used where the
 barometric change continued so long that the current produced had time to
 exhaust itself. The temperatures of the out-currents and of the air were also
 noted. In cold weather the out-current was warmer than the outside air.

     The anemometer observations were made in July and in December 1879. Of
these, two sets of observations made in July, and two made in December, give an

 average result of 10-.3 millions of cubic feet as the approximate volume of the

cavity.

     The dry gas-meter observations were made in March and April 1880, with

two meter.s kindly lent by Messrs. Glover & Son, of London, capable of passing

about 3,00.0 cubic feet per hour.' Even this capacity was insufficient, and
the experiments were stopped by the meters being thrown out of gear hj the force
and rapidity of the current. One set of observations were, however, tolerably
perfect and complete, and give a capacity of ten millions of cubic feet very nearly.
These volumes correspond to a cubic space of about 217 feet.

      Caverns are generally found in limestone rocks. Geologists consider that the

magnesian limestone would be here about 400 feet below the surface. The
nearest exposed section is, however, at some distance.

     Another blowing well is located at Langton Hall, 5 miles N.W. from Soll^erge,

both being located on the rising groimd separating the valleys of the rivers Wi,ske

and Swale. In this case also the currents consist of air, and their direction and

volume depend on the changes of the barometer.

     Of course the measurements mentioned above cannot give more than a minimum
Tolume for the cavity, if there are any other openings.

     The third blowing well I have not yet visited. It is situated on the estate of
Mr. Paver Crow at Ornhams, 2 miles south from Boroughbridge. I have analysed
the water, which is somewhat similar to that of the water at Solberge. The

·>current8 here are very powerful, causing a rushing noise in passing through the

ifissures.

      In all these cases the currents are extremely sensitive to the chajges of the
barometer. I have examined and inquired about other wells in the district, but

these are the only blowing weUs I have found. Other wells near Solberge, within
a mile of the blowing well, gave no currents.

    By Fred. W. Brearey, Hon. Secretary of the Aeronautical Society.

 - The author examined the various fallacies which have been entertained in
ancient and modern times with respect to the flight of birds, and explained some
of his own experiments during the last six years. With respect to the hollow
bones of birds, and the opinion of many that such an arrangement is intended as a
receptacle for a rarefied gas, he quoted a remark by the author of a paper read by
a member of the Aeronautical Society, that if the whole body of the bird were
filled with the lightest gas or even so much vacuous space, the supporting effect

' They were coupled, so that one registered the ii>, the other the out-current

would be of the slightest value ; for supposing that a bird of 2 lbs. weight
displaces ^- of a cubic foot of air, or about 46 grains in weight onlj', the buoyancy
imparted to it would really amount to but 3 of 1 per cent, of the weight of the
bird. Besides which the force imparted to the wing of the bird is due to its
weight only, and were it as light as an equal bulk of air it could not fly at all.
The author next alluded to the upward stroke of the wing, and the theory that
in it the feathers separate so as to allow of the air passing through. There is
really no necessity for such action, because although the wing be rising in order
to repeat the downward stroke, it is all the time pressing against the air with the-
whole weight of the bird's body, and in that act of rising the wing has also a

propelling effect.

    He then proceeds to argue that the weight of the bird plays an active part in

its flight, and that this result arises from the action of that portion of the pectoral
muscle wliich depresses the wing. So great is the tension of this muscle that it
is highly probable that, in the case of those long-winged and heavy birds which are
able to fly without apparently moving a feather, the wings are kept extended
against tlie resistance of the air underneath without any voluntary effort of the-
bird. Its weight pressing upon the air causes this muscle to expand in raising
the wing, and aids in the effect of the downward stroke by its contraction.
The author exhibited a model with -wangs 4 feet from tip to tip and 3 feet 2 inches
from head to tail. The wings are actuated by M. Renaud's plan of strands of india-
rubber previously put into a state of tension, which in unwinding create a flap-

ping of the wings. By an india-rubber cord attached to the under part of the
wing and passing under the shaft to whicli the mechanism is attached, an equi-
librium between the two forces is attained : that is to say, the india-rubber strands
are wound up to that extent that the wings in rising stretch the india-rubber

-- --cord or, as the author calls it, the pectoral cord until one force neutralises the

other : so that, held in the hand, there is no action. When liberated, and com-

mitted to the pressure of the nir underneath the wings, the weight of the model
causes the wings to be elevated, and therefore stretches the pectoral cord, which
in its contraction assists the power derived from the twisted rubber in depressing-
the wings arainst the weight of the model. During this action the flight is
 deliberate and well-sustained for 40 feet or more.

      As, over and above this condition of equilibriimi, there is plenty of reserve-
power, the flight of the model is capable of great extension.

      The author argues from this that the power required to produce flight has

been much exaggerated, and that weight is an absolute necessity. He show^s

 various forms of flight, but he believes that there can be nothing superior to the-

Teciprocating wing-action which propels and supports at the same time. He re-

 commends, however, trial of an apparatus which, from his experiments, promises
 success. Is it pos.sible, he asks, to control some arrangement in the nature of a

--parachute by altering its form and making it longitudinal giving it, in fact, a

 head and a tail. Such an apparatus, made by himself, was liberated from a balloon-
 which rose from Woolwich Arsenal, and it travelled back, by the aid of gravity

--alone, to the Arsenal--of course against the breeze which wafted away the balloon
      a distance of half a mile.
     He argues from this that if the fabric can be manipulated so that propulsion-

 also can be imparted to it, then some encouraging results would be likely to

 follow. He showed a model of large size upon this principle, and how, by the-

 action of the wing-arms, a wave is transmitted from head to tail along a loose

 surface in shape like a kite. This loose surface necessarily requires a fall before it

 can be inflated by the air underneath. The wave-motion is then found adequate

 to its propulsion. An estimate of the power required to propel and support

 100 lbs. weight in the air has been made from the data given from this model,
 which weighs with added lead 2i lbs., and it is believed that ^ h.p. will be required
 for each 100 lbs.

      Having arranged about 300 square feet of a suitable fabric, the author pro-
 poses that, to effect a start, the apparatus, having a flat-bottomed carriage, shall be-
 placed upon a wheeled platform or truck, the two front being higher than the
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                      547

hind wheels, so that upon running down the side of a hill upon a tramway the

apparatus shall preserve a horizontal position. That, being weighted to ascertain
the balance, which can only be effected by repeated trial, the truck be liberated.

--The effect will be to inflate the fabric into a parachute to elevate the wing-arms

and stretch the pectoral cord, and if properly balanced the machine will descend

safely in the direction of its head.

    If it be found that a weight equal to that of a man can be brought to the
ground safely, then might come the manual test, and his capacity to depress the

wing-arms so as to keep up an undulation.

3. On the Extension of the Theory of Screws to the Dynamics of any ma-
    terial system. By Robert S. Ball, LL.D., F.B.8., Royal Astronomer-

of Ireland.

   A mechanical system of any number of rigid pieces, anyhow connected, is dis-

placed to an indefinitely close position. This displacement could have^een pro-

duced by giving to each piece a twist of definite amplitude about a given screw.

We thus have a series of pi-imary screws equal in number to the pieces of the

system. If the twists on any two consecutive screws be compounded they will
form a twist on a third screw, which we may speak of as being inter^nediate. The
whole series of screws primary and intermediate is called a screw-chain and, com-

bined with a single amplitude or metric element, expresses a displacement of

the system.

If the system have but one degree of freedom, then the only possible movements

are those of twisting on one screw-chain. If the system be capable of displace-

ment about a second screw-chain it must necessarily be capable of displacement

about a singly infinite number of other chains, which can be simply constructed,

when a third chain has been found. The result of the first twist and the second

Wetwist could have been directly obtained by a third twist.  thus have three

screws corresponding to each element. These sets of three are each co-cylindroidal.

We thus have a number of cylindroids equal to the number of elements of the

system. To find another screw-chain about which the system can twist, select any

screw on one of the cylindroids, and a homographic screw on each of the others
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

this will give the primary screws. Each set of three intermediate screws are also

co-cylindroidal, and the required intermediate screws are also a homographic

system,

      lu the case of a system capable of twisting alx)ut three arbitrary screw-chains,

it can be shown that the determination of subsequent chains can be obtained by
the aid of point homogi-aphies in planes. With freedom of the fourth order the
point homographies of spaces may be used. For liigher orders of freedom concep-

tions analogous to those of 'Parallel Projections' in statics are available.

548 REPORT-- 1881.

     The most general set of forces acting upon a system can also be represented by
a series of wrenches on the screws of a screw-chain. The screw-chain is thus
symmetrically related to the most general group of forces and to the most general
form of displacement.

     The theory is extensive, but one illustration may be given. If the forces

act impulsively, the system commences to twist about an instantaneous screw-
chain. Generally the impulsive screw-cliain and the instantaneous .screw-chain are
diiferent. It will, however, sometimes happen that the two coincide. The number
of cases where this occurs is equal to the number of degrees of freedom which the
system posses.ses.

sin u, cos u, "tan n, cot u, sec tt, cosec ti, of which two are even and four are uneven.

These six functions are divisible into three pairs, sin u and cos u, tan u and cos ti,

sec M and cosec u, which are such that if we select from them any triad, one being
taken from each pair, the other three functions may be derived from them by a
change in the argument, that is by the substitution of ^tt + m for u. The num-

ber of such triads is eight, the total number of triads that can be formed from the

six functions being twenty.

is even ; and that the twelve formula of reduction are similar in form and such
that from any one of them the other eleven may be deduced.*

3. On the Rainfall Observations made upon York Minster by Prof.
            John Phillips, F.R.S. By G. J. Stmons, F.R.S.

     The author commenced by noticing the experiments on rainfall made by ]Mi'.
Townley and by Dr. Ileberden at Westminster in 1766, and elsewhere. Those by
Prof. Phillips and Mr. Gray were made during the years 1832-5, when gauges were
set up at York, with the following results :

MuseUm garden, 2 inches above ground. Total rain 21 'SI in.    Patio 100.
                                                                   ,, ftO.
     ,, roof, 44 feet     ,,,,,,,,                   17'39 ,,     ,, 60.
Minster Tower, 213 feet   ,,,,,,,,                   12-99 ,,

Which totals agree very well with Dr. Heberden's observations. Prof. Phillips' ex-

planation of the above was that the drops of rain increased in volume on their

·descent through the moist lower strata of the atmosphere. The author remarked

upon certain considerations which liad been omitted by Prof. Phillips, such as the

velocity of tlie wind and the fact that seasons which are ^^'indy are also cold and

--humid and to Prof. Bache's report, presented to the British Association in 1838,

in which he called attention to the important effect of eddy winds on the phe-

nomena. He found that, of gauges mounted upon a lofty tower, those to leeward

Aof the wind received the most water.  great alteration was made by elevating

the gauge on a pole ; thus, when those at the N.E. and S. W. angles received water in

the proportion of 1 to 1'68, those elevated 6 feet above the parapet received it in

the proportion of 1 to 1-08, and with a more moderate wind the quantities were yet

nearer equality. Sir John Herschel also has shown that any sensible addition to

the volume of a drop of rain in the way supposed would very materially raise its
temperature. The author then adverted to Mr. W. S. Jevons' paper, published in

the 'Philosophical Magazine' for Dec. 1861, in which he shows that the phenomena

observed are all consistent ^\^th the theory that the fall of rain is practically identi-

cal at all elevations, while the observed differences are due to imperfect collection

by the gauges, owing to deflection of the rain-bearing current by such obstacles as

houses, towers, and even the gauges themselves. Mr. Dines (without knowledge

of the last paper) came to a similar conclusion, as stated to the British Association

in 1877, and this had subsequently been confirmed by observations on large surfaces,

such as the roof of Messrs. Marshall's factory at Leeds, and upon one 5,000 square

feet in area in survey. In the latter case (the height above the gi-ound being 29

feet) the difference between the rainfall on the two localities was only 2 per cent.

instead of 20 per cent., as woidd be the case on the roof of a small building or near

the edge of a large one.

4. On Volta-Elecfric Inversion. Bi/ Professor Silvanus P. Thompson,

                                                          b.aI, D.Sc.

The author gives the name of volta-electric invergion to a phenomenon which is,,

for voltaic currents, the precise analogue of the thermo-electric inversion discovered

by Gumming- in the case of thermo-electric currents.

It is known that when voltaic cells are heated both their resistance and their

E.M.F. are afiected. The latter sometimes increases, sometimes diminishes. The

latter phenomenon led the author to suspect the existence of a volta-electric inver--

sion. This he discovered as occurring in a cell containing sulphuric acid of density

1"753, into whicli dipped electrodes of iron and copper. At 25° C. this cell gave

a current which flowed through the liquid from iron to copper, the iron dissolving

in the acid, with evolution of hydrogen at the copper pole. On heating the cell the

current fell oft^ and became null between 140° and 150°, when it recommenced

powerfidly in the inverse direction, bubbles believed to be SO.j coming oft" from the

miron pole, the copper pole dissolving the acid. The currents in question were

true voltaic currents, being of much greater E.M.F. than the thermo-currentsof an

iron-copper pair, and being moreover accompanied by strong cliemical action in

the cell. The author cited as explanatory of this eftect some experiments of War-

burg on the electrolysis of strong sulphuric acid, whicli when electrolysed below

H80° C. yielded only and gases ; between 80° and 90° gave O at anode and at

kathode II    and S                                 Init  above 90° gave O at  anode, S  only  at  kathode.  It was
                                                 ;

fiu'ther pointed out that this discovery rendered possible a battery of two metals

and one liquid, from which a constant current could be obtained without contact

of dissimilar metals, alternate cells in the series being heated ; and the copper of

one cell should be joined to the copper of the next, and the iron of this to the iron-

of the next.

6. On the Eotational Coefficient in Variotis Metals. By E. H. Hall.

    This communication treated of the recently discovered fact that when a con-
ductor bearing an electric current is acted upon by a magnetic force at right angles
to the ciurent, an electro-motive force is set up in the conductor, the direction of
this force being perpendicidar to the plane of the electric current and the magnetic

force.

     Several articles upon the subject have already been published, but the present

communication made known a few new facts not yet in print which had been

ascertained quite recently during the author's short stay in the laboratory of Prof.

Helmholtz in Berlin.

The numerical -n alues given in the table below are in any case only tentative,,

and those which are marked thus (?) are particularly uncertain, being liable to

errors of perhaps 100 per cent, or more. It is believed, however, that in every

case the sign fixed to any number is correct.

Arranging the metals thus far examined in the order of magnitude of the trans-

vei-se effect in them, we obtain the following table.

The numbers given are intended to be p}-0]}ort.ional only to the magnitude of the-

transverse effect, and not to have any absolute significance.

6. On a Dynamometer Coupling. By Professors W. E. Ateton, F.B.8.,

                                   and John Peery, B.E.

The instrument exhibited to the Section is one of a complete set of instruments

designed by the author for measuring purposes in electric lighting, and in the trans-

-- Amission of power. The other instruments belonging to the set are 1st. dead-beat

Galvanometer or Am-7neter, which measures accurately a strong electric current

in amperes. It gives an immediate measurement of a rapid alteration in the

current                                when wound  somewhat  differently, this becomes the author's  Volt-meter,
                                    ;

Awhich measures instantaneously an electromotive force in volts. 2nd. rhotometer,

which ogives the strength of a light in standard candles, and which enables the

measuring operation to be performed in a veiy small room. 3rd. An Ergo-

meter, which gives at one reading the horse-power which is being expended

pn an electric arc or in an incandescent lamp, or in any other electric circuit. That

is, it gives in one reading the product of electro-motive force into current. The

authors have called the instrument a Power-meter, but Sir William Thomson has

given te it the name Ergometer. 4th. The present instrument; a Dynamo-

meter, which measures the horse-powei- transmitted from one length of shafting

to another in a factor^-, or the power given up to any machine.

     Various dynamometers, as is well known, are in existence, but however suited

they may be to laboratory conditions, they cannot be regarded as suitable for

workshop use. In fact, they are to be called arrangements of scientific apparatus

rather than dynamometers. The dynamometer described by the authors in their

paper read before the Society of Telegraph Engineers last session may be seen in

use by the students of The City and Guilds of London Technical CoUege at
Fmsbury. It is capable of more general application than this, because it is used

in the belting which drives a dynamo or any other machine. Although the

principle of construction of this instrument is the same, they think it worthy of

notice from its being capable of taking the place of an ordinary shaft coupling,
and froni its not being much more expensive than an ordinary shaft coupling.
In fact, it consists of the two halves of an ordinary coupling, onekeyed to each of

the shafts which are to be coupled. The shape is slightly different from what is
usual, and allows the connection of the two halves by means of the spiral springs.

Now it is evident that if one shaft turns the other, it can only do so by pulling

the springs, and the movement of the turning couple is proportional to the

lengthening of the springs, that is, to the angidar advance of one half of the

coupling before the other half. Here are two light levers, by means of which this

relative motion of the two halves produces a radial motion of a silvered bead,
and the distance of this bead radially from the shaft, can be read off on a scale.
The scale reading, midtiplied into the number of revolutions per minute, gives at

once the horse-power transmitted through the coupling. The whole arrangement
would appear to be nearly as small and insignificant as an ordinary coupling were

it not for the disc of sheet iron, with its marginal flange, which is used to protect

the levers and the bead. Everytliing except the bead is painted dead-black. The
instrument exhibited has been designed to couple a Brotherhood Engine and a
Brush Machine, and w^hen the bead is close to the sliaft and the speed is 800

revolutions per minute, tlie coupling transmits 18 horse-power. In the present

position of the bead the springs are unstrained, and tliis is the case when no
power IS being tran.smitted. It is the authors' intention to attempt to introduce these

couplings into every line of shafting in manufactories, so that the stream of power

along every shaft may be measured and visibly made known at any distance from
which tlie bead may be distinguished.

     li (f> = const, aud yfr = const, be the equations to the curves of equal velocity-
potential and to the stream-lines in the case of a liquid possessed of irrotational
motion in two dimensions, let us, in accordance with a well-known property
of these functions, assume

Hence, at an infinite distance from the origin, all the stream-lines are parallel to the
axis of X, and that axis, together with the two circles whose equations are given
above, constitutes a stream-line.

     The equations thus solve the problem of the flow of a liqiud past a cylindrical
obstacle, the generating lines of which are perpendicular to the undisturbed direc-
tion of the flow of the liquid, and the boundary of which is such that a section at
right angles to the generating lines is made up of the external portions of the
circumferences of two equal circles which pass through each other's centres, the

line of centres being perpendicular to the undisturbed lines of flow.

    The expression for may conveniently be written in the form
                                                                                      <f)

where r and r' are the distances from the centres of the two circles.
     The above formulae may also be arrived at from elementary considerations, and

they have been tested, as applied to the electric current, in the Physical Laboratory
of the Yorkshire College. The apparatus used was similar to that described by
Prof G. C. Foster and Dr. Lodge in the 'Proc. Phys. Soc.,' part iii., 1875, except in
so far as brass bars were used as linear electrodes.

    When the apparatus was adjusted so that the eqmpotential lines were, as

nearly as possible, parallel to these bars, a portion of the tinfoil was i-emoved,
and the form of the disturbed lines determined.

    At first, to test the accuracy of the method, some experiments were made when

the part removed was circular. Afterwards the two equal circles were cut out.

    Some specimen results are given below. As it was difiicidt to make the equi-

potential lines exactly parallel to the bars in the first instance, points on the same

disturbed equipotential line were measured at approximately equal distances from

                                                                                           I

difference in tlieir capillary relations. In investigating this action I used a capillary

tube in which was a thread of mercury broken by an air-bubble, and by causing
this to run, I found that oxidation took place at the concave surface of tiie retreat-
ing coluuin and rendered it negative to the advancing convex siu-face. I thus,
obtained as much as -70 as the difference in potential (by increasing the number of
bubbles), while in tlie case of the falling drops a deflection indicating from -50 to
·6D existed. The connection between this and oxidation was rendered evident by
the possibility of increasing the deflection obtained by more rapid oxidation, and
of reversing it by substituting for air a reducing gas, "while if both funnel and jet
were in an inert medium the absence of deflection would prove the second point:
metals, when touching, are at the same potential.

11. On the Electric Discharge through Colza Oil}

    Bij A. Macfarlane, M.A., D.Sc, F.E.S.E.

     The electrical properties of colza oil examined were its dielectric strength and
some phenomena accompanying the passage of the spark. By the dielectric
strength of a substance is meant the ratio of the difference of potential required

to pass a spark through the substance to that required to pass a spark through'
air under the same conditions. One set of observations gave 2-7 as the value for

colza oil ; another gave 2-5. The values now obtained for liquids are exhibited in

the following table :

        Substance     Dielectric strength
Paraffin oil                    3-7

Oil of turpentine               4-0
Paraffin (liquefied)            2-4
Olive oil                       3-5
Colza oil                       2'6

     The passage of the spark was accompanied by the formation of gas-bubbles, but
there was no deposition of solid particles. The behaviour of these bubbles was
such as to indicate that they were formed at the positive electrode, and that they
were positively electrified.

     The method of the investigation is that described in ' Trans. R. S. E.,' vol.

   13. On an Easy Method of makinq Carbon Cells for Galvanic Batteries.
                                 By W. Symons, F.G.S.

   At tlie Belfast meeting of the Association the author described a method of

   making carbon cells by repeatedly dipping paper moulds in a mixture of syrup and

   Aline carbon. This is a practicable but tedious process.  much easier and more
   --expeditious method is the following : Mix together 15 parts of powdered gas

   cai-bon, 3 parts of v^ood charcoal, and 10 parts of lump sugar. Well shake down

   this powder, dry into paper moulds of the size and shape required, cylindrical

   being the most manageable. Bury the iilled moulds in sand in a suitable iron or

   copper vessel, and gradually expose to a red heat. When cold remove the burnt

   paper from the now solid cells, and soak them in a syrup made of equal parts of

   lump sugar and water. Well dry the cells, wrap them up in paper, again bury in

   sand, and gi'adually expose them for some time to as strong a heat as practicable,

   but not less than a bright red heat. For this purpose the author has used an

   extempore furnace made of Fletcher's solid-flame burner, surmounted with a com-

   mon unglazed earthenware drain-pipe, partially closed with an iron dome. This

   furnace is easily constructed, and is useful for a variety of purposes. The draught may

   -of course be increased hj adding a pipe to the iron dome. In the author's expe-

   rience a carbon mixture of the above proportions is the best. Cells made with

   other kinds of carbon crack more or less, but the above mixture, with due care, does

   not crack.

              14. On an Antimonized Cellular Garhon Galvanic Battery.
                                   By W. Symons, F.G.S.

         Faraday, in his ' Experimental Researches,' p. 2012, 'On the Order of the Metallic
   Elements of Voltaic Circles,' places antimony highest of the metals tested by him
   -with hydrochloric acid. This fact suggested to the author the construction of a bat-
   tery made with carbon cells as described in the previous paper, with antimony
   precipitated on the carbon, using zinc rods unamalgamated and a solution of

   ammonium chloride, but, with very limited leisure, he has not been able to complete

   an efficient battery in time for this meeting. He, however, ventures to suggest
   such a battery as a useful one for general laboratory purposes, being somewhat
   .similar to Smee's in action, but with much cheaper negative elements, and a more

   economical utilization of the zinc. By boring holes also in the carbons, he believes

   that polarisation will be diminished, by thus increasing the amount of efficient
   ·carbon surface and promoting the circulation of the liqidd, but at present he has
   not had time to test this point. The carbon cells can be made small enough to be
   nearly close to the zinc, while, by having the containing vessels of an ample size,
   the constancy of the current will be enhanced. Another form of the battery
   which he proposes to make is with larger carbons and porous diaphragms, using

   for the outer liquid a mixture of antimonious chloride and ammonium cliloride.
        Perhaps it may not be amiss to add that plaster of Paris diaphragms can also

   be easily made with dry plaster. Provide an inner core or mould of turned wood,
   a little taper and with a shoulder the required thickness of the diaphragm ; round
   this tie two thicknesses of stout blotting-paper, well shake down the dry plaster
   ·between the wooden core and the paper. Then immerse the whole in water. In a
   few minutes the diaphragm will be solid and can be removed from the mould.

15. On the Absolute Sine Electrometer. By Professor G. M. Minchin, M.A.

     This is an electrometer in which use is made of the attracted disk and guard-

plate principle.

     The continuous plate and the guard plate are two brass plates, each about a
foot square, ihey are kept at a constant small distance apart (being parallel to
each other) by means of four ivory axes or pins driven through them near their
corners. The attracted disc is a square of aluminium, its side being 3 centimetres
lono- · it is suspended by means of two ^^ ollaston platinum wires, each about
7 inches long, from a metallic piece at the top edge of the guard plate. The two
plates can move, as a rigid body, round a fixed horizontal axis attached to the
continuous plate. This system can be tilted out of the vertical position by means
of a micrometer screw wliose axis works horizontally against the lower portion of

the continuous plate.

     The disk (which is, of course, always in metallic contact with the guard plate)
is, in the vertical position of the plates, flush with the guard plate. This flush-
ness is obtained by means of four small adjustable screws fixed to the guard plate
at the back of the disk ; when the system of plates is tilted out of the vertical,
the disk will remain in the flush position, unless it is attracted ofi" the points of
these four screws by some force.

    Any motion of the disk is observed by means of a microscope rigidly attached

to the back of the guard plate ; the focal length is :^inch.
      If the continuous plate is connected by a wire with one electrified body, while

the disk and guard plate are connected with another, the disk will be drawn ofT

the screw-points, unless the system of plates is sufficiently tilted out of the

 vertical.

     If M' = weight of disk, ^ = angle of deviation of plates from vertical, rf = distance

between the Eplates, = difference of potential of the sources in connection with

the two plates, S = area of disk, the equation of equilibrium of the disk when it is

just out of contact with the screws is

         = w sin 6.

   OTra"

  --The force measured is thus proportional to the sine of the angle of deflection

from the vertical whence the name of the instrument.
     Usually the sine and the circular measure will be equal, since the deflections

will not amount to many degrees.
     In the instrument (which has been constructed by Mr. Groves of Bolsover

Street) d^'^lQ millimetres, w = -2568 grammes, the vertical distance between the

axis of suspension of the plates and the point of the tilting micrometer screw = 15

inches, the diameter of the head of this screw is 3 inches, its circumference is
divided into 1 ,000 equal parts, and the pitch is 55-inch. Hence the equation of
equilibrium (employing the absolute measures of weight and length) is

                                     E = -0456v/m,

where wt is the number of divisions turned through on the micrometer screw-head

from the vertical position of the plates.

Since it is diflacult to know when the vertical position is attained exactly, a

Andiff"erential method is resorted to.     observation is made with n cells and then

with n' of the same cells, and if, when the disc is just attracted off' the screws, the

readings of the micrometer screw-head are «i and 7n', we get

E  =  .045,6.,/                            m -- 711'

m mwhere, of course, -- in' is known, although and m' are separately unknown.

     There are four adjustments which must be carefully attended to, the most

diihcult being the determination of the distance d. This (on the suggestion of
Professor Carey Foster) was determined by taking thiee readings with a sphero-
meter at three points of the aperture of the guard plate, before and after the inser-
tion of mica washers on the four ivory axes which connect the plates.

           A4. Contribution to the History of the Algebra of Logic.

                              By the Rev. R. Harlet, F.B.8.

     The author pointed out that the earlier and limited conceptions of algebra, that

it is a universal arithmetic, or such a modification of arithmetic as is necessitated
by the use of a symbolical language, had prevented for long the connection between
the fundamental principles and processes of algebra and of logic from being dis-»

covered. To perceive that algebra embraces not only arithmetic in its widest
sense, but the whole science of symbolical reasoning, formed a most important step
in logic as well as in mathematics. This was first apprehended to some extent by
certain of the more philosophical analysts of the earlier part of the present cen-
tury, and was more clearly enumerated by Dr. F. Gregory in 1838. Henceforward,
as arithmetic had proved the ' science of suggestion 'to algebra, so the latter, in the
hands of Boole, proved the science of suggestion to logic. In his works, ' The
Mrtthematical Analysis of Logic,' and, more fully and systematically, in his ' Laws
of Thought,' he developed the science of logic in algebraical forms. This mode of

expression is justified on strictly logical grounds. It is founded, not upon any sup-
posed relationship or analogy between the conceptions or ideas with which lof^icians
anil mathematicians are respectively conversant, but upon the fact, established by
actual examination, that the formal laws of thought in logic are identical with those
of an algebra, or science of number, in which the symbols represent, not all numbers^

but only those which we designate by nought and unity. The author next pro-
ceeded to consider the symbolical methods in logic which owe their origin to the
' Laws of Thought,' by Boole. He noticed particularly the method of Professor
Jevons, as developed in ' The Principles of Science ' ; of Mr. Hugh McOoll in his

'Calculus of Equivalent Statements,' and of Dr. Macfarlane, in his 'Algebra of
 Logic' Eeference was also made to the recently published work of Mr. Venn, on
 ' Symbolic Logic,' which the author characterised as a powerful defence of th©
Booleian method.

     Two galvanometers were used simultaneously, one {called the potential gahano-

 ineter) for measuring- the difference of potentials between the two terminals of the
 lamp, the other (called the current galvanometer) for measuring the whole
 strength of the current through the lamp.

     The potential galvanometer had for its coil several thousand metres of No. 50
(B.W.G.) silk-covered wire (of which the copper w.-ighs about ^-^ gramme per
 metre, and therefore has resistance of about 3 ohms per metre). Its electrodes
were applied direct on the platinum terminals of the lamp.

      The current galvanometer had for its coil a single circle of about 10 centimetres
diameter, of thick wire placed in the direct circuit of the lamp, by means of elec-

 trodes kept close together to a sufficient distance from the galvanometer to ensure

no sensible action on the needle except from the circle itself. The directive force
on the needle wliich was produced by a large semi-circular horse-shoe magnet of
small sectional area was about 2i c.g.s., or 15 times the earth's horizontal magnetic
force in London. This arrangement would have been better for the potential
galvanometer also than the plan actually used for it, which need not be described
here. The scale of each galvanometer was graduated according to the natural
tangent of the angle of detiectioii, so that the strength of the current was simply
proportional to the number read on the scale in each case.

     Three lamps were used, Nos. II. and III. of a larger size than No. T. The ex-
periment was continued with higher and higher potentials on each lamp till its

carbon broke.

     The illuminating power was measured in the .simplest and easiest way (which

is also the most accurate and trustworthy), by letting the standard light and the
lamp to be measured shed tlieir lights nearly in the same direction on a white
ground (a piece of white paper was used) ; and comparing the shadows of a suit-
able object (a pencil was used) ; and varying the distance of the standard light
from the white ground till the illuminations of the two shadows were judged
equal. The standard used was a regulation ' standard candle,' burning 120 grains

of wax in the hour. The burning was not actually tested by weighing; but it was

no doubt very nearly right ; nearly enough for our purpose, which was an approxi-
mate determination of the illuminating powers of each lamp through a wide range
of electric power applied to it. The following results were obtained :

REPOKT 1881.

 in the sodium vapour placed in the Bunsen flame is strong for a certain set of
 yellow vibrations, and weak for a certain set of green vibrations. If the Bunsen

 flame is now removed into an enclosui'e tlie temperature of which is equal to its-

 self, the internal radiation in the gi-een will suddenly be raised, while that in the

 yellow will not be (appreciably) affected. As tlieremust be some relation between

 the internal radiation and the energy of vibration of the molecules, the gi-een
 vibrations will be raised in intensity and be made more nearly equal to the yellow

 vibrations.

     Tlie following may show a little more clearly that the relative intensities of
 the vibrations need not be the same when the body is placed in an enclosure of
 uniform temperature, as when it is allowed to radiate into space.

      Imao'ine a set of molecides not losing any heat by radiation, and assiune that
 the molecules are, like the sodium molecules, capable of vibrating in two distinct
 periods, one corresponding to the yellow, and one corresponding to the green rays.
 There is a constant interchange between energy of translatory motion and energy

 of vibratory motion, and we imagine that the energy of translation is more easily

 transformed into yellow vibrations than into gi-een vibrations. If the average

 energy for each set remains constant, it is because the energy of vibration is at the
 same time for other molecules transformed into energy of translation, and the
 yellow vibrations more easily than the green vibrations. The mathematical cal-

 culations of Maxwell and Boltzmann have shown that when the final equilibrium
 is reached, the final energy of vibration for the two periods must be the same.
 Imagine now the gas to be taken out of the euclosiu-e and allowed to radiate into
. space. During the first instant, the yellow and the green vibrations will Ije of the
 same intensity, but very soon the molecular encounters will show their influence.

 We have assumed that yellow vibrations are more easily produced than green vi-

 brations. While, therefore, the gi'een vibrations are allowed to decrease in inten-
 sity, that of the yellow rays is constantly renewed by the encounters. It follows

 that the yellow rays \\ill now appear the brighter, though in the enclosm-e of uni-
 form temperature the energy of radiation for the green light was as large. The
 mere fact therefore that we observe lines of different intensities in the spectra of

  bodies is not in itself sufficient to invalidate Boltzmann's theoretical conclusion.

 But other considerations show that these conclusions are not supported by experi-
 ment. Thus, from the ratio of the two speciffc heats of mercury vapour, Boltzmann

 concludes that the molecule of mercury is a rigid particle, incapable of rotating or
 vibrating. It is suggested that forces due to the vibrations themselves, which have

 been neglected by Boltzmann, may be the cause of the discrepancy between theory

 and experiment.

                                  Action. By J. Brown.

     The author exhibited and described an instrument for measuring the difference
of potential of two substances in contact while immersed in any desired gas. The
metals to be examined are formed into a pair of quadrants fixed on an ebonite sup-
port in the apparatus, and their potential-difference is examined by means of a
needle similar to half that in Sir William Thomson's electrometer, swinging over
the slit between them, and suspended by a platinum wu-e, -OOl-inch diameter from
a torsion head at the top of an ebonite tute rising from the cover of the airtight
metal case enclosing the quadrants, and into which any required gas can be intro-
duced. The needle is electrified by connecting its suspension wire to either pole of
a 100-cell Daniell battery, and its deflections are observed by mirror and scale.
One quadrant is kept permanently connected with the earth, while a wire, joined to
the other and passing airtight through the case, provides means for connecting the
two together metallically, or one to each pole of any cell with theE.M.F. of which
it is desired to compare their potential-difference either by Kohlrausche's method or
that of Su- William Thomson (' B.A. Report,' 1880).

    As the observed potential-difference of copper and zinc continually decreases
with the oxidation of their .surfaces in the air, a series of observations was made to

   the time of cleaning, and considering that, even when just cleaned, the plates cannot

   be considered quite clean, this value corresponds very well to the ratio of the differ-

   --ence of the heats of combination of copper and zinc with oxygen to the heat-equi-

   valent of a Daniell cell according to Thomsen -90

   ·82D to '880. When the copper was wet with copper sulphate solution, and the

   zinc with zinc sulphate, thus constituting the analogue of a Daniell cell, the differ-
   ence of potential was '98 Daniell.

        The experiments seem to support the view, that the potential-difference of sub-
   stances in contact is dependent on the chemical action going on at their exposed

   surfaces.

                              By Edward Crosslet, F.B.A.S.

        The light from the lamp is thrown into the hollow horizontal axis of the
   microscope with the aid of the bidl's-eye condenser, and by a prism placed in the
   centre of this axis, is reflected forwards in the direction of the axis on which the
   swinging sub-stage turns.

        The arm of the swinging sub-stage is made in the form of a box, and carries a
   second prism in the axis on which it moves, so as to intercept the rays of light
   coming from the first prism, and reflect them in the direction of the arm or box.

       At the end of the box is a third prism, which throws the rays of light forward

   on to the mirror by means of which they are finally directed to the object on

   the stage.

       No change in position of the microscope on its horizontal axis affects the

   direction of the light from the lamp ; and whatever the position of the swinging
   sub-stage, whether above or below the stage, the illumination remains constant
   iipon the object. Thus the greatest facility is given for illuminating the object at
   any angle, and seeing which is most suitable.

       The prisms are 1-inch, and give sufficient light for a ^in. object-glass with a

   BRoss eyepiece, using, of course, a suitable condenser beneath the stage. The

   field of a 4-inch object-glass is also fully covered.

The Nicol prism lias several defects. Its field is narrow, being limited on one

side by the ordinary ray, which ceases at a certain angle to be totally reflected ; and

at the other by vanishing of the extraordinary ray by total                                                                     reflexion                                     the limit of
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the field in this direction being further reduced by tlie occurrence of a blue iris,

within which faint interference-fringes may be discerned. The limitation of the

extraordinary ray ari,ses from the arrangement of the prism, in which tlie

inclination of the incident rays to the optic axis difters widely, producing the

effective residt that at a certain angle the extraordinary index is at a value not

only greater than its minimum, but greater than that of the balsam.

The author's new prism obviates this, by employing spar so cut that the optic

axis is exactly at right angles to the axis of the prism, and that the balsam film

is parallel to the optic axis. The extraordinary rays, which lie in a plane containing
.the axis of the prism and at right angles to the optic axis, are aU therefore

transmitted, and the limitation on this side of the field Is therefore removed. Of

other rays It will be noted that, as the angle at which they cut the optic axis

diminishes, their angle of incidence on the balsam film increases, instead of

diminishing. This is, however, of no moment, as tlie aperture of the field In a

principal plane of section containing the optic axis of the crystal is still over 90°.

The available aperture of the new prism Is about 10° greater than that of the Nicol

Prism, and Its ' lateral ' aperture Is as great as that of the Nicol.

The end faces are also more ueai-ly normal to the axis of the prism, thereby

reducing loss of light by reflexion.

 12. On an Overlapping Spectroscope. Bij James Love, F.B.A.8., F.G.8.

     In the in.strument described by the author, one spectroscope was fixed, another
being capable of rotation about Its own axis, and of a small angular movement In
their common plane, about a line passing through the point of intersection of their
axes. The light which had passed through the movable spectro.scope was refiected
at the surface of the dispersion prism of the fixed spectroscope, and entered the eye
looking along its axis. The results obtained by the author, in working with
this instrument, dlfier in some respects from those already described by previous

observers.

13. On Change of Density at the Melting Point.
         By James Love, F.B.A.S., F.G.8.

It is commonly supposed that bodies, as a general rule, contract their

dimensions, and rapidly become more dense, as they pass from the liquid to the

solid condition ; and that those bodies which expand and become less dense on

solidifying, such as water and cast iron, are exceptions to the general rule.

For the purpose of testing this so-called rule I have experimented on a few

bodies at their melting points, and find that, as far as the experiments go, the

' exceptions ' are sufficiently numerous to form a class by themselves. The method

used was to heat the body to its melting temperature and observe whether the

solid woulijloat or sink in its own liquid. The bodies experimented on may be

arranged into two classes, iiamely: Class A. Bodies whose solids sink in their

own liquid, and Class B. Bodies whose solids ^oat in their own liquid ; or, for

--shortness, sinking solids and floating solids. They are as follows:

or floating' was very decided; but in a few cases the observations needed a
considerable amount of care. For instance, solid lead would readily sink when
the temperature of tlie liqiiid was mucli above its melting point ; but just at its
melting point the sinkage was so very slight that there was some difficulty
in determining whether the solid really did sink or not, a thin film of dirt being
quite sufficient to keep it from sinking. With phosphor bronze, brass, and the

second white metal, the flotation of the solid was very slight ; but with the other

Bbodies of Class the floating was very decided. Copper, a body usually given as

a sinking solid, floats with considerable buoyancy.

                14. On Drops and Gafillarity. By Dr. T. Woods.

     The intention of this paper is to show that every liquid has a specific volume of
drop, a definite number of drops of each liquid always occupying the same bulk
under similar circumstances ; and that, however varied circumstances may be,
provided they change equally with all, the relation of volume of drop is maintained
between the several liquids examined.

  --In it is also shown that this specific volume is proportional to the capillarity of

the liquids the greater the capillarity the larger the drop.

   --It is suggested that this property may be useful in analysis a ready method,

for instance, of detecting the amount of dilution of a fluid.

               --1-5. On Binaural Audition. Part III.'

          By Professor SiLVANUS P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

The beats of mistimed consonances of the form n : 1 have lately claimed some

attention on account of the revival of the dispute between Dr. Konig and the

mathematical acousticians concerning the origin of the difierence-tones or grave

harmonics, Konig holding to Smith's theory that the beats, when sufficiently

rapid, pass into Ijeat-tones, which all mathematical physicists agree is physically

impossible if the tones are simple, and if so small an amplitude that the squares

Aand higher powers of the displacements may be neglected  very important paper

on this matter, by Mr. Bosanquet of Oxford, has lately appeared (' Phil. Mag.'

June 1881), in which he states: (i.) that these tones are subjective; (ii.) that they

consist of variations in intensity of tlie lower tone; (iii.) that if the squares and

higher powers of the displacements be not neglected in the equations, a term appears

having a period whose frequency is the diflerence of the frequencies of the

generating tones, as required by Helmholtz's theory of the difl'erence-tones.

This question was alluded to in the author's previous papers on Phenomena of

Binaural Audition (' Brit. Ass. Eep.' 1877, 1878). He found beats to be heard, but

not differential tones, from two tones led separately to the two ears.

The author has lately examined with care the beats of the mistimed unison,

octave, twelfth, and double-octave, bringing the sounds separately to the two ears

by tubes. He has heard beats in all these cases, and in every case found them to

consist of variations in intensity of the lower tone. The use of resonators

intensified the phenomena.

The author also recounted experiments in which partial interference was

obtained between an objective tone, and a subjective tone imposed upon the ear by

fatigue.

He also announced a new illusion of binaural hearing due to fatigue, the

apparent dii-ection of a source of sound being altered by the previous fatigue of

one ear.

     In a former communication (' Brit. Ass. Report,' 1880) a new organo-mercury
compound was described, of which the interesting feature was the bivalent

character of the hydrocarbon radical contained in it, viz. methylene ; this being,
so far as I can ascertain, the iii'st body ever obtained of its class.

      The bivalent function of the organic radical, as well as of the metal, naturally
suggests the existence of another compound, similar to the first, but containing an
additional atom of mercury, thus :

                                               1° I CHjHgl.
                                             2° I HgOH,,HgI.

     This second compound, which is related to methylene iodide in the same way
as mercuric iodomethide (CHjHgl) is to methyl iodide, can be easily obtained by

exposing a mixture of methjdene iodide, with an excess of mercury, to the action
of light. It is desirable to add a little mercuric iodide, so as to form mercurous
iodide, whose action has been fully^explained in the paper already referred to. It
is also necessary to add a sufficient quantity of ether, so as to keep the mixture in
the fluid condition, even towards the end of the reaction. The reaction takes from
one to several days, according to the state of weather and fi-equency of shaking.

   --In order to get the compound in a state of purity the following plan was

adopted : Ether is distilled off, and the residue is digested with a strong aqueous
solution of potassic iodide. It is washed, first with water containing potassic
iodide, and afterwards with pure water, till the washing is free from iodide, and

then dried. It is now heated with methylene iodide, whereby any excess of mercury

collects at the bottom of the beaker into a globule, leavijig above it a clear yellow
solution. The latter is decanted, and, on cooling, crystals are rapidly deposited
the first crops consist of pure di-mercury compound, whilst later portions and the
mother liquor contain the mono-mercury compound. The first portions are drained,
washed with methylene iodide, and then thoroughly with ether till a drop of the
washings rapidly evaporates without leaving any oily residue.

     Di-mercury methylene iodide thus obtained is a yellowish crystalline powder

    It melts somewhere about 230° C, with partial decomposition. Bj^ acting upon

lished record of one year's progress of the science fifty years ago with one of

who formerly devoted their whole time and energy to the advancement of
chemistry, or who were engaged in industrial pursuits involving a knowledge of

endeavour to trace them to their causes, and to discover the guiding principles,
which have brought them about : he will try to derive, from a knowledge of

--those guiding principles, a perception of the means by which such progress can

best be continued and extended how it can be most effectively directed to the-

benefit of his fellow-men.

It is on this aspect of the question that I propose to address you to-day.

The process of scientific investigation includes a great variety of operations,

Wewhich may be considered UT\der three headings, mental, sensual, and physical.

think, we observe, and we work with our hands. lu planning a new "experiment

we call to mind what is known of the phenomena in question, and form an opinion'

as to what is likely to happen under conditions somewhat different from those
Wewhich existed in previous experiments.
                                          regulate by careful observations the

necessary manual operations, so as to obtain with accuracy the desired conditions

for the new experiment, and we observe attentively the changes which take place

in the course of that experiment. The result of such observations is sometimes

in accordance with our anticipation, but very frequently at variance with it. If

it accords with our anticipation, we put on record the extension which it has given

to the application of the general theory on which that anticipation was founded.

But if the result is not what we expected, we carefully and critically revise the

reasoning which had led us to expect a particular result, and often repeat the same

experiment with greater care, or some modification of it.

Materials for a new theory are gained when logically fiiultless reasoning,

checked by accurate observations, have led to results which could not have been

foreseen by the aid of any previous theory'. When a theory has thus gained a

footing in science, it serves as a guide in further work. It guides us in arranging

known facts. It guides us to the discovery of new facts. Sometimes it does

these things for a short time only, and is then superseded by some more general

theory derived from a wider and more comprehensive view of the faits.

There is, perhaps, nowhere so severe and rigorous a test of the truth of an

idea as that which is afforded by its use in any accurate department of experi-

mental science ; and it is worth while, on philosophical grounds, to consider briefly

the conditions of growth of the chief chemical theories which have withstood this

ordeal and proved themselves to be trustworthy guides in experimental science.

    Now as far as I know them, the general theories wliich have played the chief

part in the development of chemistry are mere condensed statements "of fact.

Every thoughtful man of science has doubtless indulged in speculations to find

the cause of facts which are as yet unexplained ; has imagined some fundamental

condition or property of matter which might cause it to produce effects such as

are witnessed. It is to be hoped that the time may be far distant when men of

science will confine their thoughts within the range of ideas which are proved to

be true._ But it is most important that they should not confuse such hypothetical

speculations with theories which have received experimental verification, and that

while employing any theory, they should not lose sight of the limits within which

it has been proved to be correct, beyond which it can only be used as an hypothesis.

The foundation of the science of chemistry was laid by the discovery of chemical

elements; those distinct varieties of matter which we can neither produce nor

destroy. Chemical science treats of those changes of property in matter which can

be represented as due to changes of combination of elementary atoms. It knows

nothing of the production or destruction of those elementary atoms. Speculations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

respecting their ultimate form or structure will have found a place in the pcience
as soon as such speculations have helped to arrange the facts which are known, and

to discover new chemical facts.
     At the commencement of our epoch chemists had classified elements according

to their electro-chemical properties. Chemical analysis had established the fact
that a good many compounds could be represented as consisting of elementary
atoms of two kinds combined in small number. Thus carbonic oxide and carbonic
acid had been found to possess respectively a composition which could be repre-

sented (adopting our present atomic symbols) by the formulae CO and COo, water

by the formula 11^ 0, marsh gas CH^, olefiant gas CH.^. The oxides and acids of
nitrogen were represented by formulae corresponding empirically to those which

we now adopt. So also ammonia and hj'dric chloride had their present formulae.

Sulphurous and sulphuric acid had the respective formulae SO.^ and SO3. Phos-
phorous and phosphoric acid had the formulae, P.fis ^^^ -Pa^^s- Baryta and the
oxides of iron had the formulae BaO, FeO, Fe^Oj.

     Such primary compounds were classified upon the same principle which served
for the classification of the elements themselves, into electro-positive or basylous
and electro-negative or chlorous compounds, and the smallest quantity of each of
them, which consistently with an atomic representation of the results of analysis,
was deemed capable of existing, was called an atom of that compound.

     Very simple compounds possessed of prominent characteristics and distinct re-
actions had first been isolated and identified. They were found to contain their
constituent elements in proportions easily recognisable as multiples of atomic
weights. But such simple compounds are rare exceptions among mineral and
organic m.aterials, and if the atomic theory could have gone no further than to
guide us to an understanding of these few simple compounds, it must soon have
given place to some more fundamental conception. It is moreover worthy of notice
that in this its most elementary form the atomic theory was not the only con-
ceivable interpretation of the proportions of combination between elements. Those
proportions could be as consistently represented by fractions as by integral mul-

tiples. Thus, instead of representing carbonic acid as containing twice as much
oxygen as is contained in carbonic oxide, we might have represented it as containing
the same quantity of oxygen combined with half as much carbon, and using for the
moment atomic symbols for a non-atomic theory, we might have written carbonic

--acid thus 0. Or we might represent them both by percentage numbers.

     It was so simple and natural to adopt the atomic hypothesis, and to represent
compounds as built up of atoms, that chemists seem to have paid little attention to
any other mode of representing the proportions of combination. They assumed
that the variable proportions of elements, which were observed in compounds, were
due to the various numbers of elementary atoms respectively aggregated together
in each compound. They perceived tliat the existence of elementary atoms
involved the existence of compound atoms, or molecules, as we now call them,
and accordingly they represented each known compound of two elements by a
molecular formula as simple as possible, consistently with the view of its atomic
constitution. Many of these molecules, such as those of the acids, were found to
be capable of combining with others of the other class, forming salts, and those
combinations were found to take place in proportions corresponding to the weights
of the respective molecules, or to very simple multiples of those weights, and the
secondary compounds or salts thus formed combined (if at all) in proportions
corresponding to simple multiples of their molecular weights. The dualistic

representation of the constitution of salts served to represent the results of their

analysis, consistently with the atomic theory, and a vast number of fundamental
facts were collected and arranged by the aid of the dualistic theory of combination.

     The actual numbers obtained by analysis of any particular compound exhibited

sometimes a very near approximation to those required by an atomic formula of its
composition. Sometimes they differed considerably from those required by theory
but it was always found that the more pure the substance and the more accurate
the analytical operations, the more nearly did the result agree with some atomic
formula of the substance.
                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.              571

The compound atoms were units which had p:rown out of the atomic theory.

Each of them was the smallest quantity of a compound, which (consistently with

the results of analysis) could be represented as built dualistically of its constituent

atoms.

Chemical combination was viewed as a process of juxtaposition of simple or

compound atoms, little account being taken of the disturbance of the previous
arrangement of those compound atoms. It was when a constitution, similar to

that attributed to salts, was imagined for other compounds not saline in their
character, that the dualistic theory broke down. Thus chlorocarbonic acid was
represented as a compound of carbonic acid with carbonic chloride, and was
accordingly designated as carbonate of carbonic chloride, while the formula was

made to contain the formulae of those bodies. Chlorosulphuric acid and chloro-
chromic acid were in like manner represented as compounds of sulphuric and

chromic acid respectively with imaginary hexachlorides.

Careful investigations of the reactions in which chlorocarbonic acid takes part

showed, however, that in each of them it behaves as a compound containing only

two atoms of chlorine. It was found that the commonest and best-known car-

bonates and sulphates have a fundamentally similar constitution. Thus potassic

carbonate may be represented as a compound in which the two atoms of chlorine

Kin phosgene are replaced by two atoms of the radical    ; and oil of vitriol, as a

compound of two atoms of hydroxyl with the same group, S O.,, which in chloro-

sulphuric acid is combined with two atoms of chlorine. Chlorochromic acid has
not been examined to as great an extent as the above compounds, but all we know

of it points clearly to its having a molecular constitution similar to that of chloro-

sulphuric acid, viz. CI,, Cr Oj, for not only do their vapour-densities agree, but the

chromates in their constitution and crystalline forms exhibit a clear analogy to the

sulphates.

Moreover, the simpler molecular formulae, which a fuller knowledge of their

chemical behaviour suggested for these bodies, were found in all cases to agree with

the volume belonging to the molecule of every pure substance known in the state

of vapour.

   A difficulty of another kind had been foreseen by the great founder of the

dualistic system, and it was by the investigations in organic chemistry that it

assumed serious proportions.

Carbon compounds were discovered possessing definite and specific properties,

and presenting the characteristics of pure substances, but of which the results of

analyt-is did not agree with any simple proportion between the numbers of their

constituent atoms. Their empyrical composition could not be decided by the aid

of the so-called law of multiple proportions, for two or more atomic formulae

required percentages of the constituents differing so little from one another that

analysis could not decide which was the true one.

     In order to select the true molecular formulae of such complex substances from

among those which approached most nearly to the results of ultimate analysis, and

to determine with certainty their empirical composition, it was necessary to find
other methods for the determination of molecular weights. It was necessary to
study the various properties of compounds of known composition, and of others

which could be prepared iu a state ot purity ; to determine the vapour densities
and rates of diffusion of those which could be obtained in the gaseous state with-

out decomposition ; to determine boiling points and melting points ; to examine
crystalline forms of pure compounds and of mixtures ; to determine solubilities
and densities of solids and of liquids; but above all it was necessary to collect
fuller and more accurate knowledge of the chemical changes which take place in

the mutual reaction of molecules.

   A vast amount of accurate and careful work of these kinds has been done, and

has been subjected to rigid and often hostile scrutiny during the various stages of

Weits progress.  now know that couipound atoms, or molecules as we call them,

which can be identified by their geometrical, mechanical, and other properties, are
the same as the compound atoms indicated by the most comprehensive chemical

evidences of composition and reactions. The molecular constitution of matter was
572 REPORT-- 1881.

predicted implicitly by the atomic theory of the constitution of the elements; and,

wherever the physical properties of the molecules are such as aft'ord any basis for

the determination of their relative weights, such results cagree with those derived

from purely chemical considerations guided by the atomic tbeory.

Our knowledge of molecules is us yet in its infancy. Even among the com-

monest elements and compounds we know the molecular weights of very few, but

what we do know of them proves that the idea of compound atoms invented by

chemists to explain the elementary facts of chemical action is, as far as it goes, a

true representation of what exists in nature.

Many of the molecules thus proved to exist were the same as those suggested

under the dualistic system ; but many were proved, by the more accurate and

extensive knowledge of their reactions and properties, to have different weights

from those which had been at first attributed to them, yet always consistent with

the fundamental requirements of the atomic theory. Thus H2O, CO, CO,,, CH^,,

SOj, SO3, CaO, FeO, FcoOj are the formulae still used to denote the molecules of

the respective compounds, though the last three ought probably to be represented

by some multiple. On the other hand, the molecule of defiant gas is now repre-

sented by the formula C^H^, instead of CH.j. The chloracetate is C^ClaHOj, instead

of CjClg, C5O3, HjO. The molecule of benzoil chloride is C^H^OCl, instead of one

corresponding to (0,^115)203, C^H^CL, and chlorosulphuric acid is Cl^SO^, instead
of2S03, SClg.

In proportion as chemists came to know more of the constitution of molecules^

and to study chemical reactions from the point of view of the changes which they

bring about in the constitution of molecules, did the idea of substitution come to

Abe more and more used in the place of that of mere additive combination.  vast

number of processes of chemical combination, which had been considered as con-

sisting of direct combination, were found to be processes of double decomposition.

One of the most important facts which was brought to light by the careful

examination of the composition of salts and organic bodies, aided by the molecular

method of representing their constitution, was that hydrogen is chemically one of

the metals, and that the compounds formed by the combination of water with

acids are analogous to other salts of those acids ; while compounds of hydrogen

with elements or radicals like chlorine are salts, analogous in their constitution to

other chlorides, &c.

The molecular or unitary mode of viewing the constitution of each substance

affords more true as well as more simple records of the facts observed in chemical

Areactions than could be obtained in the dualistic systems.  salt such as hydric

sulphate used to be considered as containing sulphuric acid and water, and repre-

sented by a formula such as SO3, H^O, implying the presence in it of both the

substances from which it was known to be formed.

    When two elements combined, their product was considered and described as-

containing the elementary atoms which had served to form it, and it was consistent

with this habit to represent a product which had been formed by the combination

of two compound molecules as containing those molecules.

But the main business of chemical investigation is to observe accurately the

changes of composition which take place in the reactions of known substances,

with a view of discovering the atomic interchanges to which they are due.

     The compound formed by the combination of sulphuric acid and water differs
in many physical and chemical properties from both of those bodies. Its name and

its atomic formula serve to denote the aggregate of properties which are known

to belong to it, whereas the dualistic formula, SO3, H^O, served to recall the pro-

perties of the acid and base from which it was formed, rather than those of the

compound itself.

Elementary chemical reactions which according to the binary mode of viewing-

compounds were supposed to consist of dualistic processes involving sometimes

the assumption of forces (like predisposing affinity) of a purely metaphysical

character, were now explained as consisting of atomic displacements, or inter-

changes of a kind well known to be of common occurrence. Thus the evolution

of hydrogen by the action of zinc on aqueous hydric sulphate was supposed to be
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  573

 the result of a decomposition of water by the metal, such decomposition being
 indui-ed by the presence of the acid (SO,), which exerted a predisposing affinity
 for the zinc oxide. Our present explanation is a simple stateuient of the fact, that
 under the conditions described, zinc displaces hydrogen from its sulphate.

      The recognition and study of the metallic functions of hydrogen enabled
 ·chemists to obtain far clearer and simpler views of the constitution of salts, and
 to observe the differences of property which are produced in them by the replace-
 ment of one element bj' another. It enabled us to see more and more clearly the
 characttristic functions of each element, by comparing the constitution and pro-

 perties of the salts containing it with those of the corresponding salts containing

 '·"ther elements.

      Thus in the dualistic system we had for the three common phosphates,
 PO.Nag. PO^Na.^II, P04NaH2, molecular formulte in which sodium was represented
 with twice as great an atomic weight as that which we attribute to it, and which
in our atomic weights may be thus represented, viz. P^Oj, 3Na,0 ; PoOj, 2Na, ;
PjO^, NajO. In like manner we had such a formula as P0O3, 2Na^0 (tor the phos-
 phite PO^NajH), and for the hypophosphite PO^NaHj we had a formula cor-

 responding to PjO, Na20.

      Determinations of water of crystallisation and of chemically combined water
proved that many of the compounds assumed on the dualistic system to exist
 are either not obtainable or have different properties and a different constitution

 from those which have been described. Thus we now know that the salts
PO^Na^H, POjNaH.j, POgNa.^H, and PO^NaH^ cannot be deprived of the ele-

 ments of water without undergoing a fundamental change of composition and of

 properties.

      The atomic weights of the alkali metals and of silver were found to be half of
those of the dualistic system, and an atom of one of these metals, in common
double decompositions between their salts and hydrogen-salts, changes place with
one atom of hydrogen.

     Many products of the combination of known molecules were found to be

formed by processes of double decomposition, so that each molecule of such
products is built up partly of atoms derived from one of the materials, partly of
atoms from the other. Thus potassic hydrate is formed by the combination of a
molecule of potash with one of wai-er. Yet each molecule of the hydrate is built
up of half a molecule of potash and half a molecule of water.

     The study of organic compounds played an important part in the improvement
-of our processes of reasoning. Many of their molecules having a very complex
structure were found to undergo in most of their reactions very simple changes, of
the same kind as those which mineral compounds undergo. Most of the elements
of each organic molecule remained combined together with functions analogous to
those of hydrogen or chlorine.

     The theory of radicals which had been suggested by the reactions of ammonia-
aalts and of cyanides was largely extended in organic chemistry.

     Many families of organic compounds were discovered in each of which the
members are connected by close analogy of constitution and of properties. Each
of these families forms what is called a homologous series, each term of the series
being a compound of which the molecule contains one atom of carbon and two

atoms of hydrogen more than the previous term.
     Thus a series of compounds was proved to have reactions similar to those of

common alcohol, and molecular weights ranging from 32 to 438. The lower terms

of the series are distinguished from one another by differences of boiling points
approximately proportional to the number of atoms of carbon and hydrogen by
"which they differ from one another ; whilst the higher terms undergo decompo-

sition at the high temperatures required for their evaporation, and are distinguished
from one another by differences of melting points, that of the alcohol CjQHgjO
being about 86° C. In their constitution these alcohols were found to be analogous

to the alkaliue hydrates.

     In like manner various other series of alcohols were discovered corresponding

respectively in their constitutions to other classes of metallic hydrates. Series
                    ;

--574 BEPOKT 1881.

 were also found of which the members present analogies of reaction with mono-
 basic, bibasic, and tribasic hydrogen salts respectively.

     These and many other such discoveries were made under the guidance of the

 atomic theory, developed to the point of systematically recognising and studying

 the mutual reactions of molecules.
      One of the most remarkable and important extensions which our knowledge of

 molecules has undergone consisted in the discovery that various elements in what
we are accustomed to consider the free state, really consist of molecules containing
 like atoms combined with one another.

       Thu.s chemists adopt the formulse 0,^, H^, CI2, P,, J.^, As^, to denote molecules

of the respective elements, and we have for these molecular formulae evidences of

 the same kinds as those which serve to establish the molecular formulae OIH, H^O,
NH3, &c. In all the best-known reactions in which chlorine or hydrogen are
 either taken up or evolved we find that those elements behave as chemical com-
pounds of two like atoms ; and, moreover, their molecules, as determined from a
study of their reactions, have the same volume as that of every compound molecule

 proved to evaporate without decomposition.

     With this knowledge of the molecular constitution of hydrogen and of chlorine
gases, we come to regard the direct formation of hydric chloride as due to a process
of double decomposition between two molecules, like the reaction of chlorine on
an equal volume of marsh gas.

     Many other reactions, such as the evolution of hydrogen by the action of zinc

on a hydrogen salt, the liberation of chlorine and nitrogen on the explosive decom-

position of their compound, the direct combination of oxysjen and hydrogen, we

mav expect to be able to resolve into mere proce->ses of double decomposition.
     The earliest determinations of combining proportions were made with salts

(hydrogen salts and others) which undergo double decomposition by mutual contact,
and the term equivalent was subsequently introduced to indicate the proportional
weights of analogous substances found to be of equal value in their chemical effects.
Tables of equivalent weights of acids consisted of numbers standing to one another
in the same proportions as the weights of the respective substances found to be of
equal value in neutralising a fixed quantity of a particular base ; and in like
manner tables of the equivalent weights of bases recorded the proportions by
weight in which certain bases might replace one another in the neutralisation of
a particular quantity of a given acid. Similar determinations have been tabulated
of the so-called equivalent weights of elements. Under the dualistic system
chemists paid little attention to the essential difference between atomic weights
and equivalent weights; and some were of opinion that the facts of chemistry
might be represented as consistently from the point of view of equivalence as from
that of atoms, and that the idea of atoms (which they considered to be hypothetical)

might be dispensed with.
     In the system of atomic weights employed under that system, two atoms of

hydrogen were generally represented as reacting together, and the symbol of the

double atom was marked thus, ff. The alkali metals and silver were represented
as having atomic weights twice as great as those which we now adopt, and
equivalent to those of the magnesian metals and of oxygen. In a great number
of the common reactions of these elements the atomic symbols were consistently-
used as equivalent symbol.«. But those who professed to dispense with the atomic
theory used atomic symbols, even in cases where they did not represent equivalent
weights. Thus nitrogen was always represented by its atomic symbol, and the
composition and reactions of nitrogen compounds were always studied and repre-
sented in accordance with the atomic theory, using various multiple proportions
of what they were still pleased to call equivalent weights, using molecular weights,
and various other ideas which formed part of the atomic theory, and which had
no known connection with the notion of fixed equivalence. If, however, it be
true that all chemical compounds consist of elementary atoms, and that the
explanation of chemical reactions consists in stating more and more precisely the
changes of combination between the constituent atoms of the reacting molecules
equivalence could only be said to exist between a like number of atoms when they
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  575

were known to have similar functions. It became necessary to study the relation
 of equivalence between elementary atoms, instead of studying them from the point
 of view of elements divisible in any proportion.

      It is worth while noticing the general process by which this intellectual chano-e

 was brought about; for there is a good deal yet to be done in the matter, and our

future progress may be guided by experience gained in the past.

      It was essentially one-sided. One consideration was brought into very
 prominent relie', and it threw a marvellous light on the matter. It gave us a
clear view of the natural order among elements : but, like every other strong lio-ht,

it fell on one side only.

      The equality of vapour-volumes had been used with great advantage in con-

junction with chemical reactions and other evidence as a characteristic of
molecules, and the attention of chemists was greatly arrested by the consideration
of four tj'pical compounds, which upon the concurrent evidence of very extensive

chemical examination and equality of vapour-volumes were known to have
respectively a composition corresponding to the formulae CIH, OH2, NII3, CH^.

     It was known that the atom of oxygen in water can be replaced by chlorine,
but that two atoms of chlorine are needed for the purpose. The atom of nitroo-en
in ammonia requires three atoms of chlorine to replace it, whilst in marsh gas the
atom of carbon is replaceable by four atoms of chlorine. Other elements were

studied from the point of view of their respective resemblance to these, and arranged
in classes, each of which consisted of atoms equivalent to one another. Thus
chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine, hydrogen, potassium, sodium, lithium, silver,
&c., constituted a class of atoms of equal value, and were called monads. Oxygen,

sulphur, selenium, tellurium, calcium, strontium, barium, magnesium, zinc,
cadmium, mercury, lead, copper, &c., were classed together as dyads, having equal
value amongst themselves, but double the atomic value of the members of the
first class. So nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, with boron, and
some other elements, were considered as forming a class of atoms each of which
has three times the value of the monads. The class of tetrads contained carbon,

silicon, tin, platinum, &c.

     Many apparent exceptions to these atomic values were satisfactorily explained
as due to the partial combination of like atoms with one another. Thus in the

 vast majority of hydrocarbons, such as C^H^, C,,H^, C^Hj, &c., the atoms of
carbon do not appear to be tetravalent, inasmuch as each of the molecules contains
less than four atoms of hydrogen to every one atom of carbon. It was well known,
however, that polyvalent atoms can combine partly with one element, partly with

another, and also that like atoms can combine with one another. Why then should

not two tetravalent atoms like carbon combine respectively with three atoms of a
monad, and also combine with one another? The compound must be a single
molecule with the properties known to belong to methyle C.^ Hg. Again, if this
molecule were deprived of two of its atoms of hydrogen, each of the atoms of

carbon must combine further with the other atom of carbon forming H., C C H.,

Hfind a further step in this same direction would give us acetylene C C H, in which

each atom of carbon is combined with the other to the extent of three quarters of

its value, and with one atom of hydrogen. An extension of this reasoning led ta

the discovery of long chains of atoms of carbon, each atom forming a link, and each
of them (short of the ends) being combined with two other atoms of carbon, whilfr
it-i saturation is completed by hydrogen.

      Similar partial combinations of like atoms with one another were recoo-nised in

many other classes of compounds, and there is strong reason to expect that the

application of the principle will be far more widely extended in proportion as our
knowledge of the silicates and other complex classes of compounds becomes some-
what definite.

     This incorporation of the doctrine of equivalence into the atomic theory by the
division of the elements into classes consisting respectively of equivalent atoms, was
probably one of the most important general steps as yet made in the development
of the atomic theory. It was seen to correspond in so clear and striking a manner
with a vast number of well-known properties and reactions of compounds as to-

 deserve and ac-quire the confident trust of chemists. But, as often happens in such

·cases, this confidence in the result carried many of them too far. It led them to
 assume that atomic values in all other chemical compounds must be alvraj's the
same as in the compounds under consideration. They sav? that they had got hold
of the truth, and they thought it was the vs^hole truth. For instance, one most
 distinguished chemist assumed that each elementary atom has only one value in its
compounds; that the atom of nitrogen has alv^ays the value three, as in ammonia
and its products of substitution, and that in sal ammoniac the atom of nitrogen is
chemically combined only with three atoms of hydrogen, whilst the molecule of
ammonia is in a state of molecular combination with hydric chloride. Another
most distinguished chemist admitted that nitrogen and phosphorus have two atomic

Talues, but not more than two. He held that the respective combining powers are

always satisfied by the same number of atoms, no matter what the character of the
uniting atoms may be.

     With respect to these views it may be noticed that the assumption of combina-

tion between molecules as due to some other force than that which binds together

--the constituents of each molecule in fact the assumption of molecular combination

as an unknown something different from chemical combination, is open to even
more grave objections tlian those which led us to abandon the dualistic system.

     To represent a molecule of sal ammoniac as a compound containing two mole-
cules, each one biult up by the chemical combination of the constituent atoms, and
the two united together by some other force called molecular, was hardly a step in
advance of the view which represented it as containing two molecules united
together by the same kind of force as that which holds together the atoms in each

of the constituent molecules.

     The other form of the theor)' of atomicity as an inherent property of each atom
enabling it to combine with an equal number of other atoms, whatever the cha-
racter of those other atoms may be, seems difficult to reconcile with such facts aa

the following: An atom of nitrogen is not known to combine with more than

three atoms of hydrogen alone, or of substances like hydrogen, but it forms
stable compounds with five atoms (as in the ammonia salts), when four of them

are basylous and one of them is chlorous. An atom of sulphur is not known to

combine with more than two atoms of hydrogen alone, but it forms stable com-
pounds with four atoms, if three of them are like hydrogen, while the fourth is
chlorous. Instances like these are plentiful, and they lead us to look to the
-chemical characters of the atoms bound together in one molecule as a fundamental
condition of the atomic value of the element which binds them together.

      Theoretical limitations of natural forces are very difficult of proof, and it is
well to be slow and cautious in adopting any such limitation.

    A careful consideration of the facts of the case has led me not only to dotibt the

Talidity of the supposed limits of atomic value, but to doubt whether we have

grounds for assigning any limits whatever to such values.

    Atomic values- appear to me to be in their very nature variable quantities, and

I venture to think that chemistry will be greatly advanced by a full and careful
study of the conditions of variation of atomic values.

    Two conditions of change of atomic value are particularly worthy of notice :

      I. Temperature.

     II. The chemical character of the uniting atoms.
     Atomic values increase with fall of temperature, and diminish with rise of

temperature. An atom which is combined with as many basylous monads as it can

take up by themselves will take up chlorous monads, or both chlorous and basylous,
and reciprocally.

      In illustration of the diminution of atomic values with rise of temperature,

I may adduce the following well-known reactions : Sal ammoniac containing
nitrogen combined with five monads breaks up at a high temperature into am-
monia and hydric chloride and in like manner other ammonia salts decompose by

                                                                                                                                                  ;

heat, forming ammonia or an amide, with trivalent nitrogen. The highest chlorides
of phosphorus and of antimony are decomposed by heat into free chlorine and the
lower chloride. Potassic fluosilicate is decomposed by heat into silicic and potassic
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  577

fluorides ; and carbnnic iicid breaks up at high temperatures into a mixture of
carbonic oxide and oxygen.

     Amongst illustrations of the greater atomic values which elements assume by
combining with both chlorous and basylous atoms than with atoms of the one
kind only we may take the following cases : Platinum is a metal of which the
atom has been supposed to be always tetravalent, because it has not been found
capable of combining with more than four atoms of chlorine. The common solution
formed by aqua regia contains the compound Hj Pt Clg, a perfectly definite and
crystallisable hydrogen salt. Chemists are constantly making and using the potas-
sium and ammonium salts, &c., corresponding to it, yet they conceal from them-
selves the fact that the atom of platinum is directly combined with eight monads
by calling the compounds double salts. The atom of silicon in the silico-fluorides

such as H.J Si Fg or Ko Si F^. is combined with twice as many monads as it can

Btake up of one kind ; so boron in the crystalline salt Na F^ has a higher atomic

Talue than in its fluoride, owing to the presence of the atom of sodium.
     In like manner the atom of gold in the well-known salt NaAuCl^ has a

higher value than it can assume with chlorine alone.

      Sulphur of which the atom does not combine with more than 2 atoms of
hydrogen, forms with 3 atoms of methyle, or ethyle, and one atom of iodine, or
chlorine, &c., the well-known compounds like ISMeg; and iodine, which is con-
sidered a monad, forms the crystalline and stable periodate 0I(0H)5 and the various

metallic derivatives, such as

01 ONa    01 (ONa),,  01 (OAg),

   (OH),      (OH)f

     The crystalline compound of the perchlorate with water (HC10^2HjO) has
probably a similar constitution. Chemical journals abound with descriptions of
definite and well-characterised compounds, which have, like the above, been put
aside by the atomicity theory, as mere molecular compounds. The following

formulae are taken almost at random, in illustration of the generality of atomic
-values far beyond those acknowledged by the theory of atomicity.

Not only are there elements of which an atom is found iu combination with a

greater number of basylous and chlorous monads together than of either kind
alone, but there are also elements which are not known to form chemical compounds

with hydrogen or potassium alone, and yet which combine with either of theut

when also combined with chlorine, fluorine, &c. This is illustrated by the fol-

lowing compounds, viz. HAuCl^, H^PtClg, NaBF^, K,SiF,,, K^FeF^, KjCuCl,.

It is also well known that there are many cases of elements of which an atom
cannot combine with as many monads of one kind as of another. For instance an^

atom of nitrogen or of antimony is only known to be trivaleut in combination with

hydrogen ; but each of them occurs in the form of a pentavalent compound with
chlorine. Antimony forms either no compound with five atoms of bromine, or u

compound more unstable than the higher chloride.

Many more such instances might easily now be given, and a vast number will

doubtless be found when the investigations of chemists are directed to the search for

them. I have only given these few by way of illustration of the leading conditions

of change of atomic values.

In the course of their investigations of the precise interchanges of atoms which

take place between molecules, chemists were frequently led to observe evidences

of the order in which the constituent elements are combined ; and with the more

wide and accurate knowledge of reactions which is now in their possession, they

have been enabled to follow up so far the study of the respective state of combina-

tion of each atom in a molecule as to arrive at simple and consistent explanations

of facts which had previously eluded the grasp of science.

Our knowledge of the order of combination of atoms in a molecule and of the-

differences between direct and indirect combinations of particular atoms may be

said to have originated chiefly in the study of the compounds of nitrogen. Thus

it was found that the hydrogen in ammonia differs in many of its chemical

Afunctions from hydrogen in hydrocarbons.  base (called methylia) was dis-

covered having a molecular composition corresponding to the empirical formula

( CNHj), and this base was found to contain two atoms of hydrogen like those of
ammonia and three atoms like thtise in hydrocarbons. Its constitution was accord-

ingly represented by a formula describing it as an ammonia, in which one atom

of hydrogen is replaced by the monad methyle, or, to be more explicit, a*

containing two atoms of hydrogen directly combined with nitrogen, and three

atoms of hydrogen indirectly combined with that same atom of nitrogen through

the intervening atom of carbon. Writing in juxtaposition to one another thi'

svmbols of those atoms which are directly combined, we can express the factt^^

by the following formula, viz. HoNCHj.

Those marvellous varieties of matter called isomeric compounds found their

natural explanation in differences of the respective arrangements of like atoms.

Thus two bases were discovered having the same empirical molecular formula,

CjNH,. One of them is made by different reactions from the other, and in its-

decomposition.s differs from the other. All these chemical differences between them

are found to be due to the fact that one of them (called ethylia) contains two

atoms of hydrogen directly combined with the nitrogen, and the monovalent

hydro-carbon ethyle in place of the third atom of hydrogen ; whilst the other (called

dimethylia) contains only one atom of h3'drogen combined directly with nitrogen,

the carbon of the two atoms of methyle completing the saturation of the trivalent
H Nnitrogen, as expressed by the formula
                                          (C Hj)^.

It was subsequently proved that an atom of oxygen may combine with two like

or unlike monads, such monads being indirectly combined with one another through

the intervening atom of oxygen. Thus five of the atoms of hydrogen in common

alcohol were proved to be in direct combination with the carbon, whilst the other

Hone is indirectly combined with it through the oxygen, as expressed by the formula
         (C.jHj).

     Another compound (called methyl-oxide) was proved to have the same em-

pyrical composition, but very different properties and reactions, its constitution

being explained by the formula H3COCH3.

Again, two compounds of distinct reactions and properties were found to have

the same empirical molecular composition, C^NHg, and it was clearly proved that

in Germany) in working out the evidences of the atomic order of complex organic

bodies, and in thereby obtaining a command of their reactions.

     Evidences of the same kind have been obtained of the atomic arrano'ement of
some few of the simplest inorganic bodies, and it is to be hoped that ere long
chemists will recognise the importance of examining the constitution of salts with

the aid of the principles established in organic chemistry.

    The foundation is already laid by our knowledge of the constitution of such
compounds as

                                         HOH, HOK, HONH,, HONO,

                                 HOPbOH, HOPbONO,, HOCOK, HOSOfI

                                                                      O 0,

and there is a strong probability regarding the atomic constitution of many other
water compounds, cy. SO.H^ + H^O = OS(OH),, SO5H, + H^O = S(OH)g.

     Amongst the extensions of our means of examining the physical properties of
matter, and thereby discovering new varieties of matter for chemical investigation

spectrum analysis has played an important part, and is no doubt destined to'do far

more. It has already led chemists to the discovery of several previously unknown

elements, and has led to the detection of various known elements in distant masses
of which we had previously no chemical knowledge.

Up to this point the growth of the atomic theory will be seen, from the general
outline which I have endeavoured to trace, to have consisted mainly in the more
and more full and exact identification of each elementary atom, and in the accu-
Amulation of more and more varied and accurate evidences of its functions in
relation to other atoms.                       step was made towards a knowledge of the general

relations of atoms to one another by their preliminary classification according to

their best-known values.

     But a far greater step has been more recently made, one which is evidently
destined to lead to most important results.

It was discovered that if we arrange the elements in the empirical order of their

respective atomic weights, beginning with hydrogen and proceeding thence step by
step to the heaviest atom, we have before us a natural series with periodically

recurrent changes in the chemical and pliysical functions of it.s members.

Of course the series is imperfect, and exhibits gaps and irregularities                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but what

view of natural order has been complete in its infancy ?

Some of the gaps have already been filled up by the discovery of elements
possessmg the anticipated properties. The generalisation affords a brilliant addition

to the previous corroborations of the reality of the units of matter which chemists
have discovered.

Chemists have as yet taken but little account of atomic motion; althou"-h
the most perfect explanation of a chemical reaction consists of a statement of the
atomic interchange which takes place between two molecules ;
mutual combination between the atoms in one molecule.                                     or the chano°-e                                                                                                                                                                                 of

exerting great force by their r.ombination are those which can undergo a great
diminution of the velocity of their internal motions, and reciprocally.

     The force of chemical combination is evidently a function of atomic motion.
     It has been shown that the relative velocities of certain atomic interchanges
afford a measure of the amount of chemical action between two substances ; but a
vast amount of work will doubtless be required to develop the atomic theory to

the point of explaining the force of chemical action in precise terms of atomic
motion.

     The general terms of chemistry are mere symbols. Each of them serves to
recall a group (usually a very large group) of facts established by observation.
The explanation of each term is afforded by a careful study of the facts which it

is used to denote; and, accordingly, a chain of evidence involving the use of
chemical terms can be fully understood only by chemists accustomed to the con-

sideration of such evidence. The general outline of it may perhaps be to some

general thinkers of sufficient interest to attract them to further study of our science.

                   By Professor T. E. Thorpe, Ph.B., F.E.8.

     The author drew attention to the extremely rare instances of such action
hitherto observed, showing how many of these might be explained on the sup-
position that combination actually occurred between the bodies, either in solution

or in a state of gas. He illustrated his subject by experiments on the formation

of several compounds by bringing together the components in their solid form,
choosing as examples such as would manifest the change by characteristic colours.
After a short reference to a memoir of Professor Spring, he said one of the most
i-emarkable results obtained by the Belgian professor was the formation of coal
from peat by subjecting the latter to high pressure. Peat from Holland and
Belgium, when exposed to the pressure of six thousand atmospheres, was, according
to Spring, changed into a mass which in all physical characteristics resembled
ordinary coal. Experiments of the same kind were made by the author, but with
a negative result.

     The object of this communication was to point out certain relations between
the atomic weights of the fourteen elements occupying the first two lines of
Mendelejeff's Table. The author showed that there is not one of these atomic
weights some power of which is not a simple multiple of the corresponding power

of the atomic weight of lithium.

     The writer had visited New Zealand in December 1880, and through the kindness

 of Dr. Hector, F.R.S., head of the Colonial Museum, had been put in possession of
 much information with regard to this remarkable district. From the active
 volcano Tongariro, in the centre of the North Island, three 'lines of fire' could be
traced in a N.E. direction, ending at White Island, in the Bay of Plenty. Super-
 ficially the district consisted chiefly of post-tertiarj' sedimentary deposits and acid
 volcanic rocks. Lake Taupo, 248 miles' area, 1,250 feet above sea-level, but whose
 bottom was below sea-level, was the chief soiu'ce of water in the whole region,
 and it had probably subterranean outlets.

6. On Manganese Nodules, and their Occurrence on the Sea-hottom.
                             By J. Y. Buchanan.

     The specimens exhibited consist of two nodules fi-om the South Pacific and of

several from Loch Fyne in Scotland, a number of manganiferous worm-tubes and

two samples of the mud in which these tubes and nodules are found in Loch Fyne.
I have besides some very curious specimens of cobalt nodules from New Caledonia,
which I owe to the kindness of my friend Professor Liversidge, of the University of
Sydney. These have come into my hands only within the last few days and I
exhibit them as curiosities which may have an interest for some of the members

present.

    My method of dredging for mud consists in anchoring the vessel by a dredge in

tlie form of a Trotman's anchor, which carries a frame instead of a bar connecting

the flukes. To this frame is lashed a bag which receives the mud which might

otherwise drop ofi" the anchor on heaving up. This method has proved successful

in two ways: first, by keeping the vessel stationary while the anchor is down, and
so admitting of temperatui'e-observations being made and water samples being

collected without having to resort to troublesome manoeuvres; and, secondly, by

bringing up a large specimen of the mud taken, not from the soft surface layer, as

is the case with the flat dredge, but from the underlying and stiffer material.

My first and best haul of manganese nodules, however, was brought up on an

A·ordinary kedge anchor and adhering to its flukes.  portion of this mud is exhi-

bited. It is from the deepest part of Loch Fyne, between Tarbert and Skate

Island. It was described in ' Nature ' of October 10, 1878. I have never succeeded

in getting mud so rich in nodules again. Part of it when sifted was found to

consist of 30 per cent, manganese nodides, 7"6 per cent, shells, and 62-5 per cent, of

sandy clay. I doubt very much if even the richest bottom in the Pacific contains

a like proportion. The other two samples of nodule-bearing mud are, as nearly

as possible, from the same locality ; but though they contain plenty of nodules,
these nodules are of a smaller average size, and are present in much smaller propor-
tion to the rest of the mud. Of the nodules collected on the first occasion, in 1878,
the average weight was 1'7 grammes ; of those collected last July the average

weight, after eliminating all that passed through a sieve of four meshes to the

inch, was only 0'42 grammes, and the proportion of nodules to mud would cer-
tainly not be more than 5 per cent. The whole of the mud which came up on

this occasion was sifted, with the exception of a small sample dried as it was

the nodules were then sorted by sieves of diflPerent degi-ees of fineness. The bulk
of them were retained by a ^-inch mesh. The nodules so retained weighed 307
^·ammes, and numbered 726, and it is remarkable that besides these nodules there
was nothing on the sieve but a few fragments of shell and ttvo pebbles. This aflbrds

very strong evidence that the nodides are formed in situ, and cannot have been
washed into their present position, as in that case they woidd certainly have been
accompanied by pebbles.

     Hitherto the deep portion of Loch Fyne above alluded to is the only
locality in Scottish waters where I have found the oxide of manganese occiu*-
ring as nodules. It is, however, widely distributed, encrusting shells and as worm-

tubes, notably in the channel between Garvelloch Islands and the Island of Scarba
and in Loch Sunart, Similarly during the cruise of the Challenger, besides the

many locaUties where the nodules abounded, it was constantly found encrusting

shells in calcareous bottoms which were devoid of nodules.
     The Loch Fyne nodules i-esemble the oceanic ones in nearly every particular.

They are comparatively soft when first brought up, and become harder when

exposed to the air. Heated in the closed tube they give ofi" water charged with

ammonia and empyreimiatic products. When treated with hydrochloric acid the

soluble constituents are removed, and what remains behind includes the insoluble

constituents of the surrounding mud. Many of the Loch Fyne nodides have soft

kernels, which are richer in oxide of manganese than the rinds.

   A considerable number of determinations have been made, both of the available

oxygen and of the manganese ; and if the manganese found be united to the whole
584 REPORT-- 1881.

of the available oxygen, the resulting formula varies between MnOj.5 and MnOj.g..
Taking the soft kernel alone, separated from the more sandy rind, the formula is
MnOj.,5. The rind alone had the formula MnO,.5. In some oceanic nodules
which were examined, the formida varied from MnOi-gg to MnOj.gj.

     Some of the mud which contained the Loch Fyne nodules was examined. It
contained 0-71 per cent, of MnO, and a hardly distinguishable trace of extra oxygen.

     If we express the available "oxygen in terms of its equivalent Mn02 we have in
oceanic nodules from 22 to 32 per cent., in Loch Fyne ones from 13 to 22, and in

the kernel treated separately 33 per cent, of MnOj.
      The insoluble residue varies in oceanic nodules from 16 to 30 per cent., and in.

the Loch Fyne ones from 28 to 33 per cent., both containing from 83 to 88 per

cent, of silica.

     Oceanic nodules appear to contain more nickel and cobalt than the Ijoch Fyne
ones, while the latter contain distinct traces of copper, which does not appear to be
so common in the oceanic ones.

     With regard to the method of formation of these nodules, and the deposition of

higher oxides, not only of manganese but of iron, on the sea-bottom, it is perhaps
unwise at the present moment to speak positively ; but I think there is enough

known to enable us to indicate a probable process of production.
     All the nodules without exception contain residues of organic matter ; where

the oxide of manganese is not aggregated into nodules, it is found encrusting
animal remains, as shells, worm-tubes, &c. Whether in the form of nodules or

incrustations, the black matter contains all the recognisable sand and other matter

of the surrounding mud ; moreover, they are certainly formed in situ, and not
brought from a distance. The mud in Loch Fyne, at any rate, contains manga-

nese in the form of protoxide, and no doubt as silicates ; it also contains oxides of
iron, which are present in all manganese nodules and incrustations indeed in the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

same dredgeful we can pick out all gradations of nodules, from those which con-
tain almost exclusively MnO^, with only traces of Fe^Oj, to those which contain

FegOj, without any INInO,,.

    The formation of the sesquioxide of iron nodules has gone on under my own

eyes. In July 1879 I dredged from the bottom of the Sound of Jura, in 70 to 80
fathoms, a large mass of veiy stifl" blue clay, as stiif as the best brick-making clay.
Throughout the mass there were disseminated patches and pockets of blackish blue
matter which proved to be sulphide of iron ; hydrochloric acid liberatmg sul-
phuretted hydrogen in abundance. This was dried in the usual way, in plates on
the cylinder covers of the engine, and when dry not a trace of sulphide was to be

found, every black patch being now represented by a reddisli-brown one, even in
the centre of large and compact masses. Now, what has here taken place in a very

short time, under the combined action of air, moisture, and heat, takes place as

surely, but more slowly, in the surface layer of the mud at the bottom and, in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .;

point of fact, not only in our shallow seas, but even in the deepest water of the

ocean, we find the surface layer of the mud almost invariably of a different colour
from the underlying mass, the top being red while below the mud is grey. I believe,
then, that for the formation of the nodules we have to look to the organic world as

a necessary though indirect assistant. The decomposition of animal matter in
presence of the sulphates of the sea-water, reduces these to sulphides, which in theu-
turn react on the iron and manganese minerals (principally silicates) in the mud,,
forming sidphides of these metals. As the organic matter gets exhausted, these
sulphides are oxidised to oxides by the oxygen of the water, forming concretions or
incrustations of the ochreous oxides, which naturally also enclose the other and
unaltered constituents of the mud.

      In conclusion, I cannot help thinking that the shell-producing animals of the

sea obtain the lime from the sea-water in this way, the hme being assimilated,

from the dissolved sulphate, in the form of sulphide in the interior of the animal,
and transformed into carbonate on the outside.

              6. On Brewing in Japan.

By Professor R. W. Atkinson, B.Sc. {Loyid.).

The Japanese brewing process is divided into two parts, comparable with the

malting and brewing processes of beer-making. The preparation and properties

of the diastatic material are, however, diU'erent, for whilst malt-extract hydrates

cane-sugar, dextrin, and starch, the Japanese kcji hydrates maltose in addition, so

that the ultimate products of its action upon starch-paste are dextrose and dextrin,

or even the former alone. It further difiers from malt in the fact that its solution

is rendered inactive by heat at a lower temperature, about 70° 0., and also by the

manner of its formation. Unlike malt, the active properties of hoji are not due to

the growth of the embryo, because tbe embryos are broken away by rough treat-

ment, but by the growth over the steamed and cooled grains of rice of the mycelium

of a fiuagus, the result of which is to burn away a good deal of the carbon and

hydrogen of the rice, much heat being liberated, and to render soluble the pre-

viously insoluble albuminoid matter.

The brewing process proper is divided into two stages, the first stage being

intended to prepare an actively growing yeast, the germs of which are sown

Aspontaneously in the mash.  mixture of steamed-rice, kdji, and water is allowed

to remain in shallow tubs at a low temperature (0°-5° 0.) until quite liquid, after

which it is heated, fermentation setting in inunediately and continuing until

nearly all the dextrose first formed is exhausted. This product is now used like

yeast, and is added to fresh quantities of steamed-rice, Iwji, and water, fermenta-

tion proceeding actively until the percentage of alcohol amounts to about 13 or

14 per cent, by weight. The conversion of starch into sugar and of the latter into

alcohol go on concurrently, the diastase of the kdji transforming the starch

throughout the whole process. After the greater part of the rice added has been

used up the mash is filtered, clarified by standing, and when summer approaches,

and signs of putrefactive fernientation appear, the sake is heated in iron vessels,

an operation which preserves it for a time. No precautions being taken against

the reintroduction of disease-germs, the heating process must be repeated about

once a month throughout the siunmer.

Analyses of various specimens, fresh and diseased, are given in the paper.

      7. On Peppermint-camphor (Menthol) and some of its Derivatives.

      By Professor R. W. Atkinson, B.Sc. (Land.), and H. Toshiba.

     Determinations of some of the physical constants of menthol, menthone, men-

thene, and a hydrocarbon obtained by the action of hydric iodide upon menthol,

with subsequent decomposition by caustic soda and metallic sodium, have been

made.

(96%), chloroform, benzene, and carbon disulphide, was found to be -- 59-92° + 0'2.
The number obtained for its optical activity in glacial acetic acid was much lower
--i.e. 54-28°. All the above values express the specific rotatory power of menthol,

independent of solvents. Menthol regenerated from its ketone has a specific

Its specific rotatory power is + 21*16°. Its specific gravity at 0°0. is 0-9126,
and the specific gravities and volumes at higher temperatures are given in the
paper. Ihe molecular refraction was found to be 75'3, that calculated from

was foimd to be 74-045, which indicates that two carbon atoms are doubly com-

bined, the calculated number in that case being 73'82. Menthene combines with
fuming hydric chloride, forming a slightly yellow oil, C'HjgGl.

   --Hydrocarbon. C'^Hi,,. This is the principal product found by cohobating

menthol with a strong solution of hydric iodide, boiling with caustic soda, and
finally digesting with sodium. It boils at 168'6° (corr.), but analysis showed
that it still retained traces of menthene, which appears to be found in the same
reaction. The specific gravities and volumes at different temperatures are given
in the original paper, the specific gravity at 0° being 0-8263. The specific rotatory
power was 6'2° for the transition tint. The molecular refraction was 73'28, the
calculated value for four atoms of carbon doubly combined, being 73'24.

     Remarks are made upon the difficulties met with in determining the specific
volumes of the above compounds, and the paper concludes with a discussion of the
probable constitution of menthol and its derivatives, in which the resemblance
between camphor and mentbone is pointed out.

8. On the Sodlwn-alum of Japan. By Professor Edward Divers, M.D.

     The mineral sodium alum, since called Mendozite, was described by Thomson
in 1828, as occurring in South America (St. Juan, near Mendoza). Its occurrence

has not been noticed elsewhere.
     Eammelsberg ('Mineral. Ohemie') gives a series of percentages as obtained by

Thomson, and refers them to an alum vrith twenty molecules of water. Dana
(' System of Mineralogy gives a different series as obtained by Thomson, and

                                                                               ')

refers them to an alum with twenty-two molecules of water.

    My late assistant, Mr. J. Mori, once a pupil of the Royal College of Chemistry,

South Kensington, analysed the specimen I have now to describe, and obtained the

following results :

                        Found              Calculated for

                     - 100-00       10000

     The soda is too high, else the results are most satisfactory, but error in excess
here is probable from imperfect ignition to expel ammonium sulphate. Thomson
found 7-96 soda, whereas for 22 Aq. alum only 7-1 are required. Potash is absent
and only traces of iron, calcium, and insoluble matter are present.

     Sodium-alum, therefore, occurs in nature of the normal type, with twenty-

four molecules of water.
     It occm-s as an efflorescence on decomposing sodium (albite) felsite, with pyrites

scattered through it. It is found in the province of Idzumo, in the prefecture of
Shiman^, Japan, not far from the coast. Like that examined by Thomson, it is

not produced by a solfatara, though Shiman^, like many parts of Japan, includes
such. The alum is said to be obtainable in considerable quantity ; but as a second
parcel forwarded to me was damaged in transit by the leakage of bottles of natural

--alum-water I have only been able to examine very small specimens as yet.
     It occurs in two forms one massive, finely fibrous, greyish white, translucent
and also in friable opaque tears, slightly coloured by iron hydrate or oxide.

one of my pupils, has also found more than traces of tellm-ium. Arsenic is also

present in quantity.

   A former pupil of mine, Mr. Nakagawa, now a chemical engineer in the

Imperial Mint, states that the flue-deposits of the sulphur burners are rich in

tselenium.

I had hoped to have obtained by this time fuller particulars, but have been

disappointed by not receiving in time supplies of acid and flue-dust. I must, there-

fore, limit my communication to the announcement of the presence of these two

elements in Japanese sulphuric acid, and of the probable occurrence of material

Aquantities of selenium in Japan.                                                                   fm-ther communication will be published when

particulars have been ascertained.

10. On the Chrome Iron Ore of Japan. By Professor Edward Divers, M.D.

The serpentine rocks of Japan, like those found elsewhere, contain small quan-

tities of  chrome iron oxide                                                                        but a few years  ago  masses of this mineral were sent
                                                                                                 ;

from Oita prefecture (Bungo) to the Tokiyo Industrial Exhibition, and its nature

then recognised. It has lately been analysed in the laboratory of the Imperial

College of Engineering, Tokiyo, by my former pupil, Mr. T. Haga, now one of the

instructors in chemistry in the College.

It is massive, has a specific gravity 4*50, and a hardness 5"5, and is of a grey-

black colour without any shade of brown, except where weathered. Its fracture is

partly slaty, partly crystalline, showing numerous large faces inchned at aU angles.

Its lustre is resinous to sub-metallic, so that in appearance it is much like coal. Its

powder is brown. Besides brown and green coatings on the faces of natural fractures
in the mass, there are many small deposits of a greyish pink, but nearly white, soft

and unctuous mineral. The behaviour of this chrome iron oxide to heat, presents

nothing needing to be recorded, beyond that it slowly gains in weight. It contains

only traces of magnetic matter.

Reduced to very fine powder and heated for three hours with hydrochloric

acid, 2-53-2*87 per cent, dissolve, which together with some of the silica in the

ore, make perhaps 4 per cent, decomposed. The soluble part has been separately

analysed. An analysis of the soft white matter has also been made, but the portion

of this which could be got was very small, and largely mixed with the chrome iron

oxide. The following are the results of analyses :

                                                                                                    I. The whole ore, air-dried.

     This leaves 0'88 for water (undetermined because of the difficulty arising from

the already noted absorption of oxygen), additional oxygen if present, and other

     This analysis was made by Mr. Kawakita, another of the instructors, in the
unavoidable absence of Mr. Haga.

     The tabular statement of the composition of the ore shows that it is in almost
exact agreement with that of pure ferrous chromite, as regards the ratio of iron

oxide to chromium oxide. No such pure ore has hitherto been recorded as occur-

ring, I beheve, unless possibly in the papers of Christomanos, which I have only
seen in abstracts. The insolubility of the iron in acids, and its non-magnetic
character, prove that it is really combined as chromite. There remains the mag-

nesia to account for. This cannot be in the free state, for not only is the occurrence

of free magnesia in nature unknown and improbable, but in this mineral the mag-
nesia, like the iron oxide, is for the most part insoluble in acid. From the abstracts
(' Jom-n. Chem. Soc.,' xxxii.) of his papers, I learn that Christomanos in one paper
asserts that pure chromite is always FeCroO^, and all other constituents of the ore
part of the matrix, and in another paper admits the existence of compounds of

ferrous oxide with chromic oxide in three proportions, other than that of the ordi-
nary spinel type. I see nothing for the case of the Oita ore but to accept the view
that the magnesia is a chemical part of it, the proportion of which, after deducting

soluble magnesia, is almost exactly that required by the formula, MgO, 2FeO, 2Cr303,

corresponding to the 3FeO, 2Cr203 of Christomanos.

     The visible presence of the white mineral, and the magnetic character of a very
minute part of the powdered mineral, serve to confirm the propriety of the above

arrangement.

     The estimation of chromium and iron was made by the usual volumetric methods.
To bring the ore into a soluble condition, Dittmar's method was employed, this
method being very satisfactory, and, in Mr. Haga's hands, much easier than

described in Dingl.

     Fused borax, 2 parts, and dry potassium sodium carbonate, 3 parts, were fused
together in a platinum crucible till effervescence ceased, and the whole cooled.
About 1 part of very finely-powdered, ore was then placed on the top, and the

crucible covered and slowly heated to fusion. When the powder had become

moistened with the melted flux, the lid was removed and the crucible kept at a red
heat by a Bunsen flame. The liqiud mass was occasionally stirred with a small

platinum spatula. When particles of ore were no longer visible in the mass adhering

to the spatula, the heat was maintained for only a few minutes longer, and the
crucible then quickly cooled, to favour the detachment of the mass. One hour was
suflacient for one gram of ore, and half-an-hour for half a gram. In this time,

indeed, all the chromium may not have become chromate, but it will be all soluble

                                                                                              I

in acid. Should the time have been too short, particles of ore will be visible in the

bottom of the fused mass after removal from the crucible, and the mass must then

be replaced and agam heated. Unless the time of heating has been prolonged, it is

safer to dissolve all up in sulphuric acid, oxidise with a few drops of permanganate

solution any unoxidised chromium salt, and remove excess of permanganate by
Asodium carbonate and alcohol.

     The mode in which the experiments were conducted was by sealing up fifteen
different metals in carbon disulphide, and carefully examining them with the
Tnicroscope. The tubes exhibited were put up on June 20, 1879, examined on
June 20, 1880, and in May, 1881, transparent crystals were found in those which
contained gold, antimony, and bismuth.

    4. On the Separation of Hydrocarhon Oils from Fat Oils}
                    By Alfred H. Allen, F.C.S.

The extensive production of various hydrocarbon oils suitable for lubricating

purposes, together with their low price, has resulted in their being largely employed

for the adulteration of animal and vegetable oils. The hydrocarbons most com-
monly employed for such purposes are

1. Oils produced by the distillation of petroleum and bituminous shale, having

a density usually ranging between "870 and "915.

     2. Oils produced by the distillation of common rosin, having a density of "965
and upwards.

3.  Neutral  coal-oil                                    being  the  portion  of  the  products  of the                       distillation of
                                                      ;

coal-tar boiling at about 200°C., and freed from phenols by treatment with soda.

4. Solid -paraffin ; used for the adulteration of bees' wax and spermaceti, and

·employed in admixture with stearic acid for making candles.

The methods for the detection of hydrocarbon oils in fat oils are based on

the density of the  sample                               the lowered ^flashing and boiling  points                            the fluorescent

the oil by alkalies. The taste of the oil and its odour on heating are also useful

indications.

     If undoubtedly fluorescent, an oil certainly contains a mixture of some hydro-

carbon ; but the converse is not strictly true, as the fluorescence of some varieties
of mineral oil can be destroyed by chemical treatment, and in other cases
fluorescence is wholly wanting. Still by far the greater number of hydrocarbon
oils employed for lubricating purposes are strongly fluorescent, and the remainder
usually become so on treatment with an equal measure of strong sulphuric acid.

     The best and most accm-ate method of detecting hydrocarbon oils in, and quan-
titatively separating them from, fat oils, is to saponify the sample and then agitate
the aqueous solution of the soap with ether. On separating the ethereal layer, and
evaporating it at or below a steam heat, the hydrocarbon oil is obtained in a state
of purity. The agitation with ether must be repeated several times to eflfect a
complete extraction of the hydrocarbon oil from the soap solution.

     The author has proved the accuracy of this process when applied to various
mixtures of fat oils with hydrocarbon oils. The results obtained are correct to
within about 1 per cent, in aU ordinaiy cases. In cases where extreme accuracy
is desired it is necessary to remember that most, if not all, animal and vegetable
oils contain traces of matter wholly unacted on by alkalies. In certain cases, as
butter and cod-liver oil, this matter consists largely of cholesterin. The proportion
of unsaponifiable matter soluble in ether, which is naturally present in fixed oil.*
and fats, rarely exceeds 1^ per cent., and is usually much less. Sperm oil, however,
constitutes an exception, yielding by the process about 40 per cent, of matter
soluble in ether, the nature of which is undergoing further examination.

     The foUowino- table indicates the general behaviour of the constituents of
complex fats, oils, and waxes, when the aqueous solution of the saponified sub-

stance is shaken with ether :

5. On some Tlienomena wliich appear to he of the Nature of Chemico-
               Magnetic Action. By William Thomson, F.B.8.E.

Some time ao'o I observed that the colour of a piece of prussian-blue cloth had

been dischar'i-ed in the vicinity of a piece of iron which was lying in contact with
it and thinking this action to be of the nature of magnetic, I made some experi-
ments to learn something respecting it. I laid a piece of glass on a piece of wet
·nrussian-blue cloth, and left it there for many weeks ; the eflPect was that the cloth

under the "-lass had apparently become rather darker in colour than the original
cloth but of this I was not quite certain, whilst the uncovered cloth was slightly
bleached. The same effect was produced by laying a sheet of platinum on the wet
blue cloth and no blue colour was communicated to the wet blotting-paper on
which they lay. These experiments proved that the colour of the cloth was not

influenced by capillary action.  laid  on       _  oi  the prussi. an-ib.,lue   wt.    wi-t.vh,  t.^he

result that the colour of the cloth on each side of the pieces of iron was completely

discharged, and the colour so abstracted was arranged in deeply coloured lines, run-

ning in a semicircle from each end of the iron, and surrounding the semicircles

of bleached cloth on each side of the bar. When the blue cloth with the piece of

iron on it rested on several folds of wet blotting-paper, the insoluble blue colouring

matter was disti-ibuted on and through the blotting paper in lines which were

more distinct and delicate than those oa the cloth itself. These lines of colour were

evidently formed under the influence of some force of the nature of magnetism.

Small horse-shoe magnets were laid on the wet blue cloth, resting on wet

blotting-paper, and well-curved lines of coloiu-, usually more or less circular, were

developed from the poles and      from  other  parts  of  the magnets                                                                                                        some parts of the
                                                                                                                              ;

cloth, usually in the vicinity of the poles, being bleached, and the colour so removed

deposited in lines around the bleached portion.

     This action, I found, was not a purely magnetic one, because on placing a piece
of gutta-percha tissue over the wet blue cloth, and a magnet on the top of the
gutta-percha, so as to prevent it from coming in actual contact with the wet cloth,
no effect of any kind was produced after many weeks.

     I next tried the efiect of laying a horse-shoe magnet on a piece of wet cotton
cloth dyed with aniline, and found that most of the colour was swept away in a
semicircle in front of the poles, and it appeared as if the colour had been swept
away from the south pole and deposited around the arc of the circle runnino- from
the north pole. Thus it is clear that a force of the nature of magnetism is capable

of acting on aniline colour under certain conditions.

    To find the action of a current of electricity on the prussian-blue colour, I placed
some of the wet cloth on wet blotting-paper, and laid upon the cloth two platinum

electrodes connected with a Leclanche battery ; the current was allowed to pass

during several days, and the result was that the colour imder both electrodes was

slightly bleached, but  more  so  under the one than the other                                                                                                               whilst  one, and only
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

one, line of colour along the outside of one of the electrodes, was transfen-ed to
and penetrated six sheets of blotting-paper underneath.

Lastly, a strip of copper was laid on the prussian-blue cloth, and a weak current

of electricity passed through it, to find what action the forces aldn to magnetic,
which surroimd the current, would have on the colour. The copper seemed to
decompose the prussian-blue underneath it, producing prussiate of copper, which
was transferred to the blotting-paper ; but the most remarkable result was that
some of the imdecomposed blue colour was transferred to the blotting-paper in a
broad, faint band (along one side only), about half-an-inch from the copper band.

6. On file Specific Refraction and Dispersion of Light hy Liqtdds.
                   By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.B.S.

    The general conclusions arrived at from observations made on a large number of

liquids were as follows :

1. The original statement of the Eev. T. P. Dale and the author, that the length

Aof the spectrum (the difference between the refraction of the lines                                                                                                                 and H)

decreases with elevation of temperature, is fully confirmed.

2. The original statement that this length of spectrum divided by the density

/ Mir f^A \ jg jigai-iy^ ijut not exactly, a constant at different temperatures, seems

to be confirmed by more careful experiments.

      3. It seems to be the general rule that this specific dispersion slightly diminishes
\vith increase of temperature.

     4. This specific dispersion is very notably affected by the constitution of the
compound body. Thus among hydrocarbons, the change of the refraction-equivalent
of the carbon from 5-0 to 6-1 or 8-8, reveals itself by a change in the specific disper-
sion far greater proportionally than that in the specific refraction.

     5. AVhile the specific refraction of a compound is the mean of the specific
refractions of its constituents, no such simple law holds good with respect to specific

dispersion.

              7. On Moleadar Attraction} By F. D. Brown, B.Sc.

     It is generally asserted by chemists that, when two or more elements combine
together to form a compound body, the forces of chemical affinity brought into play
are entirely neutralised by the act of combination. In this important respect, there-
fore, affinity is assumed to differ from gravitation where no neutralisation or
diminution of the attractive force results from the contiguity of two masses of
matter. The mere fact that chemical reactions take place, involving as they do the
interaction of atoms forming part of dissimilar molecules, shows that this assump-

tion of complete neutralisation is inconsistent with fact.

    If we go to the other extreme, and say that the act of combination produces no

change whatever in the chemical forces, but that the same attraction is excited
between any given pair of atoms, without regard to the state of combination of one

or both of the atoms, we are not only able to give a reasonable account of the

occurrence of chemical reactions, and to assert that there is nothing very remarkable

in the existence of molecular combinations, but we are also provided with a more or

less effective explanation of the relative volatility of substances.

     Let (»· s) equal the attraction at unit distance exerted between any two atoms
II and S ; it is clear that the attraction between two contiguous molecules, each
containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, will be expressed as follows:

                          A(co) + B(cA) + C(ct') + D(o/0 + E(AA) + Yipo),

whence A, B, 0, &c. are functions of the number and position of the corresponding
atoms. Applying this general equation, as best we can, to actual cases, and espe-
cially to those cases which admit of a tolerably general statement, we find that the

inter-molecular attraction should be greater in an acid than in the corresponding
alcohol, greater in an alcohol of high molecular weight than in a homologous one of
which the molecule is less complex, greater in a primary alcohol than in its secondary

or tertiary isomer, generally greater in a chlorinated compound than in the corre-
sponding substance containing hydrogen, and so on. If we allow that the Tolatility
of a substance is in some sense a measure of the forces of attraction between the
molecules, we must admit that the boiling points of the compounds of organic
chemistry would lead us to infer with much reason that the above expression rightly
represents the value of the inter-molecular attraction. The study of the latent heat
of vaporisation of many of the carbon compounds would seem, from this point of
view, to offer considerable chances of advancing the solution of the problem of

chemical affinity.

8. Note on a netv method of Measuring certain Cliemical Affinities.

                          By Alfred Tribe, F.O.S.

   --When a metal is immersed in an electrolytic field i.e. in an electrolyte in the
--act of electrolysis and the electromotive force set up on any part of its surface

suffices to overcome the affinities of the radicals of the medium, the positive ion

separates on that part of the surface which may be supposed to have received

-- electrification, and the negative ion on that part which receives + electrification.

    When the metal is in the form of a rectangular plate, and placed so that the
lines of force are perpendicular to its surface, the maximum electro-motive force

set up is on the central parts of such a plate, becoming less towards the edges,

where, and for some little distance from which, it is insufficient to initiate electro-

chemical action.

      "\^Tien the plate is placed in the electrolytic field so that the lines of force are

parallel with one of its edges, the maximum electro-motive force is on the end of

the plate, becoming less and less towards the central parts until it no longer suffices

to bring about electro-chemical action. This is denoted by the boundaries of the

Adeposits, which in many cases are very sharply defined.  plate, in fact, in the

position just named, may be regai'ded, in so far as electrical power is concerned, as

 the electro-molive force of wliicli is just incapable of resolving- tlie electrolyte into
 its constituent ions.

      The very intimate relation between E.M.F. and Chemical Affinity was a lono-

 time ap:o pointed out hy Sir W. Thomson, and recently in an elaborate research by

 Dr. Wright, and it therefore was anticipated tJiat if, in a series of trials, the
 chemical affinities were altered, while other circumstances remained the same, the
 magnitiide of the intei'medial space between the boundaries of the electro-deposits
 would increase along with the force required to overcome the affinities of the ions

 of the electrolyte.

     _A series of experiments with molecular solutions of the chloride, bromide, and
 iodide of zinc, with rectangular plates or analysers of silver, copper, iron, and zinc
showed that this is the case--1>. the interuiedial space with the chloride was
 greatest, the bromide less, and the iodide least. Another series, with silver analysers,
but with molecular solutions of the sulphates of zinc and copper, showed that the

intermedial space in the case of the zinc sulphate was much tlie greater. Again,
another series with zinc sulphate, showed that a zinc analyser gave the least inter-

medial space, iron greater, copper greater still, and silver most of all.

     This method affords a simple means of demonstrating differences of chemical
affinity, but whether it is capable of giving more than approximative measurements
will require further investigation to determine. In some cases secondary actions
are of course set up, so that the intermedial space would represent the initial

electro-motive force + or - any interfering E.M. forces. Gould, however, the

difference of potential be determined between the boundaries of the electro-deposits,
data would be furnished for calculating the chemical attractions overcome, or at
least the work-equivalent of the net chemical actions involved.

     The object of this communication was to draw the attention of chemists to some
of the discrepancies which have of late years sprung up in the principles upon
which the names of chemical compounds are framed; to consider in what respects
one of the principles adopted excels the other ; and the importance of doino- any-
thing which may be possible to remedy the confusion which is being introduced

                              By R. Waeington, F.C.8.

The earlier researches on nitrification conducted in the Rothamsted Laboratory
have been already communicated to the Chemical Society. In the second commu-
nication ('Trans. Chem. Soc.,' 1879) some experiments were described (6th series,
p. 451) in which a solution of chloride of ammonium, containing the usual nutritive
ingredients, was seeded from an old solution which had some months before under-
gone

been made on the conditions which respectively determine the formation of nitric
and nitrous acid

rature low ; this is the case, for instance, when 80 millia-rams of chloride of ammo-
nium are present in one litre, the column of the liquid four or five inches in depth,

and the temperature about 15° C. Under such circumstances only a trace of
nitrous acid is formed, and this changes into nitric acid before the conclusion of the
action. If the solutions employed are much more concentrated, or the temperature

is considerably raised, large quantities of nitrous acid are produced ; this formation

of nitrous acid may be avoided to a great extent by diminishing the depth of the

solution, l)ut at the temperature of 30° it is very difficult to avoid the foi'mation of

considerable quantities of nitrous acid, even with small depths of solution. In all

cases in whicli soil has been used as seed, the nitrous acid formed exists only
temporarily in the solution, the final product of the fermentation being always

nitric acid.

     Soil added to a solution of nitrite of potassium, supplied with nutritive ingre-

dients, readily converts the nitrite into nitrate.

    When solutions, whicli have been seeded with soil and undergone the nitric

fermentation, are themselves employed as seed for new solutions of ammonia, the
final result as before is nitric acid ; but this is apparently true only when the solu-
tion used as seed is not at most more than a few months old ; beyond this age the

result of the fermentation is apparently only nitrous acid, and this nitrous acid does
not further change into nitric, even in several years, unless a certain visible change
occurs in the solution to be presently mentioned. AVhen a solution which has
undergone this nitrous fermentation is used as seed, it again produces a purely
nitrous fermentation, the nitrous acid being constant as before. The iritrous ferment
just described is without effect on nitrite of potassium.

     The results just mentioned are perfectly in accordance with the facts recently
published by Pasteur, who finds that by allowing the cultivation of an organism
(as that producing chicken cholera) to become old, an organism is obtained of
diminished energ;y, which when cultivated continues to produce organisms of the

same diminished energy.

If solutions which have nitrified are kept for a considerable time, a white

organism not unfrequently appears in spots on the surface of the liquid, and under

favourable conditions spreads over the whole surface. Viewed by a lens it appears

as a mass of interlaced fibres. This organism has been examined microscopically

by Dr. M. Masters, F.R.S., and more fully by Professor E. Ray Lankester ; both

pronounce it to be a bacterium. Wherever this surface organism appears, any

nitrites that may be present are speedily converted into nitrates; a solution of

nitrite of potassium is also speedily converted into nitrate. The experiments as yet

made with this organism leave it doubtful whether it has any power of oxidising

ammonia                                        this part of the subject requires, however, further investigation.  There
                                            ;

can be little doubt that this surface organism is a stage in the development of the

nitrifyiiig ferment.

     The nitrifying ferment appears capable of existing in two, or perhaps three, con-

ditions, producing definite chemical eflects :

    1. Tlie nitric ferment of soil, which converts both ammonium salts and nitrites

into nitrates.

    !^. The altered ferment, which converts ammonium salts into nitrites, but fails

to change nitrites into nitrates.
     3. The surface organism, which changes nitrites into nitrates.

                3. On the Effect of the Specfmim of Silver GhloHde.
                            By Captain Abnet, E.E., F.R.8.

    In all works with which the author is acquainted, the maximum intensity of the

spectrum impressed on silver chloride is shown as situated in the indigo portion of
the spectrum. Owing to a recent investigation by Dr. Eder, of Vienna, the possi-
bility of developing an image on silver chloride by the alkaline developer, and by a
ferrous citrate developer, has become practicable. The old method of developing
by means of acid solutions was misatisfactory and tended to give false impressions.
The author experimented with chloride of silver prepared as an emulsion in gelatine..
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 15.                                                                                               595

Plates were prepared with this emulsion: in one case the silver chloride was modi-
fied in molecular structure by boiling the gelatinous solution, and in the other it
was prepared by the cold method. Sucli plates were exposed to the spectrum and
developed with a solution of hydrochloric and ammonium carbonate, and in other
cases the development was with ferrous citrate.

     The unmodified silver chloride, when examined by transmitted light, had a
very faint canary colour ; the absorption-spectrum of this was photographed, and
showed that aU the ultra-violet rays as far as II were not off", and that there was a
slight weakening of the violet and indigo rays. On the principle of work going hand
in hand with absorption, it was surmised that the rays most entirely absorbed
should give the maximum efiect when silver chloride was used as a receiving medium
for the spectrum. This was proved to be the case, the limit of maximum eflect

being about II, the sensitiveness rapidly falling to ' h,' and being still less at G.

Dr. Eder had examined the spectrum also, and found the maximum intensity in the
violet. This discrepancy may be accounted for by the fact that the author's experi-
ments were carried out in July, when the solar spectrum is very rich in ultra-violet
rays; whilst Dr. Eder's were carried out with sunlight in the winter, when those
rays were almost absent, or the spectroscope itself may be in fault.

      Experiments with the electric light gave the same results with the author as

those obtained with sunlight.

      There is a practical bearing of these experiments in photographic printing on
albumenised paper. In the process both albuminate and chloride of silver are the

media acted upon by light ; the spectrum on albuminate of silver has its maximum
in the blue near G. If, then, we have light which possesses strongly the ultra-violet
rays as well as the blue rays, we arriv-e at the fact that both the chloride and the
albuminate will be strongly acted upon. If, on the other hand, we have a winter
light, which is deficient in ultra-violet rays, we shall have the albuminate of silver
much more acted upon than the chloride. Any practical worker in photography

will have noticed that the appearance of silver prints of equal depth at the two
seasons have very different qualities in toning, and this no doubt arises from the

fact that the proportions of darkened chloride to albuminate vary veiy considerably

in the two cases; the print residting from light possessing much of the ultra-violet,
being more vigorous than that produced, say, in winter. The author has in other
papers shown that in slow printing a certain amoimt of oxidation of the altered

chloride of silver is an accompaniment, and that this produces flatness of image

when it is toned with gold ; a still further cause for the same defect, the author
believes, may be found in what he has already stated.

      The author has ' printed out ' the spectrum on chloride of silver, and finds that

the same position of maximum as that it possesses when the image is developed

 holds good.

      The author then proceeds to point out that, in actenometers based on the use of
 silver chloride, the rays measured chiefly lie in the ultra-violet region ; and he pro-
 poses to try the substitution of bromized paper for the same purpose, and to com-
pare them with the results obtained by the chloride paper.

6. Oh the Action of Zinc and Magnesium on Acidified Solutions of Ferric
             Sulphate. By Professor T. E. Thorpe, Ph.D., F.B.S.

    The extent of reduction of the ferric salt may vary with the strength of the
solution, with its temperature, with the amount of free acid present, and lastly

with the specific nature of the metal employed. The author has studied the condi-

tions under which the hydrogen does work as a reducing agent. Experiments

were made on dilute solutions of ferric sulphate, containing known quantities of

free acid. The author finds : (1) that the amount of reduction produced by a given

weight of zinc in  dissolving  increases with the  temperiiture                                                           (2)  that  it  is  also

aflPected, although to a less degree, by the initial surface of metal exposed. Whilst

the extent of reduction, as also the rapidity of solution, increase with the tempera-

ture, at a given tempei-atiire the extent of reduction increases, although at a
gradually diminishing rate, with the time of solution. The rapidity of solution
and extent of induction, produced by a given quantity of zinc of a given area and
in a solution of a given temperature and containing a definite weight of free acid,

increases v^ith the amount of reducible iron present. Experiments made by plac-

ing zinc in contact with platinum shovs-ed that, although the time of solution of
zinc in contact with platinum, is considerably diminished, as compared with that of
zinc alone, little difference in the reducing effect is observed.

     Similar results were obtained with magnesium, although the amount of reduc-
tion is from one-fourth to one-third of that produced by zinc, under similar condi-
tions. The diminution of the rate of solution with decrease in the amount of free
acid present, is far greater in the case of magnesium than in that of zinc.

     The author concludes that his experiments strongly support the view that the
reducing power of nascent hydrogen is connected with the existence of this body

in the atomic condition, since all conditions tending to prolong the duration of this
atomic condition augment the reducing power.

6. On tlie Heducing Action of Zinc and Magnesium on Vanadium Solutions.
                     By Professor H. E. RoscOE, LL.D., F.B.8.

     The object of this communication is to examine the reducing action of the
above metals upon acid Vanadic Solutions, comparing the relative amount of reduc-
tion effected by metals generally, together with the time occupied by that reduction,
other conditions remaining as nearly constant as possible. From his original
experiments on this subject the author concluded that, whilst the reduction in the
case of zinc and sodium took place from V.^Oj to V._,0o, that in the case of magnesium

only proceeded to V^Oj. This he now finds is so far not the case that the same

point is in reality reached by all three above-named metals, but that the reduction
from V0O3 to VoOo takes place with magnesium with extreme slowness. Curves
of the reduction in terms of the time are gi-\en.

7. O71 the Determination of the Relative Atomic Weiglits of Manganese,

      Oxygen, and Silver. By Professor Dewar, M.A., F.B.S., and

        A. Scott, B.A., B.Sc.

     Considerable doubt seems to exist as to whether the atomic weight of manganese
should be taken as 54 or 55. It seemed to the authors that by the use of perman-
ganate of silver this could be determined with great accuracy, as it is only needful
to assume the atomic weights of oxygen and silver, which are the two elements, the
atomic weights of which have been most accurately determined by Stas. It is an
exceedingly good substance for this purpose, as it can I'eadily be obtained in a state
of high purit}^. and can be readily weighed, as it is an anhydrous salt and is not hygro-
scopic in the slightest degree. It contains likewise manganese free from any allied

metals, and may be decomposed without the intervention of any solution. By

heating it to a temperature of about 100° to 105° it decomposes thus :

                               4AgMnO, = 2(Ag20.2]\InO.,) + SO^

     If this residue, which seems to be a comparatively stable and definite compound,
be heated in hydrogen we have this decomposition :

                        Agj02Mn02 + 3H2 = Ago + 2MnO + 3H,0.

    From these decompositions they expect very accurate results. As a further

check they dissolve the oxide of manganese out of this residue by means of dilute
sulphuric acid containing a little sulphurous acid, w^ash thoroughly and thus leave
the silver behind. The decompositions are done in a bulb of hard glass. Three
experunents, made on difierent samples of the salt, give the follomng values for
manganese, silver being taken as 108 and oxygen as 1 6.

                                                                    55-51

                                                                   54-45

     The two latter samples were the tiuest. It is evident that there is some
impurit}' contained in these samples, which were quite free Irom potash when a
quantity of 5 grams was reduced, extracted with water, and tested spectroscopically.

    To check these results two samples of black oxide of manganese, obtained by
heating the nitrate, were reduced in hydrogen to manganous oxide, and the water
collected. These gave for manganese the atomic weights of 53-6 and 53-3 respec-

tively. These are the results of preliminary experiments ; others are being carried
out with purer samples and greater accuracy.

                                F.B.S., and A. Scott, B.A., B.Sc.

      It seemed to the authors that the behaviour" of various haloid salts at high tem-
peratures would prove of great interest on account of its relation to the experiments
of Meyer and Crafts on the vapour density of chlorine at high temperatures. The
method they employed was to measiu'e the volume of gas given off from a weighed

amount of substance which was introduced in the ordinary way into an iron

apparatus in every respect the same as they used in determinhig the vapour-
densities of potassium and sodium, which is described in the ' Proc. Roy. Soc'
The residts of the experiments are calculated so as to give the amount of substance

required to expel 22-4: C. of gas at 0° + 760 mm. pressure. Commencing with iodine
they found that in an apparatus filled with hydrogen the mean result was 260, I^
being equal to 254 ; when nitrogen was used, 241 was the number found.

     Platinous chloride gave in the same way the number 251, 268 corresponding to
Clj. No free chlorine could be detected ; ferrous chloride was apparently formed
alone. Ferrous chloride was next tried and gave as a mean 116 :

                                                FeCl2 = 127.
    No absorption-spectrum could be seen, but a small quantity of free chlorine
seemed to exist in the vapour, the rest being Fed.,. Manganous chloride gave 135
while MnC1.3 = 126. Argentic chloride when introduced seemed to volatilise at
once, and on calculating gave 262 as a mean instead of 287. It, however, was

almost entirely decomposed into ferrous chloride and silver, as on blowing out the
vapour only a minute trace of silver could be found.

      With argentic iodide they got the number 428 if the iodide was first fused in
the small capsule before being introduced into the apparatus ; otherwise they got
the muuber 574, Ag^I^ corresponding to 470. In the vapour there were silver and
ferrous iodides along with free iodine ; lead chloride gave. 239, whereas PbCl, corre-

sponds to 278. On looking down the tube with the spectroscope a beautiful chan-

nelled spectrum was observed. Potassium chloride was tried, but they were never
able to raise the temperature sufficiently to volatilise this salt rapidly enough to
get good results. Potassic iodide gave as a mean 183 instead of 166. The vapours
blown out seemed to contain neither iodine nor iron, but yielded a fine white powder
of potassic iodide which had a slight acid reaction. Eubidium chloride similarly
gave 155 instead of 121.

3. Note on the Phosphates of Lime and Ammonia. By J. Alfued Wanklyn.

    When ammonia is added to a solution of the soluble phosphate of lime, a

precipitate of tribasic phosphate of lime is thrown down, and phosphate of ammonia

passes into solution.
                        ----

598 EBPORT-- 1881.

     The author has observed that re-solution of the phosphate of lime occurs when

the ammoniacal solution is heated with it in the water-hath, and that a clear viscid
solution is formed which, on cooling, solidifies and j-ields a solid, admitting of
being reduced to a fine powder. This double salt (which be believes is new) appears
to have the following formula :

                                    P^OsCaOCNHJjOjH^O + aq.

     Excess of water breaks it up. Morfit has made the interesting observation
that when tribasic phosphate of lime (bone-earth) is dissolved in acid and then
reprecipitated with an alkali, it is reprecipitated in the form of hydi-ated tribasic

phosphate of lime. He has recenth' had an opportunity of confirming this observa-

tion on a very large scale, and the resulting hydi'ated tribasic phosphate is likely to
become of great importance in agi-iculture.

               6. Oil Colliery Explosions. By "William Galloway.

     The author first described the genei-al arrangement of the airways and workings
in a large modern colliery, worked according to the long-wall method, and passed
 on to notice some hypotheses which had been entertained by himself and others on
the causes of firedamp explosions. As regards that attributing an influence to
 atmospheric pressure, it had been found by Mr. R. II. Scott and himself, that
whUe shallow mines are afiected by changes of weather, large and deep mines, in
 which great explosions nearly always occm-, are not perceptibly affected by them.

      It had occurred to him that possibly a mixture of firedamp and air, which

 contains too small a proportion of firedamp to render it explosive at ordinary

pressure and temperature, might become so when traversed by a wave of compres-

 sion originated by a local fii-edamp explosion or by a blown-out shot.
      About the same time it occiu-red to him also, that the sound-wave originated

 by a blown-out shot might carry the flame through the meshes of a safety-lamp
burning in an explosive mixtiu'e. Experiments had justified this hypothesis (see
 ' Proc. Royal Soc.,' 1874).

     None of the foregoing hypotheses coidd account for all the phenomena observ-

able after a great explosion ; and, in pursuing the subject stiU fui-ther, he began,
 towards the end of the year 1874, to specidate as to the probable influence of the
 coal-dust which is to be found nearly everj-where on the floor of dry and dusty
mines. Further investigations led him to the conclusion that if a mixture of coal-

·dust and pure air were not inflammable at ordinary pressure and temperature, it
would become so when a small proportion of firedamp was added ; and that the
coal-dust might fhus become the vehicle for conve_ying flame from one district of a
mine to another, alter it had been raised from the floor and mixed with the air of
the mine by some disturbing cause, such as a local explosion of firedamp or a
heavily charged blown-out shot. This view, that coal-dust and not firedamp plays
by far the most prominent part in great explosions, has been confirmed by all his
subseqiient observations, of which the following is a sketch :

     1. In July 1875 he found that an air-current made black with fine coal-dust
was not ignited by the flame of a lamp, but that when the air contained a small
proportion of firedamp (insufficient to render it inflammable alone) it became
inflanmiable when the same proportion of coal-dust was added to it and burned
witli a red smoky flame that filled the apparatus.

     2. In December 1875 he made a quantitative experiment with the view of

ascertaining the proportion of firedamp required to produce the foregoing residts,

and he found that one per cent., or rather less, was sufficient to do so. He attributes

the satisfactory character of this residt, and of all the results of his later experi-
ments with coal-dust, to the fact that he has employed only wind-carried dust in
making them, and this dust has not parted with its finest particles like that which
is to be found under screens and in other exposed situations.

      3. In June, 1876, Messrs. Hall and Clark read a paper before the North of
England Institute of Mining Engineers, describing experiments which showed that

the flame of a blown-out shot was prolonged to a distance of fifty yards, when it
was directed in such a manner as to lick up coal-dust strewed on the floor of a
sloping gallery. During the same year the author had practical proof of the same
thing in a Welsh mine, in which two explosions of coal-dust, by which men were

burnt and injured, were originated in this way, but the explosions died out again

when they reached damp portions of the roadways.

      4. Professor Freire-Marecco, of the College of Physical Science, Newcastle-on-

Tyne, commenced a series of experiments in 1876, and has continued them on a
larger scale since then, and he has obtained results similar to the foregoing by means

of a special apparatus.

     5. In 1878 he made three sets of experiments M'ith different kinds of

apparatus :

      a. In the first set, in which lighting gas was used instead of firedamp, and the
gas and air were carefully measured and the coal-dust weighed, it was sho^\^l that
2^ per cent, of gas mixed with air was rendered inflammable when coal-dust was
added ; 3 per cent, of gas made the mixtiu'e slightly explosive ; 4 per cent, made
it still more explosive ; and 6 per cent, produced a violent explosion. The total
quantity of gas and air mixture was little more than a cubic foot.

      b. Li the second set it was sho^vn that the return air of a mine containing 2 per
cent, of firedamp became inflammable when coal-dust was added to it.

      c. In the thii'd set the explosion of a mixtm-e of air and firedamp was made to
 raise and ignite coal-dust scattered along the floor of an artificial gallery, 70 or 80
 feet long, and 14 inches square inside. The flame of the firedamp explosion alone
 was found to be 7 or 8 feet long ; the flame of coal-dust in pure air was 35 or 40
 feet long ; and the flame of coal-dust in the return air employed in experiment a
 was 80 or 90 feet long. The two sets of experiments b and c were described in the
 ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' March 1879, and the set a has been described
 in a general way more recently.

      6. The great explosions of Risca, Seaham, and Penygi-aig Collieries took place
 in the year 1880, and all of them appeared to be wrapped in the usual mystery
 when viewed only from the firedamp standpoint. It was under these circum-

 stances that the Home Secretary requested Professor Abel to inquire into the

 causes of the Seaham explosion, and to ascertain if possible what influence, if any,
 the coal-dust was likely to have had in promoting the explosion. Professor Abel
 made experiments near Wigan, with an apparatus .similar to the one the author had
 employed in July 1875, and obtained results similar in kind, but different in some

 respects. He found that 2^- to 3i per cent, of firedamp was required to render a

mixture of air and coal-dust inflammable and that dust containing no combustible
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

matter produced flashes of flame in the apparatus when the air contained 3 to 3^
per cent, of firedamp. The autlior attributes the higli percentage of firedamp

required in the first case to the coarseness of the dust employed, since he obtained

similar results on using coarse dust instead of very fine. The second result appears

to be a curious one, but some light will doubtless be thrown upon it by future

experiments.

7. In July of the present summer the autlior made experiments, during the six

days of very warm dry weather ending on the 21st of that month, with an apparatus

Aof the following description.  sheet-iron cyhnder, 6 feet long by 2 feet in diameter,,

closed at one end and open at the other, has its open end bolted to a woodea

gallery, 126 feet long by 2 feet square inside. One end of the wooden gallery is

thus closed by the sheet-iron cylinder or explosion-chamber, and the other end is

open. Six sheets of newspaper are placed between the open end of the explosion

chamber and the gallery, and a tight joint is insured by means of the screws. Rather

less than two cubic feet of firedamp is carefully measured by means of water dis-
placement, and introduced into the explosion-chamber. The wooden gallery con-

tains only piu-e air. The firedamp contained in the explosion-chamber could not
find its way into the gallery except by passing through the six sheets of news-

paper, and if any part of it did so, it would be immediately carried away by a.

strong current of pure air, amomiting to 1,000 or 1,200 cubic feet per minute,

which enters the gallery just behind the paper, and traverses its whole length

towards the open end. It is thus doubly certain that the gallery contains nothing-

but pure air. The air and firedamp contained in the explosion-chamber are

thoroughly mixed by means of an appropriate mechanical arrangement, and the

mixture is exploded. The explosion bursts the sheets of paper, and the resulting

flame travels about 12 or 14 feet along the gallery, and as suddenly disappears.

The gallery is then strewed with a layer of fine coal-dust, fi-om ^ inch to ^ inch
thick, along its floor, and some is placed on shelves which stand in sets of three,,

one above the other, at distances of 10 feet from each other, along the gallery.

The same arrangement as before is then made in regard to preparing for a fire-
damp explosion, exactly the same quality of firedamp being measured, mixed, and

exploded.

    By the explosion of the firedamp mixture the coal-dust is raised in a cloud,

throughout the whole length of the gallery, part of it is projected out into the

air to a distance of 20 or 30 feet beyond the end, and, after the lapse of an appre-

ciable interval of time, the flame finds its way to the end of the gallery, and flashes

out through the cloud of dust to a greater or less distance, according to cir-

cumstances. The greatest lengths of flame thus obtained with coal-dust and pm-e

air was 147 feet on one occasion, and from 100 to 140 feet very often.

The author considers that these results prove in the most convincing manner

that coal-dnst forms an inflammable mixture with pure air, and they settle once-

for all the question as to how an explosion, begun in one district of a dry and dusty

mine, can penetrate to the most distant parts of every other district of workings

in the same mine.

     If, then, water were sprinkled on the floor of all dry mines from time to time,

and always before fii-ing blasting shots, we should, in the author's opinion, have-

no more disastrous coUiery explosions, such as those with which we have become-

but too famOiar during the last ten or fifteen years.

Cuprous mercuric iodide, Cu^Hgl^, is prepared by the following process. Mercuric

phenomenon, possessed T^y many bodies in less degree, led the author to select it

from amongst bodies whose colour changes with heat, to verify one point of the

electro-magnetic theory of light. According to that theory, all good conductors of

electricity should he opaque to light ; and therefore, if this theory holds good, the

increase of opacity and of light-absorbing power by a body should indicate that its

electrical conductivity was increasing. To put this to the test the author has

measured the conducting power of the iodide at various temperatures. This was

done by placing a film of the iodide about 1 millimetre thick between two plates of

platinised lead, each 10 centimetres square, and determining its resistance in a
AWheatstone's bridge at different temperatures.
                                                              decrease was observed from

40° C. up to about 110° C, at which the resistance began again to increase. The

author believes this increase to be due to dissociation setting in, as at about 150° C.

it is decomposed, mercuric iodide subliming away and leaving pale brown cuprous

iodide behind. The greatest change of resistance was between 65° 0. and 90° 0.

with rising temperattu-es, and between 95° C. and 75° 0. with falling temperatures.

In both cases tlie maximum rate of increase of conductivity was between 87'5° and

88"5° C, precisely the temperature at which the rate of change of tint is also a

maximum. The specific electric conductivity doubles between 82° and 92°. The

following values of Xt tbe specific electric conductivity, were obtained :

                                           At50°C. X = 2-396 x lO-s

                                           92° = 18-64 X 10-3

                                           109°               = 23-95 X 10-8

                                              dd

     These results were therefore held to support the theory, though experiments on
other bodies exhibiting similar phenomena were to be desired in confirmation, before
any sweeping generalisation would be admissible.

     The author pointed out, in conclusion, that the remarkable change of colour

exhibited by this body rendered it a valuable thermoscope for lecture purposes. He

had employed it for demonstrating to an audience the heating effects of absorption
of radiation, the conductivity of heat in crystals, and the heat produced by
magnetic and mechanical friction.

7. Analyses of the Water and Gas from Blowing Wells near Northallerton.

                                By T. Fairlet, F.B.S.E.

--The wells are three in number : Well at Solberge, 3^ miles S. from Northal-

lerton                           well  at  Langton, about  4  nules W.N.W. from Northallerton ;  and well at
                              ;

Omhams, 2 miles S. from Boroughbridge. In each of these currents of air ilow

from the shafts of the wells during a falling period of the barometer, and inward

Whencurrents flow into the shafts while the barometer is rising.              the rise or fall

is considerable the currents are very powerful, causing a strong draught or wind

in the openings leading to the shaft.

The well at Solberge is situated on Mr. Hutton's estate near his residence.

Through this gentleman's kindness and assistance the author was able to make a

Anumber of experiments.                    number of analyses of the gas from the out-current

showed it to be common air containing 20'9 per cent, of oxygen. Analyses of the

water gave the results (grains per gallon) :

602 EEPORT-- 1881.

    As the author conceived, there must be a large cavity communicatiug with the

shaft of the well, at his request Mr. Huttoii had the well opened, and on descending

with a candle he easily found the fissures in the sandstone, through which the
air was passing at a depth of about 15 yards from the surface.

   A piece of this sandstone, broken off at the side of the fissure, contained the

following :

Moisture                                     1-25
                                           87-72

     To obtain the approximate volume of the cavity by the application of Boyle's
law, careful readings were taken of the barometer at Solberge, and the current was
measured, first by means of an anemometer, afterwards by means of very large diy
gas-meters. The results of numerous observations made by Mr. Hutton, select-
ing those where the current due to the change of pressure had had sufficient time
to expend itself, give an approximate volume of about ten million cubic feet,
corresponding to a cubic space measuring 217 feet each way.

     The cui'rents at the other wells also consist of au', and vary with the barometric

pressure.

8. On Experiments tuitli Manures on the Barley Crop of 1881
                      Bij W. IvisoN Macadam.

The author said that he was engaged in a large series of experiments with the

various crops, to determine the best seasons for the application of different manures

Aand the results of the various treatments.       large number of results had been

obtained, but the present Paper was restiicted to the consideration of two lots of

barley, the first of which was grown on land from which a pre\'ious turnip crop had

been eaten by sheep, and in the case of the second the turnips had been carted off

the land. The results showed that the water, which was most large during the

earliest stages of gi'0-^\i;h, gradually decreased with an increasing amount of organic

vegetable matter during the ripening process. The results also showed that the

effect of eating the turnips on the land was best seen on the commencement of wet
weather, when the barley on the land so treated rushed forward and became much

more healthy in appearance and hea^ier in weight than the second sample, and

that it also yielded a heavier crop on ripening.

      9. On tlie Hydration of Salts and Oxides. By C. F. Cross, B.Sc.

     The author bases his method of observation of the rate of hydration of salts
and oxides, viz., confinement over water of the substances in bell-jars of 2,000 cc.
capacity, and in quantities of 1'25 grms. or less, and distributed in the finest state
of division over a circular area of 60 nun. diameter, upon a critical experimental
investigation. As a typical instance of the results obtained, details ai-e given
of the obsen-ations of the hydration of Copper Sulphate (CuSO^.H,,0). Com-
bination with water proceeds with diminishing velocity up to the point cor-
responding to the pentahydrate, at which it remains constant for some hours,
after which deliquescence sets in, and the combination with water continues
until a liquid mass is obtained. Potassium Dichromate represents another class of
salts which appear to condense water into their substance, rather than combine
with it (although the quantity taken up is observed to be in simple molecular ratio),
since they are again rendered anhydrous by pressm-e between blotting paper, or
short exposure to ordinaiy air. Potassium Sodium and Magnesiuin Sulphates pass

continuously through hydration to deliquescence.

     Feri-ic Oxide (ppt. dry at 100°) rapidl\- combines with 1 mol. Hfi, after which
it slowly takes up a further 3 mols. ; on exposure to the air it loses 2 mols., and in
the form of the trihydrate appears to be stable. The hydration of the oxides and
of all bodies is greatly influenced by methods of preparation.

   10. On Cellulose and Coal. By C. F. Ckoss, S.Sc, and E. J. Bevan.

     The authors have obtained, by the action of sulphuric acid upon cellulose, black
substances, resembling coal in appearance and percentage-composition (C and H),
which are convertible, by the action of chlorine, into derivatives, resembling those
obtained by the direct chlorination of liguefied fibres. The yield of the black
substance is about 35 per cent, of the original substance (dextrin), i.e. in view of
its higher carbon percentage (60° to 70°) about 60 per cent, of the carbon of the

carbohydrate takes this aromatic form, the remainder being liberated as carbonic

and acetic acids, &c. The passage of cellulose into these compounds suggests the
probability of its conversion into lignin as a result of plant-life. In support of
this view the authors cite their experiments on the probable existence of plant-
constituents intermediate between the two groups (jute) ; Meisseur's experiments
on the origin of the hippuric acid of the ui'ine of herbivora, which he refers to a
constituent of hay contaming a benzoic residue, arid which appears to be a form

of cellulose : the formation of astringent bodies at the expense of plant-structures,
as in the 'pathological' tannins and the decay of the jute-fibre ; the occun-ence of
tannin and carbohydrates in intimate association throughout the plant world

and, lastly, the chemistry of coal. They regard cellulose, lignin, peat, lignite, and
anthracite as, probably, terms of a vast series of compounds differentiated under
conditions which we can only very approximately imitate or even conceive.

    11. On the Neio Element, Actinium. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C.8.

     The author has at last succeeded in isolating the new metallic element which he
has found in white zinc pigment, to which it gives the peculiar property of darkening
in about twenty minutes when exposed to the direct rays of the sun, but not so
when protected by a sheet of glass, and becoming again white in the course of a
few hours when placed in the dark.

     The new metal has been obtained ia the form of oxide and in the form of

sulphide. Its isolation is based principally upon the facts, that its oxide is only
slightly soluble in caustic soda, and not precipitated by ammonia from solutions
containing salts of ammonia ; that its sulphide is scarcely soluble in acetic acid, but

readily soluble in mineral acids, even when they are slightly diluted. He has

proved that it differs essentially from zinc, cadmium, manganese, and lanthanum,

with which alone it is possible, for a moment, to confuse it. He has obtained no

less than about fom* per cent, from some white zinc pigment as found in commerce.
This yield is enormous. The presence of this new metal in commercial zinc will

fully explain discrepancies as to the equivalent of that metal.

     After a great number of experiments he has adhered to the following simple

process for the extraction of actinium :

     1. The pigment (about 12 grammes) is digested for twenty-four hours in dilute
acetic acid, washed and digested for another twenty-four houi'S in dilute hydro-

chloric acid (8 per cent.), and the residue washed.
     2. The residue is dissolved in strong hydi-ochloric acid, with occasional additions

of nitric acid ; the chlorides are treated with excess of caustic soda, which leaves
oxide of actinium and dissolves the oxide of zinc. The oxide of actinium is dis-

solved in hydrochloric acid, and again treated ^vith excess of caustic soda (the
operation is repeated two or three times) ; finally, to separate a little oxide of iron,
the oxide of actinium is dissolved in excess of HCl, and the solution treated with
excess of ammonia, which only precipitates the iron. The oxide of actinium re-

--maining in solution is precipitated by sulphide of ammonium.
     Oxide of Actinium. The hydrate forms a bulky white precipitate, more gelatinous
than oxide of zinc. Unlike the latter, it is only slightly soluble in caustic soda. It is

insoluble in excess of sulphide of ammonium, very slightly soluble in acetic acid,
readily soluble in mineral acids, even when rather dilute. Exposed to the direct
rays of the sun it darkens in about twenty minutes, except where protected by a

piece of glass.

                             12. On BowJcett's Thermograph.

                 By Wm. Lant Cakpenter, B.A., B.Sc, F.G.S.

     The construction of this instrument is based on an application of the principle of
Bourdon's steam-gauge, the changing pressure of a confined fluid under varying
temperatures being used to obtain a motion for registering those temperatures.
Upon a flat, circiilar, metallic vessel, 3 inches in diameter and |-inch thick, is a
hollow metallic spring or sealed tube communicating with it, filled with fluid,
circular in shape, and fixed at one end. The other end is free to move, and very
minute changes in temperature cause it to do so, the amount of movement being
proportionate to the pressure, and this again proportional to the increase of tempe-
rature producing the expansion. The movements are magnified by a lever system,
and recorded by a pen upon a cardboard disc, rotating once in twenty-foiu" hours,
divided by concentric circles into degrees, and into hours by radial lines. The
instrument had been extensively used, clinically and otherwise, and would be

On the Origin mid Progress of the present state of British Geology, especially

        since the first meeting of the British Association at Yorh in 1831.

In the year 1788, Hutton published his first sketch of his ' Theory of the Earth,'

afterwards extended and explained by Playfair in a manner more popular and per-
spicuous than is done in Hutton's own writings. In this grand work, Hutton
clearly explains that the oldest known strata, like their successors, are derivative,

and that as far as observation can discover, in all geological time, ' we find no
vestige of a beginning, and no sign of an end." The complement to this fav-seeing

observation was at length brought about by William Smith, in his original ' Geo-

logical Map of the Strata of England and Wales' in 1815, followed, in 1816, by

his ' Strata Identified by Organised Fossils.' This great discovery, for such it was,

threw a new light on the history of the earth, proving what had before been xm-

known, that all the ' secondary ' formations at least from the lias to the chalk

inclusive, contained each a set of distinctive fossils by which it could be recognised.

A law was thus provided for the identification of formations which geographically

are often widely separated from each other, not only in England in the case of
minor outliers, but also easily applicable to great areas on the neighbourino- con-
tinent of Europe.

     In 1811, the first volume of the ' Transactions ' of the Geological Society was
published, and in 1826-27, there appeared the first volume of the ' Proceedings,'

the object being to communicate to the fellows as promptly as possible the pro-

ceedings of the Society ' during the intervals between the appearance of the
several parts of the Transactions.' The last volume of the 'Transactions ' contains
memoirs read between the years 1845-1856, and only four volumes of the ' Pro-
ceedings ' appeared between the years 1826 and 1845 inclusive, after which the
title of the annual volume was changed to that of the ' Quarterly Journal of the
Geological Society.' The Geological Society, to whicli the science owes so much,

was therefore in full action when the British Association was founded in 1831
and the memoirs read before the society from 1831 to this date, may be said to
show generally the state of British geology during the last fifty years. To this
must be added the powerful influence of the first (1830) and later editions of Lyell's
' Principles of Geology,' a work which helped to lay the foundations of those re-
searches in Physical Geology which in both earlier and later years have attracted
so much attention.

Fifty years ago in this city. Viscount Milton was president of the first meeting

of ' The British Association for the advancement of Science,' which he explained

had for its chief object ' to give a stronger impulse and more systematic direction

to scientific inquiry.' In his address, he pointed out the numbers of Philosophical

Societies which had by degrees sprung up in all parts  of the  kingdom                                       and  the
                                                                                                          ;

practicability, through the means of the Association, ' including all the scientific

strength of Great Britain,' 'to point out the lines in which the direction of

science should move.'

     In that year, 1831, Professor Sedgwick was president of the Geological Society,
and the Geological and Geographical Committee of the British Association re-

commended that geologists should examine the truth of that part of the theory

of Elie de Beaumont, in its application to England, Scotland, and Ireland, which

asserts that the lines of disturbance of the strata assignable to the same age are

parallel ; that Professor Phillips be requested to draw up a systematic catalogue of

all the  organised fossils  of  Great   Britain  and  Ireland                                                                               and  that  Mr.  Robert  Steven-

son, civil engineer, be requested to prepare a report upon the waste and ertension

of the kind on the east coast of Britain, and the question of the ])ermane)ice of the
relative level of the sea and land.

In 1881 it seems strange to us that, in 1831, with William Smith's map of

'The Strata of England and Wales, with part Scotland' before them, it should

have been considered necessary to institute an inquiry as to the truth of the

general parallelism of disturbed strata, which, in a limited area like England, had

suffered upheaval  at       difl'erent  successive epochs                                                                                   and we may fancy the    internal
                                                                                                                                         ;

smile with which Phillips, the nephew of Smith, regarded the needless proposal.

The masterpiece of the old land surveyor and civil engineer remains to this day

the foundation of all subsequent geological maps of England and Wales ; and as

-- --an unaided effort of practical genius for such it was it seems impossible that it

should be surpassed, in spite of all the accuracy and detail which happily modem

science has introduced into modern geological maps.

The first paper read at York, in the year 1831, was by Professor Sedgwick,

' On the general structure of the Lake Mountains of the North of England.' This

was followed by ' Supplementary Observations on the Structure of the Austrian

and Bavarian Alps,' by the Secretary of the Society, Mr. Murchison, a memoir

at that time of the highest value, and still valuable, both in a stratigraphical point

of view, and also for the light which it threw on the nature of the disturbance?

that originated the Alpine mountains, and their relations in point of date to the

far more ancient mountains of Bohemia. In his elaborate address in the same

year, on his retiring from the president's chair, he largely expatiates on the paral-

lelism of many of the great lines of disturbance of what were then distinguished

as the more ancient schistose and greywacke mountains, and quotes the authority

of Elie de Beaumont for the statement, ' that mountain chains elevated at the

same period of time, have a general parallelism in the bearing of their component

strata.' On a gi-eat scale this undoubtedly holds true, as, for example, in the case

of the Scandinavian chain, and the more ancient palaeozoic rocks north of Scot-

laud, Cumberland, and even of great part of Wales. The same holds good with

regard to the parallelism of the much more recent mountain ranges of the Apen-

nines, the Alps, the Caucasus, the Atlas, and the Himalayas, all of which strike

more or less east and west, and are to a great extent of post-Eocene, and even partly

of post-Miocene age. The same, however, is not precisely the case with the

Apalachian chain and the Rocky Mountains of North America, the first of which

trends N.N.W., and the latter N.N.E. The remarkable chain of the Ural Moun-

tains trends nearly true north and south, and is parallel to no other chain that

I know of, unless it be the Andes and the mountains of Japan. It is worthy of

notice that the chain of the Ural is of pre-Permian age according to Murchison,

while Darwin has shown that the chief upheaval of the Andes took place in post-

Cretaceous times.

     The Apalachian chain is chiefly of post-Carboniferous date, and the Rocky
Mountains have been re-disturbed and re-elevated as late as post-Miocene times.

     In the same address Professor Sedgwick entered an eloquent protest against the
broad uniformitarian views so powerfully advocated in the first edition of Lyell's
' Principles of Geology ' in 18-30, in which, throwing aside all discussion concern-
ing cosmogony, he took the world as he found it, and agreeing with Hutton that
geology is in no ways concerned with, and not sufficiently advanced to deal ' with

questions as to the origin of things,' he saw that a great body of new data were

required such as engaged the attention of the Geological Society (founded in 1807),
which along with other foreign societies and private work has at length brought

geological science to its present high position.

    And what is that position ? With great and consentient labour many men

gifted with a knowledge of stratigraphical and palteontological geology, have, so
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  607

to speak, more or less dissected all the regions of Europe and great part of North

America, India, and of our colonies, and in vast areas, sometimes nearly adjoining,

and sometimes far distant from each other, the various formations, by help of the

fossils they contain, have been correlated in time, often in spite of great differences

in their lithological characters. It is easy, for example, to correlate the various

formations in countries so near as Great Britain and Ireland, or of the Secondary
and Lower Tertiary formations of England and France; and what is more re-

markable, it is easy to correlate the palfeozoic formations of Britain and the

eastern half of the United States and Canada, even in many of the comparatively

minute stratigraphical and lithological subdivisions of the Silurian, Devonian, and
Carboniferous formations. The same ma)'- be said with regard to some of the

palasozoic formations of India, China, Africa, and Australia, and many of the
secondary and tertiary deposits have in like manner been identified as having their

equivalents in Europe. It is not to be inferred from these coincidences that such
deposits were all formed jn-eciseh/ at the same time, but taken in connection with
their palseontological contents, viewed in the light which Darwin has shown with

regard to the life of the globe when considered in its relation to masses of
stratified formations, no modern geologist who gives his mind to such subject-s
would be likely to state, for example, that in any part of the globe Silurian rocks
may be equivalents in time to any of our Upper Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, or Tertiary

formations.

     For all the latest details of yenera and species found in the British Palteozoic

rocks, from those of St. David's, so well worked out by Dr. Hicks, to the Carbon-
iferous series inclusive, I must refer to the elaborate address of Mr. Etheridge,

President of the Geological Society, which he delivered at the last anniversary
meeting of that Society. It is a work of enormous labour and skill, which could

not have been produced by anyone who had not a thorough personal knowledo-e

of all the formations of Britain and of their fossil contents.'

     In connection with such subjects I will not in any way deal with the tempting

and important subject of cosmological geology, which in my opinion must go back

to times far anterior to the date of the deposition, as common sediments, of the
very oldest known metamorphic strata. Cosmological speculations perhaps may

be sound enough with regard to the refrigeration, and the first consolidation of the

crust of the earth, but all the known tangible rocky formations in the world have

no immediate relation to them, and in my opinion the oldest Laurentian rocks

were deposited long after the beginning and end of lost and unknown epochs,
during which stratified rocks were formed by watery agents in the same way that
the Laurentian rocks were deposited, and in which modern formations are being
deposited now, and the gneissose structure of the most ancient formations was the
result of an action which has at intervals characterised all geological time as late
as the Eocene formations in the Alps and elsewhere.

     The same kind of chronological reasoning is often applicable to igneous rocks.
It was generally the custom, many years ago, to recognise two kinds of igneous
rocks, viz., Volcanic and Plutonic, and this classification somewhat modified in
details is still applicable, the Plutonic consisting chiefly of granitic rocks and
their allies, which, though they have often altered and thrust veins into the ad-
joining strata, have never, as far as I know, overflowed in the manner of the lavas
of modern and ancient volcanoes. Indeed, as far as I recollect, the first quoted
examples of ancient volcanoes are those of Miocene age in the districts of Auver^ne,
the A elay, and the Eifel, and the fact that signs of ordinary volcanic phenomena
are found in almost all the larger groups of strata was scarcely suspected. Now,
however, we know them to be associated with strata of all or almost all geological
ages, from Lower Silurian times down to the present day, if we take the wliole
world into account. Amongst them, those of Miocene date hold a very prominent

place, greatly owing, doubtless, to the comparative perfection of their forms, as, for
example, those of the South of France and of the Eifel. Their conical shapes,

lecture when installed in the Chair of Geology at Oxford in 1875, the subject of
which is ' The Past and Future of Geology.'

and numerous extinct craters, afford testimony so plain, that he who runs may
read their history. The time when they became extinct would doubtless amaze

us by its magnitude, if it could be stated in years, but yet it is comparatively so

recent that not all the undying forces of atmospheric degradation have been able

to obliterate their individual origin.

It is, however, generally very different with respect to volcanoes of Mesozoic

age, for though Lyell stated with doubt, that volcanic products of Jur.assic date

are found in  the Morea, and in  the Apennines                                                                       and Medlicott  and Blanford  con-
                                                                                                                  ;

sider that probably the igneous rocks of Rajmahal may be of that age, we must, per-

haps, wait for further information before the question may be considered as finally

settled. Of Jurassic age no actual craters remain. Darwin also has stated, on

good grounds, that in the Andes a line of volcanic eruptions has been at work from

before the deposition of the Cretaceo-oolitic formation down to the present day.
    In the British Islands we have a remarkable series of true volcanic rocks, the

chronology of which has been definitely determined. The oldest of these belong

to the Lower Silurian epoch, as shown, for example, on a large scale in Pembroke-

shire, at Builth in Radnorshire, in the Longmynd country west of the Stiper

stones in Shropshire, and on a far greater scale in North Wales and Cumbria. Of
later date we find volcanic lavas and ashes in the Devonian rocks of Devon, and
in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. The third series is plentiful among the

Carboniferous rocks of Scotland, and in a smaller way associated with the

Coal-measures of South Staffordshire, Warwickshire and the Clee Hills. The

fourth series chronologically is associated with the Permian strata in Scotland, and

the fifth and last consists of the Miocene basaltic rocks of the Inner Hebrides and

the mainland of the AVest of Scotland.

In the liritish Islands the art of geological surveying has, I believe, been

carried out in a more detailed manner than in any other country in Europe, a

matter which has been rendered comparatively easy by the excellence of the

Ordnance Survey maps both on the 1-inch and the 6-inch scales. When the

whole country has been mapped geologically little will remain to be done in geo-

logical surveying, excepting corrections here and there, especially in the earliest

published maps of the South-west of England. Palfeontological detail may, how-

ever, be carried on to any extent, and much remains to be done in microscopic

petrology which now deservedly occupies the attention of many skilled observers.
    Time will not permit me to do more than advert to the excellent and well-

known geological surveys now in action in India, Canada, the United States, Aus-

tralia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

    On the Continent of Europe there are National Geological Survej's of great
and well-deserved repute conducted by men of the highest eminence in geological
science, and it is to be hoped the day may come when a more detailed survey will
follow the admirable map executed by Sir Roderick Murchison, De Verneuil, and

Count Keyserling, and published in their joint work, 'The Geology of Russia in

Europe and the Ural Mountains.'

    It is difficult to deal with the Future of Geology. Probably in many of the
European formations, more may be done in tracing the details of subformations.
The same may be said of much of North America, and for a long series of years

a great deal must remain almost untouched in Asia, Africa, South America, and

in the islands of the Pacific Ocean. If, in the far future, the day should come
when such work shall be undertaken, the process of doing so must necessarily be
slow, partly for want of proper maps, and possibly in some regions partly for the

want of trained geologists. Palaeontologists must always have ample work in the
discovery and description of new fossils, marine, freshwater, and truly terrestrial
and besides common stratigraphical geology, geologists have still an ample
field before them in working out many of those physical problems which form

the true basis of Physical Geography in every region of the earth. Of the

history of the earth there is a long past, the early chapters of which seem to be

lost for ever, and we know little of the future except that it appears that ' the
stir of this dim spot which men call earth,' as far as Geology is concerned, shows

' no sign of an end.'

         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  609

     The following Papers were read :

1. On the Laurentian Beds of Donegal and of other parts of Ireland. By
     Professor Edward Hull, LL.D., F.B.S., Director of the Geological

      Survey of Ireland.

      After a perusal of tlie writings of previous authors, and a personal examination

made in the spring of 1881, in company with two of his colleagues of the Geo-
logical Survej', Mr. R. G. Symes, F.G.S., and ISIr. S. B. Wilkinson, the author had

arrived at the following conclusions.
      1st. That the Gueissose series of Donegal, sometimes called ' Donegal Granite,'

is unconformably overlain by the metamorphosed quartzites, schists, and limestones
which Professor Harkness had shown to be the representatives of the Lower
Silurian beds of Scotland (' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc' vol. xvii., p. 256). This
unconformity is especially noticeable in the district of Lough Salt near Glen.

      2nd. That the Gneissose series is similar in character and identical in position
and age with the ' Fundamental Gneiss ' (Murchisou) of parts of Sutherlandshire
and ilossshire, and is, therefore, like the latter, presumably of Laurentian age.
That the formation is a metamorphosed series of sedimentary beds, has been
shown by Dr. Haughton and Mr. 11. H. Scott.

      3rd. That the north-western boundary of the Donegal Gneiss is a large fault
between the Laurentian Gneiss and the metamorphosed Lower Silurian beds,
owing to which the older rocks have been elevated, and by denudation have been

-exposed at the surface.

      4th. That the Cambrian formation of Scotland is not represented in Donegal,
and that the unconformity above referred to represents a double hiatus, and is of
the same character as that which occurs in Sutherlandshire, in the district of
Foinaven and Ben Arkle, where the Lower Silurian beds rest directly on the
 Laurentian Gneiss.

     5th. That Laurentian rocks may be recognised in other parts of Ireland, as in
the Slieve Gamph and Ox Mountains of Mayo and Sligo, at BelmuUet, and in
 West Galway north of Galway Bay, where the rocks consist of red gneiss, horn-

blende rock, and schist, &c., similar to those in Donegal ; also possibly in Co. Tyrone,
as suggested by Mr. Kinahan.

2. On the Laurentian Bodes in Ireland.^ By G. H. Kinahan, M.R.I.A., ^c.

     The writer first mentioned that Cainozoic and Mesozoic rocks only occurred in
the province of Ulster, while in the rest of the island there was a nearly continuous
sequence of Palaeozoic rocks, from the Coal-Measures down to the Cambrian,

proved by the work of Griffith, Jukes, and their subordinates. He then pointed

out that a recent attempt had been made to try and disturb their natural order,
but that the new theory was founded solely on assertions that would not bear

investigation.

    He proceeded to observe that the geologists of the Pre-Cambrian school ap-

peared to lay more weight on lithological evidence than that to which it was
entitled, and in continuation he gave the localities for the oldest rocks in Ireland,
with the reasons for and against the rocks being Laurentian. The localities are
Carnsore or S.E. Wexford, where it was shown that although the rocks were
lithologically similar to the I-aurentians, yet they contained Cambrian fossils Gal-
liuiy, S^E. Mai/o, Sliffo, and L'iitrim --rock* that, from their lithological cliaracters,

were said to be Laurentian by Murchison, who recanted his statement when

years ago, was suggested by Jukes, while now it is positively asserted, but solely
on lithological characters. The author pointed out that, although these rocks

lithnlogically were very like Laurentians, they were more like Huronians, Logan's

description of the latter being very suitable for those of Donegal. He also

pointed out that it was unnecessary to make vague assertions, as the stratigraphical
position of the rocks ought to be easily worked out, either by starting from the
Pomeroy fossiliferous rocks, or from the fossiliferoua rocks found in Donegal by
Dr. King ; but that, at the same time, the work must be much bettpr and more
correctly done than that in the neighbourhood of Pomeroy, where the unaltered
fossiliferous beds are classed with those they lie on, although the latter were

extensively metamorphosed, contorted, upturned, and denuded, prior to the fos-

--siliferous rocks being deposited on them. N.E. Antrim rocks supposed to be of

the same age as the older rocks near Pomeroy {Upper Cambrians).

     3. Jb'fe in Irish and other Laurentian Bocks. Bij C. MooRE, F.G.S.

     The author drew attention to certain forms found by a microscopic examination'
of specimens of certain Laurentian and other Palfeozoic limestone prepared by tri-
turation, solution in acid, and washing. These forms were clearly those of organic
structures, some apparently hairs and others feather-barbs. The author considered
that he had taken precautions to eliminate sources of error, through admixture
of foreign materials ; and he was led to think that the organisms belonged to the-

rocks.

4. On the occurrence of Granite in sitii, about 20 miles 8.W. of the Eddy-

                             stone.^ Bij a. R. Hunt, M.A., F.G.S.

     The author stated that during the past year he had received four specimens of
rocks from the English Channel, trawled by Mr. W. M. Bayne's fishing vessel, the
Pelican. Of these, three were trawled as detached blocks, and were respec-
tively a gabbro, an actinolite rock, and a diabase : the fourth was a fragment of
granite brought up in October 1880, about 20 miles S.W. of the Eddystone, after the
vessel had been about three hours fast in what the crew iirst supposed to be
a wreck. This fragment, which is about two inches in thickness, shows a clean

fracture, has marine organisms on both sides, and has undoubtedly been detnched
from a submarine rock. There is no absolute proof forthcoming that this rock is

in sitii, but from the fact that the fishermen knew of no rocks in the neighbour-

hood, it can scarcely be a large erratic Ij'ing uncovered at the bottom of the
English Channel, as such an obstruction would soon be found out and avoided..
If an erratic, and too large to be moved by the hauling gear of a 60-ton vessel, it
must be buried in the sand, and in this respect ditfer from the detached blocks
described last year, which lie strewn on the surface of the Channel bed to the
southward of the Bolt and Start. In mineral composition this granite agrees with
the gneiss of the Eddystone and the gneiss of the Shovel Ileef in Plymouth Sound,,
all these rocks being couiposed of orthoclase and plagioclase, the two micas and
quartz, without either hornblende or schorl. The fact that the Shovel gneiss does
not alter the Devonian rocks of Plymouth, the author considered an indication that
these typical Channel gneisses are of pre-Devonian age.

5. Some Observations on the Causes of Volcanic Action. By J. Prestwich,

          M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford.

      Considerable difference of opinion still exists as to the cause of volcanic action.

The hypothesis, liowever, generally accepted in this country is that of the late

Assoc. 1881.

TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION C.  611

Mr. Poulett Scrope/ who consiilered that ' the rise of hxva in a volcanic vent is

occasioned by the expansion of volumes of high-pressure steam, generated in a
mass of liquefied and lieated matter within or beneath the eruptive orifice.' Ac-
cording to his view, the expulsion of the lava is effected solely by high-pressure

steam generated in the volcanic foci, hut no explanation is given how the water is

--introduced.
     The objections to this hypothesis are 1st. That during the most powerful
explosions, i.e. when the discharge of steam is at its maximum, the escape of lava
is frequently at its minimum, and vice versa.

     2ndly. That streams of lava often flow with little disengagement of steam, and
are generally greatest after the force of the first violent explosions is expended.

     3rdly. That it is not a mere boiling over, in which case, after the escape of the

--active agent-- the water and the expulsion of such portion of the obstructing

medium, the lava, as became entangled with it, the remaining lava would subside

in the vent to a depth corresponding to the quantity of lava ejected; but the level
of the lava, ca'teris paribus, remains the same during successive eruptions. Of the
important part played by water in volcanic eruptions there can be no doubt, but
instead of considering it as the primarj', the author views it as a secondary cause

in volcanic eruptions.

      All observers agree in describing ordinary volcanic eruptions as generally ac-
companied or preceded by shocks or earthquakes of a minor or local character, to

which succeed paroxysmal explosions, during which vast quantities of stones,

scorite, and ashes, together with volumes of steam^ are projected from the crater.

The violence of the explosions gradually decreases and they then cease altogether.
The flow of lava, on the other hand, which commences sooner or later after the
first explosions, is continued and prolonged independently. Ultimately the vol-
cano returns to a state of repose, which may last a few months or many years.

     Adopting the theory of an original igneous (but now in greater part solid) nucleus

and of a thin crust, the author considers a certain fluidity of the former, or of a
portion thereof, and mobility of the latter, to be proved by the facts of the case.
The one and the other feebly represent conditions of which the phenomena of the

rocks afford clearer and stronger evidence as we go back in geological time. It is

estimated that a small quantity of central heat still reaches the surface and is
lost by radiation into space. It is evident also that even the escape of liquid
lava and steam from volcanoes, and of hot springs from these and other sources,
must bring, in however small a quantity, a certain increment of heat from the in-
terior to the surface, where it is lost. This must lead to some very slight con-
traction of the nucleus, and of re-adjustment of the external crust, in consequence
of which the fused matter of the interior from time to time tends to be forced

outwards. So far the author agrees with many other geologists. The additional
hypothesis which he now suggests, he has, however, been mainly led to form by
his researches on underground waters, and may be stated generally as follows :

    A portion of the rain falling on the surface not only of permeable and fissured

sedimentary strata, but also of fissured and creviced crystalline and other rocks,

passes below ground, and is there transmitted as far down as the permeable rocks
range, or as the fissures in the recks extend, unless some counteracting causes
intervene. Those causes are the occurrence of impermeable strata, faults, and
heat. The former two are irregular, the latter one is constant. The increase of
temperature with depth being 1° Fahr. for every 50 to 60 ft., the boiling-point of
water would be reached at a depth of about 10,000 ft., but, owing to the pressure

 of the superincumbent rocks, it has been estimated that water will retain its
liquidity imd continue to circulate freely to far greater depths, but a point will
 be reached where the tension of the heated water will equilibrate the pressure.

      Very little is known of the substrata of volcanoes. Etna and Hecla apparently

stand on permeable Tertiary strata, Vesuvius on Tertiary and Cretaceous strata,
while in South America some of the volcanoes are seemingly situated amongst

     ' For reasons that will be app.nrent, the author does not discuss the chemical
theory of Davy or the ingenious theruio<lvnnmical theory of Mallet.

palaeozoic and crystalline rocks. Under ordinary circumstances, all the permeable
strata and all fissured rocks become charjjed with water up to the level of the

lowest point of escape on the surface, or if there should be an escape in the sea-

bed, then to the sea-level, })lus a difference caused by friction.
     The extreme porosity of lavas is well known. All the water falling on the

surface of Etna and Vesuvius (except where the rocks are decomposed and a

surface soil formed), disappears at once, passing into the fissures and cavities formed
by the contraction of the lava in cooling. Not only are these fissures tilled, but the

water lodges in the main duct itself, and occasionally rises to a height to fill the
crater. Beneath the mass of fragmentary and cavernous volcanic materials form-

ing the volcano, lies the original compact mass of sedimentary strata, &c. Owing

to the fortunate circumstance of an Artesian well having been sunk at Naples,

we know that under 735 feet of volcanic beds there are 787 feet of sedimentary

strata consisting of alternating strata of marl, sands, and sandstones, some water-

bearing, others impermeable. This boring passed through three water-bearing

beds--one in the volcanic ashes, the second in tlie Sub-Apennine beds, and the

third in the Cretaceous strata at the bottom. The water from the lowest spring

rose 8 feet above the surface, or 81 feet above the sea-level.

     It is well known that where the strata crop out in the sea-bed, the pres-
sure of tlie column of inland water forces the fresh water outwards, so as

to form freshwater springs in the sea, as at Spezzia and elsewhere on the
Mediterranean coast. It is this fundamental hvdrostatic principle which keeps
wells in islands, and in shores adjacent to the sea, free from salt water, as in the
Isle of Thanet. But though the head of inland water is sufficient to force back
the sea-water under ordinary conditions, if the normal conditions are disturbed by
pumping to an extent that lowers the line of water-level to below that of the sea-
level, then the sea-water will flow inwards until an equilibrium is established.

    When undisturbed, the underground fissures and cavities of the volcanic

materials forming a volcano soon become filled bv the infiltration of rain-
water from the surface, while the strata on which they rest are charged, or not,
with water, according as they are permeable or impermeable--following the usual

laws affecting underground waters. No eruption of lava can then take place
without coming in contact with these underground waters. The first to be
affected will be the water in the cavities of the mountain and the crater. As

the pressure of the ascending column of lava splits the crust formed in the vent

subsequently to the preceding eruption, the water finds its way to the heated

rock, and leads to explosions more or less violent. Further, as the fluid lava breaks
more completely through the crust, and the mountain becomes fissured bv the force
and pressure of the ascending column, all the water stored in the mountain suc-
cessively flows in upon the hot lava, and flashes off into steam. Thence those
more violent detonations and explosions--those deluges of rain arisins from the

condensed steam--with which the great eruptions usually commence. As the
more superficial waters lodged in the superincumbent lavas and ashes are ex-

hausted, the springs in the deeper underlying sedimentarv strata, cut into by the
fissures through which the main ducts pass, come into play, and discharge their

contents more or less rapidly into those ducts, where, when the water reaches the

pomt, where the pressure permits, it flashes into steam and rises in vast bubbles of
vapour to the surface of the lava. Of the quantity of this underground water

some notion may be formed by the fact that the deepest of the three springs under
Naples discharged, when first tapped, two cubic metres (440 gallons) per minute.
The water may pass in bodily in consequence of the powerful shocks and vibrations

shattering the strata, and so causing masses of rock to fall in from the sides of

the main duct, together with the water lodged in the beds; or it may pass in by
capillarity, for it is well known that this state exercises a remarkable influence
on the conditions of equilibrium on the two sides of a porous body, and M. Baubree
has shown that water will pass through sandstone against a pressure of steam
greater than that of the column of water. The experiments were only carried to
theextent of a steam-pressure of two atmospheres, but it was evident that the
limits of the power were not reached. They further also showed that heat mate-
                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                    613

rially increased the transmitting power. There is reason therefore to suppose that

water, under the considerable hydrostatic pressuies that exist beneath volcanic

mountains, and assisted by capillarity, may flow into the volcanic ducts with
facility, especially when aided by the intermittent relief of pressure afforded by

the rise and fall, or pulsations, of the column of lava.

    As the underground springs also are exhausted by the expulsion of the laro-e

volumes of water (as aqueous vapour), another agent comes into operation. When

by the continuance of this action, the level of the underground waters in the'
sedimentary strata under the volcano is lowered to below that of the sea-level so

that their hydrostatic pressure is no longer equal to that exercised by the sea-water
the current becomes reversed, and iustead of an outflow from the land, an inflow'
of salt water from the sea necessarily takes place through the same exeurrent

channels, and thus, taking the place of the displaced fresh water, finds its way to
the volcanic ducts. Then, from the exhaustion of the fresh-water supplies and
an impeded access of sea-water, the lava flows quietly and unaccompanied by the
violent explosions which mark the commencement of an eruption. If, on the other
hand, the sea-water gains access more freely through tlie more porous volcanic
materials, it may help to maintain, as in Stromboli and Kilauea, a constant volcanic
activity. In ordinary cases, however, when the inland waters, after the force of

the eruption is expended, regain the ascendant, they again exclude the sea-
water, and return to a state of equilibrium, which lasts until the strata are a-^ain
disturbed and fractured by a renewed eruption of lava.

      In conclusion, the author conceives that the first cause of volcanic action is the
welling up of the lava, in consequence of pressure due to slight contraction of
the earth's crust. Secondly, the fluid lava coming into contact with water stored
in the crevices of the masses of lava and ashes forming the volcano, the water is
at once flashed into steam, giving rise to powerful detonations and explosions.
Thirdly, follows an influx of water from the underlying sedimentary strata into

the ducts of the volcano , and, lastly, as these subterranean bodies of water are thus

converted into steam and expelled, the exhausted strata then serve as a channel to
Aan influx of sea-water into the volcano.
                                                                                       point is finally reached when, owino-

to the cessation of the powerful shocks and vibrations, and the excessive drainage

of the strata, the flow of the lava is effected quietly, and so continues until the

lava ceases to rise.

6. The Connection hehveen the Intrusion of Volcanic Eoch and Volcanic

               Eruptions. By Professor Sollas, M.A., F.E.S.E.

In a volcanic eruption there are concerned, first, the elevation of the lava column

in the axial pipe of the volcano, and next the explosion by which the lava is
ejected into the air. The author attempts to find a vera cmisa for the latter.

Sorby's researches on included cavities prove that steam at a high tension must

have been everywhere present throughout plutouic rocks when these were in a

state of fusion, and the presence of steam in ejected lava is well known. Judd's

researches show that plutonic rocks are in many cases the solidified remains of

deep-seated lava from which volcanoes were supplied. It may therefore be shown

that the axial pipe of a volcano is occupied by fused rocks permeated bv steam,

which is probably in a liquid state, and the tension of which at any point in the

tube will depend on the hydrostatic pressure due to the lava column above it.

Any sudden diminution of this pressure will lead toa sudden expansion of the steam,

and 80 tend to produce a volcanic explosion.

The mere elevation of the lava in the volcanic pipe cannot directly produce a

diminution of pressure, though an overflow at the surface of the ground would;

but this infers that the overflow of lava should precede an eruption, which is not

the case                                         hence the author concludes  that  an  overflow of lava  from  the sides of
                                              ;

the pipe takes place underground, and the pressure on the lava column being re-

duced beneath the point of outflow, an eruption follows. The abundant presence

of intruded sheets and dykes of igneous rock, known to occur beneath volcanic

cpnes, thus stands in close connection with the production of volcanic explosions.

1. On the Ivjluence of Barometric Pressure on the Discharge of Water from
        Sprinys. By Baldwin Latham, M.Inst.G.E., F.G.8., F.M.8.

The author of this paper mentioned that it was alleged, by some of the long-

establisihed millers on the chalk streams, that they were able to foretell the ap-

pearance of rainfall from a sensible increase in the volume of water flowino- down

the stream before the period of rainfall. He had, therefore, undertaken a series

of observations to investigate the phenomena, and he found, in settino- up o-au^es
on the Bourne flow in the Caterham Valley, near Croydon, in the spring of this

year (1881), and selecting periods when there was no rain to vitiate the results,

_that_ whenever there was a rapid fall in the barometer, there was a correspond-

ing increase in the volume of water flowing, and with a rise of the barometer,
there was a diminution in the flow. The fluctuations in the flow of the Croy-
don Bourne, due to barometric pressure, had at one period exceeded half a

million gallons per day. The gaugings of deep wells also confirmed these

observations                                                            for where there was a  large amount of  water held  by capillarity  in
                                                                     ;

the .strata above the water-line, at that period of the year when the w^ells became
sensitive and the flow from the strata was sluggish,' a fall in the barometer co-

incided with a rise in the water-line, and under conditions of high barometric

pressure the water-line was lowered. Percolating gauges also gave similar evi-

dence, for after percolation had ceased and the filter was apparently dry, a rapid

fall of the barometer occurring, a small quantity of water passed from the perco-
lating gauges. The conclusion arrived at was, that atmospheric pressure exercises
a marked influence upon the escape of water from springs. The increase in the
flow of the water was attributed to the expansion and escape of the gases held by
the water under low barometric pressure, which caused the water to escape more

freely, while with high barometric pressure tliere was a condensation and inward

How of the gases which led to a retardation in the flow of the water.

By2. Glacial Sections at TorJc, and their relation to the later deposits.
                        J. Edmund Clark, B.A., B.Sc, F.0.8.

      General Relation.--The York area chiefly consists of Glacial beds, which form
the high ground and cover the various extensive low tracts more or less remote
from theOuse. Glacial depressions have been filled up with brick-earths, and,

in exceptional cases, peat-beds. Where the river channel is narrowed below the

city, the crests of the banks are capped with gravels reaching on the left bank
below the river-level.

     Peff<-Se<fs.--Campleshon Pond and part of St. Paul's Square are peat-beds
where depressions were elevated above the levels covered with brick-earth. The
same explanation may apply to the peat at Messrs. Backhouse's nurseries. But
Askham Bog, li miles long by ^ a mile broad, at the far end of the Hob Moor
deposits, seems to be over a depression so deep and remote that the clay deposits
only partly filled it. Near Ouse Bridge a peat-bed 50 feet down, at Brett's

Brewery, has been called Interglacial ; but the beds above it cannot positively
be asserted to be Glacial ; for at the waterworks similar beds appear, in which

plant-roots were detected 20 feet down. The beds are warpy brick earths, with
some sand in the latter case.

     Brick-earths.--At the Harrogate Signals, \ mile further north, the junction of

the upper beds with Glacial (or probably Glacial) beds is seen; but the change is

almost insensible, although very soon true boulder clays are exposed. The junction
was seen better during the construction of the Foss Islands railway, the brick-
clays at the edge pi the marsh resting against an uneven surface of boulder clay,
whilst for some distance an average of 5 feet of brick-earth covers a surface con-
sisting of uneven boulder clay, half planed down and the hollows filled with sand.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  615

 At a few points bosses of boulder clay protrude even here through the upper bed,
 Tvhilst elsewhere depressions are filled with brick-clays, now extensively worked.

    --Gravels. The gravel beds at Fulford nnd on the opposite side of the Ouse are

  much alike. The latter, however, are placed higher. The beds are irregular, often

  roughly stratified, often with sand-beds and stones, from grit to boulders of a
  quarter-ton weight. The stones are precisely the same as those in the boulder

  clay ; some limestone boulders are still striated. On both sides of the river, 2.5
  feet down at one point in Fulford, a black band of manganese has been found

  yielding on analysis 00 per cent, of manganese dioxide. This looks like soot,
  encrusting usually the upper half of a layer of dry stones, one foot thick. The
  rest and adjacent beds are brown with the sesquioxide, whilst ferrous oxide comes

  just below.

      At the gravel pits now being worked on the Bishopthorpe Road a metatarsal
 ·of Ursus spel<eus (or of the grizzly) was found this spring. There seems to be no

  previous record of any carnivorous remains from this neighbourhood.

    --Glacial Sections. The deepest glacial sections were made in drainage-work

  at the Friends' Retreat, in 1876, a drift, 6-50 feet long, cutting through the hill

 from N.W. by W. to S.E. by E. At the highest point this was 47 feet below

 the surface. Shafts were sunk every 50 feet. Nothing but glacial beds were met,
 tough boulder clays, gravelly beds, and sand-beds. The latter were variously

 inclined and much cut up, rarely continuing any great distance. Indeed every-
 thing pointed to the whole mass being made up of independent parts, heaped and
 piled against each other. The third sand-bed was struck at the fifth shaft, the

 tough clay having been remarkably dry and crumbly for a yard above it, although

 the shaft was flooded with water higher up. At the first tap into the sand there
 "was a great escape of gas, scaring the workmen away altogether for the four or five
 days it lasted. The probable explanation is that the sand-bed was close sealed by
 the clay, with orifices only near the base by which water could enter or leave.
 In dry seasons the line of saturation falling below these, the sand was left dry,
 with air only between the grains. The previous season was very wet ; the line of
 saturation was at least 15 feet above the top of the sand. The contained air,
 unable to escape, was compressed into the upper part and slowly forced upwards
into the boulder clay above until released by the workman's pick. At least 7,000
feet of air must have come off, but probably much more.

     Between Shafts VIII. and IX. boulders were encoimtered by the men too big
 to remove ; they thought some must have been of a ton weight. The largest
 brought up weighed about 600 pounds, which is as much as any I have found
in situ near York, except, possibly, one still to be seen on the Moant. Some of
those in the Museum grounds must weigh more. Among other stones two lumps

of coal were brought up.

    The most extensive series of sections are those on the site of the New Goods

Station. For this a level was obtained 4 acres or so in extent, and 3 to 12 feet
below the old surface. Unfortunately there are no records of the sections made

in this part. Starting from the lower level, a series of sections covering 2^ acres
was obtained about the building, reaching in one or two points 14 feet lower.
These were chiefly exposed in the cellarage at the east endj but drainage and

foundation trenches gave sections of varying depth in all parts. From these it has
been possible to draw up a pretty complete plan of the beds. In the S. W. part

these prove to be alluvial sands and laminated clays, forming a thin coat over the
glacial deposits. Only about 3 feet of soil were removed from the S.W. corner, the

depth increasing from this point. Looking at the ground-plan we are immediately
struck by the regular strike of all the beds from S.E. to N.W. Examining the

more complete sections at the E. end, they are found to consist of series of folds of
clays, sands, and pebbles, resting against one central fold. The black and red
boulder clays share, this peculiarity with the sands. In these last it is more evident
in two of the beds, from the pure black clay coming in bands and masses. The
whole appearance suggests the work of an iceberg, ploughing up from the S.W.
and pushing these beds before it. Diagrams and photographs were exhibited, to

illustrate the characteristic points here indicated.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 :

616 BEPOET 1881.

    On the N. boundary of the area, 25 feet from the east end of these sections,.
200 from the west, the beds are again much contorted. One section showed

a mass of boulders and pebbles near the centre, looking as if tilted off an iceberg.
Another, about 10 yards to the west, showed a sand mass, steep and angular,
as if it had been deposited in one frozen lump. At another section, 200 yards
east, behind the passenger station, contorted beds were again well shown, with
layers of boulders, gravels, &c. Sands among them were very false-bedded.

    The stones found, though including many from the Lake District, chiefly come
from the Carboniferous beds of the West Riding. Limestones are usually
scratched and often beautifully polished. At all the places mentioned occasional
specimens occur from Lias and Oolite beds, so that an easterly drift must have

sometimes counteracted the prevailing set from the west.
     The main glacial beds approach nearest to the Purple Boulder Clay of

Messrs. Searles v. AVood and Plarmer. Floating ice, however, rather thau the
moraine profonde of an ice-sheet, seems best to account for the mixture of tough
boulder-clays with beds of boulders, gravels, and current-bedded sands. At most
sections there are indications that the upper glacial beds belong to a second glacia-
tion, less severe than the principal cold period.

     The post-glacial deposits are worked to depths of .30 feet and more ; in the
river-bed they may exceed 50 feet. The river is now 60 or 70 feet above its pre-
glacial bed, and probably 40 or 50 above the level to which it first cut down in

the opening of the post-glacial epoch.

3. On tJie BrklUngtcn and Dimlingfon Glacial SJiell-beds.
                      By G. W. Lamplugh.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ''

In a section recently exposed in the cliff north of Bridlington, the ' basement

boulder clay was seen to enclose masses of smooth tough clay, light blue or dark

bluish-black in colour, mixed in places with a coarse yellowish-green sand. None

of these masses were large, and most were squeezed out so as to form streaks or

lenticular patches. Nearly all contained shells, some of which were unbroken,

but more were crushed, and the fragments dragged apart as if by shearing. Fora-

minifera were also present. The well-known bed, a few hundred yards to the south,

from which the Arctic shells were obtained, seems, from the description given, to

have been a similar, though larger, mass. Of the twenty-eight species of mollusca

collected from these patches, four are not included in the published lists of the

Bridlington shells ; viz. Hissoa Wyville-Thomsmii, Menestho alhula^ Leda tenuis,

and Leda lentinda.

The surrounding boulder clay also contains many shells, chiefly fragmentary,

derived apparently from the same source, as under many of the unbroken valves

there still remains a little coarse sand, and of the twenty-five species identified,

only one species and one variety are not included in the published list, viz

MyaPecten opereidaris and  fmncata, var. TJddevalJensis.

At Dimlington, near Spurn, the same shelly boulder clay is again seen, and

contains similar patches of mingled sand and clay, with broken and unbroken

shells, Of the twenty-six species obtained from this locality, all except two are

included in the Bridlington list. The exceptions are Thracia pid)esce)is and

Cardium Gresnlandieum.

In Filey Bay, on the beach opposite the village of Keighton, another of the

same shelly blue boulder clay was seen, containing similar clay streaks with

crushed shells.

    This bed forms part only of the 'basement clay' of Messrs. Wood and Rome,

as those gentlemen have included in their division a massive grey chalky boulder

clay, with very few shell-fragments, which irregularly overlies the shelly clay at

Dimlington, but is not seen at Bridlington.

As the shelly clay extends to low water both at Bridlington and Dimlington,

its thickness and the character of the underlying beds are unknown.

     It appears to be the remains of an arctic sea-bottom, which was first covered

with fine glacial mud and then ploughed up and destroyed by ice.

4. On Sections of the Drift ohtained from the new Drainage Works of
                            Driffield.^ By J. R. Mortimer.

    The plan and sections of the Driffield drains cover an area of forty acres, show-
ing a length of six miles. The noticeable feature is the complicated interbedding
of sand and gravel with boulder clay.

     The gravels consist almost entirely of waterworn pieces of chalk of small size,
though foreign boulders are occasionally present ; and the fact that both chalk and
boulders are frequently found standing on end shows that they must hare been
dropped into their position by ice.

     The dovetailing of the chalk gravels with the boulder clay is confined to a
narrow zone, bounded by the chalk hills on the one side, and on the other by a
series of mounds and ridges, distant from the chalk one mile at Bridlington, and
five at Hull. The mounds are not moraines, but due, the author thinks, to the
melting of stranded ice-rafts bearing sand and gravel. They exhibit every variety
of false bedding, due to rearrangement by tides, and are capped by an unstratified
boulder clay. The remarkable features shown in the sections are due to ice action

-- --the land ice bringing down fresh supplies of chalk the sea-borne ice ploughing

up the clays and preventing the escape of the gravels. Many instances can be given

of chalk crushed and removed by ice.
     The author considers that an ice-cap covered the chalk hills, filling up the

Talleys, and preventing subaerial denudation, and that the drift which fills up old
preglacial valleys in the neighbourhood of the present coast never extended far
inland, as no trace of it is to be found in any of the dales.

      In tracing the position of the chalk gravel, the author calls attention to the
striking fact that chalk boulders south of Hornsea contain hlack flints, which are

never found in the Yorkshire chalk, and which must have come from Norway.
The flints north of Hornsea are more of the Yorkshire type, and were probably
derived from Flambro' Head.

5. On the Subsidences above the Permian Limestone between Hartlepool
    and Ripon. By A. G. Cameron, Geological Survey of England and

      Wales.

     In this paper attention is drawn to the numerous fonns of shrinkages of the

land-surface, often extending to considerable depths into the rocks beneath,
observable over the top of the Permian rocks betwixt Hartlepool and Eipon.

    As a general explanation of their origin, it is suggested that where the under-

ground water, flowing over the limestone surface, reaches the margin of the sand-
stone, it receives a check, whereby it accumulates, forming a chain of dams or
pools along the line of junction of these rocks.

    As denudation proceeds, hollows form above and below, until ultimately the

   --The conclusions arrived at from the facts are

      1st. That the boulder clays were formed in the sea, partly hy glacial action and

--partly hy icebergs. The occurrence of boulders from distant localities often in
--very different directions in a matrix partaking of the character of the underlying

 rocks, is explained in an entirely new way.

      2nd. That the middle sands and gravels are the result of marine and river

 action combined.

      ·3rd. That the mounds of sand and gravel occurring in the mouths of valleys
were accumulated by floating ice, from pre-existing deposits.

    A new explanation was given of the occurrence of boulders at higher levels than

 the rocks from which they were derived.

7. On Simosaurus pusillm (Fraas), a step in the Evolution of the Plesio.
               sauria. By Professor H, G. Seeley, F.E.S., F.L.8.

     The author gave a detailed description of the skeleton of Simosaurus, recently
discovered in the Trias near Stuttgard, and briefly noticed and figured by Dr.

Oscar Fraas. He then drew special attention to the differences from plesiosaurus,

especially in the form of the pectoral arch, and in the characters of the fore and
hind limbs.

    Hence we see in Simosaurus a land animal in process of adaptation to natatory
conditions. The width of the humerus appears to have relation to a lateral flexure
of the fore limb, by which the bone became the chief agent in movement on land
and as the land-progression was not entirely lost, the fore arm had not become
reduced in length to the plesiosaurian form. The small number of phalanges was
similarly explained. The hiud limb was discussed to show how it might assume
like characters with the fore limb. The author concludes that the plesiosauri

were originally land animals, and that their ancestors and affinities must be sought
in Simosaurus, Nothosaurus, and allied types of amphibious Triassic reptiles.

8. 071 a restoration of the skeleton of Archceopteryx, with some remarks on

      the cUferences between the Berlin and London specimens. By Professor

       H. G. Seeley, F.B.8., F.L.S.

The author, by tracing the forms of the bones from a photograph, arranged the

skeleton so as to represent a bird which stood about ten inches high. The head

has a post-occipital process similar to that which occurs at a separate bone in the

cormorant                                           the neck is curved  forward ;  the  tail                                                                                                  reached  almost  to  the  ground,
                                                 ;

and the limbs were carried exactly as in birds.

The Berlin fossil certainly belongs to a distinct species ; almost as certainly to

a distinct genus, and is probably the type of a distinct family of saururous birds.
The author did not name the fossil, believing that duty to devolve upon the writer

who may hereafter figure and describe this fossil.

       BrocJcenhurst, Habits. By Professor P. Martin Duncan, F.B.S.

   The museum of the Philosophical Society of York contains, thanks to the industry

and generosity of Mr. E.eed, a very interesting series of corals from Brockenhurst
                                                                --

in the New Forest. Nearly all the species of the Oligocene coral fauna of that

"part of England, which were described in the publications of the Paljeontographi-

cal Society, are present in Mr. Reed's collection, and there is one form in addition

·which is very remarkable.

      Description of the corallum.

      The corallum is simple, cup-shaped, narrow, and rounded at the base, which

was free, and it is wide and open, and rather triangular at the calice, whose margins

are slightly inverted, except at the angles.

    An epitheca exists. The costse, where visible, are alternately large and small,

but always slender. There is much exotheca between the costa3.

      The calice is rather deep, and, judging from the structure of the base of the

corallum, the columella is small and tubercular. The septa are numerous, not

·exsert, slender, unequal, granular at the sides, and there are four cycles and part

of a fifth.

      The pali are distinct, bilobar, rounded or arched above, and as broad as the septal

ends, and granular. There are three crowns or circles of pali : one before the

primary, and others before the secondary and tertiary septa, and the septa of higher

orders have none ; the largest are in one circle and the smallest in another,
which is placed remote from the columellary space. The circle of pali before the

tertiary septa is intermediate in position between the others. The height of the

specimen is two centimetres, and the extreme breadth of the calice is 2'5 centi-

metres.

   --Remarhs. This is an aporose coral with the very rare combination of exotheca,

--endotheca, and pali a combination not hitherto observed in any British Island

-coral, which onlj' occurs in the coral fauna of the miocene of the Antilles, and

in the fauna of the deep sea of the Caribbean region.

      In investigating the corals from the miocene reefs of the West Indies, I de-

scribed a form which had the exothecal and endothecal structures and pali, and

Aplaced it in a new genus, Asterosmilia ('Phil. Trans.' 1867).  year or two since

the late Count de Pourtales proved that the genus is extant, for he dredged up a

species and described it.

     But the species of the genus Asterosmilia had only pali before two orders of
septa. The presence of a third crown of pali is not, according to the analogy

of other genera, sufficient to remove the coral form, obtained at Brockenhurst, now

under consideration, from the genus Asterosmilia (mihi), and I therefore name the

species after the geologist to whom the museum at York is so greatly indebted

Asterosmilia Reedi.

      The other species of coral which were associated with Asterosmilia Reedi in the

deposit at Brockenhurst belong to such very tropical genera as Madrepora and
SolenastriBa, and the members of the family Eupsamminse, whose modern represen-

tatives are both deep and shallow water forms.

      I would especially draw attention to the dimensions of a specimen oi Madrepora

Anfflica, nob., from Brockenhurst, for it is a large piece of a vigorously-grown per-

forate coral whose modern representatives onl}^ flourish in less than twenty

fathoms, and in a temperature of the sea higher than the mean of 72° F. Such a
Madrepora would now grow on a shallow bank or on the flank of a reef of coral.
The Brockenhurst specimens of Madrepora have been rolled and worn since death,

but not for any great distance, for the tissue of the coral was fragile in the extreme.
But the Asterosmilia and one specimen of an Eupsammine especiallj^ do not in-

dicate, from their state of preservation, that they have been rolled. They lived and

died not far from where they were found, and they may have lived at any depth

within or beyond twenty fathoms. Probably not far below the lowest spring-

tide level was their habitat, but it is possible that they may have had a deeper

one.

In conclusion, it is necessary to remind those geologists who take an interest

in the physical geography of the period when nummulites were dying out, that

vast structures of Oligocene coral limestone were then forming in Northern Italy,
and the Austrian Alps, and that a great coral fauna prevailed west of the Indus.

2. On the Strata, hetiveen the Ghillesford Beds and, the Lower Boulder Glay^

   ' The Mundesley and Westleton Beds.'' Bij Professor J. Prestwich^

    M.A., F.B.8.,

    Where a particulai" series of strata presents, in adjacent and conterminous areas,,
markedly different palaeontological and lithological characters, it may be sometimes-
convenient, as in the case of the ' Reading- and Woolwich Series,' to give them a

double geographical term, indicative of the localities where each type is well-
developed, and its relation to the overlying and underlying strata well shown.

     The beds between the Ghillesford Clay and the Lower Boulder Clay present

such a series. Its exhibition on the coast of Norfolk, although very limited, is-
accompanied by special palaeontological features, that have caused it to be divided

into the number of local beds which have been described by Trimmer, Green,,
Gunn, Wood, and Havmer, the author, Reid, Blake, and others. It includes the
' Laminated Clays,' the ' Elephant ' and ' Forest beds ' of Gunn, the ' Bure Valley
Crag ' of S. Wood, the ' Westleton Shingle ' of the author, and the ' Rootlet-bed
of Blake. Without reverting at present to the exact correlation of the several
beds in the Norfolk area, respecting which there is still some difference of opinion,
the author suggests that they should all be included under a general term founded

on the localities where, on the one hand, their varied paheontological characters are

--exhibited, and on the other, where their peculiar lithological characters are well-

marked characters which the author proposes to show, in another paper, have a
very wide range, and serve to mark an important geological horizon affecting some

interesting questions of local physical geology.

     The Mundesley beds were described by the author in 1860, and consist of
alternating beds of clay, sands, and shingle, some containing freshwater and othera
marine mollusca, with a forest-growth and mammalian remains at their base

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and again in 1871, when he included them in his Westleton group (No. 5 of his
sections), which he showed at that place to consist entirely' of great masses of

well-rounded shingle, with intercalated seams containing traces only of marine-
shells. Seeing the inconvenience of attaching the same term to the two very

distinct series of beds, and that it may conflict with other local terms, the author
now proposes to group this series under the term of ' The Mundesley and Westle-

ton Beds,' indicative of their stratigraphical position in Norfolk, and of characters
in Suffolk which serve to identify them in their range westward and inland to

considerable distances beyond the Crag area. At the same time, it maybe conve-

nient, for brevity, to use one term only in speaking of typical cases.

3. On the Extension into Essex, Middlesex, and other Inland Counties, of the

     Mundesley and Westleton Beds, in relation to the age of certain hill-

    gravels and of some of the valleys of the Souf/i, of England. By

      Professor J. Prestwich, M.A., F.B.8.

     The author gives in this paper the result of observations commenced more than
30 years since, but delayed publication partly in consequence of the complexity
of some of the phenomena. As mentioned in the preceding paper, a peculiar
group of land, freshwater, and marine beds occupy, on the Norfolk coast, a zone
between the Ghillesford Clay and the Lower Boulder Clay. As we proceed south-
ward, the land and freshwater conditions are gradually eliminated, and marine-
conditions there alone prevail. Poorly marked as the marine evidence is in Suffolk,
this evidence is entirely wanting further inland, and we have only levels, super-
position, and structure to rely on in correlating the fragmentary outliers into which
these beds finally resolve themselves. Again on the coast of the Eastern counties,

this group forms a nearly level plane but little above the sea-level, resting every-
where on an undisturbed or very slightly eroded bed of Ghillesford Clay, and

being succeeded, with but slight evidence of denudation, by the Lower Boulder
Clay, or by the Glacial sands and gravel ; whereas, as it trends inland, it attains a
                                                                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            621

·considerable elevation above the sea-level, passes unconformabl}' over the older Ter-
tiary strata, and was, with them, subjected to a great amount of denudation before

the deposition of the succeeding Glacial series. On the other hand, the old land,

-which seems to have extended westward from the Norfolk coast, is now in great
'part below the level of the German Ocean. Further, whereas the succeeding
·Glacial beds all show a drift from northward to southward, this is the only case
that has come under the author's notice of a marine drift from southward to the

northward.

       The Westleton Beds, in their more typical aspect, consist of quartzose sands

full of flint-pebbles, almost as much worn and as numerous as in the Lower
-- ATertiary sands of Blackheath. With these are mixed (1) good many small
white and rose-coloured quartz-pebbles                                                                                                                                                                                            Pebbles of Lydian stone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;  (2)                                                                                                                                          :  (3) Large

flattened pebbles of a light-coloured quartzite ; and (4) Rolled and worn fraoinents

of Lower Greensand chert. It is the presence of these, and especially of the last,

that constitutes so marked a feature of these beds, and together with the absence of

pebbles and rock-fragments of northern origin, serves to separate them from the

Inter-glacial sands and shingle with which in places they come into juxtaposition.

       The author then proceeds to trace the beds through Essex, and gives a series of

railway sections showing these beds, exhibiting usually the appearance of a white

gravel, with intercalated ochreous beds, and reposing on a very eroded surface of

-the London Clay. Near Clare there is a pit in which they exhibit oblique lamina-

tion, and might, apart from the want of fossils, be mistaken for a Crag section.

Near Braintree, a remarkable section was exposed in the branch railway to that

<town. It showed these beds much faulted, overlain irregularly by a darker bed

full of the New Eed Sandstone quartzite pebbles, and the whole covered by

indenting Boulder Clay.

     In following the beds further westward they undergo further modification.

Certain characters remain, however, persistent, and on these we have to rely.

1st, the shingle is composed essentially of chalk-flint pebbles, becoming less worn
aswe approach the southern limits of the deposit ; 2ndly, it often becomes much
mixed with flint- pebbles and subangular fragments of compact sandstone derived
from the underlying Tertiary strata ; 3rdly, the Greensand chert and ragstone

[fragments often so increase in numbers as to constitute a large portion of the
gravel. They are worn and subangular, and the chert is identical with the chert
of the Lower Greensand of Kent and Surrey; 4thly, the pebbles of white and

rose-coloured quartz, of Lydian stone, and of whitish quartzite become rarer, and

in places are wanting. The Lydian stone and some of the small quartz pebbles
may be derived, with the chert, from the Lower Greensand, but this will not
account for the great number of quartz pebbles found in the Eastern counties.
The quartzite pebbles are as large but lighter-coloured and more ovoid than

those of the New Red. They probably have drifted from a continental area

on the east, the author having found similar beds in parts of Belgium, othly,
the absence of northern drift.

It is to this age that the author would refer the drift gravel capping some

of the higher ground in Epping Forest, and also the Middlesex hills "around

Barnet and Southgate, and extending thence in outliers to the range of hills
between Hertford and Hatfield, South Mimms and St. Albans, and possibly as

far north as_ Tj'ler's Hill, near Chesham. Ranging further westward, it forms

a small capping on Horsington Hill, near Harrow, which serves to connect it with

Its high level on Bowsey Hill, near Henley-on-Thames. Southward, it caps

St. George's Hill, near Weybridge. Approaching its southern boundarv, this

drift becomes less worn and passes into a subangular flint-gravel, capping several

of the hills south of the Thames. At Cherry Down, near Windsor, it consists in

large part of subangular fragments of chert and ragstone. It caps Iluno-ary Hill,

near Farnham , another hill west of Cajsar's Camp, near Bagshot; Meadow "Down,

near Guildford                                                                        and  Pobly Hill, near Dorking, and                                                                                                          some  others.  To this period

     The author reserves for another occasion the description of the beds next in
order; but he would mention here, that the Boulder Clay and some Glacial gravels
occupy in Herts and Berks a lower horizon than the Westleton Beds. It would
therefore appear that, while the eastern area was submerged, and the strata
followed in regular succession upon a surface which did not undergo denudation,
the southern and western area was slowly elevated, and underwent partial denuda-
tion before the Upper Boulder Clay was deposited. Previous to the period of the
Westleton and Mundesley beds, it is probable that the deeper denudation of the
"Weald had hardly commenced. The northern part of this area was imder the
sea at the beginning of the Cra? period (the Lenham Beds), and judging from
the character of the beds at Well Hill^ Cherry Down, &c., the author concludes
that there was land south of this fringing shingle, whence the great mass of Chalk-
fiints and of Lower Greensand chert and ragstone must have been derived. The
quantity of this debris serves to attest to the great mass of these strata that was
subsequently removed from the Wealden area. After the rise of the more
central and northern parts of the area over which the Westleton Beds extended,
that area also underwent extensive denudation, and it was at this period that the
great plain of the Thames Valley received its first outlines, although it was not
until much later that the river valley received its last impress.

A4. preliminary account of the worlcing of DowTcerhottom Gave, in Craven^

              during August, 1881.' Bij E. B. Poulton, M.A., F.G.8.

Dowkerbottom Cave is 1,250 feet above the sea, between Arncliffe and Kilnsey.

Its mouth is merely a fall in the roof of the cave, which stretches from either end
of the fissure thus formed. The original mouth is not now visible, but is probably

to be found at the foot of a slope to the south. During most of its course the

chambers and passages of the cave are not separated by any great thickness of rock

from the ground above, and thus other falls must be expected to occur. The

--eastern division of the cave is about 4o0 feet long and has three fine chambers

separated by two passages the first very short and the second very long. This

division ends under high ground to the north-west, and the true mouth must be

--in the other or western division. The last chamber on the eastern side is charac-

terised by mechanical deposits blocks of limestone fallen from the roof, and a

stiff" brown clay beneath. In the other chambers and passages of both sides are

--chemical deposits hard and soft stalagmite. The western division is smaller, but

also contains three chambers and two passages. It must be about 350 feet long

and contains various heaps of limestone blocks fallen from the roof, but no clay on

the surface. In former workings by JMr. Farrer, Mr. Denny, and Mr. Jackson, the

first chambers were explored, in their surface layers at least, and here were found

the numerous metal and bone ornaments and implements, together with the bones

of animals usually found (in the historic layers of Romano-British age) in caves.

The second passages have also been worked, and part of the second chamber on

the eastern side. Other parts of the cave appear to be quite untouched. The

great difficulty in working the cave is the removal of the dehris to prevent inter-

Wefering with further work.          therefore put up a windlays over the eastern

entrance, and cleared a way for barrows through the talus below. Beneath the

talus, the black earth, in which remains had been previously found, was seen, and

many articles of Roman age were taken from it. Chamber III. was marked into

--parallels and these into squares. In the centre we sunk a shaft and passed through

the following layers :

     (1) Romano-British layer, a black earth with pottery, ornaments,? &c., and
numerous bones, from one to nine inches thick. (2) Hardish stalaf/mite, about

six inches thick : in one place containing the bones of a dog or small wolf. (3>

Soft stalagmite, four inches thick. (4) Hardish stalarimite, six inches thick.

(5) Soft stalapiiiife, two feet six inches thick. (6) Stiff brown clay with large

angular blocks of limestone fallen from the roof firmly imbedded in it. This layer

was eight feet deep, as far as we saw it. The last two feet are laminated and
contain smaller blocks. At the depth of about twelve feet from the surface we
came to part of the solid limestone tlooror side of the cave, sloping steeply down-

wards. There were no indications of a change in the nature of the deposit at the

junction with the limestone, and the clay appears to extend much deeper than the
level at present reached. Thus below the stalagmite purely mechanical deposits

succeed, and no limestone blocks are found above this horizon, although the stalag-

mite has been removed over a large part of the floor of the chamber. No traces of

a fauna have been as yet found below the first hardish stalagmite ; indeed all the

deposits passed through below the stalagmite indicate the former presence of a
still lake in which the great thickness of clay slowly accumulated. Further work
was stopped by the heavy rain which flooded the shaft dug in the clay. It is in-

teresting to note that the former condition of Chamber II. is identical with the
present state of the third chamber in the preponderance of mechanical over
chemical deposits. The change from mechanical to chemical deposits was pro-
bably produced by a change from accumulation in still water to accumulation

in running water. Possibly also the absence of blocks fallen from the roof in the

stalagmite may be due to the bicarbonate of lime contained in the water, which
percolated through the roof, cementing together the limestone blocks. The absence
of this cement when the clay was deposited may be due to the absence of solvent

power in the water which then percolated through the roof. For no carbon

--dioxide would be evolved from a soil deficient in organic matter as the soil cover-

ing the Yorkshire hills for a period long after the Glacial period must have been.

I wish to express my best thanks to J. R. Tennant, Esq., of Kildwick Hall, Leeds,

and to J. R. Eddy, Esq., of Carleton, Skipton, on behalf of the Duke of Devonshire,
for their kind permission to work the cave, and especially for the kind help and
advice that Mr. Eddy has given all through the work. I also wish to heartily
thank those gentlemen who have helped me in the work itself.

 3. On the Formation of Coal. By Edward "Wethered, F.G.8., F.C.S.

     The author first reviewed the researches of Hutten, Goeppert, MacCulloch,

Sir James Hall, Sir W. Logan, and Dr. Dawson, and then summed up the con-

clusions now entertained as to the formation of coal, as follows :

     First, That the beds of fireclay which underlie all seams of coal, represent the
original land-surfaces upon whicli the coal-forming vegetation grew. 2nd. That
the Stigmaria found in the underclays were the roots of that vegetation, which
implies that the plants were of the Lepidodendroid order. 3rd. That the vegeta-
tion grew near the mouths of great rivers, in swampy ground, and there under-
Avent submergence ; changes then took place which converted the vegetable matter

into coal. 4th. That the change of coal from one variety to another, even in the

same seam, is the result of metamorphism, and is indirectly caused by the contortion

of the surrounding strata, whereby facilities for the escape of gases evolved by

--the vegetable decomposition have been produced.
     The author's exceptions to the above were 1st. That coal was not formed from

vegetation of the Lepidodendroid type, and that therefore the stigmaria found in

the underclays are not the roots of the vegetation which gave rise to the coal,

ainless it was from the spores of these plants, which the author considered by no

means proved, though coal undoubtedly did contain spores. 2nd. That the varieties

of coal, and the change which sometimes takes place in one and the same seam, are

not due to metamorphism, nor are they dependent upon the contorted state of the

surrounding strata, but arise from the greater or less chemical decomposition of the

vegetable mass, influenced by the circumstances under which it was submerged.

  --The reasons which had led up to these conclusions were : 1st. That we

'have proof of other vegetation during the coal-period besides the Lepidodendroids,

but their roots have not been preserved, owing to their being of a more perishable

nature than the Stigmaria. 2nd. Beds of underclay are frequently met with, full

of Stigmaria, but are not followed by seams of coal. 3rd. Coal must have been

'formed from a compact mass of vegetation, such as could not have been produced

by large trees (as the Lepidodendroids were) growing in situ. The uniform thickness

and comparative freedom from inorganic contamination, would demand a mass of

·vegetation into which only a limited amount of sediment could penetrate. 4th. The

mfinding of a fossil tree standing situ, upon which so much stress had been laid

by some authors, is a rarity. Though the author had spent much time under-

ground in collieries, and seen hundreds of fossil trees drifted into the position in

which they have been found, he had only twice seen instances of them standing

where they have grown. 5th. If seams of coal were formed from Lepidodendroid trees

the tough bast layer would be easily detected, which has never been the case in

any true bed of coal. 6th. If the Stigmaria found in the underclays represent the

roots of the coal- forming vegetation, we should e.xpect to find the fructifications

immediately over the coal, which is not the case ; with the exception of Cordaites

(which in the author's opinion was a Reed), remains of the fossil flora are not found

for the first two feet or so over the coal.

     After a careful investigation underground of the conditions under which coal

--was formed the author has arrived at the following conclusions : On the land

grew the vegetation of the period, represented by the Lepidodendrons, Sigillaria,

Calamites, &c. As the land sank and tlie waters encroached, the land vegetation
gradually disappeared, but the roots remained in many cases, and those which

offered the greatest resistance to decay are the ones preserved in a fossil state

hence the occurrence of Stigmaria. As the waters advanced, the ground would

become swampy, and then we might expect to see spring up reeds, mosses, and

other  vegetation  suitable to  the  changed  condition                                       it  is  to  vegetation of this
                                                                                           ;

kind that the author ascribes the formation of coal.

Reference was then made to the Presidential address of Professor Ramsay to

the British Association in 1880, in which the recurrence of the same kind of

incident through geological time was advocated. The author then asked, why the

coal-formations of the Carboniferous period should be an exception, seeing that the

modern lignites and deposits of peat were instances of coal in the process of for-

mation. It was then pointed out that these deposits were not composed of large

trees, but of a lower order of plants.

     Coming to the varieties of coal and the change which sometimes takes place in
this respect in one and the same seam, it was shown that the difference between

bituminous and anthracite coal was, that the latter contained a greater proportion

of carbon and a less amount of volatile matter than the former. It was then con-

tended that if the decomposition of the coal-forming vegetation took place without

being affected, to any extent, by minerals capable of oxidising the carbon, that a

coal would be formed having a large proportion of carbon with a less proportion of
volatile matter than is found in bituminous coals. The author explained this by

Ijriefly reviewing the process by which vegetable matter has been converted into
                                                                                       ;

coal. It chiefly depended upon the amount of oxygen which could unite with the
carbon, forming carbonic acid, and the amount of hydrogen which could unite with

the carbon to form marsh gas. By this process oxygen and, hydrogen would pass

oft" in greater proportion than the carbon, thus increasing the proportion of the

latter to the whole. If, however, the submerging waters placed in contact with
the vegetable mass substances capable of supplying oxygen to the carbon, then
there would be a decrease in the proportion of the latter, and what the author
termed the ' fixed oxygen and hydrogen ' would increase in proportion to the
whole and give rise to a coal of a bituminous nature.

     With a view of ascertaining whether the chemical composition of the beds
overlying a seam of coal which has changed from bituminous to anthracite
also changed, the AVelsh ' nine feet ' seam was selected, which near Cardiff" is

semi-bituminous and at Aberdare becomes anthracitic. Specimens of the overlyino-

strata were selected from the two districts at each foot above the coal for five feet
these were analysed, and it was found that the beds from near CardiflP were con-
siderably more argillaceous and, as a whole, less ferruginous than those at Aber-
dare. It would be rash to attempt to determine the exact chemical nature of the
sediment deposited over the coal-forming vegetation in the two localities, as, with
the exception of silicate of alumina, the silicates and other minerals would have
undergone decomposition at the expense of the carbonic acid given off from the

coal-forming vegetation. There was, however, a decided change in the beds of the
two sections presented, which could not be ascribed to metamorphism. It rather

appeared to point to the sediment containing difl^erent constituents, which must
have had a very considerable eff'ect on the vegetable mass. It was to this that the
author was inclined to assign the change in the character of the coal.

4. Preliminary RemarJcs on the Microscopic Structure of Coal.

            Bij Professor W. C. Williamson, F.B.S.

    At the two first meetings of the British Association at York and Oxford in
1 831 and 1832, two papers were read on coal and coal-plants, by the late Henry

Witliam. Since that time comparatively little progress has been made in our
knowledge of the structure and physical composition of coal. Many local and limited
observations have been made by Dawson, Huxley, and others, but the results have
been indefinite if not contradictory. The author aims at bringing our knowledge
of coal to a more advanced state by commencing a systematic series of microscopic

observations of the coals of the entire world so far as he can obtain possession of

them. Many months of such observations have been devoted to the coals of

Eastern Scotland and to those of South Wales. These inquiries, thouo-h so

limited, have suggested the possibility of certain conclusions being ultimately

--arrived at; but at present they are only advanced as hypothetical ones though
Athey appear to be supported by the investigations already completed.
                                                                       large

proportion of the coals examined contains mineral charcoal or mother coal in
various conditions ; sometimes the fragments are gathered together in thick layers

of considerable extent, at others they are thin and limited in their area. Frequently

separate fragments are isolated in the bituminous mass which encloses them. In a
large number of instances, portions of each fragment can readily be detached for
microscopic examination, but in many cases the fragments have become so con-

solidated and blended with the mass of the coal as to be incapable of such

separation. All these fragments exhibit a fibrous aspect when seen under low
powers, as opaque objects, but under lenses of higher power and with transmitted
light, they resolve themselves into two groups : one of these consists of frao-ments
of what are more or less bast-like, prosenchymatous tissues, and bear the aspect
of cortical structures. The others, on the other hand, belong to the fibro-

vascular group of tissues, exhibiting in the same minute portion of a fragment

various modifications of such tissues from those that are scalariform to fibres
with bordered discs. The most numerous are such as approach the latter more
nearly than the former type. These fibro-vascular structures bear no resemblance

whatever to those of either Lepidodendroid and Sipilhirian plants, or to those of

ferns ; they approach much more closely to the mixed forms seen in the Cycadese,

to -which group of plants they most probahly belong.
      Intervening between these layers of charcoal tire laj'ers of a wholly different

character. These consist of the more bituminous portions of the coal which are
separable into two elements i.e. one or more forms of spores in varying, but
most frequently vast, numbers, embedded in a matrix, usually of a dark brown
colour when ground sufficiently thin to admit of light being transmitted through
it. In most of the coals examined the spores are of two kinds, as shown by
Huxley, Dawson, and others, the larger ones, which are macrospores, having

even been figured by Witham in his work on the structure of fossil plants.
The smaller ones are doubtless true microspores, and, as might be expected, are
much more numerous than the macrospores.

   A second and far less numerous group of bods occurs amongst the coals of

Eastern Scotland. These are, the 'Paraffin,' ' Parrot,' or ' Gas ' coals. So far as
observations have proceeded, these coals display no signs of the presence of mineral

charcoals, and they are entirely devoid of macrospores. On the other hand they

are densely crowded with small spores imdistinguishable from the microspores of

the ordinary coals. Such examples also are much less laniinated than are the

heterosporous coals.

     That the combined macrospores and microspores of these latter coals are
Lycopodiaceous, there appears little reason to doubt. The nature of the spores in
the Parrot or isosporous coals is much less obvious.

     The nature of the brown plasma in which these spores are embedded is open to
question. The author is inclined to think that it is the resultant of the vegeta-
tive tissues of the various Lepidodendroid and other cryptogamic plants which
constituted the great Carboniferous forest, but which were much moi-e liable to
decay than were either their own spores or than the supposed Cycadean tissues
which constituted the mineral charcoal. The author, however, only advances
these views as working hypotheses, which may either be confirmed or modified
as he advances with his investigations.

5. Oil the Halifax Hard Seam. Bij W. Cash, F.G.S.

The Coal-measures in the district around Halifax belong to the lower portion

of the Ganister Beds, and, lying conformably upon the Rough Rock, which is the

uppermost bed of the Millstone-grit series, attain, to the east of the town, a thick-

ness of about 500 feet.

The measures are capped by the Elland flagstone, and the following is the

order of superposition :

     The two thickest beds, and indeed, the only workable beds of this series are
those known as the Halifax Soft Bed, which is about 18 inches thick, and' the
Halifax Hard Seam, which averages about 2 feet 3 inches. The latter bed is
covered by some 10 feet of shales containing- nodules, locally known as ' bauni

pots,' which are composed chieHy of carbonate of lime with a smaller amount of

carbonate of mngnesin, oxide and sulphide of iron, sulphates of soda and potasli,

and  silica                           the  nodular  concretions  are  very  hard,                                                               and    often  coated  with      iron

pyrites. When they are broken up they are usually found to contain fossil shells

(Xautilus, Orthoceras, Goniatites, Aviculopecten, &c.). Sometimes also fish-scales'

and fossil-wood (Dadoxylon). The bed underlying these shales is the Halifax

Hard Semi, and consists of an impure coal containing numerous nodules of sim"ilar

composition to those which are found in the overlying shales, but containing in

the place of fossil-shells the remains of plants only. These remains consist of

stems, roots, rootlets, branchlets, sporangia, spores, &c., mixed together confusedly
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Williamson, have thrown no small light on some of the difficult problems of

Carboniferous Pakeo-botany.

     Perhaps the last addition of interest to this important local fossil florals a fra-^-
ment of a fossilised stem or branchlet which differs in some important particulars

from anything previously met with. It consists of a central pith surrounded by a
narrow zone of vascular or fibro-vascular tissue, outside which is a cambium rino-
followed by a comparatively thick cortex. This cortex has a very peculiar oro-am-

zation, which, among living plants, is only met with in such" aquatic forms as

Mi/nophi/llum, Utricularia, and a few others. The cortical structures of the fossil

specimen agree most with those                              of  MyriophyUum                                                                     and tliough in the  present  state  of

              6. Researclies in Fossil Botany. By James Spencer,

    During last winter I discovered two new spore-bearing capsules in the coal-ball

material of the Halifax coal strata.

    1. One of these contained some of the spores described by Professor W. C

Williamson, under the name of Zygosporites brevipes.

     This sporangium forms another"link in the history of these remarkable spores
and indicates that they are of lycopodaceous origin, and that they probably belonir

to some unknown form of Lepidodendroid plant.

                                                                            ss2

       It is of an oblong oval form, and about ^^^ of an incli in breadth, by o^ of an inch
 in length. The contained spores are of the usual kind.

     2. New sporangium, containing minute fringed macrospores.

      The other sporangium contains an undescribed species of tetraspores. It is of
 the same form as the one containing Z. brevipes, but very much smaller, being only
 jl^ of an inch in breadth, by -g'^ of an inch in length. The contained spores are
 very minute and covered with hair-like appendages. They resemble the large
 fringed macrospore§, so common in the same material, but they are more of a
 triangular, cockle-shell form. Minute as they are, several hundreds being pro-

 bably contained in each sporangium, they are as perfect in form and as beautifully

 preserved as it is possible for them to be. What are these spores ? Judging from

 their peculiar form and fringe-like appendages, I think it much more probable that
 they are macrospores than microspores, and that they belong to some unknown

 form of Lepidodendron.

    A3. new fossil fungus.

     The fact of the existence of fungi among the plants of tlie coal-measures is now

 well established. I liave upwards of fifty microscopical preparations containing

these fossil parasites. Peronosporites antiquarius is one of the most common

 forms, and is chiefly found in the fossil ferns and in the lepidodendra. Its

mycelia may be often seen crowding the large vessels in the centre of the fern-stems
and sending off branches among the surrounding parenchyma, where its spores

sometimes occur in abundance. Its resting and other spores, along with those of

«ystopus and other forms, occur plentifully in many sections of the coal-ball mate-

rial. Some of my sections of Lyginodendron contain numbers of spore-like bodies,

which greatly resemble starch-grains, but the fact, that many of them have short

thread-like tails, proves that they are not starch-grains. In the longitudinal sec-

tion of a calamite I have found them associated with true mycelia. In one case
there are two branching mycelia, each occupying the centre of one of the long
tube-like vessels, with only a single vessel betwixt them, and surrounded by
the spore-like bodies (haustoria). In its appearance and habits this fossil fungus
is almost exactly like that of the recent species, Oystopus candidus. 1 have no
.doubt that it is a cystopus, and if not the identical species G. candidus, it is at
Jeast a near relation. I propose to give the fossil fungus the provisional name of

Cystopus carbonarius.

7, Notes on Astromyelon and its root. Bij James Spencek.

This fossil plant is one of the new genera which have been described by Professor

W. C. Williamson, F.E.S. It was so named from the star-like form of its pith ;

but since the name was given, many specimens have been found, especially in our

Halifax beds, differing widely from the typical form, so that the name has now to

be applied to specimens which have no pith, and to others in which the starlike

Aaspect is by no means .apparent.  transverse section of the stem bears a striking

resemblance to that of the calamite, but there are several important differences

between the two, which need not now be entered into. The transverse section of
a typical specimen is composed of a woody zone formed of a number of wedge-
shaped bundles, the spaces between these bundles and the centre being occupied by
the pith. There are two principal forms of variation from the normal type. One

of these has a structure not unlike that of the pine, and the pith is reduced to a

very small speck, containing only a few small cells. The other variety has a large
central cavity, which assumes various forms, and which are evidently due to the
original structure and not to irregularities in fossilization. In many of these no

pith is present ; in others only a small portion remains. It is very probable that the

absence of the pith in many cases is due to its destruction before or during fossili-
zation. In many of these specimens the wedge-shaped bundles are absent, and

the ligneous zone assumes a homogeneous structure. There is also a very great
variety in the vessels forming the bundles, often even in the same plant, which

gives to transverse sections a beautiful appearance.

   A Wcomplete stem is seld met with, the bark being generally absent, but in
                                                                                  ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  629

 several of my sections this peculiar structure is well shown. It consists of a large-
 celled paienclivma of very loose texture, and may be divided into an inner and

  outer hark. The inner portion is formed of three or more rows of hrick-like cells
  surrounding- the woody zone, while the outer epiderm is formed of one or two rows
  of very large cells having a thick outer wall, the whole structure being little
 better than an epidermal layer, and of a very perishable nature. The roots of these

  beautiful plants have not yet been described, but I have good reasons for believing

 that the specimens I am now about to describe belong to them.

       Professor Williamson has described two very singular plants from the Lanc.i-
 shire coal-field, under the generic name of Amyelon. One of these he has shown

  to be the root of Asterophyllites. This root appears to be rare in our Yorkshire

 coal-strata, but the other, A. radicans, is not unfrequently met with, I have lately
 found one or two new forms of these pithless roots, which appear to be closelj''
 allied to the latter species. One of these has a solid vascular cylinder consisting

 of radiating laminae, the outer vessels of which are the largest, the vessels

 gradually becoming smaller as they approach the centre. Laminse of small vessels

 and medullary rays intermingle at the circumference with laminse of large ones

 but as they converge towards the centre many of them coalesce with one another,

 so that even there the vessels do not become so small as they otherwise would do,
 and thus preserve an open network arrangement which gives the plant a very
 striking appearance. The bark, of which only a small portion is preserved, is

 almost identical in structure with that of Astromyelon.

      The other root has a much smaller central axis, but it presents a striking

 diiference, in the fact that its large-celled thick bark is nearly always present,

 I have many specimens of this root, and the majority have the bark fairly pre-
 served. The structure of its vascular cylinder more nearly resembles that of
 Amyelon radicans than that of the other does; but the vessels are, as a rule,
 much smaller, and they are barred in the radial sections, wliile those of

 A. radicans are i-eticulated. AVhile writing, both these plants are before me, and
 the difference in their vascular cylinders is most striking, especially in respect to
 the markings on the vessels, and also in respect to the beautiful state of preserva-

tion of the bark in my plant and its absence in the other. The bark is about as

 thick as half the diameter of the woody cylinder, and is composed of an inner layer
 of delicate mural parenchyma, and an outer epiderm of large cells, but of very
irregular size, the middle portion being a combination of the two forms. Some-
times the structure is composed of large cells of more uniform size.

     The next problem to solve is, to what plants do these roots belong ? As the
result of a very careful examination of a large series of specimens, I have come to
the conclusion that they are the roots of Astromyelon. It would extend this
abstract too far to go into the subject fully, but I may mention two or three

myof reasons for coming to this conclusion. In the first place, the large open cells

and vessels of these plants are exactly what one would expect to find in the root
of Astromyelon, just as we find the vessels of the vascular cylinder of Stigmaria
agreeing with those of the ligneous zone, in the Lepidodendra. The very younc
forms of Astromyelon largely partake of the character of these roots. In longi-
tudinal sections the vessels in both plants are identical. In the radial sections of
both, the vessels are seen to be barred. The structure of the bark is also identical
in both stem and root, and lastly I have invariably found the two associated in the
same material. Being uncertain whether these two roots are merely diff'erent
forms of one species, I propose to unite them provisionally under the name of
Amyelon radiaius.

Somerset. The subject-matter of tlie paper is a very concise description of the
areas and extension of tlie divisions ioto which the Devonian rocks are separable
upon stratigraphical grounds. The area treated of is embraced in sheets 20, 21,
2(3 and 27 of the Ordnance Maps. Of these, the Devonian rocks in sheets 20 and 21
had been mapped in detail by the author, whilst in the other sheets their relations
had been carefully ascertained. The paper is little more than an index to the
notes made by the author in prosecuting his researches in the stratigraphy of the
Devonian area.^

     The classification adopted is as follows :

The Foreland Grits occupy an area (superficial) of 30 sq. miles, extending

from Countesbury to Duuster. Thej' are faulted against the Lynton Beds, by a

great fault, which can be distinctly traced but where the latter are entirely cut
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

out by it near Luccott Hill, the faulted junction between the Foreland and

Iliingman Grits is very vague, owing to the imperfect nature of the surface

ovidence. At Oare, the Foreland Grits are overlain by Lynton Beds on the north

fiide of the fault.

The Lynton   Beds occupy an          area of  about  14 sq.  miles                         they do not appear to

the east of Luccott Hill; their junction with the Hangman grits is perfectly con-

formable, and near Trentishoe there is a very gradual passage.

    The Hangman Grits form the range which includes Dunkery Beacon, also the

whole northern part of the Quantocks. Their relations to the Ilfracombe Slates

are much complicated by faults around Croydon Hill and on the Quantocks and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the prevalence of grits in the Ilfracombe series, whilst indicative of lithological

assimilation, makes the boundarj' rather indefinite.

The Ilfracombe and Morte slates occupy a larger part of the Devonian area

than any other division. Their lithological characters vary when traced into the

Brendon and Quantock districts. Their junction with the Pickwell Down Beds is

seldom affected by faults, and in West Somerset usually presents a perfect litho-

logical passage through green and purple slates.

    The Pickwell Down Beds in North Devon form a perfectly defined conformable

jimction with the Baggy Beds, Indian-red being contrasted with green slates.
From North Molton to Wiveliscombe, the relations of the Upper Devonian beds
are much complicated by faults.

The Baggy Beds are well-marked between Baggy Point and Stoke Rivers, but

further east thej' are only locally distinguishable, owing to disturbances and the

Cuculloea and Lingula Beds are distinguishable, but near Wiveliscombe the fossils
have been found in reverse positions, the Cucullsea zone being under the Lingula

    The rilton Beds are the most fossiliferous beds in the Devonian Series ; their junc-
tion with the Culm-Measures appears to be a palnsontological one near Dulverton,

but the nature of the evidence along the junction is, as a rule, very unsatisfactory.
Faults prevail near Morebath, but from Clayhanger eastward' the junction appears
to be perfectly conformable, following a feature line.

9. The Bevono- Silurian Formation. By Professor E. Hull, LL.B., F.B.S.

     The beds which the author proposed to group under the above designation are
found at various parts of the British Isles, and to a slight extent on the Continent.
The formation is, however, eminently British, and occurs under various local
names, of which the following are the principal :

                                        England and Wales.

and the Upper Silurian Series).

hand, and the Devonian, on the other. He also submitted that their importance, as

indicated by their great development in Ireland and Scotland, entitled them to a

distinctive name, such as that proposed.

    10. On Evapm-atlon and Eccentricity as Co-factors in Glacial Periods.

                             By the Rev. E. Hill, M.A.

    As the temperature rises, the evaporation from water grows ; grows rapidly, and

Teith continually increasing rapidity. If at a steady temperature there be a steady
mamount of evaporation, then the result of fluctuations
                                                              temperature will be to

augment the amount of evaporation. Hence, if -with a steady heat-supply there
be a given amount of evaporation, fluctuations in that supply will in like manner aug-
ment that amount. Or it fluctuations already exist, an increase in their extent -will
still further augment the amount. But increased eccentricit)' can increase the difler-

ences in the rates of heat-supply; also evaporation is equal to precipitation. There-

fore under increased eccentricity the annual snowfall may be augmented without any
accompanying increase of annual melting. Thus an uncompensated annual surplus
of snow may be produced which will pccumulate. The possible increase for fluc-
tuations of a probable amount is calculated, and found to be appreciable and con-

siderable.

11. On the Discovery of Goal-Measures nnder Neiv Red Sandstone, and on the
    so-called Permian lioclis of St. Helen's, Lancashire} By A. Strahan,
     M.A., F.G.S., Geological Survey of England and Wales.

     The Trias has been penetrated, during the last few years, by three colliery
shafts and three boreholes in the district bordering the St. Helen's and Wigan coal-
fields on the south. It was thinner than might have been expected, while the
Permian formation was altogether absent. This latter formation was believed to

underlie the Trias, but to be overlapped, so as not to appear at the surface, except-
ing at St. Helen's Junction, where a marl-bed, and a soft sandstone beneath it, 30
and 90 feet thick respectively, and supposed by Messrs. Binney and Hull to be

Permian Marl and Lower Permian Sandstone, were found in a quarry and a well.
     The Bold Hall Colliery shaft, at about 1 mile from the outcrop of supposed

Permian rocks, proved the shale to maintain its thickness, but the sandstone to
be 57 feet inches only. The Coal-Measures were entered at 186 feet, and pene-
trated to a depth of 1,800 feet from the surface, when the Florida Mine was met
with. The red staining, due to the Trias, extended to a depth of 365 feet in the
Coal-Measures.

     The Collins Green Colliery shafts, at the same distance from the boundary of
the Trias, but three-quarters of a mile north-east of Bold Hall Colliery, proved
the shale to be 22 feet, and the sandstone 44 feet in thickness. The latter con-

tained spherical concretions of iron pyrites, binding the grains of sand in their

original position in the planes of bedding. The Coal-Measures were entered at
310 feet 10 inches, and penetrated to the Florida Mine, at 1,067 feet 7 inches
from surface. They were red for 152 feet. The dip of the so-called Permian was

to the south-east at C°, that of the Coal-Measures at 10°.

     The Ilaj'dock Colliery shafts (Lyme Pits), at the same distnnce from the
boundary of the Trias, are 1 mile north-east of Collins Green. The shale and
sandstone had diminished here to 9 feet and 7^ feet respectively. The Coal-

 Measures were penetrated to a depth of 97 feet 2 inches, or 413 feet 3 inches from
surface. In the shafts of this and the Collins Green Collier}', the unconformity
of the red sandstone and the Coal-Measures was clearly visible.

     The above sections show that the so-called Permian Marl and Sandstone thin
out gradually from west to east, the lower thinning out first, and not the upper,
as would have been the case if they had been unconformably overlapped by the
overlying beds. They thin out to the south also, as proved by a borehole near
Farnworth, 3 miles south of St. Helen's .lunction, which, after penetrating 124 feet
of yellow and white sandstone, passed through 3 feet of red and white clay, 3 feet
of red sandstone, and entered purple marls with bands of limestone, belonging to

the Coal-Measures.

     The so-called Permian Beds, though unconformable to the Coal-Measures, are

quite conformable to the Trias, and are overlapped in consequence of an attenua-
tion in themselves, and not through having suffered denudation before the Trias
was deposited upon them. Considering also their lithological similarity to the
Trias, it seems that they should be classed with this formation, rather than with
the Permian.

      The Permian Rocks are probably absent west ofWarrington, for two boreboles
at I'arkside and Winwick, commencing in the Pebble Beds, entered the Coal-
Measures at 291 and 341 feet respect ivel)', without encountering them. The Trias
contained a bed of shale about 30 feet tliick, and was based by soft sandstone with

twio-sliaped concretions of iron pyrites. Like tlie spherical nodules of Collins Green,

these probably owed their origin to th.e actioa of Coal-Measure water, with sul-

phides in solution, acting on the colouriug matter (peroxide of iron) of the Trias.

The Coal-Measures consisted of purple and green marls, and at Winwick were
associated with limestone. They, and the same beds found in the Farnworth
boring, are precisely similar to the well-known Whiston Limestone, and like it

contain the Microconchus carbunarius. These limestones are probably the equiva-
lents of the Ardwick Limestone series in the Upper Coal-Measures of Manchester,

and may be found to be underlain by representatives of the coal-seams which are
found in connection with it. AVithout doubt, they must be everywhere underlain
by the whole of the productive Middle Coal-Measures, but at a great and unknown

depth, though there is reason to believe that the thickness of barren measures

would be less in West Lancashire than near Manchester.

                            By E. B. Tawney, M.A., F.G.S.

     The descriptions of former writers having been cited, it was found that there
were two main views regarding the affinities of these sands, which occur in the
clift" between Long Mead End and Beacon Bunny. The view formulated by the
distinguished foreign geologists, D'Archiac, Dumont, Professor Hebert, and Pro-
fessor C. Mayer, is that they are parallel to the upper sands of the Beauchamp
( = Barton) period, and allied, therefore, to the marine Barton beds. This view is
much the same as that of E. Forbes, and the Geological Survey, who called them
the Upper Bagshot Sands,

      Latterly Professor Judd has sought to revive the term Ileadon-Hill-Sands for
them, presuming them to be most nearly connected with the Headon series, and
extending the bounds of that series to receive them.

     The author now gives a list of twenty-eight species obtained from the bed at
Long Mead End ; of these 35 per cent, are common to the sand and the Barton
beds, but do not occur in the Headon series ; while only 21-4 per cent, are common
tothe sand and Headon series, but do not occur in Barton beds. It is shown that

this sand belongs to the zone of Ceritkium pleiirotomo'ides, Lam., and is exactly
parallel to the sands of Mortefontaine, which belong to the same horizon, consti-
tuting the upper portion of the Beauchamp deposits. This is altogether below
the C. concancm zone.

     From_ these sands being intimately connected with the Barton beds in both
areas, it is held that the term Upper Bagshot is the most fitting designation that
has been proposed for them.

  3. On 'Flots.' By J. R. Dakyns, M.A., Geological Survey of England

                                               and Wales.

    The word 'flot' is a miner's term for ore lyinp' between the beds, or at certain

definite horizons in the strata. In textbooks flots are p:enerally called 'flats'

or ' flattings.' The}^ are of two kinds: (1) those connected with 'cross-veins';
(2) those connected witli courses of dun limestone. Firstly, cross-veins are
veins (generally mere spar veins on Greenhow Hill) Avhich cross and intersect
or shift the metal veins, but which often bear ore at their intersection with

the metal veins. Where these cross-veins cut the flot-planes, ore is found.
Secondly, similarly with courses of dun limestone. Dun limestone, so-called from
its colour, is a dnlomitized form of ordinary limestone. The dun lime occurs in
beds or irregular masses, or more frequently iu dyke-like courses, running N.N.W.

and S.S.E. These courses are often several yards or even fathoms wide, and
where the dun course crosses the flot-plaue ore is developed along the joints
between the dun and the white limestones.

      Ore is not found along the flot-plane except at its intersection with the cross-
veins or with the courses of dun limestone.

       4. RemarJcs uj^on the Strudin'e and Classification of the Blastoidea.

                           By P. Hekbekt Caepentee, M.A.

     The author and Jlr. R. Etheridge, jim., who are preparing a joint Memoir

upon the Blastoidea, have arrived at the following conclusions respecting the

group.
      It is very doubtful whether the genus rentremites occurs at all in Britain.

Some badly preserved fragments from the Devonian and the Scotch Carboniferous
are possibly referable to it ; but most of the Blastoids (besides Cadaster) which

occur in the Carboniferous Limestone belong to the genus Granatocrintts, Troost.,
 which is represented by some seven or eight species.

     Cumberland's 3Iitra eUiptica is the representative of a new genus, distin-

 guished by the eccentric position of the spiracles. Codastcr is a true Blastoid, and
 not a Cystid, as supposed by Billings, Tlie slit-like openings of its hydrospires are
 nearly on the same level as the ambulacra, which do not conceal them at all. In
 the ordinary Blastoids, however, they are below and concealed by the ambulacra,
 opening externally by pores at the sides of the latter. There are various interme-
 diate forms between these two extremes, in which the hydrospiral slits are more
 or less concealed by the ambulacra, but are partially visible at their sides. It is
 proposed to group the species thus distinguished into a genus Fentremitidea, which
 is represented in Britain by the little Pentrcmitcs acutus, Sowerby, in Belgium by

 P. caryopJiyllatus, and in Spain by P. PAilleti, De Verneuil, for which last the
 uame PentrcmHidva had been already proposed by D'Orbigny. An arrangement
 of this kind has been already suggested by I3illings.

      The discoveries of Eofe, Wachsmuth, and Ilambach, respecting the perforation
 of the lancet-piece by a longitudinal canal, are confirmed. This canal probably
 lodged the water-vessel, which must have been devoid of any tentacular extensions,
 as in some Ilolothurians, and in the arms of certain Cornatidce. Respiration was
 effected, however, by means of the hydrospires. The pores usually found at the
  sides of the ambulacra were not the sockets for the attachment of the appendages,
 but led downwards into the hydrospires, serving to introduce water, which made
 its way out through the spiracles. The genital ducts probably opened into some

  portion of the hydrospires, as they do into the closely similar structures of the
  Ophiuroidea, and the ova were discharged through the spiracles. Billings'

 statements are confirmed respecting the existence in many species of a single or
  possibly double row of jointed appendages along each side of the ambulacra; but

  these appendages are not homologous with the pinnules of the Crinoidea.
       In perfect specimens the peristome is covered in by a vault of small polygonal

  plates, any definite arrangement of which is rarely traceable. Extensions of this
                                                                            ·

vault were continued down the sides of the ambulacral grooves, which could thua

be closed in completely and converted into tunnels, as in recent Crinoids.
     The classification of the Blastoidea must depend entirely upon morphological

principles. Mere differences in the relative sizes of the calyx plates are of very
little systematic value; and difierences in the numbers of side plates on given

lengths of the ambulacra are absolutely worthless. On the other hand, the

structure and relative positions of the hydrospires and spiracles are morphological

characters of much svstematic value.

5. On the Characters of the ' Lansdown Encrimfe' (Millencrinus Prattii,
                  Gray, sp.) Sij P. Herbekt Caepenter, M.A.

The 'Lansdown Encrinite ' is a species of MiUericrimis (M. Prattii, Gray, sp. =

Apiocrinns ohconicits, Goldfuss) from the Great Oolite on the top of Lansdown, near

Bath. It is remarkable for the very great variation in the characters of its stem

and calyx. The former may reach 50 mm. in length, and consist of 70 discoidal

joints; or there may be less than 10 joints, the lowest of which is rounded off

below, and its central canal closed up. Various intermediate conditions may occur

between these two extremes, while in some specimens there may be only 2 to 4

stem-joints                                                        and  in  one  case  the whole  stem is represented by a slightlv convex

imperforate plate on which the basals rest. This specimen, taken by itself, would

be naturally regarded as a Comatula of advanced age, in which the cirrhus-sockets

had disappeared from the centro-dorsal just as they do in the recent Actino7netra
Juki'sii. The general appearance of the calyx is very similar to that of Pentacrinus

Wynllc-TJiomsoni ivnm the North Atlantic. But it is remarkable for the number
of small intercalated pieces which it may contain. The basals are frequently

separated from one another, or from the radials, by minute plates which, while

regularly developed all round the calyx in some specimens, are entirely absent in

others.

     Tlie nearest allies of J/. Prattn seem to be M. Munsferianus, var. Buchianus,
and M. Kodotianus. It stands on the extreme limit of the genus, connecting it
with Pentacrinus on the one hand, and with the free Comatulidce on the other.

It is thus a synthetic type, as would naturally be expected from its geological
position ; for it is probably the earliest known species of the genus, except
perhaps for two doubtful Liassic forms, which are known only by isolated plates
and stem-joints.

6. On the Lov;er Keuper Sandstone of CJicshire. Bij A. Stkahan, M.A., '
               F.G.8., Geological Survey of England and Wales.

     This paper deals with some of the results of the re-survey of parts of Cheshire,
which have been already described in detail in the Geological Survey Memoirs
'On the Neighbourhood of Prescot' (.3rd edition), and 'On the Neighbourhood

of Chester.' Several sections, of which the best are at Euncorn and Frodsham,
show that there is a strong and constant division between the Waterstones and
the Keuper Basement Beds. These were formerly classed together under the
name of Lower Keuper Sandstone, but, so far as the re-survey has been carried,

--are now distinguished on the maps. The old and new classifications may be

compared as follows :

Lower Keuper Sandstone . . , Lower Keuper Sandstone or
                                        I Basement Beds

     The Basement Beds, which form bold escarpments, consist of courses of hard
building-stone with partings of soft sand, and a considerable thickness of soft
current-bedded sand at top, distinguished by the name of the Frodsham Beds.
636 hkport-- 1881.

The courses of building stone are conglomeratic, and rest on eroded surfaces. The
Frodshani Beds are precisely similar to the soft upper and lower subdivisions of

the Bunter.

     The Waterstones, on the other hand, are allied to the Marls in ever)' respect,
even the sandstone-beds being easily distinguishable from those of the Basement
Beds, The striking contrast between the Waterstones and the Basement Beds is
well shown at Runcorn and Frodsham, where deep-red shales rest direct upon the
current-bedded sands of the Frodsham Beds. Upwards the Waterstones pass
quite insensibly into the Red Marls, and like them, coutaiu ripple-marks, sun-
cracks, so called rain-pittings, and the casts of rock-salt crystals. The last-named

appear first in the "Waterstones.

     The Waterstones, like the other subdivisions of the Trias, varv rapidlv in
colour. They are generally red, but near Kelsall are white, with green shales.
The Basement Beds at Helsby are brown, but at Manlev are white ; at Delamere
brown again, but once more white in the Peckforton Hills. The Frodsham Bed.s
change from red to white in a few 3'ards in the railway cutting at Runcorn, and
again near Frodshani and Overton. The Upper Mottled Sandstone goes through

every possible variation between red, white, and yellow, at Beeston Castle. These
changes show that no dependence can be placed on colour as a means of

identification.

     In Lancashire, previously surveyed by Mr. De Ranee, the base of the Marls
had been drawn at this line below the Waterstones, no subdivision of the Water-
stones from_ the Marls being possible, owing to Drift. The section in the Orrell
railway is similar to that at Runcorn, and the Basement Beds here and at Ormskirk
are of the same character as in Cheshire. In Liverpool the same sequence has
been made out by Messrs. De Ranee and Morton.

     Near Nottingham the same line has been observed by Mr. Aveline (· Geol.
Survey Memoir,' 2nd edition). Though the Basement Beds are thin, and in places
absent, the Waterstones are well-developed. Mr. Shipman (' Nottingham Nat. Soc.
Ann. Rep.' 1880) remarks on this overlap, and states that there is an appearance of
erosion between the Waterstones and the Basement Beds. The same observer
mentions the marked contrast presented by the Waterstones to the Basement Beds
at Alton in Staffordshire.

     The line therefore is persistent over a large area. The notion that there was
a perfect passage from the Basement Beds into the Marls arose from incorrect
mapping, by which the Waterstones were placed sometimes in the one, sometimes
in the other subdivision. At this horizon also the principal overlap in the Trias
takes place, for the Basement Beds thin out with the Bunter, but the Waterstones
and marls run on beyond so as to rest on Palisozoic Rocks. The change in the
character of the sediment, and the appearance of salt-crystals, show that at this
period a change in the physical geogi-aphy of the region took place, which led
to tranquil deposition of sediment and the concentration of brine in land-locked

basins.

     This line at the base of the Waterstones was taken by Ormerod and others as
the base of the Keuper, but in 1852 Prof. Hull drew the base below what then
came to be called the Keuper Basement Beds, because, firstly, there was no sign of a
break from this rock upwards; secondly, there was an apparent unconformity below
it. It has been shown that the first of these reasons will probably not hold good.
The second reason depends on evidence of unconformity which is not trustworthy.
The apparent unconformity visible at Ormskirk (' Triassic Memoir,' p. 87) is an
effect of current-bedding, and the evidence of denudation of the Bunter in South
Lancashire and Cheshire rests on the identification of horizons in the Upper
Mottled Sandstone by colour, which is now known to be untrustworthy. The
appearances of erosion below the Basement Beds are equally strong at other
horizons, for instance below the Pebble Beds in the middle of the Bunter.

     Considering the strong lithological resemblance of the Basement Beds with the
Bunter, and the similarity of its distribution, it must be reconsidered whether the
importance of the line between them has not been over-estimated, and whether
the line at the base of the Waterstones does not constitute a more important

cstraiiij:rapliical horizon in the Trias. It is proposed to distinguish in future the

Waterstones from the Lower Keuper Sandstone, reserving the latter name for the

sandstones and conglomerates, as typically developed in Cheshire.

7. Oil a Discovery of Fossil Fishes in the Neio Bed Sandstone of Nottingham.
                                  By E. WiLSOX, F.G.8.

     The author called the attention of the Section to a recent discovery of fossil

--iishes in the Lower Keuper Sandstone of England a circumstance of sufficient

rarity in itself, apart from any palfeontological results, to deserve at least a
passing notice.

     During the construction of the Leen Valley Outfall Sewer in 187S, a remark-
ably interesting section was given by the tunnelling driven through Kough Hill,
ur Colwick Wood, near Nottingham, showing the lower beds of the Waterstones
resting on a denuded surface of the * Basement Beds ' of the Keuper.

     The lowest stratum of the Waterstones was a sandstone about a foot thick,
with streaks of red and green marl, and a seam of pebbles at the base. The fishes
occurred in this bed, and chiefly in a thin seam of red marl, overlying the pebbly
seam at the very bottom of the Waterstones ; they were present in large numbers,
as if in a shoal, for a distance, in the line of section, of about .33 feet.

     The specimens he obtained have been examined by several competent authorities,
but unfortunately their state of preservation is so bad that nothing certain can be
made out as to their precise zoological aflinities. Dr. Traquair, however, believes
that they probably belong to some species, new or old, of the genus 6'emionotns.

   --The occurrence of these fossils at the junction of two distinct sets of beds--

the Basement Beds and the Waterstones is probably not a mere chance coincidence.

--The characters of the preceding Keuper Basement Beds false-bedded, coarse, grey

sandstones and conglomerates with large fractured quartzite pebbles, and lenticular

--beds of red marl prove them to. have been formed during a period of great
--violence ; while those of the Waterstones regularly-bedded fine-grained yellowish

--sandstones and red marls covered with ripple-marks, sun-cracks, and pseudomorphs

of common salt show that they were formed in quiet and shallow waters. It

appears pretty certain, then, that these fishes did not live in this area during the

turbulent times of the Basement Beds, but came in when subsidence let in the

quieter waters of the Waterstone epoch.*

        8. On the Rhostics of Nottinghamshire. By E. Wilson, F.G.S.

     The author gave a summarised account of the Khsetic series in Nottingham-
shire. The Ehfetic sections of this district already known to geologists comprise
those at Gainsboro', Newark, and Elton. The author described several additional

--new sections in the Rhfetics of the county viz., at Gotham and Kilvino-ton

between Newark and Bottesford; at Barnstone, between Bingham and Stathern;

the boring for coal at Owthorpe, near Colston Bassett ; and the section at Stanton-

on-the-Wolds, between Nottingham and Melton Mowbray. A list of the Rha^tic

fossils of Notts was given, and the presence of bone-beds noticed. The author
could not agree with certain geologists that the green marls which are found

beneath the Paper Shales in Notts (nor probably also the ' Tea-green Marls ' of the

West of England) belong to the Ilhjetic series, but took them to be Upper Keuper
Marls, once red in colour, which had become discoloured by the downward infil-

tration of some deoxidising agents evolved during the decomposition of the organic
matters of the fossils of the Paper Shales. For, in lithological character the

     ' It should be mentioned that the specimens were obtained under somewhat un-
favourable circumstances, namely in the roof of a tuimel, several hundred feet from
daylight, and after the rock liad been defaced by smoke and dirt. The fossiliferous
bed lies only a few feet below the surface of the ground, and if carefully opened
from abo\e better and perhaps identifiable specimens might very possibly be obtained.

green marls agreed with underlying beds in tlie Keuper, but differed markedly
from the overlying Rhfetics ; then there was every appearance of a passage be-
tween the green marls and the underlying red and green marls of the Keuper; and,
lastly, the green marls, like the rest of the Keuper marls, were practically unfos-

siliferous, while with the commencement of the Paper Shales we get the remains

of an abundant, and distinctly marine fauna, in part Liassic.

9. The Great Flain of Northern India not an old Sea-hasin.

          Bij W. T. Blanfoed, F.B.8., F.G.S., &c.

The author called attention to the distribution of land in the Indian peninsula,

and to the intervention of a vast plain, traversed by the Indus, Ganges, and

Brahmaputra, between the Himalayas and other hill ranges to the east, west,

and north, and the more or less hilly tracts forming the peninsula itself. The

plain varies in breadth from rather less than 100 to nearly 300 miles.

This plain has constantly been considered, both by geological and biological

writers, as the basin of a great sea, that, in Tertiary times, and probably earlier,

separated the Himalayan area from the land of the peninsula. Even in some

geological descriptions by an officer of the Geological Survey of India ('Itec.

G.S.I.' iii. p. 17) the older alluvial deposits of Bengal are classed as marine or

estuarine.

On examining the evidence, however, there does not appear to be a single fact

in favour of the sea having at any geological period occupied the Gangetic or

eastern portion of the plain. On the eastern coast of India, near the shores of the

Bay of Bengal, marine Jurassic strata are intercalated with certain beds containing

land plants (Upper Gondwana) in several localities, and the same marine and

similar plant'bearing beds are associated in Kattiawar to the westward. But in

the only place on the edge of the Gauges plain Avhere the plant-bearing beds are
found, no marine fossils are met with. Some older beds of very low meaozoic or

very high palreozoic age (Damuda) are found both north and south of the plain,

and as they are river deposits, they may perhaps indicate that the intervening

country was land when they were formed. At any rate no marine strata

Aaccompany them.  great thickness of nearly horizontal basaltic traps in the

Khasi hills, east of the Gangetic plain, appears to bo a continuation of the well-

known Tlajmahal traps, believed to be of Jurassic age, and if so, these volcanic

rocks, which are undoubtedly of subaerial origin, must have extended across the

plain north of Calcutta.

Again, marine cretaceous beds are found on the shores of the Bay of Bengal in

two localities at least, and again in the Khasi hills to the eastward, showing that

in all probability the coast line extended from one to the other, but no trace of

such beds is known to occur on the edges of the Ganges plain.

Eocene (nummulitic) rocks of marine origin occur throughout the western

margin of the Indus basin in Sind and the Punjab, and extend across the north of

the latter to- the spot where the Jumna leaves the Himalayas; east of this they are
only found in one locality in Kumaon. Thence for 1.3 degrees of longitude not a

trace has been discovered, nor do they recur until the Guro hills are reached. To

the east of the Indus plain also nummulitic limestone occurs, but none is found
along the southern side of the Ganges plain. Marine, oligocene, and miocene beds

are met with as far north as the frontier between Sind and the Punjab, but have

not yet been traced further north with certainty. Marine pliocene beds are only

met with near the coast.

The distribution of marine Tertiary rocks therefore indicates that in Eocene

times the sea occupied the whole Indus valley as far as the Himalayas, and an

arm must have extended to the region now drained by the Upper Indus in Tibet,

as nummulites have been foxmd there; but there is no evidence of any sea having

occupied the Gangetic or eastern portion of the plain. It is scarcely probable, if a

nummulitic sea occurred throughout the whole Indo-Gangetic plain, that a fringe of

nummulitic deposits, continuous over many hujidreds of miles, should surround
                                   ;

TRANSACTIONS OIT, SECTION C.  639

the western half, whilst not a trnce has heen found around the eastern half, except

far to the eastward. In later Tertiary times the sea that ocfcupied the Indus
valley appears to have greatly decreased, and still further diminution of the

marine area took place during the Pliocene epoch. As several species of land
mammalia in the Pliocene Siwaliks are also found in' Guzerat, it is manifest that
land commimication must have existed between the two areas.

     All that is known of the Post-pliocene and recent deposits in the Indo-Gangetic
plain leads to the same conclusion ; no marine bed has yet been detected in them.
Only a few borings have been made : but in one to a depth of 701 feet, at Ura-
bala ; in another 431 feet deep, at Bhiwani in Hissar (Punjab), and in a third 574
feet deep, at Sabzallsot in the Derajat, west of the Indus, no marine remains were
discovered, and the beds traversed appeared to be all river-deposits. Still more ex-
traordinary is the circumstance that the boring made at FortWilliam in Calcutta,

to a depth of 481 feet below the surface, or 400 below the sea-level, passed through

not a single undoubted marine deposit, whilst peat, freshwater shells, and mamma-

lian bones were found, some of them at almost the greatest depths reached.
     The whole of the negative evidence, and some direct evidence, is, therefore,

opposed to the idea of the Gangetic plain having ever been occupied by the sea.
The tract is evidently an area of depression filled up to above the sea-level, in all
probability, throughout a long geological range of time, by the detritus from the
surrounding mountains, and to a smaller extent from the hill tracts to the south-

ward.

10. Tlie Gold Fields, and the Quartz-outcrops of Soutliern India. By

     William King, Deputy Superintendent (for Madras), Oeological Survey

      of India.

     This paper was a resume of the knowledge ascertained through the author's
original survey of the Wainad gold field in 1874, and by the later surveys and
examinations of others : also in his examination of the Travancore and other areas

in the beginning of this year.

    The geographical distribution of the gold areas is briefly treated of as being
at Mangapet, on the Godavari river, near Dumhal, in the South Mahratta country,

near Kolar, in Mysore, at Salem, in part of the Travancore State, and in the Nil-
giri and Malabar country; and these are then reduced to the more important

fields of Malabar (including Wainad and the Nilgiris) and Mysore.
     Next follows a description of the rocks (Gneissic Series) of these two areas

and the extent, mode of occurrence, and constitution of the quartz-reefs traversino-
them. These gneisses are striking, in Mysore, northwards and southwards, and in
Malabar north-east and south-west; while the reefs in both cases are runnino-

north-north-west to south-south-east, or thereabout, and are considered by the
author to occupy the widened-out fissures of meridional jointing".

     The reefs of Wainad are developed to a remarkable extent over a very large

area of country ; but their auriferousness is only displayed over a portion of this

(mainly in south-east Wainad and in the adjacent low-country of Malabar), in a

generally east-and-west belt, the reefs outside of this being fewer and only very
locally auriferous. The leaders or offshoots of the reefs in this belt are strongly
and numerously developed ; and they and the 'casing' are rich in gold. It is
these adjuncts of the reefs, and not the reefs themselves, which have been so ex-

tensively worked by the ancient miners. On the other hand, the reefs, as far as is
known, do not as yet show any continued steadiness in their auriferousness, but
may be said to be capriciously permeated with the precious metal. The gold of

the reefs is pale-coloured and of about the ' touch' of standard gold; that of the
'leaders' and 'casing' is yellow gold and of superior quality.

     The apparent distribution of the gold in a generally east-and-west belt over a
country whose rocks are striking north-east and' south-west, and the quartz-reefs of
which are running north-north-west to south-south-east, and far beyond the limits

 of this belt, leads the author to speculate on a possible deposition of the gold
 subsequent to the formation of the reefs.
                                                                    --

640                                REPORT 1881.

The peculiar quartz-outcrops of Travancore, supposed by many to be auriferous

reefs, are next described, the author having, in his late examination of them fo]-

the Government of that State, been obliged to look on these as really beds ot

quartz-rock, or felspathic quartz-rock, associated and contemporaneous with the

Agneisses.  mere trace of gold has been found in a small sample of this rock ; but

none was found by ordinary hand-crushing and working. Neither are there any

traces of old gold- workings in the area marked by these outcrops.

Lastly, the economic aspect of the "Wainad field is considered. Mr. King does

not see any good reason, on the total results obtained, to think that the average

out-turn of gold will ever be appreciably more than that argued for from his original

assays, namely, seven pennyweights to the ton. He also does not think that a

paying return "can be obtained on less than three pennyweights to the ton. Though

very hopeful of the moderate and paying quality of the reefs, he is decidedly of

opinion that the results obtained so far do not warrant the wild expectations

which have been prevalent in England and India during the last twelve months ;
nor do they justify the enormous prices which have been paid for lands and con-

cessions. "Beyond the ultimate profitable working looked for by the author, there

must be considerable delay (even for nine months more at least) before retarding

--conditions such as the settlement of land tenure and mining rights, the obtaining
--of labour, and the getting of the machinery on the ground can be overcome.

11. 0)1, the Geology of the Island of Cyprus. Si/ R. Russell, G.E.

     The physical features of the Island of Cyprus are tsvo great mountain-chains,
the axes of which are mainly parallel to each other. These two ranges are as

distinct from each other in physical appearance as in geological structure. The
southern or Troiidos mountains are rounded in outline, and culminate in Mount
Troiidos, G,340 feet above the sea-level. The northern, or Kerynia, mountain-chain
rises up from the hummocky ground on both sides, as it were, in one great conti-

nuous wall-like cliff, its vertical crags and turret-like peaks projecting upwards to

heights of more than 3,000 feet. The hummocky ground at the base of the pre-

cipitous cliffs has a most peculiar aspect. "When looked at from above it resembles
a bird's-eye view of Alpine scenery ; when seen from the central valley it appears
as if the" whole area was covered with an immense number of small volcanic

cones.

    The central valley is flat when compared with the mountainous regions, but it

is exceedingly irregular and broken. Flat-topped ridges and hills, and conical
mounds, form a distinctive feature of this part of the island. The flat-topped hills
rise quite abruptly from the low ground, and therefore show more prominently

than they would otherwise do.

    The rocks which occur in Cyprus may be classified as follows :

                                                                Blown Sand

                  Igxeotjs Rocks

    The oldest stratified rock is doubtless the Mount Hilarion Limestone. This is

a verv hard, compact, crystalline limestone, generally of a dark blue colour. It is
very difficult to distinguish between the bedding and jointing in this rock, and
                                   TUAXSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  641

therefore equally difficult to detenuiue the direction of the dip. Certainly the
limestone is inclined at a high angle, and the general direction of the dip appears
to be towards the north.

     Above the compact limestone is a band of -white schistoze limestone. This
rock is fissile and joint V, splitting up into small fragments. It lies between the
base of the Konnos, and the Mount Hilarion limestone.

     'Konnos' is the term applied by the Cypriots to the rocks which occupy the

country flanking the limestone crags. It is' pronounced Kornos. The local name
is adopted, as it means chalky-like, and therefore convej's some idea of the calca-
reous nature of the beds to which the term is applied.

    The base of the ' Konnos ' is a breccia composed of large angular fragments of
limestone, this passes up into a conglomerate, and this again into beds of cal-

careous grey shales, with calcareous sandy bands, or beds of calcareous sandstone.
The sandy bands are generally from a few inches up to two feet thick, but

are very regular and continuous. The soft character of these rocks renders the
·work of subaerial denudation easy. The water, from the springs, and from the

periodical rains, has cut deep and narrow gorges through the konnos, leaving-

sharp ridges between the ravines. It is the intersection of these ridges with each
other which give to the districts which they occupy the appearance of a o-reat
series of small conical mounds.

    On the north side of the range the dip is generally to the north. On the south

side the inclination is also northwards for some distance, southwards from the
central ridge, but afterwards the beds lie in a series of rolls, the axes of which are
more or less parallel to the central axis of the mountain-chain. There are another

set of undulations at right angles to the strike cf the strata. Here then we have

evidence that ' konnos ' has been subjected to pre.ssure, acting at right angles and
to pressure acting parallel, to the axis of greatest upheaval.

     At the base of the Idalian beds on the tlanks of the Troodos, there occasionally
occurs a thin band of brown shale, in which are large concretionary lumps of dark-

coloured chert.

     This is followed by the white chalky rocks of the hills of Idalia, hence the
name Idalian Beds. In general tlie Idalian Beds consist of thin-bedded white

chalky-like Hags much jointed. The layers are from one inch to one foot thick,

but occasionally some of the bands are three or four feet in thickness.

     Amongst these rocks are found irregular deposits of s'ypsum. The gypsum
occurs as selenite in a matrix of gypsum, and as gypseous flags. The flags split up

into thin layers and yield excellent pavement.

     Near the base, the Idalian Beds contain bands of grey chert, and, in proximity
to the volcanic rock, the white rocks assume a pinkish colour.

    Any fossils which have been obtained from this series of rocks are of Miocene

age, but still are scarcely sufficient to determine satisfactorily the exact age of the
strata in which they are contained.

In the valleys of the rivers Morphu and Pidias, the Idalian Beds pass up into

the shales and sands which I have named the Nicosia Beds.

The Nicosia Beds are well-developed in the central valley, and consist of blue cal-

careous clays, brown sandy shales, bands of calcareous sandstone, and conglome-

rates. The fossils are very abundant and mostly belonging to the Pliocene period.
     Some of the calcareous sandstone bands very closely resemble the Kerynia

Ilock                         but  the real equivalent of  this rock is the yellow calcareous sandstone cap-
                           ;

ping the hills in the neighbourhood of Nicosia and Athienu. At Kerynia, the

lower beds do not exist, and the Kerynia Bock rests unconforniably on the ' Kon-

nos.' This rock is a yellow calcareous sandstone, or shelly limestone. It is here

generally termed a sandstone, because in general appearance and formation it
more resembles sandstone than limestone. It is from the Kerynia liock that the

building stone used in the island is chiefly obtained.

     Deposits of calcareous tuff and traventine occur on the flanks of the mountains.
In most cases the character of these beds is easily recognisable, but in some in-
stances they scarcely differ from compact limestone.

Old river-gravels cover a considerable area on the south side of the central vallev

 When cemented hy the infiltration of CaOj they are scarcely distinp;uishal)le from

  some of the older conglomerates.
      Raised beaches exist, between La Scala and Voroldini, between Famagousta and

 Varoschia, and on the northern coast near the mouth of the river Panagra. The
 shells found are, for the most part, species now living in the Mediterranean.

      Parts of thf surface of the island are covered with a hard encrustation, known
 by the name of ' kavara.' The formation of this surface rock is caused by the
 le-deposition of calcareous matter amongst the gravels, loams, decomposed shales,

  and other rocks forming the surface soils.
      Blown sands occur on the raised beaches near Famagousta, on the northern

 coast, and in the valley of the river Angelos, between Myrtu and Morphu,
      The alluvia] deposits consist of sand, gravel, and sandy loams and clays, form-

 ing rich and fertile land.

      From the character of the rocks now described there is no difficulty in as-
 signin"' the formation of the Nicosia Beds to Pliocene times. The Miocene age
 of the Idalian Beds is somewhat more doubtful. Below this all is uncertainty.
 Hitherto neither the ' Konnos,' nor the Mount Ililarion Limestone, has yielded
 any fossils. What length of time elapsed between the formation of the compact

 limestone and the ' Konno=,' or between the ' Konnos ' and the Kerynia Rock, it is

  impossible to estimate. Failing palfeontological evidence it is impossible to say

 what formations may be wanting. Lithological characteristics are not implicitly

 to be depended on, but it is better to give them due consideration thfin to assume
 a regular succession of formations, as Gaudry has done. Starting from the well-
 defined horizon of the Nicosia Beds, he classifies the Idalian Beds as Miocene,
 the 'Konnos' as Eocene, and the Mount Hilarion Limestone as Cretaceous, thus
 establishing a regular succession in the series. The ' Konnos ' has much litho-
 loo-ical resemblance to the Vienna Sandstone, and the compact limestone to many
 of the Jurassic limestones. This classification has been adopted by Unger and
 Kotschy, and has at least some evidence in its favour.

      The trachyte on which the Idalian Beds rest, on the flanks of the Troodos,
 appears to be the same rock as occurs at Mavro Vouni, and as appears at different
 places in the Kerynia range. It is a red, grey, and greenish vesicular and amyg-
 daloidal trap, traversed by an immense number of joints, filled with calcareous

  matter, so that the surface of the rock has the appearance of the irregular pave-

 ment seen in the streets of ancient Roman towns. The lower portion of this

 trachyte contains beds, veins, or dykes of traps, which stand up above the weathered
 surface like walls. Below this are found regularly bedded lavas, which surround
 the serpentines constituting the centre of the Troodos mountain-chain.

       These volcanic rocks, for the most part, have been formed prior to the for-
 mation of any of the stratified rocks. The invariable occurrence of the amorphous

 trachyte at so many places on both sides of the central valley, seems to point to

 its extension under the Tertiary rocks occupying the central portion of the island.

 There is some metamorphism observable among the stratified rocks near their
 junction with the trap. This is due to some later action than the formation of the
 trachyte, as the Idalian Beds rest on its denuded surAice, and outliers of these
 beds exist at many different places on the flanks of the southern range. The
 metamorphism is seen in the brown laminated shales with dark chert, in the pink-

 tinted beds, and in the schistose limestone, and probably dates from the great

 elevation of the land which took place at the end of Tertiary times. At this
period the land was raised, at least, from 1,800 to 2,000 feet.

      Since then an elevation of less extent has occurred. This last upheaval is of
comparatively recent date, and not more than 15 or 20 feet in vertical height.

12. Ohservaiions on the two types of Camlrian hods of the British Isles (the
      Caledoniali and Hiherno-Camhrimi), and the conditions under which they

    were respecHvely deposited. By Professor Edwaed Hull, LL.V.,F.B.S.

     In this paper the author pointed out the distinctions in mineral character
between the Cambrian beds of the North-West Highlands of Scotland, and their
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  643

assumed representatives in the East of Ireland, Wales, and Shropshire. In the
former case, which included the beds belonging to the ' Caledonian type,' the for-
mation consists of red or purple sandstones and conglomerates ; in the latter, -which
included the beds belonging to the 'Hiborno-Cambrian type,' the formation con-
sists of hard green and purple grits and slates, contrasting strongly with the
former in structure and appearance.

      These differences, the author considered, were due to deposition in distinct
basins, lying on either side of an archosan ridge of crystalline rocks, which ranged
probably from^ Scandinavia through the central Highlands of Scotland, and in-

cluded the North and West of Ireland, with the counties of Donegal, Derry,
Mayo, Sligo, and Galway, in all of which the Cambrian beds were absent, so that
the Lower Silurian repose directly and unconformably on the crystalline rocks of
Laurentian age, as shown in a previous paper.

     As additional evidence of the existence of this old ridge, the author showed
that when the Lower Silurian beds were in course of formation, the archsean floor
along the West of Scotland must have sloped upwards towards the east, but he

agreed with Professor E,amsay, that the crj^stalline rocks of the Outer Hebrides
formed the western limit of the Cambrian area of deposition, and that the basin
was in the form of an inland lake.

     On the other hand, looking at the fossil evidence both of the Irish and Welsh

Cambrian beds, he was of opinion that the beds of this basin were in the main, if

not altogether, of marine origin, and that the basin itself had a greatly wider
range eastward and southward, the old archtean ridge of the British Isles forming

but a small portion of the original margin.

     The Cambrian beds above referred to consist of the Llanberis, Harlech, and
Longmynd series, with their representatives at St. David's, in which Dr. Hicks
has discovered a primaeval marine fauna.

                       1.3. On the Lower Camhrian of Anglesea.
                   By Professor T. McK. Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.

      In this paper the author gives the results of further examination of the base-

ment beds of the Cambrian, which he has now traced all along the N.W. flank of

the Archasan axis of Llanfaelog.

     He found it resting in some places on gneissic rocks, varying from massive

granitoid to fine foliated schistose gneiss, and in other places the Cambrian was

seen lying on greenish or blue schist, probably, he thought, the equivalent of part
of the Bangor beds.

     But whatever it had below it there was such a similarity in the character of
the basement-beds that he had no difficulty in following it and mapping it. The
sequence which he found almost invariable was in ascending order.

           (A) Quartz conglomerate passing up into

           (,B) Grit, which in turn became finer and passed into

           (C) Sandstones, weathering brown, which got split up in their upper part
              by thin slabbj- shales (C2). These were succeeded by

           (D) Black shales with subordinate beds of black breccia (D2), and occasion-
                ally sandstones in the lower part.

     The conglomerate at the base was sometimes very thin, being only a foot or so
in one section mentioned. In this case the base of the Cambrian was a kind of
gneiss-arkose, which was seen resting on true gneiss, and in the grit and conglome-
rate, within twenty feet of the base, he had found abundant specimens of Orthis
Carausii. In another section, a few miles off, in the grits within about fifty feet of

--the base, he had found annelids and fucoids while in a third case, close by, the

basement conglomerate was split into two parts by a bed of black shale some
twenty feet thick.

     The brown sandstones and the black breccias had also yielded 0. Carausii and
a few other fossils.

     The petrological characters of the basement-beds were generally very constant,
though small variations accompanied the dift'erences in tlic underlying rocks. For

                                                                   TT 2

instance, where they rested on the chloritic schists, ·which -were seen under the
microscope to consist of a fine i'elspathic mud, nut only did frag-ments of this rock

occur in the conglomerate, but much of its material was found finely comminuted
in the matrix of the overlying series. Occasionally some way up in the basement-

beds, bands of large felsite pebbles were found, showing the drifting of the shingle

now and then from the more distant rocks of the felsitic series or Uinorwig Beds.
On the whole he considered that it was quite clear that the quartz-jasper con-

glomerates and the felsite conglomerates belonged to the same series, and formed

part of the basement-beds of the Cambrian.

   14. On the Gnarled Serlett of Aiuhcch and Hohjlieod. in Anrjlesea.
                   Bij Professor T. McK. Hughes, M.A., F.G.8.

     The author oflers the results of his inquiries into the age of certain schists
which form the main mass of the rocks of Northern and Western Anglesea,
leaving for the present the consideration of two masses of somewhat similar rock
which occur S. of the Llaufaelog gneissic axis in the central and south-eastern part

of the island.

     The two views hitherto current as fo their position were:
     1. The metamorphic theory of Professor Ramsaj', who referred them to
altered Cambrian and Silurian.
     2. The view of Dr. Ilicks and others, who considered them to be the upper

part of the Archasan rocks.

     The author offers a third explanation, which he calls at present only a good
working hypothesis, but for which be thinks tliat the evidence he has already col-
lected makes out a strong probability.

    He uses the term metamorphic for those rocks onlv in wliicli there has becM

a complete re-arrangement of the constituent minerals, and excludes therefore all
merely consolidated matter, though crystallised as limestones, compacted as quartzite
or veined, or filled with replacing minerals, as chert, or crumpled, which he con-

siders merely an accident which may ha](peu to an ordinary sedimentary or to a
metamorphic rock, and the cause and mode of occurrence of which he explains.

     The difficulty with regard to the Amlwch and Holyhead beds arose from

considering them metamorphic, an impression derived from their gnarled and con-

torted appearance. He describes tlie sequence commonly found among the lower

beds of the series, from the constancy of which he infers that no large mass of

them is faulted out of sight in the Amlwch district. He points out the agreement
of these sections with some of those in the Holjdiead area. lie gives a number of

sections along the border country between them and the black slates, which seem
to indicate a passage up from the slates into satiny beds, which when consisting
of rapid alternations of soft material, and hard unyielding bands, become contorted
and gnarled.

      If these sections cannot be explained away, the felspathic gnarled rocks must

be either the marine equivalents of the Bala volcanic series, or the result of a later

(probably Silurian) denudation of those beds. As Lower Mny Hill ( =Birkhill)

fossils only occur in the slates immediately south of the area in question, the latter

supposition is the only one tenable in the present state of the evidence.

The object of this paper is to remove certain prevailing misconceptions on the

aim and scope of Geology. The accepted definition of Geology as ' the history of

the earth's crust and the fossils it contains ' is shown to be both too wide and too

narrow                                       too  wide  since  it  includes Paheontology, which so far as it is a study of
                                          ;

forms f life belongs to Biology, and too narrow since the science of the whole

earth necessarily embraces much more than a study of its crust. Geology is one

of a group of three concrete sciences, which are Astronomy, Geology, and Biology.

The scope of Geology, as the science of the earth, is so wide that a "fresh classifica-

Petrology, Litbolog}', Mineralogy, correspond to Anatomy and Ilistology in

Biology, minerals, rocks, and rock masses constituting the earth's crust as cells,
tissues, organs constitute living organisms ; while Palffiogeography is a study of
successive morphological states corresponding to Embryology or Development.

     Physiological Geology considers the movements of the earth as a whole, and of
all activities produced upon it by extrinsic and intrinsic force-;, acting singly or
in combination ; it rightly includes Meteorology and Ilydrologj^, as well as the

IG. On the Exploration of a Fissure in the Mountain Limestone at H.aygill.

                        Bij James W. Davis, F.G.S., F.L.S.

About eight years ago attention was called, by R. H. Tiddeman, M.A., of

II.M. Geol. Survey, to a iissure in the limestone quarry at Raygill, in Lothers-

dale, about live miles from Skipton. It originally opened to the surface, and

during repeated operations in quarrying was found to extend almost vertically into
the rock, trending slightly in a southerly direction. The mouth of the fissure was

closed up by a thiclaiess of blue clay with limestone boulders several yards in

--depth, which appears to have been similar to other masses of blue clay in the

immediate neighbourhood the result of glacial action. Underlying this there

were successive deposits of jellow clay; a considerable thickness of finely laminated

clay, of a bluish colour, tine and unctuous to the touch ; and alternating layers of
sand and sandy clay, with numerous angular and subangular masses of limestone

and grit-rock.
     Neither of the beds enumerated contained fossils, but still lower a brown s.indy

clay was found, witli numerous well-rounded, water-worn pebbles of limestone

and sandstone, apparently all derived from the rocks in the neighbourhood. Inter-
mixed with the clays and stones of this bed were numerous bones and teeth. The

f^And. and clays surrounding the bones were cemented Hrnily together, fcirming a

hard enveloping matrix, and as the bones when found are soft and friable, it is

with difficulty that they can be extracted except in fragments. In 1879, the

quarrying operations had exposed the latter stratum, and the presence of numerous

hones' led the Council of the Yorkshire Geological Society to decide that a scientific
investigation of the fissure should be attempted, with the result that a special

fund was obtained, and with the ready permission and co-operation of Mr. Spencer,
the proprietor of the quarrj', operations were carried on during the summer of

1880. The course of the fissure was exposed to a further depth of nearly 50 feet,

in that distance extending 19 feet into the rock from the face of the quarry.

It was then found that the fissure extends nearly horizontally, in an easterly

direction, which can be followed for about 40 feet, whilst a second branch
extends in a southerly direction and appears to fall rapidly. The whole surface

of the fissure is abraded and smoothened as by running water, and the limestone
in its vicinity is extensively honeycombed. The excavation has resulted in the

discovery of numerous bones of Elephas, including fragments of a tusk 7 inches in

diameter, and many molar teeth.  Teeth  and  tusks  of Hippopotamus                                                                      teeth  of

C. Capreuhis. The teeth of hyena are numerous, and one or two examples of those

Aof the Lion have been found.    single molar tooth of the bear has also been

found, and tliere are some smaller bones which have not been identified.
     The mouth of the fissure is near the summit of an anticlinal which brings the

limestone to the surface at Raygill. On either side are hills, composed principally

of shale, surmounted by gritstone, dipping north and south ; towards the west also

the ground rises, and a iault brings down the gritstone into juxtaposition with the
limestone, so that on three sides the mouth of the fissure is surrounded by moor-

lands of gritstone. It appears probable that a stream ran from this surface of

gritstone and emptied itself into the fissure, from whicli were deposited the sandy
and clayey matters which gradually filled it. The animals whose bones are found
in the fissure no doubt frequented the district through which the stream ran, and
their skeleton remains were washed into the fissure along with the rounded stones

and boulders found associated with them. It may perhaps be inferred, from the

fact that the fine blue clay is superimposed on all the other beds, that the organic
remains found in the fissure are preglacial or interglacial in age, because the dis-
trict drained by the stream is entirely composed of grit-rocks ; and it is only by the
agency of glaciers that the limestone forming the blue clays could be conveyed to
so high elevations, prior to its re-deposition in the fissure.

     The two species of refalodus,\iz.2mttacim(s,Ag.,ani sagittatus, Ag.,are included
in the new genus PetalorJnjnchus, as well as that of Choimrfoclus tnmcatus, Ag. The
characters and arrangement of the teeth, discovered since Professor Agassiz insti-
tuted these genera, sliow that they extended in circular rows of probably seven
teeth in each upper and lower jaw. In front of these are four or five vertical rows
of disused teeth, which appear to serve the purpose of strengthening and support-
ing the row in use. In manj^ respects they are similar to the genus Janassa,
Munster, and with it appear to occupy an intermediate position between the
genus Myliohates and Cestraciontes, approaching nearer to the characters possessed
by the rays than the sharks.

    A number of teeth have been found in the Yorkshire Limestone, which were

ascribed by Professor Agassiz to tlie genus Petalorhynchus. They differ most
 materially from that genus. In Diodontopsodus the teeth are extremely like the
 single teeth of the existing fish, Diodon, in which the two rami of each jaw have
 coalesced to form a single, bony, enamel-tipped inciso-palatal tooth, whilst in
 Petalorhynchus the teeth are strong, with a long and thick base, the crown being
 thin, sharp, aud spatulate ; the teeth of Diodontopsodus liave no basal prolonga-
 tion, are hollow, and appear to have been attached to a cartilaginous jaw.

                                          Gkat, B.Sc, F.B..8.F.
       This paper is divided into two parts. The first part treats for the most part of
  mechanical contrivances designed by the authors for the purpose of earthquake
 investigation. It was pointed out that many of the instruments formerly in use
  for such purposes gave very indefinite results, and hence were at the most only
  entitled to the name seismoscopes.

       ' The substance of this paper has been published under the title 'Earthquake
  Observations and Experiments in Japan,' in the Philusojihical Magazine for Novem-

  ber, 1881.
TRANSACTIONS OF SBCTION C.  647

     Several very sensitive forms of seismoscopes were described, such as tlie

' tremor indicator ' and ' circuit-closer seismoscope,' fidl descriptions of -which will
shortly appear in the 'Transactions' of ihe Seismological Society of Japan for 1881.

   A large number of different contrivances for the purpose of measuring jvccurately

the amplitude, period, and direction of motion at any instant during an earthquake-

shock is referred to. For descriptions of such contrivances reference may be
made to the * Philosophical Magazine ' for September 1881, and to the ' Transac-

tions ' of the Asiatic Society of Japan for 1880-81, in one or other of which
accounts of most of them will be found.

     The second part of the paper treats of earthquake motion generally; the
different modes of determining theoretically and practicalh' the rates of propaga-
tion of an earthquake wave ; the effect of continued action onthe ai-ea afl'ected ; the
different modes of determining the origin ; the effects of earthquakes on buildings
of different form and in different situations; the proper mode of determining
the intensity of an earthquake-shock ; the explanation of the rotation of bodies by

earthquakes, &c.

      It is pointed out that earthquake-motion is generally of a very irregular

character, that it usually begins gradually, reaches a maximum somewhat suddenly,

and afterwards passes through several minima and maxima. The period of vibra-
tion of a great number of earthquakes observed by the authors, varied between
one-half and one-fifth of a second, while the total time of disturbance varied
from one-half to three minutes. Reasons are given for believing that earth-
quakes which last for a long time are propagated farther than those which last for
a short time, even when the intensity of the latter is the greater.

    With regard to the determination of the origin of sliock, the great value of
accurate time-observations is pointed out, and a sketch of several different modes

of making such observations is given.
     The eff"ect of an earthquake on a building appears to depend mostly on the

nature of its foundation (the best probably being a somewhat broad concrete foun-
dation resting on a soft bottom) ; the agreement or non-agreement of the vibrational
period of the different parts ; and the situation of the building, it being unsafe to
build near the edge of a plateau, or near the junction of a plain with a steep hill

or cliff.
      It is pointed out that in estimating the intensity of an earthquake-shock the

maximum velocity of a particle on the earth's surface during the shock should be

taken, and that the intensity is best measured in terms of the square of this
velocity. In other words the intensity is proportional to amplitude of movement,
and inversely proportional to square of period. The usual explanation of the
rotation of bodies during a shock, namely, that of vortex movement, is referred

to, and it is pointed out that this is not likely to produce the rotation in question ;
but, on the other hand, that if a direct backward and forward movement be given in

proper direction a rotation will take place. For simplicity, the body may be

supposed to have a rectangular base. If the direction of the shock is at right
angles to one of the sides or along one of the diagonals, no rotation will take place;

but if it be inclined to either of these directions, it may be resolved into two com-

ponents, one of which tilts the body up in one corner while the other rotates it
round that corner as a pivot. The application of this to the determination of

direction is referred to.

cussed were :- a. Colours and signs for Geological Maps ; h. Nomenclature of rocks
and formations; c. Nomenclature of species. This paper was concerned only with

the first of these questions, and especially with the resolutions passed by the

English Map-Committee, of which Prof, Hamsay is President, and the author

Secretary.

At present, all countries, and many map-makers in each country, have different

systems of colouring maps, and it is necessary carefully to study the Index, or scale

of colours used, before the maps can be at all understood. The Congress proposes

to frame a scheme of colouring which can be used, and readily understood, by all

nations. It may not be possible, at least for some time to come, to apply this

scheme to national surveys in progress ; but it is to be hoped that the scheme

to be adopted will be used in new maps. One important point which the Congress

proposes is the preparation and publication of a general map or atlas of Europe,

compiled (under the authority of the Congress) from various national surveys, and

the work of independent observers.

The scheme of colouring proposed by the English Committee is one based on

the order of colours in the solar spectrum, violet denoting the oMer rocks.

Bright reds are reserved for igneous rocks. Me tamorphic rocks will be shown by

dark bands of colour over the colour denoting the age; to these will be added

bands of colour showing the period at which metamorphism has taken place,

when  such fact is  clearly established                                                                                         thus,  Silurian  rocks metamorphosed  in
                                                                                                                             ;

Cretaceous times would be shown by violet, striped with alternate lines of dark

violet and green. The sub-divisions of a formation will be shown by shades

of the body colour, the darkest shade denoting the oldest sub-division. The

letter denoting the formation will be the capital initial letter of the name of the
formation. With very small accommodations one system of lettering can be made

to apply to all countries.

It has been found impossible to adhere strictly to the order of colours of the

spectrum, and an interpolation has been made of browns and greys for the series

of beds between the Silurian and the Lias.
     Examples of maps and tables of strata were exhibited, coloured according to

the plan adopted. Also a series of indexes of colours issued at various dates by

the Geological Survey, commencing with one, in MS., by Sir II. Ue la Beche,

the founder and tirst Director-General of the Survey; this was made in 1882. The

author also drew  attention  to  a  proposal, made                                                                                     by  W.Mr. J.  Salter, before this

Association in 1847,' and again in a map exhibited at the International Exhibition

in London, in 1862, to colour Geological maps in the order of colours of the solar

5. 0)1 the Glacial Geologij of Central Wales. Btj Walter Keeping, M.A,,
                              F.G.S., Kee'per of the Yorlc Museum.

     Cardiganshire and the neighbouring counties of Central Wales form a moun-
tainous tract of country, consisting of rounded, grass-covered hills, often with
flattened peaty summits. Geologically, the district consists of monotonous repe-
titions of grit, and greywacke, shales and slates.

     The most important physical features are the two great planes of marine
denudation which limit the tops of the hills at heights of 500 ft. sloping up to
700 ft., and 1,100 to 1,500 ft. respectively. The drift-deposits range over both these
hill-groups, stretching up to within 100 ft. of the highest points.

      All the drifts in the central part of the district are of local origin, the materials
being derived from within the limits of the present drainage-areas. Glaciated
rock-surfaces are left in perfect preservation, excellent examples being seen in the

roches movtonnees of the Llyfnant valley, and many other places. The stony clay
or Till consists generally of a matrix of amorphous, stiff blue clay, crowded with

small angular grains and shaly fragments. This paste is thickly studded with

                    ' Jtejwrt of the British Association for 1847. Sections, f.9.

 rocks of all sizes, from mere fragments to large masses several tons in -weight.
 Most of these stones are subangular, and well striated ; a few are rounded, and
 others are unworn and angular. In the clitFs four miles south of Aberystwith, this
 formation occupies an old river-bed in a former valley, who-e western hill-boun-
 dary has been destroyed by marine denudation ; also the rock here has been eiiten
 away by streamlet and pluvial denudation into fantastic gorges and columns, some
 of the latter being true earth-pillars, like those of 13otzen in the Tyrol. Moraines
are of common occurrence, but they consist of more clayey material than usual,
 which results from the argillaceous character of the surrounding rocks. In some

cases they occur at the foot of lakes.

     Erratic blocks are abundant, occurring at heights above 1,000 ft. They are
 often found along the sides of valleys, where they appear to have been stranded

after being launched off from the sides of the subsiding glaciers. All are
local rocks, and it is only in the extreme north and .south that boulders from

beyond the present drainage-areas occur. In the Llyfnant valley, S.W. of Ma-
chynlleth, huge boulders of felsite from the Cader Idris and Aran range of moun-
tains are found, they having been carried over the pass by the North Wales ice,
-which overflowed beyond the Dy ti valley. In the south the Teifi valley at Cardigan
-was invaded by a large glacier, whose birthplace -was in the mountains of Caer-

marthenshire. I^akes and lakelets are abundant, especially on the higher plateaux.
They are all rock-basins, mostly shallow, and of irregular outline. One of them
(Llyn Llygad Kheidol) was apparently ice-formed ; the rest cannot be. These evi-
dences show that Central Wales was covered with snow and ice during the Glacial

period; but all the glaciers of which we have any traces were of strictly local
character, each confined to its own drainage-area in the present valley system.
There is no evidence of any great mer de ylace, or of any marine submergence in

recent geological times.

           6. On sovie points in the Morphology of the Hhahdojjhora.
                            B[i John Hopkinson, F.L.S., F.G.S.

     Professor McCoy (' Brit. Pal. Foss.' 1854) speaks of transverse diaphragms at

 the base of the calycles (hydrothecce) of certain graptolites, dividing the calycles

from the common canal or perisarc. No further allusion appears to have been

 made to the presence of any diaphragms or septa until, in 18G8, the author
 mentioned (' Journ. Quek. Micr. Club,' vol. i.) having observed ' an impressed line
 between the hydrothcCEe and the periderm' (perisarc), which was compared with

 that 'at the base of the hydrothecae in the Sertulariadte.'

     More recently Professor AUman (' Mon. Tubularian Ilydroids.' 1872), not

admitting the presence of any septum or constriction, has compared the calycles of
the Rhabdophora to the nematophores of the Plumularidaj.

    A few days ago the author examined an extensive collection of graptolites made

by Mr. W. Kinsey Dover, of Keswick, from the Skiddaw Slates, amongst which

are a few specimens showing internal structure, most clearly defined in Didi/mo-

(/raptus nitidus and patuhis, and Tetrcujraptus serra. In several specimens of these
species (exhibited) the thecas are seen to be separated from the perisarc by a dis-
tinctly-marked septum which seems usually to form a right angle with the theciie.
 The perisarc is, moreover, in specimens of all the three species, seen to be
jointed, or crossed by transverse septa, there being one septum to each tbeca.

The appearance is therefore that of a common perisarc divided into chambers, from

each of which a single isolated hydrotheca is produced.
     These appearances are not confined to the graptolites of the Skiddaw Slates,

having been noticed by the author in well-preserved specimens from the Ludlow
rocks, and it is believed to be owing to the imperfect state of preservation in which
graptolites usuallj' occur that they are not more frequently seen. The true inter-
pretation of the appearances presented is believed to be that the septa which seem

to completely cut off the thecse from the perisarc, and the sections of the perisarc
from each other, only partially do so, as in the recent Thecaphora ; and the author
concluded that these specimens show that the calycles of the graptolites are true

hydrothecre, and do not in any way invalidate the conclusion arrived at from pre-

vious investit^ations into the morphology of the llliabdophora, that they are the
PalaBozoic representatives of the recent Hydroida.

               7. On some Ores and Minerals from Lauriuyn, Greece.
                                       jByU. Stoves, F.G. 8.

     The metals of Greece are numerous and pay to work. The quantity of gold is
small, but at Doliana a bed of pyrites yields from 14 to 18 dwts. per ton. Most
abundant metals are lead and zinc, with a large quantity of silver mixed, and some
copper. Several mining companies now working successful!)' ; at present chiefly
washing and re-smelting the scoriae left by ancient miners. Formerly mining in
Attica was verj' largely carried on over 60,000 acres of ground worked, and upwards
of 2,000 galleries and shafts still remain, some as perfect as if left but yesterday.
The shafts vary from 20 to 140 j'ards deep. Excavations commence from narrow
galleries to wide chambers, ;i0 feet high and of great length. Vast numbers must
have been worked, as of the scoriiB left over 2,000,000 tons are officially reported
to exist, and manj' vast heaps were not measured. Taking the quantity stated, and
allowing nothing for other loss, upwards of 2,000,000 tons of lead, and 8,2-jO tons
of silver, are thus known to have been extracted, chiefly by Athenians. Existing

ores contain 6o% of lead. The scoritc still retain 10% and pay to work. Silver

is invariably mixed. Tlie argentiferous lead occurs in veins and pockets in granite,
mica-schists, trachyte, limestones, &c. (sometimes in great masses). Zinc occurs
chiefly in veins in limestone rocks, close-grained marble, sometimes in pockets,
frequently mixed with other metals. Although copper and nickel are present in
paying quantities, at present they are not worked. Attica is a great held for
mining industry, and Greece will in a few years add largely to her wealth from
her minerals. In addition to those mentioned, coal (lignite), marble, sulphur,

emery, arsenic, manganese, iron, barytes, and many other minerals of excellent

quality and in great abundance, are already being worked.

 quantity of brine produced, whether wholly issuing as springs or partially inter-
 cepted by artificial works, is limited by the area of percolation, alone occurring
 along the line of the original outcrop of the rock-salt. The effect of rainfall,

      The sections are described by Professor Hughes ('G. M.' vol. iv.), but the age
 of the beds is not definitely determined. The beds are as follows :

      Austwick Beck, conglomerate resting unconformably on Bala beds, interstratified
 with black shale, passing up into deposit of similar shales. These black shales,
 surmounted by flaggy bed three to four inches thick, with Phacops clegmis, Boeck

 & Sars. Above this are pule green shales, and theiL flags with Monograptus

 jniodon and M. vomeriiuts. Similar section at Crumwaik Beck Head.
      In Lake district, bed, with Phacops elegans, lies between graptolitic mud.stones

 and pale shales, and lithological characters of beds precisely similar to those of beds
 near Austwick. Phacops elegans, hitherto unrecorded in England, is characteristic

 of May Hill species, and thus forms useful fossil for determining horizon.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.

    The Peesident delivered tlie following Address :

The recent construction of the edifice of the 'British Museum (Natural History),

Cromwell Road,' ' and the transference thereto of three of the Departments, the
systematic airangemeut of which in their respective galleries approaches closely to

completion, have left me little leisure in the present year for other scientific work.
The expression, moreover, in divers forms and degrees, of the satisfaction and

instruction such partial exhibition of the national treasures of natural history has
afforded to all classes of visitors since the galleries were open to the public, in

April last, encourages me to believe that a few words on this great additional
instrument in advancing Biological Science may not be unacceptable to the Section
of the British Association which I have now the honour to address.

    It is true that when we last met at Swansea, my accomplished colleague, Dr.

Albert Giinther, F.R.S., selected a general description of the building as the
subject of his address to Section D.

     I was unwilling then, in consideration of the time of the Section already given
to the matter, to respond to appeals of some of our fellow-members for information

as to how, and through whom, the new Museum came to be, and to be where it is
but now, honoured by my present position, I venture to hope that a brief outline

of its genetic history, which I have been preparing for publication in a fuller form,

may be condoned.

      In the actual phase of Biology, its cultivators, especially the younger genera-
tion, do not rest upon the determination and description, however minute and'
exhaustive, of the acquisitions so rapidly accumulating of objects or species 'new
to science,' but devote themselves also, and more especially, to the investigation of
their developmental phenomena.

     It has therefore seemed to me that it would not be inappropriate, as being

germane to the present phase of research, to submit to the Section a few words on

the genesis of this new national edifice, generously provided by tlie State for the

promotion of our sciences of natural history.

     On the demise, in 1856, of Sir Henry Ellis, K.T., then Principal Librarian of
the British Museum, the Government, made aware of the growth of the depart-

ments of natural history, more especially of geology and paleontology, since the

foundation of the Museum in 17o.'>, when the collections of printed books and

manuscripts predominated, determined that, together with a principal librarian,

there should be associated a new ofUcial having special charge of the collections of
natural history, but under similar subordinate relations to the Trustees. To this
official was assigned the title of ' Superintendent of the Departments of Natural

History,' and I had the honour to be selected for this olBce.*

     ' The official designation assigned by the Trustees to the building and its contents,

    * The date of my appointment is May 26, 185G.
--652 KEPORT 1881.

Almost ray first work was to ascertain the extent of my charges, and I confess

that I was unprepared to find that the galleries assigned for the arrangement and

public exhibition of the several natural history series in the British Museum were
so inadequate to these ends as to necessitate the storage of many unexhibited, and

in great proportion rare and valuable specimens. This condition afiected principally

the collection of fossil remains, but in not much less degree that of the recent

natural history.

    One of my colleagues, Mr. Charles Konig, then Keeper of the Department of

Mineralog}', and most eminent in that science, applied the gallery assigned thereto

principally to the rare and beautiful specimens of his favourite subject. When the

newer science of palfeontology entered upon its rapid growth, and, on the demise

of Mr. Konig, led to the formation of a distinct Department of Geology, the pro-

portion of the British Museum set apart for natural history would not aiford for the

exhibition of the fossils and rock specimens more or other space than might be

gained from or intercalated among the mineral cabinets in one and the same gallery,

viz. that which had been originally assigned to Mr. Kiinig.

    The store-vaults in the basement of the Museum became accordingly invaded

by the rapidity-accumulating unexhibited geological specimens, as those receptacles

bad been, and continued to be, needed for the storage of such specimens, and

especially the osteological ones, of the Department of Zoology.

In 18o4, Dr. .John Ed. Gray, Keeper of the Zoology, reported on the unfitness of

the locality of his stored specimens, and prayed for additional accommodation for

them.* But, on the report of the architect, to whom such appeal was referred, the

Trustees 'declined to adopt Dr. Gray's suggestion,' and recommended 'that steps

should be taken to obviate the deterioration of the specimens complained of by Dr.

Gray in consequence of the damp condition of tlio vaults in which they are con-

tained.' ^ To renewed appeals by the experienced Keeper, and agreeably with his

--ideas on the nature and extent of the required additional space for the Zoology, the

Trustees recommended : ' An additional gallery to the Eastern Zoological Gallerj^

and the substitution of skylights for the side windows,' with a view to an additional

--gallery at an elevation above the floor of the one in use ; they also resolved :

' That accommodation be provided for the officers of the Natural History Depart-
ments on the roof of the Print-room.' ^

But the inadequacy for exhibition-purposes of additional space which might be

gained by the new gallery, or by the accessory wall-gallery attainable by stairs in

mythe one in use,'' was so impressed on  convictions, that I determined, in 1857, to

submit to the Trustees a statement embodying estimates of space required for

exhibition of all and several the Departments of natural history, with the grounds

of such estimates, including considerations based upon the ratio of increase during

the ten years preceding my appointment, and the conditions likely to afl'ect the

proportions of future annual additions.

This purpose, which I deemed a duty, I endeavoured to effect in a ' Report,

with a Plan,' submitted on February 10, 1859, which Ileport, being forwarded by

the Trustees to the Treasury, and being deemed worthy of consideration by Par-

liament, was 'Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed, March 11, 13.59,'

and can still be obtained at the Office of Parliamentary Papers.^

The Report included, as I have stated, estimates of space for the then acquired

specimens of the several departments of natural history, together with space for

the reception of the additional specimens which might accrue in the course of a

   --' See Parliamentary Paper or Blue P.ook, folio 18.58, entitled: 'Copies of all

zoological collections is exhibited to the public, and their due di.splay would require

--more than twice the space devoted to thcrn.' Ibid. p. 21. To any removal of the

natural history to another site Dr. Gray was strongly opposed.

generation, or thirty years. It further recommended that such museum-building,

besides giving the requisite accommodation to the several classes of natural history
objects, as they had been by authority exhibited and arranged for public instruction
and gratification, should also include a hall, or exhibition-space for a distinct
department, adapted to convey an elementary knowledge of the subjects of all the
divisions of natural history to the large projportion of public visitors not specially
conversant with any of those subjects.

    I may crave permission to quote from that part of my Ileport which lias

received the sanction of the ' Commission on the Advancement of .Science' of 1874
' One of the most popular and instructive features in a public collection of natural
history would be an apartment devoted to the specimens selected to show type-

characters of the principal groups of organised and crystallised forms. This would
constitute an epitome of natural history, and should convey to the eye in the easiest
way, an elementary knowledge of the sciences.'

    An estimate of the space required for such apartment is given, and it has been
obtained in the new Museum of Natural History.

     I ventured also on another topic in connection with the more immediate object

of my Report. Previous experience at the museum of the Iloyal College of

Surgeons had impressed me with the influence on improved applications of col-

lections and on the ratio of their growth, through Lectures expository of their

nature. I felt confident that, with concurrence of authorities, both relations would

be exemplified under the actual superintendence at the British Museum. More-
over, such museum of natural history has wider influences over possessors and

collectors of rarities and of desiderated specimens than one of restricted kind as

myin Lincoln's Inn Fields. I concluded  Report, therefore, bv referring to the

my mylecture theatre shown in
       plan, and expressed              belief tha't ' Adrainistrators

will consider it due to the public that the gentlemen in charge of the several

departments of the National Collection of Natural History should have assigned to
them the duty of explaining the principles and economical relations of such depart-

ments, in elementary and free lectures, as, e.g. on Ethnology, Mammalogy, Orni-
thology, Herpetology and Ichthyology, Malacology and Conchologv, Entomology,

Zoophytology, Botany, Geology, PaL-e ontology. Mineralogy.'

     After the lapse of twenty j'ears I have lived to see the fulfilment of all the recom-

mendations, save the final one, of my Report of 1859. The lecture-theatre was
erased from my plan, and the elementary courses of lectures remain for future fulfil-

ment.

     Considering that, in the probable communication of this Report to Parliament,
I was addressing the representatives of the greatest commercial and colonising

nation in the globe, representatives of an empire exercising the widest range of
navigation and supreme in naval power, such nation and empire might well be ex-
pected by the rest of the civilised world to otter to students and lovers of natural

history the best and noblest museum of the illustrations of that great division of

general science.

     But for such a museum, a site or superficial space of not less than eight acres
was asked for, the proportion of such space to be occupied by the proposed build-
ing to be limited and dependent upon architectural arrangement in one, two, or
more storeys. But the eftect of restricting the site or available superficial space to
that, e.g. on which the Museum at Bloomsbury now stands, was significantly

demonstrative of difficulties to come, and concomitantly indicative of the adminis-
trative wisdom which would be manifested by securing, in a rapidly growing

metropolis, adequate space for future additions to the building which might be in
the first place erected thereupon.

    Nevertheless one or two of my intimate and confidential fiiends dissuaded me

from sendmg in a Report which might be construed or misinterpreted as exemplifj--

ing a character prone to inconsiderate and extravagant views, and such as might
even lead to disagreeable personal consequences. Moreover the extent of space

reported for seemed inevitably to involve change of locality. Two of my colleagues
occupied the elegant and commodious residences attached to the British Museum

       ' Report, id supra, p. 22.
--654
                            EEroKT 1881.

and it was possible that provision for sucli residences marked in the plan whicli

accompanied my report might not be adopted. Moreover no statement of grounds

for adequate space-requirements for the whole of the National Natural History had
previously been submitted to authority. The legislative mind had not been pre-

pared for calm and due consideration of the subject. Still I flattered myself that,

by whomsoever the details and aims and grounds of mj' report were known and

comprehended, any strong opposition on the part of Parliament could hardly be

expected. Nevertheless, an Irish member, seeing a way to a position in ' The House,'
which is gained by the grant of a Committee of Inquiry, of which the mover be-

comes chairman, made my Report and Plan the ground of a motion to that effect,

which was carried. The Select Committee, after taking the evidence published in
the Blue Book (ordered to be printed August 10, 1860, quarto, pp. 238, with teu
plans), reported against the removal of the Natural History Collections from the

]3ritish Museum. As to the chief reasons alleged for such removal the Report
states that with one ' eminent exception the whole of the scientific naturalists

examined before your Committee, including the Keepers of all the Departments of
Natural History in the British Museum, are of opinion that an exhibition on so
large a scale tends alike to the needless bewilderment and fatigue of the public,

and the impediment of the studies of tlie scientific visitor .... Your Committee,

therefore, recommend the adoption of the more limited kind of exhibition advocated
bj' the other witnesses, in preference to the more extended method recommended

by Professor Owen.'
     Lest, however, the House might attach undue weight to the exceptional testi-

mony, the chairman of the Committee deemed it his duty, in bringing up the

Report, to warn the House of the character of such testimony, and his speech
left, as I was told, a very unfavourable impression as regards myself. I was chiefly
concerned to know what might be put upon record in ' Hansard.' In that valuable

work Hon. Members revise their reported utterances before the sheets go to press.
I was somewhat relieved to find Mr. Gregory regretting that ' a man whose name
stood so high should connect himself with so foolish, crazj', and extravagant a
scheme, and should persevere in it after the folly had been pointed aut by most

unexceptionable witnesses.

    * They had on one side, and standing alone. Professor Owen and his ten- acre
scheme, and on the other side all the other scientific gentlemen, who were per-
fectly unanimous in condemning the plan of Professor Owen as being utterly useless

and bewildering.

    ' Among these gentlemen were Professor Huxley, Professor Maskelyne, Mr.

Waterhouse, Dr. Gray, Sir Roderick Mnrchison, Mr. Thomas Bell, P.G.S., Dr.
Sclater, Sec. Z.S., Mr. Gould, and Sir Benjamin Brodie. To give the House some

idea of that gigantic plan, he might mention that a part of it consisted of galleries

850 feet in length for the exhibition of whales. The scientific men e.xamiued on

the subject, one and all, disapproved of that plan in f.oto ; and they advocated

what was technically called a " typical mode of exhibition." ' ^

    In point of fact "that Supplementary Exhibition Room which was planned and

recommended for the purpose I liave already cited, was urged as the sole reasonably
required National Museum of Natural Historj', for which the nation ought to be

called upon to provide space and funds, a conclusion subsequently adopted and
unanimously recommended by the Royal Commission on Science."

Although grief was natural and considerable at this result, not without mor-

tification at the reception by Parliament of tlie Report and Plan submitted thereto,

I now feel grateful that the sole responsibility of their author is attested in the
pages of a Work ^ which will last as long as, and may possibly outlast, the great
legislative organisation whose debates and determinations are therein authorita-

tively recorded.

I was  not,  however, ca?t  down, nor  did  I  lose  either  heart  or  hope                       I  was
                                                                                                ;

confident in the validity of the grounds of my appeal, and foresaw in the inevitable

accumulations year by year, the evidence which would attest its soundness and
make plain the emergency of tlie proposed remedy.

Moreover, there was one who, though not a naturalist, Lad devoted more time,

--pains, and thought to the subject than had been bestowed by any of those

whether naturalist or administrator who testified adversely thereon. " The Kioht

Hon. William Ewart Gladstone, an elected trustee of the British Msiseum, took

nothing on trust ; he explored with me, in 1861, every vault and dark recess in

the Museum which had been, or could be, allotted to the non-exhibited specimens

myof the natural liistorj-, those, viz., which it w.as  aim to utilize and bring to light.

He gave the same attention to the series selected for exhibition in the public

galleries, and appreciated the inadequacy of the arrangements to that end. He
mylistened to
               statements of facts, to the grounds of provision of annual ratios of

myincrease, to the reasons for providing space therefor, to  views of the aims of

such exhibitions, and to the proposed extended applications and elucidations of

the collections. Mr. Gladstone tested every averment, and elicited the grounds

of every sugf^estion, with a tact and insight tliat contrasted strongly with the

questionings in Mr. Gregory's committee-room, where too often vague interroo-a-
tions met with answers to match.

     Conformably with Mr. Gladstone's convictions, he as Chancellor of the Ex-

chequer moved. May 12, 1862, for 'Leave to bring in a Bill for removal of por-

tions of the Trustees' Collections in the British Museum.'

    On May 19, when the bill was to be read a second time, a new, unexpected, and

formidable antagonist arose. Mr. Disraeli early got the attention of the House to
a speech, warning hon. members of the 'progressive increase of expenditure on
civil estimates,' and laying stress on the fact that the 'estimates of the actual year
showed no surplus.' ^ The influence of this advocacy of economy is exemplified in
the debate which ensued.- For repetitions of the nature and terms of objections

to the Eeport and Plan, as already denounced by Mr. Gregory, Mr. Bernal Osborne,

and others, reference may be made to the volume of 'Hansard ' cited below. An

estimable hon. member, whose words had always and deservedly carried weight

--with the country party, lent his influence to the same result. Mr. Henley, repre-

sentative of Oxfordshire, said : ' All the House knew was that a building was to
be put up somewhere. He considered this a bad way of doing business, particularly
at a time when nobody could be sanguine that the finances of the country were in

a flourishing state. Let the stone once be set rolling, and then all gentlemen of
science and taste would have a kick at it, and it woidd be knocked from one

to the other, and none of them probably would ever live to see an end of the

expense.' ^

Permit me to give one more example of the baneful influence of the opening

--speech on our great instrimient of .scientific progress. Mr. Henry Seymour,

Member for Poole, said : ' If a foreigner had been listening to the debates of
that evening it must have struck him that it was, to say the least, a rather curious

coincidence that a proposal to vote 600,000^. for a new collection of birds, beasts,

and fishes at South Kensington should have been brought forward on the very

--evening when the Leader of the Opposition had made a speech denounciug that

exorbitant expenditure a speecli, he might add, which was re-echoed by'many
Liberal members of the House.' ^

     It was however not a ' curious,' but a ' designed coincidence.' Mr. Disraeli,

kno\ying the temper of the House on the subject, and that the estimates for the

required Museum of Natural History were to be submitted by Mr. Gladstone, chose

 the opportunity to initiate the business by an advocacy of economy which left its
.intended effect upon the House. In vain Lord Palmerston, in reply to the Irish

 denunciators, proposed  as  a  compromise  to  'exclude whales altogether from

1

\disporting themselves in Kensington Gardens.' ^ The Government was defeated

"ty a majority of ninety-two, and the erection of a National or British Museum of

  atural History was postponed, to all appearance indefinitely, and in reality for

.1 years,

--656 REPORT 1881.

    Nevertheless, iieitber averments nor arguments in the House on May 19, 1862,
nor testimonies in the hostile Committee of 1860, 1861, had shaken my faitli in
the oTounds on which my Report and Plan of 1S59 had been based. The facts
bearino- thereupon, which it was my duty to submit in my ' Annual Reports on the

Natural History Departments of the British Museum,' would, I still hoped, have

some influence with hon. members of the legislature to whom those Reports are

transmitted.

     The .annual additions of specimens continued to increase in number and in

value year by year. I embraced every opportunity to excite the interest of lovers
of natural history travelling abroad, and of intelligent settlers in our several

colonies, to this end, among the results of which I may cite the reception of the
Ave-Aye, the Gorilla, the Dodo, the Notornis, the maximised and elephant-footed

species of Dinornis, the representatives of the various orders and genera of extinct
Reptilia from the Cape of Good Hope, and the equally rich and numerous evidencps

of the extinct Marsupialia from Australia, besides such smaller rarities as the

animals of the Nautilus and Spirula.
     Wherever room could be found in the exhibition galleries at Bloomsbury for

these specimens, stufl'ed or as articulated skeletons, or as detached fossils, tliey
were squeezed in, so to speak, to mutely manifest to all visitors, more especially

administrative ones, the state of cram to which we were driven at Bloomsburj'.

    Another element of my 'Annual Reports' was the deteriorating influence on

valuable specimens of the storage vaults, and the danger of such accumulations to

the entire Museum and its priceless contents. And here perhaps you may deem

some explanation needful of the grounds of the latter consideration addressed to

economical grauters of the National funds.

     The number of specimens preserved in spirits of wine amounted to thousands

any accidental breakage, with conflagration, in the subterraneous localities con-
tiguous with the heating-apparatus of the entire British Museum, would have
been as destructive to the building as the gunpowder was meant to be when stored
in the vaults beneath King James's Houses of Parliament.

   --At this crisis the ' Leading Journal,' after the stormy debate of May 19, 1862,

made the following appeal to me : ' Let Mr. Owen describe exactly "the kind of

building that will answer his purpose, that will give space for his whales and light

for his humming-birds and butterflies. The House of Commons will hardly, for
very shame, give a well-digested scheme so rude a reception as it did on Monday

night.' 1

    My answer to this appeal was little more than some ampliflcation, with

additional examples, of the several topics embodied in the original Report. The
pamphlet ' On the Extent and Aims of a National Museum of Natural History,'
with reduced copies of the plans, went through two editions, and no doubt had

the eflPect anticipated by the able Editor.
      Another element of reviving hope was the acceptance by Mr. Gregory of the

government of a tropical island.

   --The sagacious Prime Minister accurately gauged the modified feeling the

 subsiding animosity-- of Parliament on the subject, and submitted (June 15, 1863)

 a motion 'for leave to purchase live acres for the required Natural History
buildino-.' The choice of locality he left to honourable members. Lord Palmerston
 pointed out that the requisite extent of site could be obtained at Bloomsbury for

 50,000/. per acre, and that it could be got at South Kensington for 10,000/. per
 acre and his lordship distinctly stated that the space, in either locality, would be

                            ;

bought for the purpose of a Museum of Natural History. The purchase of the

 land at South Kensington was accordingly voted by 267 against 135, and thus the

Government proposition was carried by a majority of 132. By this vote the

 decision of Mr. Gregory's Committee was virtually annulled.
      In a conversation with which I was favoured by Lord Palmerston, I interpose

 a warning against restriction of space, and eventually eight acres of ground we
 obtained, including the site of the Exhibition Building of 1862, opposite Cromw,

quirements of our National Museum of Natural History',

    I am lotli to trespass further on the time of the Section, but a few words may

-- --he expected from me of the leading steps to the acquisition of the present edifice,

occupying a portion about one-third of that extent of ground.

     Mr. Gladstone, adhering to the convictions which led him to submit his
financial proposition of May, 1862, honoured me, at the close of that session of

Parliament, with an invitation to Hawarden to discuss my plans for the Museum

Building ; and, after consideration of every detail, he requested that they might

be left with him. lie placed them, with my written expositions cf details, in the

hands of Sir Henry A. Hunt, C.B., responsible adviser on buildings, &c., at the
Office of Works, with instructions that they should be put into working form, so
as to support reliable estimates of cost. I was favoured with interviews with Sir
Henry, resulting in the completion of such working plans of a museum, including
a central hall, an architectural front of two storeys, and the series of single-

storeyed galleries extending at right angles to the front, as shown in my original

Plan, I was assured that such plan of building, affording the space I had reported
on, would be the basis to be suomitted to the professional architect whenever the
time might arrive for Parliamentary sanction to the cost of such building.

     Here I may remark that experiments which preceded the substitution, in
1835, of the actual Museum of the Hunterian Physiology at the Royal College of

Surgeons, for the costly, cumbrous, and ill-lit building, with its three-domed sky-

lights, which preceded it, had led to the conclusion that the light best fitted for a

museum was that in which most would be reflected from the objects and least
directly strike upon the eye ; and this was found to be effected by admittance of
the light at the angle between the wall and roof. But this plan of illumination

is possible only in galleries of one storey, or the topmost in a many-storeyed

edifice. Such system of illumination may be seen in every gallery of the museum

described to you last year at Swansea, save those of the storeys of the main body
below the skylit one, which necessitate side windows.

     I subjoin a copy of the letter from Sir Henry A. Hunt, conveying his con-
clusions respecting the plan of building discussed with him :

                                                         · 4 Parliament Street : September 25, 1862.

--My' dear Sir, I return you the drawings of the proposed Museum of Natural

History at South Kensington. In May last I told Mr. Gladstone that the probable

cost of covering five acres with suitable buildings would be about 500,000/. or

100,000/. per acre.

' The plan proposed by you will occupy about four acres, and will cost Jibout

350,000/., or nearly 90,000/. per acre.

'Having prepared sketches showing the scheme suggested by you, I have been

able to anive more nearly at the probable cost than I had the means of doing in

May last. But, after all, the difference is not great ; although the present estimate

is a more reliable one than the other. It is right, however, to state that the

disposition of the building as proposed by you will give a greater amount of

accommodation, and admit of a cheaper mode of construction, than I had calculated
upon in May (relatively with the space intended to be covered), and therefore I
think your plan far better adapted for the Museum than the plan I took the

liberty to suggest to Mr. Gladstone.

                     (Signed)                ' Believe me, &c.,

                                                            'Henry A. Hunt.'

Sir H. A. Hunt had previously formed <in estimate of cost for the Chancellor of

the Exchequer on inspection of the Report and Plan in the Parliamentary paper of

March 1859. The letter to which I refer I regard as an antidote to some previous

quotations from adverse members of Parliament.
    The working plans of Sir Henry A. Hunt were subsequently submitted for com-

petition, and the designs of the accomplished and lamented Capt. Fowke, R.E.,

obtained the award in 1864. His untimely death arrested further progress or

practical application of the prize designs.

--658 BEPORT 1881.

     In 1867, Lord Elcho pressed upon the House of Commons, through the Hunger-

ford Brido'e Committee, the Thames Embankment as a site for the New Museum

of Natural History, but unsuccessfully. The debates thereon, nevertheless, caused

some further delay.

    In 1871, a vote of 40,000^. for beginning the Museum Buildings at South

Kensington -was carried -without discussion. In 1872, a vote of 29.000?. for the
same building was opposed by Lord Elcho, but was carried by a majority of 40 (85

against 45).

     On the demise of Capt. Fowke, Mr. Alfred Waterhouse was selected as archi-
tect. He accepted the general plans which had been sanctioned and approved by
Sir H. A. Hunt and by Capt. Fowke, and I took the liberty to suggest, as I had
previously done to Capt. Fowke, that many objects of natural history might afford

subjects tor architectural ornament ; and at Mr. Waterhouse's request I transmitted
numerous figures of such as seemed suitable for that purpose. I shall presently
refer to the beautiful and appropriate style of architecture which Mr. Waterhouse

selected for this building, but am tempted to premise a brief sketch of what I
may call the ' Genealogy of the British Museum,' or what some of my fellow-
labourers, agreeably with the actual phase of our science, may prefer to call

'Phylogeny.'

     Sir Hans Sloane, M.D., after a lucrative practice of his profession in the then
flourishino- colony of Jamaica, finally settled at Chelsea, and there accumulated a

notable museum of natural history, antiquities, medals, cameos, &c., besides a
library of 50,000 volumes, including about 350 portfolios of drawings, 3,500 manu-
scripts and a multitude of prints. These specimens were specified in a MS.
catalogue of thirty-eight volumes in folio, and eight volumes in quarto. Sir Hans
valued this collection at the sum of 80,000?., but at his death, in 1753, it was

found that he had directed in his ' will ' that the whole should be offered to
Parliament for the use of the public on payment of a minor sum, in compensation
to his heirs. This offer being submitted to the House of Commons, it was agreed
to pay 20,000/. for the whole. At the same time the purchase of the Cottouian
Library and of the Harleian MSS. was included in the Bill;^

     The following are the terms of the enactment :
                  Act 26 Georf/e II., Cap. 22 (175S).-- SectI'ons IX. and X.

     " (IX.) And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that within the cities of

London or Westminster or the suburbs thereof, one general repository sliall be
erected or provided in such convenient place and in such manner as the trustees
hereby appointed, or the major part of them, at a general meeting assembled, shall
direct for the reception not only of the said museum or collection of Sir Hans
Sloane but also of the Cottonian Library and of the additions which have been or
shall be made thereunto by virtue of the last will and testament of the said Arthur
Edwards, and likewise of the said Harleian collection of manuscripts and of such
other additions to the Cottonian Library as, with the approbation of the trustees
by this Act appointed, or the major part of them, at a general meeting assembled,
shall be made thereunto in manner hereinafter mentioned, and of such other collec-
 tions and libraries as, with the like ap]n-obation, shall be admitted into the said
"·eueral repository, which several collections, additions, and library so received into
the said oeneral "repository shall remain and be preserved therein for public use to

 all posterity.

     '' (X.) Provided always that the said museum or collection of Sir Hans Sloane,

   --' In his letter of February 14, 175.3, to his friend ]Mann, Horace Walpole, then

 Jlember for Lynn, writes : ' You will scarce guess how 1 employ my time, chiefly at

 present in the guardianship of embryos and cockle-shells. Sir Hans Sloane is dead,

 and has made me one of the trustees of his museum, which is to be offered for twenty

 thousand pounds to the King and Parliament, and (in default of acceptance) to the

 Royal Academies of Petersburg, Berlin, Paris, and Madrid. He valued it at four-score
 thousand, and so would any one who loves hippopotamuses, sharks with one ear, and

 spiders as bi? as geese. The King has excused himself, saying he did not think that
 there were twenty thousand pounds in the Treasury.' Letters to Iforace Jfann, 8vo,

in all its branches, shall be kept and preserved together in the said general reposi-
tory whole and entire, and with proper marks of distinction."

     The trustees appointed under the Act are of four classes : Royal, Official,
Family, and Elected. The tirst class includes one trustee appointed by the

Sovereign ; the second class includes the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord

High Chancellor, the Speaker of the Plouse of Commons, and twenty-two other*

high officials and presidents of societies. The three first in this class are designated

' Principal Trustees,' and in them is vested the patronage or appointment to every

salaried office save one  in the British  Museum                                  the exception being  the  Principal

collections are now represented by the Earl of Derby and the" Earl of Cadogan, the

Cottonian Library by the Rev. Francis Annesley and the Rev. Francis Hauljury

Annesley, the Harleian manuscripts by Lord Henry C. G. Gordon-Lennox, M.P.,

and by the Right Hon. George A. F. Cavendish Bentinck, M.P. Among t!;e

Elected Trustees the honoured name of Walpole, associated with the origin of the
British Museum, is continued by the Right Hon. Spencer Horatio Walpole, M.P.,

to whom the requisite Parliamentary business of the Museum is usually confided.

    I may call attention to the ' suburbs of London or Westminster ' as one of the

localities specified in the original Act of Parliament, and such situation was

selected for the locality of the Library and the Museum. The Government issued

lottery tickets to the amount of 300,000/., out of the profits of which the 20,000/.

for the Sloanian Museum was paid, and purchase made of a suitable building,

      ·with contiguous grounds for its reception and the lodgment of keepers.

           To the north of the metropolis, about midway between the two cities of
      London and Westminster, there stood, in 1753, an ancient family mansion called
      Montague House. This is defined by Smollett in his 'History of England 'as
      ' one of the most magnificent edifices in England.' ' Its style of architecture was
     that of the Tuileries in Paris. From London it was .shut off by a lofty brick
      wall, in the middle of which was a large ornamental gateway and lodge, through

     which, in my earlier years as a student of natural history, I have often passed to

      inspect, through the kindness of the then keepers of mineralogy and zoology, and

       maJve notes on, the Sloanian and subsequently-added rarities.

          To the north of Montague House were the extensive gardens, beyond which
      stretched away a sylvan scene to the slopes of Highgate and Hampstead Hills.

          The original location of the British Museum was more apart and remote from

     the actual metropolis and less easy of access than is the present Museum of
     Natural History at the West End.

           The additions to the natural history series, which accrued from 1753 to 1833,
      together with the growth of other departments, necessitated provision of corre-

      sponding conservative and exhibition spaces. These were acquired by the erection,
      on the site of Montague House, of the present British Museum, the architect. Sir
      Sidney Smirke, adopting the Ionic Greek style.

           The extent of space afforded by this edifice, in comparison with that of its
      predecessor, was such as to engender a conviction that it would suffice for all
      subsequent additions. The difficulty in our finite nature and limited capacity of

    looking forward is exemplified in such names as New College at Oxford, Newcastle,.
     New Street, New Bridge, &c., as if nothing was ever to grow old ; and the same

      restricted power of outlook afl'ects our prevision of requirements of space for

I ever-growing collections.

       . T^® Printed Book Department, which took the lion's share of the then new
    British Museum, found itself compelled, in the course of one generation, to^

    appropriate the quadrangle left by Smirke in order to admit light to the windows
    of the galleries looking that way or inwards.
l^ From analogy I foresee that some successor of mine may exemplify human

J^ short-sightedness in my limit of demand to eight acres for the growth of the present

teJ Museum.

have at last been acquii'ed for due display and facilities of study of the subjects of

our ' Sections G and D.'
     Amongst the works of architectural art which adorn the metropolis, West-

minster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral stand supreme. Of later additions may
with them be named the noble example of the Perpendicular Gothic selected by
Barry for the Houses of Parliament, and I may be permitted to add, the new Law

Courts, which exemplify the more severe style of the Thirteenth-century Gotliic.

      Mr. Alfred Waterhouse, E.A., for the realisation of the plans and requirements

of our Museum of Natural History, has chosen an adaptation of the Round-arched
Gothic, Romanesque, or Romaic of the twelfth century. No style could better

lend itself to the introduction, for legitimate ornamentation, of the endless beautiful

varieties of form and surface-sculpture exemplified in the animal and vegetable

kingdoms. But the skill in which these varieties have been selected and combined

to produce unity of rich efiects will ever proclaim Mr. Waterhouse's supreme

mastery of his art.

I need only ask the visitor to pause at the grand entrance, before lie passes into

the impressive and rather gloomy vestibule which leads to tlie great hall, and

prepares him for the flood of light displaying the richly- ornamented colimiuji,

arcades, and galleries of the Index Museum.

In the construction of a building for the reception and preservation of natural

history objects, the material should be of a nature that will least lend itself to

the absorption and retention of moisture. This material is that artificial stone

called terra-cotta. The compactness of texture which fulfils the purpose in rela-

tion to dryness is also especially favourable for a public edifice in a metropolitan

locality. The microscopic receptacles of soot-particles on the polished surface of

the terra-cotta slabs are reduced to a minimum ; the influence of every shower in

displacing those particles is maximised. I am sanguine in the expectation that the

test of exposure to the London atmosphere during a period equal to that which

Las elapsed since the completion of Barry's richly ornamented palace at West-

minster, now so sadly blackened by soot, will speak loudly in favour of Mr.

Waterhouse's adoption of the material f^or the construction of the National

AMuseum of Natural History.  collateral advantage is the facility to which the

moulded blocks of terra-cotta lend themselves to the kind of ornamentation to

which I have already referred.

     In concluding the above sketch of the development of our actual Museum of
Natural History, I may finally refer, in the terms of our modern phylogenists, to

the traceable evidences of 'ancestral structures.' In the architectural details of

the new Natural History Museum you will find but one character of the primitive
·and now extinct museum retained, viz. the Central Hall. In Montague House

there were no galleries, but side-lit saloons or rooms of varying dimensions and on

different storeys.

    In its successor, the Museum developed on its site at a later period, we find

galleries added : that, for example, which was appropriated to the birds and sliells

being .300 feet in length. This architectural organisation still exists at Bloomsbury.

     The Museum, which may be said to have budded off, has risen to a still higher
grade of structure after settling down at South Kensington. In its anatomy we

tind, it is true, the central hall and long side-lit galleries; but in addition to these

inherited structures we discern a series of one-storeyed galleries, manifesting a

developmental advance in the better admis.^ion of light and a consequent adapta-

tion of the walls as well as the floor to the needs of exhibition.'

     ' In the notable reply {Annales des Sciences Xaturelleg, 1820) to an illustration

of the unitj' of composition or of plan in Cejabalopods and Vertebrates, by bending

one of the latter so as to bring the pelvis in contact with the nape, advocated by

     Should the Section, as did the Acnd^mie des Sciences in relation to the passage
cited, kindly condone such application to human contrivances of the current
genealogical or phylogenetic language applied to vital structures, your President
need hardly own his appreciation of^the vast superiority of every step in advance

which is manifested in existing as compared with extinct organisms. And thus,
pensible, as far as the human faculty may comprehend them, that organic adapta-
tions transcend the best of those conceived by the ingenuity of man to fulfil his

special needs, he would ask whether analogy does not legitimately lead to the

iuference, for organic phenomena, of an Adapting Cause operating in a correspond-

ing transcendent degree ?                                 _ "~j*'

In conclusion, I am moved to remark that a Museum giving space and light for

adequate display of the national treasures of Natural History may be expected to

exert such influence on the progress of Biology as to condone, if not call for,

a narrative of the circumstances attending its formation in the Records of the

     The following Papers were read ;

       1. Jurassic Birds and their Allies. By Professor 0. C. Maksh.

     The author ha-sdng been engaged for several years in investigating American

Mesozoic Birds, found it important to study the European forms. He had therefore

examined with some care the three known specimens of Ai'chisopten/.v, as well as
some allied extinct Reptiles, which promised to throw light upon Birds. During
this investigation he had observed several important characters in Ar-ckceoptert/.v
not pre\'iously determined, and he thought it appropriate to make them known here.
Among the more important of these characters were the following :

     1. The presence of true teeth in position in the skull. These teeth appear to be

in the premaxillary, and in form closely resemble the teeth of Hesperornis. No

teeth are known from the lower jaw, but they were probably present.
     2. The vertebr£e are biconcave. The presacral vertebrae are all, or nearly all,

biconcave, resembling in form those of Ichthyornis. There are about twenty-one
presacral vertebrje, and the number of caudals is nearly or quite the same. The
sacral vertebrte are not more than five, and probably less.

     3. There is a broad, well-ossified sternum. The scapular arch, as a whole,

6tage arranges dans le meme maniere, on dirait aussi que leur ^^Zrtw est la meme.

Mais si leur ordre etait different, si, de plain-pied dans une des maisons, ces pitees

662 EEPOET-- 1881,

strongly resembles that in modern birds. All of the usual elements are present,
and most of them are distinctly a"vian, the furculum especially so.

     4. There are three digits only in the manus, all provided with claws. The
three free metacarpals have the form and position of those in some young modern
birds, and although corresponding to the same bones in reptiles, have the avian
stamp already upon them.

     5. The pelvic bones are separate. In this respect Ai-chceopteryx differs from all
adult birds recent and extinct, and agrees with Dinosaurian reptiles, a point of
much importance. Diagrams illustrating this were shown.

     6. The distal end of the tibula is placed in front of the tibia. This is not known

in any other birds, but is a characteristic of Dinosaurs.
     7. The metatarsal bones are separate, or imperfectly united. This chai-acter

also has not before been observed in any adult birds, modern or ancient, but is seen
in all known Dinosaurs.

     The author also stated that the brain-cast of Arch(eoptery.v resembled that of
Laopteryx, an American Jurassic bird, which he had recently described. The
brains of both appear to have been comparatively larger than in Hesperornis,
which may be due to the fact that they were land birds, while all known cre-
taceous birds were aquatic.

     The author considered the nearest allies to birds to be the Dinosaiu'ian reptiles,

which really constitute a sub-class rather than an order. Among these reptiles,

 Comptognathus is especially bird-like in the extremities, but the vertebrte and
pelvis show important differences from all known birds. In examining the
original specimen of Cvmptoynathus in Mmiich, the author detected in the
abdominal cavity the skeleton of a young reptile, apparently a foetus, but possibly
one that had been swallowed. Nothing of the kind had before been noticed in
Dinosaurs. The presence of a clavicle in this group of reptiles had not hitherto

been determined, but two specimens of Iguanodon in the British Museum show
that this genus possessed these bones, and drawings of one were shown. The

relations of Dinosaurs to early forms of birds the author had discussed iu detail in
his memoir on the Odontornithes, published during the previous year.

2. On the use of the Chitinous Elements or Appendages of the Cheilostoma-
    tous Pohjzoa in the Diagnosis of Species.^ By George Busk, F.R.S.

      Having for some time been engaged in the description of the Polyzoa collected

--on the Challenger Expedition, the author in common, he believes, with all who
--have made that class the subject of study has been greatly perplexed to find satis-

 factory distinctive characters in several of the natural groups composing it. Amongst
 the most difficult and puzzling may be more especially mentioned the generic groups
 comprised under the names of Oellepora, Retepora, and Cellaria or Salicornaria.

      As it is but quite recently that his attention has been directed to the use that
 might be made of the chitinous appendages, in addition to those usually employed,

 derived from the calcareous skeleton, he has not been able at present to extend
 his observations beyond the three genera above mentioned, but he has little doubt

 it will be found extremely useful in many others, more especially among the

  Escharidre,

      His attention was first drawn to the use that might be made of the chitinous

 organs by the perusal of a short paper by Mr. A. W. Waters, in the Transactions

 of the Manchester Philosophical Society, on the use of the operculum as affording

  difierential characters.

      Led by this valuable suggestion to see how far the character of the operculum
 might assist him in the diagnosis of the species of Cellepora on which he was at the
 time engaged, he was at once struck with the great facility that attention to this

 character afibrded in the distinction of otherwise obscure forms of this most
 difficult group.

   --TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 663

     At the same time it appeared to him that it would be additionally advantageous,

besides the characters afforded by the ope}-culu7n, to regard those of the other
chituious organs, and notably those of the avicularia. In some few cases other
chitinous appendages occur, but to these he need not here refer.

     Not to enter into particidars, he would merely remark that, from his examination
of the characters afforded by the chitinous appendages in numerous species of
Cellepora, Salicornaria, and Retepora, he has come to the conclusion that, com-
bining the opercidar with the avicularian characters, these characters alone will,
in nearly aU cases in the genera mentioned, suffice to determine the species, and that

with the greatest facility and certainty. He may also add, as regards the family

Salicomariidse, or Cellariidae as some prefer to term it, this method of examination
has disclosed the existence in that family of special chitinous supports, as they

may be termed, on the sides or around the orifice, apparently for the articulation

of the ope7'culujn, which, so far as he is at present aware, ha^e not been noticed,
and are peculiar to it.

     As this brief notice is merely intended to draw attention to an element in the
anatomy of the Oheilostomatous Polyzoa, not hitherto employed as a means of

diagnosis except by Mr. "\^ aters, he does not on the present occasion enter into
detads, but simply hands round specimens prepared for this method of investiga-

tion, and will conclude by a few words as to the mode in which he has found it may

conveniently be carried out.
     This consists, in fact, simply in the removal of the calcareous matter by means

of dilute nitric or other acid, from a small fragment or portion of a zoarium,
which after decalcification should be torn up or 'teased' out into minute pieces, and
examined, covered with glycerine, or glycerine and gum. It is as well also, before
the decalcified specimen is broken up, to stain it with some colouring matter, of
which he has found picrocarmine perhaps the best.

      In preparations thus made, all the chitinous elements will be found clearly dis-

-- --played, and what is of particular interest nearly all the soft parts as well, and

especially the muscular tissue ; and in many cases the general conformation of the
polypide may be made out almost as well, if not in some instances better, than in

the recent condition.

     The length of time a specimen may have been kept in the dry state, if it were
in good condition to begin with, appears to make no difference in the ease with
which the soft tissues may be thus, as it were, resuscitated.

   We have thus in our power, from a minute fragment of a zoarium little bigger

than a pin's head, to determine its specific and many other characters, in a few
minutes ; and, in the case of the genera above cited, with much greater facility and

exactitude than by the most laborious examination of the calcareous skeleton alone.

     It is much to be regretted that the method is of course only applicable to

recent forms procured originally in the live state, and can afford no assistance in

the case of dead or fossil forms, for the distinction of which we are so lamentably
in want of sufficient means of diasrnosis.

     3. On the Botany of Madagascar} By J. G. Bakek, F.B.S., F.L.S.

     The fauna of Madagascar exhibits remarkable individuality of character. The
island produces many striking- types that are peculiar to it, and on the other
hand, many widely-spread and copiously represented genera which inhabit the
neighbouring continents are absent. The leading facts in connection with the sub-
ject have been fully summarised and illustrated recently by Mr. Wallace in his
' Island Life,' and the whole evidence of the fauna points in the direction of long

 isolation.

     But when we turn to the botany, the general tendency of the facts is in a different
direction, and no attempt has yet been made to summarise them. No special flora

of Madagascar has yet been published, but, taking the species that have been de-

   Order of Thalamiflor^, known in- Mauritius, Madagascar, Continen-

    --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 665

 scribed in general monograplis and scattered papers, and adding to tliem those that

we possess in the London herbaria alone, we have now definite knowledge from

 Madagascar of not less than 2,000 species, wliich the author estimates represent
 700 genera and 125 natural orders. The tiora, as a whole, follows closely the same
 general lines as that of the other tropical countries of the old world. This maj- be
illustrated in various ways. The annexed table gives the number of genera'and
 species of each order in Madagascar as compared with Mauritius, continental
 tropical Africa, and India, apart from the Himalayas, and it will be seen that the
 general parallelism is very close.

     Out of 55 known orders of Thalamiflorae only eight are not here represented but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

of these 47, 37 are already known in Madagascar. Of the ten orders not yet known
in Madagascar, none are known in Mauritius, but two are represented by single
species in the Seychelles. Two of them are confined to Tropical Asia and one to
Tropical Africa, but the other seven are common to both continents.

      One of the most striking and suggestive characters of the flora of the intertropical

zone of tlie world, taken as a whole, is the large extent to which it is everywhere
made up of species representing large genera which are spread through it pretty

evenly. There are many genera containing 300, 400, or 500 species, that are largely

represented in Africa, Asia, and America. Some of these are herbaceous glumi-

ferous monocotyledons, as, for instance, (''yperus with 400 species, and Panicum
with 500. The large genera of ferns, such as Polypodium, Acrostichum, Asplenium,
and Pteris, all fall into this category. Some of them are dicotyledons with sepa-
rated sexes and small inconspicuous "flower-wrappers, such as Ficiis with 400 species,
Piper with GOO, Phyllanthus with 400-500, Croton with 450. But many of these
large cosmopolitan genera are dicotyledons of shrubby or arborescent habit, with
insect-fertilised hermaphrodite flowers, a distinct calyx and corolla, and showy,
scented petals. Loranthus with 300 species, although exclusively parasitical, falls

into this category. So do Psychotria with 500 species, Indigofera with 300-400,

·Vernonia with 400, Solanum with 500, and Eugenia with 500. And a point which

must be prominently taken into account in estimating the general relations of the

flora of Madagascar, is that nearly all these large cosmopolitan genera are now

ascertained to be represented in the island, although often by endemic species.
     The marked tendency to uniformity in character which is shown by the flora of

the whole tropical zone is further illustrated by the fact that a considerable number
of species are spread universally through the old world, and that a considerable
number extend their range to Tropical America. Of the plants of our own colonies
in that part of the world, out of 1,058 flowering plants and vascular Cryptogamia,
370, or about one-third, occur both in Tropical Asia and Continental Africa, and
225 species, or about one in five of the total flora, extend their range to Tropical
America. In Madagascar the absolute number of these widely-spread species is as
great, but of course the proportion which they bear to the total flora is smaller.
Tlie orders most largely represented here are Cyperacese, Gramineff, Compositse,
Leguminospe, and Malvacese.

      In the island flora there are altogether abotit 80 endemic genera, according to
our present knowledge. The order Chlfenacese has been supposed to be peculiar to
Madagascar, but two of the genera have been found in Mozambique. The otlier

genera are many of them monotypic, and very few contain more than tliree or four
species. They are not concentrated in any part of the systematic series, and most
of them belong to tlie large natural order.s, Compositte with nine genera, and Paibia-

cere with eight, taking the lead.

      ^Vith Mauritius, Bourbon, and the Seychelles the affinity of the Madagascar
flora is close. There are several genera and species which occur both in the large
and small islands which are restricted to the group.

     There is a close affinity between the flora of Madagascar and that of Tropical
Africa. In Rubiacere, for instance, there are nine genera otherwise confined to
Tropical Africa whicji reach Madagascar, and in other orders a smaller number,
"We have instances of such genera in Brexia, Dombeya, Acridocarpus, Psorosper-

mum, Myrothamnus, Psiadia, I.andolphia, and Mimulopsis. Instances of striking
species common to both areas are furnished by Haronga madagascarensis, Trachy-
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;-

lolDium Hornemanuianum (the Copal tree), Albizzia fastigiata, and Eriosema

cajanoides.

     There are a few cases of cm-ious affinities between Madagascar and Tropical
Asia. Of the pitcher-plants, which occur in India and are concentrated in the
Malay Archipelago, one species occurs in the Seychelles, and another in Madagascar,
tut they fail to reach Continental Africa. Of the curious genus Tambourissa there
are about a dozen species in the Mascaren Isles, and one in Java, but none else-

where. But when we remember what has been already pointed out, as to the

uniformity of the Hora of the whole tropical zone, it would seem to be unsafe to infer
from these cases that there has been any comparatively recent land-connection be-
tween the Mascaren Islands and Tropical Asia.

    A very curious peculiarity of the Hora of the hill country of Central Madagascar

is the affinity which we may trace with that of the Cape. For instance, the heaths,

of which there are some 500 at the Cape, are represented in Madagascar by about
a dozen species, all endemic^ Instances of characteristic Cape genera which reach
Madagascar are found in Selago, Aristea, Geissorhiza, Chironia, Pachypodium,
Harveya, Dais, Lasiosiphon, Disa, Satyrium, and Mohria. There are also a few
curious cases, as instanced in Viola abyssinica. Geranium simense, Agauria salici-
folia, Caucaiis melanantha, and Antherotoma Naudini, where species are found
nowhere else except in Central Madagascar and the high mountain regions of Central
Africa, such as the Camaroons and Abyssinian Highlands.

4. On the Colours of Spring Floivers. Bij Alfred W. Bennett,

                                  M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S.

     The variation in the predominant colour of our native flora as the spring advances
to summer and autumn is a familiar fact, though the author is not aware that any
attempt has been made to tabulate the phenomena, or to reduce them to a general law.

     The list from which the following statistics are obtained is based (with a very
few corrections) on the time of flowering given in Sir J. D. Hooker's ' Student's

Flora,' the same work being also followed in the limitation of species. Those are

regarded as early spring flowers which begin to blossom not later than April. In

order to prevent the element of error in the average of colour which woidd result

from the inclusion of all wild plants, whether common or rare, all are excluded

from the list which do not bear at least as high a number as 50 in the ' London

Catalogue of British Plants.' For the classification of the colours, the flowers are

arranged under five heads, viz., 1. white;                                                                                            2.  green;      3.  yellow;  4.  red  and pink
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

5. blue and violet ; very slight shades of colour being neglected. Several large

orders in which the flowers are very inconspicuous are entirely passed over, viz.,

the Amentiferae, Juncaceaj, Gramineas, Cyperacete, and Coniferje.

    The analytical table thus prepared shows that out of 64 species of common

«arly spring flowers, 26, or 40-5 per cent., are white ; 9, or 14-1 per cent.,
green ; 13, or 20-3 per cent., yellow ; 5, or 7-8 per cent., red or pink ; and

11, or 17'4 per cent., blue or violet. As compared with summer or autumn flowers,

this list shows a remarkable preponderance of white flowers yellow is also greatly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

in excess, as compared with other periods of the year, while the number of red and

pink flowers is extremely small.

In order to compare the colour of early spring flowers in England with those of

Switzerland, the author has taken the two volumes already published, including 200

species, of Seboth's ' Alpine Plants,' May, instead of April, being regarded as the

latest early spring month. The following are the results. Out of 51 species, 18, or

35-3 per cent., are white                                                                                              1, or 2-0 per  cent., green ;  10, or 19'6 per cent., yellow
                                                                                                                    ;

14, or 27-4 per cent., red or pink ; and 8, or 157 per cent., blue or violet.

      Several points of contrast between these lists will at once suggest themselves,

--especially the smaller proportion of white, and the very much larger proportion

amounting to nearly fourfold--of red and pink flowers, in the second as compared

with the first.

In attempting to reduce these facts to a general law, it must first be borne in
--TEANSACTIONS OP SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.                   --

                                                                        667

mind that tlie two colours white and green stand on a different footing from the

rest, and indicate more correctly an absence of colour. The colour of green petals

is not due to a mixture of blue and yellow pigments, but to the presence of chloro-

phyll and white flowers do not owe their colour to a milk-white fluid, but to the
                                ;

presence of air in the cells of the petals. JSeeing that the bright-colom^ed fluid

pigments are formed only under the influence of a sufficient supply of light and heat,

the large proportion of green and white early spring flowers is easily accoimted for.

With regard to yellow, M. Flahaut states that ' a solid insoluble pigment, the

xanthine of Fremy and Cloez, is, in tlie first place, to be distinguished from all the

soluble colouring matters, blue, yellow, red, and theii" mixtm-es, all of which are

acted on very readily by reagents, and which are usually found only in the

epidermal cells.' This xanthine Fremy states to occur always in ' the form of

clearly defined grains, occasionally in the epidermal, much more often in the deeper-

lying cells, slowly soluble in alcohol and potassa. It is, in all probability, a

Amodification of chlorophyll.'  list of plants, in the petals of which he has

detected this substance, are without exception early-flowering. The colours,

--therefore, which pre-eminently distinguish our summer and autumn flora the reds,
--pinks, blues, and some yellows are due to coloured soluble pigments which require

both a strong light and a high temperature for tlieir production, and Batalin has

.shown this to be especially the case with the red colouring-substance. That the

same species of flower frequently assumes a more intense coloiu- with increasing

altitude in the Alps has been shown by the obserAations of M. Bonnier, who states

that this change is due to an actual increase in the amount of coloiuring matter in

the cells. The difierence between the prevailmg colours of the ordinary spring flora

in England and in Switzerland is probably due to the same cause. Owing partly

to the spring being a month later, partly to the more southern latitude and con-

sequent greater elevation of the sun, partly to the clearer air of a high altitude, the

light which opens the earliest spring flowers is much stronger in Switzerland than

in England, causing the appearance of those brilliant roses and pinks of the Silenes,

Ericas, and Primulas, and blues of the Gentianas and Soldanellas, with which we

have scarcely anything to compare in our spring flora. The most striking feature

of the early spring Swiss flora, in the figures already given, is the very large

ingredient of red and pink. The author believes a more extensive analysis would

show an almost equal preponderance of blue.

          5, On the Gonstavcij of Insects in tlieir Visits to Flmvers.

              By Alfred W. Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S.

This paper contains a record of observations made with the view of serving as

a contribution towards the determination of the question whether insects are alto-

gether indiscriminating in their visits to flowers, or whether on the same journey

they confine themselves exclusively or chiefly to one species. For this purpose

points of observation were chosen where a considerable number of different flowers

grew in profusion and intermixed, so that the insect would have abimdant oppor-

tunity of changing its diet if so disposed. The insects observed were Lepidoptera,

Apidse, and Syrphidae. Their flight was watched, and the flowers recorded on

which they successively settled ; the poUen attached to the body and legs of the

Apidse, and that contained in the abdomen of the Syrphidse, being also examined.

As far as this series of observations goes, no general statement can be made as

to the constancy of insects in visiting the same species of flower during the same
Aflight.
          decided preference for successive visits to the same flower was unques-

tionably shown in many instances, and this is not dependent on the coloiur of the

--flower only. The hive-bee appears to be far the most constant in this respect

often absolutely so other Apidce approaching, but not usually equalling it.

From their strong and rapid flight, and the extremely hairy covering of their ab-

domen and legs, this claSs of insects is probably the most efficient agent in the

dissemination of pollen. The Syrphidse, which also visit flowers in great abun-

dance, are much less constant; but their object is not so much honey as the pollen
     -- ;'

itself, which forms the principal article of their food ; and their hody and legs
heing not nearly so densely clothed with hairs, their share in the carriage of pollen
must he much smaller. The Lepidoptera appear to ravy greatly in their hahits.
As far as can he gathered from the few ohservations made, the ' painted lady
(^Cynthia ca7-dui) and the small tortoise-shell {Vanessa urticce) are verj' constant
while the whites, the hlues, and the hrowns are far more catholic or less discrimi-
native in their tastes. It is open to question, however, whether more than a very

few flowers are dependent on butterflies for their fertilisation. At all events, their

visits to flowers are often only interludes in then* settlement on grass, lea^"es, the

stems of trees, or the hare ground.

    6. On the Mode in which the Seed of Stipa huries itself in the {/round.
                     By Sir John Lubbock, Bart., M.P., F.E.8.

    The author commenced hy pointing out how the structure of seeds served for
purposes of dispersion, accounting thus for the winged seeds of many trees, the
fleshy pulp of fruits, the hooks on many seeds, the sticky surfaces of some, and

the delicate feathery parachutes of others ; and then, after referring in a few words

--to the cases in which plants throw their own seeds as for instance, the Violet,
--Oxalis, Geranium, Broom, and others sometimes as far as twenty feet, he passed

on to the eases in which seeds sow themselves in the gi'ound.
      After mentioning the subterranean clover, the ground-nut, cranesbill, &c., he

exhibited the very curious seed of Stijm pennata, a kind of grass, which was' also
illustrated by a diagram. The whole seed is more than a foot long, and consists of

--four parts firstly, the actual seed, which is about half an inch in length, narrow,

pointed, and provided with short, stifl', reciu'ved hairs. Tlie upper end is prolonged
into a stiff", twisted, corkscrew-like rod, about two inches in length ; then, at an
angle, is a straight piece about |-inch long ; and then a beautiful tapering feathered
awn, nearly an inch in lengtli. Mr. Francis Darwin had suggested that this beau-

tiful seed buries itself by hygroscopic action, as Eoux has shown to be the case

with the cranesbills, the ' corkscrew ' Iwisting and untwisting under the influence
of different degrees of moisture. The author, however, gave reasons lor thinking
that the true, or at any rate, more usual moti-\e power, was the wind, which acting
on the feathery awn, twists the corkscrew round and round, and drives it into the
ground. At any rate, in some cases this is the mode of action, and by means of a
small bottle filled with moss, and a fan, he exhibited the movement to the Section

experimentally.

1, On the Insect Honse in the Gardens of the Zoological Society of Ijondon.
    By P. L. SCLATER, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S., Secretary to the Zoological

      Society of London.

     The author called the attention of the meeting to the important addition that
had been made during the present year to the Collection of li-\-ing animals in the
Gardens of the Zoological Society of London, in the shape of an Insectarium or

house for the exhibition of living insects in all stages of their development.

    He stated that, although of late years many entomologists had been in the

habit of rearing insects in captivity for the purpose of watching their transforma-
tions and obtaining good specimens in each stage of' existence, nothing like a

systematic attempt, so far as he knew, had been made to form a general collection
of living insects for exhibition. As in former days, as regards reptiles and the

lower marine animals, so in tlie present instance as regards its Insectarium, the

--Zoological Society of London seemed to be first in tlie field, and so far as

could be judged from tlie progress already made--to be likely, if not altogetber

successful, to attain mtuiy interesting and instructive results.

     The building used as an Insectarium was constructed of iron and glass on three
sides, AA-ith a brick back to it. The cases containing the insects were arrano-ed on
stands all round the building, and also occupied two tables in the centre. The
cases used for the principal specimens were formed of zinc plates and glass. The
upper part of them was glazed on all four sides, the top being formed oF perforated
zinc, so as to admit the air. The food-plant, or tlie object required for the
suspension of the chrysalis, when that stage of the insect is exhibited, was inserted
into the case through a circular hole in the bottom ; but the glass front also
opened, so that ready access was obtainable to the interior. The larger cases in
the front row measured about 24 inches in breadth by 18 in depth, and were
32 inches in height. The cases in the opposite row were of similar construction,

but rather smaller in dimensions.

2. On the Birds which have hred in the Barnsley and South Yorlcshire

                              District. Bij Thomas Listek.

The district of the author's ohservations is that part of the county of York called

the South Yorkshire coal-formation, chiefly between the Calder on the north, and

the Don, west and south, with the Dearne, its tributary, flowing through the

middle region by Barnsley, the central point of observation. The country extends,

in a series of well-wooded undulations, from the magnesian limestone on the east

at about 300 feet elevation, to the millstone grit, from 1,000 to 1,700 feet, which

it attains at Black Tor, north-west of ShelHeld. The birds may be said to be

characteristic of the varied districts, from the sub-alpine regions west (the Pennine

rano-e, or great backbone of England, where the moorland birds predominate), the

woodland and cultivated grounds in the centre, frequented by our resident song-

birds and migratory warblers, to the lower tracts beyond the magnesian limestone

in the south-east of the Riding, where birds of the marsh and tidal rivers mingle

with the inland birds. In this paper there is not space to give dates, places, and

authorities, except in some remarkable or recent instances. He believes additions

could be made to the list of birds breeding in the district, by observation or

enquiries respecting the moorland and marsh regions. One main object the author

has always kept in view is, to show what birds have been known in past times,

what have been lost to modern observers, aud what we might still possess, to gratify

the field-naturalist, if means were taken by public Acts, by protection societies

--which have done good as far as they have gone and by proprietors like the late

Charles Waterton and the owner of Wentworth Castle, F. V. T. Wentworth, Esq.,

and other landowners, to encourage the preservation of our lessening rare bu-ds.

In the list appended to the longer article it will be seen that there are a few

birds extinct, or nearly so, in South Yorkshire. The only one which is quite lost

-- --to us the kite he is justified in introducing here. Its nest and yoimg were taken

by bis elder brother in his school-days ; it is also recorded by the late Dr. Farrar in

the same woods, two miles from Barnsley. The author quoted from his list,

written in 1844, in his paper on the birds of the West Riding, delivered at the

British Association meeting at Bradford, inserted in its ' Transactions ' for 1873.

Dr. Farrar records also the peregrine falcon in the same woods and at Walton,

The veteran Waterton complained to him then, and since to the author, of the

gi-adual disappearance of these and other members of the falcon family from the

grand lake and woods of Walton.

The list of birds breeding in this part of Y''orkshire is of course much fewer

than that of birds which have occurred. To give a brief resume we may divide

them, as is sometimes done, into land and water birds. Of the former there

are 92 : 11 raptorial or birds of prey ; 73 insessorial or perching and climbing

birds; 8 rasores or scratchers. Of water-birds there are 21, of which 13 are

waders and 8 swimmers, making 92 in aU. The most rare of these are the green-

shank,  of which only  a  few instances  of  nesting  are  recorded                                      the  red-backed
                                                                                                      ;

shrike, of which the old and young were snared by Dr. Farrar in Clifi'wood, one

mile from Barnsley, in 1829 ; the reed-warbler at Walton HaU, Hemsworth Dam,

Thome Moor, &c., the stone-chat on Brierley Common, and towards the moors

westward ; the woodlark, a few surviving in the south of the county ; the mealy

redpoll, the dunlin, the marsh, and Montague's harrier (occasionally occurring

about Thome, Doncaster, Shefiield) ; the gi-een woodpecker, wryneck, lesser spotted

woodpecker, turtle-dove. The pied flycatcher occurs locally at Wentworth Castle,

Cannon Hall, and WharncliflPe woods. These are sufficient to indicate that some

rare birds may yet be found.

3. On the Foot of Birds, and on the Use of the Serrated Claw} By Philip
                                          M. C. Kermode.

    As regards the serration, the following characters appear to be constant. It is

on the middle toe of each foot, which is longer than the other toes ; the serration is

that of an edge on tlie inner margin of the claw, heing in the horny sheath, but not

appearing in the bone ; it is on a plane with the upper or concave surface of, and

projecting at right angles to the inner side of the claw, the teeth being directed

forwards  and  slightly curved towards      their  points                                           it  is not found on the claw of

young birds, but grows with the growth of the bird.

    Possessed of this peculiarity we find representatives of the following families :

1. Strigidm (Swainson mentions StrixJlanunea, but the author has not detected it)                                 ;

2.  Caprimulgidce ; 3.  Charadriidce ;  4.  Ardeida                                             6.  PelecanidtB.
                                                                                             ;

    That it is not caused by ' wear and tear ' is evidenced by the constancy of its

position, and the regularity, size, and shape of the teeth.

    It cannot serve the bird in seizing or retaining its prey, nor yet in retaining its

perch (unless, possibly, with the Caprimulgidce, which perch along a branch, having

one foot placed before the other).

    Possibly the birds possessed of this form may, from food or habit, be more

subject to parasites, or these be of a peculiar nature. Whether this be so or not, the
proper function of this peculiar form of claw is evidently to cleanse and preen the

plumage, and, with the Capinmulgidce, to keep clean the vibrissas.

                         MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.

     The following Papers and Report were read :

1. On the Anatomy and Glassification of the Petrels, based upon those col'

 leded hj H.M.S. ' Challenger.' Btj W. A. Forbes, II,A., F.L.S., F.Z.S.

    After stating the reasons why hitherto the anatomy of this group of birds
had been hardly at all studied, the author, who has been enabled, thanks mainly to

the specimens collected by the Challenge!-, and entrusted to him for anatomical
examination by Sir WyvUle Thomson, to dissect nearly all the chief genera of this
group, proceeded to give an account of the results as yet arrived at.

     After describing briefly some of the more remarkable peculiarities of structure

of the group of Petrels or Tubinares, of which about 150 species are now known,

the author proceeded to consider the questions of their classification and affinities.
The Tubinares form a very well-defined group, separated off from all other birds by
a combination of characters external and internal, not found elsewhere, as well as

by some peculiar to the group itself. Two well-marked families now exist : one, the

Oceanic Petrels ( OceanitidcB) represented by four genera, and about eight species
the other {Procellariidcs) containing all the remainder of the group, and being
divisible again into three sul>families, the Albatrosses {Diomedeince), the Diving
Petrels (PelecanoidincB), and the true Petrels {Procellariin<s) , this last division con-
tainuig by far the greater number of the genera and species.

     As regards the affinities of the group, the author was of the opinion that the
Petrels are probably much modified descendants of some ancient form, which was
related to the Ciconiiform birds of Garrod, i.e. the storks, American vultures,
Accipitres, Steganopodes, and their allies. Any relationship to the gulls {Laridce)
was not borne out by the anatomy of the two groups in question.

k         2, On some Permajiient Larval Forms among the Crinoidea.
                          By P. Herbert Carpenter, M.A.

     Since the discovery of the pentacrinoid stage in the development of the feather-
star, the stalked Crinoids have been universally regarded as occupying the position
of permanent larval forms with respect to the Cotnatnla ; and the discovery of types
like Shizocrinus and Hyocrinus, in which the oral plates are more or less com-
                                                                                                                                   ;

pletely retained tlirougli life, has confirmed and extended this view. In these recent

forms the oral plates separate from one another, as they do in the later stages of
the pentacrinoid larva of the feather-star, and the peristome is laid open to the

exterior. But in many Palseocrinoids the peristome was covered in throughout
life either hy a pyramid of oral plates, or by a ' vault ' of greater or less com-

plexity.
-- --De Loriol has recently described a small Jurassic Orm. oi.d1
                                                                               ,. . .

                                                                  Thiolbericnnus in

which  the  top stem joint enlarges  and  bears cirrhi, just  as  in  Comc.tida                                               but  it
                                                                                                                           ;

retains its connection with the stem below it, instead of becoming free, and_ the

basals do not entirely disappear from tlie exterior of the calyx. Thiollicricrinus,

therefore, is permanently in the condition of a tolerably advanced pentacrinoid

larva of the feather-star.

    Among the Comatulce dredged by the Challe^iger and by the United States
Coast SuiTey are three species of a new genus which the author proposes to call
Atcleerinus. Two species were obtained in the Caribbean Sea, and the third in

the South Pacific. The distinctive characters of the genus are (1) the persistence
of the embryonic basals, which do not undergo metamorphosis into a rosette, but
remain as a closed circlet, entirely separating the radials fromthe centro-dorsal
(2) the absence of pinnules from about the first eleven arm-joints. With the
e.xception of the doubtful genus Comaster, no recent Comatida yet known retains

its embryonic basals on the exterior of the calyx, after the latter part of its exist-

ence as a ' Pentacrinoid ; ' while there is no Comatida hitherto lmo\^Ti, eitlier
recent or fossil, in which the basal circlet is complete, as it is in some Pentacrinus

species, and in the earlier stages of the Pentacrinoid. As regards the characters
of its calyx, therefore, Atelecrinm may be considered as a permanent larval form.

Tiie absence of pimiules from the basal portions of the arms pomts to the same
conclusion. The author has met with five Co?««<M/rt-species which agree with

AnL rosacea in not developing pinnules upon the lower arm-joints until after the

 appearance of cirrhi upon the centro-dorsal and its liberation from the rest of the

lar^al stem ; but Atelecrinus appears to be permanently in this condition. It ex-

 hibits no traces, however, of persistent oral plates.

   3. Note on the British Comatute. By P. Herbert Carpenter, M.A.

     Some vears a^o Barrett dredged a Comatula on the coast of Skye, to which he
wave the specific name celtica. His specimens were lost for a time, and though
others were obtained from the same locality by H.M.S. Forcupine, there has been
a little uncertainty, especially among Continental zoologists, as to the true cha-

racters of the species. Pvecently, however, one of Barrett's original specimens has
}ieen discovered at the British Museum, and it turns out to be identical, as do the
Porcupine specimens, with the rare Antedon phalangium of the Mediterranean.

This species, however, is not known to occur at any intermediate localities betwei'U
Skye and tlie Mediterranean. Neither lias it been obtained further north than
the Faroe Channel. The Antedon celtica, described by Von Marenzeller and

Sladen from the Arctic Ocean, is an entirely ditterent species, and is the one to
which this name will have to be applied in future; Miiller's name, ;;//r/to?r/ /«/;;,

and Ant. Sarsii, which has been obtained in the Shetlands, there are, perhaps,

two other Comatulce which are known on our coasts. One is the common Ant.

 rosacea which is universally distributed, and · the other la Ant. Midleri, vih\c\\ is

distinguished fnmi Ant. rosacea, according to Sir Wyvilh Thomson, by the greater

 leno-th of the ovaries, and a ditferencc' in the relative proportions of tlie lower
 pinnules. This type has been obtained at Arran, Oban, Belfast, and elsewhere,

 and it is the one which seems to be the most common in the Jlediterranean.

 Whetlier, however, it is really distinct from Ant. rosacea is a point for further

 investigation.

4. On the Affinities of Proneomenia} By Dr. A. A. W. Hubrecht.

One of the forms of animal life which have heen looked upon as aberrant by

successive investigators of moilusks and collectors of shells is the genus Chiton,

with its allies, Chitonellus, Cryptochiton, &c. Instead of a regular bivalve or

iinivalve shell these animals carried along the median line of tlieir backs a series

of calcareous plates, forming, on closer inspection, so manj- separate shells, the one

behind the other.

By the possession of a radida, they appeared closely allied to tlie other Odon-

tophora                                by a  certain  amount  of bilateral symmetry they seemed  to  resemble  the
                                    ;

lameUibranchiates.

Very recently certain points in then- internal organisation, more especially con-

cerning the nervous system, gave rise to their being entirely removed (wrongly I
think) by a German morphologist from tlie Mollusks and placed in the sub-division
of Worms.

Of late years otlier, yet more perplexing, forms liave come to liglit. One of

them, discovered by Professor Loven, of Stockholm, appeared to be a very small-

sized worm, and was, up to the last two or three years, arranged with the Gephy-

reans, and called Chcetoderma. Its anatomy was first investigated by Professor

von Graff, and more completely in 1877 by l)r. Hansen.

     The second genus to which I allude was first described by TuUberg, in 1875,
found off the Swedish and Norwegian coast, and lately proved, by the Rev. A. M-
Norman, also to inhabit the British coasts. To it the name of Neomenia was

assigned.

     Opinions differed as to its ueai'est allies. Some placed it with the worms,
others with the mollusks. Von Graff pointed out its close relationship to Chsetoderma,

whereas the distinguished British morphologist, Professor Ray Lankester, created
a separate phylum for it, which he placed in the immediate vicinity of the Chitons.

    Von Thering was the first to propose that the Chitons, Chretoderma, and

Neomenia should all be united in a separate class, which he called the class of the

Amphineura.

The year before last the Dutch expedition which, in the vessel Willcm Bm-^f.s,

yearly sets out for explorations of the Arctic seas, brought .with it two specimens

of an animal, which not only proved this arrangement to be a very natural one,
but also by its minute anatomy actually furnishes several links by which the

disconnected genera above mentioned are held together.

    The specimens were placed in my hands, and, in working them out, I was
more fortunate than several of my feUow-workers in this one respect, that my

results were not forestalled by the publication of an English report on the same
subject which appeared last year, and in which some of the most eminent of
your specialists described the different marine animals brought home by the Dutch

exploring vessel from a collection of specimens which had found theii-'way to the

Exeter Museum

     The comparative study was unexpectedly facilitated by the kind generosity with
which Professor Ray Lankester, who had made an excellent series of sections

through the specimens of Neomenia collected by Mr. Norman, put these sections

at my disposal, although his intention in preparing them had been to work up

the subject himself.

    I may now call your attention to those facts by which either the affinity of
the different genera of the Amphineura is demonstrated, or even in some cases

light appears to be thrown on the phylogeny of the MoUusca in general.

     The external shape is very simple, in wliich respect it corresponds with Neo-
menia and Chsetoderma ; in size, however, it considerably surpas,ses them, measur-

ing about 15centim. ; the body is rounded, shows no external appendages whatever,

whereas ventrally a very fine groove is perceptible, in front and behind of which
the anterior and posterior openings leading into the animal's intestines are situated.

674 REPORT-- 1881.

Inside the fine groove, wliich in life can, no doubt, he opened and expanded, a
longitudinal ridge is situated, which is coated witli cilia, protrusible in its tiu'n,
and most probably the homologue of the foot in otlier Mollusca.

    On touching the exterior surface of tlie animal it feels rough and stiff; this is

caused by innumerable small spiculse in its integument, which are intermixed, in
a more or less regular arrangement, and several layers of which are superposed one
upon the other. They are calcareous, supported by and formed in a sort of cellular
cup surrounding the base, which remains in communication with the deeper cellular
layers of the integument. Between them a homogeneous chitin-like substance is
present, holding them in their places.

    Similar structures may be noticed in the. integument of Chiton on the sloping

sides of tlie mantle laterally with the dorsal plates, and these structm-es are, perhaps,
more marked in young than they are in older stages.

     In Chitonellus, where the dorsal plates are considerably reduced, tliey were

found in a much greater number by a German searcher, several years ago. Similar
calcareous spicules, differently arranged and shaped, however, are present in Chseto-
derma and Neomenia.

     With reference to the digestive canal, which is wholly symmetrical, I Lave little to

remark. It is internally provided with deep folds, and part of it is strongly ciliated,
in both respects closely resembling Neomenia. Neither coidd a separate liver be
detected, special secreting cells in the walls of the intestine apparently supplementing
the functions of this organ. Internally the mouth is surrounded by circular or semi-
circidar folds of the pharyngeal epithelium ; one of these is provided with numerous
nerve -branches running towards it, and must be looked upon as a sort of circular
lip. Over the muscidar buccal mass a curious blind prolongation of the posterior

thin-walled portion of the intestine takes its coiu-se ; this terminates anteriorly

in- the head. Posteriorly on the floor of the buccal mass a small slit-like opening
is found, leading into a median cavity containing the radida and into two lateral
tubes, the salivary glands. As Neomenia is entirely deprived of a radula, and was
for this reason removed from the MoUusks, it is important to notice that its close
ally, Proneomenia, is possessed of one. It is also a very suggestive fact that the radula
of this latter form, though perfect and complicated in shape, is so extremely

diminished in size thatjt may be said to be degenerate and on its way to be lost,

a stage which has been reached in Neomenia. For this reason the apparently less

diflerentiated Neomenia may not be looked upon as the more primitive ; the im-

portant ancestral character which it has lost is, however, retained in its ally, and
this induced me to choose the name of Proneomenia for the latter.

      In passing on to the nervous sj-stem, always so important in classification,
a general remark may be made respecting a more primitive characteristic of the
 uei-ve-tissue of this animal. Although both ganglia and nerve-stems are present,
.still the latter are everywhere accompanied by nerve-cells, which in the ganglia
 are more numerous.

     The brain is situated close to the front termination of the body, and three
principal pairs of nerves originate from it, one pair forming the sublingual ring, the
others being continued in the longitudinal pedal and longitudinal lateral stems. The
two pedal nerves are united by transverse commissures, such as were noted for
Chiton and Neomenia. In Chiton this was inadequately intei-preted as an approach
to what is called in German the StricMeiterne7-ven-system of segmented invertebrates.
Traces of it were found in such lower Mollusks as Haliotis and Fissurella ; its
increased complication in the Amphinem-a nevertheless shows it to be of importance
in determining the phylogenetic affinities of these animals. Moreover Proneomenia
in another important character shows a greater complication, viz. ia the presence
of a system of transverse commissures between the lateral and the pedal stems. As
numerous finer branches spring from these transverse commissures, as well as from the
longitudinal stems, a gradual approach is here noticeable towards that form of nenous
>iystem which has been described by Lang for marine flatworms, in which a dendritic
and general anastomose of commissures in the most different directions is present,
and further on to a still more primitive stage, in which even the meshes between
this network of nervous tissue are filled up, and in which a continuous plexus of
        TRANSACTIONS OB' SKCXION D. DKPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 675

nervous tissue pervades tlirougliout the body, as some time ago it was found to
exist in Actinirc and in certain Nemerteans.

     Lastly, another not uuimportant fact may be noticed : viz. that here the three

principal paii-s of nerves separately originate from the brain, which is not the case
in the other Amphineiira.

     The organs of reproduction and of excretion of Proneomenia are in many respects

highly suggestive.

     The hermaphrodite gland is situated all dlong the back of the animal ; it is very
symmetrical and intrinsically double. The generative products are carried by two
ciliated canals, which are tlie direct continuation of the double gland, into a cavity,
the pericardium. This pericardium in Mollusks is the representative of the body-
cavity : in Ch^toderma and Neomenia it equally serves as a receptacle for the eggs.
Inside this cavity in all the three genera the heart is situated, and caused the "ill-
chosen name of pericardium to be given to this reduced portion of the body-cavity.

      Another set of ciliated ducts leads the genital products out of the pericardium

Atowards the exterior. They are of different diameter and make a double bend.

     paired additional gland which is ramified opens out into them. The terminal
thicker portion of the ducts leading outwards has a high epithelium in which
spherical secretions take their origin. It is marked off by a muscular constriction
from the parts preceding it, and must, as it appears to me, be looked upon as the
renal organ, the kidney, of the animal. Both halves of it coalesce and then open to

the exterior.

      In this direct and serial continuity between the three cavities (a) of the genital

gland, (6) of the pericardium, and (e) of the kidney or nephridium, I believe we have

an important fact before us for the comparative morphology of the Mollusks. Now

we must bear in mind (1) that in the greater number of Mollusks a communication

between the renal organ and the pericardium {i.e. between the nephridium and the
body-cavity) persists. Secondly, that the genital products, which are generally
carried outwards independently, are, on the contrary, evacuated into the cavity of
the kidney in such more primitive Mollusks as Dentalium, Fissurella, Patella, and

Spondylus. To me it appears that even this is only a secondary stage, and that the

primitive one was that in which the genital products, being discharged into the body-
cavity, were from thence con\-eyed outwards by the ciliated nephridium.

      This is, in fact, the arrangement as it still obtains in Proneomenia, and which is
most likely to be found in Chsetoderma and Neomenia as well.

     I will only add that the anatomical details, which we have just passed under
review, were none of them studied by direct macroscopic preparation. With
specimens of this rarity it seemed preferable to cut them iip into series of sections
which could all of them be preserved, afterwards reconstructing the original shape
by mental combination of the sections. This permits of aU the anatomical statements
being submitted to revision or criticism at any time, by the aid of the original

preparations.

       6. On some Points in the Development o/Osmunda regalis (Linn.).
                             By Chas, p. Hoekirk, F.L.S.

     The object of this paper was to draw attention to the fact that Osmunda re-
fjalis requires six years to attain its normal development into the perfect spore-
bearing plant. The author showed dried specimens of the various stages of this
development, describing their details, and showing how each year produced a plant

gradually approaching towards the perfect form, and also exhibited a six-year-old

growing plant, producing spores for the first time. He also exhibited a portion of
a barren frond, in which some of the terminal pinnae were much constricted in

their development, and bearing spore-cases or thecre on their margins.

      The following Papers and Eeports were read :

          1. On the Sense of Colour among some of the Lower Animals.
                       Bij Sir John Lubbock, Bart., M.P., F.B.S.

     The author began hy recording some elaborate experiments made on a species of
 Daphnia, a small freshwater crustacean, with the spectrum. The general result
was that, in opposition to the opinion of M. Paul Bert, while their limits of vision at
the red end are approximately the same as ours, at the violet end they perceive
light which produces no impression on our eyes.

     He then proceeded to explain some experhnents he had made with bees, in order

to determine whether, and if so how, they are affected by different colours.
     The consideration of the causes which have led to the structure and colouring

of flowers is, he said, one of the most fascinating parts of natural history. Most

botanists are now agreed that insects, especially bees, have played a very important

part in the development of flowers.

     While in many plants, almost invariably with inconspicuous blossoms, the pollen

is carried from flower to flower by the wind, in the case of almost all large and
brightly coloured flowers this is effected by the agency of insects. In such flowers
the colours, scent, and honey serve to attract insects, while the size and form are
arranged in such a manner that the insects fertilise them with pollen brought from
another plant.

     Nevertheless these views have not escaped criticism. M. Bonnier, for instance,
has attempted to show that they are in many respects untenable.

     The author does not propose on the present occasion to follow his general argu-
ment, but merely that portion of it relating to colour.

    In order to test whether and how bees are afi'ected by different colours, he tried
the following experiment. He took slips of glass of the size generally used for slides
for the microscope, viz. 3 inches by 1, and pasted on them .slips of paper colom-ed
respectively blue, green, orange, red, white, and yellow. He then put them on a
lawn in a row about a foot apart, and on each put a second slip of glass with a
drop of honey. He also put with them a slip of plain glass with a similar drop of
honey. He had previously trained a bee to come to the spot for honey. His plan
then was, when the bee returned and had sipped about a quarter of a minute, to
remove the honey, when she flew to another slip. This then he took away, when
she went to a third, and so on. In this way he induced her to visit all the drops of

honey successively. "\Mien she had returned to the nest, he transposed all the upper
glasses with the honey, and also moved the coloured glasses. Thus, as the drop of
honey was changed each time and also the position of the glasses, neither of these
coidd influence the selection by the bee.

     In recording the results he marked down successively the order in which the bee
went to the different coloured glasses. For instance, in the first journey from the
nest, the bee lit first on the blue, which accordingly he marked 1 ; when disturbed
from the blue, she flew about a little and then lit on the white ; when the white
was removed, she settled on the green ; and so successively on the orange, yellow,

plain, and red. He repeated the experiment 100 times ; using two different hives,

and spreading the observations over some time, so as to experiment with diflerent
bees, and under varied circumstances.

     The precautions taken seem to him to have placed the different colours on an
equal footing ; while the number of experiments appears sufficient to give a fair

average.

      He may observe also that the different series agree well among themselves.

The difference between the numbers is certainly striking. Adding together 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, and 7 we get 28 as the total number given bj^ each journey : 100 journeys,
therefore, give, as the tablp shows, a total of 2,800, which divided by 7, would of
course, if no preference were shown, give 400 for each colom-. The numbers, how-
                                                                                              --;

ever, are, for the Wiie, only 275 ; for the white, 349 yellow, 405 ; red, 413 green,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;;

427                    orange, 440 ;            and plain glass as many as              491.
                    ;

A second mode of testing the result is to take the percentage in which the bees

went respectively to each colour, first, second, third, and so on The result is shown

in another table. The result was that out of a hundred rounds the bees took blue

as one of the first three in 74 cases, and one of the last four only in 26 cases

while, on the contrary, they selected the plain as one of the first three only in 25

cases, and one of the last four in 75 cases.

On the whole, then, it seems clear that bees are affected by colour, and that

their favourite colour is blue.

The author ended by some remarlcs on the compavative paucity of blue flowers,

and expressed tlie opinion that almost all, if not all, blue flowers had once been

yellow or white.

4. On our present Knowledge of the Fauna inhahiting British India and its
               Bependencies. By W. T. Blanford, F.R.S.

The author called attention to the need for works on the geology, botany, and

zoology of British India and its dependencies, especially as regards the second and

third. These are needed, not only for students at home, but for purposes of instruc-

tion in the Indian Colleges ; for if the fauna of India is ever to be thoroughly known,

this result can only be obtained by enlisting the services of a large body of

observers                                       and it is in  every way desirable that  many of these observers  should be
                                             ;

natives of the country. But at present the difficulties in tlie way of nati^-es becom-

ing acquainted with the animals of India are almost insuperable, and the ignorance

that prevails is what might be expected.

    Judging from past experience, we may wait an indefinite period before the

necessary series of hand-books will be brought out by private enterprise unassisted

by Government support.

    Up to the present time, Excluding books relating only to Ceylon or to isolated

parts of the British possessions in India, only six works have been published that

can be considered useful text-books fur the determination of the Indian faima.

These books, with their size and date of publication, are the following :

Giinther's * Eeptiles of British India,' 1 vol. large 4to, 1864,

Jerdon's 'Birds of India,' 3 vols, large 8vo, 1862-64.

.Tei-don's ' Mammals of India,' 1 vol. large 8vo. 1867.

Ilanley and Theobald's ' Conchologia Indica ' (plates of land and freshwater

shells only), I vol. 4to, 1870-76.

Theobald's 'Reptiles of British India,' 1 vol. large 8vo, 1876.

Day's ' Fishes of India,' 1 vol. text, 1 vol. plates, 4to, 1875-78.

With the exception of the last-named, all of these works are now inadequate,

<?ither on account of the large additions that have been made to the subjects since

they were published, or from original want of completeness.

    The most successful and, in many respects, the best of the text-books named is

Jerdon's ' Birds of India ; ' and it is not too much to say that since the appearance

of that work, and, to a very great extent, in consequence of its publication, the

knowledge of the subject has been quadrupled, and the number of observers and

students has increased in even a larger proportion.

From experience it appears that the books most required are works very similar
--678 EEPORT 1881,

to those of Jerdon abeady quoted. There is no occasion for very detailed disserta-

tions on habits, distribution, &c., althouf^h a condensed account is necessary,
together with sufficient references to enable a student to consult other works on

the subject. Of each species a brief synonymy with the more important references,

a concise description, and a sufficient account of variation, habits, and distribution

should be given, enough to enable a fairly intelligent obser^-er to identify each

species and to learn the principal facts in its history, and to assist those who wish

for further information in consulting the literature of the subject. Synopses or

keys for the determination of families, genera, and species are desirable, and illus-

trations of structiu'e and occasionally of whole animals would be very important

additions. The best illustrations would perhaps be furnished by woodcuts in the

text. The best size for volumes is from 400 to 600 pages. Books are far better

printed in England, and quite as cheaply as in India, whilst all illustrations are

much better and more cheaply executed in the former country.
    It is very difficult to ascertain what is the number of Invertebrata known to

occur in India. The vertebrate species can be enumerated with a nearer approach

to accuracy. No attempt has been made to determme the marine Invertebrata.

Taking the ' red line ' as a limit, and including protected and tributary States such

as Baluchistan, Cashmere and its dependencies, and Nepaul, and adding Ceylon,

the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the following is an approximation to the

number of species hitherto described in the various classes and orders named, only

Aterrestrial and fluviatilo Invertebrata being included.  considerable amovmt of

time has been devoted to these lists, but it is to be feared tliat, in the case of the

Invertebrata, they are very imperfect. Those marked with a note of interrogation

are, indeed, little more than guesses.
        TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 670

                                                        Vermes.

     Only aljout 14 species appear to be recorded ; these are Plauarlans, earthworms,
and leeches.

    A list like the above scarcely needs comment. To suppose that in a country

from which between 4,000 and 6,000 species of Lepidoptera have been described
there are not 1,000 Hymenoptera, less than 5,000 Coleoptera, and, above all, scarcely
more than 100 spiders, is absurd. It is evident that our knowledge of the Inverte-
brates of India is of the most rudimentary and imperfect description.

5. On a Fossil Stem from the Halifax Coal-measures. By Thomas Hick,

                          J5.il., B.Sc, and William Cash, F.G.S.

     The stem described is one that has been obtained by Mr. James Binns from
the Lower Coal-measures of Halifax, Yorkshire. Though somewhat flattened on
one side and imperfect on the other, it is s^iliiciently well-preserved to indicate
that it was originally cylindrical in its general form. It consists of a central pith,
surrounded by a number of slightly wedge-shaped masses of vascular or fibro-
vascular tissue. Outside these masses of tissue, or bundles as they may be called,
is a cambium zone, followed by a comparatively thick cortex. Its whole diameter

is "147 of an inch.
     T/ie ^jiY/t has a parenchymatous structiu'e quite similar to that met with iu

recent herbaceous stems and in the youngest shoots of woody perennials.
     T/ie vasculai- tissue surrounds the pith in a narrow zone, and iu the transverse

section bears a remarkable resemblance to the Xylem portions of the fibro-vascular

bundles of dicotyledons during the hrst season of growth. It is composed chiefly
of vessels of the barred and dotted tj-pes.

     The pith and vascidar tissue combnied form a central cylindrical axis to the
stem, which has a diameter of '056 of an inch.

     The cambium layer lies outside the vascular zone, and consists of delicate thin-
v.-alled cells, which again remind us of young dicotyledonous stems and branchlets.
It is not, however, separated from the cortex by the interposition of any ele-
ments having the appearance of phloem.

      The cortex is the most characteristic portion of the stem, and differs from any-
thing previously met with in the stems of fossil plants. It is of considerable
thickness compared with the diameter of the central axis, and is, apparently,
entirely cellular. In the middle portion there is a series of large air-spaces, which
run through the stem in a longitudinal direction, and which are destitute of tissue
of any kiud. These are separated from one another by thin plates of tissue, one
cell thick, which run in a radial direction from the central axis to the periphery.
In the possession of these air-spaces, and the histological structure of the paren-

chyma that separates them, the fossil agrees very closely with sucli well-known
aquatic genera as Myiiophyllum, Hippuris, Hottonia, Potamogeton. With tlie

stem of Myriophyllum, indeed, it is almost identical, the radiating plates of paren-
chyma met with iu the cortex, exhibiting the same arrangement in both cases, and
being destitute of the numerous anastomoses which are met with in the other
genera. The chief difference between them is in the vascular axis. In the fossil,
this shows the distinction of pith and vascular bundles above-mentioned, but
exhibits no trace of a fibro-vascular bundle-sheath. In Myriophyllum the axis is
composed of a thin-walled cambiform tissue, intermixed with which, in a more ov
less irregular manner, are a few spiral vessels, and the whole is enclosed in a well-
detined tibro-vascular bundle-sheath. Though attaching great weight to these
differences, the authors do not regard them as absolutely decisive against the
affinity of the fossil plant with Myriophylluin. They consider it probable that
Mynophyllum and the other genera referred to are tlie existing representatives of
plants that were formerly more abundant, and whose tissues were more highly
680 EEPORT-- 1881.

difterentiated, and which therefore might have had a vascular axis of the character
seen in the fossil under description.

    They propose to designate their specimen MyriophyUoides Williamsoni, in

honour of Professor W. 0. Williamson, F.R.S.

      By Lieut.- General Sir James E, Alexander, Knt., C.B., F.R.S.E.

     Endeavours have been made for several years to induce attention to he directed
to the pollution of rivers in Scotland, and the loss of valuhle breeding-grounds for
salmon. The Duke of Buccleugh, the Marquis of Lothian, Sir Robert Christison,
;Mr. INIilue Home, and others co-operated, and the Scotch Fisheries Improvement
Association was instituted. Owing to the extensive manufactures it is difficult to
prevent the pollution of streams. Settling and filtering ponds should be estab-
lished, svich as there are at Blanefield "^^''orks, at Hawick, &c. Bad state of the
Devon from impurities. Mr. Young, Commissioner of Scotch Salmon Fisheries, re-
commended a close time, the removal of obstructions in rivers, fixed engines in river-
mouths and estuaries, reformation of district boards, and the prevention of poaching.
Mr. Frank Bucklaud alluded to the confusing salmon legislation, and recom-
mended a single Act. Stake nets should be abolished near the mouths of rivers.
The author describes how the salmon are intercepted on the caulds or weirs of the

Tweed. He approves of tlie mode of keeping the Teith clear at the Deanstone

works, no sewage being allowed to enter the river. Old fishers state that salmon

live on their own substance ia fresh water ; this is disputed. The paper notices
Sir James Maitland, a great hatcher, and the fungoid disease in the Tweed.

9. On some Vestiges of the Ancient Forest of imrt of the Pennine Chain}
                                    By Joseph Lucas.

     Nidderdale and its moors have formerly been covered by an extensive forest.

Many trees lie buried in the peat upon the moors, but the birch appears almost

everywhere predominant. Hazel, sealh (willow), thorn, oaks, &c., also occur, but at

a certain elevation above 1,000 feet the birch must have formed an almost universal

forest by itself, such as may be seen on the west coast of Norway at the present

day.

    The upper parts of the Moorland Gills, and much of what is now the moors,

must formerly have made a beautiful appearance, with its light gauze-like forest of

birch and mountain-ash. The last surviving example on any considerable scale is

preserved in Birk Gill, a tributary of the river Burn. There is no cultivation in
the gill, the bottom of which is 600 feet above sea at its mouth, the gill being 400

feet deep and half a mile wide from ridge to ridge. The belt of wood clothes the

sides for 200 feet, or up to 800 feet at its mouth, and ends where the bed of the

stream reaches 900 feet, in a distance of rather over a mile. The wood consists of

mountain-ash, ash, alder, oak, birch, holly, and thorn, and above 900 feet, the

Now let us compare the above heights with the elevations at which their remains

are found buried in the peat.

Thus the highest livinfi Birches are in Long Gill, 1,175, Barnley Beck, 1,125, and

High Scar Backstone Gill, Nidderdale, 1,100. But birch-stems are found in the peat

Wooup to 1,725 feet, and doubtless higher. The highest living Hazel is in        Gill,

1,350 feet, but there was a time when the hazel not only grew but ripened its nuts

at 1,G50 feet, on the moor east of Henstone Band at the head of Gate-up Gill.

Here I found buried in the peat hazel-nuts, many of which were bored by a maggot,

proving that the nut came to maturity, and the kernel was eaten out by the worm.

The highest living oaks are two in High Scar, Bakstone GiU, 1,100, and Fox

Crag ditto, one oak, 950. Birk GiU, 900. These are solitary instances, and are all

very small ; but there are many oaks in the peat between Blagshaw Gill and
Brown Kigg, 1,000 to 1,250 feet in Nidderdale.

From the remains of the lost forest we can distinguish two zones : that of oaks

up to about 1,200 feet, and that of birches above that level.

Of the valley proper, the birch and thorn covered the upper part of the sides of

the dale, or the ' edge,' while in the bottom there floiu-ished sycamore, ash, holly,

hazel, alder, wych elm, and near the dale-head the lieckberry (bird cherry), as

proved by their remains found on the scars, &c.

    The peat, which overwhelmed the ancient forests, is not now forming, but on
the whole is now undergoing a process of destruction. Except in the ' whams

(swamps), the conditions for its formation do not exist. In summer, on the higher

ranges, the peat becomes very dry and dust-like, when it is swept away by the

strong winds. Near Great Whernside acres together of bare rock have been thus

denuded.

   --The peat on these moors does not run to a great thickness about 6 to 8 feet is
--the general observation a fact which reduces our conception of the length of time

required for its formation, and gives some colour to my interpretation of the words

' shaw ' and ' with,' occurring on these moors.

With (O.-Norsk. Vidr, a wood) does not occur in Nidderdale above Hartwith,

but in Washburndale 'Blay^vithYJ hum' (0.-N.iri'fl7«?Hr,aswamp), is over 1,000 feet

on the open moors. Blay means bleak, so the Blaywith Wham would thus mean

' Bleak IF oofZ Szvamp.' There are no trees there now, and there are none at

Giimwith. This raises the curious question. Were there trees there since the Danes

settled in this part? Some light may be thrown upon the answer b}^ the parallel

case of 'Shaw,' a wood (O.-N. -S'AJ///-), a word apparently exclusively Danish in this
sense as it is common in JutishKent. (O.-N. Skogr. Swed. Sko(/,'D-a,n. Skov, a wood.)

T);e analogous words A.-S. Sciia O.-N. Skaiggi Dut. Schawe mean shade, shelter.

Shaw, meaning wood, is common in the ballads and Chaucer, as in the beautiful

lilies in * Robin llood '

                           ' In somer when the shawes be sheen,
                            And leves be large and lang.'

     It is therefore interesting to note that ' shaw' occurs many times on the open
moors, far above the present limits of tree-vegetation. In such positions ' shaw '
is now generally a boggy or rocky place associated with wet ground.

     There are no trees or bushes in Shaw Gill, 1,200 to 1,580 feet, or Shaw Gill Sike
1,150 to 1,400 on Feather Shaw, 1,250, West Shaw, 1,200, Foulshaw Crags, 1,000, or
on Shawsridge near Greenhow Hill. I cannot doubt that trees of some kind gave
the name to all these places when the Danes took possession of them 1,000 years

               DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY.

Chairman of the Departmext--Professor W. H. Flower, LL.D., F.K.S.,

                F.R.C.S., F.L.S., F.G.S., Pres. Z.S. (Vice-President of the Section).

                       THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.

The CHAiRMAif delivered the following Address :

It is. impossible for us to commence tlie -work of this Section of the Association

without having vividly brouglit to our minds the loss which lias befallen us since

--our last meeting the loss of one who was our most characteristic representative

--of the complex science of Anthropology one who had for many years conducted

with extraordinary energy, amidst multifarious other avocations, a series of re-

searches into the history, customs, and physical characters of the early inhabitants

of our island, for which he was so especially fitted by his archreological, historical,

and literary as well as his anatomical knowledge, and who was also the most

popular and brilliant expositor, to assemblies such as meet together on these occa-

sions, of the results of those researches. I need scarcely say that I refer to

Professor Eolleston.

     Within the last few months the study of our subject in this country has

--received an impulse from the publication of a book small in size, it is true, but

full of materials for thought and instruction--the ' Anthropology ' of Mr. E. B,
Tylor, the first work published in English with tliat title, and one very diflerent

in its scope and method from the older ethnological treatises.

The immense array of facts brought together in a small compass, the terseness

and elegance of the style, the good taste and feeling with which ditticalt and often

burning questions are treated, should give this book a wide circulation among all

classes, and thoroughly familiarise both the word and the subject to English

readers.

The origin and early history of man's civilisation, his language, his arts of life,

his religion, science, and social customs in the primitive conditions of society, are

subjects in which, in consequence of their direct continuity with the arts and

sciences, religious, political, and social customs among which we all live,by which
we are all influenced, and about which we all have opinions, every person of ordinary

education can and should take an interest. In fact, really to understand all these

problems in the complex condition in which they are presented to us now, we
ought to study them in their more simple forms, and trace them as far as ma}' be

to their origins.

     But, as the author remarks, this book is only an introduction to anthropology,

rather than a summary of all that it teaches ; and some, even those that many con-

sider the most important, branches of the subject are but lightly touched upon, or

wholly passed over.

     In one of the estimates of the character and opinions of the very remarkable

man and eminent statesman, whose death the country was mourning last spring, it
was stated : ' Lord Beaconsfield had a deep-rooted conviction of the vast importance

of race, as determining the relative dominance both of societies and of indivi-

duals ; ' ' and with regard to the question of what he meant by * race,' we have a

--key in the last published work of the same acute observer of mankind : ' Language

and religion do not make a race there is only one thing which makes a race, and

Nowthat is blood.' "^  ' blood ' used in this sense is defined as ' kindred ; relation by

natural descent from a common ancestor ; consanguinity.' ^ The study of the true

relrttionsliip of the different races of men is then not only interesting from a

 scientific point of view, but of great importance to statesmanship in siicli a country

as this, emhracinn;' subjects representing almost every known luodification of the
human species whose varied and often contiicting interests have to be regulated and
provided for. It is to want of appreciation of its importance that many of the incon-
sistencies and shortcomings of the government of our dependencies and colonies are

due, especiall}' the great inconsistency between a favourite English theory and a too

--common English practice the former being that all men are morally and in-

tellectually alike, the latter being that all are equally inferior to himself in all

respects : both propositions ,egregiously fallacious. The study of race is at a low
ebb indeed when we hear the same contemptuous epithet of 'nigger' applied
indiscriminately by the Englishman abroad to the blacks of the West Coast of
Africa, the Kaffirs of Natal, the Lascars of Bombay, the Hindoos of Calcutta, the

aborigines of Australia, and even the Maoris of New Zealand !

     But how is he to know better ? Where in this country is any instruction to be
had? Where are the books to which he may turn for trustworthy information ?
The subject, as I have said, is but slightly touched upon in the last published
treatise on anthropology in our language. The great work of Pritchard, a com-
pendium of all that was known at the time it was written, is now almost entirely

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    .

out of date. In not a single university or public institution throughout the three

kingdoms is there any kind of sj'stematic teaching, either of physical or of any

other branch of anthropology, except so far as comparative philology may be con-
sidered as bearing upon the subject. The one society of which it is the special

business to promote the study of these questions, the Anthropological Institute

of Great Britain and Ireland, is, I regret to say, far from flourishing. An anthropo-

logical museum, in the proper sense of the word, either public or private, does not

exist in this country.

    What a contrast is this to what we see in almost every other nation in Europe t
At Paris there is, first, the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, where man, as a zoological

--subject-- almost entirely neglected in our British Museum has a magnificent gallery

allotted to him, abounding not only in illustrations of osteology, but also in models,
casts, drawings, and anatomical preparations showing various points in his physical
or natural history, which is expounded to the public in the free lectures of the

venerable Professor Quatrefages and his able coadjutor, Dr. Hamy ; there is also

the vigorous'Society of Anthropology, which is stated in the last annual report to
number 720 members, showing an increase of 44 during the year 1880, and which

is forming a museum on a most extensive scale; and, finally, the School of Anthropo-

logy, founded by the illustrious Broca, whose untimely death last year, instead of
paralysing, seems to have stimulated the energies of colleagues and pupils into in-

creased activity. In this school, supported partly by private subscriptions, partly
by the public liberality of the Municipality of Paris, and of the Department of the
Seine, are laboratories in which all the processes of anthropological manipulation
are practised by students and taught to travellers. Here all the bodies of persons

of outlandish nationalities dying in any of the hospitals of Paris are dissected by
competent and zealous observers, who carefully record every peculiarity of structure
discovered, and are thus laying the foundation for an exhaustive and trustworthy
collection of materials for the comparative anatomy of the races of man. Here,

furthermore, are lectureships on all the different branches. Biological and ana-
tomical anthropology, ethnology, pre-historic, linguistic, social, and medical an-

thropology are all treated of separately by eminent professors who have made
these departments their special study. The influence of so much activity is spread-
ing beyond the capital. The foundation of an Anthropological Society at Lyons

has been announced within the present year.
     In Germany, although there is not at present any institution organised like the

school at Paris, the flourishing state of the Berlin Ethnological Society, which
also reports a large increase in the number of its members, the various other
societies and journals, and the important contributions which are continually being
made from the numerous intellectual centres of that land of learning, all attest the

interest which the study of man excites there. In Italy, in the Scandinavian

Akingdoms, in Russia, and even in Spain, there are signs of similar activity.

glance at the recent periodical literature of America, especially the publications of

the Smithsonian Institution, will shov? how strongly the scientific work of that

country is setting in the same direction.

     It is true that a very great proportion of the energies of the societies, institu-

tions, and individuals who cultivate this vast subject are, in all these lands, as it is

indeed to so great an extent in our own, devoted to that branch which borders

upon the old and favourite studies of archaeology and geology. The fascinating

power of the pursuit of the earliest traces of man's existence upon the earth, with

the possibilities of obtaining some glimpses of his mode of origin, is attested in the

devotion seen everywhere in museums, in separate publications, and in journals, to

pre-historic anthropology.

But, though the study of man's origin and earliest appearances upon the earth, and

that of the structural modifications to which in course of time he has arrived, or

the study of races, are intimately related, and will ultimately throw light upon

one another, I venture to think that the latter is the more pressing of the two, as

it is certainly the more practically important ; and hence tlie necessity for greater

attention to physical anthropology. In seeking for a criterion upon which to base

our study of races, in looking for essential proofs of consanguinity of descent from

common ancestors in ditl'erent groups of men, I have no hesitation in saying that
we must first look to their physical or anatomical characters, next to their moral

--and intellectual characters for our purpose more difHcult of apprehension and

--comparison and, lastly, as aflbrding hints, often valuable in aid of our researches,

but rarely to be depended upon, unless corroborated from other sources, to lan-

guage, religion, and social customs.

The study of the physical or anatomical character nf the races of man is un-

fortunately a subject beset with innumerable ditticulties. It can only be ap-

proached with full advantage by one already acquainted with the ordinary fiicts
of human anatomy, and with a certain amount of zoological training. The

methods used by the zoologist in discriminating species and varieties of animals,

and the practice acquired in detecting minute resemblances and diilerences that

an ordinary observer might overlook, are just what are required in the physical

anthropologist.

As the great problem which is at the root of all zoology is to discover a natural

classification of animals, so the aim of zoological anthropology is to discover a natural

Aclassification of man.  natural classification is an expression of our knowledge of
--real relationship, of consanguinity of ' blood,' as the author of ' Endymiou ' ex-

presses it. AYhen we can satisfactorily prove that any two of the known groups

of mankind are descended from the same common stock, a point is gained. The

more such points we have acquired, the more nearly shall we be able to picture to
ourselves, not only the present, but the past distribution of the races of man upon

the earth, and the mode and order in whicli they have been derived from one

another.

    The difficulties in the way of appljnng zoological principles to the classification
of man are vastly greater than in the case of most auimals ; the problem being, as

we shall see, one of much greater complexity. When groups of animals become

so far differentiated from each other as to represent separate species, they remain

--isolated ; they may break up into further subdivisions in fact, it is only by further

subdivision that new species can be formed; but it is of the very essence of species,
as now universally understood by naturalists, that they cannot recombine, and so

give rise to new forms. With the varieties of man it is otherwise. They have

never so far separated as to answer to the physiological delinition of species. All

races are fertile one with another, though perhaps in diii'ereut degrees. Hence new

varieties have constantly been formed, not only by the segmentation, as it were, of

a portion of one of the old stocks, but also by various combinations of those already

established.

Neither of the old conceptions of the history of man, which pervade! the

thought, and form the foundation of the works of all ethnological writers up to the

last few years, rest on any solid basis, or account for the phenomena of the present

--condition and distribution of the species.
    The one view that of the monogenist-- was that all races, as we see them now, are

the descendants of a single pair, who, in a comparatively short period of time, spread

over the world from one common centre of origin, and became modified by degrees

in consequence of changes of climate and other external conditions. The other

--that of the polygenist is that a certain number of varieties or species (no agree-

ment has been arrived at as to the number, which is estimated by different authorities

at from three to twenty or more) have been independently created in different

parts of the world, and have perpetuated the distinctive characters as well as the

geographical position with which they were originally endowed.

    The view which appears best to accord with what is now known of the

characters and distribution of the races of man, and with the general phenomena of
nature, may be described as a modification of the former of these hypotheses.

     Without entering into the difficult question of the method of man's first

--appearance upon the world, we must assume for it a vast antiquity at all events

as measured by any historical standard. Of this there is now ample proof During

--the long time he existed in the savage state a time compared to which the
--dawnof our historical period was as yesterday he was influenced by the operation

of those natural laws which have produced the variations seen in other regions of

organic nature.                          The  first men may  very probably have been all alilie                                                                                                                               but, when
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

spread over the face of the earth, and become subject to all kinds of diverse

--external conditions climate, food, competition with members of his own species
--or with wild animals racial differences began slowly to be developed through the

potency of various kinds of selection acting upon the slight variations which

appeared in individuals in obedience to the tendency implanted in all livino-

things.

     Geographical position must have been one of the main elements in determining

the formation and the permanence of races. Groups of men isolated from their

fellows for long periods, such as those living on small islands, to which their

ancestors may have been accidentally drifted, would naturally, in course of time

Adevelop a new tj-pe of features, of skull, of complexion or hair.                          slight set in

one direction, in any of these characters, would constantly tend to intensify itself,

and so new races would be formed. In the same way different intellectual or

moral qualities would be gradually developed and transmitted in different groups

of men. The longer a race thus formed remained isolated, the more strongly im-

pressed and the more permanent would its characteristics become, and less liable

to be changed or lost, when the surrounding circumstances were altered, or under

--a moderate amount of intermixture from other races the more 'true,' in fact,

would it be. On the other hand, on large continental tracts, where no ' moun-
tains interposed make enemies of nations,' or other natural barriers form obstacles

to free intercourse between tribe and tribe, there would always be a tendency

towards uniformitj', from the amalgamation of races brought into close relation by
war or by commerce. Smaller or feebler races have been destroyed or absorbed bv
others impelled by superabundant population or other causes to spread beyond

their original limits; or sometimes the conquering race has itself disappeared by

absorption into the conquered.

Thus, for untold ages, the history of man has presented a shifting kaleidoscopic

scene                         new races  gradually becoming  differentiated out of the old  elements, and,
                           ;

after dwelling awhile upon the earth, either becoming suddenly annihilated or

gradually merged into new combinations ; a constant destruction and reconstruc-

a constant tendency to separation and differentiation, and a tendency to com-
--tion
                        ;
bine again into a common uniformity the two tendencies acting against and modi-

fying each other. The history of these processes in former times, except in so far as

they may be inferred from the present state of tilings, is a diflicult study, owino-

to the scarcity of evidence. If we had any approach to a complete paheonto-

logical record, the history of man could be reconstructed ; but nothing of the kind

is forthcoming. Evidences of the anatomical characters of man, as he lived on

the earth during the time when the great racial characteristics were being devc-

loped, during the long ante-historic period in which the negro, the Mongolian, and

the Caucasian were being gradually fashioned into their respective types, is entirely
wanting, or, if any exists, it is at present safely buried in the earth, perhaps to
be revealed at some unexpected time, and in some unforeseen manner.

It will be observed, and perhaps observed with perplexity by some, that no

definition has as yet been given of the oft-recurring word ' race.' The sketch just
drawn of the past history of man must be sufficient to show that any theory imply-

ing that the different individuals composing the human species can be parcelled out

into certain definite groups, each with its well-marked and permanent limits

separating it from all others, has no scientific foundation ; but that, in reality, these
individuals are aggregated into a number of groups of very different value in a
zoological sense, with characters more or less strongly marked and permanent, and

often passing insensibly into one another. The great groups are split up into minor

subdivisions, and filling up the gaps between them all are intermediate or inter-

calary forms, derived either from the survival of individuals retaining the general-

ised or ancestral characters of a race from which two branches have separated and
taken opposite lines of modification, or from the reunion of members of such

branches in recent times. If we could follow those authors who can clnssify man-

kind into such divisions as trunks, branches, races and sub-races, each having its

definite and equivalent meaning, our work would appear to be greatly simplified,
although perhaps we should not be so near the truth we are seeking. But being
not yet in a position to define what amount of modification is necessary to consti-

tute distinction of race, I am compelled to use the word vaguely for any consider-
able group of men who resemble each other in certain common characters trans-

mitted from generation to generation.

    In approaching the question of the classification of the races of man from a
physical point of view, we must bestow great care upon the characters upon which
we rely in distinguishing one group from another. It is well known in zoology

that the modifications of a single organ or system may be of great value, or may be

quite useless according as such modifications are correlated with others in different

organs or systems, or are mere isolated examples of variation in the economy

of the animal without structural changes elsewhere. The older ornithologists

associated in one order all the birds with webbed feet, and the order thus constituted,
Katatores or Falmipcdes, which received the great sanction of Cuvier, still stands
in many zoological compilations. Recent investigations into the anatomy of birds
have shown that the species thus associated together show no other sign of natural

aflinity, and no evidence of being derived from the same stock. In fact, there is
tolerably good proof that the webbing of the feet is a merely adaptive cliaracter,

developed or lost, present or absent, irrespective of other structural modifications.

In the same way, when anthropology was less advanced than it is now, it was

"thought that the distinction between long and short-headed, dolichocephalic and

brachycephalic people, pointed out by Eetzius, indicated a primary division of the

buman species; but it was afterwards discovered that, although the character
was useful otherwise, it was one of only secondary importance, as the long-headed

as well as the short-headed group both included races otherwise of the strongest

dissimilarity.

      In all classifications, the point to be first ascertained is the fundamental plan of

construction ; but in cases where the fundamental plan has undergone but little

modification, we are obliged to make use of what appear trivial characters, and
compensate for their triviality by their number. The more numerous the combi-

nations of specialised characters, by which any species or race differs from its con-

g:eners, the more confidence we have in their importance. The separation of what
is essential from what is incidental or merely superficial in such characters lies at

the root of all the problems of this nature that zoologists are called upon to solve;
and in proportion as the difiiculties involved in this delicate and often perplexing

discrimination are successfully met and overcome will the value of the conclusions

be increased. These difficulties, so familiar in zoology, are still greater in the

case of anthropology. The differences we have to deal with are often very slight;

and trouble in heaping up elaborate tables of measurements, and minutely

recording every point that is capable of description, with little regard to any con-

clusions that may be drawn from them. It is certainly time now'to endeavour, if

po.^sible, to discriminate characters which indicate deep-lying affinity from those

that are more transient, variable or adaptive, and to adjust, as far as may be, the

proper importance to be attached to each.

It is, however, quite to be expected that, in the infancy of all sciences, a vast

amount of labour must be expended in learning the methods of investigation. In

none has this been more conspicuous than in the subject under consideration.

Many have come to despair, for instance, of any good, commensurate with the time

it occupies, coming of the minute and laborious work involved ia craniometry.

WeThis is because nearly all our present methods are tentative.                                                                         have not yet

learnt, or are only beginning to learn, what lines of investigation are profitable

and what are barren. The results, even as far as we have gone, are, however,
myquite sufficient, in
                        opinion, to justify perseverance. I am, however, not so sure

whether it be yet time to answer the demand, so eager and so natural, which is

being made in many quarters for the formulation of a definite plan of examination,

measurement, and description to which all future investigation should rigidly

adhere. All steps to promote agreement upon fundamental points are to be' cor-

dially welcomed, and meetings or congresses convened for such a purpose will be
of use by giving opportunities for the'impartial discussion of the relative value of
difierent methods ; but the agreement will finally be brought about by the general

adoption of those measurements and methods which experience proves to be the
most useful, while others will gradually fall into disuse by a kind of process of

natural selection.

The changes and improvements which are being made yearly, almost monthly,

in instruments and in methods, show what we should lose if we were to stop at any

given period, and decree in solemn conclave that this shall be our final system,

this instrument and this method shall be the only one used throughout the world,
Wethat no one shall depart from it.
                                                                                                                                        scarcely need to ask how long such an

agi-eement would be binding. The subject is not sufficiently advanced to be

reduced to a state of stagnation such as tliis would bring it to.

To take an example from what is perhaps the most important of the anatomical

characters by which man is distinguished from the lower animals, the superior from

the inferior races of man                                                                                               the smaller or  greater projection forwards of  the lower
                                                                                                                     :

part of the face in relation to the skull proper, or that which contains the brain.
From the time when Camper drew his facial angle, to the present day, the readiest

and truest method of estimating this projection has occupied the attention of ana-

tomists and anthropologists, and we are still far from any general agreement.

Every country, every school, has its own system, so different that comparison with

one another is well-nigh impossible. This'is undoubtedly an evil ; but the question

is whether we sTiould all agree to adopt one of the confessedly defective systems now

in vogue, or whether we should not rather continue to hope for, and endeavour to

Wefind, one which may not be subject to the well-known objections urged against all.

          want, especially in this country, more workers, trained and experienced men
who will take up the subject seriously, and devote themselves to it continuously.
Of such we may say, without offence to those few who have done occasional excel-

lent work in physical anthropology, but whose chief scientific activity lies in other

fields, we have not one. In the last number of the French Rei-ue cV Anthropologic,
a reference caught my eye to a craniometrical method in use by the ' English school

of anthropologists. It was a reference only to a method which I had ventured to

Asuggest, but which, as far as I know, has not been adopted by anyone else.
school is just what we have not, and what we want--a body of men, not only

willing to learn, but able to discuss, to criticise, to give their approval to, or reduce

to its proper level, the results put forth by our few original investigators and

writers. The rapidity with which anyone of the most slender pretensions who

ventures into the field (I speak from painful experience) is raised to be an oracle

among his fellows is one of the most alarming proofs of the present barrenness of

the land.

     Another most urgent need is the collection and preservation of the evidences

of the physical structure of the various modifications of man upon the earth.
Especially urgent is this now, as we live in an age in which, in a far greater degree

than any previous one, the destruction of races, both by annihilation and absorption,

is o-oin"- on. The world has never witnessed such changes in its ethnology as those
now taking place, owing to the rapid extension of maritime discovery and mari-
time commerce, which is especially affecting the island population among whicli,
more than elsewhere, the solution of the most important anthropological problems
may be looked for. If we have at present neither the knowledge nor the leisure to
examine and describe, we can at least preserve from destruction the materials for

our successors to work upon. Photographs, models, anatomical specimens, skele-
tons or parts of skeletons, with their histories carefully registered, of any of the
so-called aboriginal races, now rapidly undergoing extermination or degeneration,

will be hereafter of inestimable value. Drawings, descriptions, and measurements
are also useful, though in a far less degree, as allowance must always be made for
imperfections in the methods as well as the capacity of the artist or observer. Such

collections must be made upon a far larger scale than has hitherto been attempted,

as, owing to the difficulties already pointed out in the classification of man, it is

only by large numbers that the errors arising from individual peculiarities or

accidental admixture can be obviated, and the prevailing characteristics of a race
or group truly ascertained. It is only in an institution commanding the resources

of the nation that such a collection can be formed, and it may therefore be confi-
dently hoped that the trustees of the British Museum will appropriate some por-
tion of the magnificent new building, which has been provided for the accommoda-

tion of their natural history collections, to this hitherto neglected branch of the

subject.

  --I have mentioned two of the needs of anthropology in this country more
--workers and better collections : there is still a third that of a society or institution

in which anthropologists can meet and discuss their respective views, with a journal

in which the results of their investigations can be laid before the public, and a

library in which they can find the books and periodicals necessary for their study.

All this ought to be provided by the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain

and Ireland, which originated in the amalgamation of the old Ethnological and

Anthropological Societies. But, as I intimated some time ago, the Institute does

not at the present time flourish as it should; its meetings are not so well attended

as they might be ; the journal is restricted in its powers of illustration and print-

ino- by want of funds; the library is quite insufficient for the needs of the student.

This certainly does not arise "from any want of good management in the Society

itself. Its affairs have been presided over and administered by some of the most

eminent and able men the country has produced. Huxley, Lubbock, Busk, Evans,

Tylor and Pitt-Kivers have in succession given their energies to its service, and

yet the number of its members is falling away, its usefulness is crippled, and its

very existence seems precarious. Some decline to join the Institute, others leave

it, upon the plea that, being unable from distance or other causes to attend the

meetino-s, they cannot obtain the full return for  their subscriptions                                                                                       others on the
                                                                                                                                                          ;

ground that the Journal does not contain the exact information which they re-

quire.

     There surely is to be found a sufficient number of persons, influenced by
different considerations, who feel that anthropological science is worth cultivating,
and that those who are laboriously and patiently tracing out the complex problems
of man's diversity and man's early history are doing a good work, and ought to be
encouraged by having the means afforded them of carrying on their investigations

--and of placing the results of their researches before the world who feel, more-

over, that there ought to be some central body, representing the subject, which

may, on occasion, influence opinion or speak authoritatively on matters often of great

practical importance to the nation.

    There must be many in this great and wealthy country who feel that they

are helping a good cause "in joining such a society, even if they are not individu-

ally receiving what they consider a full equivalent for their small subscription

many who feel satisfaction in helping the cause of knowledge, in helping to remove

the opprobrium that the British Anthropological Society alone of those of the
world is lacking iu vitality, and in helping to prevent this country from fallino-

behmd all the nations in the cultivation of a science in which for the strongest

reasons it might be expected to hold the foremost place. It is a far more grateful

task to maintain, extend, and if need he improve, an existing organisation, than to

·construct a new one. I feel, therefore, no hesitation in urging upon all who take

interest in the promotion of the study of Anthropology to rally round the Institute,
and to support the endeavours of the present excellent President to increase its

usefulness.

                         By Dr. Beddoe, F.B.S,

The paper was based mainly on the facts gotten by KSrosi and by Scheiber, of
Bucharest, from the national recruiting statistics. The wTiter, from Kcirosi's

data, estimated the average stature of the fully grown Hungarian soldier at about

1,668 millimetres, or 5 feet 5f inches English. There is a good deal of difference
between the several races included in the returns, the Germans and Croats for

^example, being taller than the Magj^ars and Roumanians. The citizens of Buda-

pesth, Stuhlweissemburg, and Raab are taller than the neighbouring country-folks

at least Scheiber found it so at the age of twenty. Similarly Quetelet found the
townsmen taller in Belgium, but in England the reverse is the case. In five
western counties (including Pesth), where the popidation is mainly Ma-n-ar the
mean stature at 26 years may be estimated at 5 feet 5-2 inches.         ''"

1. The Viking's Ship, discovered at Sandefjord in Norway, 1880.'

              By J. Haekis Stone, Af.A., F.L.S., F.G.8.

    The writer paid several visits to the ship and carefully examined her. He

also took four photographs of portions of the vessel. These, with diagrams made
from them, were exhibited to the Section.

    The paper professes to be nothing more than an account of the vessel, prepared

after the writer's visits.

After alluding to the good state of preservation in which the vessel was found

and fixing--as near as possible--the probable date, by referring briefly to the ViMng

period, the writer shortly alludes to the Frithiof Saga, giving a few extracts
which bear upou ships for the purpose of showing (1) the feeling of the period
         these vessels, and
towards  so clearly evinced   (2j also as explaining the  careful  and  thorouo°-h  work-
manship                      in this Sandefjord vessel.

    The writer states the reason why the vessel was found in a mound, namely

that a Viking was buried iu her, and describes the sepulchral chamber.

The galleys depictedin the Bayeux tapestry were alluded to, and their shape

compared 'W'ith that of this vessel.

    ' A full account of the vessel, by the same writsr, appeared in the November

number of Good Words for 1881.

2. On Excavations in the Earthwork called Danes' ByJce at Flamhorough,.
        and on the Earthvmrhs of the Yorkshire Wolds. By Major-General

         PiTT-RiTERS, F.B.8. (formerly Colonel Lane-Fox).

     General Pitt-Eivers showed, by means of a large map, that many of the en-
trenchments on the Wolds and north of the Derwent Valley appeared to have

formed part of a connected system for the defence of the ground from the west-

ward. 1st. The entrenchment known as the Danes' Dyke, which cuts oS Flam-
borough Head, was ob^ iously an entrenchment intended to secure the promontory
from an attack fiom the west. Next the Argam Dyke was a work parallel to the

last, and probably formed the next position which the invaders took up as they
advanced inland. The North Wolds are fortified by an entrenchment which rims
along the top of the chalk escarpment overloolring the Derwent Valley, and several
entrenchments on the North and South Wolds run along the hills in a position to

command the valleys to the westward. On the oolite hills to the north of the

Derwent Valley there are numerous ra\"ines wliich run southward into the valley,,
and some of them are fortified by entrenchments on their eastern brow, which
proved that the defenders of the district anticipated an attack from the west.
General Pitt-Eivers made a cutting through the Danes' Dyke, to ascertain if possible
the date of its construction, and in so doing found evidence of the manufacture of
flint implements, both before and after the construction of the entrenchment.
Close beneath the top of the rampart he found a large number of flint flakes, lying
in a horizontal position just beneath the surface soil, in a position to prove that

the defenders must have" worked flints on the bank aftei- it had been made. As many

as 827 flakes and artificially formed chips of flint were found in this position.
This result shows that the dyke was not later than the Bronze Period, that is to

--say, the period of the tumuli on the Wolds, which Canon Greenwell has shown to

have belonged to the Early Bronze Age an age in which flint continued to be used
for many ordinary purposes. The question as to where the invaders came from, if in-
vaders they were",^^·as influenced by the consideration that the Early Bronze Age does
not appear to have existed in Demnark, and if the invaders came from there, some
 isolated specimens of bronze implements analogous to those found in Denmark
 would certainly have been found in the Wolds, instead of the simple triangular dagger
and axe-head, which is rarely found in Denmark. The idea that the dykes were
 made by Anglian invaders, however natural it at first sight appeared, must
 therefore, as the result of these diggings, be given up. The paper was illustrated
 by a section of the Danes' Dyke to scale, showing the positions of the objects found

  in it.

 S. On the Application of Composite Portraiture to Anth ropological purposes^
                                By Fkancis Galton, F.B.S.

      The author exhibited a composite picture of eight slaxlls of male Andaman
 Islanders. They had been successively mounted under the instruction of Mr.

  Flower, upon a rod passing through the occipital foramen, with the base of the
 skull at right angles to the rod. Each portrait represented one of the skulls in
 exact profile, with the light falling upon it from the same side. The separate

 portraits were combined into a single composite by the author's new instrument,
 described in the ' Photographic Journal ' of last June, and exhibited in the Loan
 Museum during the meeting. The portraits were successively adjusted hj the
  images of three fiducial lines. Thus the front edge of the image of the rod in each
 portrait was adjusted to a vertical line, and the base of the condyle to a horizontal

 one, in order to regulate the position of the skull, and tl.e point of intersection of
             --TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY,  691

the roof of the skull with the vertical line was made to accord with a second hori-

zontal line, in order to get uniformity of scale. The author referred to numerous

composites illustrating the physiognomy of disease, made by himself and Dr.
Mahomed, which were exhibited in the Loan Collection, as testifying to the applic-

ability of the process to various anthropological purposes, including the pictorial

definition of races. With the aid of the new instrument composites could be made
by him much more exactly and easily than had been possible before. The process

produces true anthropological averages. It gives an average face by a single set
of operations, between the features of which any number of cross measurements
can be made. It deals with averages of shading that can hardly otherwise be

dealt with, and it gi^es a picture at once, instead of data whence a picture may be

plotted. Lastly, it affords an excellent test whether any given series is generic or
not ; for when the portraits in the series make a good and clear composite it shows

that medium values are much more frequent than extreme values* and therefore
that the series may be considered a generic one ; otherwise it is certainly not

4. Account of the Discovery of Six Ancient Dwellings, found under and near

      to British Barrows on the Yorkshire Wolds. By J. R. Mortimer.

Dwelling No. 1 is in connection with barrow No. 100, group 5, in the author's

openings, and is situated at the eastern end of the barrow, which is of the long type.

Its depth from the base of the mound was 6^ feet, with a floor surface of 9i feet
by 7h feet, and it was entered by two inclining passages, 24 feet in length'; the

northern one being cut by the side trench of the barrow, showing in this case that

the construction of the dwelling had preceded the excavation of the trench, and

was therefore older than the barrow. In the material filling the dwelling and its

passages were many streaks of burnt wood, a human femur, portions of an urn,
Aand many animal bones, all probably the residue of feasting.
                                                               little distance

from the dwelling were portions of three more dish-shaped urns, and traces of

interments.

     Dwelling No. 2 was situated within 30 ft. of an oval barrow, in which were
cremated interments. It resembled the previous one in having two entrance-
passages, and much burnt wood, indicating likewise its destruction by fire.

     Nos. 3 and 4 are of a somewhat simpler kind than the preceding ones, having
no entrance-passages. They consist of nearly circular excavations in the rock,
from 3|- to 4^ feet in depth, and from 7 feet to 8\ feet in diameter, in which were
found bones of the red deer and the urns.

     No. 5 is of an entirely different type from those previously named : it bad

consisted of an inner and an outer circle of upright posts, measiiring in diameter

2U and 28 feet respectively, the impressions of which were well-preserved, and

show that some had been pointed and driven into the ground, whilst othei s had been
placed in holes dug uito the ground with their thick ends downwards, and in some

cases extending 2 feet to 3 feet upwards into the body of the mound. In the
centre of the two circles was a.n o^·al graAe, cut 4 feet into the rock, and containino-

the flexed human remains of a large male. In front of his face lay a crushed food°

vase, and close to liis lelt slioulder was a perforated axe-hammer, ('layey matter

covered the grave, and extended to the outer circle of post-holes. This was
believed to be the residue of the sides of the dwelliug, in the centre of which its
owner was interred, and afteiMards the walls were pushed down over the ^rave
and covered with a mound. The author suggests that the space between the two

circles of uprights miarht have been used for storing heads of gi-ain, an<l other pro-

visions for winter use, at a time when, probably, man's dwelling was the onlv

building he possessed for all purposes.

     No. 6 resembles the last, and was found under barrow No. 41. Here also was
a circular bed of a clayey nature, 15 feet in diameter, and with stake-holes nearly

all round its margin. These stake-holes reached from 12 to 18 inches into the

ground under the barrow, and in three cases 5 feet upwards into the body of the
moimd. Small branches of oak, ash, maple, and other trees, thought to' be the

             Ty2
--692 EEPORT 1881.

Temains of the wattled sides of the liut, had left their impressions in the circular
hed of clayey matter, some of which showed cuts made with the axe and the
saw, seemingly of metal. The dropping from the eaves of this hut had stained the
ground all roimd with colouring from the thatch of the roof, which probably was
the straw of wheat, as the author possesses carbonised grains of this cereal from
the primary interment of an undoubted British barrow near. Unlike the previous
dwelling, the occupier had not been interred within the walls of this circle, but
just a few feet outside, towards the rising sun. The bones were accompanied by a
delicately formed flint knife lying close to the right arm, and a finely ornamented

food vase near the head. As in the previous case the dwelhng had been crushed
down at the time of interment, and carefully covered with the barrow, showing

but a step between the habitation of the living and the house of the dead.

     5. On the Origin and. Use of Oval Tool-stones. By W. J. Knowles.

      The author stated that the use of oval tool-stones was not clearly understood.
Sir WiUiam Wilde, in the Catalogue of the Royal Irish Academy, defines them as

oval or egg-shaped stones, more or less indented on one or both surfaces. He states

that their use is problematical, and that they were ' denominated Tilhuggersteens

by the Northern antiquaries, who consider them chippers of flint or stone, and
believe that in working they held them between the finger and thumb applied to

 these side cavities.' Sir John Lubbock, in ' Prehistoric Times,' gives a somewhat
 similar accoimt of them, and states that it is very doubtful whether they really
belong to the Stone Age. Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., states in his Presidential
 Address to the Anthropological Institute on January 29, 1878, when referring to
 a case where one was found with flint scrapers and other objects, that 'if it could
 be proved that they were contemporaneous he would more readily accept the scrapers
 as being of the Age of Iron, than the tool-stones as belonging to that of Stone.'
 The author has found a few of these tool-stones with flint objects in the sandhills
 of Portstewart and Ballintoy, in the North of Ireland, and on one occasion he dug
 up half of a tool-stone closely associated with flint scrapers, flakes, hammer-stones,

 and cores at Ballintoy. He had frequently found stones with roughened and indented

 spots, which appeared to be oval tool-stones in an early stage of formation. In the
 sandhills of Dundrum, county Down, he obtained several of these among the flint
 objects ; but during the summer of 1880, when excavating a spot which must have
 been the site of an ancient dwelling-place, he dug up a very perfect stone hatchet
 seven inches long, two flint knives, several scrapers, hammer-stones, and cores, and
 among these a stone of the tool-stone class having one central pitted spot. The
  finding of this pitted stone in such close proximity to cores, hammer-stones, and
 flakes, caused the author to believe that the flint implement-makers must have
 supported their cores or blocks of flint on a stone anvil, when about to dislodge flakes,
  by striking with the hammer-stone, and that such an operation constantly repeated
  would produce the pits on the anvil. This idea was confirmed by a similar anvil-
  stone of larger size, with hammer-stones, flakes, and cores, being turned out during

  excavations which the Mai-chioness of Downshire afterwards had made in Dundrum

  Sandhills, and he believed that the anvil-stone was just as necessary a part of the
  stock-in-trade of the flint implement-maker as the hammer-stones and cores. _At
  Ballintoy, on a subsequent occasion, he obtained another of these anvil-stones, which
  had been split, and both in this one and several other broken specimens in the author's

  ment to see the effect of repeatedly hammering at a core resting on a stone anvil,
  the author produced a pit in the anvil-stone identical in appearance with that on
  the tool-stones, but on continuing the operation the stone split exactly through the

  centre of the pit. He therefore believed that it was owing to repeated blows on

  the same spot that the stones had split through the centre.

cores, scratches are visible, showing how the core had jerked from the pitted part
in the centre towards the circumference. He believed that the forming of pits by
the operation of striking oft' flakes had given the idea of boring, and that many of
the stone hammers had been bored in this way.

     The author was of opinion that, if we conceive the idea that the tool-stones are

anvils, there is no necessity for contining their use to any age. If they were of the

Stone Age it was possible, and even likely, their use would descend to the age of
Iron. He referred to a stone which he had seen in the Christy Collection in Lon-
don some time ago, sticking in a mass of breccia, composed chiefly of flint flakes and

fragments of broken bones, which had been brought from one of the rock shelters
in France. This stone had a cup-shaped depression like the tool-stones. At the

time he did not understand its use, but he had now no hesitation in saying that he
believed it to be an anvil-stone, and that we must, therefore, carry back the use of

the tool-stone, not only to the Stone Age, but to a very early Stone Age.

6. On the Discovery of Flint Implements in stratified gravel in the Nile
        Valleij, near Thebes. By Major-General Pitt-Rivers, F.B.S. (for-

         merly Colonel Lane-Fox).

     General Pitt-Rivers visited Thebes in March 1881, and examined the gravel in
the Nile Valley, to ascertain if the remains of flint implement manufactm-e coidd be

found in it. He found flint flakes in the banks of the wady which runs down

from the Tombs of the Kings. The section here shows 3 feet 9 inches of gravel on

the top, composed of sub-angular and rounded stones of chert and limestone, then
a seam of hard mud, and below that gravel again. The flakes were chiefly found
beneath the seam of mud. This gravel had become so hard in Egyptian times that
they were able to cut flat-topped tombs in it, supported by square pillars dried hard,
which had retained the sharpness of the edges to the present day. Skulls and the

remains of mummies and pottery were found in them, and some of the flint flakes
were chiselled out of the sides of these tombs. The tombs, judged by the pottery foimd
in them, have been pronounced by competent Egj'ptologists to be not later than

the XVIII. dynasty and perhaps earlier, proving very great age for the formation
of the gravel in which the tombs were cut. So long as the finds of flint implements
were confined to the surface, doubts as to their contemporaneity with Egyptian
civilisation might be fairly mooted, but the residts of this discovery place beyond
doubt the fact of their being of much earlier date. The paper was illustrated by
plans and sections drawn to scale and showing the position of the flints.

                            By Dr. Phen^, F.S.A., F.B.G.S.

     After adverting to the persistent retention of curious customs, and the handing

down from generation to generation the traditionary lore of ages long past, the
author referred to some of those which were corroborated by ancient monuments of
694 EEPORT--1881.

an unusual kind still famous on the Scottisli border. These consisted of sculptured

stones, earthworks, and actual ceremonies.
     Quoting from former writers, from family pedigrees, and other documents, it was

shown that the estates to which pertained such strange matters as follow, had heen
held alternately hj' those claiming under the respective nationalities, or more local
powers, and these, from their natural defensive features, must have been places of
border importance earlier than history records.

   -- --The district is occupied by the descendants often still traceable of Danes,

Jutes, Frisians, Picts, Scots, Angles, and Xormans ; and by a comparison of several
of the languages of these people, as well ancient as now existing, and also of the
Gothic, it was shown in relation to a particular class of the most curious monu-
ments, that the Norse 'ormr,' Anglo-Saxon ' vyrm,' old German 'wurm,' Gothic

' vaurms,' pronounced like our word worm ; and the word ' lint ' or ' liad,' also
German, and the Norse ' linni,' are all equivalent, and mean serpent ; and in some
cases the two words are united as in the modern German ' lindwurm,' and the Danish
and Swedish ' lindorm.' On this apparently rested the names of some of the places

having these strange traditions, as Linton or serpent-town, Wormiston or worm's
(ormr's) town, Ijndisfarne, the Farne-serpent island, now Holy Island, &c., and

also the various worm-hills, or serpent-mounds, of those localities.

     It was curious that the contest (like that of St. George) was sometimes with
two dragons, as shown on a sculptured stone in Linton Church, Roxburghshire, and
on a similar stone at Lyngby in Denmark, in the churchyard, where there was a
tradition that two dragons had their haunt near the church.

     From these and other facts, the author concluded that the contests were inter-

national, and in the case of two dragons, an allied foe, either national, religious,

or both, was overcome. He showed fi-om the Scottish seals that Scotland used

the dragon as an emblem, apparently deriving it from the Picts. That the Scandi-
navians also used it, and that these nationalities were antagonistic to the Saxon.

      In the time of David the First of Scotland, the first gi-eat centralisation of

Saxon power took place, and the powerful family of the Cumyns obtained, apparently
by conque.st, at least two of the localities havuig these strange traditions. Further,
as the political object was to suppress the Celtic and Scandinavian, or other local

national feeling, there could be little doubt that, however they obtained them, the per-
sons dispossessed were of one or other of the Northern tribes. Hence, probably the
middle-age tradition of the slaying of the serpent or dragon, or the serpent or dragon
bearer, on the Anglo-Scottish border. But he considered such traditions would
hardly have originated through such conquests, had not previous marvellous stories
existed of the prowess and conquest by the dragon (bearers) of the lands they in-
vaded, all the wonders of which would be transferred to the conqueror's conqueror.
Hence these stories were not to be set aside with a sneer, as in them was a germ of

history, giving us, perhaps, the only msight we could obtain of the prehistoric

customs and mythology of some of the ancient tribes of Britain. Earthen mounds,
tumuli, standing stones, &c., still existed in some of these localities, with aU of

which the dragon, serpent, or worm was associated in the legends.
     The author then described his personal experiences in the still existing dragon

ceremonies in the sinith of France and Spain, which were always either on the
present national or former less important provincial fi-qjiti-rs, and which still formed

the subjects of great ecclesiastical ceremonies.

   --One of the high ecclesiastical dignitaries of the North of England the Bishop of
--Durham is in the position of having to take part in such a ceremony. Whenever a

bishop of that diocese enters the manor of Sockburn for the first time, the Lord of
the Manor, who holds under the see of Durham, subject to the following tenure, has
to present the bishop, ' hi the viiddle of the river Tees, if the river is fordable, with the
falchion wherewith the champion Conyers destroyed the tcorm, dragon, ov JieryJlying
serpent, which destroyed man, woman, and child' in that district, and an ancient
altar, called ' Greystone^ still marks where the dragon was buried.

     The subject was illustrated with \-iews of all the places referred to, on the
Anglo-Scottish, French, and Spanish border countries, as well as drawings of the
sculptm-es, funereal urns, and other antiquities belonging to each locality.

4. On some Objects recently exhumed in Britain, of apparently Fluinician
                    origin. By Dr. Phene, F.8.A., F.B.G.S.

Tlie places at or near which the objects were discovered were described as

having in one case natural, in the other artificial, hillocks or tumuli of earth or

stone simulating rude animal outlines. One of the localities was the vicinity of

Dartmoor, the other that of the great serpentine mound, containing a chamber in

-- --the head, found by the author some years since not far from Loch Etive. In the

first Newton Abbot in Devonshire had been fomid, some years since, at a depth

of 25 feet below the surface, leaning against a prostrate oak tree, equally deeply

buried, a rudely carved black oak figure, under two feet in height ; at the last

--North Ballachulish a similar figure, nearly five feet high, including an attached

pedestal. As to the simulation of animal forms, natural and artificial, botli were

referred to in America and in France, and in or near them in each such case had

also been found figures somewhat similarly designed, but not in wood. But there

were stUl existing figures in wood and stone of almost identical sizes and outlines

Ain places long held by the Phoenicians, as Minorca, &c.  remarkable piece of

evidently Assyiiau scidpture, found in Lord Mount-Edgecumbe's estate in Devon-

.shire, lent fui'ther probability, from its locality being known a.s that of once

Phoenician occupation, and necessarily of importation in exchange for export tin, that

the object at Newton Abbot was made or imported by those people ; and thebronae

head of a cow found in a bog in Ireland, having the Phoenician emblems upon it,

seemed a further example of importation by them. The figure at North Ballachulish

had a clearly Oriental feature. The eyes were formed of white stone inserted in the

dark oak or ebony, and a recess at the base of the figui-e seemed evidently formed for

SL reliquary, and, with the sign of a crescent on the head, was pointed out by the

author as a proof of its being an object for worship. This figure was also found

at a depth from the surface, indicating a date as far back as the Phoenician traffic.

The thickness of peat under which it lay has been estimated at 12 feet. It was

shown that North Ballachulish and Newton Abbot were both secure and therefore

valuable harbours, and the gold of Sutherland and tin of Devon were a sufficient

inducement to attract Phoenician traders. Drawings of all the objects were

exhibited.

                1. Notes on the Geographical Distribution of Manhind.

                             By Miss A. W. Buckland.

    Commenting upon the fact that the Geographical Distribution of Man has not
occupied the attention of naturalists so much as that of plants and animals, Miss

Buckland quoted the ' Encyclopedia of Geography,' published in 1834, to show that,
although great advances have been made in Anthropological research since the
formation of the British Association, the problems of fifty years ago remain un-
sohed. Ethnologists are still divided into monogenists and polygenists, and
although at present the monogenist theory is in the ascendant, little has yet been
done towards the discovery of the original birthplace of the human species, or of
that semi-human progenitor depicted by Darwin.

     The origin of the black, the white, and the yellow races, distinctly depicted
on Egyptian monuments five thousand years ago, remains undiscovered ; whilst in

almost every island of the Pacific may be found traces of one or more vanished
races, differing from the two distinct peoples at present inhabiting them. The

Australians form another separate race, which has been connected by Professor
Huxley with the hill tribes of India, and also with the ancient Egyptians ; but
                                                                                                                                                                        --

696 EEPOBT-- 1881.

how and at what period they reached their present isolated position remains a

geographical and ethnological puzzle. The Australians seem also to hear a re-
semhlance to the earliest known men of Europe, in the form of the skull and the

great prominence of the hrow-ridges ; hut here also two races present themselves
almost contemporaneously. These are known, from the form of the skull, as the

dolicocephalic  or long-headed,  and  the  hrachycephalic  or round-headed races                                                                                        and
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the researches of the late Dr. Broca seem to prove the former to have been un-

doubtedly the most ancient. The Palaeolithic Age is divided into two periods

that of the Mammoth and that of the Reindeer. It is the men of the first period

who resemble the Australians, whilst those of the reindeer period are identified by

many anthropologists with the Esquimaux, and these are supposed to have been

driven out by a hrachycephalic race, bringing with them Neolithic weapons, a
knowledge of agriculture, &c. The Paleolithic men are supposed to have come
from Africa, whilst the Neolithic are traced by M. de Mortillet to Asia ; but how
and where the two types originated we cannot say. Madame Royer believes that

brachycephaly arises from an increase of brain-development ; but the Anda-
manese, .a very low race, are hrachycephalic. M. Hovelacque points out that the

anthropoid apes of Africa are dolicocephalic, whilst those of Asia are' roimd-

headed, thus suggesting a local origin for the two forms of skull. The dispersion

of these various races over the world was formerly accounted for by supposed ex-

tensions oi existing land masses, and the existence of a submerged continent in

the Pacific ; but the researches of the Challenger have led Mr. AVallace and others
to the conclusion that this continent never existed, and although certain e.xteusious

of existing lands are allowed, these alterations are supposed to have taken place

long before the advent of man upon the earth. Thus the peopling of oceanic

islands is left to chance, which, in the case of Australia, is rendered more difficult
from the slight acquaintance of the natives with navigation, and from the fact of

their diflering in race from the Papuans and Tasmanians. Miss Buckland there-

fore believes that either some comparatively recent land connection with Africa or

Asia must have existed, at present undiscovered, or that the antiquity of man must

be extended to Miocene times, at which period Australia received its present fauna

and flora by direct land connection vAth Asia.

In conclusion Miss Buckland looks upon the problems propounded by Latham

in the 8th edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica,' as to the unity, the geo-

gTaphical origin, the antiquity, and the futurity of mankind, as still awaiting

solution.

     2. On the Papuans and the Polynesians. By C. Staniland Wake.

    The author, after referring to the classification of the Oceanic Races made by
Mr. Keane, proceeded to show the diversity of type presented by the Papuans,
and also the great diificidty there is in fixing the race-character of the PoljTiesians.
It was pointed out that the Polynesians and Papuans have various features in
common, such as the beard, the full and expressive eye, and often a long and aquiline
nose, and that the latter exhibit certain Caucasian features more strongly than the

former. These are the prominent eyebrows, and great development of the general
pilous system, which Dr. Topinard refers to as special characteristics of the Austra-

lian race, and which are not uncommon in individuals among the peoples of Western
Europe. From this we must assume that, if the Polynesians belong to the so-
called Caucasian stock, the Papuans must also be Caucasians ; the latter, however,
approaching more nearly the Semitic branch and the former the Aryan branch.
The causes of the differences between the Polynesians and the Papuans were then
considered. The primitive stock from which both have sprung is probably now
represented by the Australian race, which had formerly a much wider extension
than at present, as its special characteristics before mentioned are possessed by the
Melanesian and Papuan races, and also by the Ainos and Todas. The presence
of two types among the Australians shows that they are not a pure race, and
probably they exhibit the influence of a Negrito element, which exists also
among the Papuans and the Melanesians, and perhaps even among the Malays.

The existence iu the Malay Archipelago and in New Guinea of peoples interme-

diate between the Papuans and Polynesians was then mentioned, the frizzly hair

which those peoples and the Papuans possess heiug explained as due to the pre-
sence of a Negrito element. The Jewish features of some of the Papuans, which

are often met with also among the Polynesians, is the result of Semitic influence.
The fundamental type of both Polynesians and Papuans was straight-haired and
long-headed, and might he called Austral-Caucasian. Reference was made to

various arts, habits, and customs, and also to language, as contirming the conclu-

sion thrt the Polynesians and Papuans are sprung from a common stock, although
the latter have been largely affected by crossing with the Negrito race, and by

the influence of an early Asiatic migration ; and the former have been as largely

affected by contact with a more modern Asiatic people, now represented by the
Malays, both races having been further influenced by the intermixture of Arab and

Indian blood, but the Papuans more especially.

3. On Excavations in a camp called Amhresbury Banlcs in Epping Forests
        By General Pitt-Eivees, F.B.S. (formerly Colonel Lane-Fox).

     This investigation has been conducted under the auspices of the Epping Forest
NaturaUsts' field club. General Pitt-Rivers first drew attention, by means of an
imaginary section, to the evidence to be derived from cuttings through the ramparts
of camps, which he said was of a very definite and reliable character ; all objects
found on the old surface line beneath the ramparts being of the age of the earthwork.
The result proved, by means of fragments of pottery and other small objects, that

this camp is British or Romano-British, that is, British before or after the Roman

conquest. The paper was illustrated by a plan and section of the camp.

4. On the Relation of Stone Circles to Outlying Stories or Tumuli or
   Neighbouring Hills, tuith some inferences therefrom. By A. L. Lewis.

     The author, from an examination of eighteen stone cncles in Southern Britain^
showed that their builders had in various ways made special references to different

points of the compass, but most particularly to the N.E. He then showed, from a
number of independent sources, ranging from the Prophet Ezekiel down to a foreign

correspondent of the ' Daily News,' that other ancient structures had similar references,

known to have arisen in connection with times and seasons, and various forms of
nature-worship ; that practices connected with such worship, and especially with
sun and fire worship, have come down, even in this country, to the present time
and that circular buildings and open circles have been and are used for worship of

this kind, and inferred from these facts that the British stone circles were used for

sun-worship probably iu the Druidic period. He then dwelt on the references to

the N. and E. in the orientation of English churches, which he thought to be

derived from the references to those quarters in the circles, as the Roman Catholic
churches, whether in Rome or London, are not so placed, and he gave some curious
details on this point. He concluded by drawing attention to the firm root taken by

Christianity in the Druidic countries of Gaul and Britain, and the great influence

exercised by those countries in the later Roman Empire, and especially in the

establishment of Christianity as the State religion.

5. Notes on some specimens of Saw-cuts and Drill-holes in hard Stones of

             Primeval Egyptian period. By W. Flinders Petrie.

     While examining the constructions of the earliest Egyptian period, many proofs

appeared of the methods of cutting hard stones, such as granite, diorite, basalt, &c.
     The tools appear to have been of bronze, with jewelled cutting edges, probably
698 REPORT-- 1881.

of beryl or crystallised corundum (coarse ruby), as quartz is incapable of doing tlie
work. The forms were straight saws and probably circular saws, and certainly
tube-driUs, like the modern diamond crown-drill. All these were about 15 hun-
dredths of an inch thick, and the drills from j^'^ths to 5 inches diameter. The
cutting was rapid, advancing 1 inch in diorite with 27 feet of motion. The
pressure and tractive force was very great (certainly many cwts.), the cutting
edges having in a single motion scored out grooves ^^o i^^h deep in the sides of a
cut in diorite. Thus altogether the method was more like that of a modern
planing tool than like the grinding cut of a lapidary's wheel. The sarcophagi
were usually sawn outside, and hollowed by rows of drill-holes.

     The examples exhibited comprised casts of saw-cuts and driU-holes made by erro-
neous work on granite sarcophagi, saw-cuts and drill-holes in diorite and basalt,
drill-holes in hmestone, and a cast of a fine case of a tube drill-hole in granite,
with part of the core still remaining, conclusively proving the form of the drill.

6. On the Numeral and Philological Relations of the Hebrew, Phoenician, or
   Ganaanitic Alphabet and the Language of the Khita Inscriptions, By
   Hyde Clarke.

     Aleph (Alpha) being used for 1, Beth (Beta) for 2, &c., their employment was
regarded as casual. Mr. Clarke had nevertheless instituted an investigation into
these numeral values to ascertain whether it is a law of language that One and

Elephant or Ox, Two and House or Town, exist as the same root or word. This
he found to be the case in many of what may be called the prehistoric or

'Turanian' languages. The result was to show that the affinities and origin of

the alphabet are not Semitic, but Turanian. He then proceeded to consider what

Turanian family furnished the prototype, and on examination with Ganaanitic, he
found it there. Some years ago he had discovered the Canaanite 3, in Sama-
khonitis, and this enabled him to test the series and to restore the Ganaanitic
numerals, and ascertain their place in language and their comparative philology.
These observations conformed with those he had before made for Khita, and
showed that the Ganaanitic was a language adopted in these inscriptions and would
furnish materials for their transcription. In reference to the position of the
Khita itself in the history of the ancient world, Mr. Glarke pointed to the
similarity of the Naga, a remarkable group of languages in India.

7. The Early Colonisation of Cyprus and Attica, and its relation to

                             Babylonia. By Hyde Clarke.

Mr. Clarke reported the results of recent investigations of autonymous coins of

Cyprus and Attica, of inscribed gems, and of the Cypriote syllabary. These had

afforded conformable linguistic materials. Thus the Cypriote character like Aleph

answers to Ne, but Ne signifies an Elephant. The character like Beth is Mo, and

this signifies Town, a variant of House. Such relations are supported by the coins.

The emblems on those of Salamis in Cyprus and the island of Salamis and on the

coins of Attica read with the equivalent meanings in the corresponding illustrative

Alanguages.  gem in the collection of Major di Cesnola bears the inscription

Ya-phou in Cypriote and Khita, and the objects include a spear, gazelle, and dog,

which read Ya-phou. On a gem from the excavations at Menidi in Attica is the

Cypriote character Ti, with a lion and stag, the word for both of which is Ti.

Thus the whole of the evidence is conformable, and it points to this result, that the

ancient Cypriote and Attic was related to the Akkad of Babylonia and constituted

a West Babylonian occupation. This accounts, more efficiently than any other

suggestion, for the accordance of the historic facts and archaeological evidence.

10. On the Utilisation of the Memory. By George Harris, LL.D., F.8.A.

     The writer commenced by observing that, important as the memory is, not only

in the pursuit of science but in the general conduct of life, proportionably important
also must be its due and proper cultivation.

     To artificial aids to memory he did not, however, attach much value ; most of
them indeed consisting in attempts to dispense with, rather than to aid, the
memory.

     Nevertheless, the power of the memory, by direct and proper cultivation, might

be prodigiously extended.

     The peculiar circumstances which most conduce to fix ideas in the memory

vrere next discussed.

     Different persons, he stated, differ more in respect to memory than with regard
to any other power ; and the memory, he considered, reflected the peculiar mental

character and constitution of the individual.

     The extent to which persons are able to voluntarily discharge from the memory
the recollection of matters which are no longer serviceable to them was discussed.

There can be no doubt, he said, that, everyone possesses to a large extent the
power of determining what matters he will recollect, and that this is a power

which is greatly improvable by exercise. He concluded that we have no
·direct power of the former kind, but that we are able to a great extent to

cause ideas to fade from the memory.
     In the case of animals, he believed that they have great power of retention, but

DO active voluntary power of recollection. In their case events are mainly, if

not entirely, recalled by association.

   11. On the Cultivation of the Senses. By George Harris, LL.D., F.8.A.

      The writer, after pointing out the use and describing the operations of the

different senses, in the case both of man and animals, proceeded to observe that,

while in the contrivance and arrangement of the various systems of education, due

provision has been made for the study of those different branches which are

considered most useful in life, none of these systems are planned in accordance
with the faculties of the mind ; in consequence of which, while some of these
faculties engross a very large share, others are quite neglected ; and the discipline
and cultivation of the senses in general are very little attended to, and in case of
certain of the senses are entirely neglected. The writer demonstrated that each
sense is of gi-eat practical value in its way, and each is also capable of being
extensively improved by cultivation.

      The co-operation and co-aid of the different senses, and also of the senses and
the reason, he described, together with the manner in which, both in animal con-

stitution and in the case of man, the deficiency or failure of one sense may be more
or less compensated by the cultivation and increased activity of the others. The

mpaper concluded with a concise inquiry as to whether, and to what extent, plants,
    common with the lower animals, are endowed with sensation, or with any

property analogous to it.

               1.- Traces of Man in the Crag. By H. Stopes, F.G.8.

The prohahility of man having lived daring the Crag has heen suggested by

several (Charlesworth, &c.)

Many deny it, nearly all doubt it. Their evidence is chiefly negative. This

shell, from the Crag at Walton-on-the-Naze, now gives a positive to the negative

evidence ; and although it need not necessarily at once create belief in man's

remote being, it ought not to be lightly cast on one side. It was foimd in the

Crag, properly stratified (and not in the talus), by a gentleman having good know-

ledge of geology, who would not be unable to judge, or know the value, of marking

well all the surroundings and exact position of the shell. Owing to a dislike of

the effects of the discovery, he did not publish it at the time, and a little while ago

ogave the shell to me. The human face roughly cut upon it is of the rudest de-
scription, and is ve}y crude, thereby the more consistent. The shell is very abundant

at Walton. According to S. V. Wood, jun., the Walton Crag was deposited

under some depth of water ; not a beach as so much of the rest of the Red Crag.

Hence the possibility of the deposition of the shell without injury. It is bored

shell now cut shows white, and does not readily take the same colour. Without

attaching undue importance to this solitary specimen of early art, the author's

object in giving it prominence is that, should any other evidence occur to substan-

tiate the belief in Crag Man's existence, the find may be known and tend to confirm

the struggling belief in man's extreme antiqiuty.

2. The Besults of recent further Excavations in the Caves of Cefn, near St.

   Asaph, North Wales. By Professor T. McK. Hughes, M.A., and Mrs.
   "Williams Wtnn.

     The authors pointed out the evidence of the direction of the ice movement from
the higher mountains of North Wales during the period of extreme glaciation, and

refeiTed to this period the transport, over the western watersheds into the Vale of

Clwyd, of the felsites and other associated rocks which were made use of in the-
manufacture of the implements found in the caves, which, therefore, must all be

post-glacial.

     Thej' next draw attention to the later or marine drifts of the Clwyd VaUey,
which are composed chiefly of the dehris of the older drift, generally with all the
clay washed out ; but contain also granites from the north, flints which cannot
have been derived from any part of Wales, and marine shells, of which only a few

are arctic forms. These deposits, they pointed out, were obviously later than the
true glacial drift. They then described the mode of occurrence in the caves of

marine shells, in drift somewhat similar in appearance to the marine drift of the

Vale of  Clwyd                                    but showed that,  from its manner of         accumulation and associated

angular dehris, it was obviously washed in from above along fissm'es, and was not

carried in during the period of submergence. As this drift was in and over the

main mass of fossihferous cave-earth, they inferred that all the yet known remains

in the Cefn caves must be not only later than the period of extension of Snow-

donian ice into that area, but must be subsequent to the submergence that marked

the close of the period of gi-eat glaciation, and were even proved to be later than

the emergence that brought the marine drifts up within reach of subaerial denuda-

tion. Specimens from the collection of Mrs. Williams Wyna were exhibited in.

     This bronze, from the collection of the late Rev. S. Banks, was found near
Cottenham, north of Cambridge.

     The head was of the Marcus Aurelius type ; but the particular interest of the
object was in the helmet, which represented a human face, the character of which

exactly resembled that of the JDi/in// Gaul.

     These spears, brought by the Rev. S. Banks from China, were chiefly marked
by the deep rectangular, or angular, or rounded notch running up from the edge of
the socket to the position in which a rivet would be usually placed in such an
implement. The edge of the blade-portion was waved in some of the specimens.

S. On a supposed Inscribed Stone, near Llanerchymedd, in Anglesea.^
                        By Professor T. McK. Hughes, M.A.

     The author described a boulder standing in a field on the east of the Railway
between Plascoedana and Mynyddmawr, about a mile south of Llanerchymedd,
Anglesea. It is a portion of a mass of rock, in which two varieties of rock alternate.
There are also variations in structure in the rock, coinciding in direction, but not
·exactly in extent, with the varieties in texture.

     On the north side, as the stone lies, of the principal joints, the rock is cut
across by small joints at right angles to the principal joints and ending abruptly at
them. These are crossed obliquely by a less frequent and more irregular set. As

the weather has opened out these divisional planes to a small depth, the effect
 produced is that of a series of parallel lines, of uniform length, cut into the stone
along the edges, with here and there an oblique stroke, altogether bearing a strong

:superficial resemblance to the characters known as Oghams. As it is known that

-- --Runic characters are obscure in fact, quite unreadable except by experts local

talk has naturally placed the Mynyddmawr boulder among the inscribed stones of
 Wales. The joints to which the characters are due can, however, be traced into

 the portions of the boulder where a different texture and structure have caused a
·different weathering ; and a close examination shows that the supposed characters
 must be referred entirely to natural causes.

'C. On some late Celtic Engravings on a Slate Tablet, found at Towyn.

      This tablet was found, buried under drift sand, at Towyn, in Merionethshu-e, in
 1879. It is covered with incised figm-es representing, in outline, arms and objects
of domestic use. Several other relics were discovered at the same time, some of
·them associated with it, but not assisting materially in deciding the date of this
interesting tablet. Some of the hatchet-head forms, however, resemble so closely
iron axe-heads in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin, that if
we knew the date of the latter, it would go far to decide the question. But they
were found in cranoges of uncertain age. The ornamentation of the figiu-es
 on the tablet is clearly Celtic, and resembles, except in the rudeness of the execu-

funeral offering, representing objects which in earlier times it was the practice to

bury with deceased chiefs.'

7. On the Physical Characters and Proportions of the Zulus. By C. Roberts,
   F.B.G.S., and George "W. Bloxam, M.A., F.L.S., Assistant Secretary of

    the Anthropological Institute.

   A Committee, consisting of certain members of the Anthropological Institute

and of the Anthropometric Committee of the British Association, among whom

were Professor Flower, General Pitt-Rivers, Mr. F. Galton, and the authors,

made a carefid and exhaustive examination of the physical characters and
proportions of the Zulus exhibited at the Westminster Aquarium and in several

parts of this country during the last two years.
     Sixteen males and three females were examined, and from an hour to an hour

and a half was devoted to each indi^ddual.

The measurements were made by the authors with the greatest care and precision,,

and comprise 38 different dimensions of the body. The heights from the ground

were those of the vertex, the ear, the chin, the top of the sternum, the umbilicus,

the trochanters, the fork, the knee, and the largest part of the calf of the leg.

The breadths and circumferences of the trunk, the lengths and girths of the arms

and legs, and all the important dimensions of the head, face, and neck were also

recorded. In addition to these measurements, other points were noted, such as

the projection of the heel backwards, the relative length of the great and second

toe ; the colour of the skin, hair, and eyes ; the condition of the teeth, the
character of the features, the weight of the body, and the drawing strength of

the arm. Outlines of the feet were also talieu.

The various observations have been carefully tabulated, and the relative

proportions of the body have been calculated taking the stature as imity, and

represented, as is usual "in tables of this kind, by 1,000. The Zulus examined were

from the border-land between Natal and Zululand, and, although they had been

in contact with Europeans, were of pure Zulu race. Of this fact we were assured

by pei-sons who were well  acquainted  with  the  Zulus    in  their  own  country.                                            As.

                                                                                                                            _

they were brought to this country for the purpose of public exhibition, it is

probable  they  were  selected,  to  a certain extent, as  good specimens of  their  race
                                                                                                          ;

but as they were far from uniform in stature and physique, they may be accepted

as average" representatives of the Zulu tribes. Of the 16 males examined, one was

a boy of about 14 years of age, the remaining 15 being adiUts whose average age

was about 22^ years. Three women only having been examined, the measurements-

made were not sufficient to furnish trustworthy average results.
     The average stature of the 15 male adults was 170-7 centimetres, or 67-3

inches ; one-third of an inch less than the a-^erage Englishman of the same age.

The average chest-girth was 92 9 cm., or 3(5-5 inches ; one inch and a quarter
greater than the average Englishman of the same age. The average weight

(without clothes, for which 7 lbs. must be allowed) was 68-1 kilogrammes, or
151 lbs. ; about 10 lbs. greater than the average Englishman of the same age.
The average strength, as tested by the drawing power of the arm (as in drawing

a bow), was 38-7 kilos., or 85-6 lbs.; about 8 lbs. greater than that of the

average Englishman of the same age.
    Thus we see that while the stature of the Zulus was slightly below that of

Englishmen of the same age, the weight of the body was 10 lbs., the strength

8 lbs., and the chest-girth \\ inches, greater. It must be borne in mind, howe-i;er,
that the Zulus were kept in a condition of high physical training by their dancing
and spear-throwing exhibitions, while the Englishmen were those of the general

population of this country, following ordinary occupations. It must also be
remembeved that the chest-|?irtli and strength are, in a great measiu-e, dependent
on and related to the weight, and the greater weight of the Zulus accounts for
their great^- chest-girth and strength.

     With regard to the other physical characters noted, the heel was found to be
similar to that of Europeans in nine cases ; in six cases there was slight projection
backwards, and in four cases this peculiarity was well-marked.

     In only one case was the great toe found to be of the same length as the
second toe : in all the other cases the great toe was the longest.

     The coloiu- of the skin varied between a light chocolate and a dark bronze, ranging
through the shades of Broca's tests from No. 21 to No. 4.3.

     In all the cases the eyes were very dark: 17 cases corresponding to Broca's
test No. 1, and 2 to No. 2, and there was more or less pigmentation of thfr

conjunctiva in all, although in the case of the women this was very slifht.
There was also pigmentation of the mucous membrane of the mouth in all the men
except two, who were quite free from it, as were also the three women.

     Tlie hair was black, curly, and thick, and in three cases there was a slight
beard, and a little hair on the limbs, but in all the other cases the skin was smooth,
soft, and free from hair.

     The teeth were remarkably sound, regular, and well-shaped in all the cases

but of one, who showed some signs of caries. The lips were of varying thickness,

and resembling the negroid type in all cases except one, which approached the
European type. Jii seven cases the chin was small, and in only one case did the
prominent negroid chin appear. The noses were flat and broad, but less so than
those of the negroes of the West Coast of Africa.

     The ears were remarkably small and well-shaped, resembling the small ears

of the dark types of southern Europeans.

    Under examination the men were amiable and good-tempered, and displayed
a mild, sheepish disposition, strangely at variance vrith the fierceness of manner
assumed by them when performing before the public.

10. On the Profile of the Danes and Germans. By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

    Before anything can be done in the way of defining the racial peculiarities of
the people of the United Kingdom, we must ascertain, as far as possible, what
were the characteristics of the races, now forming our population, at the time

they landed on our coasts.  This  can, however, only be                                                                                                                                    done approximately                                                                              first,

by selecting types from districts in which there is reason to believe the inhabi-

tants iiave for centuries remained with least intermixture.                                                                                                                                It is believed that

much may, by such means, be learnt on the subject.

Confining the inquiry to Germany and Denmark in the first instance, we learn
from Scliadow, who wrote on the subject about fifty years ago, that the pure
German type showed, as a principal feature, a depressed nasaf bone, and, con-

sequently, a concave or incurved line from the root to near the nasal point,
where there was more or less of a bulb. In addition to this the face is described

as wide, and the forehead smooth                                                                                                                                                           the lower part of the face long.  The ear appears
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

to have been fine, with a well-formed but not heavy lobe ; the hair fair, and the

eyes blue. Tlie skulls from early graves are brachvcephalic.

Sussex, as seen in the ranks of the militia. It is also found in the remoter parts

of Surrey, and in other so-called Saxon counties. The same type prevails in the
country districts in Sweden, and is not uncommon in some parts of France.

    Now, the Danish profile (pure) presents a striking contrast to the above

type; though the skull is of the same, or nearly the same, width, and the
hair and eyes equally light. The forehead exhibits an apparent depression,
due to the prominence of the brow-ridges, which are more or less continuous.
The eye consequently has the appearance of being sunk. The nasal bone
rises well above an imaginary line drawn from the root to the tip of the

nose, and is often high. These features are found in a great majority of
the skulls preserved in the Nordisch Museum, and also in the tine collection of
the Royal College of Surgeons at Copenhagen, both obtained from early Danish

tumuli. Many persons in the streets of Copenhagen present these cranial cha-

racteristics : and they are found still more frequently in country places. In

addition to this, there "appears to be an equally well-marked contrast in the ear of

those Danes whose profiles approach most nearly to the early type. It consists,
amono-st other points, in a continuation of the channel or fossa (which exists in

all ears between the helix and the antihelix) quite up to the cheek. There is

consequently no proper lobe, though many Danes, through mixture with Swedes

and Germans, have, like the majority of English, a composite or uncertain kind

of lobe. The lips are thin.
     The same characteristics are recognisable in the inhabitants of Schleswig and

Holstein, where one frequently meets with the Danish termination sen. They
are met with also, though not so strongly marked (except in a few cases), in
Beloium, where the patronj-mic is abbreviated, as in AVales and many parts of

England.
     The type is found in various districts in the United Kingdom. Indeed, it is

spread over so large an area that, for this and other reasons, the opinion that is

now received by the most eminent anthropologists in Paris and in this country

  --that the Belg?e and the Cymri were Celtic tribes, requires the supplement
--(which M. Hovelacque considers perfectly scientific) that the Danes were a

tribe of the Cymri. Certainly it is time to put aside the view that the Celtic
race is dark. It is not so in Ireland, Scotland, or France, except where there is
a strong infusion of Iberian blood, which would not have altered the profile.
In the Principality the Cymric type still exists in comparative purity, and is fair.

      Danish skulls" in the "possession of Dr. Eraser at Dublin, obtained by himself
from a battle-field in the neighbom-hood of that city, exhibit precisely the same

peculiarities as the crania in the museums at Copenhagen. Two skulls, presented

By Professor B. Dawkins to the Welshpool Museum, and labelled ' Danish,' are in
 every respect similar. Also several dredged up from the bed of the Ouse, in the
museum at York, exhibit the same characteristics. Others, found in the hollowed
 trunks of trees, and supposed to be Anglian, present the same ci-auial features,
thouo-h in a modified degree. In the Scarborough Museum there is a skeleton

from a neighbouring barrow that might be considered Danish were it not that the

 objects associated with it point to a British intei-ment.

     Now the majority of skulls collected by Canon Greenwell from the round

 barrows of Yorkshire, so closely resemble early Danish crania that he has ai-rived,
 quite independently, at the conclusion that the fair-haired Briton and the early
 Dane were allied in blood. In other words, that the Danes proper were in race a

Celtic, and not a Teutonic people.

     This skull which was exhibited, was found some years ago in the neighbour-
hood of York. It is very much elongated, and compressed at the sides. The
sagittal suture is entirely obliterated, and its place supplied by an elevated ridge
of dense bone. The bones of the skull are very thick and heavy. The author thinks it

probable that the sagittal suture was ancliylosed very early in the development
of the skull, and this circumstance would cause the skull to lengthen, to allow the
<?rowth of the brain to take place. The coronal and lambdoidal sutures are well-
developed. The skull will come under the class of Scaphocepbalic Crania. The
tubercles of the teeth are worn smooth, as is the case with the teeth in many of the

Homan skulls found near York. From the peculiarity of the teeth, and the skull
liaving been found along with Eoman remains, it is probably a Roman skull.

       FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

The Chairman delivered the following Address :

The Discoveries of the past Half-Century relating to Animal Motion.

The two great branches of Biology with which we concern ourselves in this Section,

Animal Morphology and Physiology, are most intimately related to each other.

--This arises from their having one subject of study the living animal organism.

The difference between them lies in this, that whereas the studies of the anatomist

lead him to fix bis attention on the organism itself, to us physiologists it, and the

organs of which it is made up, serve only as vestigia, by means of which we investi-

gate the vital processes of which they are alike the causes and consequences.

     To illustrate this I will first ask you to imagine for a moment that you have

--before you one of those melancholy remainders of what was once an animal to wit, a
Werabbit--which one sees t-xposed in the shops of poulterers.
                                                               have no hesitatioH

in recognising that remainder as being in a certain sense a rabbit ; but it is a very

miserable vestige of what was a few days ago enjoying life in some wood or warren,

Weor more likely on the sand-hills near Ostend.    may call it a rabbit if we like,

--but it is only a remainder not the thing itself

The anatomical preparntion which I have in imagination placed before you,

although it has lost its inside and its outside, its integument and its viscera, still

retains the parts for which the rest existed. The final cause of an animal,

whether human or other, is muscular action, because it is by means of its muscles

that it maintains its external relations. It is by our muscles exclusively that we

act on each other. The articulate sounds by which I am addressing you are but

--the results of complicated combinations of muscular contractions and so are the

scarcely appreciable changes in your countenances by which I am able to judge
how much, or how little, what I am saying inteiests you.

     Consequently the main problems of physiolngy relate to muscular action, or, as

--I have called it, animal motion. Thev may be divided into two namely ( 1 J in

--what does muscular action consist that is, what is the process of which it is th&

efi'ect or outcome ? and (2) how are the motions of our bodies co-ordinated or

regulated ? It is unnecessary to occupy time in showing that, excluding those
higher intellectual processes which, as they leave no traceable marks behind them,
are beyond the reach of our methods of investigation, these two questions comprise

--all others concerning animal motion. I will therefore proceed at once to the first

of them that of the process of muscular contraction.
     The years which immediately followed the origin of the British Association

exceeded any earlier period of equal length in the number and importance of the
new facts in morphology and in physiology which were brought to light ; for it
was during that period that Johannes Mliller, Schwann, Henle, and, in this country,

--Sharpey, Bowman, and Marshall Hall, accomplished their productive labours. But

it was introductory to a much greater epoch the greatest, I venture to say,

beyond comparison, which has occurred in the history of Biology since that of the
discovery of the circulation of the blood. It would give you a true idea of the nature
of the great advance which took place about the middle of this century if I were to

--define it as the epoch of the death of ' vitalism.' Before that time, even the greatest

biologists e.ff. J. Mliller recognised that the knowledge biologists possessed

both of vital and physical phenomena was insufficient to refer both to a common
measure. The method, therefore, was to study the processes of life in relation to each

other only. Since that time it has become fundamental in our science not to regard

any vital process as understood at all, unless it can be brought into relation with
physical standards, and the methodsof physiology have been based exclusively on this

principle. Let us inquire for a moment what causes have conduced to the change.
     The most efficient cause was the progress which had been made in physics and

chemistry, and particularly those investigations which led to the establishment of

the doctrine of the Conservation of Energy. In the application of this great

principle to physiology the men to whom we are indebted are, first and fore-

most, J.  R. Mayer,  of  whom  I  shall  say  more  immediately                                                                and  secondly,  the

--great physiologists still living and working among us, who were tbe pupils of

J. Miiller viz., Helmholtz, Ludwig, du Bois-Reymond, and Briicke.

As regards the subject which is first to occupy our attention, that of the

process of muscular contraction, J. R. Mayer occupies so leading a position that

a large proportion of the researches whicb have been done since the new era,

which he had so important a share in establishing, may be rightly considered as

the working out of principles enunciated in his treatise ' on the relation between

organic motion and exchange of material. The most important of these were

as expressed in his own words, (1) ' That the chemical force contained in the

ingested food and in the inhaled oxygen is the source of the motion and heat

which are the two products of animal life ; and (2) that these products vary in

amoimt with the chemical process which produces them.' Whatever may be the

claims of Mayer to be regarded as a great discoverer in physics, there can be no

doubt that as a physiologist he deserves the highest place that we can give him,

for at a time when the notion of the correlation of different modes of motion was

as yet very unfamiliar to the physicist, he boldly applied it to the phenomena of

animal life, and thus re-united physiology with natural philosophy, from which it

had been rightly, because unavoidably, severed by the vitalists of an earlier

period.

    Let me first endeavour shortly to explain how Mayer himself applied the
principle just enunciated, and then how it has been developed experimentally

since his time.

     The fundamental notion is this : the animal body resembles, as regards the
work it does and the heat it produces, a steam engine, in which fuel is continually
being used on the one hand, and work is being done and heat produced on the
other. The using of fuel is the chemical process, which in the animal body, as in
the steam-engine, is a process of oxidation. Heat and work are the useful products,

 for as, in the higher animals, the body can only -work at a constant temperature of

about 100° Fahr., heat may be so regarded.

      Having previously determined the heat and work severally producible by the
combustion of a given weight of carbon, from his own experiments and from those of
 earlier physicists, Mayer calculated that if the oxidation of carbon is assumed to

 represent approximately the oxidation-process of the body, the quantity of carbon
 actually burnt in a day is far more than sufficient to account for the day's work,
and that of the material expended in the body not more than one-fifth was used
 in the doing of work, the remaining four-fifths being partly used, partly wasted, in
 heat-production.

      Having thus shown that the principles of the correlation of process and product
hold good, so far as its truth could then be tested, as regards the whole organism,
Mayer proceeded to inquire into its applicability to the particular organ
whose function it is ' to transform chemical difterence into mechanical effect '
namely, muscle. Although, he said, a muscle acts under the direction of the will,
it does not derive its power of acting from the will any more than a steamboat
derives its power of motion from the helmsman. Again (and this was of more im-
portance, as being more directly opposed to the prevalent vitalism), a muscle, like

--the steamboat, uses, in the doing of work, not the material of its own structure or

mechanism, but the fuel i.e., the nutriment which it derives directly from the
 blood which flows through its capillaries. 'The muscle is the instrument by
which the transformation of force is accomplished, not the material which is itself

transformed.' This principle he exemplified in several ways, showing that if the
muscles of our bodies worked, as was formerly supposed, at the expense of their

own substance, their whole material would be used up in a few weeks, and that in

--the case of the heart, a muscle which works at a much greater rate than any other,

it would be expended in as many days a result which necessarily involved the

absurd hypothesis that the muscular fibres of our hearts are so frequently disin-

tegrated and reintegrated that we get new hearts once a week.
     On such considerations Mayer founded the prevision, that, as soon as experi-

mental methods should become sufficiently perfect to render it possible to deter-
mine with precision the limits of the chemical process either in the whole animal
body or in a single muscle during a given period, and to measure the production
of heat and the work done during the same period, the result would show a quanti-
tative correlation between them.

      If the time at our disposal permitted, I should like to give a short account of
the succession of laborious investigations by which these previsions have been veri-

fied. Begun by Bidder and Schmidt in 1851,i continued by Pettenkofer and Voit,*
and by the agricultural physiologists ' with reference to herbivora, they are not
yet by any means completed. I must content myself with saying that by
these experiments the first and second parts of this" great subject--namely, the
limits of the chemical process of animal life and its relation to animal motion
under different conditions-- have been satisfactorily worked out, but that the quan-

titative relations of heat-production are as yet only insufficiently determined.

     Let me sum up in as few words as possible how far what we have now learnt
by experiment, justifies Mayer's anticipations, and how far it falls short of or ex-
ceeds them. First of all, we are as certain as of any physical fact that the animal

--body in doing work does not use its own material that, as Mayer says, the oil to

his lamp of life is food ; but in addition to this we know, what he was unaware
of, that what is used is not only not the living protoplasm itself, but is a kind of
material which widely differs from it in chemical properties. In what may be

called commercial physiology i.e. in the literature of trade puffs-- one still meets
with the assumption that the material basis of muscular motion is nitrogenous

but by many methods of proof it has been shown that the true * Oel in der Flamme
des Lebens ' is not proteid substance, but sugar, or sugar-producing material. The

discovery of this fundamental truth we owe first to Bernard (1850-56), who l)rouglit

to lio-ht the fact that such material plays an important part in the nutrition of

every living tissue ; secondly, to Voit (1866), who in elaborate experiments on

carnivorous animals, during periods of rest and exertion, showed that, in com-

paring those conditions, no relation whatever shows itself between the quantity
of proteid material (flesh) consumed, and the amount of work done; and finally

to Frankland, Fick and his associate "Wislicenus, as to the work-yielding value

of different constituents of food, and as to the actual expenditure of material in

man during severe exertion. The subjects of experiment used by the two last-

mentioned physiologists were themselves; the work done was the mountain

ascent  from  Interlaken to  the  summit of the  Faulhorn                                        the result was to prove
                                                                                              ;

that the quantity of material used was proportional to the work done, and that

chat material was such as to yield water and carbonic acid exclusively.

    The investigators to whom I have just referred aimed at proving the correla-

tion of process and product for the whole animal organism. The other mode of

inquiry proposed by Mayer, the verification of his principle in respect of the work-

-- --doing mechanism that is to say, in respect of muscle taken separately has been

pursued with equal perseverance during the last twenty years, and with greater

success ; for in experimenting on a separate organ, which has no other functions

excepting those which are in question, it is possible to eliminate uncertainties

which are unavoidable when the conditions of the problem are more complicated.

Before I attempt to sketch the results of these experiments, 1 must ask your atten-

tion for a moment to the discoveries made since Mayer's epoch, concerning a closely

related subject, that of the Process of Respiration.

I wish that I had time to go back to the great discovery of Priestley (1776), that

the essential facts in the process of respiration are the giving off of fixed air, as he

called it, and the taking in of dephlogisticated air, and to relate to you the beautiful

experiments by which he proved it; and then to pass on to Lavoisier (1777), who,

on the other side of the Channel, made independently what was substantially the

same discovery a little after Priestley, and added others of even greater moment. Ac-

cording to Lavoisier, the chemical process of respiration is a slow combustion which

has its seat in the lungs. At the time that Mayer wrote, this doctrine still main-

tained its ascendancy, although the investigations of Magnus (1838) had already
proved its fallacy. Mayer himself knew that the blood possessed the property of con-

veying oxygen from the lungs to the capillaries, and of conveying carbonic acid gas

from the capillaries to the lungs, which was sufficient to exclude the doctrine of

Lavoisier. Our present knowledge of the subject was attained by two methods

viz. first, the investigation of the properties of the colouring matter of the blood,

since called ' haemoglobin,' the initial step in which was made by Professor Stokes

in 1862 ; and secondly, the application of the mercurial air-pump as a means of

determining the relations of oxygen and carbonic acid gas to the living blood and

tissues. The last is a matter of such importance in relation to our subject that I

shall ask your special attention to it. Suppose that 1 have a barometer, of which

the tube, instead of being of the ordinary form, is expanded at the top into a large

bulb of one or two litres capacity, and that, by means of some suitable contrivance,

I am able to introduce, in such a way as to lose no time and to preclude the possi-

--bility of contact with air, a fluid ounce of blood from the artery of a living animal

into the vacuous space what would happen ? Instantly the quantity of blood

would be converted into froth, which would occupy the whole of the large bulb.

The colour of the froth would at first be scarlet, but would speedily change to

crimson. It would soon subside, and we should then have the cavity which was

--before vacuous occupied by the blood and its gases namely, the oxygen, carbonic

acid gas, and nitrogen previously contained in it. And if we had the means (which

actually exist in the gas-pump) of separating the gaseous mixture from the liquid,

and of renewing the vacuum, we should be able to determine (1) the total quantity

of gases which the blood yields, and (2), by analysis, the proportion of each gas.

Now, with reference to the blood, by the application of the ' blood-pump,' as it

is called, we have learnt a great many facts relating to the nature of respira-

tion, particularly that the difference of venous from arterial blood depends not on
                                                                             ----

the presence of ' effete matter,' as used to be thought, but on the less amount of

oxygen held by its colouring matter, and that the blood which flows back to the

heart from different organs, and at different times, differs in the amount of oxyuen

and of carbonic acid gas it yields, according to the activity of the chemicarpro-

cesses which have their seat in the living tissues from which it flows." But this

is not all that the blood-pump has done for us. By applying it not merely to the

blood, but to the tissues, we have learnt that the doctrine of Lavoisier was wrnnc

not merely as regards the place, but as regards the nature of the essential process

in respiration. The fundamental fact which is thus brought to light is this, that

although living tissues are constantly and freely supplied with oxygen, and are

in fact constantly tearing it from the hsemoglobiu which holds it, yet they them-

selves yield no oxygen to the vacuum. In other words, the oxygen which living

protoplasm seizes upon with such energy that the blood which flows by it is

compelled to yield it up, becomes so entirely part of the living material itself that

it cannot be separated even by the vacuum. It is in this way only that we can

understand the seeming paradox that the oxygen, which is conveyed in abundance

to every recess of our bodies by the blood-stream, is nowhere to be found. Not-

withstanding that no oxidation-product is formed, it becomes latent in every bit of

living protoplasm ; stored up in quantity proportional to its potential activity i.e.

, to the work, internal or external, it has to do.

    --Thus you see that the process of tissue-respiration in other words, the relation

  --of living protoplasm to oxygen is very different from what Mayer, who localised

oxidation in the capillaries, believed it to be. And this difference has a good deal to

do with the relation of Process to Product in muscle. Let us now revert to the

experiments on this subject which we are to take as exemplification of the truth

of Mayer's forecasts.

The living muscle of a frog is placed in a closed chamber, which is vacuous

i.e. contains only aqueous vapour. The chamber is so arranged that the muscle

can be made to contract as often as necessary. At the end of a certain period it

is found that the chamber now contains carbonic acid gas in quantity correspond-

ing to the number of contractions the muscle has performed. The water which

it has also given off cannot of course be estimated. Where do these two products

come from ? The answer is plain. The muscle has been living all the time, for

it has been doing work, and (as we shall see immediately) producing heat. What

has it been living on? Evidently on stored material. If so, of what nature .P
If we look for the answer to the muscle, we shall find that it contains both proteid

and sugar-producing material, but which is expended in contraction we are not

Weinformed. There is, however, a way out' of the difficulty.  have seen that

the only chemical products which are given off' during contraction are carbonic

acid gas and water. It is clear, therefore, that the material on which it feeds
must be something which yields, when oxidised, these products, and these only.
The materials which are stored in muscle are oxygen and sugar, or something

resembling it in chemical composition.

And now we come to the last point I have to bring before you in connection

my"With this part of   subject.  I have assumed up  to this moment that heat is

always produced when a muscle does work. Most people will be ready to admit

as evidence of this, the familiar fact that we warm ourselves by exertion. This is

in reality no proof at all.

The proof is obtained when, a muscle being set to contract, it is observed that at

each contraction it becomes warmer. In such an experiment, if the heat-capacity of

muscle is known, the weight of the particular muscle, and the increase of tempera-

ture, we have the quantity of heat produced.

If you determine these data in respect of a series of contractions, arranging

the experiments so that the work done in each contraction is measured, and

immediately thereupon reconverted into heat, the result gives you the total pro-

duct of the oxidation-process in heat.

If you repeat the same experiment in such a way that the work done in

each contraction is not so reconverted, the result is less by the quantity of heat

corresponding to the work done. The results of these two experiments have been

found hy Professor Fick to cover each other very exactly. I have stated them in a

table/ in which we have the realisation as regards a single muscle of the following

forecast of Mayer's as regards the whole animal organism. ' Convert into heat,'

he said, ' by friction or otherwise, the mechanical product yielded by an animal in a

given time, add thereto the heat produced in the body directly during the same

period, and you will have the total quantity of heat which corresponds to the

Wechemical processes.'  have seen that this is realisable as regards muscle, but it is

not even yet within reach of experimental verification as regards the whole animal.

    I now proceed abruptly (for the time at our disposal does not admit of our

spending it on transitions) to the consideration of the other great question con-

cerning vital motion, namely the question how the actions of the muscles of an

animal are so regulated and co-ordinated as to determine the combined movements,

whether rhythmical or voluntary, of the whole body.

As everyone knows who has read the ' Lay Sermons,' the nature and meaning

of these often unintentional but always adapted motions, which constitute so large

a part of our bodily activity, was understood by Descartes early in the seventeenth

century. "Without saying anything as to his direct influence on his contemporaries

--and successors, there can be no doubt that the appearance of Descartes was co-

incident with a great epoch an epoch of great men and great achievements in

the acquirement of man's intellectual mastery over nature. When he interpreted

the unconscious closing of the eyelids on the approach of external objects, the

acts of coughing, sneezing, and the like, as mechanical and reflected processes, he

neither knew in what part of the nervous system the mechanisms concerned were
situated, nor how they acted. '^ It was not until a hundred years after, that Whytt

and Hales made the fundamental experiments on beheaded frogs, by which they

         * Descartes' scheme of the central nervous mechanism, comprised all the parts
   which we now regard as essential to ' reflex action.' Sensory nerves were represented
   by threads (iilets) which connected all parts of the body to the brain ( (Euvres, par
    V. Cousin, vol. iv. p. 359) ; motor nerves by tubes which extended from the brain to
    the muscles ; 'motor centres' by 'pores' which were arranged on the internal surface
    of the ventricular cavity of the brain and guarded the entrances to the motor tubes.
    This cavity was supposed to be kept constantly charged with ' animal spirits,' fur-

   nished to it from the heart by arteries specially destined for the purpose. Any

    ' incitation ' of the surface of the body by an external object which affects the organs
    of sense does so, according to Descartes, by producing a motion at the incited part.
    This is communicated to the pore by the thread and causes it to open, the conse-
· quence of which is that the 'animal spirits' contained in the ventricular cavity
     enter the tube and are conveyed by it to the various muscles with which it is con-
     nected, so as to produce the appropriate motions. The whole system, although it
     was placed under the supervision of the ' dine faisonnahle ' which had its office in the
     pineal gland, was capable of working independently. As instances of this mechanism
     Descartes gives the withdrawal of the foot on the approach of hot objects, the

     actions of swallowing, yawning, coughing, &c. As it is necessary that in the per-
     formance of these complicated motions, the muscles concerned should contract in
     succession, provision is made for this in the construction of the systems of tubes
     which represent the motor nerves. The weakness of the scheme lies in the absence

     of fact basis. Neither threads nor pores nor tubes have any existence.

 showed that the involuntary motion which such preparations execute ceases when

--the whole of the spinal chord is destroyed that if the back part of the chord is

 destroyed, the motions of the hind limbs, if the fore part, those of the fore limbs

 cease. It was in 1751 that Dr. Whytt published in Edinburgh his work on the in-
 voluntary motions of animals. After this the next great step was made within

 the recollection of living physiologists ; a period to which, as it coincided with

--the event which we are now commemorating the origin of the British Association
--I will now ask your special attention.

      Exactly forty-nine years ago Dr. Marshall Hall communicated to the Zoological
Society of London the first account of his experiments on the reflex function of
the spinal chord. The facts which he had observed, and the conclusions he drew

from them, were entirely new to him, and entirely new to the-physiologists to whom
his communication was addressed. Nor can there be any reason why the anticipa-

tion of his fundamental discovery by Dr. Whytt should be held to diminish his

merit as an original investigator. In the face of historical fact, it is impos-
sible to regai'd him as the discoverer of the ' i-e'flex function of the spinal chord,'

but we do not the less owe him gratitude for the application he made of the

knowledge he had gained by experiments on animals to the study of disease. For

no one who is acquainted with the development of the branch of practical medicine

which relates to the diseases of the central nervous system, will hesitate in
attributing the rapid progress which has been made in the diagnosis and treatment
of these diseases, to the impulse given by Dr. Marshall Hail to the study of nervous

pathology.

     In the mind of Dr. Marshall Hall the word reflex had a very restricted
meaning. The term ' excito-motory function,' which he also used, stood in his
mind for a group of phenomena of which it was the sole characteristic that a
sensory impression produced a motor response. During the thirty years which
have elapsed since his death the development of meaning of the word reflex has
been comparable to that of a plant from a seed. The original conception of

reflex action has undergone, not only expansion, but also modification, so that in its

wider sense it may be regarded as the empirical development of the philosophical

views of the animal mechanism promulgated by Descartes. Not that the work of
the past thirty years by which the physiology of the nervous system has been con-
stituted, can be attributed for a moment to the direct influence of Descartes. The
real epochmaker here was Johannes Miiller. There can be no doubt that Descartes'
physiological speculations were well known to him, and that bis large acquaintance
with the thought and work of his predecessors conduced, with his own powers of

observation, to make him the great man that he was ; but to imagine that his

ideas of the mechanism of the nervous system were inspired, or the investiga-
tions, by which, contemporaneously with Dr. Marshall Hall, he demonstrated the
fundamental facts of reflex action, were suggested by the animal automatism

of Descartes, seem to me wholly improbable.
     I propose, by way of conclusion, to attempt to illustrate the nature of reflex

action in the larger sense, or, as I should prefer to call it, the Automatic Action

--of Centres, by a single example that of the nervous mechanism by which the cir-

culation is regulated.

     The same year that J. R. Mayer published his memorable essay, it was dis-
covered by E. H. "Weber that, in the vagus nerve, which springs from the medulla
oblongata and proceeds therefrom to the heart, there exist channels of influence by
which the medulla acts on that wonderful muscular mechanism. Almost at the
same time with this, a series of discoveries' were made relating to the circulation,

     ' The dates of the discoveries relating to this subject here referred to are as

which, taken together, must be regarded as of equal importance with the original

discovery of Harvey. First, it was found by Henle that the arterial blood-vessels

by which blood is distributed to brain, nerve, muscle, gland, and other or^-ans, are

provided with muscular walls like those of the heart itself, by the contraction or

dilatation of which the supply is increased or diminished according to the require-

ments of the particular organ. Secondly, it was discovered simultaneously, but

independently, by Brown-Sequard and Augustus Waller, that these arteries are

connected by nervous channels of influence with the brain and spinal cord, just as
the heart is. Thirdly, it was demonstrated by Bernard, that what may be called

the heart-managing channels spring from a small spot of grey substance in the

medulla oblongata, which we now call the ' heart-centre ' ; and a little later by

Schiff', that the artery-regulating channels spring from a similar head-central office,

also situated in the medulla oblongata, but higher up, and from subordinate cen-

tres in the spinal cord.

    If I had the whole day at my disposal and your patience were inexhaustible,

I might attempt to give an outline of the issues to which these five discoveries'

have led. As it is, I must limit myself to a brief discussion of their relations to
each other, in order that we may learn something from them as to the nature of

automatic action.

     Sir Isaac Newton, who although he knew nothing about the structure of nei'ves,

made some shrewd forecasts about their action, attributed to those which are con-

nected with muscles an alternative function. He thought that by means of motor

Nownerves the brain could determine either relaxation or contraction of muscles.

Weas regards ordinary muscles we know that this is not the case.                                  can will only

the shortening of a muscle, not its lengthening. When Brown-S^quard dis-

covered the function of the motor nerves of the blood-vessels, he assumed that the

same limitation was applicable to it as to that of muscular nerves in general. It

--was soon found, however, that this assumption was not true in all cases that there

were certain instances in which, when the vascular nerves were interfered with,

dilatation of the blood-vessels, consequent on relaxation of their muscles, took place

and that, in fact, the nervous mechanism by which the circulation is regulated is a
highly-complicated one, of which the best that we can say is that it is perfectly

adapted to its purpose. For while every organ is supplied with muscular arteries,

and every artery with vascular nerves, the influence which these transmit is here

relaxing, there constricting, according (1) to the function which the organ is called
upon to discharge : and (2) the degree of its activity at the time. At the same time
the whole mechanism is controlled by one and the same central office, the locality

of which we can determine with exactitude by experiment on the living animal,

notwithstanding that its structure affords no indication whatever of its fitness for

the function it is destined to fulfil. To judge of the complicated nature of this
function we need only consider that in no single organ of the body is the supply of

blood required always the same. The brain is during one hour hard at work,

during the next hour asleep ; the muscles are at one moment in severe exercise, the

next  in  complete  repose                                 the  liver, which before  a  meal  is  inactive, during  the

process of digestion is turgid with blood, and busily engaged in the chemical work

which belongs to it. For all these vicissitudes the tract of grey substance which

we call the vascular centre has to provide. Like a skilful steward of the animal

household, it has, so to speak, to exercise perfect and unfailing foresight, in order

that the nutritive material which serves as the oil of life, for the maintenance of

each vital process, may not be wanting. The fact that this wonderful function is

localised in a particular bit of grey substance is what is meant by the expression

' automatic action of a centre.'

    But up to this point we have looked at the subject from one side only.
    No state ever existed of which the administration was exclusively executive
no government which was, if I may be excused the expression, absolutely absolute.
If in the animal organism we impose on a centre the responsibility of govern-
ing a particular mechanism or process, independently of direction from above, we

must give that centre the means of being itself influenced by what is going on in

all parts of its area of government. In other words, it is as essential that there
--

should be channels of information passing inwards, as that there should be channels

Nowof influence passing outwards.  what is the nature of these channels of infor-

mation i^ Experiment has taught us not merely with reference to the regulation

of the circulation, but with reference to all other automatic mechanisms, that they

are as various in their adaptation as the outgoing channels of influence. Thus the

vascular centre in the medulla oblongata is so cognisant of the chemical condition

of the blood which flows thi'ough it, that if too much carbonic acid gas is contained

in it, the centre acts on information of the fact, so as to increase the velocity of the

blood-stream, and so promote the arterial! sation of the blood. Still more strikingly

is this adaptation seen in the arrangement by which the balance of pressure and

resistance in the bloodvessels is regulated. The heart, that wonderful muscular

--machine by which the circulation is maintained, is connected with the centre, as

if by two telegraph wires one of which is a channel of influence, the other of

information. By the latter, the engineer who has charge of that machine sends

information to headquarters whenever the strain on his machine is excessive,

the certain response to which is relaxation of the arteries and diminution of

pressure. By the former, he is enabled to adapt its rate of working to the work it

has to do.

· \^^ ^^' ^''^y^^' instead of cutting ofl' the head of his frog, had removed only

--its brain i.e. the organ of thought and consciousness he would have been more
astonished than he actually was at the result ; for a frog so conditioned exhibits as
regards its bodily movements as perfect adaptedness as a normal frog. But very

little careful observation is suflBcient to show the difference. Being incapable of

the simplest mental acts, this true animal automaton has no notion of requiring

food or of seeking it, has no motive for moving from the place it happens to
occupy, emits no utterance of pleasure or distress. Its life-processes continue so

long as material remains, and are regulated mechanically.

      '-° "'^"^'stand this all that is necessaiy is to extend the considerations which
 have been suggested to us in our very cursory study of the nervous mechanism
 by which the working of the heart and of arteries is governed, to those of loco-

motion and voice. Both of these we know, on experimental evidence similar to

that which enables us to localise the vascular centre, to be regulated by a centre
of the same kind. If the behaviour of the brainless frog is so natural "that even

the careful and intelligent observer finds it difficult to attribute it to anything less
than intelhgence, let us ask ourselves whether the chief reason of the difficulty-
does not he in this, that the motions in question are habitually performed intelli-
gently and consciously. Kegarded as mere mechanisms, those of locomotion are no
doubt more complicated than those of respiration or circulation, but the diflerence is

one ot degree, not of kind. And if the respiratory movements are so controlled and

regulated by the automatic centre which governs them, that they adapt themselves

pertectly to the varying requirements of the organism, there is no reason why we

should hesitate in attributing to the centres which preside over locomotion powers
which are somewhat more extended.

    But perhaps the question has already presented itself to your minds. What does

to show you in                always proportional to Process, and (2), as I have endeavoured

                             the second part of my discourse, that Descartes' dream of animal
automatism has been realised, what have we learnt thereby ? Is it true that the
work of the last generation is worth more than that of preceding ones ?

      It 1 only desired to convince you that during the last half-century there has
been a greater accession of knowledge about the function of the living organism
than during the previous one, I might arrange here in a small heap at one end

ot the table the physiological works of the Hunters, Spallanzani, Fontana,
Ihomas Young, Benjamin Brodie, Charles Bell, and others, and then proceeding to
cover the rest of it with the records of original research on physiological subjects
since 1831, I should find that, even if I included only genuine work, I should

bave to heap my table up to the ceiling. But I apprehend this would not give us a

true answer to our question. Although etymologically, Science and Knowledge

mean the same thing, their real meaning is different. By science we mean, first
714 REPORT-- 1881.

of all, that knowledge -wliich enables us to sort the things known according to their
true relations. On this ground we call Haller the father of phj'siology, because,

regardless of existing theories, he brought together into a system, all that

was then known by observation or experiment as to the processes of the

living body. But in the ' Elementa Physiologic' we have rather that out of

which science springs than science itself. Science can hardly be said to begin

until we have by experiment acquired such a knowledge of the relation between

events and their antecedents, between processes and their products, that, in our

own sphere, we are able to forecast the operations of nature, even when they lie

beyond the reach of direct observation. I would accordingly claim for physiology

a place in the sisterhood of the sciences, not because so large a number of new

facts have been brought to light, but because she has in her measure acquired

that gift of prevision which has been long enjoyed by the higher branches of

·natural philosophy. In illustration of this, I have endeavoured to show you that

every step of the laborious investigations undertaken during the last thirty

years as to the process of nutrition, has been inspired by the previsions of J. R.

Mayer, and that what we have learnt with so much labour by experiments on

animals is but the realisation of conceptions which existed 200 years ago in the

mind of Descartes as to the mechanism of the nervous system. If I wanted

another example I might find it in the previsions of Dr. Thomas Young as to the

mechanism of the circulation, which for thirty years were utterly disregarded,

until at the epoch to which I have so often adverted, they received their full

justification from the experimental investigations of Ludwig.

But perhaps it will occur to some one that if physiology founds her claim to be

regarded as a science on her power of anticipating the results of her own experi-

ments, it is unnecessary to make experiments at all. Although this objection has

been frequently heard lately from certain persons who call themselves philosophers,

it is not very likely to be made seriously here. The answer is, that it is contrary

to experience. Although we work in the certainty that every experimental result

will come out in accordance with great principles (such as the principle that every

plant or animal is, both as regards form and function, the outcome of its past and

present conditions, and that in every vital process the same relations obtain be-

tween expenditure and product as hold outside of the organism), these principles

do little more for us than indicate the direction in which we are to proceed. The
history of science teaches us that a general principle is like a ripe seed, which may

remain useless and inactive for an indefinite period, until the conditions favourable

to its germination come into existence. Thus the conditions for which the theory

of animal automatism of Descartes had to wait two centuries, were (1 ) the acquire-

ment of an adequate knowledge of the structure of the animal organism, and (2)
the development of the sciences of physics and chemistry ; for at no earlier moment

were these sciences competent to furnish either the knowledge or the methods

necessary  for its  experimental  realisation                                                 and for  a  reason  precisely  similar Young's
                                                                                           ;

theory of the circulation was disregarded for thirty years.

I trust that the examples I have placed before you to-day may have been

sufficient to show that the investigators who are now working with such earnest-

ness in all parts of the world for the advance of physiology, have before them a

definite and well-understood purpose, that purpose being to acquire an exact know-

ledge of the chemical and physical processes of animal life, and of the self-acting

machinery by which they are regulated for the general good of the organism.

The more singly and straightforwardly we direct our efforts to these ends, the

--sooner we shall attain to the still higher purpose the effectual application of our

knowledge for the increase of human happiness.

The Science of Physiology has already afforded her aid to the Art of Medicine

in furnishing her with a vast store of knowledge obtained by the experimental

investigation of the action of remedies and of the causes of disease. These

investigations are now being carried on in all parts of the world with great

diligence, so that we may confidently anticipate that during the next generation

the progress of pathology will be as rapid as that of physiology has been in the

j)a5t, and that as time goes on the practice of medicine will gradually come more

and more under the influence of scientific knowledge. That this change is already

process, for we may be quite sure that, as soon as science is competent to dictate,

art will be ready to obey.

     The following Papers were read :

                    1. On the Development of the Golour- sense.
                                By Dr. Montagu Lubbock.

     The author remarked that this was a subject which had only been discussed
within the last five and twenty years. Mr. Gladstone was the first to open this
question, his studies of the Homeric poems leading him to remark how few colom'S
were mentioned by that poet, and how inexactly the colour-terms were used.
This Mr. Gladstone accounted for, in his ' Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age,'
published" in 1858, by supposing that Homer's perceptions of colour were vague
and indeterminate, owing to the organ of colour and its impressions being
but partially developed among the Greeks of his age.

     The author then stated that the object of the paper was to discuss the question
whether there was evidence to show that the power of perceiving colour had been

gradually acquired, not only by man in historic or prehistoric times, but by the

animal kingdom at large.
     The first explained briefly the meaning of the term ' Colour Sense,' or

' Perception of Colour,' observing that Newton first showed the white light of the
sun to be formed of seven colours ; that these seven colom-s could be observed
separately, and in a certain definite order, if the white light of the sun was
decomposed by means of a prism, and that mankind had been supposed to acquire

perception of the different colours in the order of the colours of the solar spectrum.

     The author observed that colour-blindness had been supposed to be a return

to the primitive condition of vision in mankind, but that since red-colom:-blindness
was the usual form of that complaint, whereas red was supposed to be the first
colour seen by man, there were no grounds for this supposition.

     The author then recalled what had been already written on this subject.
Mr. Gladstone had fii-st opened the subject, as already stated, Lazarus Geiger
having been the next to take up the question, in a paper read at Frankfort-on-the-
Maine in 1867. Geiger believed the power of percei\ang colour to have been
gradually acquired, and that even within historic times. Neither in the Vedas of
the Hindus, nor in the Zendavesta of the Parsees, had he found indications of
developed colour-perception, any mention of blue colour being entirely absent
from both, though the sky, on the one hand, and light on the other, were specially
considered. Similarly no mention was made of green colour either in the Rigveda
hymns or in the Zendavesta, though both often speak of the earth and its vegeta-
tion. In 1867 Hugo Magnus wrote a work upon this subject, entitled 'Die
Entwickelung des Farbensinnes.' Believing in the same progressive appreciation
of colours as Geiger, he supposed that at first mankind merely perceived white
and black, the presence or absence of light ; that red was the first colour to be
recognised, the power of perceiving the other colours being gradually acquired in

the order of the colours in the solar spectrum, from the red to the violet end.

Magnus believed that it was whilst red and black were alone distinguished that
the hymns of the Vedas were written, that yellow was also recognised in the time
of Homer, and that it was only at a later date that the perception of green
followed, the recognition of blue and violet coming last, that the evolution of
the colour-sense was still incomplete, and that the time would come when the
ultra-violet rays would be appreciated by the human eye.

     The subject of the colour-sense was more thoroughly investigated by Grant

Allen, in a work published in 1879. He pointed out that three periods of geo-
logical vegetation may be supposed to have existed, termed respectively the age of

flowerless, the age of anemophilous, and the age of entomophilous plants. That in
the Carboniferous period there exist traces of insects, which insects must have
jsought their food in the flowerless plants of that age. That plants would thus be
716 REPORT-- 1881.

fertilised by means of insects, the plants most attractive to insects gaining ground

not only from thus having a more sure method of imiDregnation than the wind, but

also because the seedlings due to such cross fertilisation are the most vigorous.

Again, the colour-sense would become more and more perfect in insects, owing to

the advantage which improved colour-sense woidd give them in their search for

food, and these insects would have handed down this power to their insect descend-

ants now living. Similarly Grant-Allen believed colour-perception to have been

first aroused in simple marine animals by the animal organisms around them, and

to have been from them handed down to the fishes and reptiles, and more remotely
to the birds and ' mammals.' Man (the supposed descendant of fruit-eating quad-

rumana, who possessed colour-sense in a high degree) would thus have very perfect

colour-perception. This has been shown to be equally pronounced in all varieties

of the species, not only by the works of travellers and others respecting modern

savages, but by information received from missionaries. Government officials, and

others living among uncivilised races. That the colour-sense existed in am equally

developed condition in ancient times is probable, owing to the character of the

ancient monuments in Egypt, Assyria, and other parts, and to the traces of colour-

perception which exist in the Old Testament. Similarh' there are indications that

perception of colour e.xisted in the Bronze, and even in the Stone Age. Thus while

coloured ornaments and beads have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings, which

are supposed to have belonged to the Bronze Age, stones remarkable for their

colour seem to have been chosen in the Stone age, not only for use but also for

ornament. Again observations made at the request of Holmgren upon various

savage tribes point to similar conclusions, and Hugo Magnus has therefore acknow-

ledged his previous conclusions not to be borne out by actual observation, admitting

that it is not safe to conclude from a deficiency of language that there exists a

corresponding deficiency of perception.

The autlior then considered the value of the arguments brought forward,

showing that the arguments in favour of the gradual development of the colour-

sense in man within historic times were merely philological, and that obser-

vations among the unci^-ilised races now living had shown that the extent of the

colour-perception is not indicated by the variety of terms used to express it. The

fact that the most uncivilised savages had good colom'-perception, and the character

of the monuments in Mycenae, Assyria, and Egypt, which show how developed the

perception of colour was when they were built, pomt to the same conclusion, that

the colour-sense cannot have been gradually developed within the last few thousand

years. The same was shown by the Old Testament scriptures, while coloured

articles belonging to the Bronze or Stone Age indicated the existence of a good

coloiu'-sense in those times. Whatever therefore man had left Ijehind tended to

show that he had always possessed good colour- perception. As to its gradual

development in the animal kingdom, though colour-perception probably did become

more perfect in those insects which li^·ed upon coloured food and in marine animals

on account of the advantage, whether protective, attractive, or other which the

colour-sense would give them, there was no proof that this power was from the

latter ' banded down to the fishes and reptiles, and more remotely to the birds and

--mammals.' The following conclusions were therefore arrived at firstly, that in

man  no  such gradual  de-\'elopment  of the  colour-sense could have taken  place
                                                                                                       ;

secondly, that in animals, though it was not impossible that such might have

occurred, and that colour-perception might have reached its present condition by

the process of evolution, this statement had not been verified by actual observation.

        2. On the Function of the Two Ears in the Perception of Space.
                 By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc.

     The author remarked that the conceptions formed in our minds of the extension

--of space might be resolved into two parts first, the conception of distance

independent of direction ; and, secondly, the conception of direction independent of
distance. These conceptions were based upon the perceptions of three separate
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DBPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 717

--senses muscular, optical, aud auditory. Those of the first two classes were fairly-

 well known, the problems of the optical perception of space having been worked
 out by Wheatstoue, Helmholtz, and others. The perceptions of space dependent
 on the ear had been but imperfectly investigated. Theories had been put forward
 and observations made by Anton, Steinhauser, Graham Bell, E. Mach, Lord
 Rayleigh, Luca, Kupper,"'A. M. Mayer, and by himself. The author reviewed
 various theories and observations which had been made. Steinhauser and Graham
 Bell assumed the perception of direction to depend upon the relative intensity with
 which a sound reached the two ears. Mach and Lord Rayleigh regarded the

 perception as depending rather upon the relative differences of quality in the two
 ears, these differences being due to the partial resolution of compound tones,
 according to Mach, by reason of the ear-cavities acting as resonators, but according
 to Lord Rayleigh by reason of diffi-action of the sound-waves around the head.
 The author, in a paper on ' Binaural Audition,' read to this Section in 1878, had
 shown that differences of phase were also of influence in the acoustic perception
 of direction, The author also referred to a paper read by him before the Associa-
 tion in 1879 on the Pseudophone, an instrument for investigating the laws of
 binaural audition by the illusions it produces in the acoustic perception of space.

 After discussing the merits of the various theories to account for the facts of
 observation upon tones of different degrees of intensity, pitch, phase, and quality,

--the author propounded the following theory : ' Judgments as to the direction of

 sounds are based in general upon the sensations of different intensity in the two
ears, but the perceived difference of intensity upon which a judgment is based is

 not usually the difference in intensity of the lowest or fundamental tone of the

compound sound (or " clang "), but upon the difference in intensity of the individual
tone or tones of the clang for which the intensity-difference has the greatest

effective result on the quality of the sound.' The author concluded with some
remarks and suggestions as to the influence on the perception of sounds of the
form of the convolutions of the pinnae of the ears, and with the suggestion that

now that the physical bases of the problem had been laid down, the problems of

the acoustic perception of space would be greatly elucidated by experiments upon

persons possessed of abnormal hearing, and upon the blind, in whom this perception

is abnormally developed.

A3. Contribution to the Question on the Influence of Bacilli in the Pro-

           duction of Disease. By Professor J. Cossar Ewart, M.D.

    About the end of March a new form of fever made its appearance in Aber-

--deen. The fever began with the usual symptoms there was a well-marked rigor,

then a sensation of coldness for some hours, accompanied with great depression,

the pulse was rapid, and the temperature steadily increased to 103, in some cases

to 105 deg. Fahrenheit. In the worst cases there was delirium. One of the most

characteristic symptoms was an affection of the deep cervical glands and lym-

phatics near the angle of the jaw                                                                                                                                                          the glands enlarged, and  there  was a feeling of
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

fulness about the throat, congestion of the tonsils, and pain along the course of the

lymphatics of the affected side of the neck. In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours

the fever subsided, leaving the patient in a very exhausted state. In most cases

there was a relapse which corresponded exactly with the first attack, with this

difference, that a different set of glands and lymphatics were affected. After this

relapse there was again apparent recovery and then a second relapse. In some cases

there were as many as six relapses, the relapses occun-ing regularly every second

day. In nearly all the cases recovery was slow, and in some abscesses formed near

the angle of the jaw. In three cases the disease proved fatal. When an inquiry was

instituted it was found that over 300 individuals had suffered from this disease, and

Athat all the sufferers had been using milk from the same dairy.                                                                                                                                                            sample of milk

secured for examination, when the epidemic was at its height, was found to contain

--numerous micrococci, fungi spores, and spores wliich resembled those of Bacillus

Anthracis the organism which is associated with splenic fever. When cultivated
--718 REPORT 1881.

the spores germinated into exceedingly delicate bacilli, which on further cultivation
lengthened'lnto spore-bearing filaments. On inoculating rats with the milk con-

tainino- the spores death followed in from eighteen to twenty-four hours. The tissues

of these rats, especially in the region of the neck, were infiltrated with bacilli, which

on cultivation developed into spore-bearing filaments. Inoculation proved both bacilli

and spores to be as virulent as the original spores found in the milk. Confirmatory

evidence of the relation of the bacillus to the disease, and of the disease to the

bacillus was obtained by the examination of pus from an abscess situated near

the angle of the     jaw   of one of   the sufferers. This pus contained spores  and
bacilli similar to          found in,                                            was
                    those              or developed from, the milk. When a rat

inoculated with a minimal quantity of this pus, it suffered and died in the same

way as the rats which were infected with the milk. Further investigations proved
that the organisms had been added to the milk along with water. The water used

at the dairy previous to the epidemic passed through a large concrete cistern (provided

with a rough loose wooden cover) placed in a corner of the byre immediately over
the heads of several cows. The spores reached the byre along with the steamed hay

used as food. Once in the hjre, the spores could have bad little difficulty in enter-
Howino- the water cistern, which was practically a part of the byre.
                                                                      they reached

the tank in which the hay was steamed has not yet been discovered.
     Experiments, after the methods employed by Burdon Sanderson, Pasteur,

--Greenfield and Biichner showed (1) that this bacillus could not be converted
into the hay bacillus {B. suhtilis) ; (2) that the cultivations diminished in virulence
imtil they became quite innocuous; (3) that when the filaments were kept for a

time at a temperature which prevented the appearance of spores, the -^-irulence

became attenuated and ultimately disappeared. Fm'ther experiments may show

that the attenuated forms are capable of aff'ording protection from the active bacilli.

In conclusion it was mentioned that the bacillus could be cultivated on the
fresh-cut surfaces of potatoes and in gelatine--the recent methods described by

Koch.

4 On a little-hnown Cranial Difference between the Catarrhine and Platyr-
                     rhine Monkeys. By W. A. Foebes, B.A.

     Besides the well-known difference in the dentition, and in the form of the
external auditory meatus, in the monkeys of the old and new worlds, there is a
difference in the formation of the bony walls of the temporal fossa which in
nearly every case suffices to distinguish at once the skull of a member of one of

these o-roups from that of one of the other. As independently discovered by the

author ('P.Z.S.' 1880, p. 639), and Dr.Gustav Joseph (' Morphologisches Jahrbuch,'
i. pp. 453-465), in the Platyrrhine monkeys the parietal bone is prolonged
forwards to meet the malar, there being a weU-marked suture usually between the
two the frontal being in consequence altogether excluded, superficially at least,
from articulatino- -with the squamosal and alisphenoid. In the Catarrhine monkeys,
on the other hand, as also in man, the parietal does not reach the malar, there
beino- an isthmus between the two bones formed by the articulation of the frontal

with the alisphenoid.

1. On the Homologij of the Gonario-hypophysial Tract, or of the so-called
     ^Pineal ' and ' Pituitary Glands.' By Professor R. Owen, M.D., C.B.,

      F.B.S.

     The author, referring to the latest contributions to the subjects of bis paper,
remarked that they bore upon the functions of the so-termed glands. Professor
Sapolini, in his work ' L'aire de la Selle Turcique ' (8vo., 1880), concludes that the
'pituitary gland secretes the fluid of the ventricles of the brain;' Professor Ed.

Vom Beneden, in reference to the supposed pituitary gland in Ascidians, regards it

as their renal excretory organ (' Archives de Biologie,' 8vo., 1881).

    In pursuance of his aim, which was homological, Professor Owen traced the
modifications of the pineal and pituitary bodies and connecting parts from man
down to the lowest fishes possessiag a brain ; and noted the progi-essive increased

relative size and retention of tubular structure of the tract including the so-called
' pituitary gland,' ' infundibulum,' ' thii-d ventricle,' and ' pineal gland,' as the series
descended ; and he noted the further extension of the pineal part of the tract, beyond
the brain, to its perforation of the cranium, leaving the so-called ' foramen parietale

or cranial 'navel,' in some existing and in many extinct Reptilia. These phe-
nomena were then tested and compared with concomitant phases in the develop-
ment of the Vertebrate, especially the Mammalian, embiyo. It was shown, as
had been noted by previous embryologists, that, prior to the permanent anterior

outlet of the digestive sac, a production from such sac extended to the large
cerebral vesicle subsequently reduced to a ' third ventricle,' whence the hollow tract
was continued onward to the epithelial covering of the brain, by which it was
closed. The lower, pharyngeal, beginning of this tract also became closed and
modified, as the ' pituitary body' : the upper continuation became modified, and in
higher Vertebrates closed, as the 'pineal body ; but the intermediate portion of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       '

tract retained its primitive hollow condition as the ' third ventricle ' and 'infun-
dibulum.' The ' sella turcica ' in Mammals, like the ' foramen parietale ' in cold-
blooded Vertebrates, were modifications in the skeleton of parts of the primitive
' conario-hypophysial tract.' This tract, under all its modifications, divided, or-
marked vertically, the division between the ' cerebrum ' and the ' optic lobes,' or
divided the ' fore-brain ' from the ' hind-brain.'

     The author next proceeded to point out the homologies of the parts of the
' neural axis ' in Invertebrates with those in Vertebrates.

     The so-called ' supra-cesophageal ganglion or ganglions ' in the former were
homologous with the ' cerebriun or cerebral hemispheres ' in 'the latter. The so-
caUed ' suboesophageal masses ' in Invertebrates answered to the mes- and ep- en-
ceplialic masses in Vertebrates. The neural chords and ganglions continued therefi-om
in Invertebrates answered to or were homologous with the myelon or spinal chord
of Vertebrates, in which the ganglionic structiu'e was more or less concealed, save in
some fishes, by superadded neural substances.

     Now, the ' supra-oesophageal mass,' or ' fore-brain,' in Invertebrates was divided
from the ' sub-oesophageal masses,' or ' hind-brain,' by the production of a tubular

portion of the fore part of the primarily closed alimentary cavity; which, extend-
ing between those parts of the neural axis, opened upon the surface of the head so

attained, and there established the permanent ' mouth ; the tubular extension similarly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         '

retaining its functional or oesophageal relations with the alimentary cavity. The

neural chords connecting the so separated fore-brain from tlie hind-brain, traversed
the sides of this gullet ; as the chords, or crura, proceeding to expand into the fore-
brain of Vertebrates, traverse the sides or walls of that persistent part of the conario-
liypophysial tract, known, in Anthropotomy, as the 'third ventricle.' The large
relative size of the embryonal brain-vesicle, in this relation, is significative of the
homology of the parts extending therefrom.

     Passing, next, to the consideration of the characters which had been held to
determine the ' back ' and ' beUy ' of an animal, the author cited ' coloiu-,' the rela-
720  REPOET 1881.

 tive position of the body of air-breathers to the ground they stood or moved upon,'

 and the criterion which Cuvier adopted to determine these aspects in the notable
 controTersy with Geofiroy St. Hilaire, in 1830. That criterion was the 'cerebrum'

 in Vertebrates, and its homologue, the 'supra-cesophageal ganglion,' in Invertebrates.

 Cuvier exclusively applied the term ' brain ' {ceireaii) to this part of the cerebral
 centres; moreover, he expressly rejects the homology of the spinal chord of Verte-

 brates with the ganglionic chords of the body in Invertebrates.
      In an enlarged copy of the diagram by which Cuvier illustrated his position, the

 author pointed out the grounds on which the great Comparative Anatomist con-
 cluded that, however his opponent might turn about his articulate or molluscous
 subject, the so-called ' brain ' would be on opposite sides of the alimentary canal.

     Now, to reconcile tl is difference it only needs to add to Cuvier's diagram of the
brain of the mammal the conario-hypophysial tract ; and, if the facts and deductions
in the present paper were allowed to be valid, the actual diiference would lie in the
atrophy of the embryonal homologue of the Invertebrate gullet and mouth in the
 Vertebrates, and tlie establishment in them of a new entry to the alimentary cavity.

In the Vertebrate embryo this anterior entry makes its first appearance as a capa-
 cious branchial or water-breathing organ, and traces of this destination are deter-

minable in the higher Vertebrates, in \vhicli the respiratory function is, ultimately,
 otherwise located and is performed in relation to an aerial medium.

      Eetm-ning to the criterions of the dorsal and ventral aspects of the animal body,
the author, with, he believed, all fellow-labourers in Homological Anatomy, main-
tained that the ganglionic body-chord in Invertebrates did answer to the myelon of

 Vertebrates, and that, with the totality of the brain, the so-called 'neural axis'
was determined. So determined, he held that its position was the true criterion of
the dorsal or ' neural aspect ' of the body, whether the animal moved with it next

to or farthest from the ground, or neither the one nor the other, as in the human
pedestrian. The part or aspect of the body opposite the neural one was characterised

by the location of the centre, or chief centres, of the vascular system, and this had
led Professor Owen, at the commencement of his anatomical teaching, to term it

 the ' haemal aspect.'
      Referring, finally, to the diagram of the Invertebrate and Vertebrate animals in

·corresponding positions, agreeably with the above criterion, the author showed that

the so-called 'brain' (Cuvier), or the supra-oesophageal brain-mass, of ('Omparative

Anatomy, was not above, but beneath, the mouth and gullet in Invertebrates, and
that the ' sub-oesophageal mass ' was above the mouth and gullet ; also that the
reverse relative positions were due to the atrophy of the primitive homologues of
such entry in Vertebrates, and the substitution of another opening and conduit to
the stomach ; whereby these anterior openings and conduits are on the lower or
' htemal ' side of the cerebrum in Vertebrates, but on the upper or neural side of the
' cerebrum' or fore-brain in Invertebrates. Hence, the one division may be said to
be ' hsemastomous,' the other division to be ' neurostomous.' But their common
 Ian, or ' unitj' of composition,' was vindicated by the embryonal phenomena.

      The paper was illustrated by drawings of the principal structures described, of
which drawings enlarged diagrams were exhibited to the Section.

2. On the Acetabulum of Animals in which the Ligamentum Teres is de-
                scribed as wanting. By Professor Struthees, M.D.

     In man, the four-cornered bony recess, occupied by fat, in the floor of tlie aceta-
bulum is exactly adapted to receive and cushion the ligamentum teres in the various
movements of the hip-joint. In birds, the equivalent of the recess is a well-defined
thin portion of the membrane which occupies the deficiency in the floor of the bony
acetabulum. The modifications presented by the cotyloid notch, passage, and i-ecess
in mammals possessing the ligament, are, as in man, adaptations to the position,
direction, and size of tlie ligament. In the hippopotamus the bony acetabulum
seems incompatible with the existence of a ligamentum teres.
                                                                      ''

--TBANSACTIONS OF SKCTION D, DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 721

Among the few mammals in wliich tlie ligamentum teres is described as wanting,

the author remarks on the parts in the ornithorhynchiis, sloth, elephant, seal, and
orang. The narrow Y-shaped recess in the ornithorhynchiis suggests a relation to

the triple line of meeting of the three primary bones in development. The condition

in the ox, in which the ligament is present, suggests a similar relation. In the

young human subject the triple line intersects the recess, but the pubes and ilium

each bear only a small part of the recess.

In the three-toed sloth a recess of good length and breadth is seen in the bone.

In the elephant the recess is present, but small in proportion to the size of the

acetabulum. Li the orang a good-sized and deep recess is present, running beyond

the middle of the acetabulum, and as broad as the pubic or ischiatic parts of the

cartilaginous crescent ; the constricted part, leading fi-om the notch, about half as

broad. In the duckbUl, sloth, elephant, and orang there is no mark on the femur

to indicate the insertion of a ligamentum teres.

The author finds the ligamentum teres to be present in the Greenland seal, not
Afree but projecting into the joint from the capsule.
                                                       dissection showing this was

submitted to the Section. The ligament has the usual origin and is inserted into
Aa well-marked notch in the margin of the head of the femur.
                                                              notch, not an

enclosed pit, on the femiir, for the insertion of the ligamentum teres, is seen in various

mammals. In the seal, the acetabular recess is occupied by a fatty and synovial

body, which also projects beyond the recess, and the projecting ligamentum teres

lies against it.

3. On the Correspondence hetween the Articulations of the Metacarpal and
          Metatarsal Bones in Man. By Professor Struthers, M.D.

On comparing the articulations of the bases of the metacarpal bones with those

of the metatarsal bones, it will be foimd that, numerically and homologically, the

correspondence is exact, bone for bone. Besides the great terminal facets for their

carpal and tarsal supporting bases, and the lateral facets on both sides of the thu-d

--and fourth, and on one side of the second and fifth, the second has two corner

facets by which it articulates, in the hand with the trapezium and os magnum,

in the foot with the internal cuneiform and the external cuneiform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;
--fourth has a corner facet by which it articulates, in the hand with the os magnum,

in the foot with the external cuneiform. Thus, including the phalanx, the numbers

of the articulations of the five metacarpal and five metatarsal bones, from within

outwards, are 2, 5, 4, 5, 3. Considering the very different functional adaptation

of these homologous bones, this precise correspondence in their articulations is

remarkable. Although the details of the articulations of each bone are fully given

in the books on anatomy, the above correspondence has been overlooked, an illustra-

tion of how little human anatomy is usually, as yet, taught homologically, although

thereby the study may be made both more interesting and more simple.

It is uncertain whether the variety occasionally seen of an articular facet

between the first and second metatarsal bones is not a residt of civilisation. The

absence of such an articulation in the plantigrade human foot seems explicablejby the

original fi-eedom of the great toe.

       4. On the Pronephros of Teleosteans and Ganoids.
                  By F. M. Balfour, M.A., F.B.8.

The author stated that the enlarged anterior part of the so-called kidnev ot"

Teleosteans and Ganoids, which is usually held to be the persistent pronephros or

head-kidney, was in reality not part of the true kidney, but merely a great mass

of lympliatic tissue. From this it follows that the very remarkable part of the

larval kidney, known as the pronephros, does not persist in Ganoids and Teleosteans

in the adult state ; and since these two groups are the only ones in which this part

of the larval kidney has been supposed to persist in the adult, it must now be held

that there is no group known in which the pronephros lasts beyond larval life.

6. On tlie Causes and Results of assumed Gycloidal Rotation in Arterial

                        Bed Discs. By R. W. Woollcombe.

      The author, having made some experiments with iron discs, given cycloidal
 rotation as projectiles {vide' Vroc. Royal Society,' March, 1862, and 'Journal of
 the Society of Arts,' Oct. 24, 1862, the latter being a paper read by author in

 GSection of the British Association, at Cambridge, in the same .year), in pursuance

 of the subject of rotation in oblate bodies, has been struck by the oblate form of

 the red blood-disc, and advances the view that not only may the peculiar oblate

 form be given it by such rotation, during its development fi'om (as already supposed)
 the amorphous white corpuscular matter, but that the red corpuscle is, until
' checked in the capillaries, impressed also with rotation imparted by two principal

--causes f one, momentary translatory hindrance from the concave side of a curve

  in an artery in passing it such as the aortic, or the angles at the giving off of the
 intercostals ; tlie other also given by the curves in the arteries, necessitating

  a velocity higher towai'ds the distal than the proximal end of the radius of the
 ciu'vature of the artery. These two causes tending to impart rotation to different
 discs in opposite directions, he concei\'es the direction of rotation to be of no

 importance to the disc, so that it does rotate. He relies on tlie natural law

 that ' rotation always tends to settle about the shortest diameter,' for the change
 to such diameter in the disc of any other rotation that might be set up, as, for
 instance, initially about a long diameter, especially in a body so oblate and
 symmetrical as the red disc. This natural law he illustrates by examples of
 every-day experience, as the rolling on their edges of irregidarly- shaped leaves,
  or of scraps of paper on the ground before the wind, or the rolling about its-

 shortest diameter of even an unsymmetrically-shaped stone when impelled or-
 kicked on the ground ; it being on the remarkable facility and permanence of such

 rotation, evidenced as well in the smallest as on the greatest scale in nature, that

  the author relies for the foundation of his hypothesis.

       While the foregoing familiar instances exemplify the first of the two suggested
 ways in which rotation may he imparted, so the other way may be illustrated in
  the well-known experiment of Dr. Plateau with a rotating globule of oil. It
  remains to mention how, in the author's view, the rotation of the discs is left
  vnidisturbed until the capillaries are reached, and, lastly, of what use he assumes

  the alleged rotation to be.

      He assumes that the contents of an artery are permeated by a similar electric

  state, and that from the known mutual repulsion amongst small bodies when in

  a similar electric condition, the corpuscles are tlnis virtually isolated, mechanically,
  from each other, also from the liquor sanguinis, and ordinarilj' (when not at the
  cui-ves overcome by centrifugal force) isolated also from the serous coat of the

  artery ; thus that the discs both translate and rotate presumably 171 vacuo. As to

  the uses of rotation, the author refers to the already recognised augmentation
  of one of the mechanical sources of heat from tlie temporary check to the translative

  movement of the discs in the capillaries, and points out that such heat would be
  supplemented by the necessary total arrest there of rotation in a disc, and that
   it would be but consistent with the recognised economy of forces in nature that
  where such supplementing can be done (as he argues it may be) without additional
   expenditure for either the initial force or for its conservation, and for an end so
  vital as that of heat, it is a iwiori more probable than less so that the movement of
  translation of the red arterial discs would be accompanied by the movement of

   rotation.

       But the author also conceives this supplementing of heat to be not the only
   use of such rotation. The red disc carries the iron, and if there be magnetism in
  the system, as we know there is, then polai-ity in each disc is more conceivable in
   the view of rotation of the disc than of its not rotating.
                                                                                                                                                                              --

     It would be bard to conceive, for instance, of definite magnetic poles in tbe
eartb, were tbat mucb less oblate body tban the disc without rotation. It is true

tbe magnetic poles of tbe earth do not coincide witb tbe axis of rotation ; but it

may be assumed tbat it is by tbe fixing effect of tbe rotation tbat tbe axis of tbe

eartb, omitting tbe nutation, is maintained at its given angle to tbe plane of the

ecliptic, and tbat thus, though tbe magnetic poles are, of course, in oscillation,

yet their direction as regards the fixed stars is a more determinate one tban it

would be if there was translation only of tbe eartb without tbe fixing eflect of

rotation on one axis. Now, the gyroscope demonstrates tbat a plane of rotation

cannot be interfered with without tbe result of determinate precessional movement

movements tbat, if there be rotation, are as likely and as certain to have an object

in the microcosm of animal life as they could have in tbe economy of tbe celestial

bodies, and, it may be added, as they must in any case have when they are but

links in a chain of evolution.

     Tbe author remarks tbat while tbe general course of tbe arteries is direct and

but little curved, the parts where we do find curves are mostly in proximity to
special organs and in localities where it may be assumed tbat that high function

-- --of tbe arterial disc tbe due stimulation of nerve-tissue would be in stronger

request than in parts such as the ordinary muscular tissue, where there was to be

fulfilled a fimction less vital.

This sudden curve or angle of an artery or its spirality would, judging from

what is seen in tbe gyroscope, cause, in the case of tbe simple curve or angle,

a renewed, though  it might be a                           reversed, rotation                                                                    and, in  the  case  of  tbe  spiral
                                                                                                                                              ;

--artery, a precessional movement in the rotating disc, to which, tbe author repeats,

he attaches especial consequence a view tbat is unavoidable to him when be sees

in tbe gyroscope, as one of its phenomena, tbe partial support against gi'avitation

of the rotating disc and enclosing ring.

To sum up the conclusions of tbe author : 1st, rotation imparted by at least

two  diflerent  methods                                    2ndly, rotation  preserved  from hindrance by repulsion due
                                                        ;

to a similar electric condition ; 3rdly, rotation utilised in capillaries by its arrest

there supplementing the heat due to checked translative motion of discs ; 4tbly,

magnetic polarity of iron in discs more defined in direction by plane of rotation

of disc being by the rotation more or less fixed ; 5thly, special organs having

notably curved or belicine arteries, the former adding to the velocity of rotation,

and tbe belicine inducing precessional movement.

 7. Observations on the Incubation of the Indian Python (Python molurus).

                                By W. A. Forbes, B.A.

     Tlie only two previously recorded instances of the incubation of their eggs by
female Pythons in captivity are those recorded by Valenciennes ('Comptes Rendus,'
1841, xiii. pp. 126-133), and Sclater (' P. Z. S.' 1862, pp. 365-368), for P. bidttatus
and P. sehm respectively. During tbe summer of 1881 a female of Python
mulurus, about 12 feet long, which was kept in the same cage in tbe reptile-bouse
in tbe Zoological Society's Gardens as two other Pythons of the opposite sex, one
being of the same species, the other P. bivittaius, laid about fifteen eggs, on which
she sat steadily for about six weeks, in exactly tbe same manner as in tbe two
instances mentioned above. At the termination of that period, as tbe eggs were
decomposing and obviously bad, they Avere removed ; some, at least, were fertilised,
an embryo about llj inches long having been extracted from one.

    With tbe kind aid of Mr. Zambra, of the well-known firm of Negretti &

Zambra, who not only had special thermometers of tbe most approved kind con-

structed for this occasion, but also regularly attended himself to help in the obser-
vations, a series of observations, about two hundred in number, were taken at
regular intervals of 48 or 72 hours, to ascertain the temperature of tbe sitting
female, as compared with tbat of the non-incubating male, kept next door under

nearly identical conditions of temperature and moisture. Tbe result of these shows
tliat, whereas tbe temperature of tbe male, whether taken on the surface or between

the folds of tlie coiled-iip tody, varied very much as the temperature of the air in

the cage, the curves falling or rising with it ; that of the female, taken in the

same way, was much more constant, particularly of the body between the folds.

Not only so, but the average temperature of the female was much higher, the

temperatures for the two sexes being respectively 86-7° F. and 89'76° F. between

the folds, and on the surface 82-6° F. and 84-4° F., giving differences of 305° and 1-9°

in favour of the female. In no case did the temperature of the male, taken be-

tween the folds, exceed  that of the female                                                                                      and  in most cases there was a marked
                                                                                                                              ;

excess in that of the female, the average in one set of observations being as much

as 7'6°. In no case was any such difference as 20'0°, like that recorded by Sclater,

found. The highest temperature observed in the female was 92-8°; the highest

observed hj Valenciennes was 106-7°, or 14'0° higher. The gi-eatest difference be-

tween the surface of the snake and that of the air in the cage observed was 9'6° F.

No such de:;line in temperature from the commencement to the end of incuba-

tion as was observed by Valenciennes could be made out in the present case. The

maxima were attained when the temperature of the surrounding air was also at its

highest, the range of the between-folds temperature being 6° (85'5° to 91'5°).

8. On the Effect of the Voltaic Current on the Elimination of Sugar.

                    By W. H. Stone, M.B., F.B.C.P.

The suggestion of employing electaicity in the form of a constant current in

cases of glycosuria appears to date from the year 1861, on September 2 of which

year M. Mariano Semmola read a paper before the French AcadtSmie des Sciences,

recorded in the ' Comptes Rendus ' of that date. He states his views as to the causa-

tion of the disease at considerable length in twenty-one propositions, referring to a

previous paper brought before the same society six years earlier. Generally he

attributes its occurrence either to exaggerated glycogenic action of the liver, or to

default of respiratory oxidation. The distinction between these two forms, he

thinks, can be made out by the permanence or the transient nature of the phenome-

non and by the large or small quantity of sugar excreted. Where glycosuria accom-

panies disease of the nervous system, the series of symptoms is of a double nature.

The first follows convulsive affections, such as epilepsy and hysteria ; it is usually

of short duration and evanescent ; the second, which accompanies organic cerebral

disease, must be looked on as a glycogenic stimulation of the fourth ventricle, and

persists as long as the brain-disease itself, developing in direct ratio to the proxi-

Amity of the brain-lesion to the roots of the pneumogastric nerve.                                                                    more or less

definite congestion of the floor of the fourth ventricle he considers to be the patho-

logical condition constantly observed in diabetic patients. The action of electricity

seems to point to the disease having begun in an essential neurosis, which would

offer a reasonable chance of cure. This ^iew is strengtliened by the fact that when

diabetic patients are not carried off by tuberculosis, the cause of death is usually

some nervous crisis, such as epilepsy or dyspncea, due to apoplexy of the pons

varolii. In his fifteenth and following propositions M. Semmola states that stimu-

lation of the pneumogastric nerve by a direct current of sufficient force constantly

produces a diminution in the quantity of sugar eliminated, and sometimes in the

bulk of the secretion itself. These effects are passing, and only last from five to

ten hours. Occasionally, however, they are more durable, and may amount to
organic cure. He gives a case of a girl, aged 17, who became diabetic and amau-

rotic at the same time from a fright, and who recovered under galvanism. Elec-

tricity he considers not only a valuable therapeutical agent in such cases, but also

useful in diagnosis, as a means of distinguishing between an idiopathic neurosis and

one symptomatic of cerebral lesion.

The merit of this somewhat forgotten memoir consists not only in the clearness

of the issues it raises, but also in the important distinction between neurotic and

organic glycosuria, which must have struck every independent observer. The clear

estabhshment of such a difference also goes far to explain the very variable results

of treatment in this most intractable disease, and the want of success which has

attended the labours of conscientious observers. It may be worth while to put on
record a case which, although it terminated fatally, presents many points of physio-

logical interest.

A. B. stated that for the last ten or twelve years he had suffered from bron-

chitis in the winter, but had never had hfemoptysis. The present illness, dated
from two years ago, when he noticed frequent micturition, with increased quantity,

and very ravenous appetite. These symptoms were accompanied by much loss of
flesh, thirst, and coldness of the extremities. He stated that the urinary secretion

averaged five or si.i pints daily, but had risen to nine pints. It tasted sweet at

Hetimes, and at others bitter ; in the latter case being very dark in colour.

knew of no cause for the illness, and entirely denied any fright, mental shock, or

anxiety.

    He was an intelhgent man, by trade a surgical instrument maker, a fact which

was of service in the use of galvanism. The skin was dry and rough ; the eye-
sight dim, with occasional double vision. The pulse 68, rather weak. The
heart-soimds were normal. The chest showed the usual signs of emphysema, with

effacement of the cardiac dulness. The liver was, for the same reason, somewhat

pushed downwards, but not enlarged, tender, or altered in resistance. The tongue
was clean. The urine amounted to 73 oz., with a sp. gr. of 1-040. The tempera-
ture was throughout slightly subnormal, 97°-98°.

    He was in the habit of taking crude opium in 2-gr. doses, twice or thrice

daily, and at first expressed a strong cra\Tng for the drug. He was ordered codeia

gr. ij, ter die, which gave him considerable relief and enabled him, of his own

accord, to discontinue the opium. His chief complaint at this time was of failing

eyesight.

     The ophthalmoscope gave negative results, and there was no sign of cataract.
There was well-marked central scotoma to colours, and the case resembled tobacco

amblyopia, possibly accelerated by ill-health. During the first week the urine

averaged 84 oz. daily, and contained, on quantitative examination, about 5 oz. of
sugar. The treatment consisted solely of the codeia named above, which was

afterwards replaced by a lemonade made with acid phosph. dil. sweetened with
glycerine, and flavoured with lemons.

The improvement noted at flrst was not maintamed, and the codeia was

resumed, but the quantity of urine rose to 102 oz., to 139 oz., and ultimately to

150 oz. vnth a specific gravity of 1-040. The falling off in condition was so ob-

vious that the lungs were again carefully examined, with a view to detect signs of
latent phthisis, which were not, however, found.

    He remained very ill during the month, and his weight sank to 8 st. 2^ lb.

The urine was 160 oz., and shortly after it rose to the highest quantity recorded,

viz. 170 oz., with an occasional sp. gr. of 1-045.

Seeing the threatening nature of the symptoms and the total ineffectuality of

treatment, the use of the continued current to the head was suggested. It was

decided  to  employ  an  ascending  current  from  the  nape  of  the  neck  to  the  forehead
                                                                                                                                ;

the negative pole being placed in the former region, the positive in the latter.

The current was of 1,500 micro-vebers in strength, and was at first continued for

seven minutes. It gave him no imeasiness, and he thought himself temporarily

better after it. It was from the first obvious that the action of electricity in a

case of depraved nutrition, probably due to disorder of the organic nervous centre,
should not be merely stimulant and occasional, but catalytic and constant. The
patient himself was therefore entrusted with a powerful bichromate battery of thirty
cells, and directed to use the strongest current he could bear with comfort, as
above described, twice or thrice a day. All kinds of mechanical contact-makers
and commutators were discarded, and the battery, instead of being screwed up in
a French-polished box, was ranged in three sets of ten cells on the ward table.

A simple binding-screw was attached to the required cell. It was thus easy to

see what was being done, and impossible to err as to the real direction of the
current. On electrical measurement, the strongest current lie could bear, from
nape to forehead, was found to be one of 10,000 micro-vebers. But a more
moderate current of 1,800 micro-vebers was begun with and increased to 2,000
 726 KEPOBT-- 1881.

 micro-veters ; it seemed to answer all purposes. The patient himself entered
 heartily into the treatment, and from the first declared himself better. The
 earliest symptom to amend was the eyesight, and the pinched expression of the
 face, which soon disappeared, with rapid recovery of flesh, amounting to 4 Ihs.
 within a few weeks.

     On December 6 the urine measured 80 oz., of sp. gr. 1-040. The thirst was less.
He did not require opium, though he still took the codeia thrice daily in 2-gr.
doses. The note taken on that day says : ' Patient uses 14 cells of the bichromate
battery ; is very much better.' The improvement was maintained imtil December
23, when some digestive disturbance occurred. On that day the quantity of water

·was 74 oz.

     On the 27th the sp. gr. was found to be. 1-0.38, the quantity 68 oz. On fermen-

tation the sp. gr. only sank to 1*026, indicating a reduction of sugar excreted from

5 to about 2 oz. daily.

     On January 7 the urine was quantitatively tested, in consequence of a severe

relapse accompanied by febrile symptoms, which had necessitated the omission of
the electricity. It was of sp. gr. 1-042, containuig sugar 8-00 and urea 0-97 per
cent., with a trace of albumen. It had simk in quantity to under 60 oz. daily.
The febrile access proved to be due to abscess.

     On the 1.3th the quantity of urine rose again to 100 oz. Directly he could

leave his bed he recommenced the use of the battery with the greatest ardour,

from a conviction that it was of ser^ace to him. He was now able to bear a

current of 10,000 micro-vebers from thirty-two of the bichromate cells above-

mentioned.

     On the 22nd the quantity of urine M-as 68 oz. It continued at a comparatively

reduced standard until February 9, ou which day a large carbuncular boil began
to form at the back of the neck, where the negative pole of the battery had been
applied. The use of galvanism was then finally discontinued. The patient

became much worse, restless, semi-comatose, with raw excoriated tongue, unable
to take food or stimulants. The quantity of urine rose to 110 and 120 oz. The

temperature remained at 98-6° Fahr. In this condition he remained until February

21, when it sank to 962°. On the follo-\^-ing day he died. The pons varohi and
medulla oblono-ata, on examination by Dr. Dickinson, showed enlargement, by

erosion, of the peri-vascular canals in the lower part of the medulla near its
centre, in the olivary bodj^, in the upper part of the medulla, close to the floor of
the fourth ventricle, and in the anterior part of the pons between the roots of the
crura cerebri. In the two latter positions, both of which were in or close to the
median plane, minute collections of brown matter were to be seen, external to the
vessels, which consisted of blood-corpuscles apparently extruded during life.

     The above brief notes are not intended to represent the whole bearings of a subject

which cannot but be considered of importance. AU details of a medical character

have been excluded but it has occurred to the author that sufiicient facts of a
                                                                                                                 ;

purely physiological bearing remain, which may deserve the attention of the

Section.

     After the recent valuable researches of Mr. Gore in electiical osmose and
dift'usion. the statement of M. Semmola made twenty years ago, confirmed as it is
by the above case, deserves careful reconsideration. The chemical efliects of the
galvanic current employed in its continuous form, undoubtedly require develop-
ment, in opposition to the purely stimulant action on nerve and muscle of the
induced current. The fact of a definite polarisation of the tissues included in a
galvanic circuit, leading to a reverse current of a secondary character, has been
sho-\vn both by Oyon of St. Petersburg, and by Onimus of Paris. It would
almost seem, in this instance, as if an inhibitory alteration of osmose could be
transmitted downwards fi-om the governing centre, under the catalytic influence of
the voltaic current, to the secreting organ at its peripheral extremity.

--President of the Section Sir J. D. Hooker, K.C.S.L, C.B., M.D., D.C.L.,

                                      LL.D., P.K.S., V.P.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.G.S.

                             THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.

      The President delivered the following Address :

                              On Geograjjhical Distribution.

It has been suggested that a leading feature of the sectional addresses to be
delivered on the occasion of this, the fiftieth anniversary of the meetings of the

British Association, should be a review of the progress made during the last half-
century in the branches of knowledge which the Sections respectively represent.

      It has further been arranged that, at so auspicious an epoch, the Sections should,

when possible, be presided over by past Presidents of the Association. This has
resulted in almost every sectional chair being occupied by a President eminent as a
cultivator of the science with which his Section will be engaged, though not the

one I have the honour of filling, which, from the fact of there being no professed
geographer amongst the surviving past Presidents, has been confided to an amateur.

     Under these circumstances I should be untrue to myself and to you, if I pre-
sumed to address you as one conversant with geography in any extended significa-
tion of the word, or if I attempted to deal with that important and attractive
branch of it, topographical discovery, which claims more or less exclusively the
time and attention of the geographers of this country. It is more fitting for me,
and more in keeping with the objects of this Association, that I be allowed to
discourse before you on one of the many branches of science the pursuit of which
is involved in the higher aims of geographers, and which, as we are informed by
an accomplished cultivator of the science, are integral portions of scientific geo-
gi-aphy.' Of these none is more important than that of the distribution of animals
and plants, which further recommends itself to you on this occasion from being a
subject that owes its great progress during the last half-century as much to the
theories advanced by celebrated voyagers and travellers as to their observations
and collections.

     Before, however, I proceed to off'er you a sketch of the progress made during
the lifetime of the Association in this one branch, I must digress to remind you,
however briefly, of the even greater advances made in others, in many cases

through the direct or indirect instrumentality of the Association itself, acting in
concert with the Royal and with the Royal Geographical Societies.

      In topography the knowledge obtained during this half-century has been impre-
cedentedly great. The veil has been withdrawn from the sources of the Nile, and the
lake systems of Central Africa have been approximately localised and outlined. Aus-
tralia, never previously traversed, has been crossed and recrossed in various direc-

tions. New Guinea has had its coasts surveyed, and its previously utterly unknown

interior has been here and there visited. The topography of Western China and

      ' Major-General Strachey, in a lecture delivered before the Royal Geographical
Society {Procecdiiif/s, vol. xxxi. p. 179, 1877) discusses with just appreciation and
admirable cleai'ness, the interdependence of the sciences which enter into the study
and aims of scientific geogi'aphy, and wliich he enumerates under fourteen heads.

This lecture contains the ablest review of the subject known to me. It might very
well be entitled ' The whole duty of the Geographer.' Every traveller's outfit should
inchide a copy of it, and one should accompany every prize given by the Geogra-

phical Society to students for proficiency in geographical knowledge.
728 REPORT-- 1881,

Central Asia, which had been sealed books since the days of Marco Polo, has been
explored in many quarters. The elevations of the highest mountains of both hemi-
spheres have been accurately determined, and themselves ascended to heights never
before attained; and the upper regions of the air have been ballooned to the extreme
limit beyond which the life-sustaining organs of the human frame can no longer
perform their functions. In hydrography the depths of the great oceans have
been sounded, their shores mapped, and their physical and natural history explored
from the Equator to beyond both polar circles. In the Arctic regions the highest
hitherto attained latitudes have been reached ; Greenland has been proved to be an
island ; and an archipelngo has been discovered nearer to the Pole than any other
land. In the Antarctic regions a new continent has been added to our maps, crowned
with one of the loftiest known active volcanoes, and the Antarctic ocean has been
twice traversed to the 79th parallel. Nor have some of the negative results of
modern exploration been less important, for the Mountains of the Moon and many
lesser chains have been expunged from our maps, and there are no longer believers
in the inland sea of Australia or in the open ocean of the Arctic pole. Of these and

many others of the geographical discoveries of the last half-century full accounts
will be laid before you, prepared for this Section by able geographers; of whom Mr.
Markham will contribute Arctic discovery; Sir Richard Temple, Asiatic; Lieut.-Col.

Sir James Grant and Mr. H. Waller, African ; Mr. Moseley, Australian ; Mr.
Trelawny Saunders, Syrian (including the Holy Land) ; the Ilydrographer of
the Admiralty will undertake the great oceans, and Mr. F. Galton will discuss the
improvements effectt'd in the instruments, appliances, and methods of investigation
employed in geographical researches.

     Of other branches of science which are auxiliary to scientific geography, the
majority will be treated of in the Sections of the Association to which they
belong; but there are a few which I must not, in justice to the geographers who
have so largely contributed to their advance, leave unnoticed.

     Such is terrestrial magnetism ' which had as its first investigators two of our

earliest voj-^agers, the ill-fated Hudson and Halley, who determined the magnetic

dip in the North polar and tropical regions respectively. Theirs were the precur-
sors of a long series of scientific expeditions, duriuff which the dipping needle was
carried almost from Pole to Pole, and which culminated in the establishment,
mainly under the auspices of this Association, of the magnetic survey of Great
Britain, of fixed magnetic observatories in all quarters of the globe, and of the An-
tarctic expedition of Sir James Eoss, who, since the foundation of the Association,
planted the dipping needle over the northern Magnetic Pole, and carried it within
200 miles of the southern one.

     Nor is the geography of this half-century less indebted to physicists, geolo-
gists, and naturalists. It is to a most learned traveller and naturalist, Von Baer,
that the conception is due that the westward deflection of all the South Russian
rivers is caused by the revolution of the globe on its axis." It was a geologist,
Ramsay, who explained the formation of so many lake-beds in mountain regions-
by the gouging action of glaciers. It was a physicist and mountaineer, Tyndall,
who discovered those properties of ice upon which the formation and movement of
glaciers depend. The greatest of naturalist-voyagers, Darwin, within the same
half-century has produced the true theory of coral reefs and atolls, showed the
relations between volcanic islands and the rising and sinking of the bottom of the
ocean, and proved that along a coast-line of 2,480 miles the southern part of the
continent of South America has been gradually elevated from the sea-level to 600
feet above it. Within almost the same period Poulett Scrope and Lyell have
revolutionised the theory of the formation of volcanic mountains, showing that these
are not the long-taught upheavals of tlie crust of the earth, but are heaped up
deposits from volcacic vents, and they have largely contributed to the abandon-

 ment of the venerable theory that mountain chains are sudden up-thrusts. With-
 in the same period, the theory of the great oceans having occupied their present
 positions on the globe from very early geological times was first propounded by
 Dana,^ the companion of Wilkes in his expedition round the world, and is supported
 by Darwin and by Wallace.

      In Meteorology the advance is no less attributable to the labours of voyagers
 and travellers. The establishment of the Meteorological office is due to the
 energy and perseverance of a great navigator, the late Admiral Fitzroy.

      Another domain of knowledge that claims the strongest sympathies of the
 geographer is Anthropology. It is only within the last quarter of a century that

the study of man imder his physical aspect has been recognised as a distinct branch

 of science, and represented by a flourishing society, and by annual international

 congresses.

      I must not conclude this notice without a passing tribute to a department of
 Geography that has occupied the attention of too few of its cultivators. I mean

 that of literary research. Nevertheless, in this too the progress has been great
and I need only mention the publications of the Hakluyt Society, and two works

of prodigious learning and the greatest value, 'The Book of Marco Polo, the
Venetian,'^ and 'A History' of Ancient Geography,' ^ to prove to you that one
need not to travel to new lands to be a profound and sagacious geographer.

     I have asked you to accept the geographical distribution of organic beings as
the subject which I have chosen for this address. It is the branch with which

I am most familiar ; it illustrates extremely well the interdependence of those

sciences which the geographer should study, and as I have before observed, its-
progress has been in the main due to the labours of voyagers and travellers.

      In the science of distribution, Botany took the lead. Humboldt, in one of his
essays,* says that the germ of it is to be found in an idea of Tournefort, developed
by Linnaeus. Tournefort was a Frenchman of great learning, and, moreover, a

great traveller. He was sent by the King of France in 1700 to explore the islands

of Greece and mountains of Armenia, in the interests of the Jardin des Plantes,
and his published narrative is full of valuable matter on the people, antiquities,
and natural productions of the countries he visited. The idea attributed to him

by Humboldt ^ is, that in ascending mountains we meet successively with vegeta-
tions that represent those of successively higher latitudes ; upon which Humboldt

observes : ' II ne fallut pas une grande sagacite pour observer que sur les peutes des
hautes montagnes de I'Armenie, des vegetaux des differentes latitudes se auivent

comme lea climats supei-poses I'un sur les autres;' but he goes on to remark,

* cette idee de Tournefort developpee par Linne dans deux dissertations int^ressantes

(Stationes et Colonife Plantarum), renferment cependant le germe de la Geographie
Botanique.' Tournefort's idea was, however, an advanced one for the age he
lived in, and should not be judged by the light of the knowledge of a succeeding

century. He had no experience of other latitudes than the few intervening
between Paris and the Levant. Humboldt himself did not suspect the whole

bearing of the idea on the principles of geographical distribution, and that the
parallelism between the floras of mountains and of latitudes was the result of
community of descent of the plants composing the floras, nor that it was brought
about by physical causes. The idea of the early part of the eighteenth century is,

when rightly understood, found to be the forerunner of the matured knowledge of

the middle of the nineteenth.

high rank as such, paved the way to a con-ect study of botanical geography.

Before his time little or no attention was paid to the topography of plants, and he

was the first to distinguish, to lay down rules, and to supply models for these two

--important elements in their life-history namely, their habitats or topographical

localisation, and their stations, or the physical nature of their habitats. In his

* Stationes Plantarum,' ' Linnaeus defines with precision twenty-four stations

characterised by soil, moisture, exposure, climate, &c., which, with comparatively

slight modifications and improvements, have been adopted by all subsequent

authorities. Nor, indeed, was any marked advance in this subject made, till

geological observation and chemical analysis supplemented its shortcomings. In

his essay ' De coloniis plantarum,' published fourteen years after the ' Stationes,' *

he says, ' Qui veram cunque et solidam plantarum scientiam aucupatur, patriam

ipsarum ac sedem cuj usque propriam baud sane ignorabit,' and he proceeds to

give an outline of the distribution of certain plants on the globe, according to

climate, latitude, &c., and to indicate their means of transport by winds, birds,

and other agencies. India (meaning the tropics of both worlds) he charac-

terises as the region of  palms ;  the temperate latitudes, of  herbaceous plants                                                                                    the

--northern, of mosses, algee, and coniferae ; and America, of ferns ; thus preparing

the way for the next great generaliser in the field.'

     This was the most accomplished and prolific of modern travellers, Humboldt,

who made Botany a chief pursuit during all his journeys, and who seems, indeed,

to have been devoted to it from a very early age. His first work was a botanical

one, the ' Flora Friburgensis,' and we have it on his own authority that three

years before its publication, when he was only just of age (in 1790) he commimi-

cated to his friend, G. Forster, the companion of Cook in his second voyage, a

sketch of a geography of plants. It was not, however, till his return from America

that his first essay on Botanical Geography * appeared, which at once gave him

Upa very high position as a philosophical naturalist.  to the period of its appear-

ance there had been nothing of the kind to compare with it for the wealth of

facts, botanical, meteorological, and hypsometrical, derived from his own observa-

tions, from the works of travellers and naturalists, and from personal communica-

tion with his contemporaries, all correlated with consummate skill and discussed

with that lucidity of exposition of which he was a master. The great feature of

this essay is the exactness of the methods employed for estimating the conditions

under which species, genera, and families are grouped geographicallj', and the pre-

cision with which they are expressed.

This was succeeded in 1815, and subsequently, by four other essays on the

same subject. Of these the most valuable is the ' Prolegomena,' ^ in which he

botanices ' which consists in determining the proportion which the species of certain

large families or groups of families bear to the whole number of species composing the

floras in advancing from the Equator to the Poles, and in ascending mountains. Some

Cruciferse, &c., find their maximum in temperate regions, and decrease in both
directions. He adds that it is only by accurately measuring this decrease or

increase that laws can be established, when it is found that these present constant
relations to parallels of temperature.' Furthermore, he says that in many cases
the whole number of plants contained in any given region of the globe may be

approximately determined by ascertaining the number of species of such families.

researches in geographical botany is obvious, for it affords the most instructive

method of setting forth the relations that exist between a flora and its geographical

position and climatai conditions.

Humboldt's labours on the laws of distribution were not limited to floras, they

included man and the lower animals, cultivated and domesticated, as well as
native ; they may not be works of the greatest originality, but they show remark-

able powers of observation and reflection, astonishing industry, conscientious

·exactitude in the collection of data, and sagacity in the use of them: he is indis-

putably the founder of this department of geographical science.

    No material advance was made towards improving the laws of geographical

distribution - so long as it was believed that the continents and oceans had ex-

perienced no great changes of surface or of climate since the introduction of the

existing assemblages of animals and plants. This belief in the comparative sta-

bility of the surface was first dispersed by Lyell, who showed that a fauna may be
older than the land it inhabits. To this conclusion he was led by the study of

the recent and later tertiary molluscs of Sicily, which he found had migi-ated into
that land before its separation from the continent of Italy just, he adds, as the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

plants and animals of the Phlegraean fields had colonised Monte Nuovo since that
mountain was thrown up in the sixteenth century ; whence, he goes on to say, we
are brought to admit the curious result, that the fauna and flora of Val de Noto,
and of some other mountain regions of Italy, are of higher antiquity than the
country itself, having not only flourished before the lands were raised from the
deep, but even before they were deposited beneath the waters.^ The same idea

occurred to Darwin who, alluding to the very few species of living quadrupeds
·which are altogether terrestrial in habit, that are common to Asia and America,

and to these few being confined to the extreme frozen regions of the North, adds,

We' may safely look at this quarter (Behring's Straits), as the line of communica-

tion (now interrupted by the steady progress of geological change), by which the
elephant, the ox, and the horse entered America, and peopled its wide extent.' *

     The belief in the stability of climatai conditions during the lifetime of the
existing assemblages of animals and plants was also dispelled by the discovery,
throughout the northern temperate regions of the old and new worlds, of Arctic

and boreal plants on all their mountains, and of these fossilised on their low lands ;.

discoveries which led to the recognition of the glacial period and glacial ocean.

The first and boldest attempt to press the results of geological and climatal

changes into the service of botanical and zoological geography, was that of the

late Edward Forbes, a naturalist of genius, who, like Tournefort, chose the Levant

as the field for his early labours. In the year 1845, Forbes communicated a paper

to the Natural History section of this Association, on the distribution of endemic

plants, especially those of the British Islands, considered with regard to geological

changes.^ In this paper the British flora is considered to consist of assemblages

of plants from five distinct sources, which, with the exception of one, immigrated

during periods when the British Isles were united to the continent of Europe,

and have remained more or less localised in England, in Scotland, or in

Ireland. Of these he considered the Pyrenean assemblage, which is confined to

the west of Ireland, to be the oldest, and to have immigrated after the eocene

period, along a chain of now submerged mountains, that extended across the

Atlantic from Spain to Ireland, and indeed formed the eastern boundary of an

imaginary continent of pliocene age, which extended to the Azores Islands, and

beyond them. This, the ' Atlantis ' of speculative geologists, has long since been

abandoned. The second assemblage is of plants characteristic of the South-West

of France, which now prevail in Devon, Cornwall, and the Channel Islands

their immigration he assigns to a pliocene date, probably corresponding to the

red crag. The third assemblage is of plants of the North-East ot France, which

abound in the chalk districts of the South-Eastern counties of England ; their

immigration is referred to the era of the mammaliferous crag. The fourth is of

Alpine plants now found on the mountains of Scotland, Wales, and England

these were introduced mainly by floating ice from Scandinavia during the glacial

period, when the greater part of the British Isles were submerged, its mountain

tops forming part of a chain of islands in the glacial sea that extended to the coast

of Norway                                                      this was during the newer pliocene period.  Lastly, the Germanic plants

were introduced during the upheaval of the British Islands from the glacial ocean,

and as the temperature was gradually increasing ; these are spread over the whole
islands, though more abundant on the eastern side. At the commencement of this

immigration England was supposed to be continuous with the Germanic plains, from

which it was subsequently severed by the formation of the English Channel. Also,.

at the commencement of this immigration Ireland was assumed to be con-

tinuous with England, to be early severed by the formation of the Irish Sea ;.

which severance, by interrupting the migration of Germanic types, accounts for the

absence of so many British animals in the sister island.

I have thus briefly related Forbes' views, to show how profoundly he was im-

pressed with the belief that geographical and climatal conditions were the all-

powerful controllers of the migrations of animals and plants. Forbes was the re-

former of the science of geographical distribution.^

a rigidly statistical metliod, traced their distribution in every county, and grouped
them according to their continental aflinities, as well as by the physical conditions.

of their habitats.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  733

      Before the publication of the doctrine of the origin of species by variation

find natural selection, all reasoning on their distribution was in subordination to

the idea that these were permanent and special creations; just as, before it was
shown that species were often older than the islands and mountains they inhabited,
 naturalists had to make their theories accord with the idea that all migration took

 place under existing conditions of land and sea. Hitherto the modes of dispersion

 of species, genera, and families, had been traced; but the origin of representative

 species, genera, and families, remained an enigma ; ' these could be explained only

 by the supposition that the localities where they occurred presented conditions so

similar that they favoured the creation of similar organisms, which failed to ac-

 count for representation occurring in the far more numerous cases where there is

 no discoverable similarity of physical conditions, and of their not occurring in places

where the conditions are similar. Now under the theory of modification of species

after migration and isolation, their representation in distant localities is only a ques-
 tion of time and changed physical conditions. In fact, as Darwin well sums up,
 alP the leading facts of distribution are clearly explicable under this theory; such

as the multiplication of new forms ; the importance of barriers in forming and

 separating zoological and botanical provinces; the concentration of related species
in the same area ; the linking together under different latitudes of the inhabi-
tants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, and the
linking of these with the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same areas

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and the fact of different forms of life occurring in areas having nearly the same

physical conditions.

     With the establishment of the doctrine of the orderly evolution of species
under known laws, I close this list of those recognised principles of the science of
geographical distribution, which must guide aU who enter upon its pursuit. As
Humboldt was its founder, and Forbes its reformer, so we must regard Darwin as
its latest and greatest lawgiver. With their example, and their conclusions to
guide, advance becomes possible whenever discovery opens new paths, or study

and reflection retraverse the old ones.

     And it was not long before palaeontology brought to the surface new data for

the study of the present and past physical geography of the globe.
     This was the discovery in Arctic latitudes of fossil plants whose existing

representatives are to be found only in warm temperate ones. To Arctic travel-
lers and voyagers this discovery is wholly due. Of these, I believe I am cor-
rect in saying that Sir John Eichardson was the earliest, for he, in the year
1848, when descending the McKenzie river to the Polar Sea in search of the

Franklin Expedition, found in lat. 65° N. beds of coal, besides shales, full of leaves
of forest-trees belonging to such genera as the maple, poplar, taxodium, oak, &c.
In the narrative of his journey,^ Richardson mentions these fossils and figures some
of them ; and in a subsequent work * he speaks of them as ' leaves of deciduous trees
belonging to genera which do not in the present day come so far north on the
American continent by ten or twelve degrees of latitude.' This discovery was
followed, in 1853, by the still more remarkable one, by Captain M'Clure and
Sir Alexander Armstrong (during another search for Sir John Franldin), of pine-
cones and acorns imbedded in the soil of Banksland, in lat. 75° N., at an elevation

     "^ Of the many pre-Darwinian writers on distribution who advocated the Lamar-
kian doctrine of evolution, I am not aware of any who suggested that it would

 explain the existence of representative species, or indeed any other of the pheno-
mena of distribution. Von Baer, however, in the very year of the publication

of the first edition of the Oriffin of Specien, expressed his conviction, chiefly grounded

on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now specifically distinct have

descended from a single parent form. See Orirjiii of Species, e"d. 5. Historical

of 300 feet above the sea-level. And again in 1854, Dr. Lyall found exten-

sive accumulations of similar fossils near Discoe in Greenland (lat. 70° N.), during

the return of Sir Edv^ard Belcher's searching expedition. Nor are these fossils
confined to America : they have been found in Spitzbergen, in Siberia, and in many-

other localities within the Polar area as well as south of it, proving that forests of

deciduous trees, in all respects like those of the existing forests of the warm

temperate regions, approached to within ten degrees of the Pole. The first of these
collections critically examined was Dr. Lyall's ; it was communicated to Professor
Heer of Zurich, the highest authority on the flora of the tertiary period, and described

by him,' as were also subsequently all the other collections brought from the Arctic

regions.^

The examination of these fossil leaves revealed the wonderful fact that, not

only did they belong to genera of trees common to the forests of all the three

northern continents, such as planes, beeches, ashes, maples, &c., but that they also

included what are now extremely rare and even local genera, as sequoia, liqiii-

damber, magnolia, tulip-trees, gingkos, &c., proving that the forests were of a

more mixed character than any now existing. These results opened up a new

channel for investigating the problem of distribution, and the first naturalist to

enter it was a botanist. Dr. Asa Gray, who pursued it with brilliant results, em-

bodied in a series of memoirs on the vegetation of the United States of America,

of which my notice must be most brief.

When studying the collections of Japanese plants brought by the officers of

Wilkes' expedition, Dr. Gray found cumulative evidence of the strong affinity

between the flora of Eastern Asia and Eastern North America, to the exclusion of

the western half of that continent; and also that Europe and Western Asia did not

share in this affinity. But what especially attracted his attention was, that

this affinity did not depend only on a few identical or representative genera but

upon many endemic genera of exceptional character, and often consisting of only

two almost identical species. This led to a rigorous comparison of those plants

with the fossils from the Arctic regions whose affinities had been determined by

Heer and with others which had been meanwhile accumulating in the United
State's, and had been described by Lesquereux ; and the result was what I may call

an abr'ido-ed outline history of the flora of North America in its relations to the

physical 'geography of that country, from the cretaceous to the present time.

The latest researches which have materially advanced our knowledge of the

laws of distribution are those of Prof. Blytt, of Christiania. His essay on ' the

immigration of the Norwegian flora during alternately rainy and dry periods, has

for its' object to define and localise the various assemblages of plants of which that

flora is composed, and to ascertain their mother-country and the sequence of their in-

troduction. The problem is that of Prof. Forbes, which I have already described

to vou only substituting Norway for the British Isles. Both these authors invoke

the" o-lacial period to account for the dispersion of Arctic plants, both deal with a

rising  land, both assume that  immigration took  place over  land                         but  Prof. Blytt

flnds another and most powerful controlling agent, in alternating periods of greater
moisture and comparative drought, of which the Norwegian peat-bogs afford ample

proof. These boo-s were formed during the rise of the land, as the cold of the

glacial period declined. They are found at various heights above the sea in Nor-

way · the most elevated of them are of course the oldest, and contain remains of
the' earliest immigrants. The lowest are the newest and contain remains of the
latest introduced plants only. The proofs of the alternating wet and dry seasons

rest on the fact, that the diiferent layers of peat in each bog present widely different
characters, contain the remains of different assemblages of plants, and these

characters' recur in the same order in all the bogs. First there is a layer of

wet spongy peat, with the remains of bog-mosses and aquatic plants ; this gradually
passes upwards into a layer of dry soil containing the remains of many land plants,

succeeds wet spongy peat as before, to be again covered with dry peaty soil and

tree trunks, &c., and so on. From an examination of the plant-remains in these

--formations, Prof. Blytt draws the following conclusions:

The Norwegian flora began with an immigration of Arctic plants during a dry

period, evidence of which he finds in the presence of the remains of these beneath
the lowest layer of peat. As the climate became warmer and the land rose, a

rainy period set in, accompanied by an immigration of sub-arctic plants (juniper,

mountain ash, aconites, Sec), which to a great extent replaced the Arctic

flora, which is impatient of great wet. This was the period of the flrst peat-bog
formation. It was followed by a dry period, during which the bogs gradually dried

up ; while, with the increasing warmth, deciduous trees and their accompanying

herbaceous vegetation were introduced. The succeeding rainy season produced

a second peat-formation, killing and burning the deciduous trees, the increasing
warmth at the same time bringing in the Atlantic flora, characterised by the holly,

foxglove, and other plants ilow confined in Norway to the rainy Atlantic coast.
To this succeeded a third period of drought, when the bogs dried up and pine
forests with their accompanying plants immigrated into Norway, to be in like
manner destroyed and buried by bog earth during the next following rainy period

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and it was during these last alternations that the subboreal plants now affecting
the lowest south-eastern districts of Norway were introduced ; and the sub-atlantic

plants, the most southern of all the types, which are confined to the extreme south

of the country.

It would be premature to regard all Prof. Blytt's recurrent periods as irrefrag-

ably established, or his correlations of these with the several floras as fully proved
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but there is no doubt, I think, that he has brought forward a vera cmma to account

for the alternation of dry country with wet country plants in Norway, and one that

must have both actively promoted the first introduction of these into that country

and also influenced their subsequent localisation. It would strengthen Prof. Blytt's-

conclusions very much, if his alternating periods of rain and drought should be found

to harmonise with Mr. CroU's recurrent astronomical periods, and with Mr. Geikie's

fluctuations of temperature during the decline of the glacial epoch : so would also

geography and vegetation of these two countries, that I do not doubt a comparison

of their peat-formations would yield most instructive results.

    Thus far all the knowledge we have obtained of the agents controlling geo-

graphical distribution have been derived from observations and researches on

northern animals and plants, recent and tertiary. Turning now to the southern
hemisphere, the phenomena of distribution are much more difficult of explanation.

Geographically speaking there is no Antarctic flora except a few lichens and sea-

weeds. The plants called Antarctic,' from their analogy with the Arctic, are very

few in number.and nowhere cross 62° of south latitude. They are, in so far a"s

few non-endemic are species of the nearest continents, or are identical with tempe-

rate northern or with sub-arctic or even Arctic species. Like the Arctic flora, the

Antarctic is a very uniform one round the globe, the same species, in many cases,

especially the non-endemic, occurring on every island, though there are sometimes

thousands of miles of ocean between the nearest of these. And, as many of tlie

island plants reappear on the mountains above mentioned, far to the north'of their
island homes, it is inferred on these grounds, as well as on astronomical and geo-
logical, that there was a glacial period in the southern temperate zone as we'll as
in the northern.

The south temperate flora is a fourfold one. South America, South Africa,

                  REPORT 1881.

Australia, and New Zealand contain each an assemblage of plants difFerinof more

by far amongst themselves than do the floras of Europe, North Asia, and North

America ; thej- contain, in fact, few species in common, except the Antarctic ones

that inhabit their mountains. These south temperate plants have their represen-

tative species and genera on the mountains of the tropics, ench in their own

meridian only, and there they meet immigrants from all latitudes of the northern

hemisphere. Thus the plants of Fuegia extend northward along the Andes,

ascending as they advance. Australian genera reappear on the lofty mountain of

Kini-balu in Borneo ; New Zealand ones on the mountains of New Caledonia ; and

the most interesting herbarium ever brought from Central Africa, that of Mr. .Joseph

Thomson, from the highlands of the lake districts, contains many of the endemic

genera, and even species of the Cape of Good Hope. Nor does the northern re-

presentation of the south temperate flora cease within the tropics ; it extends to

the middle north temperate zone ; Chilian genera reappearing in Mexico and

California ; South African in North Africa, in the Canary Islands, and even in

Asia Minor ' ; and Australian in the Khasia Mountains of East Bengal, in East

China and Japan.

So too there is a representation of genera in the southern temperate continents,

feeble numerically, compared to what the north presents, but strong in other

respects. This isshowu by the families of Profeace;e, Cycadese, and Restiaceae,

abounding in South Africa and Australia alone, though not a single .opecies or

·even genus of these families is common to the two countries ; by New Zealand,

with a flora differing in almost every element from the Chilian, yet having a few

species of both calceolaria and fuchsia, genera  otherwise purely  Amt-rican                                                  whilst
                                                                                                                           ;

as regards Australia and New Zealand, it is difficult to say which are the most

--puzzfing the contrasts, or the similarities, which their animal and vegetable pro-

ductions present.
     These features of the vegetation of the south temperate and Antarctic regions,

though they simulate those of the north temperate and Arctic, may not originate

from precisely similar causes. In the absence of such evidence as the fossil
animals and plants of the North affords,- there is no proof that the Antarctic plants
found on the south temperate alps, or the south temperate plants found in the
mountains of the tropics, originated in the south; though this appears probable

from the absence in the south of so many of the leading families of plants and
animals of the north, no less than from the number of endemic forms the south

contains. These considerations have favoured the speculation of the former exist-

ence, during a warmer period than the present, of a centre of creation in the
Southern Ocean, in the fonn of either a continent or of an archipelago, from which
both the Antarctic and Southern endemic forms radiated. I havemyself suggested
continental or insular extension ^ as a means of aiding that wide dispersion of
species over the Southern Ocean, which it is difficult to explain without such
intervention ; and the discovery of beds of fossil trunks of trees in Kerguelen's
Island, testifies to that place "having enjoyed a warmer climate than its present

one.

     The rarity in the existlnof Archipelago (Kerguelen's Island, the Crozets, and
Prince Edward's Island) of any of the endemic genera of the south temperate

flora, or of representatives of them, is, however, an argument against such land, if

     ' Pelargonium Endlicherianum in the Taurus is a remarkable instance.
     2 The only fossil leaves hitherto found in higher southern latitudes are those of
beeches, closely allied to existing southern species, brought by Darwin ft-om Fuegia.
In one locality alone beyond the forest region of the south have fossil plants been
found ; there were silicified trunks of trees in lava beds of Kerguelen's Island (dis-
covered by myself forty years ago). It is deeply to be regretted that searches for

shales containing fossils were not made either by the ' Challenger ' expedition or by
the various ' transit of Venus ' expeditions that have recently visited this interesting

island.

it ever existed, liaviag been the birthplace of that flora ; and there are two

reasons for adopting the opposite theory, that the southern flora came from the

north temperate zone. Of these, one is the number of northern genera and species

(which, from their all inhabiting north-east Europe, I have denominated Scandi-

navian),^ that are found in all Antarctic and south temperate regions, the majority

of them in Fuegia, the flora of which country is, by means of the Andes, in the

most direct communication with the northern one. The other is the fact I have

stated above, that the several south temperate floras are more intimately related to

those of the countries north of them than they are to one another.

And this brings me to the latest propounded theoretical application of the laws

of geographical distribution. It is that recently advanced by Mr. Thiselton Dyer,

in a lecture ' On Plant distribution as a field of Geographical Research' ; - wherein
he argues that the floras of all the countries of the globe may be traced back at

some time of their history to the northern hemisphere, and that they may be

regarded in point of affinity and specialisation as the natural results of the con-

ditions to which they must have been subjected during recent geological times, on

continents and islands with the configuration of those of our globe. This hypothesis

derives its principal support from the fact that many of the most peculiar endemic

plants of the south have representatives in the north, some of them living and all

of them in a fossil state, whilst the northern endemic forms have not hitherto been

found fossil in the southern regions. So that, given time, evolution, continental

continuity, changes of climate and elevations of thie land, and all the southern types

may be traced back to one region of the globe, and that one palaeontology teaches

us is the northern.

   A very similar view has been held and published at the same time bv

Count Saporta,^ a most eminent palaeontologist, in a suggestive essay entitled

' L'Ancienne Vegetation Polaire.' Starting from Buff'on's thesis, that the cooling of

the globe having been a gradual process, and the Polar regions having cooled first,

these must have first become fit for organic life. Count Saporta proceeds to assume

that the termination of the azoic period coincided with a cooling of the waters to

the point at which coagulation of albumen does not take place, when organic life

appeared in the water itself. I have discussed Count Saporta's speculations else-

where *                           it is sufficient here                          to indicate the more important ones  as  bearing upon

distribution. These are that the Polar area was the centre of origination of all

the successive phases of vegetation that have appeared on the globe, all being

developed in the north ; and that the development of flowering plants was

enormously augmented by the introduction during the latter part of the secondary

period of flower-feeding insects, which brought about cross-fertilisation.

It remains to allude briefly to the most important general works on distribu-

tion that have appeared since the foundation of this Association. Of these, the

two which take the first rank are Professor Alphonse de CandoUe's ' Geographic

Botanique,' and Mr. AVallace's ' Geographical Distribution of Animals.' Professor

de CandoUe's work'' appeared at a critical period, when the doctrine of evolution

with natural selection had onl)' just been announced, and before the great in-

fluence of geological and climatal changes on the dispersion of living species had'

been fully appreciated ; nevertheless it is a great and truly philosophical work,

replete with important facts, discussed with full knowledge, judgment, and scrupu-

notice, namely, the chapters on the history of cultivated and introduced plants
and the further development of Humboldt's ' Arithmeticaj Botanices,' by taking
into account the sums of temperatures as well as the maxima, minima, and means,

in determining the amount of heat required to satisfy all the conditions of a plant's
life, at the various periods of its existence, and especially the maturation of its

S66QS

     Of Mr. Wallace's great work 'The Geographical Distribution of Animals,'
cannot speak with sufficient knowledge of the subject, and can pnly appreciate and

echo the high praises accorded to it by zoologists, for its scientific treatment of a

vast subject.

     The 'Geogi-aphie Botanique' was followed by the late Dr. Grisebach's 'Die
Veo'etation der Erde,'^ which contains an admirable summary of the vegetation of

the" different regions of the globe as limited by their physical features, divested of

all theoretical considerations.

     For the largest treatment in outline of the whole subject of distribution, I must

refer to the chapters of Darwin's ' Origin of Species,' which are devoted to it.

In reference to these and other works, very able and instructive discussions of

the principles of geographical distribution are to be found in the presidential
addresses delivered before the Liunean Society, in 1869, 1870, and 1872, by the

veteran botanist, G. Bentham.

With Mr. Wallace's 'Island Life' I must conclude this notice, and very

fittingly, for besides presenting an admirable account of the origin and migrations

of animals and vegetables in oceanic and continental islands, it contains a complete

and comprehensive analysis of those past and present conditions of the globe,

astronomical, geological, geographical, and biological, which have been the earlier

and  later  directors  and  controllers  of  the  ever-warring  forces  of  organic  nature.                                   In

thi.s work Mr. Wallace independently advocates the view of the northern origin of

both the faunas and floras of the world.

     I conclude with the hope that I have made the subject of the distribution of

organic life on the globe interesting to you as geographers, by showing on the one

hand how much it owes its advance to the observations made and materials
collected by geographical explorers, and on the other how greatly the student of

distribution has, by the use he has made of these observations and materials, ad-

vanced the science of physical geography.

    The equipment of a modern exploring expedition differs in many respects now

from what it was in or about the year 18.30, with the general result of increased

--efficiency and rapidity of execution. The standard instruments namely, the theo-
--dolite the sextant, the chronometer, and the azimuth compass have not received

any great improvements in the interval, and the best of those made in 1830 would
be valued now. But they are made more handy and portable than they were,
and at much lower cost for equal degrees of excellence. The modern water-tight
cover, with the keyless winding arrangement of travellers' watches, is a great
boon to them. The mercurial horizon, without which the sextant on land is

almost useless for astronomical purposes, has been transformed from a lumbering
trough shielded from the wind by a heavy glazed screen, which was difficult to
fill and did not admit of the observation of low angles, into a very compact con-
vtriyance by Captain George, which is filled by tilting, and is sheltered from the

wind by a piece of glass floating- on tlie mercury. The liability to errors introduced
by this arrangement is much smaller than might have been expected and

travellers speak highly of its merits. The appliances for measuring elevation

above the sea-level have been greatly improved. The old method was to carry a
mountain barometer, which, from the weight of the mercury and the fragility of

the glass that contained it, was rarely carried far without breakage. Siu'ce then

the aneroid has been invented, and the appliances connected with the boiling-point
Athermometer have been greatly improved.
                                                    traveller provided with these very

portable instruments can use the aneroid for everyday purposes, checking its

change of index error from time to time by boiling-point observations. Even the

mercurial barometer has been rendered a comparatively portable instrument. The

tubes are packed empty, and they are filled when required by Captain George's

method, which in moderately careful hands is found to give good results. The

enclosed thermometer for deep-sea observations is a recently invented instrument

absolutely essential to accuracy.

     The art of exploring ocean-depths and performing what has been called

Thallassography, has been immensely improved, owing to the requirements of sub-
marine telegraphy and of such scientific expeditions as that of the Challengei;

Sir W. Thomson's method of sounding at the depth of many fathoms without;

checking the ship's course is in full use, but Dr. Siemens' bathometer has not yet

been made practically serviceable.

     The accuracy of thermometric graduation has been greatly increased by the

verifications afforded by the Kew Observatory, which is the child of the British

Association, established, and for a long time maintained, by a yearly grant from

its funds, but now supported by the endowment of Mr. Gassiot. The errors in

thermometers occasionally furnished even by the best makers in 1830, were such as

would not be tolerated now. The verifications of Kew are extended to other

instruments, and the influence of the Observatory for good is firmly established and
appears to be yearly increasing. Of the other appliances for geographical travellers

--such as scales for plotting, metal pens which were invented since 1830, and that
--admirable recent contrivance the stylographic pen it is unnecessary to speak in

detail. The binocular opera-glass is, practically speaking, a new instrument, and its

merits as a night-glass were first found out long after 1830, The lunar tables of
the ' Nautical Almanack ' have been greatly improved of late years, for in 1830

their predictions of the place of the moon could not have been trusted as they now

are for delicate determinations of longitude. Lastly, the means of instruction in the

use of geographical instruments is at length afforded by the Geographical Society,

who have erected a small observatory on the roof of their premises, where

instruction is given on moderate terras to intending travellers.

The modern equipment of travellers as regards dress has been greatly improved

by the general use of flannel, which is a most important preservative of health,

but was neglected half a century ago. Thus, at much more recent times thau

1830, the hardy Swiss guides had a horror of what they called a coup-cTair, or a

chill on the mountain-top, when they were hot and perspiring ; and no wonder, as

they then all wore linen shirts next the skin. The modern loose form of dress,

the shooting boots and easy overcoat, are a vast improvement on the pinched

costumes of 1830. The derivation of the word paletot conveys a history. The
first warm and convenient coats used in England were reproductions long subse-

quent to 1830 of those used by sailors in rough weather under the name of ' pilot

coats (and                       were sometimes, for the sake of shortness, called  ' p.  coats ' or ' pea-
                              '

coats '). They quickly became the fashion, were copied and made more eles:antly

by the French, who adapted our name of ' pilot coat ' to their own pronunciation

of paletot, and so we received it back from them. India-rubber and gutta-percha

adaptations to articles of dress and manufactures generally date from a little

subsequent to 1830 ; they are invaluable for many purposes to exploring expe-

ditions. The form of tent has been greatly improved. Portable mackintosh and

other boats are comparatively recent contrivances, and have done good service,

Lucifer- matches had been invented, but only very recently, in 1830.

chiefly through Australian experiences, where, moreover, the camel has been
introduced as a beast of burden, with more success than the tamed elephant iu
Africa, The art of sledge-travelling has been vastly improved by the skilful cut-

ting down of all superfluous weight, enabling travellers to drag more food, and
so to be absent from their depots for a larger number of days.

     As regards food, the tinned meats, compressed vegetables, and condensed milk,
which are invaluable during the first days of travel before the expedition has
settled into regular ways, are all late inventions, and the merits of lime-juice are
now far better understood than they were fifty years ago.

     The persminel of a travelling party is decidedly improved. Whatever may be the

state of the physique of the lower orders of the population, there can be no doubt
that the upper orders are physically better developed than they were. They are,
as I have good reason to believe, in the absence of direct measurements, taller
they achieve greater feats in running, leaping, walking, and other athletic perform-
ances than their grandfathers did. They lead healthier lives from the discontinu-

ance of the heavy eating and hard drinking of old days, from the better aired
sleeping rooms, the existence of proper means of washing, and the seaside or Con-
tinental summer vacation.

     The greatest benefit of all to travellers is the modern rapidity and ease with
which distant parts of the world are now reached. In 1830 it required 70 days
sailing from England to reach the Cape of Good Hope, 120 days (in the S.W.
monsoon) to reach Bombay, and 130 days to Sydney. It was 40 days' sail to

New York, 42 to Jamaica, 66 to Rio, and 110 to Valparaiso. The length of

time that the post now takes from London to these places is as follows : Cape

Town 21 days, Bombay 18 days, Sydney 43 days, New York 10 days, Jamaica IS

days, Rio 21 days. Valparaiso 39 days ; the average increase of speed being more

than threefold. There is scarcely any important part of the world that cannot

now be reached in two months from London ; even the Antipodes are only six

weeks' journey. This facility of communication is accompanied by a corresponding

spread of commerce, and travellers can now easily refit themselves at distant

points. It has recently occurred to the Geographical Society to have had to meet
bills drawn upon her Majesty's consul at Zanzibar by a traveller in their employ,
for which he had been furnished with goods by Arab traders at Nyangwe on the
Upper Congo, as well as at places in Central Africa which had never before been
visited by a white man.

           2. Isoclironic Postal Charts. By Feancis Galton, F.B.S.

    By ' isochronic ' postal charts I mean charts that show the distances attained

in all directions from the same starting point, by the post, 'in equal times.' Let

us view in imagination the stream of travellers who leave London simultaneously

and go as quickly as they can to their destinations, starting by the postal routes.
Some of the travellers will be seen to leave the main lines at each successive
halting-place, and to branch to the right and to the left, perhaps repeatedly

and by various conveyances, before their journey is over. Thev may reach the

same goal by diflPerent routes, though not at the same moment. In the meantime the
travellers on the main tracks are swiftly moving ahead. At length every part of

the world is reached. The course of the stream of travellers may be likened to
the spreading of the tide as it advances over broad sands. The rising waters run

quickly along certain channels. These diverge, subdivide, interlace, and join.
After a little more time only a few isolated patches of dry shore can be seen, at last
the whole surface is overspread by the water. In the maps I exhibit, I have en-
deavoured to represent this appearance upon all the postal routes from London.

In accordance with the definition of 'isochronic' given above, I am obliged to

suppose that the mails have been despatched simultaneously to all parts, and I
show by bands of different colours where the travellers would be at different
periods. All places within ten days' journey of London are coloured green, those
between ten and twenty are orange, between twenty and thirty they are red,
between thirty and forty they are blue, and those beyond forty are brown.

        3. On the GeorjrapMcal Work of tlie Palestine Ex;plomtion Fund.

                                 By Tkelawney Saunders.

     The author gave an account of the survey of Western Palestine, to which the
Association had contributed, conducted by Lieutenant Oonder and Lieutenant
Kitchener, and now completed. It embraced nearly the extent attributed to the
Land of Canaan, in the earliest specification of a geographical boundary to be found
in Biblical history, viz., in the 10th chapter of Genesis. After an elaborate sketch
of the work of earlier e-xplorers, be proceeded to describe the siu-vey of Lieutenants
Conder and Kitchener. This had occupied from 1872 to 1877, and was executed on
the scale of one inch to a mile, and he believed that when the great difficulties
which the task had involved were considered--difficulties of climate, race, and
fanaticism--the map would be found to possess a fuhiess and acciu-acy far beyond
that of any other previously executed. It was now possible to luidertake a syste-
matic analysis of the natural features of the ground, its watercourses and drainage-

basins, its plains and highlands, with a degree of precision and detail that was pre-
viously imattaiuable for lack of knowledge.

1. On the Proc/ress of Geography in Asia during the last fifty years.
             By Sir Richard Temple, Bart., G.G.8.L, F.B.G.'S.

The author described the physical geography of Asia, and pointed out the portions

which, during the last half-century, had been sm-veyed, partially siu'veyed, or only

explored. As regards India and Ceylon great progress had beeii made. From the

base of the Himalayan range to the southernmost cape nearest Ceylon, the British

territories have been mapped, for the most part, with as much minuteness as tlie

best managed estates in Europe.  The     great rivers are well known                                                                                                           the altitude of

many of the highest mountain-peaks has been determined. The coimtry has been

covered with a network of triangles, a large arc of the meridian determined, the

geodesic contour of the land ascertained. In two provinces only, Bengal and

Behar, is the field-survey wanting. The geography of Afghanistan and Beluchis-

tan is, however, utterly incomplete. The territory here is not only difficult from

its mountainous character, cold climate in many quarters, and desert character in

others, but also rendered inaccessible to surveying parties by the fierce character of

its inhabitants. During the recent war, however, a surveying staft" was attached to

the military establishment, by whom the route was siu-veyed and valuable results

obtained. Still the work in Afghanistan is very incomplete. The geography of

Beluchistan is even less advanced. Of the north-eastern portion considerable know-

ledge has been gained of late years. The Chinese have bestowed much labour on

topography, but their siu-veys have not been scientific, their maps not precise, and

the general geography is not exactly determined. The grave changes which have

been brought about in Japan have led to a greatly increased knowledge of those

islands. The Russian Government has done much in the northern parts of Asia.
The physical geography of Persia is, as yet, very imperfectly kno-WTi. The author

passed on to notice the nautical and geological sm-veys, concluding by pointing

out the principal problems that yet await solution.

2. On the 'Hot-Jake District and the Glacier Scenery and Fjords of New
            Zealand. By "Wii. Lant Carpenter, B.A., B.Sc, F.G.8.

    The author had visited New Zealand in December 1880, and through the kindness

of prominent men there had been able to see and learn a great deal, and had brought
home a series of excellent photographs of places but rarely visited. These were
exhibited. The lines of volcanic action in the North Island were first explained,
and the general characteristics of the centre of the island were pointed out. The
sm-face was composed either of acid volcanic or post-tertiary sedimentary rocks.
The water-supply of the Hot-lake District was Lake Taupo, with an area of 248

square miles, 1,250 feet above the sea, with a depth considerably greater than that,
through which ran the river Waikato, and from which subterranean channels led.

-- --Aroimd its shores were many hot sprmgs geysers 100 feet high mud volcanoes,

fumaroles, &c. In the river valley'76 hot springs were visible from one station.
The Hot-lake District proper was" 40 miles N.N.E. of Taupo, about 240 square

--miles in extent, containing 16 lakes. Two were described Rotorua, the largest,

and Rotomahana, celebrated for its marvellous and unique terraces of nearly pure
silica, deposited from intermittent hot springs that burst out about 100 feet above
the lake, the basin of one of which was larger than that of the Great Geyser in
Iceland. These were described in some detail, and the composition of the springs,

Aas well as of the deposit (analysed by the writer), was remarked upon.

remarkable ravine, whose bottom was hot mud, with blocks of siliceous sinter

--floating therein, was noticed, and also the ' steaming ranges,' and this part con-

cluded with a short description of White Island, where was a lake whose water
contained more than 10,000 grains of hydrochloric acid in a gallon (!) with large
deposits of sidphur and sulphate of lime in the neighbourhood.

      The Southern Alps were then generally described, running the whole length of
the South Island, the highest peaks of which ranged from 10,000 to nearly 14,000
 feet, with a snow line at about 8,000 feet. The enormous snow-fields and huge
glaciers lying between 43° and 44° S. and 170° and 171° E. were noticed, as well
as the evidences of past glacial action on a much grander scale, given by the

glacier-formed lakes and fjords on the SW. coast, as well as by the huge moraines.

The backbone of the whole was granitic, but on the side-slopes lay the older
palaeozoic rocks. Some of the existing glaciers were upwards of 18 miles long.
 In lat. 43° 35' S., corresponding to that of Marseilles or Leghorn, a glacier de-
scended to within 705 feet of the sea. The characteristics of the river-system that
 flowed from these were described, and instances given of theh* liability to sudden
 flood, and to rapid and great changes of bed, rendering it impossible to bridge them.
The paper concluded Avith a notice of the rarely visited ' Sound ' scenery of the
 S.W. coast, which in general appearance resembled that of Norse fjords, but the
 Sounds were not so long, although the clifl" and mountain scenery was in many in-

 stances finer, sheer precipices of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, or upwards, rising from the

 sea, with mountains of 8,000 to 9,000 feet. The whole of this district was granitic,
 and the water at the head of the Sounds was deeper than at their entrances, indi-

 cating glacial excavation.

 1. On tJie Progress of Arctic BesearcJi since the Foundation of the British
            Association. By Clements E. Makkham, C.B., F.B.S.

     The author, having pointed out that Martm Frohisher, Marmaduke, James Cook,

 Scoresby, and other noted Arctic explorers were Yorkshiremen, passed on to say

that in 1831 the Asiatic coasts withm the frigid zone had abeady heen delineated
 by the Russians. But on the American side only portions had been traced by
Franklin, Back, Richardson, and Beechey. Much difficult work had to be done
before the complete outline of Arctic America coidd be laid down. The western
and northern shores of Spitzbergen had long been known, Ross had rediscovered
Baffin's Bay and so vindicated the fame of that gallant old navigator, and Parry
had pressed westward for 300 miles to Melville Island, on a meridian far to the
north of the American continent. Lastly, the Rosses were engaged in the dis-
covery of Boothia and King WiUiam Island. Not only was the whole vast region
to the north of 82° entirely unknown, but also extensive tracts to the southward
of that parallel, especially between Parry's westward track and the American
coast. The period covered by the labours of the British Association, and of its

contemporary the Royal Geographical Society, has been a period of great though
fitful activity in the work of filling up these blanks and of increasing our Arctic
knowledge. In the present century, the north-west and north-east passages have
been sought in order that scientific knowledge might be extended, that the rela-
tions between land and sea over a vast area might be understood, together with the
numerous other interesting facts connected with a previously unknown region.
Increase of knowledge is the great object of Ai'ctic discovery; an object than which

none can be more useful, none more praiseworthy and when once the attempt to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

secure it has been commenced, our efforts ought never to be relaxed until the great
end in view is fully attained. After tracing Arctic discovery from 1830 to 1854

and dwelling particularly on the Franklin search expeditions, Mr. Markham said

the latter performed an enormous amount of valuable scientific work, adding
materially to the sum of human knowledge, in addition to the performance of
the humane mission on which they were primarily employed. The ample
experience which was then acquired established the true methods for future

polar search, which are now formulated into three Arctic Canons. The first is

that, for satisfactory and complete results, an expedition must pass at least one
winter in the ice in order to obtain a complete series of observations. The second is
that full results as regards geology, zoology, botany, and geography can only be
secured by the despatch of extended sledge-travelling parties. The third is that
to reach an advanced position within the unknown area, it is necessary to follow a
coast-line, trending northwards, with a westerly aspect. These three canons are
equally important, but the last rule is that which has the most interest to the
geographical inquirer. The experience of three centuries has tauglit us that inevit-
able faihu'e and probable disaster are the consequences of pushing into the ice-floes
away from land, while a successful advance is secured by keeping to a coast-line.
Fiu-ther, it is held that the best prospect of success is alforded by advancing along
a coast trending northwards, with a westerly aspect. Sucli coast-lines usually
have channels of open water along tliem, during some part of the navigable season.
This fact in physical geography is ably discussed by Sir Edwary Parry in his re-
--744
          REPOET 1881.

marks at the conclusion of the narrative of his third voyage. He had observed

that the eastern coast of any land trending north and south was more encumbered

with ice than shores having an opposite aspect. The east coasts of Greenland,

Spitzbergen, and Novaya Zemlya are more or less blocked with ice throughout the
summer, while navigation along the western coasts may annually be performed

without difficulty. The west side of Fox's Channel, along Melville Peninsula, is

loaded with ice, but there is little or no ice on the east side. In Prince Regent's

Inlet ice always clings to the western shore of the channel, while the opposite

shore is comparatively free from it. In Behring Strait the same fact has been

observed. On the American side the water is comparatively warmer, and is navig-

able every summer to Point Barrow, while the Asiatic side is usually blocked with

Aice. general motion of the sea towards the west causes the ice to set in that direc-

tion, when not impelled l)y contrary winds or local currents ; and Sir Edward

Parry suggested that this constant westerly motion was connected witli the motion

of the earth on its axis. Mr. Markham went on to review the expeditions made,

Weand the work achieved between 1858 and 1876, and proceeded :  find that in

every particular the results of the Arctic Expedition of 1875-76 justified the antici-

pations based upon former knowledge and experience. The examination of that por-

tion of the previously unknown area which could be reached by the Smith Sound

route was satisfactory, and completed the work in that direction. Consequently

those reasons for continuing polar discovery which led to the despatcli of the last ex-

pedition are now as strong as they ever were. Since the return of Sir George Nares

in 1876, the greatest northern achievement has been the voyage of Professor Nor-

denskjijld along the north-east passage. The gi-eat Swedish explorer liad prepared

for this enterprise by the most exhaustive study of the subject in all its bearings,

and by two voyages of reconnaissance, so that lie may almost be said to ha'\e

commanded success. The results of the voyage of the Ver/a are most valuable, as

confirming and piecing together all previous work, and establishing the broad facts

bearing on the hydrography of the Siberian Arctic Sea. Passing all this briefly

in review, we have before us the results of Arctic enterprise during the period

which embraces the labours of the British Association. In 18-31 there were only

unconnected and isolated discoveries in various directions. Now there is some

approach to generalisation, to a comprehension of the geography of the Arctic

regions, so far as discovery has extended, as a whole. This is the great result.

We must study the means of reaching another coast-line trending northwards into

tlie unknown region, with a western aspect. Looliing round the circle which

divides the unknown from the known, we find another such land in the Franz-.Josef

Land discovered by Payer and Weyprecht, There was an apparent difficulty in

reaching this land because its most southern shore is in 80° N., almost as far north

as the most northern part of Spitzbergen, and an ice-laden sea intervenes between

the open water and the first base of operations. But this ice-laden sea is known

to be navigable in August and September. This was proved by Payer in 1871, by
the Dutch Expedition in 1878, by Captain Markham in 1879, and l)y Mr. Leigh
Smith in 1880, when he reached Franz-Josef Land in a steamer, made important

discoveries along it in August, and ascertained that the furthest western land he

saw trended north and west. Mr. Leigh Smith has again sailed this year in the

same steamer, still further to demonstrate that a base of operations on Franz-Josef

Land may generally be reached, in an ordinary season. From this base a steamer
may advance northwards along the west coast, and all experience leads to tlie

belief that so long as that coast trends in a northerly direction, a steamer may, in

Amost seasons, succeed in making her way along it.  vast field of discovery will

thus be opened, promising all the valuable results that have ever been anticipated

from polar research. By this route we have the prospect of the attainment of a

very high northern latitude for winter quarters, the exploration of an unknown

and peculiarly interesting region by means of sledges, and security for a safe

retreat.

2. On the Commercial Importance of Hudson's Bay, with liemarJcs on
      recent Surveys and Investigations. By Robeet Bell, M.D.

Few people have any adequate conception of the extent of this great American

sea. Including its southern prolongation, James' Bay, it measures ahout 1,000

miles in length, and is more than GOO miles in width at its northern part. Its

total area is ahout 500,000 square miles, or upwards of half that of the Mediterra-

nean Sea in the ' old world ' hemisphere. It is enclosed hy the land on all sides

except the north-east, where it communicates by several channels with the outer

ocean. The principal or best known of these is Hudson's Strait, which is about

500 miles in length, and has an average width of about 100 miles. The resources

of Hudson's Bay and the country immediately around it are varied and numerous,

although as yet few of them are at all developed. The fur trade is the principal

and best known business which has hitherto been carried on in these regions ; but a

large amount of oil, derived from the larger whales, the porpoises, walruses, white

bears, and the various species of seals which frequent the northern parts of the

bay, has been carried to New England, and small quantities, principally of porpoise

and seal oil, have from time to time been brought to London by the Hudson's Bay

Company. The other exports from the bay have been as yet but trifling. The

fisheries, properly speaking, of Hudson's Bay have not yet been investigated. Both

the Indians and Eskimos tiud a variety of fish for their own use, and fine salmon

ahoimd in the rivers of Hudson's Strait. Watei'-fowl are very numerous on both

sides of the bay, and larger game on the ' barren grounds ' in the northern parts,
so that the natives, with prudence, may always have a plentiful supply of food.

But perhaps the most important of the undeveloped resources of the country

around the bay are its soil, timber, and minerals. To the south and west of James'

Bay, in the latitude of Devonshire and ("ornwall, there is a large tract, in which

much of the land is good, and the climate sufficiently favourable for the successful

Aprosecution of stock and dauy farming.  strip of country along the east side of

James' Bay may also prove available for these purposes. To the south-west of the

wide part of the bay the country is well-wooded, and although little or no rock

comes to the surface over an immense area, still neither the soil nor the climate are

suitable for carrying on agriculture as a principal occupation until we have passed

over more than half the distance to Lake Winnipeg. This region, however, offers

no engineering difficidties to the construction of a railway from the sea-coast to the

better country beyond, and this, at present, is the most important point in reference

to it. Some of the timber found in the country which sends its waters into James'

Bay, may prove to be of value for export. Among the kinds which it produces
may be mentioned white, red, and pitch pine, black and white spruce, balsam, larch,

white cedar, and white birch. The numerous rivers converging tow^ards the head

of James' Bay offer facilities for 'driving' timber to points at which it may be

shipped by sea-going vessels. Minerals may, lioweA'er, become in the future the

gi-eatest of the resources of Hudson's Bay. Little direct search has as yet been

made for the valuable minerals of these regions. I have, however, found a large
deposit of rich u-onstone on the Mattigami River, inexhaustible supplies of good man-

ganiferous iron ore on the islands near the east main coast, and promising quantities

of galena around Eichmond Gulf and also near Little Whale Kiver, where a small

amount had previously been known to exist. I have likewise noted traces of gold,

silver, molybdenum, and copper. Lignite is met with on the Missinaibi, gypsum on

the Moose, and petroleum-bearing limestone on the Abittibi River. Small quan-

tities of anthracite, and various ornamental stones and rare minerals, have been

met with in the course of my explorations. Soapstone is abundant not far from

Mosquito Bay, on the east side, and iron pyrites between Churchill and Marble

Island, on the west. Good building stones, clays, and limestones exist on both
Asides of the bay.
                    cargo of mica is said to have been taken from Chesterfield

Inlet to New York, and valuable deposits of plumbago are reported to occur on

the north side of Hudson's Strait.

The author concluded by discussing the facilities of access to this district, point-

ing out that the formation of ice in the harbours during the winter was the main

obstacle to continuous commerce by sea.

1. Comparative sTcetch of what was hiotvn in Africa in 1830 with what is

       Jcnown in 1881. By Lieut.-Colonel J. A. Grant, C.B., F.B.8.

The author said that in fifty years a great deal had been done towards opening out

the centre of Africa as well as its suiTOimdings. There were no lights or lighthouses

around Africa prior to 1855, whereas now there were 129 harbour lights, all of

which were mauitained. The tu-st light was erected at Cape Coast Castle. The

soiu'ces of the Nile, the Niger, the Congo, the Zambesi, and the Limpopo had been
Adiscovered.
              dozen lakes of great magnitude, and the whole physical aspect and

resoui'ces of the continent, were now tolerably well known. The cutting of the

mSuez Canal, which was opened 1869, had had a most beneficial eSect upon the

continent. The discovery of Lake Tictoria Nyanza in 1863 was an event of great

magnitude, and Captain Speke and the reader of the paper were enabled to put at

rest the theories as to the soui-ce of the Nile, as they found that the parent of the

Nile took its rise in the newly-discovered lakes. Speaking of the labours of Sir

Samuel Baker and J\L-. H. M. Stanley, Colonel -Grant said that the benefits of those

laboiu's would be reaped in after years. The almost insurmoimtable labour they

went through in putting steamers upon the Victoria Nyanza would be of un-

told advantage hereafter. Speaking of Cape Colonj-, the author said that the

slave trade had been abolished in 1808, but slaves were sold until December, 1834,

when all slaves were emancipated in British dominions. The colony since those

days has made immense progress. The additions to knowledge of successive dis-

coverers were described in detail.

               2. Some Results of Fifty Years' Exploration in Africa.

                             By the Rev. Hobace Waller.

     Geographical interest fifty years since chiefly centred upon the countries lying

between the western fringe of the Sahara Desert and the Atlantic ; indeed the

Nigev river absorbed most of the enthusiasm which had been aroused by Denham and
Clapperton. It was in the year 1830, the year of the Society's bii'th, that Lander
traced the Niger to the sea. The countries bordering upon the western coast of

the Sahara Desert, which are watered by the Niger and its tributaries, have an
interest peculiarly their own. The travels of Captain Vincent, of Barth, Overwig,
Richardson, and others between 1849 and 1857, show that the comparatively
advanced state of civilisation which prevails in these densely populated districts
maj- be due to the very great difficulty of communicating with the French settle-
ments on the west and the British possessions to the south-west. For ages the
strict Moslems of these lands have preferred to draw those supplies which are
needed amongst the Berber tribes in Timbuctoo, in Barin, Kuka, and other cities,
from the marts of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. There, at all events, Arab met
Arab. The additions to oiu- previous knowledge of the Fari coimtry and the
Gaboon river were mainly seciu-ed to us bv the adventurous exploits of M. Paul de
haillu in the years 1857, 1865, and 1867. From 1866 to the present date the

 Frencli have been liusy on tlie Ogorvi. The Marquis de Compeigne in the year
 1874 saw enough to make it probable that the great body of water which it
 carried to the sea was drained from no very distant area. They must, however,
 continue to look for the reports of the intelligent French ofhcers under Count de
 Brazza before they coidd trace the course of the river for any great distance in-
land. Some particulars of the so-called Congo country had been acquired by Mr.
Grandy, who traversed part of it when under the auspices of the Royal Geographi-
cal Society ; but, at the sole cost of Dr. Young, he went in 1874 to seek for Dr,
Livingstone, who it was imagined would probably come out that way. The news
of Livingstone's death rendered further progress unnecessary. Painstaking work
characterised the endeavom-s of Mr. Walker to explore the Okanda in 1866, and

the same must be said of Lieutenant Serval previously, in 1802. Both France and
Germany had vied with each other in projecting scientific discoveries in these
regions under Compeigne, March, and Gussi'eldt, but that success had not attended
them which they could have desii-ed. The great discovery of the diamond fields, in
1869, had a tendency to eclipse the work done by such travellers as Elton, Vincentj

Erskine, Mohr, Motfatt, and Mackenzie, but nobody who had watched the qviestion

could fail to see what March had done, for instance in his searching for gold, or
what the influence of John Mackenzie had been for good amongst the Bamangwato
people. The results of Livingstone's travels were summarized. The discoveries of
Speke, Sir Samuel Baker, Grant, Stanlej', Cameron, and others, were also noticed.
The work of Stanley, he said, was to clear up several gaps in the explorations of

Burton, Speke, and Grant, and thenceforward to timi his attention to the waters of

the Lualaba. He visited the Victoria Nyanza, and examined its western boundarj-,

and spent some time at the capital of Uganda. Shortly after he discovered Lake
Alexandra, and then fell back on Lake Tanganyka. Passing to the spot described
by Cameron as the Lukuga, he proceeded in a north-westerly du-ection until he

--finally found himself embarked upon the greater venture his descent of the

Lualaba. He overcame obstacles of everj- kind, and made that remarkable voyage

to the sea which they would always think on with amazement. Later work of
great value has been done upon the lakes Nyanza and Tanganyka, and oiu- last

intelligence is extremely "\-aluable and interesting.

                     1. On Societies of Commercial Oeography,
                            By EmvAED J. Watheeston.

     The author traced the progress of the German societies of ' Commercial Geo-
graphy ' (Vereine I'iir Handelsgeographie), estahlished in Berlin towards the end of
1878, by Dr. Jaunasch, a well-known political economist and statistician. These

societies already have agents in all parts of the world, a ' centralverein ' in Berlin,
and several periodicals supported by their members ; one, ' The Export,' abounding

in information to merchants and manufacturers ; another, called ' Geogi-aphische
Nachrichten fUr welthaudel und Volkswirthschaft,' and a thu-d, ' Ilandelsgeogra-

--phisches Museum,' lately publislied. The objects of the societies are twofold first,

to give their members, nearly all merchants and manufacturers, the latest reliable

information relating to the chaimels into which the export trade of the country

should be directed ; secondly, to establish agencies in all the principal commercial
towns in the world.

      This is done after the model of our famous Lloyd's, In like manner as Lloyd's

agents report concerning ships, shipwreclis, and all matters relating to navigation,

to the headquarters in London, so the German agents send in reports upon all mat-

ters relating to the commercial requirements of their districts to the ' Centralverein

ftir  Handelsgeographie                                                                                          in  Berlin,  which    reports  are   published  in  fidl  in      the ' Geo-
                                                                                                              '

graphische Nachrichten,' sold to non-members for the sum of two marks, or 2s.
The list of agents includes some of the most eminent Germans settled abroad, men

of scientific renown, anxious for their country's welfare. Last year the societies held

a ' Congress' at Berlin, and the speeches, reported at fuU length in a ' Bericht fiber

die Verhandlimgen des Ersten Congresses fur Handelsgeographie,' show the progress
which has been made in an attempt to seciu-e for Germany commercial relations
with the entire world.

   --Our own and other Governments, doubtless, are doing much to supply an ad-

mitted want viz., a knowledge of foreign manufactming and commercial capacities

and requirements. The British Government, for example, publish every year a host

similar are the ' Reports from H.M. Consuls on the Manufactures, Commerce, &e.,

and half a score of other Blue-books, descrihed variously as ' Statistical Abstracts,'

' Agricultural Returns,' ' Special Reports,' and under other names.

But vast as is the information afforded, their very vastness makes them all but
whom^iseless to the classes
                             they are intended to serve.  Time is wanted to digest

the details, and, moreover, the Blue-books are made the more unavailing to pract'ical
men of business, in that not one of them has so much as an index to guide the reader

tlirough its mazes. Similar publications of foreign Governments are better edited,

notably those of the United States, of Germany, and of Italy. The author strongly

advocated the early establishment of similar institutions in tha United Kingdom

trade, as he believed, not requiring protection, but development.

  --To begin with, our own Blue-books--together with those of Germany, Italy,

and France should be made useful, by concentration and extracts, to our mercantile
community, who at present scarcely know of their existence.

2. Corn or Cattle : a Comparison of the Econoviic Results of Agriculture and

     Cattle-raising in relation to National Food-supply.^ By William E. A.

      Axon, M.B.S.L., F.S.8.

     The people of Great Britain are largely dependent for dailv bread upon supplies
from foreign sources, and the proportion of imported over "home-grown foods is

steadily increasing. So marked, indeed, has this tendencv become in late years, that
an American publicist has roundly asserted that 'if every acre of land in the British
Isles were cuhivated to its utmost capacity, the inliab'itants could not raise food

sufficient to supply the common necessaries of life.'

     The amount of land in tiie United Kingdom devoted to permanent pasture is

24,717,092 acres, calculated to produce, at the rate of 501b. of flesh-meat per acre,
1,235,854,600 lb., which, at Mr. Greg's estimate of consumption of Sib. per daj-,

shows a sustaming power for 1,128,6.34 persons per annum. The cf-rn crops cover
10,672,086 acres, and the average yield of grain would be 17,929,10-;,4801b., which
at 2 lb. per head per day would feed 24,560,417 persons. Hence, without reckoning
at all on the green crops, we have a sustaining power for 25§ millions of persons.

      There have been various estimates as to the extent of English food-production.
Mr. Caird supplied figm-es from which, in 1877, ]\Ir. Stephen Bourne calculated the
average corn-growth at 54,000,000 cwts. ; but it is a gradually decreasing quantity.
Mr. Bourne further reckons the growth of English flesh-meat at 25i million cwts., a

much higher estimate than would fbllow' from" the basis adopted by Mr. Greg.
     But let us suppose the present process by which corn-growing districts have

gradually been converted into grazing lands to continue until the entire available

surface is devoted to cattle-raising. The total of arable and pasture acreage of the
United Kingdom, in 1880, was 47,586,700, which, at a production of 50 lb. weight
of butchers' meat per annum, would give a net result of 2,379,335,000 lb., or an
amount sufficient, at 3 lb. per day, to feed 2,172,908 persons. If mankind were ex-
clusively carnivorous, a much larger quiintitv would be required. The Canadian
boatmen and the Esquimaux," when deprived of other food, consume from six to
eight pounds daily. If, however, instead of being devoted to cattle-raising, we-
suppose the same acreage to be under corn crops, and to produce on an averao&
1,4201b. to the acre, we have an annual return of 67,673,114,0001b., or an amount
sufficient, at two pounds per day, ^o fe^d 9f^702,g96 persons. After leaving an
ample margin for any diversity of qpinioji as t.o the base§ of fiuch calculations, it is
clear that there is sufficient material ii; our own land for the food of its people.
The real remedy for over-population is food reform. Thus Dr. C. D. Hunter argues
that 42 men could be supported on 100 acres devoted to sheep-raising, 53 on a
dairy farm, 250 on wheat, and 683 on potatoes.

     The British farmer, in face of 'the competition of clieap foreign-grown corn, has
turned his attention more and more to cattle-raising, but there are not wanting

                                      have taken cost as a measure of value, and,

the luxurious habits of their wealthier neighbours, the poor are spending upon beef
and bacon the money which would be much better employed in the purchase of
the fruits of the earth. The diffusion of knowledge on the relative values of
various knnds of food may be expected to correct some of the evils arising from the
present popular errors as to tlie necessity of a flesh diet, or its superiority oyer
one derived ft'om fruits or cereals. The productiveness of the land might be im^
proved by the removal of legislative hindrances to its free culture, and by returning
to it the excreta of our teeming populations. The encouragement of fruit-growing

is as legitimate an object of national concern as the development of fisheries.

5. A General Banhing Law for the United Kingdom. By Wir. Westgaeth.

The condition of banking law in this country is most unsatisfactory, owino- to
the complete want of uniformity in banking constitution. It is not necessary by
law for any of our very many banks to be constituted alike, and thus every bank is

of necessity a separate and not seldom a rather intricate study for anyone havino-

dealings with it. Again, the  banking  law   is  different  respectively         for Eno°-land
Scotland, and Ireland.

     Considering how general banking now is, and that the public may be regarded

as composed mainly of bankers and their- customers, simplicity and uniformity of

banking constitution have become a necessity. At present, for example, the pro-
fessed capital and share of a bank may give us the following almost inte3-minable
variety. The capital may be paid-up capital, or it may be partly of that kind and
partly of what is called Liability Capital; and this latter kind of so-called capital
may be of two sorts, namely, a capital that may be called up by the bank, and a
' Reserve' capital that may not be called except in insolvency or liquidation ; and
these three different kinds of capital may be in any proportion one to another.
Then again, the bank share, besides being constituted variously like the capital, of

mwhich it IS a small section, may be further in endless variety of amount, no one

bank this respect, any more than in others, being bound to resemble another.
     But banking is substantially one kind of business throughout the countrj-, and

therefore may admit of the great convenience of a more simple and uniform consti-

tution. Towards this attainment, the term capital should have but one meaning,

namely that of paid-up capital, which, if we except the ever-clashing theories of

professed economists, and the confusing license of present banking law, is the
meaning generally given to the word. Then as to the bank share, it might be
uniformly of one and the same amount, and that some considerable amount, say 100^.
The tendency of large shares is to give a responsible proprietary, and such is only
due to the public fi-om a bank. Lastly, as to liability, there ought to be somethino-
beyond paid-up capital, while on the other hand, public opinion has decided ao-ainst
unluuited liability. Above all, there ought to be uniformity of liability, bo'th in
kind and amount, so as to be easily intelligible to all.

    Upon these lines, the proposed General Banking Law for the United Kin^-dom

was to consist mainly of three clauses ; first, the banking tei-m Capital to mean
always and only, Paid-up Capital; second, the Bank Sliare^o be uniformly of 100/ ·

thu-d. Liability to be of the ' Reserve ' kind only, and equal to amount of Capital.'
     All the banks of the United Kingdom might at once adjust themselves to such

m& law by mere nominal changes in capital and share. This would not, however

   the compulsory sense, be either fair or reasonable in many existing cases of bank-

ing diversities, and tlie law would therefore cbiefly concern new banks. But there
would probably soon be a disposition in tlie pre-existing banks to place themselves

in conformity with a law so universal and intelligible.

 it is not the fiftieth anniversary of the Section to which we more especially belong.
 That Section was called into life at the Cambridge meeting in 18.3.3, a year which
 will be long famous in Enjilish history in connection with a movement of a very
 different kind, a movement which was, indeed the expression of the distrust
 excited in many minds bj' our parents. Science and Liberalism.

    We were at first entirely devoted to statistics, to tlie ' investigation,' to use the

 words of the official recommendation of the Section, ' of facts relating to com-
munities of men which are capable of being expressed by numbers, and which
 promise, when sufficiently multiplied, to indicate general laws,' and Professor
 Sedgwick, the President of the Association for 18-33, in the address with which he

 closed the proceedings, carefully limited the functions of the Section to the

inquiries which furnish 'the raw material of political economy and political

 philosophy.'

     Our first President was Mr. Babbage, who lived on into our own times, and
whom some who are here present must have known well, whilst among the names
of those who gathered round him as a committee were those of Empson, Hallam,

Jones, Malthus, and Lubbock.
      Hardly had our Section itself been created than it produced the Statistical

Society, which, in the words of a speaker at tlie Edinburgh meeting in 1834,
' acknowledged itself the oflspring of this institution/ and was indeed one of its

first definite residts.

     At the Dublin meeting~in 1836, our Section was again presided over by Mr.
Babbage, who read a paper upon a subject which was destined to become, some-
what later, of great importance, on an experiment, namely, in the creation of
co-operative shops for the supplying workmen with the necessaries of life, which,
begun as far back as 1812, had come to an end in 1832.

     On this occasion, too, appears, for the first time in our records, the honoured
name of Mr. William Bathbone Greg, then a very young man, who became, iu
after years, so well known as a writer upon some of the questions with which
we are occupied, and wlio contributed a paper on the ' Social Statistics of the

Netherlands.'

   We are reminded of the vast changes which have taken place in our times

when we observe, that at the Bristol meeting in 1837, Dr. Lardner pointed out as

if it was a great matter, that the introduction of railways between various points
had actually increased the number of travellers between those points in the

proportion of four to one.

     At Liverpool in 1837, a committee was appointed for the advancement of
Statistical Science, and the Biitish Association volume for that year contains a
report on the statistics of the Deccan by Colonel Sykes, which was creditable for
its dav ; but the proceedings of our Section at Newcastle in 18.38 were of little

interest.

    In 1839, when we met at Birmingham, we had the honour to have Mr. Hallam

for our chairman; but no record of anything which that great historian said or
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  753

read on the occasion seems to have been preserved, nor are the minutes of the
Glasffow meeting in 1840 at all more interesting.

     The meeting of our Section at Plymouth, in 1841, produced nothing that
invites remark, but in the volume for 1842 there is a Report on the Vital Statistics

of the large towns of Scotland, drawn up under the authority of some of the
members of Section F, which had a certain importance.

     Our Section was not very active at the Cork meeting in 1843, nor again when
we met in this city in 1844.

     The proceedings in 184o, 1846 and 1847 were somewhat more notable, but are
very briefly reported, and the same may be said of all the years up to and inclusive

of 1855. Observe that I am far from admitting that they were not useful in their

day, as stimulating discussion and leading to valuable legislation. They have had
the fate of the heroes who lived before Agamemnon. The persons who made the

brief resumes of the papers read in those years, which are to be found in our

annual volumes, but ill-supplied the place of the ' vates sacer.'

     The last meeting at which our Section assembled under its old title and in its old
conditions was that held at Glasgow in 1855, and our last president was Lord
Houghton, then Mr. Monckton Milnes.

     In 1856 at Cheltenham, a resolution was passed, I believe, on the initiative

of that highly gifted, all-accomplished and ever-helpful man, which changed the
name of Section F, and made it, what it has remained ever since, the Section of
Economic Science and Statistics.

    On that occasion too, our proceedings were for the first time opened by an

address, though that address, having been prepared before the resolution just
alluded to was passed, dealt exclusively with the subject of statistics. That it was

ably dealt with, you will conclude, when I say that the author of the address was
Lord Stanley, now Lord Derby, for even then, a quarter of a century ago, he had

begun to display on all public occasions that wide knowledge and painstaking
mastery of his subject, which have given him so great an influence amongst

educated men of all parties in England, and which it is safe to prophesy will,
when a sufficiently large selection of his addresses is rescued from the newspapers
and published, give him in some respects a greater name with posterity than almost
any statesman of our times. The main object of his address on this occasion was

to urge the advantage of establishing a Statistical Department of Government,
charged with the annual publication of such facts, relative to the management of

internal reform, as are reducible to numerical expression.

    In 1857 Archbishop Whately, who was by that time far advanced in years,
and no longer the Whately of the Oriel Common-room, did not follow the example

which Lord Stanley had set him, but opened our Section with a few remarks of a

leather obvious kind.

     Our venerable friend Sir Edward Baines, in 1858, was perhaps also too brief,

but he took skilful advantage of the revelations of Mr. Sidney Herbert's commission

on the health of our troops, then fresh in the memory of men, to enforce the utility
of statistics and to show that arithmetic 'which some thought so heartless, was
rising up as the most powerful advocate of the value of human life and health and
of all that can purify and elevate society.' He followed up his address, too, by an

important paper on the woollen manufactures of England in general and of Leeds,
where the meeting took place that year, in particular.

    1858 was, I may observe, rather exceptionally rich in good papers, which was
hardly the case with 1859, when we were gathered together at Aberdeen under
Colonel Sykes, then Member for that city.

     The address of Mr. Senior at Oxford, in 1860, was a protest against the
unscientific character of some of the papers read in our Section during the years
that had elapsed since 1856. He explained that he used the word unscientific not
dj'slogistically but only distinctively, the tendency he blamed being that to stray

Aacross the bounds of science into the realm of art. ' scieuce,' he said, ' aims

only at supplying materials for the memory and judgment. It does not pre-suppose
any purpose beyond the acquisition of knowledge. An art is intended to influence
the will : it pre-supposes some object to be attained, and it points out the easiest,
                                    '

the safest, or the most effectual conduct for that purpose.' He concluded by
advisinf that we should keep as much as possible within the strict limits of sta-

tistics and of economic science as understood by the School to which he belonged.

    In 1861 we met at Manchester, under the superintendence of Mr. Newraarch,

who premising that there was some danger of undue importance being attached to

what had been achieved in an age of physical discovery, vindicated the right of

economic science and statistical inquiry to a high place amongst the agencies
which have most contributed to the great advance which has lately been made by

civilized mankind.

It was a year of important papers ; one on the Progress of Manchester from

1840 to  1860, by Mr.  David  Chadwick    another  by Mr.  Molesworth  on the Pro-

                                        ;

gress of Co-operation in Rochdale ; and a third by Mr., now Sir Edward, Keed, on

the Statistics of the Iron-cased Ships of the British Navy, being amongst the most

interesting.

     The address of Mr. Edwin Chadwick to this Section in 1862 is not, I think,
printed in the annual volume, and Mr. Tite, who presided in 1863, made only a
very few observations ; but in both years some good papers were read, one by Mr.
Herman Merivale upon Colonization and another by Mr. Dunning Macleod upon
Political Economy, in 1862 ; and by Mr. Purdy, on the Decrease of the Agri-

cultural Population of England, in 1863.

     The address delivered at Bath by Dr. Farr, in 1864, was one of the best to
which, our Section has listened, and well worth recurring to. His object was to.
give a brief outline of the condition of statistical science at the time, and he suc-
ceeded admirably. It is indeed surprising how much matter of incontestable and
permanent value he contrived to pack into twelve pages, and this although he

sometimes diverged, perhaps, just a little into politics.
     In 1865 the present Lord Derby again presided over us, treating inter alia the

question how far our subjects ought to form part of the business of a strictly

scientific Association, and coming to the conclusion that our functions are rather

to suggest and stimulate than to originate thought. He further spoke at some
length and with many illustrations, of the use of the statistical method.

     In 1866 we met at Nottingham, under the guidance of Professor Thorold
Kogers, who discussed several of the questions that were prominent at the time,

such as the statistics of the live stock in England, a subject brought into promi-

nence by the cattle plague ; the state of the money market in that year of panic,
and the fears that were expressed as to to the exhaustion of our coal-supply. I
notice too, in his address, a phrase marked by his usual epigrammatic felicity and
which should be remembered. 'The economist,' he said, 'is constantly labouring
 to refute men's hasty sympathies by an appeal to their deliberate reason.'

      In 1867, at Dundee, I had myself the great honour of presiding over your

deliberations, and we had a good many interesting papers relating to the statistics

of the locality.

     In 1868 our Section was presided over by Mr. Samuel Brown, of the Society

of Actuaries, who devoted his address to a rapid survey of the various questions

most likely to interest students of our science which had come before the public
since the Dundee meeting, viz., to Technical Education, to the relations between
Labour and Capital, to the purchase of the Electric Telegraphs by the State, to
Weights and Measures, to Monetary Conferences, and to Insurance. Speaking
of the latter subject, with which he was exceptionally qualified to deal, he
observed : ' Vital statistics ajje now assuming a form which enables the most com-
plicated problems of human life to be dealt with as if they were certain and

simple events, yet little more than a century has elapsed since the Attorney- and
Solicitor-General of that day, when reporting on the application fbr a Eoyal

Charter to the first Society formed on scientific principles for the assurance of life,
objected to it on the ground that its success must depend on calculations taken on

tables of life and death, whereby the chance of mortality is attempted to be
reduced to a certain standard. " This is a mere speculation," they observe, " never

yet tried in practice, and consequently subject, like all other experiments, to

various chances in the execution."

     The petition was dismissed, but the Society (the Equitable) was formed, and
in spite of the gloomy prognostications at its birth had afterwards, at one time,

nearly 20,000,000A of assurances on lives in force together.

     The proceedings at Exeter, in 18G9, were opened by an address from Sir
Stafford Northcote, in which, in addition to making some yery curious comparisons
between the statistics of Devonshire and Lancashire, he illustrated the working

of the Law of Variation and the Law of Stability, pointed out the use of

imagination in giving life to the details which statisticians accumulate, charac-
terised the present as pre-eminently a statistical age, and spoke some words of

warning, not unneeded, against an indulgence in our national weakness for waste.

    At Liverpool, in 1870, we were presided over by Mr. Jevons, who amongst many.-
important observations made the following, which should be had in remembi-aace

if ever the relations of our Section to the other parts of the British Association

are again brought under review :

' I have always felt great gratification that the founders of this Association did!

not in any narrow spirit restrict its inquiries and discussions to the domain of

physical science. The existence of this section is a standing recognition of tha

truth that the condition of the people is governed by definite laws, however com-»

plicated and difficult of discovery they may be. It is no valid reproach against us

that we cannot measure and explain, and predict with the accuracy of a chemist

or an astronomer. Difficult as may be the problems presented to the experimental-

ist in his investigation of material nature, they are easy compared with the

problems of human nature, of which we must attempt the solution. I allow that

our knowledge of the causes in action is seldom sure and accurate, so as to present
the appearance of true science.

'There is no_ one who occupies a less enviable position than the political'

economist. Cultivating the frontier regions between certain knowledge and con-

jecture, his efforts and advice are scorned and rejected on all hands. If he arrives
at a sure law of human nature, and points out the evils which arise from its-

neglect, he is fallen upon by the large classes of people who think their own
common sense sufficient                                                                                             he is charged with being too abstract in his speculations

with overlooking the windings of the                                                                                    human  heart,     and   with     undervaluino-           the'

'However humane his motives, he is lucky if he escape being set down on

    This address may be said                                                                                        to mark an epoch, because in the course of it the

     In 1871, at Edinburgh,                                                                                         we met under the genial rule of Lord Neaves, and      it is

It is likewise noticeable that although, as we have seen, we were statisticians

first and economists only twenty-three years afterwards, Lord Neaves treats our
Section as mainly economic, and considers statistics as a mere accessary. This view,
however, was not taken by the members of the Section, who contributed that year
some very important statistical papers, amongst them one of peculiar interest in the
locality where it was read, on the scheme of the Merchant Company with reference
to the great Educational Hospitals of Edinburgh.

     At Bradford, in 1873, Mr. Forster did not deliver an address, but made a speech

characterised by his usual vigour, hopefulness, and knowledge of affairs.

     At Belfast, in 1874, the members of this Section had the good fortune to do
incidentally a great practical and immediate service, by bringing to an end a strike
which had caused great inconvenience, and they received the thanks of the local
authorities. The address to the Section was delivered by Lord O'Hagan, and an

interesting paper, read by Sir George Campbell, bore the (at first sight) rather

startling title ' On the Privileges over Land wrongly called Property.'
     Gur Belfast volume, that of 1874, contains the report of a Committee presided

over by Lord Houghton, which was appointed to inquire into the economic effects
of combinations of labourers and capitalists. That Committee called a conference,
which assembled at 22, Albemarle Street, where a deputation from the National
Federation of Associated Employers of Labour met a number of persons represent-
ing labour, and discussed a variety of questions of common interest.

     ' The discussion at the conference,' says the report, ' was carried on in the most

friendly spirit, and, in the opinion of your Committee, with manifest utility towards

the elucidation of the questions at issue. From the employers your Committee

have, moreover, received valuable written answers to their inquiries ; whilst the

"Beehive," the principal organ of the employed, said of the conference, "The case
was stated with great frankness, and the attack and defence was carried on in
perfect good humour for three hours ; and whether any conviction on either side

was altered or not, it was proved very distinctly that such meetings, if held more
frequently, could not fail to beget a clearer view of the questions in dispute on

both sides, and a stronger disposition than now exists to arrange differences in a

friendly and peaceable spirit."

     The address at Bristol in 1875, was delivered by Mr. Heywood, and contained
much information as well about the trade as the educational facilities of the neigh-
 bourhood, while various papers of merit were read, including one upon national
. education by Mrs. Grey ; one on the coal question by Mr. Jevons, find one on the
 value of European life in India by Dr. Mouatt.

     At Glasgow, in 1876, Sir George Campbell presided, and brought his great

 knowledge of India to bear upon various important problems.
      Amongst other things he made the following observations upon the use of

 narcotics and stimulants:

      'I have been led into the suggestion that these things are very much a matter
 of race by observation of the very singular way in which in Asia the population are
 divided into those who use opium and those who use alcohol, according to race
 lines, even in countries where the facilities of obtaining the one or the other are
 precisely similar. In the east of India I found that the consumption of opium in
-the various districts was just in proportion as a Turanian or Chinese element
 prevailed in the population. The Aryan races of India never take to opium in a
 very great degree, except in the case of the Sikhs, whose religion prohibits the use
 of tobacco. Even in the districts where the poppy is almost universally cultivated
 by the ryots (and they supply the opium which the Chinese consume), it is a
 happy fact that the native population does not take to the common use of opium

--and there are no greater symptoms of the ill effects of the drug than in districts

 where it is very rare and dear far less so than in districts where the cultivation
 is not permitted, but where there is an Indo-Chinese population. I cannot but
 think that such race proclivities open up an important field of inquiry.'

      Amongst papers that were read at Glasgow, a high place must be given to
 a most careful one by Professor Jack, ' On the Results of Five Years of Compulsory

  Education.'

      Lord Fortesoue, in his address at Plymouth, in 1877, dwelt much on the

population question, avowing himself nn opponent of the views of Malthus and

Mill, and claiming for his leaders Mr. Chadwick and Dr. Farr. He also spoke at

some length upon the imposition of what he considered needlessly high fares and
rates upon goods and passengers by railway, and recalled his own opposition
to the policy of Sir Robert Peel in not treating railways as monopolies, whose

powers should, for the sake of the public, be carefully restricted, and he further

advocated making the union, instead of the parish, the unit of English

administration under a County Representative Board.

     It is difficult in conducting the proceedings of this Section to hit the golden

mean between being too abstract and too popular. In the year 1875 the pendulum
swung perhaps a little too much to the popular direction, and subjects were

discussed which were thought by some hardly compatible with the scientific

character of the British Association. This led to a great deal of criticism, and

--in the year 1876 the question was raised and raised by a very eminent person

whether we of Section F should continue to hold our place. The attack was

able ; the defence was not particularly brilliant, but the goodness of our cause
or the leniency of our judges carried us through, and we were adjudged to have

successfully restated the reasons for our existence. It was well, perhaps, that the

question was raised, for out of this discussion came the elaborate and brilliant

--address the most elaborate and brilliant to which this Section has ever listened

which was delivered at Dublin by Professor Ingram, in 1878, on the position and

prospects of political economy.

Professor Ingram recapitulated the philosophical conclusions he had endeavoured

to enforce, as follows :

(1) That the study of the economic phenomena of society ought to be

systematically combined with that of the other aspects of social existence.

(2) That the excessive tendency to abstraction and to unreal simplifications
should be checked. (3) That the a priori deductive method should be changed
for the historical, (i) That economic laws, and the practical prescriptions

founded on those laws, should be conceived and expressed in a less absolute

form.  my'These are, in   opinion,' he says,  'the great reforms which  are  required

both in the conduct of economic research and in the exposition of its conclusions.'

He then proceeded to say that ' If the proper study of mankind is man, the work

of the Association, after the extrusion of our Section, would be like the play with

the part of the protagonist left out. What appears to be the reasonable suggestion

is, that the field of the Section should be enlarged, so as to comprehend the whole

of sociology. The economic facts of society, as I have endeavoured to show,
cannot he scientifically considered apart, and there is no reason why the researches
of Sir Henry Maine, or those of Mr. Spencer, should not be as much at home here
as those of Mr. Fawcett or Professor Price. Many of the subjects, too, at present
included in the artificial assemblage of heterogeneous inquiries known by the name

of Anthropology, really connect themselves with the laws of social development
and if our Section bore the title of the Sociological, the studies of Mr. Tylor and
Sir John Lubbock, concerning the early history of civilization, would find in it

their most appropriate place. I prefer the name Sociology to that of Social
Science, which has been rendered indefinite in common use, and has come to be

regarded as denoting a congeries of incoherent details respecting every practical

matter bearing directly or remotely on public interests which happen for the

moment to engage attention. There are other societies in which an opportunity-

is afforded for discussing such current questions in a comparatively popular arena.

But if we are to be associated here with the students of the other sciences, it is

our duty, as well as our interest, to aim at a genuinely scientific character in our
work. Our main object should be to assist in fixing theoretic ideas on the struc-

ture, functions, and development of society. Some may regard this view of the

subject with impatience, as proposing to us investigations not bearing on the
great and real needs of contemporary social life. But that would be a very
mistaken notion. Luciferous research, in the words of Bacon, must come before

fructiferous. 'Effectual practice,' says Mr. Spencer, 'depends on superiority of

ideas ; methods that answer are preceded by thoughts that are true.'

--758 REPORT 1881.

     In 1879 the address was delivered by Mr. Lefevre, and a most timely and use-
ful address it was, dwelling upon the relations between our agriculturists and those
of the United States with that clearness of thought, and, to use the famous Thucy-
didean phrase, painfulness in the search after truth, which one always expects in
the writings and speeches of that very distinguished man. The address of 1880,
by Mr. Hastings, has by some unfortunate accident not been printed in our annual
volume.

     With a view to giving you this brief sketch of the proceedings of our Section,

it has been necessary for me, of course, to look through those proceedings since
its foundation ; and I have been led to one or two conclusions which I should like
to lay before you.

     In the first place, I greatly doubt whether our system of publishing epitomes
of papers is a good one. These abstracts of abstracts are indeed most ghastly

reading. I think it would be worth while for those who organise the business of

the Section to consider next year whether it might not be better to print good

papers upon local statistics in full ; such will hardly in many cases have any other
means of being introduced to a wider public, whereas statistical papers of more
general interest may be safely left to the care of our first-born, the Statistical
Society. It would be enough to mention in our annual volume that they had been

read before us, without attempting an analysis which can hardly be satisfactory to
the author and must be dismal to the reader.

    In the second place I am inclined to think that we must adopt the policy

recommended by Professor Ingram, and widen our basis, taking care at the same
time to treat things scientifically, that is to say, as they are or were, and to avoid,
as much as possible, dealing with them as they ought to be. The Social Science
Association is better, I think, fitted than the "British Association for many even
good papers that have been read in this Section.

     Still more imperatively necessary is it absolutely to refuse a hearing to all who

wish to discuss burning questions of English politics, even although they have a

scientific side. However disagreeable it may be to individuals to have to take
elsewhere papers on which they may have bestowed much trouble, our first duty
as a Section is to continue to exist, and we shall assuredly not continue to exist if
we do not steel our hearts against their complaints.

      Another great reform would, I conceive, be accomjjlished if the authorities of the
Association were to encourage persons to read in this Section accounts of valuable
works on economical and statistical subjects appearing in foreign countries.

     It only remains for me to thank you for the patience with which you have

listened to an address which, although I think under the circumstances necessary,
 has contained little or nothing that is new. I must add that I accepted the
 honour of presiding over this Section some months ago, and before a very consider-

able change had come over my life. It has been a great pleasure to me to be able
to fulfil my engagement, but as I leave England next month and am necessarily
very much occupied, I am sure you will forgive me if I resign the presidency of

the Section into other and abler hands this afternoon.

      The following Papers and Eeport were read :

1. Notes on the Village System, and the Tenure of Land in the Dravidian
     Villages of the Bclchan. By Sir Walter Elliot, K.G.8.I., F.B.S.

     The increasing interest taken in Indian subjects is evidenced by the popularity
of recent publications relating to them. One of the latest of these is Sir* John
Phear's volume on the Aryan Village. It deals with those in the north and the

extreme south of Hindostan. Between these lie the Dravidian people, among whom

the callage system has been preserved in a still more perfect condition.

   A short sketch of the Dra-vddian municipality is then given, and the classes of

which it is composed, s'iz. :
     a. The village council, embracing the principal cultivating ryots.
          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                               759

     b. The village officers.
     c. The serfs or agfi-estial slaves.
     d. The local militia.
    e. The outside or foreign cultivators, who reside on sufferance.
     The di\-ision of the village lands into shares is then noticed.
     The incidence of the land-tax is described, as it has fluctuated under the oppressive
rule of native governments ; and a glance is then taken at the light throvra on the
general question of normal property in the soil, which has been so well treated by
Sir Henry Maine, Sir John Phear, and others.

3. On the Eelation of the Gold Standard in England to the International
                    Money Market. By Hyde Claeke, V.P.S.S.

     Eeferring to his paper before the Association in 1877 on Foreign Loans, Mr,
Olarke more particularly dealt with the operations of the London Money Market in
coimection with foreign loans and coupons. For what are called international
seciu-ities, cm-rent in all the money markets of Europe, the participation of the
London market is an essential featiu-e. This becomes supreme in periods of
political disquietude on the Continent, but it is partly dependent on the acceptance

of the English gold standard as a fixed and unalterable standard. Whatever may

be the theoretical toleration shown to bimetallism, the financial world has given ia

its adhesion to the gold standard. Any tampering with this is calcidated to

endanger our position as the central money market of the world, and to enable our

rivals at Paris and elsewhere to outstrip us. He pointed out some recent incidents

which were calculated to afiect us. The employment of coupons as an inter-
national cm'rency was also considered, and the connection of this market with the
growing American money market.

4. The Silver Question, and the DoiMe versus the Single Standard.
                              By "Wm. Westgakth.

     This country is monometallic with the gold standard, which means that in our

money engagements we are subject to all the mcidents that may affect the value of

gold. If gold happens at some time to be found very abundantly, as when Cali-

fornia and Australia poured forth then- treasiu-es thirty years ago, the value must

fall. On the other hand, if this great supply falls off, and if concurrently there is

--a disposition La some leading States to take preferably to a gold coinage both of
--these incidents having actually happened of late the value of gold must advance.

To earn, say a thousand pounds, under the first set of cii'cumstances may be a very

different thing from earning that quantity of gold under the second set. The latter

would be likely to cutaU a much greater labour or cost.

WeBut yet the terms of our money engagement are clear and fair.  engage to

pay or to be paid in gold, and we pay or receive accordingly, taking our chance

respectively of the appreciation or depreciation for the time of that metal. With

--the double standard, on the other hand, there are two metals to deal with gold

and silver; and if then- value, the one to the other, is exposed to fluctuation, they

cannot both be fairly used as legal money, seeing that the paying party woidd

assuredly elect to pay his creditor in that metal which for the time was relatively

cheaper.

The assertion of bimetallists is that the two metals can be maiutained substan-

tially at one fixed ratio of value, if there be a sufficiently extensive bimetallic

agreement for that piu-pose. The mints of the agi-eeing states have but to be kept

open to unlimited coinage at the fixed ratio, and that ratio must of necessity remain

substantially unchanged. In this way, the ratio of silver to gold remained
                           ----

760 BEPOET-- 1881.

substantially the same for many years, until the late large German currency opera-
tion caused the bimetallic mints to suspend their procedure, as the effect was to
deplete their currencies of gold, and substitute silver to an undesii-able extent. But
the Paris Monetary Conference was called together by the leading bimetallic States,

Trance and the United States, in the hope that by widening the bimetallic basis,

especially by the accession of England and Germany, the new union might be

strong enough to ' rehabilitate ' the silver, and maintain the ratio for the futiu'e
against all probable or possible incidents. The Conference has not succeeded in
this object, but as it has not dissolved, but only adjourned till April next j'ear,
there seems still a prospect of at any rate the rehabilitation of the silver. The
question has proved of great importance to this country from the remarkable
fact that, while this country and her colonies generally have a gold standard, India,

which in some sense may claim to be viewed as one half of our empire, has a

silver standard.

     The bimetallic view that the two metals can be kept to the one fixed ratio of
value depends on the free interaction of the two currencies. If both metals are full
legal money, any excess supply of the one metal will be absorbed as money of its

own kind, and room made for it by extrusion of so much of the other, out of coinage
into merchandise, until the said disturbing excess is balanced. In this way we

perceive that the ratio of value is kept steady at the expense of the ratio of
quantity. That is to say, if there should happen an unusual supply of gold, the
effect would be to increase the quantity of gold coinage in the world and to
diminish that of silver, and vice versa with excess silver supply, while the relative

value stood unchanged. But this would require that the two coinages should be in
a condition of free interaction ; and if they were so only to a very limited extent,
the changes in relative quantity might be inconveniently extreme, as indeed the

present limited bimetallic union has just of late practically experienced.

     The advantage of bimetallism is that the ratio of value can be kept steady by
an adequate breadth of union, and that with the larger basis of the two metals,

the incidents affecting the value of either metal separately are diminished in their

effect by being spread over the larger amount of the two metals.

   New South Wales, i??/ George BxoE^i.FowELL, M.A., F.R.A.S., F.S.8.

   -- --(a) Introductory. I wish to put on record, in detail, a unique case a test
--case the first that history has given us, of the actual recorded results of high

and low tariffs in two similarly circumstanced communities, specially interesting
                                                                  --

because they are young communities, where, if anywhere. Protection is allowed

theoretically.

    Victoria and New South Wales are two of our colonies, starting ten years ago

with practically similar economic environments and opportunities. Victoria has

during that decade pursued a policy of Protection, and New South Wales one of
Pree Trade. The results are now matter of record.

   --(b) The Details. These I shall briefly sum up under three heads :

     1. The development of maimfactures, as opposed to the production of ' Colonial
produce ' (of food and raw material), has been, on the whole, about equal, if we look
to employment of population and capital. If Protection has introduced some

manufactures. Free Trade has introduced others.

    2. In regard to the provision of revenue (the main argument), New South
Wales provides a far larger general revenue per head of population. And the

special revenue from customs duties has increased with the low tarifl', but has barely
maintained its level under the high tariff. The low tariff provides an equal amount

of revenue to the high tariff, though the population is smaller.

     3. In regard to //enerrt^ prosperity (industrial prosperity, social prosperity, the

gro^^'^h of trade, of the carrying trade, of the general wealth, and, above all, of

population), New South Wales has advanced with far greater rapidity thaa

--Victoria.
     (e) General Results. 1. In Victoria itself this record of what has actually
taken place will greatly increase the reactionary movement in favour of a lower

tariff. Signs of this are already apparent.

    2. In the British Empire generally these recorded results may stimulate local

Parliaments to maintain low tariff's, to the undoubted material benefit of every

industrial worker throughout the Empu-e.

   A --{d) Hecommendation. I would supplement my remarks with a statement of

mythe difficulties I encomitered in  researches from the different methods somc:-

times adopted in the otherwise most excellent statistical records of these two Colonies.

Uniformity in the method of registering statistical facts is of the utmost import-

ance to comparative investigations. It would be of the highest advantage to secure

for the future such uniformity, at all events, within the limits of the British

Empire.

              3. On the Remedies proposed for Disputes ahout Wages.
                        By the Rev. W. H. Jemison, LL.B.

     The paper reviewed various remedies for wages disputes, including arbitration,
boards of conciliation, co-operation, and industrial partnership, the last-named of
which the writer described as the most hopeful, being very favourable to pro-
duction, and calculated to exercise a good influence on the workpeople, though
there might be difficulty in ascertaining the fixed wage and in the working of an
efficient check for measuring the claim of each workman to additional pay. The
plan might be helped by the adoption of a sliding scale, and, when need arises, by

reference to arbitration.

1. On the Free Public Libraries of Manchester and Netting Hill, London.
                            By James Hetwood, F.B.S.

     According to the Report of 1879-80, presented to the Citj^ Council, there are

64,079 volumes in the Eeference Library situated in the Old Town Hall, Man-

chester, as well as a large number of newspapers, serials, periodicals, and trans-

actions in progress.

     The Reference Library is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. ; and on Simday from
2 p.m. to 9 p.m.

     During the year 1879-80 the number of readers were

On week-days                                         126,381

                                                     134,420

or on an average,

                   406 readers on a week-day.
                   152 readers on a Sunday.

During the same year the number of books issued was

                           175,304 on week-days.
                             11,144 on Sundays.

                   560 books issued on each week-day, and
                   210 on each Sunday.

    Books may be perused in the Reference Library, but are not permitted to be
taken away from that collection.

     There are five Lending Libraries in different parts of Manchester, to each of

which a news-room is attached, and books may be perused on the premises.
    Borrowers may obtain books, after signing a written agreement according to

the Library regulations, in the Lending Libraries.

    The books are classified under ditterent heads : thus in the Hulme Lending

Library there are 15,281 volumes, of which

                    754 relate to Theology and Philosophy.
                   4555 History, Biography.

                    399 Politics and Commerce.

                   3398 Works of Fiction.

                   15,341

     Diu'ing the year there were 153,250 volumes lent out, and 42,236 volumes

perused in the reading-room.

    On Sundays there were 6,868 volumes perused, and 6,836 readers came to the

Libraiy.

    During two weeks, in September 1880, there were 8,032 persons who came to

the Hulme News-room, of whom there came on

      Eeading-rooms for boys have been established at the Chorlton and Ancoats

branches. In Hidme the cellar has been converted into a reading-room for boys,
in which upwards of 250 boys can be accommodated at one time. The room is
light, pleasant, and comfortable, and has been attended by as many juvenile readers

as can be conveniently admitted.

      In the Lending Libraries there were, in September 1880, 31,138 borrowers'
cards in force, being an increase of 321 over the previous year.

      Parcels of periodicals and papers, which have been out on the news-room tables,
are made up weekly, as well as volumes not wanted, and are sent to various chari-
table institutions, such as the Infirmary and the Hospital for Inciu-ables, and are also
sent to the guardians of the Manchester and Chorlton Unions, for the use of the
inmates of the Workhouse Hospitals, and are thankfully accepted.

     Out of more than half a million of books, which have been lent out for reading,
only 74 have been lost. Of these, 44 were replaced or paid for by the borrowers
themselves, and 10 by guarantors.

     There have been in the yeai-, 1,091,000 visits to the Eeadmg-rooms for the
perusal of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. There have been 966,468 books
read in the year, or an average of 2,777 on each day.

     The ratepayers in Manchester are contented that the money for their Free

Libraries is wisely laid out.
     In Netting Hill, London, a Free Library, belonging to Mr. J. Ileywood, F.E.S.,

has been established for seven years, and contains 5,000 volumes. Of this number,
in the year 1881, between January and July, there were 6,482 volumes lent out to
read. During the same half-year there were in the Library

March had  10,404 readers on week-days, and
               834 readers on Sunday afternoons.

            2,119 readers on week-days, and
               155 readers on Simday afternoons

and during the month of March there were

                                   1,178 volumes lent out to read.

   A borrower of books pays one penny to this Library, and either deposits half-

a-crown, or gives a certificate, signed by two ratepayers, guaranteeing the safety

of the volimie.

            2. On the Progress of British Ccmimerce in a Generation.
                                  By E. J. Watheeston.

     The author maintained that a great mistake was commonly made by writers on
' commercial depression ' by examining years when they should look to decades,
and decades when they should take generations into account. Taking thirty-two
years, being about a ' generation,' the total value of our exports of home produce,
in 1848, was 52,849,445^., being ia the proportion of 11. 18s. per head of popula-
tion. In 1880 the figiures were 223,060,446^., or 6/. 9s. 5d. per head. This shows

that the expansion of our foreign trade in the coui-se of thu'ty-two years has been
enormous. Except, perhaps, the commerce of the United States, it stands unparal-
leled in the history of any nation. Taking the amounts, the colonial exports aug-

mented by about 61^ millions, while the foreign exports increased by more than
108^ millions. The total value of imports into the United Kingdom in 1854 was
152,389,053/., or in proportion of 6;. 10s. 2d. per head of population. In 1880
--764
                       KEPOET 1881.

the value had increased to 411,229,565/., or 11/. 18s. 7d. per head. It is unde-

niable that our imports have increased at a far greater ratio than our exports of

home produce. While the increase of our imports was 110 per cent., or at the

rate of 6|- per cent, per annum, that of our exports was only 66 per cent., or little

more than 3| per cent, per annum. The fact of this large increase of imports, and
the great preponderance of the latter over exports, appears to he the chief ground

of alarm of those who lament the ' decline ' of our commerce. In 1854 the imports

of meat and provisions were 5,782,164Z., and of corn and flour 21,760,283/. ; total,

27,542,447/. In 1880 the imports of meat and provisions were 32,175,326/., of

corn and flour 62,857,269/. ; total, 95,032,595/. There could be no question what-

ever that the vast increase vrithin the last twenty years in our imports has been
-- Weentirely for the benefit of ' the consumer' that is, the nation at large.
                                                                                                                      bought

increasing quantities of food from foreign countries solely because the articles we

ceived over five times more meat and provisions, and over three times more coi-n

and flour, from foreign countries in the year 1880 than in 1854. Expressed per

head of population, our total food-imports averaged 18.s. 9f/. per head in 1854,

while in 1880 the average per head was 3/. 17s. 3f/. In other words, food has

coran from abroad to an increased amount represented by 2/. 18s. Qd. for every

man, woman, and chUd.

The aggregate value of exports and imports (exhibiting the real progress of the

nation)  in 1854 was 268,210,145/., or 9/.  lis.  per  head of  population                                            and in  1880

697,644,031/., or 20/. 4s. lOd. per head. In its gross amount the increase was

152 per cent., showing that there is no ground for speaking of a ' decline' in our

commerce. The total commerce of this country is with over 100 foreign States

and colonial possessions, more than one-half of which is carried on with six coun-

tries : first, the United States ; secondly, France ; thirdly, British India ; fourthly,

--Germany ; fifthly, Australasia ; and sixthly, Russia. Virtually, we have but two

great articles of export namely, textile fabrics and iron, which comprise over

three-fifths of our total home exports, the rest being composed of many small

items. In 1868 the exports of cotton fabrics were 67,686,772/., woollen 25,784,562/.,

linen 9,548,412/., andiron and steel 17,6.34,395/., or 120,654,141/. out of a total of

179,677,812/. In 1880 the exports of cotton, woollen, and linen fabrics and iron
and steel were 131,611,850/., out of a total of 223,060,446/. The question that

suggests itself in regard to this overwhelming preponderance of certain classes of

our exports is, whether the causes of it be natural or artificial. It is true, our

abundance of coal and of iron ore, and the perfection to which we have brought
machinery, justify to some extent our profiting by these advantages. But have we

not gone too far in this direction ? Being the first to invent the wonderful steam

maehinery for working cotton fibre, flax, and wool into woven fabrics, and possess-

ing an abundance of motive-power, we used these advantages for a considerable

period with great success. But the time came when other nations competed with

us in the same field, and we must not wonder if this industrial rivalry be getting

more and more severe. The one remedy, and perhaps the one only, clearly oflering

itself, is to enlarge the field of our industrial activity. The thirteen millions' worth

of silk goods we imported in 1880 came chiefly from France, which has no advan-

tages whatever over us for manufacturing them, but the one of higher technical

education of its workers, productive of greater taste. This is a matter which it is

entirely in our own hands to remedy. Perhaps there are a few other things besides

silk manufactures which we might with advantage produce ourselves, instead

of importing them. For example, we pm-chase amiually, chiefly from France,

about 19^ million pounds' worth of butter, cheese, and eggs. At least the twelve
millions' worth of Dutter and the five millions' worth of cheese we buy abroad we

might produce oiu-selves, seeing how many tens of thousands of acres of land in

this country are lying waste, though admirably adapted for pastures. That our

farmers should allow us to import 623 millions of eggs annually is quite unex-
We --plained.
         must, in order to continue progressing, do two things namely,

extend the great markets of our international trade into new regions ; and extend
the narrow limits of our leading manufacturing industries into wider fields. With

                                                                                                                                    I

these aims steadfastly kept in view, there is no reason why, in less than another
twenty years, the sum-total of our commerce should not reach the figiu'e of a round
thousand millions.

3. Some Besults of the Removal of the Malt Tax} Bij H. Stoper.

The author commenced by a sketch of tlie history of the Malt Tax, pointing out

its origin and recounting the arguments for its repeal urged by deputations in the

Central Chamber of Commerce upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1870 and

1874. He pointed out, in opposition to these, that farmers wiU find the repeal of

the Malt Tax act more and more against their interest, because barley is no longer

subject to a monopoly. The former mode of collecting the tax practically shut out

the foreign barleys from the mash-tuns of the vast majority of brewers. Few but

the largest brewers cared for the expensive best barleys of Germany and France.

All were compelled by law to use malt or sugar, as the natural laws of fermenta-

tion made it impossible to most brewers to use only a certain percentage of sugar,

Ausually a small one, and the rest malt. Now, all this is changed.  brewer can

brew in a better way in every sense by using a proportion of other grain than malted

barley. Now, too, it is very probable that large quantities of malt made abroad will

be imported into this country. The result of aU these causes combined must effect a

heavy loss to British landowners and farmers. Maltsters as a body will in some ways

lose as much as farmers. Formerly a maltster derived a good portion of his j)rofi.ts

from skilful manipulation of the duty. This is now entirely lost to him. The com-

petition of raw grain may prove more fatal to his interests than to the classes already

xaentioned. The author pointed out that the loss would only fall on those maltsters

who worked unscientifically, for the others would gain by the freedom to apply the

best processes in the operation. Malt will, and must, be vastly improved in manu-

facture and value. The malting process will get to be recognised as the most impor-

tant of the first steps in the production of sound, pure beer. To brewers the change

is of less importance than it would appear at first sight. The actual charge upon

each quarter of malt now used by the very great majority of brewers exceeds the

Nowformer charge. Then a quarter paid 22s. 8d., inclusive of brewers' licence.

each quarter is assumed to yield 82 lbs. gravity, and has to pay 25s., less 6 per

cent. ; but as in most breweries, and all good ones, the yield of the malt is more

than 6 per cent, greater than 82 lbs., it is fairly within bounds to assume that

each quarter of malt now yields to the revenue 25s., an increased charge of 2s. 4:d.

This money is, of course, paid by the general public. The increase does not add

the large amount to the national revenue that it should do, as every quarter used

by private brewers paying the 6s. licence only, in excess of the first quarter used,

Apays no duty.  large amount of beer now brewed entirely escapes duty. The

power to use other materials than malt is a boon to brewers, and a national gain,

notwithstanding that farmers and maltsters lose. The public get better beer,

brewers make larger profits, rice merchants and maize miUers are having a good

time ; but farmers, in obtaining what they so long desired, find that they now

come into direct competition with the foreign producer in a field which the old

law helped to hedge round for their especial benefit. Past experience of similar

contests leaves very little room for speculation as to the result.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.

     The Pbesident delivered the following Address :

The astonishing progress which has heen made in the construction and applica-

tion of machinery during the half-century which has elapsed since the nativity of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science, is a theme which I might
with much complacency adopt in this address ; hut instead of reviewing the past
and exulting in our successes, it will he more profitahle to look to the future, and
to dwell on our failures. It is but justice to say that by growing experience, by
increased facilities of manufactiu-e, and by the exercise of much skill and ingenuity,

we have succeeded in multiplying and expanding the applications of ovu- chief

motor, the Steam Engine, to an extent that would have appeared incredible fifty
years ago, but the gratulation inspired by this success is clouded by the reflection
that the steam engine even in its best form remains to this day a most wasteful
apparatus for converting the energy of heat into motive power. Our predecessors

of that period had not the advantage of the knowledge which we possess of the

true nature of heat, and the conditions and limits affecting its utilization. In their
time heat was almost universally regarded as a fluid which, under the name of
caloric, was supposed to lie dormant in the interstices of matter until forced out
by chemical or mechanical means. Although Bacon, Newton, Cavendish, and

Boyle all maintained that heat was only internal motion, and although Davy and
Eumford not only held that view but proved its accuracy by experiment, yet the
old notion of caloric continued to hold its ground, until in more recent times,
Joule, Meyer, Codling, and others put an end to all doubt on the subject, and
established the all-important fact that heat is a mode of motion having, like any

other kind of motion, its exact equivalent in terms of work. By their reasonings

and experiments it has been definitely proved that the quantity of heat which
raises the temperature of a pound of water 1° Fahrenheit, has a mechanical value
equal to lifting 772 lbs. one foot high, and that conversely the descent of that
weight from that height is capable of exactly reproducing the heat expended.

     The mechanical theory of heat is now universally accepted, although a remnant

of the old doctrine is displayed in the continued use of the misleading term 'latent

heat.' According to the new theory, heat is an internal motion of molecules
capable of being communicated from the molecules of one body to those of another,

the result of the imparted motion being either an increase of temperature, or the

performance of work. The work may be either external, as where heat, in expand-
ing a gas, pushes away a resisting body, or it may be internal, as where heat pidls
asunder the cohering particles of ice in the process of liquefaction, or it may Ije

partly internal and partly external, as it is in the steam engine, where the 'first
efi'ect of the heat is to separate the particles of water into vapour, and the second

to give motion to the piston. Internal as well as external work may be reconverted
into heat, but until the reconversion takes place the heat which did the work does

not exist as Heat, and it is delusive to call it 'latent heat.' All heat problems are

comprised under the three leading ideas of internal work, external work, and tem-

perature, and no phraseology should be used that conflicts with those ideas.

    The modern theory of heat has thrown new light upon the theory of the steam

Weeno-ine.  now know what is the mechanical value in foot-pounds of the beat
Volved in the combustion of 1 lb. of coal. In practice we can determine how
much of that heat is transmitted to the water in the boiler, and we are taught how
to calculate the quantity which in the process of vaporization takes the form of
Weinternal work.      can determine how much disappears in the engme in the shape

of external work, including friction, and the remainder, with the exception of the
trifling quantity saved in the feed water, we know to be lost. Taking a good con-
densing engine as an example, we may roughly say that, dividing the whole heat
energy into ten equal parts, two escape by the chimney, one is lost by radiation
and friction, six remain unused when the steam is discharged, and one only is
realised in useful work. It may be fully admitted that the greater part of the

aggreo-ate loss is inevitable, but are we to suppose that the resources of science,

ingenuity, and skill have been exhausted in the attamment of.so miserable a result ?

Nothincr but radical changes can be expected to produce any great mitigation of
the present monstrous waste, and without presuming to say what measures are
mpracticable and what are not, I will briefly point out the directions                         which

amelioration is theoretically possible, and shaU afterwards advert to the question
whether we may hope to evade the difficulties of the steam engine by resorting

to electrical methods of obtaining power.  place  in  the                     ..     a  ,heat  to the

boiler why is it that we have to throw away, at the very outset of our operations,
twice as much heat as we succeed in utilising in the engine ? The answer is that
min order to force a transmission of heat from the fire to the water                    the boiler, a

certain excess of temperatm-e over that of the water must exist in the fui-nace and
flues and the whole of the heat below the required excess must pass away unused,
except the trifling portion of it which disappears in the production of draught.

Further, that since we cannot avoid admitting tlie nitrogen of the air along with
the oxyi-en, we have to heat a large volume of neutral gas which has no other

mtubes as flues, it is vain to expect any great result from further perseverance that
direction and unless a method can be devised of burnuig the fuel inside instead of
outside the apparatus, so as to use the heated gases conjointly with the steam as a
Weworkino- medium in the engine, a remedy appears to be hopeless.                              already

.practise" internal combustion in the gas engine, and it is clear that with gaseous
ftiel at all events, we could associate such a mode of combustion with the vaporisa-
Wetion of water.      may even regard a gun as an engine with internally burnt

fuel and here I may remark that the action of heat in a gun is strictly analogous
                                                      the heat is evolved from chemical
,to that of heat in   a steam engine. In both cases   only in degree. The gun is the
combination, and      the resulting pressures differ

equivalent of the cylinder, and the shot of the piston, and the diagrams represent-
ing the pressure exerted in the two cases bear a close resemblance to each other,
mile the powder is burning in the gun we have a nearly uniform pressure, just
as we have in the cylinder while the steam is entering, and in both cases the

uniform pressure is followed by a diminishing pressure, represented by the usual

curve of expansion. If in the steam engine we allowed the piston to be blown
out it would act as a projectUe, and if in the gun we opposed          mechanical resist-
ance to the shot, we might utilize the effect in a quieter form        of motive power

But it is a remarkable fact that such  is the   richness of coal as a  store of mechanical
energy, that a pound of coal, even as  used    in the steam engine,    produces a dynamic

effect about five  times greater than a pound of gunpowder     burnt in a gun. 1 can-
not, however, on   this account encourage the idea that steam
                                                               may be advantageously

substituted for gunpowder in the practice of gunnery.

ture and pressure of the steam }>egin to run down, and if we could continue to
mexpand indefinitely, the entire heat would be exhausted, and the energy previously

expended separating the water into steam would be wliolly given up in external

effect                    but  this exhaustion would not be complete  until the absolute  zero  of tem-
                       ;

perature was reached (viz., 461° below the zero of Fahrenheit). I do not mean
to say that an ideally perfect engine necessarily involves unlimited expansion,

seeing that if instead of discharging the steam at the end of a given expansion, we
made the engine itself do work in compressing it, we might under the conditions

of Carnot's reversible cycle, so justly celebrated as the foundation of the theory

of the steam engine, recommence the action with all the unutilised heat in an
available form. But an engine upon this principle could only give an amount of

useful effect corresponding to the difference between the whole work done by the
engine, and that very large portion of it expended in the operation of compres-
sion, and this difference viewed in relation to the necessary size of the engine,
woidd be quite insignificant, and would in fact be wholly swallowed up in friction.

Carnot did not intend to suggest a real engine, and his hypothesis therefore takes
no cognizance of losses incident to the application of an actual fire to an actual
boiler. His ideal engine is also supposed to be frictionless, and impervious to heat

except at the point where heat has to be transmitted to the water, and there the

condition of perfect conduction is assumed. In short an engine which would even
approximately conform to the conditions of Carnot's cycle is an impossibility, and
a perfect steam engine is alike phantom whether it be sought for in the cyclical

process of Carnot, or under the condition of indefinite expansion. Practically we
mhave to deal with a machine which, like all other machines, is subject to friction,

and expanding the steam we quickly arrive at a point at which the reduced
pressure on the piston is so little in excess of the friction of the machine, as to
render the steam not worth retaining, and at this point we reject it. In figurative
Welanguage we take the cream off the bowl and throw away tlie milk.
                                                                                                do save
a little by heating the feed water, but this gain is very small in comparison with

the whole loss. What happens in the condenser is that all the remaining energy
which has taken the form of internal work is reconverted into heat, but it is heat
of 80 low a grade that we cannot apply it to the vaporization of water. But
although the heat is too low to vaporize water it ia not too low to vaporize ether.

If instead of condensing by the external application of water, we did so by the

similar application of ether, as proposed and practised by M. du Trembley twenty-five

years ago, the ether would be vaporized, and we should be able to start airesh with
high tension vapour, which in its turn would be expanded until the frictional limit

was again reached. At that point the ether would have to be condensed by the
outward
agam in                   application  of cold water and pumped back, in the liquid state, to  act over
                           a similar   manner. This method of working was extensively          tried in

France when introduced by M. du Trembley and the results were sufficiently en-
couraging to justify a resumption of the trials at the present time, when they could
be made under much more favourable conditions. There was no question as to the
economy effected, but in the discussions which took place on the subject, it was
contended that equally good results might be attained bv improved applications of
the steam, without resorting to an additional medium. " The compound engine of
the present da,y does in fact equal the efficiency of Du Trembley's combined steam
and ether engine, but there is no reason why the ether apparatus should not confer
the same advantage on the modern engine that attended its application to the older
form. The objections to its use are purely of a practical natiu-e and might very
possibly yield to persevering efforts at removal.

     I need scarcely notice the advantage to be derived from increasing the initial
pressure of the steam so as to widen the range of expansion by raising the upper
limit of temperature instead of reducing the lower one. It must be remembered,
however, that an increase of temperature is attended with the serious drawback of
increasing the quantity of heat carried off by the gases from the fire, and also tlie

loss by radiation, so that we have not so much to gain by increase of pressure as ia
commonly imagined.

But even supposing the steam engine to be improved to the utmost extent that

practical considerations give us reason to hope for, we sliould still have to adjudge
it a wasteful though a valuable servant. Nor does there appear to be any prospect

of substituting with advantage any other form of thermo-dynamic engine, and

thus we are led to enquire wliether any other kind of energy is likely to serve us

better than heat, for motive power.

     Most people, especially those who are least competent to judge, look to elec-

tricity as the coming panacea for all mechanical deficiency, and certainly the
astonishing progress of electricity as applied to telegi-aphy, and to those marvellous
instruments of recent invention which the British Post Office claims to include in
its monopoly of the electric telegraph, as well as the wonderful advance which
electricity has made as an illuminating agent, does tend to impress us with faith in
its future gi'eatness in the realm of motive power as well.

     The difference between heat and electricity in their modes of mechanical action
is verj^ wide. Heat acts by expansion of volume which we know to be a neces-
sarily wastefal principle, while electricity operates by attraction and repulsion,
and thus produces motion in a manner wliich is subject to no greater loss of effect
than attends the motive action of gravity as exemplified in the ponderable applica-
tion of falling water in liydraulic machines. If then we could produce electricity
with the same facility and economy as heat, the gain would be enormous, Ijut this,
as yet at least, we cannot do. At present by far the cheapest method of generating
electricity is by the dynamic process. Instead of beginning with electricity to
produce power, we begin with power to produce electricity. As a secondary motor,
an electric engine may, and assuredly will, play an important part in future appli-
cations of power, but our present enquiry relates to a primary, and not a secondary,
employment of electricity. Thus we are brought to the question, from what
source, other than mechanical action, can we hope to obtain a supply of electricity
sufficiently cheap and abundant to enable it to take the place of heat as a motive
energy. It is commonly said that we know so little of the nature of electricity
that it is impossible to set bounds to the means of obtaining it, but ignorance is at

least as liable to mislead in the direction of exaggerated expectation as in that of

incredulity. It may be freely admitted that the nature of electricity is much less
understood than that of heat, but we know that the two are very nearly allied.
The doctrine that heat consists of internal motion of molecules may be accepted

with almost absolute certainty of its truth. The old idea of heat being a separate
entity is no longer held except by those who prefer the fallacious evidence of their
senses to the demonstrations of science. So also the idea of electricity having a
separate existence from tangible matter must be discarded, and we are justified in
 concluding that it is merely a strained or tensional condition of the molecules of
matter. Although electricity is more prone to pass into heat, than heat into
electricitv, yet we know that they are mutually convertible. In short I need
scarcely remind you tliat according to that magnificent generalisation of modern
times, so pregnant with great consequences, and for which we are indeljted to
many illustrious investigators, we now know that heat, electricity, and mechanical
 action are aU equivalent and transposable forms of energy, of which motion is

 the essence.

     To take a cursor}' view of our available sources of energy, we have, firstly, the
direct heating power of the sun's rays, which as yet we have not succeeded in
 applying to motive purposes. Secondly we have water power, wind power, and
tidal power, all depending upon influences lying outside of our planet. And thirdly
 we have chemical attraction or affinity. Beyond these there is nothing worth naming.
 Of the radiant heat of the sun I shall have to speak hereafter, and bearing in
 mind that we are in search of electricity as a cause, and not an effect, of motive
power, we may pass over the dj-namical agencies comprised under the second head,

 and direct our attention to chemical affinity as the sole remaining source of energy

 available for our purpose. At present we derive motive power from chemical
attraction through the medium of heat only, and the question is, can we with
 advantage draw upon the same source through the medium of electricity. The
process by which we obtain our supply of heat from the exercise of affinity is that
of combustion, in which the substances used consist, on the one hand, of those we

                                                                                     1

call fuel, of which coal is the most important, and, on the other, of oxygen, which

we derive from the atmosphere. The oxygen has an immense advantage over every

other available suhstance in being omnipresent and costless. The only money value
involved is that of the fuel, and in using coal we employ the cheapest oxidizable

substance to be found in nature. Moreover the weight of coal used in the

combination is only about one-third of the weight of oxygen, so that we only

pay upon one-fourth of the whole material consumed. Thus we have conditions

of the most favourable description for the production of energy, in the form of

heat, and if we could only use the affinities of the same substances with equal

facility to evolve electric energy instead of heat energy, there would be nothing

more to desire; but as yet there is no appearance of our being able to do this.
According to our present practice we consume zinc, instead of coal, in the voltaic

production of electricity, and not only is zinc 30 or 40 times dearer than coal but

it requires to be used in about sixfold larger quantity in order to develop an
equal amount of energy. Some people are bold enough to say that with our

present imperfect knowledge of electricity we have no right" to condemn all

plentiful substances, other than coal, as impractical substitutes for metallic

zinc, but it is manifest that we cannot get energy fi-om affinity, where affinity

has already been satisfied. The numerous bodies wliich constitute tlie mass of
our glolje, and which we call earths, are bodies in this inert condition. They

have already, by the union of the two elements composing them, evolved the

f"nergy due to combination, and that energv' has ages ago been dissipated in space

in the form of heat, never again to be available to us. As well might we try to
make fire witli ashes as to use such bodies over again as sources of either lieat or
electricity. To make them fit for our pui-pose we should first have to annul tlieir

state of combination, and this would require the expenditure of more energy upon
them than we could derive from their recombination. Water, being oxidized
hj-drogen, must be placed in the same category as the earths. In short, tlie onlv

abundant substances in nature possessing strong unsatisfied affinities are those of

organic origin, and in the absence of coal, which is the accumulated product of a

past vegetation, our supply of sucli substances would be insignificant. This beiu"-
the case, until a means be found of making the combination of coal with oxvgen

directly available for the development of electric energy, as it now is of heat

energy, there seems to be no probability of our obtaining electricity from chemical

action at such a cost as to supplant heat as a motive agent.

But while still looking to heat as tlie fountain-head of our power, we mav very

possibly learn to transmute it, economically, into the more available form of

electricity. One method of transformation we already possess, and we have every
Wereason to believe there are otliers yet to be discovered.
                                                              know that when

dissimilar metals are joined at opposite ends, and heated at one set of junctions
while tliey are cooled at the otlier, part of the heat applied disappears in the

process, and assumes the form of an electric current. Each couple of metals may

be treated as the cell of a voltaic battery, and we may multiply them to any

extent, and group them in series or in parallels, with the same results as are

obtained by similar combinations of voltaic cells. The electricity so produced we

term Thermo-electricity, and the apparatus by which the current is evolved is the
thermo-electric battery. At present this apparatus is even more wasteful of heat

tlian the steam engine, but considering the very recent origin of this branch of

electrical science, and our extremely imperfect knowledge of the actions involved,

we may reasonably regard tlie present thermo-electi-ic batterv as the infant

condition of a discovery, which, if it follow the rule of all previous discoveries

Nowin electricity, only requires time to develop into great practical importance.

if we possessed an efficient apparatus of this description we could at once apply

it to the steam engine for the pui-pose of converting into electric energy the heat

which now escapes with the rejected steam, and the gases from the fire. The vice

of the steam engine lies in its "inability to utilize heat of comparatively low grade

"but if we could use up tlie leavings of the .steam engine by a supplemental machine

Weacting on thermo-electric principles, the present excessive waste would he avoided.

     may even anticipate that in the distant future a thermo-electric engine may

not oEly he used as an auxiliary, but in complete substitution of the steam engine.

Such an expectation certainly seems to be countenanced by what we may observe

in animated nature. An animal is a living machine dependent upon food both for

its formation and its action. That portion of the food which is not used for

growth or structural repair, acts strictly as fuel in the production of heat. Part

of that heat goes to the maintenance of the animal temperature, and the remainder

gives rise to mechanical action. The only analogy between the steam engine and

this lining engine is that both are dependent upon the combustion of fuel, the

combustion in the one case being extremely slow, and in the other very rapid.

In the steam engine the motion is produced by pressure, but in the animal machine

it is effected by muscular contraction. The energy which causes that contraction^

if not piu'ely electrical, is so much of that natiu'e that we can produce the same

effect by electricity. The conductive system of the nerves is also in harmony wath

our conception of an electrical arrangement. In fact, a description of the animal

machine so closely coincides with that of an electro-dynamic machine actuated by

thermo-electricity, that we may conceive them to be substantially the same thing.

At all e^'ents, the animal process begms with combustion and ends with electrical

action, or something so nearly allied to it as to differ only in Icind. And now

observe how superior the result is in natm-e's engine to what it is in om-s. Nature

Weonly uses heat of low grrade, such as we find whoUy unavailable.  reject our

steam, as useless, at a temperature that would cook the animal substance, while

nature works with a heat so mild as not to hurt the most delicate tissue. And

yet, notwithstanding the gi'eater availability of high grade temperature, the

quantity of work performed by the living engine, relatively to the fuel consumed,,

Howputs the steam engine to shame.    all this is done in the animal organization

we do not yet understand, but the result points to the attainability of an efficient

means of converting low grade heat into electricity, and in striving after a method

of accomplishing that object we shall do well to study nature, and profit by the

excellence which is there displayed.

But it is not alone in connection with a better utilization of the heat of

combustion that tliermo-electricity bears so important an aspect, for it is only

the want of an efficient apparatus for converting heat into electricity that prevents

our using the direct heating action of the sun's rays for motive power. In our

climate, it is true, we shall never be able to depend upon sunshine for power,,

nor need we repine on that account so long as we have the preserved sunbeams-

wliich we possess in the condensed and portable form of coal, but in regions more

favoured with sun and less provided with coal the case would be different. The

actual power of the sun's rays is enormous, being computed to be equal to melting

a crust of ice 103 feet thick over the whole earth in a year. Within the tropics

it would be a great deal more, but a large deduction would everywhere have to be-

made for absorption of heat by the atmosphere. Taking all things into account,

however, we shall not be far from the truth in assuming the solar heat, in that

part of the world, to be capable of melting annually, at the surface of the ground,

Nowa layer of ice 85 feet thick.  let us see what this means in mechanical effect.

To melt 1 lb. of ice requires 142-4 English units of heat, which, multiplied by 772,

gives us 109,932 foot-pounds as the mechanical equivalent of the heat consumed

in melting a pound of ice. Hence we find that the solar heat operating upon an

area of one acre, in the tropics, and competent to melt a layer of ice 85 feet thick

in a year, would, if fully utilized, exert the amazing power of 4,000 horses acting

for nearly 9 hoiu-s every day. In dealing with the sun's energy we could afford to

be wasteful. Waste of coal means waste of money, and premature exhaustion

of coal-beds. But the sun's heat is poured upon the earth in endless profusion

endless at all events in a practical sense, for whatever anxiety we may feel as to

Wethe duration of coal, we need have none as to the duration of the sun.  have

therefore only to consider whether we can divert to oiu- use so much of the sun's

motive energy as will repay the cost of the necessary apparatus, and whenever

such an apparatus is forthcoming, we may expect to bring into subjection a very

considerable proportion of the 4,000 invisible horses which Science tells us are to

be found within every acre of tropical ground.

But -whatever may be the future of electricity as a prime mover, either in a

·dominant or subordinate relation to heat, it is certain to be largely used for

mechanical purposes in a secondary capacity, that is to say, as the offspring instead

of the parent of motive power. The most distinctive characteristic of electricity
is that which we express by the word ' current,' and this gives it gi-eat value in

·cases where power is required in a transmissible form. The term may be objected

to as implying a motion of translation analogous to the flow of a liquid through
a pipe, whereas the passage of electricity through a conductor must be regarded

as a wave-like action communicated from particle to particle. In the case of a

fluid current through a pipe, the resistance to the flow increases as tlie square of

the velocity, while in the case of an electric current the resistance through a given

conductor is a constant proportion of the energy transmitted. So far, therefore,

as resistance is concerned, electricity has a great advantage over water for the

transmission of power. The cost of the conductor will, however, be a grave

consideration where the length is gi'eat, because its section must be increased in

proportion to the length to keep the resistance the same. It must also be large

enough in section to prevent heating, which not only represents loss, but impairs

conductivity. To work advantageously on this system, a high electro-motive force

must be used, and this will involve loss by imperfect insulation, increasing in

amount with the length of the line. For these reasons there will be a limit to

the distance to which electricity may be profitably conveyed, but within that limit
there will be wide scope for its employment transmissively. Whenever the time

arrives for utilizing the power of great waterfalls the ti-ansmission of power by
electricity will become a system of vast importance. Even now small streams of

water inconveniently situated for direct appUcation may, by the adoption of this

principle, be brought into useful operation.

    For locomotive purposes also we find the dynamo-electric principle to be

available, as instanced in the very interesting example presented in Siemens' electric

railway, which has already attained that degree of success which generally

foreshadows an important future. It forms a combined fixed engine and

·locomotive system of traction, the fixed engine being the generator of the power

.and the electric engine representing the locomotive.

Steam power may both be transmitted and distributed, by the intervention of

'               but  it  will  labour  under  great  disadvantage  when  thus  applied, until

  electricity,

a thoroughly effective electric accumulator be provided, capable of giving out

Howelectric energy with almost unlimited rapidity.     far the secondary battery

of M. Faiu-e will fulfil the necessaiy conditions remains to be seen, and it is to be

hoped that the discussions which may be expected to take place at this meeting

of the British Association will enable a just estimate of its capabilities to be

formed. The introduction of the Faure battery is at any rate a very important

step in electrical progi-ess. It will enable motors of small power, whatever their

natiu-e may be, to accomplish, by uninterrupted action, the effect of much larger

machines acting for short periods, and by this means the value of very small

streams of water will be greatly enhanced. This will be especially the case where
the power of the stream is required for electric lighting, which, in summer, when

the springs are low, will only be required during the brief hours of darkness,

while in winter the long nights will be met by a more abundant supply of water.

Even the fitful power of wind, now so little used, will probably acquire new life

when aided by a system which will not only collect, but equalize, the variable and

.uncertain power exerted by the air.

It would greatly add to the utility of the Faure battery if its weight and size

could be considerably reduced, for in that case it might be applicable to many

Wepm-poses of locomotion.              may easily conceive its becoming available in a

lighter form for all sorts of carriages on common roads, thereby sa%-ing to a vast

extent the labour of horses. Even the nobler animal that strides a bicycle, or the
one of fainter courage that prefers the safer seat of a tricycle, may ere long be
spared the labour of propulsion, and the time may not be distant when an electric
horse, far more amenable to discipline than the living one, may be added to the

iounteous gifts which science has bestowed on ci^ilized man.
--774 REPORT 1881.

     In conclusion I may observe that we can scarcely aufSciently admire th&

profound investigations which have revealed to us the strict dynamical relation
of heat and electricity to outward mechanical motion. It would be a delicate task
to apportion praise amongst those whose labours have contributed, in various
degrees, to our present knowledge, but I shall do no injustice in saying that of

those who have expounded the modern doctrine of energy, in special relation to
mechanical practice, the names of Joule, Clausius, Rankine, and "William Thompson
will always be conspicuous. But up to this time our knowledge of energy is almost
confined to its inorganic aspect. Of its physiological action we remain in deep igno-
rance, and as we may expect to derive much valuable guidance from a knowledge

of Nature's methods of dealing with energy in her wondrous mechanisms, it is to be
hoped that futm-e research will be directed to the elucidation of that branch of

science which as yet has not even a name, but which I may provisionally term.

    Captain J. B. Eads, G.E.

                              FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.

     The following Papers were read :

1. Some of the Developments of Mechanical Engineering during the last half-

  --century. By Sir F. J. Bramwell, M.I.G.E., F.E.S. See Reports^

     p. 494.

         2. On the Automatic Sounder, By James Dillon, M.I.C.E.

     In this paper the author pointed out the difficulties and delays that have now to
be encountered when endeavouring accurately to prepare soimdings and sections of
the beds of rivers, lakes, harbours, and sea-shores, or when determining the levels

or depths of existing or proposed excavations under water, and excavations and
dredging operations when in progi-ess, and lastly the difficulty in accurately ascer-
taining the character of the ground under water, before designing large hydi-aulic
works, &c.

     The author pointed out how he successfidly overcame these various difficulties

by inventing the ' Automatic Sounder.' Its construction is simple, and with it can
be successfully performed the diflerent operations referred to, with greater accuracy

and at a much less expenditiu-e of time and money, the author having tested and

proved its value on very extensive hydraulic and river conservancy works.
     The following is the author's description of this machine :
      There is placed across a boat, barge, or other floating substance, near stern or

elsevs-here, a metal or other axle-bar, called the ' central axle,' ^\·ith its ends pro-

mjecting a few inches over sides of boat, working freely axle-boxes attached to

sides of the boat.

    Twelve or more feet (according to maximum soundings required) of a metal or

other bar called the ' sounding bar,' is attached to the ' central axle,' the former

hanging vertically in the water. The end of the central axle is passed through a
semicii-cular dial resting on or near the side of the boat, the sounding bar swing-
ing in a plane parallel to the dial and keel of the boat.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  775

   --Method of Workiiuj. When required to prepare soundings or sections for any
--hydraulic work say fifty or one hundred miles of proposed river conservancy works
--to a depth varying from eight to lifteen feet below the surface of the water, it ia

merely necessary to attach fifteen feet of a rough metal or other sounding bar
to the central axle, by a thumbscrew, leaving about two feet of the sounding bar
above the central axle, working in front of and pointing to the dial, placed at the

side of the observer, when sitting in the stern of the boat, to note the dial-readings,
when necessary, in his notebook.

    On the boat being set in motion, the sounding bar (contrary to expectation) will

remain hanging in the vertical position, until it meets with some obstruction or rise
in the ground, when the sounding bar, working round the central axle, will be
pushed from a vertical into a slanting position, and according as its end under water,
resting on the ground, is raised from fitteen to less depths below the surface of the
water, say to ten, five, and two feet, the other shorter end of the sounding bar
will point to ten, live, and two feet on the dial. If any greater obstruction raises
the lower end of the sounding bar to the surface of the water, then its upper end

will point to zero on the dial.

   A horizontal roll of ' section paper ' is placed at back of the dial or elsewhere,

kept in motion at a given rate by a simple arrangement of clockwork, or by float-
boards or a screw worked by the resistance of the water when the boat is rowed or

otherwise set in motion.

    On the section paper is marked to scale a perfect contour line, representing the

surface of the ground below water, by a pencil pointer or pen attached to the
central axle, which latter is kept in motion by the rise and fall of the sounding bar
firmly screwed to it.

    The author, however, states that the section paper may be frequently dispensed

with, and the character of the surface of the ground accurately defined by the
action of the instrument under water, as more fully described in his paper. The

instrument is designed to enable the observer to enter all necessary information in

his notebook, three or more scales being marked on the semicircidar dial, to suit
sounding bars ten, twenty, or more feet in length.

3. On the Economical Effect of using Cheap Oasfor Gas-motors, with a descrip.
 Hon of Apparatus for producing such Gas. By J. Emeeson Dowson, C.E.

     After describing what had been done by other inventors, the author

--gave the following particulars of his apparatus: The retort or generator

consists of a vertical cylindrical iron casing which encloses a thick lining
of ganister, as in a foundry cupola, to prevent loss of heat and oxidation of
the metal, and at the bottom of this cylinder is a grate on which a fire is built
up. Under the grate is a closed chamber, and a jet of superheated steam
plays into this and carries with it by induction a continuous current of air. The
pressure of the steam forces the mixture of steam and air upwards through the
nre, so that the combustion of the fuel is maintained while a continuous current of

steam is decomposed, and in this way the working of the genei'ator is constantj and
the gas is produced without fluctuations in quality. The steam is produced and
superheated in a zigzag coil heated by gas. The nature of the fuel required

depends on the purpose for which the gas is used. If for heating boilers, fm-naces,

&c., coke or any kind of coal may be used ; but for gas-engines, or any application

of the gas requiring great cleanliness and freedom from sulphur and ammonia, it is
best to use anthracite, as this does not yield condensable vapours and is very free
from impurities. To produce 1,000 c. ft. only 12 lb. of anthracite are required (allow-

ing 8 to 10% for impurities and waste) and about 7 pints of water. The cost of

making the gas depends to a certain extent on the size of the generator. Experience
with 16 generators has shown that the three sizes in use, producing respectively
1,000, 1,500, and 2,500 c. ft. per hour, make gas at a cost of 4^c?., Zyi., and 2\d. per
1,000 c. ft. (including repairs, depreciation, and interest on capital outlay). Ap-
proximately the composition of the gas thus made is : Hydrogen 20%, carbon
776 REPOBT-- 1881.

monoxide 30%, carbon dioxide 3%, and nitrogen, &c., 47% by volume. This
gives about 50% by volume of combustible gases, and the calorific power of 100

litres is 155,836 gramme-unita of heat. Its calorific intensity is 2,268° C. Ordinary

London coal-gas of average composition has a calorific power of 559,038 gramme-

units for 100 litres, so that its calorific power is about 3'5 times greater than that

of the Dowson gas. Its calorific intensity is 2,564° C. The comparative explosive

force of the two gases is as 3-4 : 1, i.e. coal-gas has 3'4 times more energy than

the writer's gas ; but because the combustion of the carlx)n monoxide proceeds at a

comparatively slow rate, and because of the diluents present in the cylinder, which

afiect the weaker gas more than coal-gas, experience has shown that with an Otto
engine it is best to allow five volumes of the Dowson gas for one volume of coal-gas.

The economical result is that there is a saving of about 50% in the total working

cost ; and another practical consideration is that coal-gas requires 220 to 250 tb of

coal per 1,000 c. ft. of gas, but the author's requires only 12 It. per 1,000 c. ft., and

multiplying this by 5 to give the equivalent power of 1,000 c. ft. of coal-gas, for

engine work, there is only 24 to 27% of the weight of coal required for coal-gas, and

in many outlying districts this will eftect an appreciable saving in the cost of transport.

The results obtained by trials of this gas with a 3J h, p. Otto engine have proved
that one h.p. {indicated) per hour is obtained with a consumption of gas derived from

1'46 tt). coal, after allomng 10% for impurities and waste of the latter. With

engines of larger power the loss due to friction is proportionally less, and the con-

sumption of gas per ind. h.p. is less : thus with a 16 h.p. (nominal) engine, which

can indicate up to about 40 h.p., the consumption of coal would be only 1-2 lb. per

Aind. lip. per hour.  practical illustration of the relative working cost of an

ordinary steam-engine of the portable type, a gas-engine driven with coal gas,

and a gas-engine driven with Dowson gas (in each case indicating 30 h.p.) was

given, and this showed that the gas-engine driven with Dowson gas would cost

about 45|% less than with coal-gas at .3s. per 1,000 c. ft., and about 47j% less

than the steam-engine, consuming 6 lb. of coal per ind. h.p. per hour. Tlie most

striking feature, however, was that with the steam-engine 217 tons of coal would

be required to give tlie same power as 39 tons of coal converted into gas by the

author's process and afterwards used in a gas-engine. This represents a .saving in

weiglit of fuel of 88%. For the special reasons given it is best to allow 5 volumes

of the author's gas for 1 vol. of ordinary coal-gas when worked with an Otto engine,

but in all applications of the gas to heating purposes experience has shown that

about 3'5 vols, of this are equal to 1 vol. of coal-gas. If, therefore, the cost of

production above stated, for gas made on a small scale, be multiplied by 3'5 there

will be a mean of Is. as the total cost of the proved equivalent of 1,000 c. ft. of

coal gas for heating purposes.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 5.

The following Papers were read :

1, On Telegraphic PJiotographij . By Shelford Bidwell, M.A., LL.B.

    The apparatus now explained is a development of that described in ' Nature,'

February 10, 1881, and exhibited at a meeting of the Physical Society on

February 26. Its purpose is to illustrate a method of transmitting pictui-es of

natural objects by telegraph.

The receiving instrument contains a platinum-covered brass cylinder, 2 inches

long and | inch in diameter, mounted horizontally upon a spindle 7 inches long.
One of the projecting ends of the spindle has a screw cut upon it of 64 threads to

the inch ; the other end is left plain. The spindle revolves in two bearings, the

distance between which is equal to twice the  length  of  the  cylinder                                  and  one  of
                                                                                                      ;
Athe bearings has an inside screw corresponding to that upon the spindle.

platinum point, attached to an elastic brass arm, which is fixed midway between

the two bearings, presses normally upon the surface of the cylinder. The positive

pole of a local battery is connected through a set of resistance coils with the

platinum point, and the negative pole with the metal cylinder. If now a piece of

paper which has been soaked in a solution of iodide of potassium be wrapped

round the cylinder, and the cylinder be caused to rotate, the platinum point will, so

long as the current passes, trace a veiy close spiral brown line upon the paper.

When the strength of the current is diminished, the intensity of the line is

enfeebled ; when the current is interrupted the line is broken off, and the paper

retains its original whiteness. It is evident that by regulating the intensity of the

line thus traced, and introducing gaps in the proper places, any design or picture

might be represented upon the paper. This is the system adopted in Bakewell's

well-knovra copying telegraph. The author's instrument, however, differs from

his in that the current is varied simply by the action of light.

    At the transmitting station is a second battery, which is connected by two

line wires (one of which would, in practice, be replaced by the earth) with the

receiving instrument, so that the cmTeut passes through the prepared paper in the
opposite direction to that of the current from the local battery. If the two

currents through the paper are of equal strength they will neutralise each other,

and the platinum point wiU make no mark when the cylinder rotates : if the

current from the local battery is stronger than that from the other, the usual

brown mark will appear, its intensity depending upon the difference between the

Strength of the two currents.

In the circuit of the second battery is introduced the transmitting instrument,

the purpose of which is to regulate the current in such a manner as to produce

the desired effects. The action of the transmitter depends upon the ciuious

property of crystalline selenium, that its electrical resistance is greater in the

dark than in the light. The current is caused to pass through a selenium cell,

enclosed in a small rectangular box, from which all light is excluded, except such

as can pass through a pinhole, drilled in the side of the box opposite to the cell.

By means of a mechanical arrangement, which, though very simple, cannot easily

"be described without a drawing, the box is connected with a horizontal spindle in

such a manner that each revolution of the spindle causes the box to move

perpendicularly up and down, through a distance of 2 inches, and at the same

~time laterally through inch. If now a picture, not more than 2 inches square,

is projected by a photographic lens upon that side of the box which contains the

pinhole, it is clear that by turning the spindle the pinhole may be caused to pass

successively over every point of the focussed image. The box, while moving in the

upward direction, travels through space at precisely the same rate as a point on the

surface of the receiving cylinder, when the spindles of the two instruments are

revolving synchronously : the downward movement is rapid and is not concerned in

the transmission of the picture.
--778 BBPORT 1881.

     To prepare the iustruments for work, a piece of sensitised paper is wrapped'
round the cylinder of the receiver, and the platinum point pressed gently upon it r

the pinhole in the transmitter is brought to the brightest part of the focussed
picture, and the variable resistance in the circuit of the local battery is so adjusted
that the two currents, passing through the paper in opposite directions, exactly

balance each other. The cylinder and the box are then moved to their extreme
positions, and all is ready to commence operations.

     The two spindles are caused to revolve uniformly and synchronously. The pin-
hole, in the course of its up-and-down path, will cover successively every point of
the projected picture, and the amoimt of light falling at any moment upon the

selenium cell will be proportional to the illumination of that particular spot of the

picture which, for the time being, is occupied by the pinhole. When the pinhole

is in the dark, the resistance of the selenium cell is increased, the current from the
local battery predominates, and the platinum point traces a dark brown line upon

the paper ; but when the pinhole happens to be passing over a bright part of the

picture, the resistance of the selenium is diminished ; a stronger current is then
opposed to that from the local battery, and the line traced by the point is enfeebled

or altogether broken. The close spiral line thus described, with the breaks in its
uniformity, constitutes a picture which, if the instrument were perfect, would be a
monochromatic counterpart of that projected upon the transmitter.

     The pictures hitherto actually transmitted by this experimental apparatus are
simple designs in black and white, painted upon glass, and projected by a magic
lantern. The image of a butterfly with well-defined marks upon its wings, and a
rude drawong, in broad lines, of a human face, are among the objects which have
been most successfully reproduced. But with a more delicate, selenium cell and
more sensitive paper, there is little doubt that the efficiency of the instrument
might be almost indefinitely increased.

            2. On the Swan Incandescont Lamp. By J. W. Swan.

3. On Electric Lighting as applied to Goal Mines. By Andrew Jamieson,

      In the discussion which followed the exhibition of Swan's lamp at the Society
of Telegraph Engineers in October last, Professor Tyndall remarked that probably
this form of incandescent lamp could be adapted for use in coal mines as a safety
lamp. Since then, two practical trials have been made with that object in view,
the one at Pleasely Colliery, near Nottingham, the other at Earuock Colliery,
near Glasgow. The circumstances under which the lighting has to be produced

and maintained are new and ditfiereut in many respects from that now being carried

out above ground in our halls, houses, and open spaces. Dangers and dithculties
peculiar to the situation have to be guarded against or overcome, such as explosive
gases, subsiding walls or seam-roofs, continuous darkness, &c. Long lengths of

leading wu-e have to be dealt with, involving many branches or oS'shoots,
requiring considerable mechanical skill and still more electrical knowledge, before

 a suitable distribution of the eleetric current is effected, and the desired uniformity
 and intensity of light obtained. Particular interest is at present being manifested

by mine owners, managers, and engineers to know the commercial value of the

 light, or, in other words, whether the possible increased light and safety of Swan's
 lamps over the methods hitherto adopted will residt in an economy and in an
increased output of coal for the same expense of labour. The author described
 the apparatus used at Pleasely and Earnock collieries, with models of strong miners'
 lanterns encasing Swan's lamps, and of airtight contact-makers of various
 designs and patterns, for preventing the inevitable spark (which always takes place
 upon disconnecting leading wires or lamps) from causing danger in a fiery mine.

He pointed out that the plan of joining up a number of Swan's lamps in single

 parallel, with a self-exciting Gramme, Siemens, or other form of dynamo-macliiue.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  779"

was neither tlie most economical nor handy for management, from the fact that the
lamps required to be specially ordered and made of a slightly decreasing resistance
in proportion to their distance along the main leads from the generator, and that
ndthout a costly and deUcate current regulator there was considerable risk in spoiling

the remaining lamps upon turning out a number of them. He said the plan of
introducing an equivalent resistance to that of the lamp turned out was equiva-

lent to throwing away so much energy, or coal, because the resistance so introduced
absorbed power equal in fact to that of the lamp or lamps which it replaced.
Finally, he gave several plans for joining up the lamps which, in his opinion, were
more economical and better, and he stated that by using Siemens' dynamo-exciters

with their alternate current machines, the danger accruing from suddenly turning
out a number of lamps was avoided, as the electro-motive force remained prac-
tically constant (with low resistance leads and generator coil), and therefore the
current passing the remaining lamp or lamps was always the same. For example,
if 49 lamps out of 50 were suddenly switched out of circuit, the remaining lamp
would not be endangered, and would have the same current passing through it and

give the same light as before. He reviewed in detail the most approved mechanical

and electrical apparatus for installing electric lighting in coal mines, and

mentioned that he had found by experiment that good Swan lamps will give forth

light at the rate of 220 candle-power per horse-power absorbed by them.

4. On a New Form of Lightning Conductor, which can he easily tested.
                                  By Samuel Vtle.

Last year a paper was read before this Section of the British Association, draw-

ing special attention to the great damage done to life and property by lightning,
and pointing out the need that existed of periodically testing and inspecting

lightning conductors, with a view to their being always liept in an efficient condi-
tion. There is, however, very great difficulty in the present method of testing

conductors, it being a necessary preliminary to such test that some one be found
vsith nerve and sldll enough to carry a testing wire from the gi'ound and connect it
metalhcally with the top of the conductor. The electrician, having the other end of

the wire below, is then in a position to commence Ms test. Where conductors are

attached to lofty spires or high chimneys, there is both cost and danger, which

is probably the reason why so few conductors are ever tested. This neglect to

ascertain their condition leads to deterioration and ultimate danger, and it is more

than probable fosters a widely extended belief that conductors are comparatively

useless.

     Recognising this difficulty in the method of testing, and noticing the emphatic
utterances of scientific men as to the absolute necessity of testing lightning con-

ductors, the author was led last year to devise a new form, which is now exhibited.

     It consists of a copper cable carrying an insulated wire as its core, which wire
being metallically connected with the outer cable at the top, offers a ready means of

testing its condition at any time without any of the difficulty hitherto experienced

in testing conductors.

     Having then a wire always connected to the top of the conductor, a test can be
taken when desired. This can be accomplished either on the tangent, balance, or

differential principles, either of which will enable the resistance of the conductor to

be ascertained. The author had adopted the latter method, the galvanometer being
-- Afitted with three keys A, B, and C. By depressing key
                                                           on the left hand a

deflection of the galvanometer needle takes place by reason of the passage of a

current from the battery through one coil of the galvanometer to the insulated wire
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  781

Tvitliin the cable to tlie top, whence it descends by the latter to the earth. Unless

the continuity of the testing wire and cable be good no current ^N-ill pass, and the

Bneedle remains still. On depressing a cnrrent is sent in the opposite direction

through a resistance-coil to the earth. If the needle be deflected, the apparatus is

proved to be ready for the resistance test, which is made by the depression of keys

A Band both at the same time. The current then divides itself equally between

the circuit formed by the insulated wire and conductor, and a resistance which
should be made exactly equal to the other circuit ; this being so, any defect in the

lightning conductor would manifest itself by the needle not balancing, but showing

a deflection. In such a case key C is brought into use, and its depression at th&

Bsame time as shows whether the earth of the conductor is good, or if the fault is
Bto be looked for above ground, as the current is then divided between and 0,

whose resistances are equal.

   A very sensitive galvanometer needle is required, as a good conductor of average

length would only be about T^^tli of an ohm. One having the needle suspended by

a silk fibre above, and kept in position by another such fibre below, will respond

not only to j^th of an ohm, but even to joW*^ thereof.

5. On an Organisation for the Systematic Gauging of the Wells, Springs,
            and Rivers of Great Britain. By Joseph Lucas, F.G.S.

     It has long been felt by engineers and others that tbere should be a survey of
the sources of water-supply in this country. In the last few years several isolated
observers, anticipating any general organisation on this behalf, have been registering
various items of account, such as the variation in the level of water in wells, but
they have never been collected and brought side by side with others, sucb as the
rainfall, percolation, barometric pressure, and temperature, all of which influence
the supply, or collated and reduced to perspective on maps, except over a very
limited area in the South of England.

     This very isolation, however, greatly impedes the usefulness of the work, and
it is very desirable that an influential committee should be appointed to direct and
systematise these separate efibrts, and to take charge of the work till it is finally
committed to responsible hands.

     There is a committee of this Association, founded in 1874, and there is another-
of the Meteorological Society, at work upon underground water. Mr. Baldwin
Latham has a large series of wells, springs, and rivers under observation, and there
are several other observers at work in various parts of the country.

     This, however, is a task too large for individuals or even societies, and should,,
the author thinks, be executed at the public cost. Since April last, he has been
receiving returns of gaugings and other observations on surface and subterranean
water-economy from observers in various parts of England, and these returns, two

of which are now ready, will be published monthly till some better arrangement
can be made. Until this time amves the author will gladly receive observations

from any observers of the variations in the wells, springs, and rivers of these islands,,

and supply proper forms, and the returns as they are published, to anyone who may

take an interest in any of the various aspects of the water question.

                                  EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE.
  Eighteen years have now passed since this Commentary on the Holy Scriptures was

undertaken. Its publication was commenced ten years ago, and the concluding volume
is now presented to the public. Its conception was due to the late Lord Ossington, then
Speaker of the House of Commons, and to that circumstance it owes its familiar title of

"The Speaker's Commentary "--a title, however, which derives a further justification

»***«from the warm interest he maintained in the progress of the work and the constant

encouragement it received from him.

   The Editor cannot but express his deep thankfulness that a work involving so many
difficulties, and liable to so many unforeseen disturbances, should thus have been brought

******to its conclusion without any substantial deviation either from the principles or the form

adopted and explained at its commencement.

   As stated on the title page, it was from the outset a primary purpose of the Commen-

tary to furiyish in the notes corrected translations of all passages in which the old version
required revision. These emendations of the authorized version, when deemed certain,

have throughout the work been printed in a distinctive type, daiker than the rest of the

note ; and the reader is thus enabled to see at a glance every correction in rendering
which modern scholarship has made really necessary. The work thus done presents sub-

--.''tantially the advantages of a revised version a circumstance on which it is desirable to

insist in view of the scheme for providing such a version, which about eight years after-

Author of " Equatorial Africa," " Ashango Land," &c.

    "It was certainly an original idea on the part of Mr. Du Chaillu to devote the best part of

eight years to the exploration of Scandinavia in as deliberate a manner as if it were an
unknown land, visited for the first time by a civilized explorer. The result on the whole is
wonderfully novel and fresh. The author's rambling records have all the charm of an original

record of travel, combined with the piquancy of gossip. Altogether Mr. Du Chaillu's work is

likely to become one of the most popular books of the season."-- r^e Times.

    "No one can rise from the study of Mr. Darwin's new work, which is one of the most

interesting he has written, without thenceforth feeling something like tenderness and respect
for the hitherto loathed worm, even if he hesitates to credit it with all the stupendous feats
which its advocate attributes to it. Mr. Darwin has elevated the creature from a cumberer of
the ground to the rank of a benefactor of our race, and has by his researches thrown another
fresh flood of light upon the workings of Nature." The Times.

    " Dean Stanley's literary style has lost nothing of its charm. So daintily does he select
his words, and so deftly does he arrange them, that his sentences seem natural productions,
having the symmetry and beauty of spontaneous growth. There is neither elaboration nor
effort ; simply an artistic instinct informed by a large knowledge, and regulated by scholarly
culture. But the result is very charming in its simple beauty and perfect rhythm.

  "We must leave this interesting and fascinating book to the discrimination of its readers.

Few books that have latterly come into our hands are more charming, or more need the

function of descriminating scriptural knowledge and good sense." British Quarterly Review.

whole group of back-hoitcd animals .... but the subject has been so treated as to fit it also to

serve as an introduction to Zoology generally, and even to Biology .... The sciences sub-

ordinate to Biology are also enumerated and defined."
   One of the principal features of this worlc is that, while giving a detailed account of one

animal, it serves to explain the principles and leading facts of all the different sciences with
which the student of Natural History has to deal.
