the Secretaries are to correct, on a copy of the Journal, the list of papers
which have been read on that day, to add to it a list of those appointed
to be read on the next day, and to send this copy of the Journal as early

in the day as possible to the Printer, who is charged with printing the

     The Committees will take into consideration any suggestions which may
 be offered by their Members for the advancement of Science. They are

 specially requested to review the recommendations adopted at preceding
 Meetings, as published in the volumes of the Association and the com-

 selecting definite points of research to which individual or combined
 exertion may be usefully directed, and branches of knowledge on the state
 and progress of which Reports are wanted ; to name individuals or Com-
 mittees for the execution of such Reports or researches ; and to state
 whether, and to what degree, these objects may be usefully advanced by
 the appropriation of the funds of the Association, by application to

 it is expedient that all Members of the Committee should be named, and
 one of them appointed to act as Secretary, for insuring attention to business.

ance they may require.

able on each grant.

     Grants of money sanctioned at any one Meeting of the Association

           KEPOKT OF THE COUNCIL.

                     REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

^ejport of the Council for the year 1879-80, presented to the General
               Committee at Swansea, on Wednesday, August 25, 1880.

     The Council have received Repoi-ts dxiring the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the

Oeneral Committee this day.
     The Council having been requested by the General Committee at

Sheffield to take such further action as regards the correspondence with
the Treasury about the Natural History Collections as they should think
desirable in the interests of science, have prepared and sent to the
Secretary of the Treasury, in reply to his letter of July 22, 1879, the

following letter :

                                        British Association for the Advancement of Science,

                                                              22 Albemarle Street, London, W.

                                                                                                        June 8, 1880.

   --Sir, The letter of the Council of this Association, of March 25, 1879,

respecting the administration of the Natural History Collections, and
your reply thereto of July 22, have been laid before the British Asso-
ciation, at the meeting held at Sheffield in August last, when the subject

was again referred to the Council.

     On the part of the Council I am now requested to inform you that

they learn with satisfaction that the action of Her Majesty's Government,

in passing the British Museum Act of 1878, does not prejudice the ques-

tion of the future administration of the Natural History Collections at
 South Kensington, but that the subject is still under the consideration of

the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury.
      Under these circumstances, the Council of the Association must again

-express their hope that, when the period arrives, as it must shortly do,
for the settlement of the question, the recommendations of the Royal
Commission on Science will have their full weight and importance

accorded to them.

     If, however, the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury are
 prepared, as they would seem to indicate, to constitute a Special Standing
Committee, or Sub-Committee, of the Trustees of the British Museum,
for the management of the Natural History Collections, the Council of
the Association are of opinion that such a form of governinent, though
not the form suggested by the Royal Commission on Science, might
.possibly be so organised as to be satisfactory both to the public and to

-men of science.
      Trusting that the Lords Commissioners will do the Council the favour

of considering these observations on a subject which keenly interests

many members of the British Association,

       I have the honour to be, Sir,

                                      Your obedient servant,

                                          G. J. Allman,

       President of the British Association for the

                                      Advancement of Science.

Sir R. R. W. LiNGEN. K.C.B., &c. &c.

The receipt of this letter has been acknowledged.

    A letter having been received from the Secretary of the Anthropo-

metric Committee, requesting that the Council would address a Memorial
to the Education Department, requesting the Department to assist
the Committee in obtaining certain statistics as to the development of
children in Board Schools, it was resolved that a Committee, consisting
of Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Francis Galton, Mr. Heywood, and the General
OflBcers, should be appointed to consider the subject and to report to the
Council thereon. Owing to the unavoidable absence of several of the
members, the Committee have as yet been unable to make any report tO'
the Council upon the subject.

     The Council have resolved, on the request of the Tidal Observation,

Committee, that the best thanks of the Association be given to the First
Lord of the Admiralty, the President of the Board of Trade, the French
Minister of Public "Works, the Belgian Minister of Public Works, and to-
the several other authorities and private individuals, both in this country

and on the Continent, who have kindly and gratuitously had the various
observations carried out and communicated to this Committee ; and more
especially to the French Association for the Advancement of Science for

its cordial assistance in supporting the proposal of the British Association,

and in urging it upon the French Minister of Public Works.
     The Council have to announce that they have elected Professor Cornu,

of Paris, and Professor Boltzmann, of Vienna, Corresponding Members^

since the Sheffield meeting.

      Applications for free or ' exchange ' copies of the Reports of the
Association being from time to time received, the Assistant Secretary has
been directed to reply to such applications : 1 . That a few remaining sets
from 1831 to 1874 can be siipplied at lOL per set, and all other volumes
between 1831 and 1874 which are in stock at 2s. 6d. per volume net.
2. That all volumes after 1874 can be supplied at the publication price of
24s, per volume. 3. That the Reports for 1839 and 1840 are out of prints
and that only a very few copies remain of those for 1833, 1838, and 1850.

     As the Committee are aware, the Association have already determined
to hold the Meeting for 1881 at York, and thus to commence the second
half-century of their existence in the same city as that in which the
Association was founded in 1831.

     For 1882 and the following years invitations are expected to be pre-
sented at the present meeting from Soathport, Southampton, Nottingham
and Leicester.

     The Council propose that, in accordance with the regulations, the five
retiring members shall be the following :

Barlow, W. H., Esq., F.R.S.           Ommanney, Admiral Sir E., C.B.^

          ANDEEW CROI^IBIE RAMSAY, Esq,

                                    PRESIDENT.

On the Recukrence of Certain Phenomena in Geological Time.

In this address I propose to consider the recurrence of the same kind of

incidents throughout all geological time, as exhibited in the various for-

mations and groups of formations that now form the known parts of the

external crust of the earth. This kind of investigation has for many

myyears forced itself on  attention,  and the  method I adopt  has not here-

tofore been attempted in all its branches. In older times, Hutton and

Playfair, in a broad and general manner, clearly pointed the way to the
doctrine of uniformity of action and results, throughout all known geo-

logical epochs down to the present day ; but after a time, like the prophets

of old, they obtained but slight attention, and were almost forgotten, and

the wilder cosmical theories of Werner more generally ruled the opinions

of the geologists of the time. Later still, Lyell followed in the steps of

Playfair, with all the advantages that the discoveries of William Smith

afforded, and aided by the labours of that band of distinguished geologists,

Sedgwick, Buckland, Mantel!, De la Beche, Murchison, and others, all
of whom some of us knew. Notwithstanding this new light, even now

there still lingers the relics of the belief (which some of these geologists

also maintained), that the physical phenomena which produced the older

strata were not only different in kind, bat also in degree from those which

now rule the external world. Oceans, the waters of which attained a high

temperature, attended the formation of the immitive crystalline rocks.

Volcanic eruptions, with which those of modei'n times are comparatively

insignificant, the sudden upheaval of great mountain chains, the far more

rapid decomposition and degradation of rocks, and, as a consequence, the

--more rapid deposition of strata formed from their waste all these were

assumed as certainties, and still linger in some parts of the world among

living geologists of deservedly high reputation. The chief object of this

1880.                                 B
--2 REPORT 1880.

address is, therefore, to attempt to sLow, that whatever may have been
the state of the world long before geological history began, as now written
in the rocks, all known formations are comparatively so recent in geologi-

cal time, that there is no reason to believe that they were produced under
physical circumstances differing either in kind or degree from those with

which we are now more or less familiar.

    It is unnecessary for my present purpose to enter into details con-

nected with the recurrence of marine foi'mations, since all geologists

know that the greater part of the stratified rocks were deposited in the

sea, as proved by the molluscs and other fossils which they contain, and
the order of their deposition and the occasional stratigraphical breaks in

succession are also famihar subjects. What I have partly to deal with

now, are exceptions to true marine stratified formations, and after some
other important questions have been considered, I shall proceed to discuss
the origin of various non-marine deposits from nearly the earliest

known time down to what by comparison may almost be termed the

present day.

                                                Meiamorphism,

      All, or nearly all, stratified formations have been in a sense meta-
morphosed, since, excepting certain limestones, the fact of loose incoherent
sediments having been by pressure and other agencies turned into solid
rocks constitutes a kind of metamorphism. This, however, is only a first
step toward the kind of metamorphism the frequent recu.rreuce of which

in geological time I have now to insist upon, and which implies that con-
solidated strata have undergone subsequent changes of a kind much more

remarkable.

     Common stratified rocks chiefly consist of marls, shales, slates, sand-

stones, conglomerates, and limestones, generally distinct and definite ; but

not infrequently a stratum, or strata, may partake of the characters in

varied proportions of two or more of the above-named species. It is
from such strata that metamorphic rocks have been produced, exclusive of
the metamorphism of igneous rocks, on which I will not enter. These

may be looked for in manuals of geology, and sometimes they may be

found in them.

     As a general rule, metamorphic rocks are apt to be much contorted,

not only on a large scale, but also that the individual layers of mica
quartz and felspar in gneiss are bent and folded in a great number of

minute convolutions, so small that they may be counted by the hundred

in a foot or two of rock. Such metamorphic rocks are often associated
with masses of granite both in bosses and in interstratified beds or layers,
and where the metamorphism becomes extreme it is often impossible to
draw a boundary line between the gneiss and the granite ; while, on the
other hand, it is often impossible to draw any true boundary between
gneiss (or other metamorphic rocks) and the ordinary strata that have
ADDRESS.  6

partly undergone metamorpliism. Under these circumstances, it is not
surprising that when chemically analysed, there is often little difference in
the constituents of the unmetamorphosed and the metamorphosed rock.
This is a point of some importance in relation to the origin and non-
primitive character of gneiss and other varieties of foliated strata, and
also of some quartzites and crystalline limestones.

    I am aware that in North America formations consisting of meta-

morphic rocks have been stated to exist of older date than the Laurentian
gneiss, and under any circumstances it is obvious that vast tracts of pre-
Laurentian land must have existed in all regions, by the degradation of
which, sediments were derived wherewith to provide materials for the de-
position of the originally unaltered Laurentian strata. In England, Wales,

and Scotland attempts have also been made to prove the presence of more

ancient formations, but I do not consider the data provided sufficient to
warrant any such conclusion. In the Highlands of Scotland, and in
some of the Western Isles, there are gneissic rocks of pre-Cambrian age,

which, since they were first described by Sir Roderick Murchison in the
North-west Highlands, have been, I think justly, considered to belong to
the Laurentian series, unconformably underlying Cambrian and Lower
Silurian rocks, and as yet there are no sufficient grounds for dissenting
from his conclusion that they form the oldest known rocks in the British.

Islands.

      It is unnecessary here to discuss the theory of the causes that produced

the metamorphism of stratified rocks, and it may be sufficient to say, that

under the influence of deep underground heat, aided by moisture, sand-
stones have been converted into quartzites, limestones have become
crystalline, and in shaley, slaty, and schistose rocks, under like circum-
stances, there is little or no development of new material, but rather, in
the main, a re-arrangement of constituents according to their chemical
affinities in rudely crystalline layers, which have very often been more or
less developed in pre-existing planes of bedding. The materials of the
whole are approximately the same as those of the unaltered rock, but
liave been re-arranged in layers, for example, of quartz, felspar, and mica,
or of hornblende, &c., while other minerals, such as schorl and garnets,

are of not infrequent occurrence.
     It has for years been an established fact that nearly the whole of the

mountain masses of the Highlands of Scotland (exclusive of the Laurentian,

Cambrian, and Old Red Sandstone formations), mostly consist of gneissic
rocks of many varieties, and of quartzites and a few bands of crystalline
limestone, which, from the north shore to the edge of the Old Red Sand-
stone, are repeated again and again in stratigraphical convolutions great
and small. Many large bosses, veins, and dykes of granite are asso-

ciated with these rocks, and, as already stated, it sometimes happens that
it is hard to draw a geological line between granite and gneiss and vice
versa. These rocks, once called Primary or Primitive, were first proved
by Sir Roderick Murchison to be of Lower Silurian age, thus revolu-

tionisiug the geology of nearly one-half of Scotland. To the same age

belongs by far the greater part of the broad hilly region of the south of
Scotland that lies between St. Abb's Head on the east and the coast of
Ayrshire and Wigtonshire on the west. In the south-west part of this

district, several great masses of granite rise amid the Lower Silurian

rocks, which in their neighbourhood pass into mica-schist and even into

fine-grained gneiss.

    In Cornwall tbe occurrence of Silurian rocks is now well known.
They are of metamorphic character, and partly associated with granite ;,

and at Start Point, in South Devonshire, the Silurian strata have been
metamorphosed into quartzites.

In parts of the Cambrian areas, Silurian rocks in contact with granite

have been changed into crystalline hornblendic gneiss, and in Anglesey

there are large tracts of presumed Cambrian strata, great part of which

have been metamorphosed into chlorite and mica-schist and gneiss, and

the same is partly the case with the Lower Silurian rocks of the centre

of the island, where it is almost impossible to disentangle them from the

associated granite.

     In Ireland similar metamorphic rocks are common, and, on the

authority of Prof. Hull, who knows them well, the following statements
are founded :-- ' Metamorphism in Ireland has been geographical and not

stratigraphical, and seems to have ceased before the Upper Silurian

period.

' The epoch of greatest metamorphism appears to have been that which

intervened between the close of the Lower Silurian period and the
commencement of the Upper Silurian, taking the formations in ascending

order.

     ' It is as yet undecided whether Laurentian rocks occur in Ireland.

There are rocks in north-west Mayo very like those in Sutherlandshire,

but if they are of Laurentian age they come directly iinder the meta-

morphosed Lower Silurian rocks, and it may be very difficult to separate

them.

     ' Cambrian purple and green grits are not metamorphosed in the coun-
ties of Wicklow and Dublin, but the same beds at the southern extremity
of County "Wexford, near Carnsore Point, have been metamorphosed into

mica-schist and gneiss.

' In the east of Ireland the Lower Silurian grits and slates have not

been metamorphosed, except where in proximity to granite, into which

they insensibly pass in the counties of "Wicklow, Dublin, "Westmeath,

Cavan,   Longford,   and Down                                                    but in  the west and  north-west of  Ireland
                                                                              ;

they have been metamorphosed into several varieties of schists, horn-

blende-rock, and gniess, or foliated granite.'
     It would be easy to multiply cases of the metamorphism of Silurian

rocks on the continent of Europe, as, for example, in Scandinavia, and in
the Ural Mountains, where, according to Murchison, 'by following its

masses upon their strike, we are assured that the same zone which in one
ADDRESS.  5

 tract has a mechanical aspect and is fossiliferous, graduates in another
parallel of latitude into a metamorphic crystalline condition, whereby not
only the organic remains, but even the original impress of sedimentary
origin are to a great degree obliterated.' The same kind of phenomena

are common in Canada and the United States ; and Medlicott and Blan-
ford, in ' The Geology of India,' have described the thorough metamor-
phism of Lower Silurian strata into gneiss and syenitic and hornblende

 schists.

      In Britain, none of the Upper Silurian rocks have undergone any
serious change beyond that of ordinary consolidation, but in the Eastern
Alps at Gratz, Sir Roderick Murchison has described both Upper
Silurian and Devonian strata interstratified with separate courses of
metamorphic chloritic schist.

     Enough has now been said to prove the frequent occurrence of
metamorphic action among Cambrian and Lower and Upper Silurian

 strata.

     If we now turn to the Devonian and Old Red Sandstone strata of
England and Scotland, we find that metamorphic action has also been at
work, but in a much smaller degree. In Cornwall and Devon, five great

bosses of granite stand out amid the stratified Silurian, Devonian, and
·Carboniferous formations. Adjoining or near these bosses the late Sir

Henry De la Beche remarks, that ' in numerous localities we find the

coarser slates converted into rocks resembling mica-slate and gneiss, a
fact particularly well exhibited in the neighbourhood of Meavy, on the
south-east of Tavistock,' and ' near Camelford we observed a fine arena-
ceous and micaceous grauwacke turned into a rock resembling mica-slate
near the granite.' Other cases are given by the same author, of slaty

strata turned into mica-schist and gneiss in rocks now generally con-

sidered to be of Devonian age.

     The Devonian rocks and Old Red Sandstone are of the same geological

age, though they were deposited under different conditions, the first being

of marine, and the latter of fresh-water, origin. The Old Red Sandstone

of "Wales, England, and Scotland has not, as far as I know, suffered any
metamorphism, excepting in one case in the north-east of Ayrshire, near

the sources of the Avon Water, where a large boss of granite rises

through the sandstone, which all round has been rendered crystalline
with well-developed crystals of felspar.

     On the continent of Europe, a broad area of Devonian strata lies on

both banks of the Rhine and the Moselle. Forty years ago, Sedgwick
and Murchison described the crystalline quartzites, chlorite, and micaceous
slates of the Hundsruck and the Taunus, and from personal observation

I know that the rocks in the country on either side of the Moselle are, in

places, of a foliated or semi-foliated metamorphic character. In the Alps
also, as already noticed, metamorphic Devonian strata occur interstratified

with beds of metamorphic schists, and. Sir Rodei'ick adds, ' we have

ample data to afi&rm, that large portions of the Eastern Alps . , . are
--6 EEPORT 1880.

occupied by rocks of true palasozoic age, whicli in many parts have passed

into a crystalline state.'

    I know of no case in Britain where the Carboniferous strata have

been thoroughly metamorphosed, excepting that in South Wales, beds

of coal, in the west of Caermarthenshire and in South Pembrokeshire,

gradually pass from so-called bituminous coal into anthracite. The same

is the case in the United States, in both instances the Carboniferous strata

being exceedingly disturbed and contorted. In the Alps, however, Sir

Roderick Murchison seems to have believed that Carboniferous rocks may

have been metamorphosed : a circumstance since undoubtedly proved by

the occurrence of a coal-measure calamite, well preserved, but otherwise

partaking of the thoroughly crystalline character of the gneiss in which

it is imbedded, and which was shown to me by the late Prof. Gastaldi, at

Turin,

I am well acquainted with all the Permian strata of the British Islands

and of various parts of continental Europe, and nowhere, that I have

seen, have they suffered from metamorphic action, and strata of this age

are, I believe, as yet unknown in the Alps. This closes the list of

metamorphism of pateozoic strata.

I will not attempt (they are so numerous) to mention all the regions

of the world in which Mesozoic or Secondary formations have undergone

metamorphic action. In Britain and the non-mountainous parts of

France, they are generally quite unaltered, but in the Alps it is different.

There, as everyone knows who is familiar with that region, the crystalline

rocks in the middle of the chain have the same general strike as the

various flanking stratified formations. As expressed by Murchison, ' as

we follow the chain from N.E. to S.W. we pass from the clearest types of

sedimentary rocks, and, at length, in the Savoy Alps, are immersed in

the highly altered mountains of Secondary limestone,' while 'the meta-

morphism of the rocks is greatest as we approach the centre of the chain,'

and, indeed, any one familiar with the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy

knows that a process of metamorphism has been undergone hj all the

Jurassic roclcs (Lias and Oolites) of the great mountain chain. Whether

or not any strata of Neocomian and Cretaceous age have been well meta-

morphosed in this  region  I am unable to say but                                                                                   it seems to be  certain
                                                                                                                                 ;

that the Eocene or Lower Tertiary Alpine formation, known as the Flysch,

contains beds of black schists which pass into Lydian stone, and also that

in the Grisons it has been converted into gneiss and mica-schist, a fact

mentioned by Studer and Murchison. I also have seen in the country

north of the Oldenhorn, nummulitic rocks so far foliated that they formed

an imperfect gneiss.

In Tierra del Fuego, as described by Darwin, clay slates of early cre-

taceous date pass into gneiss and mica-slate with garnets, and in Chonos

Islands, and all along the great Cordillera of the Andes of Chili, rocks of

Cretaceous or Cretaceo-oolitic age have been metamorphosed into foliated

mica-slate and gneiss, accompanied by the presence of granite, syenite, and

greenstone.
ADDRESS.  7

    This ends my list, for I have never seen, or heard, of metamorphic

rocks of later date than those that belong to the Eocene series. Enough,
however, has been said to prove, that from the Laurentian epoch onward,
the phenomenon of extreme metamorphism of strata has been of frequent
recurrence all through Paleozoic and Mesozoic times, and extends even
to a part of the Eocene series equivalent to the soft unaltered strata of
the formations of the London and Paris basins, which excepting for their
fossil contents, and sometimes highly inclined positions, look as if they
had only been recently deposited.

                                                            Volcanoes.

     The oldest volcanic products of which I have personal knowledge are of
Lower Silurian age. These in North Wales consist of two distinct series,
the oldest of which, chiefly formed of felspathic lavas and volcanic ashes,
lie in and near the base of the Llandeilo beds, and the second, after a long
interval of repose, were ejected and intermingled with the strata forming
the middle part of the Bala beds. The Lower Silurian rocks of Mont-
gomeryshire, Shropshire, Radnorshire, Pembrokeshire, Cumberland and
Westmoreland are to a great extent also the result of volcanic eruptions,
and the same kinds of volcanic rocks occur in the Lower Silurian strata of
Ireland. I know of no true volcanic rocks in the Upper Silurian series.

     In the old Red Sandstone of Scotland lavas and volcanic ashes are of

frequent occurrence, interstratified with the ordinary lacustrine sedimen-

tary strata. Volcanic rocks are also intercalated among the Devonian
strata of Devonshire. I know of none in America or on the Continent of

Europe.

     In Scotland volcanic products are common throughout nearly the

whole of the Carboniferous sub- formations, and they are found also asso-
ciated with Permian strata.

     I now come to the Mesozoic or Secondary epochs. Of Jurassic age

(Lias and Oolites), it is stated by Lyell with some doubt, that true
volcanic products occur in the Morea and also in the Apennines, and it
seems probable, as stated by Medlicott and Blanford, that the Rajmahal

traps may also be of Jurassic age.

     In the Cordillera of South America, Darwin has described a great
series of volcanic rocks intercalated among the Cretaceo-oolitic strata
that forms go much of the chain ; and the same author in his ' Geological
Observations in South America,' states that the Cordillera has been,
probably with some quiescent periods, a source of volcanic matter from
an epoch anterior to his Cretaceo-oolitic formation to the present day.
In the Deccan volcanic traps rest on Cretaceous beds, and are overlaid
by Nummulitic strata, and according to Medlicott and Blanford, these
were poured out in the interval between Middle Cretaceous and Lower
Eocene times.

    In Europe the only instance I know of a volcano of Eocene age is
8 EEPORT-- 1880.

that of Monte Bolca near Verona, where the volcanic products are asso-

ciated with the fissile limestone of that area.

     The well-preserved relics of Miocene volcanoes are prevalent over many-
parts of Europe, such as Auvergne and The Velay, where the volcanic
action began in Lower Miocene times, and was continued into the Pliocene
epoch. The volcanoes of the Eifel are also of the same general age,
together with the ancient Miocene volcanoes of Hungary.

     The volcanic rocks of the Azores, Canaries, and Madeira are of
Miocene age, while in Tuscany there are extinct volcanoes that began in
late Miocene, and lasted into times contemporaneous with the English

Coralline Crag. In the north of Spain also, at Olot in Catalonia, there are
perfect craters and cones remaining of volcanoes that began to act in
newer Pliocene times and continued in action to a later geological date.

To these I must add the great coulees of Miocene lava, so well known in

the Inner Hebrides, on the mainland near Oban, &c., in Antrim in the
north of Ireland, in the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Franz-Joseph
Land. It is needless, and would be tiresome, farther to multiply instances,
for enough has been said to show that in nearly all geological ages

volcanoes have played an important part, now in one region, now in another,
from very early Palaeozoic times down to the present day ; and, as far as

my knowledge extends, at no period of geological history is there any sign

of their having played a more important part than they do in the epoch

in which we live.

                                            Mountain Chains.

     The mountain- chains of the world are of different geological ages,
some of them of great antiquity, and some of them comparatively
modern.

     It is well known that in North America the Lower Silurian rocks lie
uncomformably on the Laurentian strata, and also that the latter had
undergone a thorough metamorphism and been thrown into great anti-

clinal and synclinal folds, accompanied by intense minor convolutions,
before the deposition of the oldest Silurian formation, that of the Potsdam
Sandstone. Disturbances of the nature alluded to imply beyond a doubt
that the Laurentian rocks formed a mountain chain of pre- Silurian date,
which has since constantly been worn away and degraded by sub-aerial

denudation.

      In Shropshire, and in parts of North Wales, and in Cumberland and
"Westmoreland, the Lower Silurian rocks by upheaval formed hilly land
before the beginnmg of the Upper Silurian epoch ; and it is probable that
the Lower Silurian gneiss of Scotland formed mountains at the same

time, probably very much higher than now. However that may be, it is

certain, that these mountains formed high land before and during the
deposition of the Old Red Sandstone, and the upheaval of the great

Scandinavian chain (of which the Highlands may be said to form an out-
ADDRESS.  9

lying portion) also preceded the deposition of the Old Red Strata. In
 both of these mountain regions the rocks have since undergone consider-
able movements, which in the main seem to have been movements of
elevation, accompanied undoubtedly by that constant atmospheric degra-

dation to which all high land is especially subject.
      The next great European chain in point of age is that of the Ural,

which according to Murchison is of pre-Permian age, a fact proved by
the Permian conglomerates which were formed from the waste of the

older strata. On these they lie quite unconforraably and nearly undis-

turbed on the western flank of the mountains.
      In North America the great chain of the Alleghany Mountains under-

went several disturbances, the last (a great one) having taken place after

the deposition of the Carboniferous rocks, and before that of the New

Red Sandstone. The vast mountainous region included under the name
of the Rocky Mountains, after several successive disturbances of upheaval,

did not attain its present development till after the Miocene or Middle

Tertiary epoch.

     In South America, notwithstanding many oscillations of level recorded

by Darwin, the main great disturbance of the strata that form the chain
of the Andes took place apparently in post- cretaceous times.

     The Alps, the rudiments of which began in more ancient times,
received their gi-eatest disturbance and upheaval in post-Eocene days,
and were again raised at least 5,000 feet (I believe much more) at the
close of the Miocene epoch. The Apennines, the Pyrenees, the Carpa-
thians, and the great mountain region on the east of the Adriatic and
southward into Greece, are of the same general age, and this is also the
case in regard to the Atlas in North Africa, and the Caucasus on the
borders of Europe and Asia. In the north of India the history of the
Great Himalayan range closely coincides with that of the Aljjs, for
while the most powerful known disturbance and elevation of the range
took place after the close of the Eocene epoch, a subsequent elevation
occurred in post-Miocene times closely resembling and at least equal to
that sustained by the Alps at the same period.

     It would probably not be difficult by help of extra research to add
other cases to this notice of recurrences of the upheaval and origin of
special mountain chains, some of which I have spoken of from personal
knowledge ; but enough has been given to show the bearing of this question
on the argument I have in view, namely, that of repetition of the same
kind of events throughout all known geological time.

                                         Salt and Salt Lal-es.

    I now come to the discussion of the circumstances that produced

numerous recurrences of the development of beds of various salts (chiefly

common rock-salt) in many fonnations, which it will be seen are to a

great extent connected with continental or inland conditions. In com-
10 REPORT-- 1880.

paratively rainless countries salts are often deposited on the surface of the
ground by the effect of solar evaporation of moisture from the soil. "Water
dissolves certain salts in combination with the ingredients of the under-

lying rocks and soils, and brings it to the surface, and when solar evaporation
ensues the salt or salts are deposited on the ground. This is well known
to be the case in and near the region of the Great Salt Lake in North
America, and in South America in some of the nearly rainless districts of

the Cordillera, extensive surface- deposits of salts of various kinds are

common. The surface of the ground around the Dead Sea is also in extra
dry seasons covered with salt, the result of evaporation, and in the upper
provinces of India (mentioned by Medlicott and Blanford) ' many tracts

of land in the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain are rendered worthless for cul-

tivation by an efflorescence of salt known in the North-West Provinces as
Reh,^ while every geographer knows that in Central Asia, from the western

shore of the Caspian Sea to the Kinshan Mountains of Mongolia, with
rare exceptions nearly every lake is salt in an area at least 3,500 miles in
length. This circumstance is due to the fact that all so-called fresh-water
springs, and therefore all rivers, contain small quantities of salts in solu-
tion only appreciable to the chemist, and by the constant evaporation of
pure water from the lakes, in the course of time, it necessarily happens
that these salts get concentrated in the water by the effect of solar heat,
and, if not already begun, precipitation of solid salts must ensue.

     The earliest deposits of rock-salt that I know about have been described
by Mr. A. B. Wynne of the Geological Survey of India, in his Memoir ' On
the Geology of the Salt Range in the Punjab.' ' The beds of salt are of great
thickness, and along with gypsum and dolomitic layers occur in marl of a
red colour like our Keuper Marl. This colour I have for many years con-

sidered to be, in certain cases, apt to indicate deposition of sediments in

inland lakes, salt or fresh, as the case may be, and with respect to these

strata in the Punjab Salt Range, authors seem to be in doubt whether
they were formed in inland lakes or in lagoons near the seaboard, which
at intervals were liable to be flooded by the sea, and in which in the hot

myseasons salts were deposited by evaporation caused by solar heat. For

argument, it matters but little which of these was^the true physical con-
dition of the land of the time, though I incline to think the inland lake
theory most probable. The age of the strata associated with this salt is
not yet certainly ascertained. In ' The Geology of India ' MedHcott
and Blanford incline to consider them of Lower Silurian age, and Mr.
Wynne, in his ' Geology of the Salt Range,' places the salt and gypsum
beds doubtfully on the same geological horizon.

     The next salt-bearing formation that I shall notice is the Salina or
Onondaga Salt Group of North America, which forms part of the Upper
Silurian rocks, and hes immediately above the Niagara Limestone. It is
rich in gypsum and in salt-brine, often of a very concentrated character,

    * Many earlier notices and descriptions of the Salt Range might be quoted, but

* which can only be derived from original depositions of salt,' and it is

also supposed by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt to contain solid rock-salt 115 feet in
thickness at the depth of 2,085 feet, near Saginaw Bay in Michigan.

     In the Lower Devonian strata of Russia near Lake Ilmen, Sir R.
Murchison describes salt springs at Starai Russa. Sinkings ' made in
the hope of penetrating to the source of these salt springs,' reached a
depth of 600 feet without the discovery of rock salt, ' and we are left in
doubt whether the real source of the salt is in the lowest beds of the

Devonian rocks or even in the Silurian system.'
     In the United States brine springs also occur in Ohio, Pennsylvania,

and Virginia, in Devonian rocks.

    In Michigan salts are found from the Carboniferous down to the
Devonian series; and in other parts of the United States, Western
Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky, from the lower
Coal-measures salts are derived which must have been deposited in inland

areas, since even in the depths of inland seas that communicate with the

great ocean, such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, no great beds

of salt can be deposited. Before such strata of salt can be formed, super-

saturation must have taken place.
     In the North of England at and near Middlesbrough two deep bore-

holes were made some years ago in the hope of reaching the Coal-measures
of the Durham coal-field. One of them at Salthome was sunk to a depth
of 1,355 feet. First they passed through 74 feet of superficial clay and
gravel, next through about 1,175 feet of red sandstones and marls, with
beds of rock-salt and gypsum. The whole of these strata (excepting the
clay and gravel) evidently belong to the Keuper marls and sandstones of

the upper part of our New Red series. Beneath these they passed through

67 feet of dolomitic limestone, which in this neighbourhood forms the
upper part of the Permian series, and beneath the limestone the strata
consist of 27 feet of gypsum and rock-salt and marls, one of the beds of
rock-salt having a thickness of 14 feet. This bed of Permian salt is
of some importance, since I have been convinced for long that the
British Permian strata were deposited, not in the sea, but in salt lakes
comparable in some respects to the great salt lake of Utah, and in its
restricted fauna to the far greater salt lake of the Caspian Sea. The
gypsum, the dolomite or magnesian limestone, the red marls covered with
rain-pittings, the sun-cracks, and the impressions of footprints of reptiles

made in the soft sandy marls when the water was temporarily lowered by

the solar evaporation of successive summers, all point to the fact that our
Permian strata were not deposited in the sea, but in a salt lake or lakes

once for a time connected with the sea. The same may be said of other

Permian areas in the central parts of the Continent of Europe, such as
Stassfurt and Anhalt, Halle and Altern in Thuringia, and Sperenberg,

near Berlin, and also in India.

question is treated in more detail.

     Neither do I tliink that the Permian strata of Russia, as de-
scribed by Sir Roderick Murchison, were necessarily, as he implies,
deposited in a wide ocean. According to his view all marine life

universally declined to a minimum after the close of the Carboniferous

period, that decline beginning with the Permian and ending with the

Triassic epoch. Those who believe in the doctrine of evolution will find

it hard to accept the idea which this implies, namely, that all the prolific
forms of the Jurassic series sprang from the scanty faunas of the Permian

and Triassic epochs. On the contrary, it seems to me more rational to

attribute the poverty of the faunas of these epochs to accidental abnormal
conditions in certain areas, that for a time partially disappeared during
the deposition of the continental Muschelkalk which is absent in the

British Triassic series.

     In the whole of the Russian Permian strata only fifty-three species
were known at the time of the publication of ' Russia and the Ural
Mountains,' and I have not heard that this scanty list has been subse-

quently increased. I am therefore inclined to believe that these red marls,

grits, sandstones, conglomerates, and great masses of gypsum and rock-
salt were all formed in a flat inland area which was occasionally liable to
be invaded by the sea during intermittent intervals of minor depression,

sonaetimes in one area, sometimes in another, and the fauna small in size
and poor in numbers is one of the results, while the deposition of beds of

salt and gypsum is another. If so, then in the area now called Russia, in

sheets of inland Permian water, deposits were formed strictly analogous
to those of Central Europe and of Britain, but on a larger scale.

      Other deposits of salt deep beneath overlying younger strata are stated

to occur at Bromberg in Prussia, and many more might be named as

lying in the same formation in northern Germany.
     If we now turn to the Triassic series it is known that it consists of

only two chief members in Britain, the Bunter Sandstones and the Keuper

or New Red Marls, the Muschelkalk of the Continent being absent in our
islands. No salt is found in the Bunter sandstones of England, but it

occurs in these strata at Schoningeu in Brunswick and also near Hanover.

In the lower part of the Keuper series deposits of rock-salt are common in
England and Ireland. At Almersleben, near Calbe, rock-salt is found in

the Muschelkalk, and also at Erfurt and Slottenheim in Thuringia and at

Wilhelmsgliick in Wurtemburg. In other Triassic areas it is known
at Honigsen, in Hanover, in middle Keuper beds. In the red shales at
Sperenberg and Lieth on the Lower Elbe, salt was found at the depth of

3,000 feet, and at Stassfnrth the salt is said to be ' several hundred yards

thick.'

      In Central Spain rock-salt is known, and at Tarragona, Taen, and also
at Santander in the north of Spain, all in Triassic strata. Other locali-

ties may be named in the Upper Trias, such as the Salzkammergut,

Aussee, Hallstatt, Ischl, Hallein in Salzburg, Halle in the Tyrol, and
Berchesgaden in Bavaria.
ADDRESS.  13

     In the Salt Range of mountains in Northern India saliferous strata
are referred with some doubt by Medlicott and Blanford to the Triassic

strata.

     In the Jurassic series (Lias and Oolites) salt and gypsum are not
uncommon. One well-known instance occurs at Berg in the valley of the
Rhone in Switzerland, where salt is derived from the Lias. Salt and
gypsum are also found in Jurassic rocks at Burgos in Spain. At Gap in
France there is gypsum, and salt is found in the Austrian Alps in Oolitic

limestone.

     In the Cretaceous rocks salt occurs, according to Lartet, at Jebel

Usdom by the Dead Sea, and other authorities state that it occurs in the

Pyrenees and at Biskra in Africa, where ' mountains of salt ' are mentioned
as of Cretaceous age. The two last-named localities are possibly uncertain :
but whether or not this is the case, it is not the less certain that salt has
been deposited in Cretaceous rocks, and, judging by analogy, pi'obably in

inland areas of that epoch.

     In the Eocene or Older Tertiary formations, rock-salt is found at
Cardona in Spain, and at Kohat in the Punjab it occurs at the base of

Nummulitic beds. It is also known at Mandi in India in strata supposed
to be of Nummulitic Eocene age.

     The record does not end hei'e, for a zone of rock- salt lies in Sicily at
the top of the Salina clays in Lower Miocene beds, and in Miocene
strata gypsum is found at several places in Spain, while salt also occurs
in beds that are doubtfully of Miocene age (but may be later) at Wie-
litzka in Poland, Kalusz in Galicia, Bukowina, and also in Transylvania.

     In Pliocene or Later Tertiary formations, thick beds of gypsum are
known in Zante, and strata of salt occur in Roumania and Galicia, whil©

in Pliocene rocks, according to Dana, or in Post-Tertiary beds, according
to others, a thick bed of pui'e salt was penetrated to a depth of 38 feet at

Petit Anse in Louisiana. This ends my list, though I have no doubt

that, by further research, many more localities might be given. Enough,
however, has been done to show that rock-salt (and other salts) are of

frequent recurrence throughout all geological time, and as in my opinion

it is impossible that common salt can be deposited in the open ocean, it

follows that this and other salts must have been precipitated from solu-
tions, which, by the effect of solar evaporation became at length super-
saturated, like those of the Dead Sea, the great salt lake of Utah, and in
other places which it is superfluous to name.

                              Fresh-water. LaJces and Estuaries.

    I now come to the subject of recurrences of fresh-water conditions both

in lakes and estuaries. In the introduction to the ' Geology of India ' by
Messrs. Medlicott and Blanford, mention is made of the Blaini and Ki'ol
rocks as probably occupying ' hollows formed by denudation in the old
gneissic rocks,' and the inference is drawn that 'if this be a correct view,
14 KEPORT--1880.

it is probable that the cis-Himalayan palaeozoic rocks are in great part of
fresb- water origin, and that the present crystalline axis of the Western

Himalayas approximately coincides with the shore of the ancient palseozoic

continent, of which the Indian peninsula formed a portion.' The Ea-ol

rocks are classed broadly with ' Permian and Carboniferous ' deposits,
but the Blaini beds are doubtfully considered to belong to Upper Silurian

strata. If this point be by-and-by established, this is the earliest known

occurrence of fresh-water strata in any of the more ancient palseozoic

formations.

     It is a fact worthy of notice that the colour of the strata formed in old
lakes (whether fresh or salt) of pateozoic and mesozoic ago is apt to be

red : a circumstance due to the fact that each little grain of sand or mud

is usually coated with a very thin pellicle of peroxide of iron. Whether
or not the red and purple Cambrian rocks ' may not be partly of fresh-

water origin, is a question that I think no one but myself has raised.^

myThere is, however, in  opinion, no doubt with regard to the fresh-

water origin of the Old Red Sandstone, as distinct from the contem-

poraneous marine deposits of the Devonian strata. This idea was first

started by that distinguished geologist. Doctor Fleming, of Edinburgh,
followed by Mr. Godwin-Austen, who, from the absence of marine shells

and the nature of the fossil fishes in these strata, inferred that they

were deposited, not in the sea, as had always been asserted, but in a great

fresh-water lake or in a series of lakes. In this opinion I have for many

years agreed, for the nearest analogies of the fish are, according to Huxley,

the Polypterus of African rivers, the Ceratodus of Australia, and in less

degTce the Lepidosteus of North America. The truth of the supposition

that the Old Red Sandstone was deposited in fresh water, is further borne

out by the occurrence of a fresh-water shell, Anodonta JuJcesii, and of ferns
in the Upper Old Red Sandstone in Ireland ; and the same shell is found

at Dura Den in Scotland, while in Caithness, along with numerous fishes,

there occurs the small bivalve crustacean Estheria Murchisonise.

     I think it more than probable that the red series of rocks that form the

Catskill Mountains of North America, (and with which I am personally

acquainted) were formed in the same manner as the Old Red Sandstones

of Britain ; for excepting in one or two minor interstratifications, they

contain no relics of marine life, while 'the fossil fishes of the Catskill

beds, according to Dr. Newberry, appear to represent closely those of the

British Old Red Sandstone.' (Dana.)

The Devonian rocks of Russia, according to the late Sir Roderick

Murchison, consist of two distinct types, viz, Devonian strata identical in

general character with those in Devonshire and in various parts of the

    ^ By Cambrian, I mean only the 7'ed and purple rocks of Wales, England, Scot-
land, and Ireland, older than the Menevian beds, or any later division of the Silurian
strata, that may chance to rest upon them.

1871, vol. 28.
ADDRESS.  15

continent of Europe. These are exclusively of a marine character, wliile

the remainder corresponds to the Old Red Sandstone of Wales, England,

and Scotland.
     At Tchudora, about 105 miles S.E. of St. Petersburg, the lowest

members of the series consist of flag-like compact limestones accumulated

in a tranquil sea and containing fucoids and encrinites, together mth

shells of Devonian age, such as Spirifers, Terebratulce, Orthis, Lepteenas,
Avicula, Modiola, Natica, Bellerophon, &c., while the upper division

gi'aduates into the Carboniferous series as it often does in Britain, and, like

the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland, contains only fish-remains, and in

both countries they are of the same species. ' Proceeding from the
Valdai Hills on the north,' the geologist ' quits a Devonian Zone with a
true " Old Bed" type dipping under the Carboniferous rocks of Moscow,
and having passed through the latter, he finds himself suddenly in a
yellow-coloured region, entirely dissimilar in structure to what he had
seen in any of the northern governments, which, of a different type as
regards fossils, is the true stratigraphical equivalent of the Old Bed system.'
This seems to me, as regards the Russian strata, to mean, that just as the
Devonian strata of Devonshire are the true equivalents of the Old Red
Sandstone of Wales and Scotland, they were deposited under very different
conditions, the first in the sea and the others in inland fresh-water lakes.
At the time Sir Roderick Murchison's work was completed, the 'almost

universal opinion was that the Old Red Sandstone was a marine forma-

tion. In the year 1830, the Rev. Dr. Fleming, of Edinburgh, read a
paper before the Wernerian Society in which he boldly stated that the
' Old Bed Sandstone is a fresh-water formation ' of older date than the

Carboniferous Limestone. This statement, however, seems to have made
no impression on geologists till it was revived by Godwin-Austen in
a memoir ' On the Extension of the Coal-measures,' &c., in the Journal
of the Geological Society, 1856. Even this made no converts to what
was then considered a heretical opinion. I have long held Dr, Fleming's
view, and unfortunately published it in the third edition of ' The Physical
Geology and Geography of Great Britain,' without at the time being
aware that I had been forestalled by Dr. Fleming and Mr. Godwin-

Austen.

    To give anything like a detailed account of all the fresh-water forma-
tions deposited in estuaries and lakes from the close of the Old Red
Sandstone times down to late Tertiary epochs, is only fitted for a manual
of geology, and would too much expand this address ; and I will therefore
give little more than a catalogue of these deposits in ascending order.

      In the Coal-measure parts of the Carboniferous series, a great propor-
tion of the shales and sandstones are of fresh-water origin. This is proved
all over the British Islands by the shells they contain, while here and there
marine interstratifi cations occur, generally of no great thickness. There

is no doubt among geologists that these Coal-measure strata were chiefly
--16 EEPOKT 1880.

  deposited under estnarine conditions, and sometimes in lagoons or in lakes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 while nnmerous beds of coal formed by the life and death of land plants,
 each underlaid by the soil on which the plants grew, evince the constant
 recurrence of terrestrial conditions. The same kind of phenomena are
 characteristic of the Coal-measures all through ISTorth America, and in
 every country on the continent of Europe, from France and Spain on the
 west, to Russia in the east, and the same is the case in China and in other

  areas.

       In Scotland, according to Prof. Judd, fresh-water conditions occur

 more or less all through the Jurassic series, from the Lias to the Upper

 Oolites. In England, fresh-water strata, with thin beds of coal, are found
 in the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire, and in the middle of England and
 elsewhere in the Great Oolite. The Purbeck and Wealden strata, which,
 in a sense, fill the interval between the Jurassic and Cretaceous series, are
 almost entirely formed of fresh-water strata, with occasional thin marine

 interstratifications. By some the Wealden beds are considered to have

 been formed in and near the estuary of a great river, while others, with
 as good a show of reason, believe them to have been deposited in a large

 lake subject to the occasional influx of the sea.
      In the eastern part of South Eussia the Lias consists chiefly of fresh,

 water strata, as stated by Neumayr.
     The Godwana rocks of Central India range from Upper Palasozoic

 times well into the Jurassic strata, and there all these formations are of
fresh-water origin. Fresh-water beds with shells are also interstratified
with the Deccan traps of Cretaceous and Tertiary (Eocene) age, while
 2,000 feet of fresh-water sands overlie them.

     In South-western Sweden, as stated by Mr. Bauerman, 'the three
coal-fields of Hoganas, Stabbarp, and Rodinge, lie in the uppermost
Triassic or Rhsetic series.' In Africa, the Karoo beds, which it is surmised

may be of the age of the New Red Sandstone, contain beds of coal. In

North America, certain fresh-water strata, with beds of lignite, apparently
belong to the Cretaceous and Eocene epochs, and in the north of Spain
and south of France, there are fresh-water lacustrine formations in the

highest Cretaceous strata.

     In England the lower and upper Eocene strata are chiefly of fi-esh-
water origin, and the same is the case in France and other parts of the
Contiuent. Certain fresh-water formations in Central Spain extend from
the Eocene to the upper Miocene strata.

     There is only one small patch of Miocene beds in England, at Bovey
Tracey, near Dartmoor, formed of fresh- water deposits with interstratified

beds of lignite or Miocene coal. On the continent of Europe, Miocene

strata occupy immense independent areas, extending from France and
Spain to the Black Sea. In places too numerous to name, they contain
beds of ' brown coal,' as lignite is sometimes called. These coal-beds

are often of great thickness and solidity. In one of the pits which I
descended near Teplitz, in Bohemia, the coal, which lies in a true basin,
       ADDRESS.                                  17

is 40 feet thick, and underneatli it there is a bed of clay, with rootlets,
quite comparable to the underclay which is found beneath almost every
bed of coal in the British and other coal-fields of the Carboniferous epoch.

The Miocene rocks of Switzerland are familiar to all geologists, who have

traversed the country between the Jura and the Alps. Sometimes they
are soft and incoherent, sometimes formed of sandstones, and some-
times of conglomerates, as on the Righi. They chiefly consist of fresh-
water lacustrine strata, with some minor marine interstratifications which

mark the influx of the sea during occasional partial submergences of

portions of the area. These fresh- water strata, of great extent and thick-
ness, contain beds of lignite, and are remarkable for the relics of numerous
trees and other plants which have been described by Prof. Heer of
Zui'ich, with his accustomed skill. The Miocene fresh-water strata, of the

Sewalik Hills in India are well known to most students of geology, and I
have already stated that they bear the same relation to the more ancient
Himalayan mountains that the Miocene strata of Switzerland and the
North of Italy do to the pre-existing range of the Alps. In fact, it may be
safely inferred that something far more than the rudiments of our present
continents existed long before Miocene times, and this accounts for the
large areas on those continents which are frequently occupied by Miocene
fresh-water strata. With the marine formations of Miocene age this

address is in no way concerned, nor is it essential to my argument to deal

with those later tertiary phenomena, which in their upper stages so
easily merge into the existing state of the world.

       Olacial Phenomena.

I now come to the last special subject for discussion in this address,

viz., the Recurrence of Glacial Epochs, a subject still considered by some

to be heretical, and which was generally looked upon as an absurd crotchet

when, in 1855, I first described to the Geological Society, boulder-beds,

containing ice-scratched stones, and en-atic blocks in the Permian strata

of England. The same idea I afterwards applied to some of the Old
Red Sandstone conglomerates, and of late years it has become so familiar,

that the effects of glaciers have at length been noted by geologists from

older Palaezoic epochs down to the present day.

In the middle of last July I received a letter from Prof. Geikie, in

which he informed me that he had discovered mammilated moutonnee

surfaces of Laurentian rocks, passing underneath the Cambrian sand-

stones of the north-west of Scotland at intervals, all the way from Cape
Wrath to Loch Torridon, for a distance of about 90 miles. The mammi-

lated rocks are, says Prof Geikie, ' as well rounded off as any recent roclie
moutonnee,' and, ' in one place these bosses are covered by'a huge angular

breccia of this old gneiss (Laurentian) with blocks sometimes five or six

feet long.' This breccia, where it occurs, forms the base of the Cambrian

strata of Sutherland, Ross, and Cromarty, and while the higher strata are

1880.  c
18 EEPOET-- 1880.

always well stratified, where they approach the underlying Laurentian
gneiss ' they become pebbly, passing into coarse unstratified agglomerates
or bonlder-beds.' In the Gairloch district ' it is utterly nnstratified, the
angular fragments standing on end and at all angles,' just as they do in

many modern moraine mounds wherever large glaciers are found. The

general subject of Paleozoic glaciers has long been familiar to me, and this
account of more ancient glaciers of Cambrian age is peculiarly acceptable.

     The next sisn of ice in Britain is found in the lower Silurian rocks of
Wigtonshire and Ayrshire. In the year 1865 Mr. John CaiTick Moore

took me to see the Lower Silurian graptolitic rocks at Corswall Point in

Wigtonshire, in which great blocks of gneiss, granite, &c., are imbedded,

and in the same year many similar erratic blocks were pointed out to me

by Mr. James Geikie in the Silurian strata of Carrick in Ayrshire. One of
the blocks at Corswall, as measured by myself, is nine feet in length, and
the rest are of all sizes, from an inch or two up to several feet in diameter.
There is no gneiss or granite in this region nearer than those of Kirkcud-
brightshire and Arran, and these are of later geological date than the strata
amid which the erratic hlocJcs are ivibedded. It is therefore not improbable

that they may have been derived from some high land formed of Lauren-

tian rocks of which the outer Hebrides and parts of the mainland of
Scotland form surviving portions. If so, then I can conceive of no agent
capable of transporting large boulders and dropping them into the Lower

Silurian mud of the seas of the time save that of icebergs or other float-

ing ice, and the same view with regard to the neighbouring boulder-beds
of Ayrshire is held by Mr. James Geikie. If, however, any one will point
out any other natural cause still in action by which such results are at
present brought about, I should be very glad to hear of it.

    I must now turn to India for further evidence of the action of palaeo-

zoic ice. In the Himalayas of Pangi, S.E. of Kashmir, according to
Medlicott and Blanford, ' old slates, supposed to be Silurian, contain
boulders in great numbers,' which they believe to be of glacial origin.

Another case is mentioned as occurring in ' transition beds of unknown

relations,' but in another passage they are stated to be ' very ancient, but
no idea can be formed of their geological position.' The underlying rocJcs
are marlced hy distinct glacial striations.

    The next case of glacial boulder-beds with which I am acquainted is

found in Old Red Sandstone in Scotland, and in some places in the north
of England, where they contain what seem to be indistinctly ice-scratched
stones. I first observed these rocks on the Lammermuir Hills, south of
Dunbar, lying unconformably on Lower Silurian strata, and soon inferred
them to be of glacial origin, a circumstance that was subsequently con-

firmed by my colleagues. Prof, and Mr. James Geikie, and is now familiar

to other officers of the Geological Survey of Scotland.

     I know of no boulder formations in the Carboniferous series, but they
are well known as occurring on a large scale in the Permian brecciated

conglomerates, where they consist ' of pebbles and large blocks of stone,
                                                                  ADDRESS.                                    19

generally angular, imbedded in a marly paste. . , . tbe fragments

have mostly travelled from a distance, apparently from the borders of

Wales, and some of them are three feet in diameter.' Some of the stones

are aa well scratched as those found in modern moraines or in the ordinary

boulder-clay of what is commonly called the Glacial Epoch. In 1865

the old idea was still not unprevalent that daring the Permian Epoch,
and for long after, the globe had not yet cooled sufficiently to allow of the

climates of the external world being universally affected by the constant

radiation of heat from its interior. For a long time, however, this idea

has almost entirely vanished, and now, in Britain at all events, it is.

little if at all attended to, and other glacial episodes in the history of

the world have continued to be brought forward and are no longer looked
upon as mere ill-judged conjectures.

     The same kind of brecciated boulder-beds that are found in our Per-
mian strata occur in the Eotheliegende of Germany, which I have visited

in several places, and I believe them to have had a like glacial origin.

Ml'. G. W. Stow, of the Orange Free State, has of late years given

most elaborate accounts of similar Permian boulder-beds in South Africa.

There, great masses of moraine matter not only contain ice-scratched

stones, but on the banks of rivers where the Permian rock has been re-
moved by aqueous denudation, the underlying rocks, well rounded and

mammillated, are covered hj deeply incised glacier grooves pointing in a

direction which at length leads the observer to the pre-Permian mountains

from whence the stones were derived that formed these ancient moraines, i

Messrs. Blanford and MedUcott have also given in ' The Geology of

India                            an  account  of  boulder-beds    in        what       they  believe  to  be  Permian

                              '

strata, and which they compare with those described by me in England
many years before. There the Godwana group of the Talchir strata con-

tains numerous boulders, many of them six feet in diameter, and 'in one

mstance some of the hlocTcs were found to he polished and striated, and the

underlying Vindhyan rocks were similarly marhed. The authors also cor-

relate these glacial phenomena with those found in similar deposits in
South Africa, discovered and described by Mr. Stow.

lu the Obve group of the Salt range, described by the same authors,

there is a curious resemblance between a certain conglomerate 'and that
of the Talchir group of the Godwana system.' This ' Olive conglomerate '

belongs to the Cretaceous series, and contains ice-transported erratic

boulders derived from unknown rocks, one of which of red granite ' is

polished and striated on three faces in so characteristic a manner that
very little doubt can exist of its having been transported by ice.' One
mblock of red granite at the Mayo Salt Mines of Khewra 'is 7 feet high
and 19 feet                          circumference.' In the ' Transition beds ' of the same

 authors, wliicli are supposed to be of Upper Cretaceous age, there also are

  boulder beds with erratic blocks of great size.

      I know of no evidence of glacial phenomena in Eocene strata except-
 ing the occurrence of huge masses of included gneiss in the strata known
 as Flysch in Switzerland. On this question, however, Swiss geologists
 are by no means agreed, and I attach little or no importance to it as

  affording evidence of glacier ice.

      Neither do I know of any Miocene glacier-deposits excepting those in
 the north of Italy near Turin, described by the late eminent geologist,
 Gastaldi, and which I saw under his guidance. These contain many large

 erratic boulders derived from the distant Alps, which, in my opinion,

 were then at least as lofty or even higher than they are now, especially if

 we consider the immense amount of denudation which they underwent

 during Miocene, later Tertiary, and post-tertiary times.
      At a still later date there took place in the north of Europe and

 America what is usually misnamed ' The Glacial Epoch,' when a vast
 glacial mass covered all Scandinavia, and distributed its boulders across
 the north of Germany, as far south as the country around Leipzig, when
Ireland also was shrouded in glacier ice, and when a great glacier covered
 the larger part of Britain, and stretched southward, perhaps nearly as
far as the Thames on the one side, and certainly covered the whole of
Anglesey, and probably the whole, or nearly the whole, of South Wales.
 This was after the advent of man.

      Lastly, there is still a minor Glacial Epoch in progress on the large
·and almost unknown Antarctic continent, from the high land of which in
latitudes which partly lie as far north as 60° and 62°, a vast sheet of
glacier-ice of great thickness extends far out to sea and sends fleets of
icebergs to the north, there to melt in warmer latitudes. If in accordance
 with the theory of Mr. Croll, founded on astronomical data, a similar
climate were transferred to the northern hemisphere, the whole of Scan-
dinavia and the Baltic would apparently be covered with glacier-ice, and
the same would probably be the case with the Faroe Islands and great
part of Siberia, while even the mountain tracts of Britain might again
maintain their minor systems of glaciers.

                                                             Conclusions.

      In opening this address, I began with the subject of the oldest meta-

--morphic rocks that I have seen the Laurentian strata. It is evident to

every person who thinks on the subject that their deposition took place
far from the beginning of recognised geological time. For there must have
been older rocks by the degradation of which they were formed. And if,

as some American geologists afiirm, there are on that continent meta-
morphic rocks of more ancient dates than the Laurentian strata, there
must have been rocks more ancient still to afford materials for the de-

position of these pre-Laurentian strata.
             1

ADDRESS.  2

          Starting witli tlie Laurentian rocks, I liave shown tliat the phe-
     nomena of metamorphism of strata have been continued from that date
     all through the later formations, or groups of formations, down to and
     including part of the Eocene strata in some parts of the world.

          In like manner I have shown that ordinary volcanic rocks have been

      ejected in Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceo-oolitic,
      Cretaceous, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene times, and from all that I
      have seen or read of these ancient volcanoes, I have no reason to believe
     that volcanic forces played a more important part in any period of geo-

     logical time than they do in this our modern epoch.
           So, also, mountain chains existed before the deposition of the Silurian

     rocks, others of later date before the Old Red Sandstone strata were

     formed, and the chain of the Ural before the deposition of the Permian
     beds. The last great upheaval of the Alleghany Mountains took place
     between the close of the formation of the Carboniferous strata of that

I region and the deposition of the New Red Sandstone.

           According to Darwin, after various oscillations of level, the Cordillera
     underwent its chief upheaval after the Cretaceous epoch, and all geologists

     know that the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Carpathians, the Himalayas, and
     other mountain-chains (which I have named) underwent what seems to

     have been their chief gi'eat upheaval after the deposition of the Eocene
     strata, while some of them were again lifted up several thousands of

     feet after the close of the Miocene epoch.
          The deposition of salts from aqueous solutions in inland lakes and

   --lagoons appears to have taken place through all time through Silurian,

      Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene,

   --Miocene, and Pliocene epochs and it is going on now.

         In like manner fresh- water and estuarine conditions are found now in
     one region, now in another, throughout all the formations or groups of

     formations possibly from Silurian times onward ; and glacial phenomena,
     so far from being confined to what was and is generally still termed the
     Glacial Epoch, are now boldly declared, by independent witnesses of
     known high reputation, to begin with the Cambrian epoch, and to have
     occurred somewhere, at intervals, in various formations, from almost the
     earliest Pateozoic times down to our last post-Pliocene ' Glacial Epoch.'

         If the nebalar hypothesis of astronomers be true (and I know of no
    reason why it should be doubted), the earth was at one time in a purely

I gaseous state, and afterwards in a fluid condition, attended by intense
     heat. By-and-by consolidatioD, due to partial cooling, took place on the

     surface, and as radiation of heat went on, the outer shell thickened.

      Radiation still going on, the interior fluid matter decreased in bulk, and,

     by force of gravitation, the outer shell being drawn towards the interior,

     gave way, and, in parts, got crinkled up, and this, according to cos-
     mogonists, was the origin of the earliest mountain-chains. I make no

      objection to the hypothesis, which, to say the least, seems to be the best
     that can be offered and looks highly probable. But, assuming that
22 EEPORT-- 1880.

it is true, these hypothetical events took place so long before authentic
geological history began, as written in the rocks, that the earliest of the

physical events to which I have drawn your attention in this address
was, to all human apprehension of time, so enormously removed from these
early assumed cosmical phenomena, that they appear to tne to have been
of comparatively quite modern occurrence, and to indicate that from the
Laurentian epoch down to the present day, all the physical events in the
history of the earth have vaned neither in kind nor in intensity from those of
which we now have experience. Perhaps many of our British geologists
hold similar opinions, but, if it be so, it may not be altogether useless
to have considered the various subjects separately on which I depend
to prove the point I had in view.

        STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report of the Comtnittee, consisting of Professor Sir William
     Thomson, Professor Tait, Professor Grant, Dr. Siemens, Pro-
    fessor Purser, Professor G. Forbes, Mr. Horace Darwin, and
     Mr. Gr. H. Darwin {Secretary'), appointed for the Measureonent
     of the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity.

The Committee beg leave to report as follows :
    The sum of £30 granted in 1879 for the purposes of the Committee

has been paid to Mr. G. H. Darwin.
     Before the meeting of 1879 Mr. G. H. Darwin and Mr. Horace Darwin

were making prepo-rations for carrying out experiments with a view of
detecting sm.all variations in the directions of the force of gravity. With
the aid of the above grant some preliminary experiments have been made
during the past year by Mr. G. H. and Mr. H. Darwin in the Cavendish
Laboratory of the University of Cambridge by means of an instrument of
which the jjrinciple was suggested to the experimenters by Sir William
Thomson.

     The experiments have not as yet been carried sufi&ciently far to make

it desirable to present a detailed report to the British Association. It

may nevertheless be mentioned that results of some interest have been

attained with regard to the warping of stone columns under the influence
of minute changes of temperature or of small stresses.

     The chief conclusion, however, to which the experimenters have been
led is that it is now necessary to entirely re-design the apparatus. It seems
probable that the experiments will occupy a considerable time, and may

possibly prove expensive.

     Under these circumstances the Committee think it expedient to defer
the presentation of their Report and of the accounts until the meeting of

the Association in 1881.

                                           Supplementary Report.

     The Secretary of this Committee having got in and paid an outstanding
account since the Report was sent in, finds that nearly the whole sum
granted for the purposes of the Committee in 1879 has been expended.
26 heport--1880.

     As, however, the experiments are still only in an incipient stage, it is

necessary to defer the report of the results attained.

     Under these circumstances the Secretary sus^gests the advisability of
the continuation of the Committee on the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity for

another year.

     As the plan which the experimenters intend to pursue will involve some

--masonry work and the use of a good deal of copper for apparatus an
--expensive material and difficult to work it seems likely that future

operations may prove expensive. The Secretary, therefore, ventures to
suggest that the Association should grant a further sum of 30/. for the

purposes of this Committee.

Thirteenth Report of the GomxiinUtee, consisting o/ Professor Everett,
   Professor Sir William Thomson, Mr. Gr. J. Symons, Professor
   Eamsay, Professor GtEIKIE, Mr. J. GtLAISHER, Mr. Pengelly,

   Professor Edward Hull, Dr. Clement Le Neve Foster, Professor
   A. S. Herschel, Professor Gr. A. Lebour, Mr. A. B. Wynne,
   Mr. Gtalloway, Mr. Joseph Dickinson, Mr. Gr. F. Deacon, and
   Mr. E. Wethered, appointed for the purpose of investigating
   the Rate of Increase of Underground Temperature dowmvards

   in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water. Drawn
   up by Professor Everett {^Secretary).

Observations have been taken in the Talargoch Lead Mine, Flintshire
(between Rhyl and Prestatyn), under the direction of Mr. A. Strahan, of
the Geological Survey, and Mr. Walker, Chairman of the Board of Direc-

tors of the mine.

     The top of the shaft is 190 feet above the level of the sea, and is at the
foot of a hill 500 feet above the sea. The lowest workings are 900 feet
below sea-level. The veins run across an angle of Carboniferous Lime-
stone, bounded on both sides by faults which throw down coal-measure
shale ; and as the faults have a considerable inclination, the lowest work-
ings run beneath the shale for a considerable distance. The limestone
dips at angles varying from 45° to 55°, and is of two kinds, one white and
massive, the other thin bedded black with thin shale partings.

     There are levels at intervals of about 20 yards vertically, in the vein,
most of which have been driven for some years ; but all the observations
have been taken in newly opened ground.

     They have been taken by boring a hole 24 inches deep at a distance of
from 1^ to 5 yards fi'om the fore breast, and either on the same day or
the next day inserting one of the Committee's slow-action thermometers,
with a foot of plugging consisting of dry rag and clay behind it. After
an interval generally of four days the thermometer was taken out and
read, then reinserted, and read again about a week later, the difference
between the two readings never amounting to so much as half a degree.

     The observations were taken at six different places in the mine, which
are designated by the observers Stations I. to VI. ; but in one instance,
that of Station II., owing to the swelling of newly exposed shale, the hole

became distorted, so that after extracting the dry rag and clay, an hour
was expended in working out the thermometer, the reading of which has
therefore been rejected. The following is a list of the five remaining

stations, arranged in order of depth :

     It will be observed that the order of the temperatures is not the same
as the order of the depths ; it therefore becomes important to describe the

positions with some particularity.
     Stations IV., V., and III. are near together in ground plan, IV. and V.

being about 250 yards apart, and III. nearly midway between them, and
they have all the same rock overhead between them and the surface,

namely, black and white limestone.
    At Station I. the rock overhead consists almost entirely of sandstones

and shales, with thin coal-seams. At Station VI. it consists of white

limestone and shale.

    It may be mentioned that the temperature at VI. was observed on three

several occasions, namely, January 14, January 21, and February 19, and

was in each case found to be the same. Mr. Strahan further states that
this station is near a large fault, which contains iron pyrites and gives off
water charged with sulphuretted hydrogen ; the temperature of the water
as pumped up "Walker's shaft from a depth of 770 feet, being 63° at the

top of the lift. It seems probable that the decomposition of this pyrites

may be the cause of the exceptionally high temperature at this station.

     The comparison of the temperatures will be most clearly brought out
by tabulating the rate of increase from the surface down to each station, as

calculated from an assumed surface temperature, which may be fairly

taken as 48°. As all the depths are considerable, an error of a degree in
the surface temperature will not have much influence on the comparison,

which stands thus :

   I.

     Stations V. and III., which give the slowest rate of increase, are both
of them in a vein called the ' South Joint ; ' and Stations IV. and I., which
agree well with each other, though differing from the rest, are both of
them in another vein called the ' Talargoch vein ; ' while Station VI.
is in the rock. The horizontal distance between IV. and III. is only

120 yards : but if we attempt to deduce the rate of increase from com-
paring these two, we have an increase of only 0'6° in 195 feet. It thus

appears that, notwithstanding the proximity of the two veins, their con-

ditions as to temperature are very different.

    Widely as the results differ among themselves, they agree upon the
whole in showing that the average rate of increase is slow; and this
28 BEPORT-- 1880.

general result is in harmony with what has been found at the nearest

localities mentioned in our previous reports, namely, Dukinfield and Liver-

pool. Here, as at Dukinfield, all the strata are highly inclined.

Some additional observations at Dukinfield have recently been made

for the Committee, by Mr. Edward Garside, student of engineering in

Queen's College, Belfast. The Astley Pit, in which they were taken, has

now been carried to a much greater depth than it had extended at the

Wm.time of Sir                               Fairbairn's observations, to which allusion was made in

our Report for 1870. The two deepest seams of coal in it are called the

' Cannel Mine ' and the ' Black Mine,' the former being the deeper of

the two                                      they both slope downwards at about  15°, the  deepest point being
                                          ;

the far end of the Cannel Mine. The following is Mr. Garside's summary

of the observations ; the ' surface-depth ' being distinguished fi-om the

' shaft-depth ' because the surface is not level, but slopes slightly in the

same general direction as the seams. The shaft-depth gives the difference

of levels, but the surface-depth, which is practically the same as the

distance of the nearest point of the surface, is what we must use in com-

puting the rate of increase of temperature.

or 2055 feet, and tlie temperature which he found at this depth (75-°) is
within less than a degree of the temperature which would be calculated

from the observations now reported.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. 0. J. Lodge (Secretary),
   Professor W. E. Ayrton, and Professor J. Perry, apfjointed for the
  purpose of devising and constructing an improved form of High
   Insulation Key for Electrometer Work.

In the construction of the key it was considered desirable to secure as

fiar as possible the following conditions :

1. That the insulation should be nearly perfect.

2. That the conductors should have a very small electrostatic capacity.
3. That they should be entirely protected from all external induction

        by a metal case.

4. That the hand of the operator should work the moving parts from
         the outside of the case, so as neither to act inductively on the
         conductors, nor to electrify insulators by friction.

5. That there should be no friction whatever between insulators and
        conductors in the moving pai'ts.

6. That all the insulating parts should be easily removable occasionally

          for cleaning purposes.

7. That the commercial price of the key should not be unreasonably

high.

     In the original form of the key the conductors were platinum wires
suspended inside a metal case by silk threads, the leading wires being
brought to them through large holes in the case. It was found, however,
that this arrangement was rather too delicate and troublesome for general
use, and it was impossible to artificially dry the air in the case because of

the large holes in it.

     It was determined, therefore, to abandon silk strings and to use rigid
supports for the conductors, and to allow the conductors to protrude
through small holes in the case, so that the leading wires might not have
to enter the case to reach them.

For the supports it was ultimately decided to use, not ebonite, but glass,

as the latter is more easily cleaned, and in a dry atmosphere has probably

the better  insulating power                                                                              moreover  it is  not liable to  contract  a coat
                                                                                                       ;

of acid, which acting on the metal conductors gives rise to a feeble E.M.F.

causing some keys to act as extremely weak batteries.

The insulators are four thin pillars of carefully selected glass, mounted

in the case in such a way that they can be easily taken out and cleaned

occasionally. Brass caps are cemented to the top of each of the pillars,
which are so arranged that each cap is near a small hole in the side of the
case, and a short thin rod ending in a binding screw is passed through this
hole and screwed into each brass cap after they are in position.

     Small ebonite plugs slide on these rods and ordinarily close the holes

through which the rods pass, except when pulled out. When very good
30 EEPORT 1880.

insulation is required they are pulled out so as to leave the conductors free

of the holes, touching nothing.

     To each of one pair of brass caps a short brass pin is attached, the
two projecting horizontally one above the other. To the other pair two

brass or bronze flat springs are screwed, which project between the two
pins attached to the other pair of caps. Except when depressed the
springs both press upon the upper of the two pins and make contact with

it. AH the contact surfaces are gilt. Either spring can be depressed

separately without bringing the hand near it, by means of a thin g-lass

rod, which works through a hole in the top of the case, and which is

shod with metal above and below, so that it may not be subject to any

friction which might electrify it.

The piece of metal at the top is a brass cap sliding over a tube fixed in

the top of the case in such a way as to exclude dust ; it can be pressed

Adown with the fingers, and is sent up again by a spiral spring.  pin

and double bayonet-slot is also arranged so as to fix the piece perma-
nently in either of three positions, viz., completely up and in contact

with the top pin, completely down and in contact with the bottom pin,

half-way or insulated.

     In its present form the key is in principle simply an ordinary double

reversing key turned upside down and shut up in a box.

The glass pillars are fixed to the lid instead of to the floor of the case

for several reasons, one of which is that it economises space and reduces

the height of the key. The lid can be unscrewed and taken out of the

case with all the working parts in situ, which is very convenient. The

Afloor of the case is quite free and can be removed at pleasure.  dish

stands on it to contain pumice soaked with sulphuric acid whenever

extra insulation is required. Without any artificial drying, however, the

insulation is very good. The dish is made either of lead, or of glass pro-

tected from the working parts by a covering of wire gauze.

  --The key has been made by Elliott Bros, in two forms one square, the

other round. The round form of case is distinctly the cheaper ; it

necessitates a slight modification in the arrangement of the working

parts, but it appears to be nearly as convenient as the other.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cayley, F.R.S.y
   Professor Gr. Gr. Stokes, F.R.S., Professor H. J, S. Smith, F.R.S.^
   Professor Sir William Thomson, F.R.S., Mr. James Glaisher,

   F.R.S., and Mr. J. W. L. GtLAISHER, F.R.S. (Secretary), on Ma-
   thematical Tables. Drawn up by Mr. J. W. L. GtLAIsher.

The present Report relates to the factor tables for the fourth, fifth, and sixth
millions, and to some results of the enumeration of the primes in the

fifth million and the first five millions. In Section I. an account is given
of the state of the work, two volumes of which have been pubUshed,
while a portion of the third and concluding volume is already in type.
Section II. contains in a condensed form results relating to the distribu-
tion of primes in the fifth million, obtained by enumerating the primes in
                                                                                    ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                                                                                                   31

eacli hundred, or century, in that million : it is similar to Part I. of last

year's Report, -which related to the fourth million.

As the factor tables for the first five millions ai'e now published, so

that it is for the first time possible to extend the enumerations continuously

from to 5,000,000, it was thought desii'able to give here in a tabular

form the main facts relating to the distribution of primes over this range :
these tables form Section III. The results are given very briefly, because

it is hoped that by next year the series of tables will be complete as far

as 9,000,000, and a more detailed examination is deferred till it can be

rendered as complete as possible.

One of the objects to which enumerations of primes are most directly

applicable is the examination of the degree of accuracy with which the

numbers of pi-imes in any given intervals are represented by certain

Aformute which have been proposed for the purpose.                                                                                                                                                               formula of this

kind was proposed by Legendre, and another was independently obtained

I. State of the Factor Tahles for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Millions.

     During the year the calculation for the three millions has been com-
pleted, and the printing of the tables has been steadily continued under
the direction of Mr. James Glaisher. The volumes containing the factor
tables for the fourth and fifth millions have been published, and twenty

pages of the volume containing the sixth million are now printed and

stereotyped.

The fourth million was published in December, 1879, by Messrs.

Taylor and Francis. The table itself occupies 112 pages, and is uniform

with those of Biirckhardt and Dase. There is an introduction of fifty-

two pages, consisting of eight sections and an appendix. The titles of

the sections are (1) Manner of using the Table; (2) The Tables of

Burckhardt, Dase, and Chernac                                                                                                                                                            (3) Mode of Construction of the

Logarithms. The appendix contains a list of prime numbers from 1 to

30,o41 with differences : this list was used in the determination of least

factors by the multiple method. There is also a specimen of one of the

lithographed sheets used in the calculation of the table, and from which

the sieves w^ere formed by stamping out certain of the squares. An

abstract of the third section, which relates to the mode of construction

of the table, appeared in the Report for 1878, and an abstract of the

seventh section, which contains the tables derived from the enumeration

of the primes in the fourth million, formed Part I. of last year's Report.

The introduction to this million is intended to apply to the whole

three millions.

     The fifth million was published in July of this year. The introduction,
which contains eleven pages, consists of only two sections, the first of

which relates to the manner of using the table, and the second to the

results of the enumeration of the primes in the fifth million. An abstract

of the latter forms Section II. of this Report.
--32 REPORT 1880.

The sixth million is still in tie press, and the pi'inbing and stereotyping

of the table will be completed early next year. It is intended to prefix

to this volume an introduction containing the results of the enumerations

for the whole nine millions over which the printed tables will then extend,

with comparisons of the numbers found by counting with those given by

ALegendre's formula and the li x formula.  table of the values of li x

of 250,000 up to 5,000,000 are given in Section IV.

       II. Results of the Enumeration of the Primes in the Fifth Million.

   The following table, which is similar to that given on p. 47 of last
year's Report, contains the chief results of the enumeration of the primes
in the fifth million, arranged according to the numbers of primes in

the centuries.

was employed by Gauss early in the century to represent approximately
the number of primes inferior to x ; but his researches were not published
till 1863.' This integral was also used for the same purpose by

Tchebycheff ^ in 1848 and Hargreave ^ in 1849.
     The following table exhibits the amount of deviation between the

numbers of primes counted and the values given by Legendre's formula.
38 BEPOBT-- 1880.

    From these tables it appears that although the deviations are less for

Legendre's formula than for the li x formula, the former increase in a

more rapid ratio than the latter. As Legendre's formula contains a

disposable constant, chosen so that the values given by the formula might
represent well the results of the enumerations for comparatively small
values of x, it is to be expected the deviations would for some time be less
than in the case of the logarithm integral formula, in obtaining which x is
is supposed to be very large.

     The portion of the former of these two tables up to 4,000,000 has

appeared in a paper ' On the value of the constant in Legendre's formula
for the number of primes inferior to a given number,' ^ but the extension

to 5,000,000 is new. This paper also contains comparisons between the
numbers of primes counted and those given by the formulas :

up to 4,000,000. These have also been extended to 5,000,000 ; but it
seems scarcely worth while to give the tables here, as the extension
amounts to only one million.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sylvestek {Chair-
   man), Professor Cayley, a7id Professor Salmon, appointed for
   the purpose of calculating Tables of the Fxindaraental Invariants
   of Algebraic Forms.

In consequence of the academical engagements of Mr. (now Dr.) F.
Franklin, the trained and skilled assistant in the computation of the
tables, only a small portion (81. 5s.) of the SOL granted by the Associa-
tion has been expended.

     With this sum the tables for the generating functions and ground-
forms of all single quantics, up to the lOfch order inclusive, have been
corrected and completed, and the tables relating to binary systems of
quantics for all combinations of orders up to the 4th inclusive, re-
calculated. The results have been published in extenso in the ' American

Journal of Mathematics.'
     This revision has led to the discovery that two of the forms included

in the table of ground-forms for a pair of cubics previously accepted as
correct arc composite forms, and should be omitted from the catalogue.

     The table affected with this error had been calculated by the German
mathematicians after Gordan's, and by Mr. Sylvester after an entirely

different method, and the results were in perfect but fallacious accord.

    The German method, it may be stated, never offers a complete

guarantee against the occurrence of an error of this nature ; its per-

petuation in the table as calculated by Mr. Sylvester was due to an

arithmetical oversight on his part.
     The detection of this grave error is due to the fortunate oircum-

stance of the co-operation of Dr. Franklin, whose skill, fidelity, and

accuracy as a computer it is impossible to praise too highly.

    His time being now again available for undertaking this kind of

work, for which he possesses unrivalled aptitude, the Committee request

a renewal of the grant of bOl. for carrying it on.

Report of Observations of Lumi'iious Meteors during the year
   1879-80, by a Committee consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S.y
   &c., E. J. Lowe, F.R.S., &c., Professor E. S. Ball, F.R.S., &c..

   Professor G-. Forbes, F.R.S.E., Walter Flight, D.Sc, F.G.S.y

   and Professor A. S. Herschel, M.A., F.R.A.S.

Twenty annual reports having been already presented by this Committee-

since its first appointment in the year 185i», it is proposed in this, its
twenty-first report, to review the result of the records and researches upon
which (independently of the twelve preceding annual reports presented
by Professor Baden-Powell) the Committee has during that long period
been engaged.

     In a treatise on ' Atmospheric Phenomena,' published by Mr. B. J,
Lowe (one of the present, as well as an original member of this Com-

mittee,) in the year 1846, a copious collection of accounts of halos,
auroras, and other unusual meteorological appearances, omitting, however,

notes of fireballs and shooting stars, served, for the first time probably to

many English readers, an important purpose in separating entirely the'
latter class of phenomena from those equally conspicuous and notable

appearances which are of a purely meteorological origin and signification.
The example of orderly arrangement of such descriptions which this work
supplied was followed up and soon afterwards supplemented by the records
of ordinary and extraordinary observations of luminous meteors begun by
Professor Baden-Powell in the year 1855, and continued in subsequent

annual reports of the Bx'itish Association until the present time.
      Immensely as the theory of meteor-systems has progressed during the

long season of attention which has thus been directly bestowed upon them,
the apparitions of fireballs and falling stai'sare still as striking and remark-
able phenomena as they used formerly to be, and in some important respects
also they remain just as truly problematical ' exhalations of the skies ' as

they were in former days. For although they are now known to be as-

tronomical bodies, instead of objects depending on the winds and other
uncertain meteorological conditions for their vai'ious aspects and produc-
tion, yet no astronomical theoiy has yet been discovered or constructed
sufiiciently far-reaching and adapted to account at the same time satis-
factorily both for the well-known occui'rences of meteor-showers, and also
for sporadic meteors, including the rarer phenomena of fireballs and

aerolites.

     References and allusions are abundantly made in the later years of

these Reports both to the well-known discovery of tie clustering together
40                          KEPORT-- 1880.         ->

of meteoric showers and certain periodic comets in the same circum-

solar orbits, and also to the general theory of gatherings of star-dust in

nebular bodies, applied to explain the origin of all classes of meteoric

phenomena by Schiaparelli.

    In recent years' appendices to the Reports the additions to our know-

ledge of the mineralogical structure and probable past history of aerolites

is also amply reviewed ; and the real paths of aerolitic and detonating

Ameteors have in several instances been found from observations.

recapitulation of these leading views, and of the observations chronicled

in aerolitic and meteoric parts of the Reports during the latter and

larger part of the long period of their continuation, leads to the conclu-

sion that little (if any) similarity of character can yet be confidently

recognised to exist between aerolites, or detonating fireballs and the

equally rare and magnificent meteoric phenomena of cometary star-

showers.

    The intermediate class of sporadic fireballs and shooting stars has been

largely and closely examined and discussed, with consequences of the

greatest importance to their scientific discrimination and description.
The number of meteor-showers or radiant-points proved to be productive

of ordinary displays of shooting stars has been greatly multiplied by

observations and reductions ; some few of them, in particular, being
shown to be limited and confined to one or two days only of duration, in

the annual dates of their appearance.

    Fireballs of various magnitudes, of whose real paths simultaneous

observations furnished good determinations, have not unfrequently been
shown to be conformable to well-established radiant-points of shooting

stars ; and among the many hundreds of meteor radiant-points that have
now been recorded, there is also suificient evidence to show that many of

the ordinary meteor-systems which they denote may very probably be

following in the trains or orbits of certain formerly recorded comets.

    Although presumptive views of a naturally wide distinction between

aerolites and cometary shower-meteors are far from being yet refuted and

trplajned away by recent theories and observations yet the real paths of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

more than one detonating meteor have now been retraced to recognised

ordinary radiant-points of shooting stars. The course of the large

detonating fireball of Nov. 23, 1878, moreover, while it was strictly con-

formable to the well-marked radiant-point of the a-Taurids of November,

presented also a very close accordance with the somewhat uncertainly

determined orbit (because founded on rather scanty observations) of the

periodic comet of 1702.

    Much aid, it will be seen from this short outline of the Committee's

labours during twenty years, has been afforded by its annual compilations

to advance the present astronomical theory of shooting stars with

materials of observation and by reviews of contemporary speculations.
     The opportunities of which the Committee has hitherto been able to

avail itself for correspondence and reductions of the observations annually

received have not been adequate during the last two years for producing

Aa complete category of their yearly undertaking.  detention like that

required last year of some of the meteor contributions, and a deferment

for a season of some reviews of printed memoirs on meteoric subjects,

must accordingly be granted for the present, until the occasion may occur
when a more convenient opportunity may offer itself for their presenta-

tion.                                                                   '

     In the following appendix of this interim Report some errors are cor-
rected of which the occurrence in the last two years' Reports passed
undetected until after the publication of the volumes in which they were

accidentally recorded. The earliest opportunity within its reach is now

taken by the Committee to rectify these errors and to point out some
errors in earlier Reports, to the appearance of which the brief survey of
those Reports required for preparing the above short outline of the whole
series ofthem has been the immediate occasion of drawing the Committee's
attention. In another appendix, by Dr. Walter Flight, the occurrences
of stonefalls, and abstracts of the analyses and discussions relating to
them, vrhich have taken place during the past year, are recorded.

Revisions and Corrections of real paths of Meteors, and of other results of

ohservations contained in the Reports of the last two and of some prs-

ceding years.                                 \

During the first years following the appointment of the Committee in

the year 1860 for the collection of meteor observations, the importance of

noting the radiant-points of observed meteors' tracks was not yet recog-

nised, and was far from being generally practised and regarded. The

real directions of flight of many shooting-stars and fireballs, the positions

of whose real courses were found from simultaneous observations during

several years previous to 1866, were accordingly only indicated, if at all,

by the altitude and azimuth of the point from which the meteor proceeded

or was directed in its line of flight towards the earth. Many of the

meteors of which the real paths were investigated from more or less

plentiful accounts of their appearance, in the appendices of these reports

for the years 1860-66, were brilliant and sometimes detonating fireballs,

besides some smaller shooting-stars. Among the adjustments needed to

accommodate the rough observations to each other the choice and deduc-

tion of the radiant-point had at that period of the Committee's first

proceedings not yet acquired the significancy with which on astronomical

grounds it has more recently been invested, the principal objects of those

earlier determinations having simply been to obtain the real heights and

the lengths of path and velocities of the meteors' flights. Fair weight for

determining the radiant-point was accordingly not always allowed to the

best recorded observations  for  this  purpose                                        and  some  obvious  radiant-
                                                                                   ;

points like those of the ' Leonids,' &c., not being then established," con-

siderable errors from this cause, and occasionally also from mistaken

calculations, have been detected in a review of the many real paths de-

scribed in the above-named part of these reports as regards the directions,

or as concerning the astronomical positions in right-ascension and declina-

tion of the radiant-points from which those fine meteors were directed.
The radiant-point positions given in the subjoined list sometimes differ

slightly, from fresh projections and comparisons of the best observations,
from those of the real paths adopted in the earlier reports. In cases

·where the errors discovered are, from various causes, of much larger

magnitude, however, than these small emendations of the original re-

ductions, the nature of the hitherto unnoticed misconstructions is stated

and explained in notes which are appended to the list.

46        EEPORT-- 1880.

  KOTES. Bectification of some Meteor- trachs referred to in the present list.

   --No. 6.- The real path of this meteor given at p. 78 of the volume for

18G2 of these Reports is entirely erroneous from an accidental perversion
in the calculation of one of the simultaneous observations. The computed
path rests upon a supposed foreshortened view of the meteor at Manchester

near e Pegasi ; but the star named in Mr. Baxendell's observation of the
meteor there was e Capricorni. The real flight of the meteor was therefore
much lower than was supposed ; and so far as the correction which it

requires affects the position of the radiant-point, the original observations

have again been projected and compared together. The most probable
place of the radiant-point obtained from the new comparison of the re-
corded tracks is that near \p Capricorni which is assigned to the meteor
in the present list. The August shooting-stars (A,B,C,D,E,) of which
approximate real paths are given on the same page of the volume of
Reports for 1862 (all of them apparently scattered Perseids) were too
roughly observed to allow any dependence for useful comparisons to be
placed on their astronomical radiant-points. The positions of those points
were only guessed or indicated loosely from the observations to assist the

--remainder of the calculations.
     No. 12. The direction and position of the real path of this meteor
given at page 80, in the above volume of these Reports, are, by some
mistake made in the graphical projections, greatly at variance with the
precise and accordant observations from which they are derived. The
meteor's horizontal flight was directed almost exactly from east to west
instead of (as it is described) from about thirty degrees south of east.
The correction, corresponding to this needful emendation of the real path,

is introduced in the present list in the observed astronomical position of

the meteor's I'adiant-point.

     The radiant here adopted of the meteor No. 14, is also, to accord more
perfectly with the best accounts, placed fifteen or twenty degrees nearer
to the true east point than the position at the same altitude in due N.E.,
which it is assumed to have occupied in the description given at the same
page of the above year's Report, of that fireball's real path.

     In the account of the real path of the fireball of February 7, 1863 (at
page 321 of the volume for that year), the Mull of Galway is accidentally
misstated as the locality of its end-point, instead of the Mull of Cantire.

  --No. 29. The two shooting stars described as simultaneously observed

on the morning of November 14, 1863, at page 91 of the volume of these

Reports for the year 1864, were unquestionably ' Leonids ' ; but no
experience of the meteors of that shower having at that time been yet
obtained, their real character was not suspected. The provisional radiant-
points adopted to accommodate the somewhat discordant observations to
each other for calculating their heights, are consequently quite erroneous
and some mistakes of deduction of the real paths seem also to have been
committed in the process of the graphical projections. Although they
emanated from the direction of Leo's Sickle, leaving the well-known
luminous streaks upon their tracks, the simultaneous views recorded of

their flights are not sufficiently distant from each other on a map to afford,

by the backward prolongations and intersections of the tracks, astro-
nomical positions of their respective radiant-points which would be accurate

enough for insertion in the present list.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEOBS.  47

     The teeming multitude of accounts preserved of the great fireball of
December 5, 1863, again, as noticed in the paragraph just following those
relating to the above two shooting-stars, are unavailable (although stre-
nuous attempts to interpret them were made in contemporary reviews)

to furnish anything of sufficient certainty regarding the real direction of
that splendid fireball's flashing, perhaps abruptly deviating and deflected
course, to form a record worth placing and including for preservation in

the present list.

     The provisional radiant-point adopted in the paragraph of the same
Report-Appendix next following those just noticed, on the real path of
the shooting-star (No. 29) of Dec. 6, 1863, is placed, without much
departure from the observations, due east, and nearly horizontal. But the
backward point of intersection of the two nearly adjacent tracks is yet
about S.E., altitude 40°. As there appears no reason to assume a low
radiant-altitude, and a nearly horizontal motion of this slow-moving short-
pathed meteor through the air, from its observed appearance, it seems a
more correct procedure to comply with tlie evidently exact and careful
directions of the two recorded paths in fixing the radiant-point position at

their actual point of intersection. This is accordingly the point given as
a very well- determined radiant-point of the shooting-star in the present

reconstructed list.

  --Nos. 35, 35a. The real earthward course of the fine bolide of August

9th (a.m.), 1864, desciibed (on page 92 of the volume for that year of
these Reports) as concluded from the simultaneous iews of the meteor
obtained at the Luxembourg Observatory in Paris, and at Hawkhurst,
in Kent, must, it appears, be rejected and renounced as quite wrongly laid
down and represented. According to the note by M. Chapelas Coulvier-
Gravier of its appearance in Paris, given without doubt correctly (at p.
56) in the general catalogue of that year's Report, the meteor passed at
Paris from an altitude of eighteen degrees, ten degrees west of north to
the north point of the horizon. But the recorded real path proceeds from
the assumption that the meteor's course at Paris was from 10° east of
north towards the true north point.

     Small as the difierence is (shown in the accompanying figures, 1 and
2), between the supposed and really recorded appearances of the meteor's
path as seen in Paris, the effect upon the radiant-point, from the meteor's
position in the northern sky, at both the stations of the double observation
is prodigious. Instead of being between Perseus and Cassiopeia (E.N.E.,
altitude 60°), as it was represented, the meteor's real radiant-point was

                                           FIC.

                                                                                                           io°j\r

considerably south of the equator, in Aquarius or Capricornus, where the
two recorded apparent paths prolonged backwards, then intersect each
other in the sky. The whole account of the fireball's appearance itself
afibrds the strongest evidence of its being an ' Aquariad,' travelling, as
this comparison shows it to have been, with moderate speed, and with a
--48

slightly sloping path towards true north, at the not unusual height of fifty-

five to forty-five miles above the sea, midway between Harwich and

Ostend. It is, on the other hand, just as signally inconsistent with the
usual character of the swift, streak-leaiving August Perse'ids and Cassio-
peiads, as well as with the great height of expansion and disappearance
over a point of the North Sea in the neighbourhood of Holland. Accord-
ingly, although the meteor's course Avas mapped at both of the observers'
stations so far from its southern radiant-point, yet from the precise
character of the two descriptions, and their nearness to the point of

convergence of the tracks, we may still regard the concluded radiant-

point as very reliably established. It was on the ecliptic near the middle
of the last sign but one before the vernal equinox, between Aquarius and

Capricornus.

^ The direction of flight from altitude 24°, azimuth W. from S. 221°,

noted in a description in the Report of the year 1864, accompanying the
description just discussed, of the real path of another August meteor of

the same date simultaneously observed at the Royal Observatory, Green-

wich, and Hawkhurst, disagrees with the rest of the description of the
path, to which a radiant-point at altitude 39°, azimuth 226° would cor-

respond. The radiant-point directly given by projections of the recorded

+apparent tracks, is 28°    68°,"near x Persei, corresponding to altitude

45°, azimuth 228°, showing that the altitude, at least, of the slope of path

in the table of that shooting-star's reduction, has been accidentally mis-

represented.- The radiant near ^ Persei given dii-ectly by the recorded

tracks is that which has been adopted in the present list.

1 ·· No. 39.^-See the remarks on the corrections in the list, below, of the

volume for 1879 of these Reports, pp. 108 and 120, for a new observa-

tion and reduction of this meteor's real track.

     Rectifications of Errata, and of some false conclusions contained in the

--Reports on Meteor Observations for the years 1878 and 1879. The following

recapitulation of some errata and defects occurring in different portions

of the last two years' Reports are arranged with reference to the lines
and pages of the respective volumes of these Reports where they will be
found, for greater ease and simplicity of their discoveiy and correction.

Remarks on the corrections which they require are given in accompany-

ing notes when the nature or magnitude of the emendations are such as

to call for explanations and elucidation.

. - On account of the existence of several such material oversights, arising

from the length of the Reports, and from lack of opportunities, which the

Committee has had to regret during the last two years, for full and careful

.summaries of meteor records and descriptions, it is found necessary to

condense the comments on these erasures as much as possible. Such

rectifications of them, accordingly, as have already been published else-

vvhere are referred to occasionally in the notes, for further particulars of

the expositions and reconsiderations which they have received. Sufficient

revisions of the several imperfections are only intended to be here afforded

to render the substance of the last two years' Reports as free from con-
temporaneous faults and misconstructions at the time when they were

pi'esented, as these Reports have generally been in former years.

                  error, rectified by the last, of the radiant-point assigned in the

                  cometary radiant-list of the Report of the year 1875, to the

                  comet 1870 I. By the corrected place this comet is entirely

                  separated from all appearance of connection with the ordinary

                  August Perseid-shower ; and the conjecture raised in the above

                  noted passages of the possible origin of a double radiant-centre

                  in the August Perseid-shower of 1878 from the concurrent

                  presence of two nearly coincident comet-orbits in connection

                  with the meteor-stream, is entirely and at once dismissed by the

                  note of the more correct position of that comet's radiant -point.

                  The error of the radiant-place was noticed immediately after

                  the presentation, but not in time to jDrevent its publication in

                  the paragraphs of the Report of the j^ear 1878. The correction

                  which the above passages required was accordingly pointed out

                  in a 'Report on Meteoric Astronomy during the year 1878,' pre-

                  sented to the Royal Astronomical Society in February, 1879

                  (' Monthly Notices,' vol. xxxix. p. 294). Dr. J. L. E. Dreyer, of
                  the Dunsink Observatory, Dublin, who has devoted much atten-

                  tion to the orbit of this comet, has noticed that the true astro-

                  nomical place of its meteor radiant-point (which he gives at

                  27° 51' + 48° 24') is in pretty good agreement with a meteor sys-
                  tem nearly contemporaneous with the Perse'ids, noted by Schmidt

1880.                                      E

                  A letter just received from Mr. Caws states that the meteor

                  which he saw near Ryde was certainly observed in the autumn

                  of one of the years 1863 or 1864, and not, as his original

                  description seemed to intimate, in the year of Donati's comet,

                  1858. The fireball which it described was doubtles^s the grand

                  one which at dusk on the moonlit evening of Nov. 11, 1864,
                  passed over the southern part of France, and which was pretty

                  widely observed there, and in Kent (see these Reports, vol. for

                  1865, pp. 78, 120). The contemporary descriptions, with the
                  addition of this new one, only allow the real path to be roughly

                  assigned (as follows) as a good average combination of the

                  plentiful but loose materials. The meteor began its flight 70 or

                  80 miles above the neighbourhood of Macon, or of a point mid-

                  way between Lyons and Clermont, and passing in mid-path over

                  the southern part of the mountains of Auvergne, ended its

                  course about 50 or 60 miles above a point mid-way between

                  Cahors and Montauban, on the rivers Lot and Tarn. The whole

                  distance of 150 or 200 miles was traversed in about 5 seconds,

                  with a speed of about 35 miles per second, from the direction,

                  roughly, of a radiant-point at about alt. 5° or 10°, in the N.E.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

                  celestial position 85° + 35° ( ± 10°.) The parabolic speed of a

                  meteor with this radiant-point is 32-5 miles per second. A bright

                  streak visible in the twilight sky (at Rhodez, and at Pamiers in

                  Arri&ge) for several minutes, when the nucleus broke up rather

                  suddenly at last, remained along its course like an after-glow

                  of the splendidly luminous white tail, similar in brightness to

                  the head, by which the nucleus was pursued. Its appearance,

                  although extremely brilliant, eclipsing the full moonlight at

                  Rhodez and other places near its path, was unaccompanied by

                  any audible report.

the most numerous are of an asliy-gray ; here and there rounded grains
(the chondra of Gustav Rose) are apparent, as well as yellow or bronzy
grains of pyrrhotine. The grains of nickel iron are very small. The density

of the meteorite is 3-51. By the action of hydrogen chloride 60 per cent,

of the stone dissolves : this consists of olivine, nickel iron, and pyrrhotine ;
the residue under the microscope is found to consist of a great number of

crystalline grains, much acted upon by polarised light, and some of which
show the forms of the prism ; others show the cleavage which indicates

eustatite. Besides these are black grains of chromite with an octahedral

contour.

              1879, May 10, 5jp.m. Estherville, Emmet Co., Iowa}

      This curious meteorite fell near Estherville in lat. 43° 30' N., long.

94° 60' W. within that region of the United States which has been re-

markable for falls of meteorites, three having fallen at Rochester in
Indiana, Cynthiana in Kentucky, and Warrington in Missouri, within the
space of a month. The phenomena attending this fall, of which a short
notice appeared in the Report of last year, were of the usual character,
but on a grander scale. It occurred about five o'clock in the afternoon of

May 10, 1879, with the sun shining brightly. In some places the

meteorite was plainly visible in its passage through the air, and looked like
a ball of fire with a long train of vapour or cloud of fire behind it ; and
 one observer saw it one hundred miles from where it fell. Its course was

for N.W. to S.E. The sounds produced in its course are described

 as being 'terrible' and 'indescribable,' at first louder than the loudest
 artillery, followed by a rumbling noise, as of a train of cars crossing a

bridge. Two persons were within two or three hundred yards of the spots

 where the two larger masses struck the earth. There were distinctly two
 explosions : the first took place at a considerable height in the atmosphere,
 and several fragments were projected to difi"erent points over an area of
 four square miles, the largest going farthest to the east. Another explo-
 sion occurred just before reaching the ground, and this accounts for the
 small fragments found near the largest mass. This latter fell within 200
 feet of a dwelling-house, at a spot where there was a hole, six feet deep,
 filled with water. The clay at the bottom of the hole was excavated to a
 depth of eight feet before the meteorite was reached. The second largest
 mass penetrated blue clay to a depth of five feet, at a spot about two miles
 distant from the first. The third of the larger masses was found on the
 23rd February of the present year at a place four miles distant from the

 first, in a dried-up slough. On digging a hole the stone was met with at

 a depth of five feet. The fragments thus far obtained weigh respectively
 437, 170, 921 28, 10|, 4 and 2 pounds. The height of the meteor is
 calculated to have been 40 miles, and its velocity from 2 to 4 miles per
 second. The masses are rough and knotted, like large mulberry calculi,
 with rounded protuberances projecting from the surface on every side.
 The black coating is not uniform, being most marked between the pro-
 jections. These projections have sometimes a bright metallic surface,

showing tliem to consist of nodules of iron ; and they also contain lumps

of an olive-green mineral, having a distinct and easy cleavage. The

greater part of the stony material is of a grey colour with the green mineral

irregularly disseminated through it. The masses vary very much in

density in their different parts ; the average cannot be less than 4'5.

When a mass is broken one is immediately struck with the large nodules

of metal among the grey and green stony substance ; some of these will

weigh 100 grammes or more. In this respect this meteorite is unique ; it
differs entirely from the siderolites of Pallas, Atacama, &c., or the known

meteoric stones rich in iron, for in none of them has the iron this nodular

character. The large nodules of iron appear to have shrunk away from

the matrix an elongated fissure of from 2 to 3 millimetres sometimes

intervenes, separating the matrix and nodules to the extent of one-half the

circumference of the latter. The only mineral which could be picked out

separately has a slightly green colour : it occurs in masses, from one half-

inch to one inch in size, has an easy cleavage in one direction, and was

found to be olivine. The same mineral occurs in minute rounded con-

dition in other parts of the material ; and minute, almost colourless,

crystalline particles in the cavities are supposed to be olivine. Troilite

Aexists in small quantity.   quantity of the silicates was picked out,

separated as far as possible from iron, and treated with hydrochloric acid.

The ratio of soluble to insoluble silicates varies very much in different

parts of the meteorite, varying from 16 to 60 per cent, for the soluble part.

The insoluble consisted of:

     This is evidently the bronzite commonly found in meteorites.
     The green mineral is the soluble part of the meteorite ; its cleavage in

one direction is very perfect ; its specific gravity is 3-35 ; it has a hardness
of almost 7, and is readily and completely decomposed by hydrochloric

acid. On analysis it was found to have the composition

     This is equivalent to one atom of bronzite and one atom of olivine,
which he says, is ' a form of silicate that we might expect to find in
meteorites ' The nickel iron, as has already been stated, is abundant,
sometimes in large nodules of from 50 to 100 grammes. It displays the

    An eye-witness of the fall of this stone states that in the early morning

he was washing his face, when he saw a ball of fire cross the sky from

north-east to south-west. He was much astonished when a small stone
fell before him from the sky. He caught it up and found it was very hot,

and gave forth a smell like that of gunpowder. The stone is about 1 2 mches
long and three-quarters of an inch wide, and weighs about 100 grams,
Troy. It is completely covered with a hard black glaze. It appears

to be a stone and not meteoric iron.

The same correspondent mentions a meteoric stone of large size, pre-
mserved at Toji, which is said to have fallen from the heavens  ancient

times ; and reports another at Chionin. He also says : ' I learn that a
Btone of several pounds weight fell at Tamba a few years ago.'

The same number of the ' Japan Gazette ' contains a short reference to

another aerolite. The mineral stone which fell some time ago at the front of

a gate of Iwata, of Takeda-mura, Yabe-gori, Tajima, with a brilliant light
Hand report, is about sun thick and 9 suniu circumference, and weighs
about 200 momme. This stone has been sent to the Bureau of Agriculture
of the Home Department, and will be investigated by Prof. Kinch.

First and Second Reports of the Committee, consisting of Mr. David
   Gill, Professor Gr. Forbes, Mr. Howard GtRUBb, and Mr. C. H.

   GiMiNGHAM, appointed to consider the question of Improvements
   in Astronomical Clocks.

            First Bepcrt. By Mr. David Gill.'

To maintain the motion of a free pendulum in a uniform arc, when the

pendulum is kept in uniform pressure and temperature, and to record the

number  of  vibrations which the  pendulum performs,                                                                               is  to  realise  the
                                                                                                                                .

conditions which constitute a perfect clock.

The conditions of absolute uniformity of impulse are, ivith one exception,

realised in the following arrangement.

Let s (figs. 1, 2, 3) be the point of suspension of a pendulum, and P,

in the same figures, the pendulum rod.

Fig. 1.                           Fig. 2.                                                                                              Fig. 3.

    Let w be an impulse-piece of the shape shown, suspended by a piece

of very delicate spring, so as to swing accurately from the same centre as
the pendalum.

     M is an electro-magnet, N an armature mounted on an arm A, which is

pivoted at Q.

     In fig. 1 the pendulum is supposed at rest ; but the armature N, and
the arm A are drawn, as they cannot remain, for a must either be pulled
against the backing pin p, by the spiral spring k, or against p2, by the

attraction of the electro-magnet m.

     Let us now suppose that matters are so arranged that when the im-
pulse-piece w acts upon the pendulum, a galvanic circuit is completed,
and M becomes an electro-magnet, we shall then have the position of the
arm A, and of the impulse arm w, as in fig. 3, and when the impulse
weight and pendulum rod are separated, we shall have the position of
these as shown in fig. 2.

author's request.

Now let us follow the action of this escapement.

First suppose the battery to be attached when matters are in the

position shown in fig. 1. The effect will bs that the arm A will be di-awn

against p^- If ^^ now set the pendulum swinging to the right the

impulse arm w will follow the pendulum as far as the arm A will allow it

to do so, but on reaching this limit, the pendulum will leave the impulse

arm and continue to swing to the right alone.

    The instant, however, that the contact between w and P is thus broken,

M is no longer an electro-magnet, and the arm A is drawn by the spiral

spring to the position of fig.  2             the  pendulum  continues its swing to the
                                           ;

right, comes to rest, and returns. On its return it encounters the impulse-

piece w, not where it left it (viz., at its lowest limits, the arm A resting on

P2), but as in fig. 2, the arm A resting on p,. When P and \v encounter,

the immediate result is that, contact being formed, M becomes a magnet,

wand the arm A is drawn against jjj. whilst the impulse-piece continues

its motion towards the left, along with the pendulum, and returns again
to the right with the pendulum till it is stopped by encountering the arm

A pressing against ^2-

  --Simply stated, the impulse is this : The pendulum in swinging

against the impulse-weight picks it up at _pi, and in swinging with the
impulse-weight it carries it on pastp, as far as p<i. The effective impulse

wis, therefore, that of the fall of the resolved horizontal force of in falling

from p, to j)2-

This force is absolutely constant.

There is no locking or unlocking, and no friction, and no element of

wchange except such as may be due to the electric contact between  and P.

Such contacts are liable to wear and to stick, and it was not until some

prospect offered of overcoming this fault that we ventured to request

a grant from the Association. The plan of escapement had already been

contrived and tried experimentally by Mr. Gill ; but it was in conse-

quence of an idea of Mr. Gimingham's that it first seemed possible to

overcome the outstanding difficulty and attain a nearer approach to

perfection.

     Mr. Gimingham's idea was to construct a relay which could be
worked by radiation. This relay he first contrived for the purpose of

registering the number of revolutions of a radiometer.
    The form which this relay has now assumed, after a variety of expe-

riments, is shown in fig. 4.

                                              Fig. 4.

     K is a very light arm of aluminium, mounted on needle-poinfcB.
     B is a fan of mica, coated on one side with lampblack.

     c is a carbon point attached to k.

    By means of an aluminium ring r, fitting spring-tight into a glass tube,

--the supports of the needle-points of k are fixed in position the supports

being attached to the ring.
     Another ring, t, carries a small carbon anvil, against which the carbon

point c can come in contact.
--58 EEPOET 1880.

     Two platinum wires, in connection witli r and / respectively, are fixed

into opposite ends of the tube.

     The tube is then exhausted till a Crookes' vacuum is obtained, when
the arm K becomes a radiometer arm.

    A small slip of magnetised watch-spring is attached to B, so that a

fixed magnet can be so placed as just to bring the carbon point and anvil

in direct contact.

    A strong light being then turned on B, the screen acts like a radiometer

arm, moves back, separates the carbon points, and contact is broken.

     By attaching a simple screen to the pendulum, it therefore becomes

possible to cause the pendulum, by alternating, to admit and cut ofi" light
from B, and so produce alternate make and break, entirely as required
by the escapement, without employing any actual contact on the pen-
dulum.

     The chief difficulty we now find is a tendency of the carbon points to
stick, and some experiments are now being made relative to this matter.

     Four relays on the principle described have been constructed and are
in the hands of the committee for experiment, and Mr. Gill has, besides,
a model of the escapement, and a pendulum with which experiments are
being carried out.

    A sum of 12Z. 12s. has been expended out of the grant of SOI., and

the Committee requests that the balance of the grant should be allowed to
be applied to the same research.

                                                  Second Beport.

     Since the foregoing report was sent from the Cape by Mr. Gill, I have

devoted much time in developing the mode of electric contact-making by

radiation.

     In the above report for last year is described a form of the radio-
relay which at the time seemed to give the most promising results
of any that I had tried. Four of these were made, as mentioned by Mr.
Gill, one of "which he took out to the Cape, experimented with, and in the
report he mentions the chief difficulty as being that of the tendency of

the contacts to stick together when work is being done by the current.

      In the case of using contacts of metal, such as platinum, this diffi-
culty is insurmountable, for the reason that the power required to sepa-

rate the contacts when once closed is far greater than that which can be

obtained from any source of radiation that could be used for our purpose.
This point I had settled some time back, and had almost abandoned the
idea of success, when the discovery of the microphone by Prof. Hughes

suggested to me the idea of using carbon contacts. I then commenced

working on the subject again, and experimented with a great number of

instruments of different forms.

     The form of a pendulum with the contacts near the point of suspension
has at present given the most satisfactory results. Fig. 5 represents the
pendulum form of the radio-relay ; a is a strip of moderately thin alumi-
nium, to the lower end of which is attached a plate of silver flake mica
b, blackened on the outer face ; c is a clear mica screen, the same size as
the plate b, also attached to the lower end of a, enclosing a space of

about 6 mm. between the two plates.

     The strip of aluminium a is suspended by two springs of soft iron
wire, beaten out flat and very thin in the centre, represented by d in
           ON IMPROVEMENTS IN ASTRONOMICAL CLOCKS.          59

section and dd' in elevation. The springs are in metallic connection

with the platinnm wire e, which is hermetically sealed through the tube
A. To the other platinum wire /, the inner end of which is beaten
out into a thin sjiring, is attached a carbon point cj, h being the cor-

responding carbon plate attached to the pen-       Fig. 5.

dulum, just below the suspension springs. The

whole is enclosed in the tube A, which is ex-

panded into a bulb at the lower end, exhausted

from the end B, and hermetically sealed.

    On placing a source of radiation in front of

the blackened surface h, and allowing a screen

to move to and fro between the source of radia-

tion and the bulb, contact will be alternately

made and broken" between the carbons g and li.
In order to give an idea of the amount of radia-

ting force required to produce a Crookes' pres-

sure of sufficient power to work an instrument

of this kind, I will mention that a candle placed

four or five inches ofi" the bulb, with a concave

reflector at the back, answers exceedingly well,

providing the surface 6 is about \\ square

inch in area. The actual efifective force also

depends to a great extent upon the distance

between the surface h and the glass envelope.

For this reason I have tried using a clear mica

screen, placed inside the bulb very close to the

black surface ; but although theory would indi-
cate the advisability of so doing, practice shows

that very little advantage is gained by the in-

troduction of such a screen, the fact being par-

tially accounted for by its forming a second

obstruction to the radiant force from the light

used to work the relay.

    By the introduction of carbon contacts I had hoped to have entirely

avoided their sticking together when the current passed. Although for

all practical purposes their employment together with the pendulum form

of instrument has suflBciently reduced this sticking, yet to a certain ex-

tent it still remains a drawback to the use of such a delicate force for

making contact as that to be obtained from this indirect action of the

radiation from a small lamp or candle.

    When the contacts merely pass the current through a short length of

straight wire, there is little or no sticking, but on the introduction of

an electro-magnet, a bright spark passes between the contacts, and stick-

ing occurs. The spark is well known to be due to the discharge of the

extra currents set up in the coils of the magnet, and I expected that

both the spark and the sticking would disappear on attaching a tin-foil

condenser to the terminals of the relay. On trying this experiment

the spark was reduced, but there was no observable alteration in the

sticking.

      This sticking is probably due either to the carbon containing a
fusible ash, or the attraction caused by the close proximity of the two large

surfaces of oppositely charged carbon, large compared with the part that

absolutely touches and through which only part of the current would be
--60 EEPORT 1880.

passing. I have tried several kinds of carbon for the contacts, but the
finest electric-lamp carbon seems to be the only available sort, the resistance
of more compact carbons being too high. I have also tried using contacts
of platinum, iridium, also one of platinum and the other of gold, platinum
and iridium, carbon and iridium, carbon and platinum, all of which stick

together more than when both are of carbon.
     In order to overcome the, for the present, inevitable amount of sticking

of the carbon contacts, it is necessary to multiply the force for making
and breaking contact by means of long leverage. It will be seen that
in the pendulum an^angement described, any amount of leverage can be
easily obtained without the friction or resistance that would be caused by

pivots.

     The force, also, obtainable from a given source of radiation, is greatly
augmented in this instrument by the use of a screen placed a little dis-
tance behind the blackened surface, but fixed to it as part of the pendulum

bob. In this way nearly the maximum amount of Crookes' pressure

is obtained, all acting in the one direction, whereas, if there be no screen
behind the black surface, the heat transmitted through the blackened
mica sets up a considerable Crookes' pressure, which acts between the
bulb and the back of the blackened mica, considerably reducing the

effective force in front.

      In experimenting with these various radio-relays, I have used a
seconds pendulum, having an escapement similar to that described by

Mr. Gill in his report for last year.
      It has been necessary to use an ordinary, but very sensitive, relay

between the radio-relay and the pfendulum, as it is best to have as weak

a current as possible passing through the carbon contacts.

    I regret that my experiments in the radio-relay part of the subject
should have extended over such a long period, but the time I have at my

disposal for original work is very limited.
      I also regret that I cannot be present at the meeting this year, to

show the various relays, and receive suggestions from the members of
Section A. I shall, however, carefully study any discussion that may be
recorded on the subject, and in the continuation of the experiments make
use of any suggestions with great pleasure.

                                                                                  C. H. GiMINGHAM.

--Dear Mr. Gimingham, I return you herewith Mr. Gill's letter and

diagrams. The principle of his proposed arrangement seems admirable,

provided a perfect system of contacts could be devised, and your plan for

them is unexceptionable in theory ; but as it appears that the carrying out

of the details may be a little troublesome, I have had recourse for the

present to a more simple contrivance, which, though not so perfect

theoretically, will, I believe, be found to work very well in practice.

AI annex a figure (fig. 6) which represents the arrangement.             very

small magnetised needle A a is pivoted as a compass needle on a vertical

pin b. In a plane above or below this is pivoted a light forked lever d dd

so placed that a pin c in the magnetised needle, hits one or other of the

prongs of the fork dd SiS it swings from side to side. At the extreme end

of the lever d is fixed a fine fibre of spun glass slightly buckled by the

screw t ; this has the effect of putting the forked lever d d into a state of

unstable equilibrium and compelling it to keep in contact with one or

other of the contact screws s s'. The whole apparatus is enclosed in an
                    ON THE ELASTICITY OF -WIRES.                                                                                                               61

exhausted glass tube (to prevent oxidation of the gold contacts) and when

required for use is placed in the clock case just below the iron ' bob ' of

the pendulum.                                                                                                                                         Fig. 6.

    As the pendulum swings the magnet answers

to its motion and draws the forked lever into

contact with either of the screws s s' which are

tipped with gold. The buckling of the glass

fibre tends to make the contact very cei'tain

and avoids any danger of recoil, while there

being no oxygen left in the tube there can of

course be no oxidation of the contacts.

It is supposed that the clock has a mercurial

pendulum with cast-iron cistern, as most pendu-

lums are now made.

The above arrangement is not theoretically

perfect, for there must of course be some slight

reaction from the magnet to the pendulum ; but

as the pendulum weighs, or should weigh, about

forty pounds and the magnet about ten grains,

the reaction must be very slight, and even this                                                                                                                'mrmnrv
                                                                                                                                         'rrrrrrt^ '

would be of no consequence provided the mag-

netisation of the needle remained constant.

The convenience of the arraugement, and

the ease with which it can be applied without

interfering or tampering with the clock, com-

mends it for practical work.

The only practical fault I see in Mr. Gill's

arrangement for driving the pendulum, is the

extremely small ' travel ' which the impulse lever

has in each impulse. This will necessitate very perfect 'banking ' arrange-

ments, for a very small difference in this travel will make a large difference

in the impulse on the pendulum, and the perfection of the arrangement

depends on the impulse being a constant. It appears to me that it would

be desirable to make the impulse-arm very light, but longer in its travel,

and acting perhaps farther down on the pendulum rod.

These are the only points that occur to me.

                                         Faithfully yours,

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William

   Thomson, Professor Tait, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. F. J. Bram-
   WELL, and Mr. J. T. Bottomley (Secretary), for commencing

   Secular Experivients on the Elasticity of Wires.

The Committee have but little to add to their reports of the last years.
The arrangements in the tower of Glasgow University may now be

regarded as complete, so far as concerns the wires already suspended

there for experiment. At the last meeting of the Association it was
reported that pairs of wires of gold, platinum, and palladium had been.

suspended in tlie tube provided for their protection, and that they had
been carefully marked and measured. Since the last meeting observa-
tions have been made at intervals on the lengths of the wires, and these
have been carefully recorded. It cannot be said that there has been any
perceptible lengthening of the vrires within the last year.

     Some improvements have been made as to caulking the joints of the

protecting tube in order to avoid disturbance of the wires by currents of

air.

   A set of drawings, showing the mode of suspension of the wires,

the marks that have been put upon them, the arrangements of the

cathetometer, &c., in such a way as may be useful for reference at any

future time, is nearly ready, and will be published in next year's Report.

continued day by day, in the manner adopted at the beginning and

described in previous reports.

  --The Rocky Chamber. Tour Committee, describing in their last re-

On' its eastern side, the third or innermost reach of Clinnick's GaUery

opens into a large chamber, which the workmen have just begun to

explore.' (' Rep. Brit. Assoc' 1879, p. 147.) This portion, now known
as ' The Rocky Chamber,' is 56 feet long, about 28 feet in greatest breadth,

and about 13 feet in greatest height, which it attains near the centre. It
is ornamented with numerous striking stalagmites and stalactites, though
less profusely than the two small adjacent chambers described last year
(Ibid.) These have been left intact so far as possible, and will, no doubt,
in future render this Chamber the most attractive part of the Cavern to

ordinary visitors.

     The deposits in the first or western part of the chamber were the
well-known ' Breccia,' or oldest of the Cavern beds, with its characteristic
' Crystalline Stalagmite ' overlying it immediately. Each of these
' thinned out ' entirely before the centre of the Chamber was reached, and
the bare limestone floor lay exposed for a distance of 18 feet. Beyond

the centre another deposit presented itself, differing in character, not only
from the Breccia, but also from the less ancient ' Cave-earth,' being

more like the ordinary soil of cultivated ground, than either of them
there is no doubt, however, that it belonged to the Cave-earth era. It
was at first but a very thin layer, covered uniformly with a sheet of
' Granular Stalagmite,' no more than a few inches thick ; but, as the
work advanced eastward, both the stalagmite and the deposit it covered
became gradually thicker, never, however, attaining a depth of four feet,
so that the limestone floor of the Cavern was laid bare in every sec-

tion.

    In the right wall as one enters the Chamber, and about midway in its

length, there is a very narrow crevice or slit in the limestone extending
obliquely from the roof to the floor. It contained no mechanical deposit

of any kind ; but what may be called its lower wall was lined with a thin

sheet of stalagmite.

     The exploration of the Rocky Chamber occupied about four months,
but the labour was not repaid with the discovery of any specimen of ranch

value. It is satisfactory, however, to have certainly ascertained whether
or not the deposits there contained anything of interest. The ' finds '

met with were only five in number (Nos. 7,318 to 7,322), and may be

briefly described as below :

     No. 7,318. Part of the skull of a large Hyasna, and a detached left
upper sectorial tooth belonging to the same species, probably the same
individual ; found in contact with the bottom of the Granular Stalagmitic
Floor, September 12, 1879.

     No. 7,319. Relics of Hy^na, consisting of the right upper sectorial
tooth ; the molar immediately in front of it ; the crown of a canine tooth,
the three upper left incisors still in part of the jaw ; the right outer upper
incisor ; and a fragment of skull. The whole were found on September 16,
1879, at thebottomof the Granular Stalagmite, and were not improbably
portions of the individual represented by the ' find ' No. 7,318, from which
they were about two feet distant. No. 7,319, however, included a few
fragments of bone belonging to some smaller species.

   ANo. 7,320. piece of flint of nondescript form, from which several

flakes had been dislodged. It was 2-4 inches long, lv5 inch in greatest

breadth, 1 inch in greatest thickness, unrolled, the edges tolerably sharp,

apparently non-utilized, and having a chalky texture. It was found in
the fourth foot-level below the Granular Stalagmite, without any object of
interest near it, on September 25, 1879.

     No. 7,321. Skull of Sheep, with eight teeth, and an axis of probably

the same individual. Found November 27, 1879, lying on, but unattached

to, the sheet of stalagmite in the wall-crevice or slit mentioned above.

     No. 7,322. The two rami of lower jaw of Wolf (?) or Dog (?), found
November 27, 1879, embedded in, but not covered with the sheet of
stalagmite in the wall-crevice or slit mentioned above. One of them was

lying across the other, and together they contained twelve teeth, most of
them worn considerably.

   --Second, that is deeper, Excavation, in the Long Arcade. When the

Committee began the exploration in March 1865, it was decided to make

a first excavation from end to end, limited everywhere to the depth of
4 feet below the bottom of the Stalagmitic Floor ; on the completion of this,
to begin, at the entrance where gi'onnd was first broken, a second, that
is a deeper excavation, and proceed in the same order as before through
the entire Cavern. The first or 4-feet excavation was completed on Novem-

ber 27, 1879, when the exploration of the Rocky Chamber was finished.
Every chamber, and gallery, and recess large enough for a man to work

--in several of which bad been discovered during the progress of the work
--had been thoroughly excavated and explored, and the entire extent and

character of the Cavern to the depth just mentioned, was perfectly known
to the Superintendents, as well as to the workmen.

     Excepting the Rocky Chamber and portions of one or two small
narrow recesses, a limestone floor had nowhere been reached by the
excavators, so that it was impossible to say what was the extent and
character of the Cavern at lower depths, or what might be contained in

the deposits still occupying them.

     The Committee had by no means lost sight of the original idea of a
second, that is deeper, excavation ; nor were they unmindful of the fact
that the work would be incomplete without it; but, bearing in mind that
the exploration had already absorbed the continuous daily labour of nearly

--sixteen years, at a cost to the funds of the Association of 1,850Z. a result

--greatly in excess of the first rough estimate they came reluctantly to the

conclusion, during the meeting at Sheffield in 1879, that the time had
very nearly ari'ived for closing the work, and that they would apply for
but one further grant of no more than 50L, with the definite statement
that it was ' for the purpose oi finishing the exploration.'

     Though the Geological Section, to which it was at once communicated,
acquiesced in this conclusion, it called forth a strong and general expres-
sion of opinion that it was eminently desirable to lay bare the limestone
floor in at least some part of the Cavern, as well as to ascertain whether
or not the large mass of deposit still unexcavated contained any animal
relics or human industrial remains ; and Professor W. C. Williamson, of
Owens College, Manchester, suggested that subscriptions from private
sources might not improbably be made so as to carry on the work for at
least one additional year ; and he expressed the hope that the suggestion
would be kept in mind by the members of the Section, so that it might
have some practical issue at the meeting of the Association, at Swansea,

in 1880.

    As soon as the entire 4-feet excavation was finished, the Superinten-

dents, having a small portion of the 50Z. grant still in hand, resolved to
begin the deeper work, and for that purpose they selected a spot a little

within the outer or northern end of ' The Long Arcade ' (see ' Reps.
Brit. Assoc' 1872, pp. 44-47 ; 1873, pp. 198-207; 1874, pp. 3-6). This

spot had the advantages of being the lowest level reached in the previous

excavation, of ofifering many facilities for carrying on the work, and the
workmen would begin at once with the Breccia, or oldest known deposit,
in the Cavern-- all those of less antiquity having been there already re-
moved. The work was begun on November 28, 1879, the workmen, as
in the first excavation, digging their way daily farther and farther into

the Cavern.

     It having become known that only a very small sum remained in hand,

the following subscriptions from friends at a distance, as well as in the
neighbourhood, reached the Secretary from time to time :

larger tlian usual were, perhaps, somewliat more than commonly pre-

valent in the lowest levels ; but it still remains the fact that, so far as
is at present known, the Breccia is the oldest deposit found in the Cavern.

Pieces of Stalagmitic Floor, necessarily of still greater antiquity, pre-

sented themselves occasionally in the Breccia, a fact which had been fre-

quently observed  during  the  four-feet excavation                                                                                           but no  trace  of  the

On June 19, 1880, the Committee, having spent all the money placed

at their disposal by the General Committee of the Association, as well as
by their private friends, were under the necessity of suspending the work

and discharging the workmen. Nearly seven months had been spent on

the second or lower excavation, and though no more than eighteen ' finds '
(Nos. 7323 to 7840) had been met with, the following description of

them will show that the expenditiire of time and money had not been

quite in vain.

ANo 7323.       flint ' nodule-tool,' the butt end rudely an inequilateral

Whenquadrilateral, about 2"6 inches by 2 '3 inches, and almost quite flat.

standing on this as a base, the tool may be described as an oblique trian-

gular pyi-amid, its axis being at an oblique angle to the base. It attains

its greatest girth about 1'5 inch above the base, where it measures

9'7 inches. The faces of the pyramid are by no means planes, and no

two of them are of the same width. Their common vertex is a rather

blunt edge about '9 inch long, and their greatest widths 3'4 inches, 3*3

inches, and 1'5 inch. The extreme length of the tool is 5'9 inches.

Portions of the original surface of the nodule remain almost everywhere

around the butt end, and one face is completely covered with it except a

space within 1'5 inch of the vertex, whence one flake has been dislodged.

It was found alone, in the Breccia, in the eighth foot-level below the

Granular Stalagmitic Floor, on December 11, 1879.

  --No. 7324. Two flint specimens (Nos. t^jVt j WW)- ^O- tA* is a

nodule-tool, almost white, and having no remnant of the original surface

of the nodule. In outline it is rudely quadrilateral, about 2'1 inches long, '

the breadth at the ends being 1"2 inch and I'l inch ; its greatest thick-
ness is about '7 inch, which it attains near the broader end. One face

has a tendency to flatness, the other is convex, and has one principal

longitudinal ridge, and two or three minor ones. No. -t^w^ is a chip of
but little interest. The ' find ' occurred in the Breccia, in the fifth foot-

level below the Granular Stalagmitic Floor, where it was met with on

January 5, 1880.

   ANo. 7325. left last upper molar of Bear, a few pieces of bone, and a

not more than '2 inch thick. The tool was found alone on February 11,

1880, in the Breccia, in the eighth foot-level below the Granular Stalag-
mitic Floor. This specimen is peculiarly interesting, on account of a
remarkably well-developed ' bulb of percussion ' in one of the lateral
edges, about two inches from the butt end. It was found alone, in the
Breccia, in the eighth foot-level below the Gi*anular Stalagiaiitic Floor, on

June 2, 1880.

use.

having been used as a ' hammer stone ' are neither numerous nor well-

pronounced. It was found alone, in the Breccia, in the sixth foot-level

below the Granular Stalagmitic Floor, on April 13, 1880.

that is the fourth day before the suspension of the work.

    It may not be out of place to remark here that the second, that is the
deeper, excavation has yielded a greater number of archaeological than of

palseontological ' finds ' ; and that whilst no animal relic was found below

the seventh foot-level, the three fine nodule-tools (Nos. 7323, 7328, 7339)
were found in the eighth foot-level, and several flint chips occurred in the

ninth or lowest.

In closing their Report the Committee beg to express their thanks to

Lord Haldon for so freely and kindly allowing them the entire control of

the Cavern whilst carrying on the  exploration                                                                to the  Committee of the

Geological Section for their uniform, firm, and most encouraging support

to the General Committee of the Association for their liberal annual

grants during a period of sixteen years, which have resulted in an instance

of Cavern-exploration without parallel, it is believed, in this or any other

country, for, at least, its continuity and duration ; and to the private

friends whose timely and kind donations enabled a considerable and satis-

factory deeper excavation to be made, and thereby to give the work a

nearer approach to completeness than would otherwise Jiave been the

case.

     Finally, the Superintendents feel that it would be less than just were

they to fail on this occasion to state, not merely the satisfaction, but the
admiration with which they review the manner in which the work has

been done by George Smerdon and his co-labourers in the Cavern. From

-- --the first day of the exploration March 28, 1865 to its suspension on

June 19, 1880, Smerdon was continuously engaged on the work, and for
nearly thirteen years he was the foreman. During the entire period he
not merely discharged his duties in a most faithful manner, but he never

had a misunderstanding with the Superintendents.

   sauries from the Lias of England and Wurtemherg, by a Com-

Minute Ichthyosaurian skeletons found in the Lias have, from time to
time, raised a suspicion that the young of Ichthyosaurus might possibly
pass in their development through a tadpole stage, since the smallest speci-
mens show no indication of limbs. Prof. Haughton, in his ' Manual of
Geology ' (2nd edit. 1866, p. 272, fig. 37), has figured a small individual of

Athis kind from the Lias of Boll. less perfect specimen, 9 inches long, from

the Lias of Charm outh, preserved in the Woodwardian Museum, is devoid of
all traces of limbs. These small specimens, like the young of all vertebrate
animals, are characterised by the relatively large size of the head. This
uncertainty as to the mode of reproduction of Ichthyosaurus, has perhaps
received some countenance from the circumstance that Prof. Owen, in his

· Anatomy of the Vertebrates ' so far hesitated about the true nature and
classification of Ichthyosaurs as to speak of them in one place (vol. i. p.
50) as Dipnoa, although as a rule they are arranged with the Monopnoa.
So far as I can learn, there is no evidence in support of Prof. Haughton's

hypothesis that Ichthyosaurs pass through a metamorphosis. _ But, on the

conti-ary, a number of examples, British and foreign, enforce a conviction
that several species of the genus brought forth their young alive. In all
cases they appear to have been retained in the body of the parent till a
compai-atively large size had been reached. Attention was first drawn to
this characteristic of the genus by the late Dr. Chaning Pearce, of Bath,
who, in 1846, contributed to the 17th volume of the ' Annals of Natural
History,' a paper entitled ' Notice of what appears to be the Embryo of

an Ichthyosaurus in the pelvic cavity of I. communis.' In his note it is
stated that the large animal from the Lias of Somerset is about eight and a

half feet long. The little animal lies at full length in the pelvis, with its
head directed towards the tail of the large one, and is supported upon the

internal surface of its integument and upon the internal sui'faces of three
posterior ribs of the left side. The young animal measured five and a half

inches in length. The rami of the jaws and one of the longest ribs, of
which only five or six are visible, are each an inch long ; and of the thirty
vertebrae which can be counted the largest measures an eighth of an inch

in its longest diameter.

     This minute specimen is bounded on each side by the ilium, ischium,
and pubis, and by the right and left posterior paddles, and on the right
side by the vertebral column and ribs which extend from it. The pos-

terior two-thirds of the little animal is within the pelvis, but the head

appears to protrude beyond it, and was apparently in the act of being
expelled at the time of death. The late Dr. Chaning Pearce remarks on
the correct position of this minute skeleton in the pelvis between the right

and left ribs, with the head protruding ; and from the exact correspondence

between its bones and those of the large Saurian draws the inference that

it can only be a foetal Ichthyosaurus. During the meeting of the Biitish

Association in Bath in 18G4, it was my good fortune to have an oppor-
tunity of studying this specimen, and it enforced in my mind the same

inference that was enunciated by its discoverer. Its perfect condition of

preservation, size, and position in the body seem to me completely to
refute the current opinion of those days when Dr. Pearce's conclusions

Avere not accepted, that the young animal might have been swallowed

whole, and have gradually found its way to the position in which it

was fossilized. This view Dr. Chaning Pearce combated by remarking

that had so delicate a structure been swallowed whole it could not have

reached its present place without being dissolved by the gastric juice.

    Among the series of Ichthyosaurs presented to the Woodwardian

Museum, by Thomas Hawkins, Esq., is a large slab with the remains im-
perfectly preserved, but containing a disturbed skeleton of a young Ich-

thyosaur in the pelvic region. The vertebral column has the vertebree in
sequence, and the head is remarkable for the high form common in embryos
(fig. 1). Taken by itself no inference as to the mode of reproduction

could fairly be drawn from this fossil, but as a link in a chain of evidence

Ait has some value.  third British specimen is said to have occurred in

the Lias of Lyme Regis, and to have shown a number of embryos in the

pelvic cavity. I have not seen this specimen, but Mr. Henry Keeping, who

first reported its existence to me, considered that it was altogether incon-
70 REPORT 1880.

elusive upon the mode of reproduction of the Ichthyosaurus. Mr. Charles
Moore has examined the specimen and is doubtful as to the inference that
should be drawn from it. These are the only British specimens which
bear upon the mode of reproduction in Ichthyosaurs.

    I am aware that it may be fallacious to reason from the structures

of living reptiles back to the nature of soft parts in an Ichthyosaurus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

but in the alligator, which is also a carnivorous animal, the contents
of the stomach remain there till perfectly dissolved, and in a specimen
11 feet long, the pyloric aperture was only about an inch in diameter, and
defended with two valvular constrictions, so that, supposing the Ich-

thyosaurs to have preyed on their own species, and to have swallowed their
prey head first, after the manner of snakes, there is an a priori impro-

bability that the young animal would have got farther than the stomach,
which in alligators is placed well forward, and is not unduly large. More-
over, I see no reason to doubt that the substances from the Lias of the South
of England which are well known as Ichthyosaurian coprolites have been
correctly determined. They consist of well-digested materials, and
sometimes contain the scales of ganoid fishes, and hooks of cuttles, such

as are met with in the stomachic region of many individual Ichthyosaurs.

I have elsewhere taken occasion to point out that the spiral structure
which these coprolites display indicates that there was, anterior to the

rectum, a smaller intestine of the calibre of the coil which is wound into
the coprolite ; ' and it is obviously impossible, even if the young specimen

could have passed the stomach uninjured, for it to have passed uninjured

down such a small tube, so that the snout should project from the body
in the way which Dr. Chaning Pearce has described.

     Unfortunately Dr. Chaning Pearce did not give a figure of his
specimen, and so the discovery missed alike recognition and recollection.

I lost sight of the specimen until last year, when I learned that it had
been removed to Brixton, and with the rest of the collection it was shown

to me by Dr. Joseph Chaning Pearce, F.G.S. But whether pyrites in it

had decayed, or whether it had suffered in the lapse of years from cleaning
and removal, the fact remains that the young specimen is gone. The ques-
tion here ends in a cul-de-sac, so far as the English evidence is concerned.

    An interesting Ichthyosanr in the Royal Museum at Stuttgart, to
which my attention was drawn by Dr. Oscar Fraas, in August, 1878,

would appear to have been the original of a figure by Dr. G. F. von Jaeger,

published in 1824, in his work ' De Ichthyosauri sive Proteosauri, &c.,'

which I have hitherto been unable to see.

     It is certainly the original of a very rough figure, Tab. I. fig. 4, pro-
bably the same plate, given by Dr. von Jaeger in his work, ' Ueber fossile
Reptilien welche in Wiirtemberg aufgefunden worden sind,' published
at Stuttgart, in 1828. But although the young animal is figured as lying
in the abdominal cavity of the large individual, the author does not even
refer to its remarkable position, and confines his observations to an account
of the structure of the genus, and an endeavour to determine the species.

And it was not till Dr. Chaning Pearce's note became known in Germany

that attention was awakened to the bearing of this and of some similar

specimens.

      Other writings of Dr. Jaeger contain evidences of his renewed interest

in this subject, for in the 'Nova Acta Ces. Leop. Car.' vol. xxv. pt. 3. p. 961,

 Tiibingen ; and the third from Zell, near Kirchheim, was exhibited at

 Munich in 1864. He remarks that these are all entirely enclosed between

 the ribs of the parent, are all fully developed, and were ready to be born,
 or in the act of being born, as the animals sank to the bottom. ' In these
 three cases the head, though still in the body of the old animal, is directed

backward. On the other hand, one specimen of Ichthyosaurus from
Ohm den, now at Madrid, has the head of the young one directed forward,

and in sequence with a connected series of vertebras.' Jaeger argues
that the young do not exhibit any trace of having been eaten, since no

 digested matter is found with them, while the vei'tebrte are in sequence,
and the bones hold the exact position they should have if the Ichthyo-

saui'us were viviparous. And he further remarks, that though these
yoting examples are rare, yet they really exist, while we find no traces of

any eggs, though numerous coprolites are preserved ; and from the cir-
cumstance that the skull in the young of these German specimens belongs

to the same species as the old aaimals, concludes that, at least, the
species which he names Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris was vi\4parous.

      Other important and beautiful specimens have been acquired for the

University Museum at Tubingen, by Professor F. A. von Quenstedt^

F.M.Gr.S., and admirably developed by him. They are briefly noticed in
his well-known works, ' Der Jura ' and ' Epochen der Natur,' but they

led the learned and accomplished author to the conclusion that the young-
specimens had been devoured. In the former work (1858, p. 219), after
describing the species, which he names J. quadriscissus, it is observed,
* this specimen contains a young one between the ribs, in a position which
indicates that it was eaten. The splendidly preserved skull of the young
one measures 10 inches in length, with its point towards the hinder extre-

mity, while its tail still remains in the throat. Hence we may infer that
the intestinal canal was as simple as in sharks.' And in the later work,,

published in 1861, p. 549, these statements are repeated, except that two
specimens are mentioned as being in the Tubingen collection. Though no
argument is offered upon the subject, the large size of the young, and

extent to which its tail reaches forward in one of his specimens, has

evidently weighed with the Tiibingen professor in the printed expression

of his judgment. He, however, called my attention to a small specimen in

the University Museum, with the tail coiled up, which he thought might

have been foetal, but it is not contained in the body of another animal.

In 1876, Arnold R. 0. Wurstemberger printed in the ' Jahreshefte

Ver. Nat. Wiirtemburg,' a memoir entitled ' Ueber Lias Epsilon,' which

concludes with some account of the species of Ichthyosaurus, giving

an interesting description of I. quadriscissus (Q). After describing a

large parent animal, in which the head is said to be 50 cm. long, and

the vertebral column 240 cm. in length, Wurstemberger observes that

the stomach lies unusually far forward, being only 20 cm, behind the-

head, and is defined by containing fish-bones and the dark-coloured

Aremains of cuttle-fish.  small Ichthyosaur lies entirely behind this

region, and is so contained between the ribs, that the author is convinced

that it could not have got there after the death of the large animal, hence

it can only have been eaten or be an embryo. Many bones of the young

animal are scattered, and appear to have been washed out of the large

animal, but are always on the ventral side. The entire animal is a good

deal confused, so that the co-ordination and order of the parts can only be
made out after careful study. The bones of the young animal, fi'om being

less mineralised than those of the large individual, are much softer. The

largest ve^rtebra is about 4 m.m. in diameter, so that, reckoning sixty

vertebrae, the author estimates the length of the vertebral column of the

small animal at 24 cm. The head is not only entire, but shows the

suttires between the bones. The sclerotic plates form the usual circles

defending the eyes. The jaws show no traces of teeth, and from their

excellent preservation Wurstemberger inferred that none existed. It is,

however, he says, most remarkable that the snout is not turned towards

the hinder part of the large animal but towards its head, and the vertebral

columns are parallel to each other. This specimen I have not been able

to examine, and no figure of it has been published ; but although appa-

rently less well preserved than some others, I believe it to be embryonic,

and that the position of the young animal may possibly have been the cause

of death in the parent. For, after the author's account of the unusually

forward position and contents of the stomach, I do not accept his doubts

as to whether the specimen really justifies the embryonic hypothesis, in

face of the cumulative evidence that at least six specimens are known

which each demonstrates the same fact of the presence of a young Ichthyo-

saur, in good preservation, in the posterior abdominal region of the

large specimens.

Finally, just as I was leaving Tiibingen, Herr Kocker, Professor

Quenstedt's obliging and excellent assistant, mentioned to me that there

is at present at Reutlingen for sale an Ichthyosaurus, which is alleged to

contain several young specimens in various stages of development. Being

unable to go to see this specimen, I obtained a photograph of it, but

unfortunately the animal appears to have lain upon its back and side, in

such a position that the ribs of the upper side of the body have fallen

together, leaving the abdominal cavity exposed. Beyond all doubt, there

are the remains of several small Ichthyosaurs in and about the hinder

abdominal region, but their condition is not so clear as in other specimens,
and the circumstance derives its chief weight from being a link in a chain

of evidence, and its interest from repeating a condition shown by the Lyme

Regis specimen referred to.

Of all this material no illustration has been given excepting the rough

and almost worthless figure by Dr. von Jaeger, published between fifty
and sixty years ago. I am, therefore, glad to be able, by the kind co-opera-

tion of Dr. Oscar Fraas, to submit a photograph (of which Plate I. is a

copy) of this the earUest found example illustrating the relation of the

young to the parent Ichthyosaur.

    I am also greatly indebted to Prof, von Quenstedt for having allowed
me to have photographs made of the two most striking specimens in the
University Museum of Tiibingen. Hence these three figures will enable
those to whom the originals may be inaccessible to judge of the nature and

value of the evidence to which I have already referred. It may, however,

be useful if I append a few descriptive notes on the characters of the

specimens. The determination of the species I purposely leave for a

memoir, in which I trust to give a systematic revision and determination

of the British and foreign Ichthyosaurs                                                                                                                                                                            and this subject is so beset with
                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

 can be defined with the same accuracy and certainty as characterises
other kinds of palisontological work.

     The specimen in the Royal Museum at Stuttgart (fig. 4) wants the

head and the hinder half of the tail, in which the vertebrje become greatly
 attenuated. The portion of the animal preserved is aboiit 5 feet long, and
 of this length rather less than two- thirds is comprised by the body region
 of the animal, in which dorsal ribs are developed. The fore limb lies some-
what bent on the ventral margins of the ribs, and the hind limb is well

preserved below the pelvic region. From the apparently firm union of the
ribs to the dorsal centrums they have been pulled somewhat apart, and do
not approximate towards their ventral edges. This animal lies upon its
left side, inclining a little towards the back. As usual there is an upward
arch of the anterior half of the dorsal region. The young animal lies in

the abdominal cavity, and, although not perhaps so fully developed as

might be, its length, so far as can be made out, appears to be about
2 feet 6 inches. The vertebral column is parallel to the vertebral column
of the large animal, and is separated from it by an interspace of 2^ inches in
the posterior region of the large animal, becoming anteriorly a little farther
distant from it. The young animal lies upon its right side, and although the
ribs have been strained from their natural position, the young animal is
still entirely between the ribs, except where a few of them have been
purposely removed, the better to show its characters. The head of the
small animal is about 10 inches long, and rather more than 2^ inches
deep at the hinder border of the orbit. The snout projects from the

abdominal cavity in the region of the pelvic bones for about a third of its
length, but the pelvic bones are no longer in situ, owing to the conditions

of fossilisation. The dorsal region of the young specimen has not been
so developed as to show its ribs, but the vertebral column is in sequence,
though the pressure of the overlying ribs of the large animal has some-
what broken the chain, and exposed the faces of one or two of the few
vertebrae, the lai'gest of which in the lower dorsal region has a diameter
of half an inch. The depth of the body of the young animal was appa-
rently 4^ inches. The extremity of the tail is not seen. It may be noticed
that the ribs of the lai'ge animal extend over the eye and nasal region of
the left side of the young head, but the shortening of the ribs on the left
side of the large animal shows that the snout could hardly have been con-
tained entirely within the pelvic cavity if the young animal occupied its
present position during life. It is of course jjossible that there may have
been some slight shifting of position ; but the presence of the abdominal

ribs of the large animal in situ, and the generally undisturbed character of

the remains, lead me to believe that the relative positions of the two indi-
viduals are not now greatly difi'erent from what they were during life.

    I can only endorse the conclusions of Von Jaeger that we have here a

fcetus in the act of being expelled, and although the size of the young
animal is relatively large, it is not unparalleled among living amphibians ;
and the eggs of birds vary so much in bulk, that with gigantic eggs, such
as those of .(3Epiornis, the large size of this embryo is not unexampled.
The great extension of the young in the body of the parent need perhaps
present no difficulty when we remember the large space occupied by the
ovarian organs in the lowgr vertebrata; and, large as the young animal is,
there is no known limit to the capacity for expansion of the oviduct which
would render its size and position improbable on such an explanation. If
it were asked why the old animal should have died, I can only state that
74 REPORT 1880.

it has been my fortune to dissect a porpoise in which the foetus was simi-

larly placed, and the parent animal was driven ashore in an obviously

enfeebled condition, consequent probably upon the function in which it

was engaged, and if such a specimen had been fossilised it would have

exactly paralleled these fossil Ichthyosaurs.

    The specimens in the Tiibingen Museum (figs. 3, 4,) are in some respects

more instructive since the heads of the parent animals are preserved, the

ribs are less disturbed, and the skeletons are altogether more complete. The

specimen exhibited in the Museum, which is from Holzmaden in Wiirtem-

berg, is numbered 7532. The parent animal has the skull-bones somewhat

U^displaced they are about                           inches long, while the length of the vertebral
                                                  ;

colunan is 8 feet 3^ inches, the fore limb is 16 inches long, and the

hind limb 8^ inches in length. In the dorsal region there are forty

vertebrae with double-headed ribs ; then follow six with single-headed ribs,

and in about this position the ilium was placed. The caudal vertebrae

number ] 06. The length of the abdominal region of the large animal is

3 feet 6 inches. The iliac bones are relatively large, flattened, and oblong,

and measure 3| inches in length. They have been a little displaced, so

that the hinder limbs lie just below the vertebral column.

Entirely within the abdomen is a small Ichthyosaur, lying between the

right and left ribs, with its head directed towards the posterior region of

the body, the extremity of the snout being separated from the present

position of the iliac bones by a width of about five vertebras. The verte-

bral column of the small animal is parallel to that of the large one in

which it is contained. The head, which is well preserved, is 10^ inches

long, has teeth in both jaws, has the eye-plates well developed, and the

orbital cavity abovit 2 inches in length. The region of the fore limb is

missing, owing- apparently to a fracture of the fossil in extracting it in

the quarry. The dorsal vertebra and dorsal ribs are well shown. The

centrums here have a diameter of 1 inch. The vertebral column can be

traced within the large animal for 21 inches, but the series is a little

scattered, and towards the end the vertebra are obscure from their small
size. The interspace between the two vertebral columns is only about

2 inches ; the depth of the body of the large animal was probably about

28 inches. It is to be remarked that there is no indication that I could

detect of the tail of the small specimen reaching so far forward as to

justify the expression that it was in the throat.
     The second Tiibingen specimen is contained in the work-room, and

has no catalogue number.

It is of much larger size, has the dorsal vertebrae and ribs in natural

position, but the hind limbs do not appear to be 23resent, though the iliac

bones remain, slightly displaced. The skull is here 24 inches long. There

are 45 vertebras, with double-headed ribs, measuring, as preserved, 4 feet.

To them succeed two vertebra?, with large single tubercles, which are

usually regarded as sacral ; then 31 vertebrae, measuring 2 feet 8 inches,

which form the large anterior part of the tail ; and then succeed 47 ver-

tebrae of much smaller size ; but the extremity of the tail is not preserved.
The abdominal ribs are not well seen, but the depth of the body is about
25 inches. The fore limb in this animal is 13| inches long. From these

and other considerations, which it is not withia my present province to

dwell upon, it is evident that we have here a distinct species from the

specimen just described. The young animal lies entirely between the

ribs of the large one in the posterior part of the abdomen, with its back
ON THE BEPEODUCTION OP CERTAIN SPECIES OF ICHTHYOSAmUS. 75

towards that of the large individual in which it is contained, as is the
case with the other specimens which I have described. The head is

directed downwards, and the snout extends beyond the limits of the ribs,

as though it were just protruding from the body. The extremity of the
snout is imperfect, but the head, as preserved, is 9 inches long. The ver-

tebral column has a total lengtKseeu of 20 inches, but may extend further

under a rib. The vertebras are in natural sequence, though the caudal

region is bent round in a curve veutrally ; but it is difficult to say whether
this is the position natural to the embryo. The dorsal vertebris are ^-inch

in diameter, and the corresponding centrums of the large animal are

2^ inches in diameter. The ribs of the young animal are preserved, and
there are bones which appear to be coracoids. The hind limb is distinctly

preserved, and measures 1^ inch in length. The femur is |-inch long, and
the smaller limb-bones are in three rows. It is unfortunate that the hind

limb of the parent is not available for comparison, but that portion of
the original slab is missing. So far as it is possible to compare the

pointed snout and teeth of the young with the large animal, there is

nothing to suggest that they belong to different species.

     After thus detailing the facts as to the position and character of these

specimens, the conclusion to be drawn from them may be left to a con-

sideration of the cumulative evidence of the figures ; and if I do not for-

mally discuss the view which Prof. Quenstedt has adopted, that these

specimens were eaten, it is because no other animals except Ichthyosaurs

have ever been found in the hinder part of the abdominal cavity of large

.specimens of this genus and because the remains of fishes and cuttles,
                                                                                                                                    ;

which appear to have constituted the ordinary food of these sea-monsters,

are always found, comminuted and indistinguishable in form, in a more

anterior position. It is improbable that the large animal, with its com-

paratively firm quadrate bones, would have been capable of swallowing

a creature in which the head, as in the first Tiibingen specimen, was
more than two-thirds the length of its own head, without in any way

crushing or breaking the structure, or even disarranging an eye-plate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

while the evidence from the structure of coprolites seems to me to render

superfluous any further discussion of this question of the young animals

being in process of digestion. That the small specimens were washed in

a dead state into the already dead bodies of the large specimens is a

hypothesis that can need no discussion ; for the many cases in which the

two bodies are parallel, with the smaller placed entirely within the larger,

have no appearance of accident, while a movement of the sea which would

wash the young about in such a way would probably scatter the bones of

both animals.

I therefore submit that the evidence indicates that these Ichthyosaurs

were viviparous, and were probably produced of different relative bulk

in different  species                                   and  it  may  be  from feeble  health  of the  parent
                                                     ;

or from some accident of position in the young that they were not

produced alive, and thus have left a record of their method of reproduc-

tion to which no allied extinct group of animals has shown a parallel.

There is some evidence that in certain cases many young were produced

at a birth, and although the specimens are not in the best state of preser-

vation, analogy strongly suggests that this is a distinctive character of

certain species. It cannot be taken as proved that all Ichthyosaurs were

viviparous ; for the character, though met with among fishes, amphibians,
and reptiles, is not distinctive of any living order of these animals ; and it
                                               --

76 REPORT-- 1880.

is therefore probable that many species in this extinct ordinal group
produced their young from eggs, like the majority of their living allies.

    I would express my thanks to the Council of the Eoyal Society for

assistance in examining the museums of Europe in which remains of

Icbthyosaurs are contained ; as well as to Dr. Fraas, Prof. Quenstedt,and

Prof. McK. Hughes, for the facilities so. freely aiforded me for studying

the specimens in the collections over which they preside.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor P. M. Dukcan and

   Mr. Gr. E. Vine, appointed for the purpose of reporting on the

   Carboniferous Polyzoa. Drawn up by Mr. Vine (Secretary).

--As so much remains to be done before the Pateozoic Polyzoa can be

properly classified more particularly the Carboniferous fepecies-- it seems

to me that the wisest course to adopt in this Report, is to go carefully

over the work of other authors, reviewing their labours generally, and
giving, in as condensed a form as possible, th.e results of their varied

efforts.

     David Ure,' the son of a working weaver in Glasgow, is the first, so

far as I am aware, who drew attention by figures to British Carboniferous

Polyzoa ; and Martin ^ gives some good figures of Zoophyta, but species
of these belong to both the Corals and Polyzoa. Thirty.'five years after
the publication of Ure's work. Dr. Fleming^ named some of the species
figured, and the Zoophyta he called Gellepora TJrii and Eetepora elongata.
The first of these, according to Mr. Robert Etheridge, Jun.,* is Ghcetetes
tumidus, Phillips, and the other is a Fenestella.

     In 1826, the work of August Goldfuss* was published. In this a
system of nomenclature was adopted, and many figures of Polyzoa and
Corals given, which to a large extent assisted investigators and helped
them to identify species found in this country. The generic terms used
by Goldfuss were accepted by authors who followed him, but as no dis-
tinction was made by the earlier investigator in separating true Polyzoa
from true Corals, those who worked from his types and descriptions fell into
his error, and mingled, for a time, Corals and Polyzoa together whenever
they had fresh forms to describe.

     The chief of the generic terms used by Goldfuss were :

                                         1. Gorgonia, Linnteus, 1745.

                                   2. Gellepora, Gmelin, 1788?

                                    3. Betepora, Lamarck, 1816.

                                        4. Geriopora, Goldfuss, 1826.

      The type of Linneeus' Gorgonia was altogether different from the types
 of Goldfuss's genus. The first had reference to the fixed Polypiferous

mass -whicli are still known by the same name, but the last are now

referred to the Fenestellidce.

    The species of CeUepora are now placed with Chceteies, and most,

if not all, of the Ccriopora of the Palasozoic era are also referred to

Chceteies and to Alveolites.
     The use of the term Betepora, as applied to Palseozoic fauna, has been

abandoned, and the better defined generic term Fenestella used instead
but Lonsdale,^ in his otherwise clearly defined characters of this genus,
included both Fenestella and Polypora types in the one description of the

genus.

     However we may differ, at the present time, from Mr. John Phillips^

in his arrangement of the ' Zoophyta ' found in the Carboniferous rocks

of Yorkshire, we must give him the credit for being amongst the first

to attempt a division between Corals and Polyzoa ; but in the use of
Lamarck's genus Millepora for some of his species, he seems to have
been very undecided as to the true character of his fossils.

      Phillips describes eight species of Betepora defining certain terms

--which he uses, such as fenestmles, dissepiments, and interstices terms

still used in later descriptions of Fenestella. His species were B. mein-

 branacea, flahellata, tenuifila, imdulata, irregularis, polyporata, nodulosa,

and laxa. The poverty of Phillips' diagnosis renders identification of
his species a very diflBcult matter, but some of his species were so truly
 typical in their general, as well as in their minute characters, as to enable

Mr. G. W. Shrubsole, in his elaborate review of the Fenestellidce,^ to

 retain three of them as types of his very restricted Carboniferous forms.
 The retained species are :

         Fenestella memhranacea, Svno. <   -0'  ^ 7 ?V ^

                                 ' ·'  (^  F.   flahellata  ,,

         ,, nodulosa, Phill.

                         ,, polyporata ,,

     The Betepora fltistriformis, Phill. has been placed as a synonym of F.

plebeia, M'Coy, by Mr. Shrubsole,'* and as Ptylopora by Morris.^ By

Phillips it was regarded as the Millepora flustriformis^ of Martyn, and he

also said it resembled the Oorgonia antiqua of Goldfuss. Betepwa pluma,

Phill., is now Olauconome ; and Flustra ? parallela, which Phillips describes

as ' Linear : longitudinally and deeply furrowed, cells in the furrows, in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           '

--quincunx, their apertures oval, prominent " M'Coy * refei's to the

genus Vincularia, Defranc, and Morris ^ places it and another species of

M'Coy's with the genus Sulcoretepora, D'Orb. This species has no afiinities

with any of these genera ; it appears to me to be the Carboniferous de-

scendant of the more ancient Ptilodicfa, Lonsd. (= Stidopora, Hall).

The non-cellnliferous, striated, sometimes rugose margin, and the central

laminar axis, or septum, which divides the cells of opposite sides, are

Ptilodicta Meeki, Nicholson, Devonian species/ as well as all the known

species of Sulcoretepora of the Garb. Limest. series.

     The Millepora of Lamarck seems to have been the generic type of both

Goldfuss and Phillips, and in describing the Carboniferous species, the

latter author adopted the class Polyparia of the Radiate Division of the

Animal kingdom at that time current among naturalists. It was

Phillips' misfortune, rather than his fault, that he had to follow in his

classification the authority of those who preceded him. Of the six

species of Millepora described, four are easily identified ; the other two

are not so easily recognised.

like this appears at Florence Court, Ireland.'

    No group of Polyzoa, recent or fossil,^ has caused so much trouble
to Palaeontologists as the little group here tabulated from Phillips. Mem-

bers of it have been referred to no fewer than five distinct genera, and

even now they may be safely referred to three, if not to four. Rather

than postpone the analysis of the species, I shall prefer to draw upon

later work and do it here instead of elsewhere.
     Millepora gracilis is referred to by Phillips in his later work,* for he

seems not to have noticed it in the limestone, Toredale limest., or shales of

Yorkshire yet it is most common from everywhere, whilst the M. rhom-

himself, that the species I am dealing with, were his; for in a letter

which he addressed to the Messrs. Young of Glasgow, he says, ' I agree

with you in referring your beautiful specimens to the three species (M.

gracilis, M. rhombifera, and M. interporosa) named in my books ('· York-

shire," vol. ii. and " Palseozoic Fos."). Your examples are better than

--mine were ; but I have no doubt of the reference, &c.' Morris places the

whole of Phillips' species with the exception of M. spicularis and M.

--oculata with the Geriopora,^ the exceptions, for what reason I cannot

explain, he places with the Pustulopera of Blainville, a genus that had no

existence in the Palaeozoic seas.

  --For these two species, the Messrs. Young of Glasgow have founded a

new genus Rhahdomeson on account of the peculiar central hollow axis

--which they possess, and on which the ceUs are arranged. This peculiarity

is unique for I know of no other Polyzoa having a rod or mesial axis

similar to these. Some of the Graptoloidea, sub-order, Bhahdophora,

--Allman, possess a mesial axis, and so do the Bhabdopleura class Polyzoa,
--order Phylactolemata but whether we should be justified in assuming on

this account, either Hydroid or Phylactolematous affinities for these

fossils is a very serious question to decide. The assumption in either case

would involve the discussion of many problems into which I cannot enter

here. The Messrs. Young, in the two papers referred to, have gone into

the question very fairly, and those who follow them in their critical

remarks must remember that they are contending for the antiquity of a

-- --type of Polyzoa organisation not previous to their discoveries known

to exist in a fossil state. I have carefully followed the authors in all

their investigations of this intricate question, but I am not prepared to

use this fossil type as in any way indicative of the existence of Phylacto-

lematous Polyzoa in Carboniferous times. At the same time it would be

mere carping on my part to ignore its existence as indicative of peculiar

structural characters that may help us in our future classification of the

Palaeozoic Polyzoa.

This species is a very variable one, Phillips speaks of it as having

' oval  pores,'  whilst the                                        Millepora  similis  has     more    elongated pores                                                                        on

the other hand Vincularia Binniei is spoken of as having ' oval to hexa-

gonal cells arranged in quincunx ; or in oblique ascending lines.' The

magnified figure of a sei-ies of cells given by Mr. Etheridge as an illustration

of his species, is one of the rarer varieties of M. interporosa. Had Mr.

Etheridge contended for the variety, I should not have disputed his claim,

but as he introduces a most anomalous genus into the classification of our

Carboniferous Polyzoa, I cannot do otherwise than point out the anomaly.

Defranc's genus Vincularia had no existence whatever in Palteozoic                                                                                                                                /^

reliable on this point.^

     It is on account of their importance that I have dwelt so fully upon
these species. They had a wide geographical range in Carboniferous

times, and though their variability is great, they have many structural
characters in common with the Ceriopera which range into the Mesozoic

and Tertiary strata.

     Under the auspices of Sir Richard Griffiths, of the Irish Geological
Survey, Frederick M'Coy published his ' Synopsis.' * There is ample evi-
dence in this work that M'Coy had much better material than Phillips, and

Lis drawings and diagnosis of species are more elaborate. M'Coy adds no
fewer than tweh^e species of Fenestella to our British Polyzoa. They are

F. pleheia, carinata, formosa, crassa, viuUiporata, ejuncida, frutex, hemisphe-

rica, Morrisii, oculaia, qiiadridecimalis, and varicosa. As I shall have to

speak of these farther on, I will leave the list without any further comment.
     M'Coy retains a few puzzling forms under the name of Gorgonia. These

are O. assimilis, Lonsd. ; G. Lonsdaleina, M'Coy ; and G. zic-zic, M'Coy.
     Another fenestrate genus, introduced by M'Coy, bears the name of

Ptylopora. There is a feather-like arrangement in this genus : a central
stem giving off lateral branches which are connected by dissepiments
having oval fenestrules. Fenestella owes its expansion to the bifurcation
of its branches. Ftylopora very rarely bifurcates, there is a basal exten-

sion of the Polyzoary along the central stem. One species is recorded by

-- --M'Coy P. fhmia but it is a genus that deserves to be more closely

studied than it has been. In naming some fossils lately for Mr. John
Aitken, F.G.S., from the neighbourhood of Castleton, Derbyshire, I
detected several small fragments of this beautiful genus. The broad
central stem, whenever fenestration was absent, might easily be mistaken

for a robust Glauconome.

     The Glauconomes, which M'Coy figures and gives a description of, are
G. grandis, G. gracilis, and by his discoveries he extends the range of

Phillips' G. Ufinnata}
     The Vincidaria I have already repudiated, and the V. parallela, Phill.,

which M'Coy accepts as a type, I have alluded to when describing

=Phillips' species. The Berenicea megastoma, M'Coy Biastopora, Mor.

Cat., will be placed in the genus Ceramopora on account of its many well-

marked characters.'^
    Having all the material at hand for the work, I sball now discuss the

relative value of the genera and species introduced by various authors
since the publication of the volumes alluded to.

        1877. Synocladia ? scotica, Toung and Young.^

     The type of this genus is very peculiar, and as it is well illustrated in
King's Permian Fossils, once seen it can hardly ever be forgotten. ' The

corallum is cup-shaped, with a small central root-like base : reticulated,
composed of rounded narrow, often branched interstices, bearing on the
inner face from three to five alternating longitudinal rows of prominent
edged pores, separated by narrow keels, studded with small irregidar

vesicles alternating v/ith the cell pores.' The essential characters of this

genus I have underlined.
     In the 'Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist.,'^ Mr. Robert Btheridge, Jan.,

described a ' peculiar polyzoon from the Lower Limestone Series of

Gilmerton, under the name of Synocladia carhonaria.' An almost identical

form had been previously referred, by Mr. Meek,' to Synocladia hiseriaUs,

--Mr. King, Mr. Etheridge says, ' I Lave ascertained that our Scotcli fossil

agrees so closely in its main characters ' with the American species,

' that it can be only regarded as a variety of it.' '

    To Si/nocladia hiserialis Mr. Meek also refers Septopora cestriensis, Prout,

' a form which appears to differ only from the typical species of Synocladia
by having from one to four rows of cell- apertures on the dissepiment

instead of two.' ^

     In 1878, Prof. Young and Mr. John Yonng published ^ details oE

another Synocladia, which they called Synocladia (?) scotica from the
Upper Limestone Shales, Gillfoot and Grarple Burn stating that ' in both

localities it is very rare.' If we accept the depai'ture from the original
type of Synocladia, which I have no objection to, seeing that Prof. King

nses the term for Palaeozoic Polyzoa alone, then these two species of the

genus may be recorded as existing in Carboniferous times. They have

the ' small irregular vesicles alternating with the pores,' not unique with
this genus, for several others contain a ' secondary pore.' Having exam-

ined this secondary pore in thin sections of Carb. species, I can only

account for its presence as being indicative of the existence of a vibra-
cula in these ancient types. There are, however, most essentially definite

characters in the Carb. Synocladia yet to be accounted for. Very fre-

quently, in even the smallest fragments, pores, similar to the secondary

pores on the face, are constantly found on the reverse also. I know of
no analogy in more recent fossil or living species to which I can refer to

account for this feature in this ancient type.

margins (of the cells) in the present form are decidedly raised and promi-

nent, might it not probably be a species of Thamniscus ? If it be a now

species of Polypora, I would propose for it the specific designation of

P. pustulata.' ^

wise, but younger and less cautious observers, on the strength of the manj'

peculiar affinities which this species has to Hornera, would have eagerly

embraced this opportunity. I cannot, however, regard this species as a

Palseozoic Hornera, but I must candidly confess that it comes very near to

the generic description accepted by Busk.^

     It is very doubtful whether this term can be used for other than
PalaBOzoic Polyzoa. It was originally used by Munster for Cylindiical
forms, for the Glauconome marginata, Munst., in Goldfuss' Petrefac. of
Germany, is given by Hincks as a synonym of Gellaria fistnJosa, Linn. It
was, however, established by Goldfuss, and afterwards revised by Lonsdale.

M'Coy,' improving upon Phillips' * poor description does not make any
reference to the number of pores between the branchlets. In his later
work he defines the Genus more minutely thus :

     ' Corallum of a narrow central stem, with numerous pinnules, or

lateral branches uii connected with each other : both stems and branches
have two rows of cells on one face, which is usually carinated between
them, carina in some species tuberculated opposite face striated.' ^

ON THE CARBONIFEROUS rOLTZOA.  83

                        1875. Hyphasmopora, R. Btheridge, Jun.'

     The generic and specific characters of this new provisional genus are
well described by Mr. Etheridgo in the paper referred to. There is only

one species H. Bushii, and I am glad that after submitting the specimens
to Mr. Busk, Mr. Etheridge followed his own judgment and established a

new genus, rather than acting upon the indiscreet reference of Mr. Busk,
who says, ' that the above resembled the genus Vincularia, Defranc '
adding afterwards, ' it is j^robably the type of a new genus, perhaps allied

to the latter.' This beautifnl species is found in several localities of
Scotland, but I have found it in Yorkshire, and also in N. Wales. It

cannot, however, be considered a common form anywhere.

                                1850. Sulcoretepora, D'Orbigny.

     This genus has been accepted by Morris (Catal.) and by the Messrs.

Young of Glasgow, for certain species of Carb. Polyzoa. Morris gives
the above date, but the Messrs. Young in their paper - say ' The genus
Sulcoretepora was formed by D'Orbigny in 1847, with the following defi-

--nition : Cells in furrows on one side of simple depressed branches.'

      All the Carboniferous species that have been referred to this genus
have cells on both sides, and, as I have already referred one of the accepted

species to another genus, I will deal now with the Sulcoretepora Eobert-
soni, Y. and Y. As there are characters in this species altogether different
from any known species of Ptilodicta the same reference for this as

appears feasible for Fhistra ? parallela, Phill. is altogether out of the

question. The S. Sohertsoni has none of the characters in common with
Phill. sp., and I should strongly recommend the Messrs. Young to con-
struct for this typical species a new genus, especially so as ' Between

each pair of cells in a longitudinal series, 1 to 3 pores occur, normally
above each cell-aperture, and in well-preserved specimens tubercles sur-

round each cell-area more or less completely. ' ^ The faciei of the species

of Phill. and the sp. of the Messrs. Young may at first sight appear

identical, but the forms described by the later authors are destitute of the
non-poriferous, rugose, and striated margins of Flustra ? parallela. It is
upon the presence of this particularly constant character that I refer

Phillips' species to Ptilodicta.

     This genus and species, classified as it is with tlie Polyzoa is a most

peculiar one. I have not by me De Koninck's work for refei-ence, and

--the remarks that I may offer upon the species for I shall accept the

--genus without discussion are the results of original investigation. The

species is tolerably common in a few localities of Scotland. I have no

--record of it in this country except in doubtful fragments in Wales and

my type specimen was presented to me by Mr. John Young, and I believe

I may safely conclude that this, with other specimens, was seen and
approved of by De Koninck when he visited the Hunterian Museum of

Glasgow.

peculiar biserial cells appeared like an analogous structure referred to

by Prof. Nicholson when describing Carinopora HimJei, Nich.' His

figures, however, are said to be transverse ; mine are longitudinal, or in a

line with the bases of the cells. These tail-like processes are constant

mycharacters at certain intervals in  very small section, and the figures

given may help in the recognition of the genus in sections of limestone.

At first sight Archceopora has the appearance of Gallopora incrassata, as
described and figured by Nicholson, ^ but a vei-y little examination will
show the difference between the two forms, whereas one is a Polyzoa and

the other a Tabulate coral.

    I have now gone over the whole of the recorded genera and species

of British Carboniferous Polyzoa, with the exception of the Fenestellidm.

These having been so lately and so ably reviewed by Mr. Gr. W. Shrubsole,
F.G.S., their omission from this report will not be so much felt as the
omission of any of the other lesser known forms. Mr. Shrubsole,

after very elaborate investigations, and after the careful comparison of

nearly all the known so-called species, is inclined to restrict the twenty-

six species to five typical ones, namely^ :

              --Fenestella plebeia M'Coy

crassa

                                 ,, membranacea
all the other ' species ' falling into the rank of synonyms of one or other

of the five here received by him. But this does not confine the number

of known species to five. When his labours on the family are completed

several new forms will be described, together with at least two more

--species of Pohjpora the results of laborious investigations in North

Wales. There are also some references to the Polyzoa of the Carboni-
ferous Limestone of the districts between Llanymynech and Minera,

N. W., in the lately published work'' of G. H. Morton, F.G.S., Hon. Sec.

of the Liverpool Geological Society.

     Several other papers on special points, having reference to Polyzoa,
have been published during the last ten or twelve years. The vexed

question as to the Hydrozoal or Polyzoal affinities of Palceocoryne has
been debated by Prof. Duncan,^ Prof. Young, and Mr. John Young,^ and

by myself; ^ but the question as to their real affinities is still an open one.

Another paper by Mr. A. W. Waters,* entitled ' Remarks on some Fenes-

fellidce,^ contains some debatable matter, and the papers of Mr. Robert

Etheridge, Jun., on the genus GJauconome, Messrs. Young on the genus

Ceriopora, and the paper on the ' Perfect Condition of the Cell-pores and

other points of structure,' ° are valuable additions to our knowledge of

Carboniferous Polyzoa. Before any attempt can be made to construct

must be cleared up by a more complete study of all the species of the
Palfeozoic and Mesozoic ages of our earth's history. It is a difficult
matter with present classifications to place the Genera of Palfeozoic

Polyzoa without doing violence to constructed definitions. In the ab-
sence, therefore, of any well-defined families in which the Carboniferous
Polyzoa can be placed, I venture to group the whole of the forms under
separate headings, which must be considered as provisional only. But to
prevent any misconception as to the special characters of each group, I

shall refer to the shape of the cell or zooecia especially, as the basis of

my arrangement, allowing all the other characters to fall into their places

as subordinate only.

  --Primary Char. Polyzoary forming small or large fenestrated or non-

fenestrated expansions. Cells placed biserially, or alternate, so as to form

branches or 'interstices,' similar in many respects to the Genus Scrv^o-
cellaria among living Polyzoa : cells bladder-like, margin of mouth raised
and covered (?) by ' operculum ' during the life of the animal. The nearest
living representative cell among the British Polyzoa figured by Hincks ^

is that of Alcyonidium albidum, with which I can compare generally the
cells of the Fenestellidce. The foUovsdng genera are grouped provisionally,

--many details having yet to be worked out :
       Genus I. Fenestella. plebeia, polyporafa, memhranacea, in which

             --the cells are biserially placed.

           ,, II Fenestellina nodulosa, actinosfoma, in which the cells are
                            alternate, literally forming single rows.

  --Primary Char. Polyzoary forming small and large fenestrated ex-

pansions. Branches robust, cells placed contiguously in a slanting direc-
tion over the branch, opening on one side only ; the cells on the margins of
the branches (younger cells) nearly of the same shape as in the Fenes-

tellidce ; the older cells in the innermost jiortion of the branches much

compressed, but never pai'taking of a tubular character.
     Genus IV. Polypora.

The cell-structure of the following genera is such as to warrant their

separation from the whole of the above genera, but they are not suffi-

ciently studied, neither are their details so well worked out as to enable

me to suggest a projDer place for them at present.

properly placed the Silurian, as well as the Permian Polyzoa must be

carefully studied in the way that I have already suggested.

For the present, too, I will catalogue the remainder of the Carboni-

ferous Genera, reserving for the future more detailed arrangements.

myI thus, for the present, conclude  report on the British species of

--Carboniferous Polyzoa. It would have been comparatively easy for me

to have made it longer it would have been difEcult indeed to have made

it shorter. To the Palfeontologist the study of the Pateozoic Polyzoa

opens up many very important biological details, for the connection of

the Polyzoa with the Graptolites is a question that must be dealt with

in detail; and the relationship of the Pateozoic to all other Polyzoa must

be grappled with intelligently and dispassionately; and for this pur^Dose

members of the Association could help either myself or others by furnish-

ing materials for the study.

   W. ToPLEY, and ]\Ir. W. Whitaker (Secretary), for carrying on

    the ' Geological Record.'

Since the last meeting of the Association (at Sheffield) the fourth
volume of the 'Geological Record' (for 1877) has been issued. The
printing of the volume for 1878 has been begun, and some of the work
for the 3'ears 1879 and 1880 has been started.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         .

    The following jiarticulars of the published volumes may be of in-

--terest, as showing the extent of the work :

   The first, for 1874, pp. xvi. 397 (= 413) contains over 2130 entries.
  The second, for 1875, pp. xx. 443 (= 463) ,, ,, 2360
  The third, for 1876, pp. xxii. 416 (= 438) ,, ,, 2370
  The fourth, for 1877, pp. xxvi. 432 (= 458).

           The volumes therefore average 443 pages and 2280 entries.

--Lancashire. At Bootle, near Liverpool, an important boring has beeu

carried to a depth of 1304 feet by Messrs. Mather and Piatt, for the
Liverpool Corporation water-supply. The diameter is 25 inches to a
88 EEPORT-- 1880.

depth of ]000 feet, and 20 inches beneath that limit. The watei*-level
stood at 50 feet from the surface in the bore-hole before pumping com-

menced. This level is about that at which water stood in the adjacent

Bootle well, when not pumped some years ago. The character of the
Pebble Beds is well seen in the quarry in which the old well is sunk, and

in the large quarry higher up the hill, from which it is evident that the

thickness of this division of the Bunter is not less than 1200 feet, instead
of 600 to 800, as anticipated ; the base of the Pebble Beds was found in
the boring at 1039 feet, where the Lower Mottled Sandstone was first

penetrated, the rounded ' millet seed grain ' being specially charac-
teristic. This structure is well seen in the Lower Mottled Sandstone of
the Vale of Clywd. The Lower Mottled Sandstone in the Bootle boring

becomes very hard and compact at 1228 feet from the surface, being
cemented together by lime ; but the grain, when the rock is broken up, is
seen to be the same. For details of this boring and for facilities to inspect
the cores I have to thank Messrs. Mather and Piatt, of Salford Iron
Works.

Last year I stated the hai'd compact sandstone met with in the

Bootle boring at a depth of 1228 feet from the surface probably belonged
to the Lower Mottled Sandstone. I also called attention to the rounded

character of the fragments of the soft sandstones lying between the base
of the Pebble Beds, which occurred at 1039 feet, and the top of the hard
bed just described, and I further attempted to show that this rounded, or
' millet seed grain,' was present in the hard rock beneath, which is simply
the softer sandstone cemented together by lime. The boring having

failed to penetrate the hard rock, though carried to a total depth of 1304

myfeet, left a certain amount of doubt as to the correctness of                                                                                                                                             identifica-

tion.

In February, 1879, I was unacquainted with any rock resembling the

hard compact sandstone of Bootle                                                                                                                                                      in May of  the  same  year I was much
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

interested to recognise it in a series of samples of cores shown me by Mr.

Timmins of Runcorn (the contractor for the well-borings and other works

now being put down at Winwick near Warrington). On going through

the series of specimens occurring beneath the hard band, I had the satis-

faction of finding that the hard band at Winwick is underlaid as well as
overlaid by soft running-sand, with a millet seed grain, the whole series
most certainly belonging to the Lower Mottled Sandstone. Beneath them

are 49 feet of indurated mottled grey and dark marls, and calcareous

bands, overlying good limestone, which appears to precisely correspond to
the Upper Coal-measure limestones near Manchester, and the limestones

proved in the Clayton Vale Boring described in the ' Trans. Manchester

Geol. Soc' 1879 by Mr. Atherton,the cores from which I had an opportunity
of examining through the courtesy of Mr. Vivian, of the North of England
Rock-boring Company. These coal-measure deposits occurring at a

depth of only 340 feet or 113 yards from the surface, cannot but be re-

garded as a discovery of the highest commercial importance, as well as of

scientific interest; for, looking to the westei'ly attenuation of thickness of

the Coal-measures of South Lancashire, there can be little doubt but that

the Manchester coalfield will occur at a less depth beneath the limestones

than at Manchester, in which case a valuable and workable coalfield may

lie under the London and North- Westex'u Railway at Parkside, where a

boring has also recently been can-ied out, and where the coal-measures

have probably been reached at even a still smaller depth, but the par-

necessitating a visit to Crewe, where the cores are preserved.

     The following is the journal of the Winwick boring :

2^ miles distant, this is not the case ; the Pebble Beds at Hnlme Delf,

south of Winwick, dip south, or directly at the Dallam works. The

dip varies in different quarries from 4° to 8°. Taking it at 4°, and

the base of the trias at Winwick at 215 feet below O.D., and assuming the

surface of the coal-measures beneath the trias to correspond to the amount

of dip, the base of the trias could be carried down 1000 feet at Dallam

Lane Forge, or 1215 feet below O.D., and 1258 feet below the surface.

The boring of which I gave details actually penetrated of this depth

880 feet, the lowest beds met with being 70 feet of soft Lower

Mottled Sandstone, with the millet-seed grain, occurring immediately

beneath (pebble-bearing) Pebble Beds, so that these soft beds evidently

belong to the uppermost portion of the Lower Mottled series. These we

have seen at Winwick reach a thickness of more than 200 feet, and at

Bootle boring of more than 300 feet, in the latter case without their base hav-

ing been reached, so that they may possibly be 350 feet thick under War-

rington, in which case their base will be 1230 feet beneath Dallam Lane

Forge, which closely agrees with the calculation of the probable position

of the base of the trias, based upon the observed dips at Winwick. There

is therefore strong evidence to believe that the coal-measures underlie

WaiTington at a depth of 400 yards, but at what angle and in what direc-

tion they dip there is no evidence to show. The highest coals of the

Wigan coalfield, the ' Ince Mines,' are striking nearly south, between Town

Green, Ashton, and Edge Green, Golborne ; and did no lault intervene,

their southern prolongation would pass through Newton Bridge and Great

Sankey, but it is repeatedly thrown back westwards by faults, with

westerly downthrows, so that the coal-measures between Winwick and

Sutton, are entirely measures lying above the Lyons Delf of St. Helens,

and probably in great part belong to the Upper or Manchester coalfield.

In the centre of this tract a colliery has been sunk at Bold Moss, cast of

St. Helen's Junction, for opportunities to view which, and for copies of

the sections passed through, I have to thank Mr. Harbottle, the managing-

director. Several coal-seams have been passed through, and these have

been supposed to be identical with the upper seams of the St. Helen's

field                       but after having the section drawn to scale, and compared  with the
                         ;

neighbouring collieries, I am inclined to think that these coals are on a

higher horizon, and probably belong to the Upper coal-measures. Pro-

gressing westwards the first fault with an easterly downthrow is that

passing through Whiston, which, with that passing Sutton Heath, throws

in the remarkable trough of New Red Sandstone, extending from Rainhill

to Eccleston Hill, which I have lately had the opportunity of examining in

great detail ; and it will be noted that it is in this triangle that the small

tract of Upper coal-measure limestone is brought by faults to the surfixce

at Huyton, long since described by Mr. Binney and Prof. Hull. Here we

have the normal south-west and north-east strike of this area, and should

this continue eastwards, and the limestones proved at Winwick range in

this direction with a south-easterly dip, the measures underlying the tiias

of Warrington must be very considerably above the horizon of the lime-

stones, and higher in the series than any coal-measures cropping to the

surface in Lancashire. But should the limestones of Winwick belong to

the same horizon as those of the Manchester coalfield, it is in the highest

degree probable that another 600 feet, and possibly much less, would

reach the Openshmv coal, or its equivalent.

At Dallam Lane Forge boring, as stated above, distinct traces of a

fault occur at 384 feet, and at 752 feet, and Mr. Beck found the beds

in his opinion turned on end in the former. That one fault occurs

ranging up from the south side of the river is undoubted, and I was

inclined with others to attribute the brine spring met with to the action

of this fault, leading the brine from the salt district in the Keiiper

Marls to the south. But during the past year, after careful study of the

action of faults on the passage of water, I have given up this position as

untenable.

Where two porous permeable rocks are thrown against each other by a

fault, the dislocation offers little resistance to the passage of water through

the faults, and affords no facilities for its passage along its length, either

between its walls or along the face of the upcast slope.

    Where two impermeable beds of shale or clay are thrown against each

other, the fissure of the fault is narrow, so that it seldom includes foreign

material, and water can neither pass through nor along it.
     Where permeable formations are thrown against impermeable rocks,

by faults, the district is divided into watertight compartments ; water
flowing down the dip planes of the strata, ponding up on the dip side,

travels along the face of the fault, and rises until it escapes where the porous

rock crops to the surface, and is cut off by the fault, the course of which is

marked by a line of springs.                                                       h

     In the case of the fault traversing Warrington from the south, the
fissure of the fault in the salt-bearing marls would be close, and unavail-
able as a duct, and supposing even brine-laden water to have sunk into
the sandstones beneath, these being porous would not absorb it equally in
all directions, and would be incapable of conveying it, in the fissure of the
fault, to their outcrop to the north, under Warrington.

     Looking to the probable proximity of the coal-measures to the sur-

face, and that salt-springs occur in many coalfields, and, indeed in the
Wigan coalfield, near Worthington, I am inclined to believe the brine-

springs of Dallam Lane to be of coal-measure origin.

     The volume of water is stated by Mr. A. Timmins to have increased
much on reaching the solid rock at 289 feet from the surface.

    No section of the rock is visible very close to the boring, but as Upper

Mottled Sandstone is seen both to the N.E. and S.W. of it, the rock first
inet with probably belongs to this formation, and is so represented on the

map of the Geological Survey. These beds reach a thickness in the

district of above 400 feet, and as the first 289 feet consisted entirely of
drift, the upper beds here have doubtless been denuded away, and only
about 111 feet would probably be left. The boring penetrated 185 feet of
rock, consisting of red and brown sandstone, at the bottom of which was
a coar.se brown conglomerate, which is probably the conglomerate I found
occurring at the top of the Lower Keuper Sandstone, near Orrel, east of
Waterloo and north of Liverpool.

holes pass through hard red, white sandstone, with red marl partings, the
last bed bored through being soft marl, with streaks of hard, 10 feet in

thickness.

     Borings in the Trias, on the north and south banks of the Tees, col-

lected by C. E. De Ranee, F.G.S.

     The Triassic sandstones seen in the banks of the Tees, in the direction
of Stockton, dip to the S.E., and the dip obtains in the Middlesboro' salt
area, as the salt deposit was met with at a shallower level at Messrs. Bell's

boring, north of that of Messrs. Bolckow & Vaughans. Still fui-ther north

there is a local roll on the coast near Greatham, close to which there is a

boring, 1^ miles W. of Seaton Carew, 529 feet deep.

   A bore-hole was put down in 1828 by Mr. Fletcher, at Oughton,

about a mile north of Greatham, and two west of Seaton Carew. Details

     Works for the manufacture of salt formerly existed at Tod Point ; bat,

 Mr. Peacock states, whether sea water or the brine spring from the sea
was used, is doubtful. About 1856, a 6-feet shaft was sunk on the marsh
near Coatham, by the late Mr. Slate, of Redcar, in a fruitless seai'ch for
coal ; a strong brine was met with, to find which, the above boring was
put down, but the brine spring met with did not realise expectation.

     This boring is valuable as showing the actual junction of the lias and
marls with gypsum, which latter, as pointed out by Mr. Peacock, are 28
yards thick in the Middlesboro' boring. The limestones, thick salt-beds,
and gypsum in that boring, are probably referable to the Permian the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

intervening beds of red sandstone, 673 feet, are probably referable to the

Water Stones and Lower Mottled Banter, the Upper ^lottled and Pebble
Beds having thinned out.

     It would appear that a gradual overlap eastwards takes place in all
the Triassic strata, along a north-east and south-west line, the more marked
transgression being that at the base of the Keuper Water- stones, and at
the base of the Pebble Beds of the Bunter, lines of extensive erosion
occurring at the base of the Keuper building stones and conglomerates,
and on the base of the Pebble Beds of the Bunter. The great thickness
of these Triassic deposits in the north-west, is proved by these borings,
and their thinning out to the south-east is established, and has an im-
portant bearing on the depth to concealed coalfields as well as on the
water-bearing capacity of the Triassic sandstones.

Second Re/poi't of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. C.
    Williamson and Mr. W. H. Baily, appointed for the pur-
    pose of collecting and reporting on the Tertiary {Miocene)
     Flora, &c., of the Basalt of the North of Ireland. Dratvn up by

     William Hellier Baily, F.L.S., F.G.8., M.R.I.A. {Secretary).

                                           [Plates II. & III.]

Since the first report on this subject, presented to the Association at

their last meeting in 1879, the Secretary, Mr. W. H. Baily, accompanied

by assistants, has again visited the localities from which these interest-
ing plant-remains were obtained, as well as some collections from the

same places made by scientific gentlemen in the neighbourhood. He

would especially mention William Grray, Esq., M.R.I.A., of Belfast ; the
Rev. Canon Grainger, D.D., of Broughshane ; and Walter Jameson, Esq.,
Glenarm, manager of the Eglinton Chemical Works, Glasgow and Glen-

arm, who most obligingly afforded him every facility for carrying out his

investigations.

     To the last-named gentleman he is indebted for the following section
of the Miocene deposits between the Upper and Lower Basalt at Libbert,
one mile south of Glenarm, county of Antrim, who carried out the exca-
vations there for the Eglinton Chemical Company, and to whose zeal and
ability in the undertaking be is happy to be enabled to testify.

     The series of Miocene deposits at this place was found to alter con-
siderably on further excavation, the bauxite or aluminous marl being
gradually replaced by pisolitic iron ore, accompanied by a different
arrangement of the associated clays and marls.

     This band of aluminous earth termed bauxite, which was alone sought
108 BEPORx-- 1880.

 after by the Company for its value in certain mannfactures, was entirely

 lost shortly after obtaining this section, although a whiter variety was
 discovered towards the base of these deposits, on making a further exca-

  vation in another direction.

       The leaf-bed was found, as shown in the above section, at the base
 of this series of clays, marls, and conglomerates, proving by its fossil con-
 tents the entire series, including the basalt, to be of Middle Tertiary^
 Miocene Age. The deposit so designated is a light grey-coloured clay or
 marl, more or less arenaceous, and highly charged with plant-remains,
 most abundant amongst them being the branches of a Sequoia, which
 appears to be identical with the species found at Ballypalady, near An-

 trim, named by the Secretary of this report S. Du Noyeri, and which he

 considered to be intermediate between S. Lannsdorfii and 8. Coaltsice

 (Heer).i

      From the condition of these formations it would appear that they

 Avere the result of successive deposition on the shores of a lake, the iron-
 ore having probably been formed in deeper water. Under the boulder
 clay the Miocene marls were found to contain broken pieces of lignite,

 indiscriminately distributed through them, the plant-bed containing the
remains of a terrestrial vegetation, which evidently flourished at or near

the spot where they are now found, and from their complete state of

preservation aflbrdiug satisfactory evidence as to the character of that

Flora.

      Several additional specimens were procured at the extensive excava-

tions still in progress for obtaining iron-ore, found in connection with the
Miocene deposits at Ballypalady, on the Belfast and Northern Counties

Railway, near Antrim. Amongst them are many impressions of fruits
and seeds, which require closer examination, in order to their determina-
tion, than we have as yet been able to give them.

      Other specimens have also been obtained from drifted masses of iron-
ore found on the eastern shore of Longh Neagh, containing vegetable
remains, evidently of a similar age, and which, from the condition of the

deposits, are also in fine preservation. Some of these have been drawn,
and added to the series of plates preparing for publication.

    A series of the lignites found connected with these deposits and the

silicified wood of Lough Neagh has been procured, which it is intended
to examine microscopically by means of prepared sections.

      In addition to the list of plants from these beds read before the Asso-

ciation in 1879, and published in the Report, we have to add the follow-

110 REPORT--1880.

Eighth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Prestwich,

   Professor Hughes, Professor W. Boyd Dawkins, the Kev. H. W.

    Crosskey, Professor L. C. Miall, Messrs. D. Mackintosh, R. H.

   TiDDEMAN, J. E. Lee, J. Plant, W. Pengelly, Dr. Deane,
   W. MoLYNEUX, and Professor Bonney, appointed for the pur-

   pose of recording the pjosition, height above the sea, lithological

   characters, size, and origin of the Erratic Blocks of England,
   Wales, and Ireland, reporting other matter's of interest connected
   with the same, and taking oneasures for their preservation.
   Drawn up by the Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

Although the destruction of Erratic Blocks is proceeding with remark-

able rapidity throughout the country, the Committee are able to report

the discovery and preservation of many important specimens during the

past year.

   --Yorkshire. Application has been made to the solicitors of the estate

on which the Shap Granite Boulder near Filey, mentioned in the last

Report of the Committee, occurs ; and they have promised to draw the

attention of the proprietor to it, so that, it is hoped, its preservation will

be secured.

   A remarkable block of Shap Granite, found at Seamer Station, near

Scarborough, has been removed by the station-master into his garden,

where it will be permanently preserved.

This is one of the finest and most remarkaljle blocks of Shap Granite

yet observed ; and Mr. J. R. Dakyns has favoured the Committee with

the following report upon it :

At Seamer Station, near Scarborough, a splendid boulder of Shap

Granite is to be seen. This boulder measures roughly 5 ft. 8 in. x 4 ft.

10 in. X 4 ft. 3 in. It was found some years ago in quarrying a bed of gravel

near the station for ballast. The boulder, as I am informed, was fairly im-

bedded in the midst of the gravel. This gravel is one of those described by

Mr. C. F. Strangways ' as forming ' a well-marked terrace, the summit of

which is about 225 feet above the sea-level,' and as probably being the

remains of an old raised beach. The gravel can still be examined, as the

pits are still being worked alongside the railway near the station. It

consists of horizontally stratified beds of dirty gravel and sand. At the

S.W. end of the pit there is a thin wedge-shaped layer of stony clay in

the midst of the gravel.

The boulder is specially interesting in this, that it is the only boulder

of Shap Granite in the neighbourhood whose position in the beds is

known                                           and,  if the information is correct,  this position  shows that at the
                                             ;

late age assigned to the gravels, ice must have been floating about, and

--dropping far-derived boulders here and there.
     Lancashire. Mr. John Aitken, of Urmston, near Manchester, reports

that three boulders have recently been discovered in his neighbourhood,

in addition to the very large one found at Old Trafi"ord, about two years

ago, and described by Mr. Binney in the ' Trans. Manchester Lt. and Phil.

Soc' (vol. xvii. p. 55).

They have numerous groovings and striations, although none are very

deep, upon the flat sides.
     The striations of (2) are diagonal at about 45° ; and of (3) in a line

with the longest axis.

The whole of these boulders, together with two others of lesser dimen-

sions, consist of very fine highly siliceous grit rock, particularly (1) and

( 2), which almost become quartzites. They are all of a hght bluish, fawny

colour,  (1)  being of  the darkest hue                                                                                               are all compact, and do not exhibit

     These boulders, together with the large one at Old TrafFord, were

found in almost one line, viz., roughly, E. and W.
    ^0 locality of deiivation has yet been assigned to them.

120 feet above the sea.

Leicestershire. The Committee are indebted to Mr. J. Plant for the

following notices of erratic blocks in this county, in continuation of the

observations which have been recorded in previous Reports.

                                           Isolated Boulders.

  --Boulder at Aylestone, near the river Soar, two iniles from Leicester.

Dimensions 4 ft. X 3 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. It is subangular ; the direction of the
longest axis is N.E. by S.W., and it is without striations. It is com-

posed of .syenite, similar to that of Markfield, seven miles distant to

the x^.W., and there is no rock like it in the immediate locality. Long

ridges of sandy gravel running S.E. occur near it, nnd it rests on sandy

gravel.

     Another boulder composed of the same rock occurs in the same
locality. Dimensions, 3 ft. 10 in. x 2 ft. 10 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. It is also sub-
angular, with the same direction of its longer axis, and without striations.
It is 200 feet above the sea-level, and is situated at the If. end of long
ridges of hand, which appear to be the debris of Upper Keuper Sandstone.
It rests upon sand.

   --Boulderiu.the village of Thurnhy. Dimensions, 4 x 3 x Ifoot. Rounded

and without striations. It is composed of granite similar to tliat of
Mount Sorrel, eight miles distant to the N.W., and there is no I'ock like
it in the immediate locality. It is about 600 feet above the sea-level, and
rests on coarse gravel.

     Another boulder of the same character occurs in a field near the same
                                                                                                       ·

village, half a mile more distant from Mount Sorrel, and about 620 feet

--above the sea-level. Dimensions, 2 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 3 in.
     Boulder in the village of Bushby. Dimensions, 1 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 3 in.
X 1 ft. 3 in. Subangular, without striations ; composed of granite similar
to that of Mount Sorrel, eight and a half miles to the N.W. ; no rock like

it being in the same locality.

It is about 620 feet above the sea ; is connected with a long sandy

ridge, and rests upon sand.

Another boulder, precisely similar in character, occurs in the same

village. Dimensions, 2 ft. X 1 ft. 9 in. x 1 ft. 4 in.

  --Boulder in Moody Bush field, New York farm, Syston. This boulder

can be seen in the field, on the left side of ' The Ridge Way,' one mile

from its junction with the road from Barkby to Queniborough.

     Its height above ground is 4 feet ; depth in the ground probably

--between 3 and 4 feet. It is five-sided, the sides measuring as follows :

N.E. 1 foot 6 inches ;  N.W.    1 foot;  S.W. 1  foot  6  inches                                 S. 8  inches;
                                                                                              ;

S.E. 1 foot 3 inches. It tarpers gradually to the top, where its size is

reduced to about one-half.

It is sharply angular, long-shaped, and put hito the ground by

human agency. The longer axis of the pentagon at the top of the stone
points N. and S., shorter axis E. and W.

     Deeply cut into four of the sides, in rude capitals, are the words

* Moody Bush.'

     It is a very coarse ashy agglomerate from the old volcanic district on

the I^.W. side of Chamwood Forest, about 12 miles distant.

     It is about 350 feet above the sea. It is isolated, but surrounded by

--·deep drift deposits, and the bottom penetrates the Lower Lias clay.
     Note on Moody Bush Stone. This monolith, standing in a field on a

very ancient road called ' The Ridge Way,' running S.E. to Tilton-on-the-

Hill, is upon an elevation commanding a view of the surrounding country,
for many miles on all sides, and may have served as a post of observation,

or for a ' beacon fire,' or for communicating signals of other ' beacon
fires,' for which evidence exists in this country at Borough Hill, lying

due east 7 miles.
     The monolith is remarkable for having its longer axis due N. and

S. There is a tradition which says it was called ' Mowde Bush Stone,'
and a former owner of one of the large estates near Mount Sorrel held a

 Court ' at that place, called ' Mowde Bush Court,' and this landowner
and his steward used to go to ' Mowde Bush Hill,' where the stone is, and

cut a turf, which was brought into Court, The stone has been in its

present position from time immemorial.
     There is a general tradition also that it was usual for persons from

neighbouring districts to bring a turf and put on it.

  --Boulder at Johnston's Farm, Thurnby, 5 miles from Leicester. This

block is in the corner of a field called Pol's Parlour, in a valley at the bend

of the Willow Brook, W. of New Ingersby, and N. of Winkerdale Hill.
5x4x2Dimensions,
                        feet, but it extends several feet below the soil.

It is very rounded and worn, long-shaped, and the longer axis is N.W.

by S.E.

    It has probably been striated, but any striations that may have existed

have been worn into holes by weathering. It is composed of Biinter
conglomerate, or Permian breccia, and was probably derived from Barr
Beacon, or Cannock Chase, distant 40 miles due west. It is about 450

feet above the sea- level, and is at the boundary of the parishes of Ingersby
and Thurnby. It is connected with the Winkerdale Hill drift, and lies

on deep sand. ·

  --Note on the New Ingersby Boulder. This large ' erratic " undoubtedly

stands at the boundary of two parishes, but I am inclined to think it is a

mere accident ; the stone has never been moved by man, but I'emains in
the position it must have been originally left. It may at first have
been buried deeply in the drift sand, as it lies in a hollow, and has been
gradually uncovered by the washing away of this drift sand by the rain

during past ages. On comparing it with specimens of ' Bunter Con-

glomerate ' (obtained from this formation in situ), I have come to the
conclusion that it probably belongs to that formation. The nearest point
where this formation occurs is on the south side of the Ashby coalfield,
distant about 25 miles, btit from its coarse nature and the large-sized

pebbles, I am inclined to think it must have come from ' Barr Beacon ' or

' Cannock Chase.' It is in connection with gi'eat drift deposits which

really form the ridges and hills of the surrounding district, which deposits

we now know (from the cuttings of the Great Northern Railway, now in

progress) to be upwards of 30 feet thick. It is quite possible (although

its extreme hardness is against the idea) that this large block is a mass
of very coarse 'pebbly drift' (some of the 'pebbles' are sub-angular),

cemented by carbonate of lime and oxide of iron, and it may have been
brought by ice from the N.W. side of the country, where beds of con-
solidated ' pebbly drift ' of similar composition are known to exist. This
source -would be about 15 miles due N.W. The erratic is quite distinct
in composition from the sandy clays and gravels that lie ai-ound for many

miles.

       (B.) Groups of Boulders.

On the estate of Sir A. B. C. Dixie, in the vicinity of the village of

Market Bosworth, are eleven blocks, varying from rough cubes of 4 feet to
4x3x21 foot, the largest being about
                                       feet.

They are rounded, angular, and subangular.

Some of the group may have been removed from adjacent fields.

They are composed of syenites and ashy agglomerates from Bardon Hill,

Markfield, Clift Hill, and Groby, 7 to 8 miles distant. They are about

400 feet above the sea- level, and rest on the surface adjacent to drift beds.

In the village of Carlton are eight blocks of the same character, 420 feet

above the sea-level. They do not appear to have been moved, but are

scattered up and down the village.

In digging out a sewer in Victoria Road, Leicester, ten blocks were

found together, 8 feet below the surface. They were rough cubes of 2

feet to 1 foot, sub-angular and angular ; and composed of granite, syenite,

mountain limestone, and chert, from Mount Sorrel 6 miles N., Breedon

KW.Hill 15 miles N.W., Matlock 30 miles

They -were 290 feet above the sea-level.

In Rutland Street, Leicester, two boulders were found in making a
4x2x3sewer in boulder clay. Dimensions,
                                              feet and 3 ft. x 1 ft. 10 in.

X 1 ft. 3 in. They were sharply angular, composed of the granite of

Mount Sorrel, 6 miles N., 212 feet above the sea-level.

In a railway cutting near Countesthorp, Leicester, a group of boulders

was found under a deep deposit of coarse gravel. The lai'gest was 2 ft. 6 in.

x 2 ft; the smallest about half that size. They were rounded. Three

blocks were Lower Keuper sandstone ; two, oolitic limestone ; one green-
stone ; two, white quartz (altered millstone grit) . They were 400 feet
above the sea-level, and spread over an area of about 30 yards. The

group was derived from Nuneaton 14 miles W., Oakham 20 miles N.E.,
Hartshill, 15 miles W., Croft 4 miles W.

     In the village of Oadby is a group of rounded blocks of granite from
Mount Sorrel 9 miles N. The largest is 2 X 1 X 2 feet ; the smallest,
1 ft. 6 in. X 1 ft. X 1 ft. They are exposed on the surface, but may have
been moved in making the road. They are 400 feet above the sea-level.

     In Abbey Meadow, Leicester, in making the new river, a rounded
boulder of chert, about 2 feet cube, was found. It was probably derived
from Matlock, 30 miles to the N.W., and was about 120 feet above the sea-

level.

   In lowering a hill on the road near Aylestone, five blocks of syenite
were found, the largest being 3 ft. x 2 ft. 10 in. X 2 ft. 8 in. They were

sub-angular and angular and derived from Groby, 5 miles to the N.W.
                                                                                                                                     ;

They were 230 feet above the sea-level, and suri-ounded by sandy gravel.
     At Lodge Farm, on the bridle road to Ridgeway, a group of boulders

occurs ; the largest being 2 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. X 1 ft. 6 in. ; the smallest, 1 foot
cube. They are angular and subangular, and are scattered in a line for
about 200 yards. They are composed of granite from Mount Sorrel, 5 miles
off to the N.W., and are about 300 feet above the sea-level. They rest on

--the surface, but are in connection with a long ridge of drift.
     Devonshire. Mr. Pengelly favours the Committee with the subjoined
Report respecting some very remarkable transported blocks and accumu-
lations of blocks which he has observed in South Devon, the transportation
of which it does not seem possible that the action of water alone could
have effected.

   I. The Granitoid Boulders on the strand hetiveen the Start and Prawle
                                              Points, South Devon.

    On July 25, 1865, Mr. W. Vicary and I observed two granitoid

boulders on the strand between the Stai-t and Prawle Points. They were
well rounded, and totally dissimilar to any rock in situ in the district.
The larger measured 36 x 36 x 16 inches, and contained a considerable
amount of granular schorl ; the smaller one was nearly as large, of finer
grain, and not schorlaceous.

     The larger of these blocks cannot weigh less than '75 ton. Their
rounded forms may have been acquired since their lodgment on their
present sites, as they must be exposed to the action of the waves at least

every spring- tide storm. It is not improbable that the masses themselves

may have been derived from submarine granitoid rocks in situ, at no great

 distance.'

     II. The Block of Greenstone in the Village of Kingston, South Devon.

     Whilst passing through the straggling village of Kingston, nearly
three miles, as the crow flies, S.S.W. from Modbury, South Devon, on
 September 28, 1877, I observed in the highway, very near a gateway
leading to an adjacent dwelling-house, a ' greenstone ' boulder, irregularly

spindle-shaped, and measuring 4x2x2 feet, and therefore weighing up-

 wards of a ton.

                                          ' See Trans, Devon. Assoc, xi. 330-1.
   --

         ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 115

       There is a mass of greenstone figured on the map of the Geological

   Survey 2*6 miles long and "6 mile in breadth, having its longest axis in

   an E. and W. direction, and extending from due north of Aveton Gifford
   to a point about a mile W.N.W. of Kingston, where it makes its nearest

   approach to the village.

   III. The Blocks of Quartzite in the Parishes of Diptford and Morleigh,
                                                   South Devon.

       On Mai-ch 27, 1879, Mr. Paige-Browne, of Great Englebourne, near
   Totnes, wrote informing me that in a retired vale in the parish of Dipt-

   ford he had recently found a ' clatter ' of large stones, apparently quartzose,

   about two or three feet across, lying on moorish soil, and quite unlike the

   slaty rocks of the neighbourhood. They were very hard, and were broken

   up for the roads.

   On October 3 we proceeded together to the immediate neighbourhood

   of Cleve farm-house, where Mr. Paige-Browne had observed the ' clatter.'

   Measured as the crow flies, the house is about 2"5 miles S.S.E. from Dipt-

   ford village or ' church town,' and about 5 miles S.W. from Totnes.

   Adjacent to it, and on the north side, is an orchard ; and on the north of
   that, a piece of waste marshy land bounded on the west by a small name-

   less stream, which divides it from a small wood or copse, and on the east

   by a parish road. This patch of marshy land, measuring not more than

   100 feet from east to west, slopes for about 300 feet towards the north,

   where it enters a transverse valley, through which another small stream

   flows. On this waste land were the stones we had gone to see. They ex-

   tended from the orchard hedge almost, but not quite, to the transverse

   valley ; were half-buried in the soil ; and it was obvious, from the number
   of large recent-looking pits which presented themselves, that many had

   been removed within a few weeks. Nevertheless, there was still a crowd

   of blocks, all of a very fine-grained compact quartzite, of a light gTey or

   drab colour, many of them having quartz veins, and all utterly unlike the

   slaty rocks of the district. Most of them were subangular ; some almost

   perfectly angular whilst one was pretty well rounded. One, of ordinary
                                                                                               ;

   size, measured 3 x 2'5 x 2'5 feet, whilst another, perhaps the largest of the

   series, was 5 X 2'5 x 2'5 feet. The smaller of the two must have weighed

   upwards of a ton, and the larger fully two tons. There were no such

   blocks in either of the small streams already mentioned, but their beds

   were in places covered with small stones derived undoubtedly fi-om the

   same parent rock, and none of them were more than from 3 to 4 inches in

   length.

   Mr. S. Jackson, of Cleve, informed us that within the last five years

   many scores of cartloads had been taken out of the piece of waste ground

   on which we were standing, for road-repairs ; and he was of opinion that

   Wethe same practice had obtained long before his time.  had observed,

   moreover, that corresponding blocks had been largely used in building

   rough walls and fences in the district.

   Mr. Jackson also informed us that crowds of precisely similar blocks

   existed in various parts of the neighbourhood, and that a bed of rock of

   the same character was to be seen in situ in a quarry on Hannamoors, in

   the adjacent parish of Morleigh.

   Blocks proved to be very numerous in the orchard at Cleve already

   mentioned, and Mr. Jackson stated that his experience led him to suspect

                                     I2

I
       --

116 BEPORT-- 1880.

that ia all the localities there were many more than wei'e visible, as they

were frequently met with completely buried in the soil, and about a foot

below its surface. He added that he had never seen a specimen in the

wood or copse immediately on the west, or, indeed, anywhere on that

side of the small stream which divided it from the orchard and the waste-

land.

In an orchard on the New-well, or Newell, or Newill estate, about '5

mile towards the S.E., they proved to be as abundant as at Cleve, and our

guide, Mr. Jackson, stated that they were formerly quite as plentiful in an

adjoining field on the Farleigh estate, but that the ground had been com-

pletely cleared. In a copse on the Farleigh grounds, and on the edge of a

small stream, we saw a block in the form of a rectangular parallelepiped,

measuring 8'5 x 5 X 2'5 feet, thus containing upwards of 100 cubic feet,

and weighing not less than 7'5 tons.

    On Hannamoors, in the parish of Morleigh, blocks were very abundant,
and many of them of considerable size.

Prom Cleve we had been continuously ascending, but not at a high

gradient anywhere. At the highest, that is, the southernmost, point of

Hannamoors there is a quarry in which, interbedded conformably with the

ordinary soft slaty Devonian rocks of the district, there is a bed of

quartzite, identical in character with the travelled blocks we had been

studying, and of which it is no doubt the parent. This quarry is adjacent

to the high road passing westward through the villages of Halwell and

Morleigh to the town of Modbury, and occupyiiig the crest of the hill on

the northern slope of which all the blocks we had seen during the day

WeAvere lying.  crossed this road a few yards west of the turnpike gate,

about half a mile west of the village of Morleigh,' and almost immediately

entered a quarry on the southern slope of the hill, where we found another

exposure of the quartzite bed. Indeed, both quarries are worked to obtain

the quartzite for the roads. The bed dips about 30° towards (true) S.E.

nearly. So far as has been observed, the travelled blocks of quartzite

existed only on the southern slope of the hill ; they formed two parallel

trains extending northwards, from near the ridge of the hill, along the

distinct secondary valleys of Newell and Cleve ; there are none on the
minor north and south ridge, which divides the said valleys ; the Cleve,

that is, the western, train is the longer and reached the lower level ; and,
measuring as the crow flies, is about '5 mile long.

There can be no doubt that the blocks had been transported from south

to north, and from higher to lower ground. The gradient, however, is

very slight, and, as almost all the blocks are very angular as well as large,

it is difiicult to suppose that their transportation was the result of nothing

more than running water.

Should blocks be also found on the southern slope of the hill, they

would not necessitate any further modification of the foregoing conclusions

than the substitution of the words ' both northwards and southwards ' for

the words ' from south to north.'

None of the blocks we saw bore any scratches or traces of polish.

       IV. The block of ' Greenstone ' near Dipiford Court, South Devon.

     Whilst passing through the parish of Diptford, on October 3, 1879,
Mr. Paige-Browne and I observed by the roadside, near Diptford Court,

                                                 ' See Ordnance Map.
      --

       ON Tlli!: EltltATlC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 117

about 5 miles, as tlie crow flies, S.W. from Totnes, a rounded block of

'greenstone.' It measured 4'25 x 2o x 25 feet, and, hence, contained
nearly a cubic yard of stone, and must have weighed fully 175 ton. It

was without traces of polish or scratches.

    We had previously, and within the same hour, visited a qaarry in a

mass of igneous rock coloured as greenstone in the map of the Geological

Survey. This mass is represented as extending nearly east and west for

a distance of 17 mile, and having a maximum breadth of '25 mile. The

boulder, apparently of the same kind of rock, was upwards of '5 mile due
north from the nearest point of this mass. The map, however, indicates
another, but smaller, mass of greenstone about the same distance north

of the boulder.

         V. The Limestone Block in the parish of Stoke-in-Teign-Head,
                                                     South Devon.

     Having been informed by Dr. Midgley Cash, of Torquay, that he
had obsei'ved a large stone in the parish of Stoke-in-Teign-Head, and near
the road from Torquay to Teignmouth, I proceeded to inspect it. The block
is a mass of limestone, lying on the road to Upper Gable, about 60 paces
west of the Torquay and Teignmouth road, and is apparently used as a
step by persons passing over the southern hedge into the adjacent field.

    It may be described as wedge-shaped, with the angles and edges

rounded. Each triangular face measures 3 X 3 x 1*75 foot, whilst the

depth or thickness is 1"5 foot ; so that it contains about 3 '75 cubic feet,
and weighs about 700 lbs., taking the specific gravity at 2"95.'

     The extensive limestone quarries of Barton and Lummaton, in the
parish of St. Mary Church, not more, as the crow flies, than 1'25 mile

towards S.S.W., cause one to feel very sceptical as to the claims of this
mass to the dignity of an Erratic Block. Nevertheless, it appears desir-
able to recoi'd its existence.

   The WhitaJcers in the parish of Tamerton Foliot in South-western Devon.

    On June 12, 1880, I accepted the invitation of Mr. F. E. Fox, B.A.,

F.R.G.S., of Uplands, in the parish of Tamerton Foliot, in the south-
western corner of Devonshire, to inspect the ' Whitakers ' abounding on

his property. -

    The term ' Whitaker ' is a provincialism. Mr. W. H. Marshall, in his
' Rural Economy of the West of England,' 1796, says, ' Intermixed with

the soil, and often united with fragments of slate-rock, is found, in blocks
and fragments of various sizes, a species of crystal or quartz provincially

-- --whittal-er which in colour is mostly white, sometimes tinged with red

or rust colour' (i. 16).

     The term is in use about Ashburton, and according to Mr. Rock's
* Jim and Nell,' written in the dialect of North Devon, about Barnstaple
also. It occurs in ' Halliwell,' where it is defined as ' a species of quartz,'
but it is not assigned to any special localitj'.

     Uplands is from a quarter to half a mile west of the road from Ply-
mouth to Tavistock, and about 4 miles from the former town.

     The blocks in a small plantation on the crest of the hill almost adja-
cent to Mr. Fox's house were perhaps the most important group I saw

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

for though, as I was told, a large number had been taken thence for

                               ' See Ency. Brit., 8th edit. 1856, xii. 88.
--118 EEPORT 1880.

various purposes, the remainder contained so many specimens, and most
of them of such great size, that they could not fail to rivet the attention

of every geologist who saw them.

They were all partially, some of them perhaps deeply, buried in the

soil, and a few were almost completely concealed by the growth of various

plants rooted on them.

Of the blocks in this group, one measured 10 x 3 X 3* 75 feet; and

another 10'5 x 5'5 x 3 feet, the last dimension in each case being merely

the height above the surface of the soil. Making full deductions for

irregularity of form, and ignoring the undoubted penetration into the

ground, each of these two blocks must have contained fully 100 cubic

feet ; and, taking the specific gravity at 2'64, the weight of each must

have been upwards of 8 tons. These were the largest blocks known

anywhere in the district.

    From this plantation we descended into the deep narrow valley which

it overlooks on the north-west, and noted an occasional Whitaker, here

--and there, on the slope as we passed down, and a rather greater number

in and near the stream at the bottom about 200 feet by estimation below

the level of the plantation.

    On the opposite slope we again saw an occasional block, and at the

summit were taken to an artificial straight gully, 60 paces in length

--and 25 feet in width the length being in a direction transverse to that

of the valley we had left. This gully, we were assured, had been made

simply through the dislodgment of large "Whitakers, which, in a long

narrow stream, had lain huddled together, and, so to speak, had been

qnai'ried for road repairs.

All the Whitakers were of white opaque quartz, having, at least in

some cases, a laminated stnicture, and traversed occasionally with veins

and crystals of the same material; the crystals having in some instances

a suspicious look of being pseudomorphs of feldspar.

The blocks were all more or less rugged, subangular, and without any

decided traces of glacial polish or scratches. In a very few cases smooth

striated surfaces presented themselves, but wei'C probably slickensides

only.

The rock of the district is the well-known Devonian shale, or ' Shillet,'

of drab colour, having a tendency to divide into well-defined i-hom-

bohedrons                                                  and,  according  to  the  map  of  the  Geological  Survey,  this
                                                        ;

extends to great distances in all directions. It is occasionally travei-sed

by small quartz veins, but no parent rock is known which could have

supplied the "Whitakers.

At least some of the blocks, instead of lying at once on the ' Shillet,'

were lodged in a heterogeneous accumulation of clay and stones, includ-

ing Whitakers from the size of an ordinary apple to some as large as a

cocoa-nut.

That the blocks have travelled a considerable distance cannot be

doubted                                                that  their transportation    was  not  efiected by the action   of

water only, is certainly proved by their irregularity of form. From the

facts I saw it seems safe to say that they occur most plentifully on high

ground                                                 and that, unless those at low levels have rolled down   from above
                                              ;

in recent times, the surface of the district must have been essentially the

same at the era of transportation as it is at present.

Their presence must at times, no doubt, be an annoyance to the

farmer                                           nevertheless,   the  roads,    the  hedges and    other  common walls, as

ON FIXING A STANDARD OF WHITE LIGHT.  119

well as the large and numerous artificial rockeries in gentlemen's grounds
in the district, show that they are not without value, and have been very
largely utilised. Indeed, it is to be feared that, unless care be taken to
prevent it, those now remaining in the spots they have so long occupied

undisturbed, may become rapidly fewer, and disappear altogether at no

distant date.

      It must be understood that in the foregoing remarks 1 have conhned

myself to the limited district I visited. Mr. Fox told me that he had

noticed them elsewhere, and especially near Maristowe, about 3 miles off
as the crow flies, in a N.N.W. direction.

     The Committee have confined their Report to a simple record of facts,
without attempting to decide how far these facts support any special
theories. It is believed that many other erratic blocks hitherto unrecorded
are scattered over England, Wales, and Ireland ; and that every year a
large number are destroyed by agriculturists and builders. The Com-
 mittee appeal, therefore, to local observers to report upon them in order
 that evidence so valuable with respect to many problems of the glacial

 epoch may be preserved.

        Report of the Committee, consisting of Captain Abney, Professor

          W. G-. Adams, and Professor G. Carey Foster, appointed to
          carry out an Investigation for the purpose of fixing a Standard
          of White Light. Drawn up by Captain Abney {Secretaryy

        Since the last meeting of the British Association a large number of
        experiments have been made with various lights, in order to ascertain the
         constancy of the various component radiations, the total qtiantity of such
       radiation having been only partially examined. Amongst others that may
        be mentioned are coal gas and the ordinary sperm candle. The former fails
         to satisfy the necessary conditions unless the burners employed are always
        identical, and the atmospheric pressure constant. The latter is constant
        when burnt at a constant barometric pressure ; any alteration in the tem-

         perature of the surrounding air apparently not altering the relative
         intensities of the component radiations. Coal gas and candle light appear
         to be too yellow to use as a standard for white light, unless they be
         deprived of some of their lower radiations. It has been found that the
         ' crater ' of the positive pole of the magneto-electric light emits from its
         central zone a light which is excessively white, and very constant in its
         component radiations (within limits), the size of the carbon and of the

        generator being immaterial. At present, testing the light from various
         specimens of carbons is being undertaken, and not till these experiments are
         more advanced can any definite idea be given as to whether this source of

        illumination may be taken as a possible standard. The whole question is

         so involved in difficulties, instrumental and optical, that it will require a
        longer period to propose a standard for adoption than it was at first

I presumed it would do. It would be well, in the face of these difficulties,
       to enlarge the Committee, so that more workers may be brought to

         expend their energies on it.

120 REPORT-- 1880.

Report of the Anthropometric Committee, consisting of Dr. Farr,
   Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Brabrook {Secretary), Sir Gteorge Campbell,
   Mr. F. P. Fellows, Major-General A. L. F. Pitt-Kivers, Mr.

   F. G-alton, Mr. J. Park Harrison, Mr. James Heywood, Mr.
   P. Hallett, Professor Leone Levi, Dr. F. A. Mahomed, Dr.
   MuiRHEAD, Sir Eawson Kawson, Mr. Charles Egberts, and

   Professor Rolleston.

                                                                                       [Plates IV., V., and VI.]

The appointment of this Committee was renewed at the SheflSeld meeting

' for the Purpose of Continuing the Collection of Observations on the

Systematic Examination of Heights, Weights, &c., of Human Beings in

the British Empire, and the Publication of Photographs of the Typical
Races of the Empire.' Since their first appointment at the Bristol

meeting, in 1875, the Committee have had the advantage of being pre-

sided over by Dr. Farr, who has taken the deepest interest in their

labours, and has placed without reserve at their service his unrivalled skill
and long experience in the collection and arrangement of statistics. That

advantage, they regret to say, they will be deprived of in future. Dr. Farr

having intimated a desire to retire from the office of Chairman on the

ground  of ill-health                                                                  a desire  to  which  the  Committee felt compelled to
                                                                                    :

accede, while returning him their hearty thanks for his past services.
Should the Committee be reappointed, Mr. P. Galton, F.R.S., has been good

enough to consent to be nominated Chairman in the place of Dr. Farr.

    It may be recollected that the Committee reported, in the year 1878,

that their work up to that point had been rather tentative and experi-

mental, and gave details of the forms and instruments which, after much

consideration, bad been adopted by them to secure both accuracy and

uniformity.

The instruments are :

           1. A weighing machine.

          A2. simple apparatus for measuring height.
           A3. Coxeter's spirometer.

           A4 spring balance for testing strength of ai'm.

In the Report of last year they were able to state that they had

collected 12,000 original observations on weight and height, supplemented

in many cases by observations of chest-girth, colour of hair and eyes,

strength, and eyesight, and to furnish a number of tables, based on

selected portions of these returns, indicating the results to be obtained

from them. In the present year they have the satisfaction of reporting a
considerable addition to the materials at their command, the new observa-

tions of the year being nearly equal in number to all those collected in

previous years. These are shown in Tables I. and II.

The Committee submit that they are carrying on a work of no mean

value to social statistics, supplementary to that of the National Census

one that could not be performed except through voluntary association,

such as they are exerting themselves successfully to obtain.

They feel it a duty to return hearty thanks to the numerous observers,

whose names are mentioned in these tables (I. and II.), and who have ren-

dered their zealous and obliging services at great sacrifice of time. They

have also to thank the Registrar-General, and Mr, W. Clode and Mr. J. T.

Hammick, of the General Register OfiBce, for courteous and kind assistance.

                                                                                                                       121

                 I. As to Classification of Returns.

    In deciding upon the arrangement for practical purposes of returns so

various in their origin, and yet consisting in so large a proportion of infor-

mation derived from special sources, the first consideration has been to

establish a classification of the returns. In this the Committee have had

material assistance from their colleague, Mr. Roberts, who has prepared

the subjoined scheme of classification (Table III.), vv^hich the Committee

have adopted. It is based on the principle of collecting into a standard

class as large a number of cases as possible which imply the most

favourable conditions of existence in respect to fresh air, exercise, and

--wholesome and sufiicient food-- in one word, nurture and specialising

into classes which may be compared Avith this standard, those which depart

more or less from the most favourable condition. By this means, in

respect to social condition, the influence of mental and manual work ; in

respect to nurture, the influence of food, clothing, &c., on development

in  respect  to  occupation,  the  influence  of  physical  conditions                                                 and  in
                                                                                                                    ;

respect to cKmate and sanitary conditions, the influence of town and

country life may, as sufiicient materials accumulate under the hands of

observers, be determined.

     The classification has been constructed on the physiological and
hygienic laws which are familiar to the students of sanitary science, and

on a careful comparison of the measurements of different classes of the
people, and especially of school children of the age of from eleven to

twelve years. This age has been selected by Mr. Roberts as particularly
suited to the study of the media, or conditions of life, which influence

the development of the human body, as it is subject to all the wide and

more powerful agencies which surround and divide class from class, but
is yet free from the disturbing elements of puberty and the numerous

minor modifying influences, such as occupation, personal habits, &c.,

which in a measure shape the physique of the adult. Table IV.

contains some of the data on which the classification has been based.
The most obvious fact which it discloses, apart from the check which

growth receives as we descend lower and lower in the social scale, is, that

a difference of five inches exists between the average statures of the best

and the worst nurtured classes of the community. When it is remem-

bered that at birth children are of the same average size in all classes, it

is evident that the conditions of life, combined with heredity, exert a

most potent influence on the physique of the population of this country,

and it will be seen that the labours of the Committee are directed to the

elucidation of a subject which is of great national importance as well as

of scientific interest.

            II. Results of Returns relating to Glass I. (Standard No. I.)

     Tables V.-X.' and the accompanying diagi-am give the results of
the returns which the Committee have obtained relating to individuals
coming under the Standard Class (Class I.)

     ' It is necessary to call attention to the difference in the meaning of the terms

-- --average and mean which in common language are synonymous when used in this

report. An average is obtained by dividing the sum of the values observed by the
number of observations, while a mean is the value at which the largest number of
observations occur. An average includes and is influenced by exceptional cases,
while a mean excludes exceptional cases, and is consequently uninfluenced by them.

                     III. As to Oolo2if of Eyes and Hair of Glass I.

      In 1027 observations belonging to the standard or first class, the

colour of eyes and hair has been recorded. As to the importance and
utility of this branch of the inquiry the Committee may refer to Dr.

Pruner-Bey's papers, translated in the ' Journal ' of the Anthropological
Institute, vol. vi. pp. 71-92; to the 'Manual for Anthropologists,' pre-
pared by the lamented Dr. Paul Broca ; and to the ' Notes and Queries on

Anthropology,' issued by this Association. It may be useful also to

direct attention to the valuable practical remarks of Mr. D. Kaltbrunner,
in his ' Manuel du Voyageur ' (Zurich, 1879), pp. 504, 505. The types

for colour of hair are the ten lithographed pages issued by the Com-
mittee in 1877 (see Repoi't for that year). Those for colour of eyes

were directed to be : grey, light blue, blue, dark blue, light brown, brown,

--dark brown, green, black the colour to be viewed at such a distance

that minor variations may blend into one general hue and tint. In the

subjoined Table the order of the colours is altered for the reasons given

below. The extent 'to which each colour of hair prevails is shown by

the following' diagrram :

     It is to be regretted that the observations are not sufficiently numerous

to distinguish young people from adults, as the darkening of hair goes on

with advancing age. Dr. Beddoe has found a decided difference between

women of 18-23 and women over 25 years, but has observed the greatest
change to take place somewhere about 20-23 in men and earlier in
women. He states that the associations generally of hair and eye colours
shown by the table agree with his own observations ; that green eyes do

--not occur with black hair ; nor so-called black eyes with the blackest

hair this last often accompanying dark grey eyes ; and that dark blue

eyes are rare with reddish hair, but often accompany dark or even black
l^ir, usually in persons of Irish or Scottish Highland extraction. Other

interesting associations may be readily traced in Table XI.
   Mr. Roberts (by whom Table XI. was prepared) has contributed the

following remai'ks on the colours of hair and eyes :--

     * In the instructions issued by the Committee, the colours of the eyes
and hair are arranged in a crescendo scale from fair to black, but I have
thought it desirable to classify' them according to their anatomical and

ranning across the iris. In the various shades of green eyes the yellow

pigment is more uniformly diffused over the surface of the iris, and the

green colour is due to the blending of the superficial yellow pigment with

the blue and grey of the deeper structures. In the hazel and brown eyes

the uvea and the fibrous tissues are hidden by increasing deposits of yellow

and brown pigment on the anterior surface of the iris, and when this is

very dense black eyes are the result. It is very doubtful, however,

whether the iris is ever so dark-coloured in the inhabitants of this country

as to justify the term black being applied to it, and the popular use of the

expression has reference to the widely dilated pupil common in persons

with dark brown eyes. The nearest approach to a black eye among us

is the dark blue or violet eye associated with black hair in some Iiisli

adults                                here  the colour is jjrobably not  entirely due, as                                                                                                                                                  in infants, to the
                                   ;

greater transparency of the fibrous structures, but to interstitial deposit of

black pigment, or to a layer situated on the anterior surface of the iris.

    ' As the observations included in the above table were made by many

different persons without specific directions or colour-tests, and as the

shades are not well-defined and are too numerous for easy analysis, I have

--combined them into three large groups the light, including the shades

of blue ;                             the mixed,  including the grey and green                                                                                                                                                             and the  dark,  includ-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

ing the brown and so-called black eyes, in order to correct some obvious

errors of observation. Green eyes are more common than the table
indicates, and no doubt many cases of green eyes have been recorded as
grey, and probably a few as light brown. On the other hand the number

of grey eyes appears to be out of proportion to the rest, and this column

probably includes a number of light blue as well as grey and green eyes.

'Mr. H. C. Sorby, F.R.S., has examined the colouring matter of the

hair,' and has separated three pigments which he describes as brown-red,

yellow, and black ; and he attributes the different shades of the colour of

hair to one of these pigments, or to their combination in different propor-

tions. Thus, fair and brown hairs owe their colours chiefly to yellow and

black pigment ; and the shades of red hair to red and black pigments, the

brightest red having the least black or yellow. Acting on these investi-

gations, and bearing in mind that amongst black-haired races red (and

not yellow) hair frequently occurs, and is generally associated with black

hair in this country, I have interposed the black between the yellow and

red shades in the table. This arrangement has the advantage of sepai'at-

ing the browns and the reds, and of showing how the black overshadows

these colours as                            the hair darkens  by advancing  age                                                                                                                                                            and  it  is  useful  in
                                                                                                    ;

distinguishing the chief racial elements of our population. The diagram

shows the quantity of hair of each colour, and the relation which the

colours bear to each other above the age of 10 years. If the observations

commenced at birth, and were grouped in periods of four or five years, the

curve would change with advancing age, and the apex would move

gradually from the fairer to the darker shades. By grouping the whole

of the observations into fair, dark, and red, as I have done in the table, we

see the prevailing complexion of the higher and professional classes in this

country.'

     Though the statistics as yet obtained are not sufiBcient to show con-
clusively the different tendencies of town and country life, an attempt has

                                                  ' Jovr. Anthrop. Inst., vol. viii.

been made to elicit from the retai'ns of height and weight relatively to

age some particulars as to the effect of town and country origin respec-

tively on growth of this class. The means for this is given by the follow-

ing extract from the General Instructions issued by the Committee with

--the Forms of Schedule :--
     ' Okigin. If the individual has lived habitually in the country he

should be noted as ''country folk." This, however, is not to include

residence in large country towns (more than 5000 inhabitants), unless

the individual so residing is habitually occupied in country pursuits. If

both father and mother are also country folk in the sense above defined

the entry should be "pure cormtri/ folk." In cases where the history of all

four grandparents is known, and they or the majority of them were all

country folk,  the entry should have the word " very "  prefixed                                               thus,
                                                                                                            ;

"very pure country folk." If he is of country birth, but has lived in a

town since he was a boy, the entry should be " c birth, t since ioy.^' This

form admits of all required variations by writing "p c" or "v p c"
instead of "c," and " child," " youth," or " manhood" instead of "boy."

As regards other cases, too numerous to attempt to define, in which a

doubt may exist as to the proper entry, leave a blank.

' Similar instructions ro be observed as regards townsfolk.'

The returns of cadets at Sandhurst, scholars at "Westminster, students

at Aberystwith, medical students, at London Hospital, and scholars at

Felstead, afford the means of making this distinction, at ages from ten ta

thirty, in the following number of cases :

Country .      ,

                              ' Total of country origin       379

The observations give a slight advantage in both height and weight

relatively to age to country origin over town origin. Taking the two

years of age, eighteen and nineteen, in which there are the largest number

of observations in each class to afford an average, the 161 country lads

have an average height of 68'2 inches and weight of 141 lbs., while the
seventy-nine town lads have an average height of 68'0 inches and weight
of 139*5 lbs. The distinction is not so easily followed through the grades

of purity in consequence of the small number of observations in some of
them, but it seems to prevail, the averages at the two ages named being

                   Bemarks on Table XVIII.

     The number of persons observed in the above tables is too small to
admit of drawing any positive conclusions from the data ; but it is hoped
that they may be confirmed, or corrected, by other independent observa-

tions.

     1° The average growth of the girls in each year from 1 to 5 exceeds

that of the boys, but in a decreasing ratio, viz. :

    2° From 5 to 6 the scale inclines slightly in favour of the boys, viz. :

    %o ; but as from 6 to 7 it turns back agaia, being 7 in favour of

the girls, it may be assumed that the deviation was accidental, and that

from 1 to 7 years of age the growth of the girls exceeds that of the boys,

the average excess of the whole period being 5 2 %.
    3° From 7 to 9 the scale turns decidedly in favour of the boys, being

%8"1 in excess, but from 9 to 13 there is a marked excess in favour of

the girls, viz. :

     4° The great excess between 11 and 13 is the more remarkable, as after
the latter year the scale turns in favour of the boys, and continues up to
19, when the number of observations is too small to admit of any conclu-
sion being drawn from what may have been an accidental change.

From 1 to 7 the growth is slightly in favour of girls, viz.   5-2 per cent.

     With regard to the last proportion the fact is that while at the age of 12

--the annual growth among the boys begins to increase averaging about
--that which they made between 4 and 9 it decreases rapidly among the

girls. The total increase from 15 to 19 among the boys was 5'76 inches,
and among the girls only 2-50 inches.

     6° In comparing the maxima and minima growths of the two sexes,
there appear to be in the former no very marked features up to the age

of 11.

At 11 to 33 there are in this table two cases of unusual gi'owth

among the girls, viz., 6'1 and 4"9 inches in   one year  respectively                                                        and it
                                                                                                                          ;

is remarkable that in the first case the girl grew only 0'7 inch in the pre-

ceding year, and in the second case the girl (a difi'erent one) grew only

0'9 inch in the succeeding year. No such remarkable case occurred

among the boys. After eliminating these two cases, the excess in this

period remains in favour of the girls, but after 13 it preponderates greatly

among the boys :

                                                         Boj's Girls

,, 13 ,, 17           ,,      ,,    boys,      ,,  ,, 3-7 ,, 24 ,,

     7° Ti'eating the minima in the same way, those of the boys are uni-
formly lower than those of the girls up to the age of 7, viz. :

                                                                                                                                  Boj-s Girls

From 1 to 7 the excess among the girls, averaging annually 1-7 to 2-1 inches

,, 7 ,, 11        ,,      ,,      boys,    ,,      ,, 1-6 ,, 1-3 ,,

At 11 to 13 the minima of the girls are, like their maxima, exceptional;

showing that in these two years the growth of girls is not only excep-

tionally, but at both ends of the scale usually, in excess of that of boys.

                                                         Boys Girls

From 11 to 13 the excess among the girls, averaging annually 10 to 1-8 inches

» 13 ,, 19        ,,          ,,    boys,      ,,  ,,. 0-7 ,, 02 ,,

     8° The following table would be of considerable interest if it were
based on a larger number of cases. As far as it goes, it shows that in both
sexes a rapid annual growth, of 3 inches or more, occurs chiefly between
the ages of 1 to 3 and 11 to 16, the proportion being greater among girls
at the latter age, while it is greater among boys between 4 and 11.

                                      IX. Exteiisions of the Inquiry.

      It has been urged upon the Committee by Major-General A. L. Fox
 Pitt-Rivers that they ought not to neglect any of the more important
 measurements used by anthropologists, the utihty of which is well
established. ' The facts which it is the object of the Committee to deduce

 concern the influence on race ; first, of heredity, and, secondly, of external

causes. Anthropometry may be divided under the three heads : size, form,
and colour. Of these, the Committee have as yet taken cognizance only
of size and colour, except so far as the collection of photographs may be

regarded as bearing on form ; but as the study of physiognomy is not yet
reduced to a system, no statistics can be derived from these. Of the three
headings, size, form, and colour, as tests of race, colour is generalhr
allowed by anthropologists to be the most important because the most
persistent, form the next, and size the least important, because all animals
are able to increase in bulk through good living, whereas this cause has
less influence on colour and form. Of the various measurements relating

--to form, head form, especially the cephalic index, seems the most

important, for the following reasons : it is universally employed, easily
obtained, ample data for comparison already exist, it can be obtained from
living subjects as well as skulls, it is useful not only as a test of race, but
also in its bearing upon intellect.' General Pitt- Rivers therefore proposed
that the greatest length and greatest breadth of head should be added to

the subjects inquired for by the Committee. The Committee propose that
this should be done in future years.

     The Committee have had before them also a paper by Dr. Mahomed

relating to useful extensions of the inquiry to medical subjects in cases

where the observers are duly qualified medical men. Upon these sug-

gestions they propose also to act hereafter.

X. Photograplis.

The collection for publication of photographs of the typical races of

the Empire has been again enti-usted to a sub-Committee, of which
Mr. Park Harrison has been so good as to act as convener. Their report,

prepared by him, is subjoined.

' Durino- the past year about 400 photographs have been received by the

Committee, mostly from Wales, the Shetland Isles, Morayshire, North

and South Arran, Cornwall, East Norfolk, Worcestershire, and the more
Aremote parts of Kent and Sussex.
                                   certain number have been arranged

on sheets of cardboard for more ready comparison.
     ' The photographs from Shetland, taken in full face and profile for the

Committee at the expense of Mr. Brace, the owner of tJnst Island, are of

considerable value. They comprise the porti-aits of fourteen individuals

belono-ino- to families who have inhabited the islands as long as there are

any records ; and they still, in several cases, retain their original Scan-

dinavian names.

     ' The portraits from Moray and Arran, with others from difierent parts
of Scotland, were presented by Dr. Muirhead.

     ' The Welsh photographs, obtained by Mr. Harrison, represent the

darker race in the Principality, and assist in the recognition of kindred
types which appear to exist, with more or less mixture, in various dis-
tricts in England; for example, at Brandon, in Norfolk. Several portraits
ON THE INFLUENCE OF BODILY EXERCISE, ETC.                                                                                   159

from that locality have been mistaken by competent judges of physiog-

nomy for Welsh. The inhabitants contrast strongly in colour of hair and

eyes with the population of other parts of the county.'

      ' In several other counties there appear to be populations differing es-

sentially in features ; but a larger number of portraits, taken on a uniform
system, in profile and full face, would be required, together with head-
measurements, to enable the Committee to define racial characteristics.

* The Committee have been furnished with a fine series of photographs

of eleven typical inhabitants of the district around Bradford, Yorkshire,

taken and presented by Messrs. Appleton & Co., photographers, of Brad-
ford, and selected and described by Mr. Thomas Tate, F.G.S., to whom

the Committee are much indebted.

    ' Owing to the funds at the disposal of the Committee being required

for the reduction of the mass of observations that have been acquired, no
other original photographs have been taken this year under their direc-

tion. Pew consequently of those that have been obtained are of value

for strict scientific  examination                                                          and by far the greater part of  England,
                                                                                         ;

and Scotland, and the whole of Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the

Isle of Man are unrepresented at present by any photographs.' ^

The Committee would therefore press on the consideration of the

Committee of Recommendations the advisability of an extra grant for the

acquisition of photographs.

                                               XI. Conclusion.

    The Committee request that they may be reappointed, and suggest

that the reference should be in the more general terms ' for the purpose
of continuing the collection of anthropometric observations and of photo-
graphs of the typical races of the Empire.'

     They have received most efficient services in abstracting the returns
and otherwise from their assistant secretary, Mr. J. Henry Young.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Pye-Smith, Professor

   M. Foster, and Professor Burdon Sanderson (^Secretary), ap-

   pointed for the purpose of investigating the Influence of Bodily
   Exercise on the Elimination of Nitrogen (the experimients con-
   ducted by Mr. North).

During the past year four series of preliminary experiments, each of
several weeks' duration, have been made by the Committee on the subject,
the expenses of which have been met from other funds. In the course
of these experiments unexpected difficulties have been encountered
relating to method. The most serious of these difficulties having now
been for the most part overcome, we are in a position to proceed with
our inquiries next winter, and have therefore to request that the sum of

SOL, previously granted to us, may again be placed at our disposal.

    ' Out of eighty recruits who joined the West Norfolk Militia this spring, there
were only three with black or very dark hair and eyes.

     2 Since the last meeting of the sub-committee several portraits of natives of
Heligoland have been received as a gift from the divisional officer of the Coast
Guard connected with the island.
160 REPORT-- 1880.

Second Report of the Gom7)iittee, consisting of Mr. C, Spence Bate
   and Mr. J. Brooking Kowe, appointed for the purpose of explor-
   ing the Marine Zoology of South Devon.

We beg to report tliat we liave had a series of dredgings, &c., from various

parts of the coast of Devon and Cornwall, selecting more especially those

localities that have been hitherto little explored, or which previous re-

search has shown to be places of interest for the objects that have been

found.

From off the Dudman we have received many animals, which, although

not new, yet have been considered as being among the rarer of our British
Crustacea. Among them are Polybius henslowii, and a macrura that is new

to the coast, if not an undescribed species. It evidently belongs to the

genus Nephropsis. Nephropsis stewarti was taken by Mr. Wood-Mason in

the Indian Seas                           at  a  depth         of  300  fathoms                                        another  species  has  been
                                                                                                                    ;

taken during the Challenger Expedition at 700 fathoms, south of New

Guinea                                    and another at 800,  from  off Bermuda :                                     N. Atlantic.      All these
                                       ;

are remarkable for the depth at which they were taken, as well as for the

rudimentary or depauperised condition of the eye-stalks ; whereas the

British form was taken floating on the surface of the sea, and has large

and well-developed eyes.

The resemblance of all four species is very close, and the distinction

of one from the other is dependent chiefly upon the modified forms of

more or less important parts.

                                            Nephropsis cornubiensis (new species).

    We look upon the discovery with considerable interest, as it bears a near

 resemblance to the preserved fossil remains of Hoploparia belli, as figured

 by Woodward in his table of fossil Crustacea.
      If we compare our newly-found form with Nephrops norvegicus of the

 Northern Ocean, we shall find many points of similarity and many also

--of definite separation the latter so strong that were we assured that iV^e-

phropsis cornubiensis, the name by which we provisionally intend to recog-
 nise the newly-found species, were an adult or mature form, we should
 not hesitate to accept it as a distinct species. But as we know so
 little of the young of any of the macrura after they have passed the earliest
forms in which they first appear, we are induced to believe it may be no
. other than an immature condition of Nephrops. If this be the case then
 all the species of the genus Nephropsis (Wood-Mason) must be recognised
as in the same position, and probably the fossil Hoploparia also. There are
conditions that make one hesitate to affirm this too hastily, and among

these are the facts that, in the localities where Nephropsis has been taken,
 Nephrops has not been recorded. There has been no instance of Nephrops
having been taken in the English Channel, or anywhere south of the
                                            ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                         161

North-Irish and Scotch waters. And as far as we are aware, no specimen
of the genas has been taken in New Guinea, the Philippine Islands, or

Bermuda.

     This is, however, but negative evidence, and only valuable until re-
search has been perfected ; and until it is more so than at present, it will
be convenient to allow the genus Nephropsis to include the smaller

forms.

   We have also obtained specimens of Arcius arctus, and many others

of interest. But the sudden and severe illness of our colleague Mr. J.

Brooking Rowe, on whose assistance we had calculated, has precluded us

from a complete examination of all our specimens, more especially in

AAnnelids, Mollusca, &c.                                    box of offshore washings has been placed

in the hands of Dr. Zenker, of Potsdam, for examination, more especially

to ascertain the enotomostracous forms of Crustacea that may exist in

this locality.

    When all liabilities have been paid, we expect to have some eight or

nine pounds still in our possession, with which we hope to be able to

complete our report at the next meeting of the Association.

    The collections that we may secure we propose to deposit in the
museum of the Athenaeum at Plymouth, which is essentially of a local

character, and the duplicates, more especially the edriophthalmous species
of Crustacea, we intend forwarding to the Bristol Museum, to perfect

the collection of British forms in that institution.

Report of the Comviittee, consisting of Dr. M. Foster, Professor
   KollestojV, Mr. Dew-Smith, Professor Huxley, Dr. Carpenter,
   Dr. G-WYN Jeffreys, Mr. Sclater, Mr. F. M. Balfour, Sir C.
   Wyville Thomson, Professor Eay Lankester, and Mr. Percy
   Sladen (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of arranging for
   the occupation of a Table at the Zoological Station at Naples.

YoTJB Committee have to report that the Zoological Station at Naples

continues in a most satisfactory state. Under the able management of

Dr. Dohrn, no opportunity is left unemployed for promoting its efficiency

and   utility                               and  in  these  endeavours   he  is  admirably seconded  by  his
                                         ;

whole staff. During the past year the establishment has been placed

upon a more secure footing than it has previously enjoyed, by the German

Government having voted a grant equivalent to 15001. towards the sup-

port of the Station, and which is understood to be an annual and per-

manent one. As a proof of the great interest taken in the undertaking

in Germany, it may be mentioned that this grant was the result of a

direct resolution of Parliament on a petition moved by Helmholtz,

Dubois- Raymond, and Virchow ; and that in the discussion that followed

many of the chief men of the Reichstag took part. The money is

bestowed as a donation from the Empire, for which no return is asked,

each  separate                              State paying    for  the  hire   of its  table  in  the  usual way
                                                                                                                                                      ;

Prussia having three tables, and five other States one each. In addition

to this Prussia votes 1501. annually towards the publications of the Sta-

tion ; and the Berlin Academy has this year gi-anted 100?. for the first

1880.                                                                 M

volume of the 'Fauna und Flora.' It will thus be seen that Germany-
contributes a total sum of between 2250Z. and 2350?. per annum towards
the expenses of the undertaking : a truly noble support, when it is borne
in mind that the nation has no greater dii'ect participation in the

advantages of the Station than any other country or association that may

hire a table.
      In addition to the tables previously taken, one has recently been hired

by Belgium and one by the Italian Navy ; the last chiefly for the purpose

of instructing officers in the collection and preservation of marine
organisms. Russia has also prolonged its contract for five years.

      The Royal Society has granted 100?. towards the publications.

      Respecting the publications issued under the auspices of the Station,

the following monographs of the series ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von
Neapel ' will be issued in the course of a few weeks :

     1. Dr. Chun : ' Ctenophora.'
     2. Dr. Emery : ' On Fieresfer.'
      The remaining monographs mentioned in the previous Report are all
in a forward state ; and to the list already given there has recently been
added one by Dr. Andres on the Actinite of the Gulf.
      Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station ' (in which are
 published, amongst other works, the investigations carried out by the
members of the staff of the Station which are not comprised in special
 monographs) vol. i. and vol. ii. part i. have already appeared, and part ii.
is now in the press.
     The ' Prodromus Faunae Mediterranese ' is near completion, and may

 probably appear during the year.

      The ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' for 1879 is in the press.
      The Library of the Station is continually on the increase, and the num-
 ber of journals has been considerably augmented by the exchange of the
 ' Mittheilungen ' for the proceedings published by other institutions.
      The collecting capabilities of the Station have gained an important
 advantage in the Scaphander diving-apparatus. Officials belonging to
 the establishment have already descended to a depth of 20 metres, and
 remained over an hour on the sea-floor, searching for animals and plants ;
 and by this method many new insights have been obtained.

     A new tow-net has also been constructed, according to a device of Dr.

 Dohru's, by which the animals occurring in different dej^ths may be

 caught ; the apparatus being so arranged that the net can be opened or

 closed at any depth it may be desired to investigate.

       Surface-collecting is carried out daily as usual ; and dredging from
 the steamer is prosecuted sevei'al times per week ; excursions for this
 purpose having latterly been extended as far as Gaeta and the Ponza

  Islands.

      In order to keep pace with the advances made in methods of in-

  vestigation, various additions of apparatus and instruments have been

 acquired by the laboratory : under this category may be mentioned four
 new microtomes, a micro-polai'iscope, a spectroscoj^e, and an induction

 apparatus, besides other apparatus which it is unnecessary to mention

  here.

      Two elevated reservoirs have recently been erected, by which a regular

 circulation of sea-water can be supplied to a number of smaller basins,

      By means of the reconstructions carried out during the previous year
                                                                                   ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                                                             163

the aquarium has gained both in beauty and utility, whilst the new system

upon which the glass plates have been fixed has proved so satisfactory

that not a single leakage has taken place. Observations upon the organ-

misms situ are much facilitated, being now taken regularly, and tabu-

lated by one of the officials of the Station.

In the Dredging Department the Station has received from Dr. Wm.

Siemens about 1000 metres of iron wire of special manufactiire, where-

with dredging can be carried on in much greater depths than formerly.

Your Committee have pleasure in announcing that since the presenta-

tion of their last Report, Dr. Dohrn has himself set on foot a scheme for

the foundation of a travelling fund for the benefit of naturalists who may

occupy the English tables, and that a sum of money has been contributed
which may be applied to this purpose. Your Committee are therefore
now in a position to oSer a grant of money towards the travelling ex-
penses of any naturalist who may be selected to occupy the Association

table.

It should also be mentioned that preparations are progressing for the

establishment of a small Zoological Station at Messina, as a dependency

of the one at Naples. Students who come to work at the latter place

will thus be enabled to find similar advantages at Messina, although on a

smaller scale                                                                      whilst the fauna is even richer in pelagic animals than that
                                                                                ;

of Naples.

For these additional advantages, several lessors of tables (Prussia,

Baden, Strasburg, and others) have already consented to raise their con-

tributions from 751. to 901. Your Committee would strongly advocate the

adoption of a similar course by the Council of the British Association
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

not only on this account, but also in recognition of the special advantages

afforded to occupiers of the English tables by the establishment of the

travelling fund above mentioned.

Your Committee would, with these particulars before them, most

strongly urge the renewal of the grant as a worthy contribution towards

the advancement of science.

Since the last Report the Association table has been occupied by Mr.
        Wm.
Arthur                                                                             Waters,  whose  report  will  be  found  appended                                                and also

various details, kindly furnished by the staff of the Zoological Station.

   I. Report on the Occupation of the Table, hy Mr. ArtMir Wm. Waters.

    The British Association granted me the use of their table at the

Naples Zoological Station for two months, from the beginning of November
last year; but, being in an unsatisfactory state of health, I soon found that
I was unable to stand the climate of Naples, and was forced to leave by

the middle of that month, and, consequently, have no report to furnish of
work cornpleted, but will indicate some of the points I hoped to be able

to investigate.

     Recently a good deal of attention has been paid to a tissue of the

Bryozoa, now called the endosarc, which at one time was looked upon as

a colonial nervous system ; but, thanks to the researches of Joliet and
others, we are able to see that the earlier views were quite incorrect, and

know that it plays a most important part in the economy of the colony,

a,lthough not as a nervous system, but in connection with the growth and
life of the various parts of the Bryozoon. The endosarc in one zooecium

                                                M2
164 KEPOBT-- 1880.

is connected with that in another by means of disks in the zooecial walls,'

which have been called rosette-plates.

    These rosette- plates I found, as regards position, form, &c., furnish

characters which in some genera are of great use in the specific determi-

nation, and from what I have seen anticipate that in some cases they also

can be used to distinguish genera. By the position of the rosette-plates

in recent and fossil species (when the state of fossilization allows exami-

nation), the part of the zooarium from which fresh growth takes place is

in  most  cases                                             clearly indicated                                                                          and it  seemed  to me  of  great  importance
                                                                                                                                                    ;

that a comparative study of the endosarc and its position, and of the

rosette-plates, should be made ; and the arrangements of the Zoological

Station furnish every opportunity for so doing, and made it the more

disappointing to relinquish the investigation.

    ZooiotryoH pellucidus, the ctenostomatous species examined by Rei-

chert, being transparent, is very favourable for examination, and from

watching it in different circumstances I conclude that in the normal con-

dition the endosarc always consists of a large number of fine threads,
and when it is found as a more solid cord it is in a less vigorous state,

absorption of some of the tissues has commenced, and, if I am justified

in drawing conclusions from incompleted work, this condition must be

looked upon as pathological, or, perhaps, it must be considered the result

of a check to growth caused by periodical or exceptional causes, such as

the unsatisfactory nature of life in an aquarium. This was shown in

several cases in specimens which, when freshly collected, showed a vast
number of anastomosing threads, but after living some days in the

aquarium presented the thick cord in much the condition figured by

Reichert.

    After some considerable trouble I induced DiacJwris magellanica, a

transparent cheilostomatous species, to root upon some slips of glass,

placed in my small tank for the purpose ; but being successful in this only

just before leaving, I was unable to make the continuous observations

intended. It, however, seemed that while this species, which is brought

from a depth of 30 to 40 fathoms, would live in the aquarium, showing

for some time activity of the avicularia, and occasionally movement

of the polypide, and also throwing out radicles, there was, with this

exception, no further growth ; so that a bud, which was growing when

brought in, would remain at the same stage, and the contents of the cell,

which were of a cellular character, would separate into an irregular

network.

    From these and other observations, I saw reason to believe that besides

the study of actively growing specimens, much could be learnt from an

examination of the reversed changes, which take place when growth is

arrested                                               and  apparen.tly  ari'est                                                                       of growth       takes  place  in  some  parts
                                                    ;

frequently and perhaps in the whole periodically, when the endosarc will

become consolidated, and is thus a store ready for fresh growth.

    From the immediate neighbourhood, I found but few species not

mentioned in the paper published two years ago, but hope shortly to

draw up a list of additions from a somewhat wider range some are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

species known in distant localities, thus again showing that the geo-

graphical range is often very large with the Bryozoa.

    ' The rosette-plates may be seen also in the diaphragms of some Ctenostomata

in the avicularian chambers, and in Jldmbranijwra ccn-icornis is well developed at
the base of the projecting process.

     Of material, whicli I had more or less prepared for examination, I
sent home a series in tubes and bottles at that time, hoping I should in

the future have the health to complete the investigation, but if unable to
do so, these points will no doubt all be elucidated ere long by others.

     I found the zoological station much changed in several particulars
since I was previously there. The staff is now much larger, with the
duties more subdivided ; and the library, which is now removed into a
more convenient room, is much improved ; but for some time the weak

point is likely to be in systematic works. I cannot close without saying

that I always found the staff ready to give me every assistance, and

must thank Dr. Dohrn and Dr. Eisig for their kindness, especially in

giving me leave to apply to the Station for help in any work I undertook

while remaining in the neighbourhood.

II. Beport on the Reference Collection.

     The General Reference Collection has latterly received considerable
attention under the management of Dr. Paul Mayer (in conjunction with
Mr. Schmidtlein for Fauna and Distribution, and Dr. Berthold for Botany).
Dr. Mayer has kindly furnished the following notes.

     1. The object of collection is :
          a. To facilitate the determination of specimens for students work-
                    ing in the laboratory, and to serve as a reference in doubtful

           cases.

b. To collect material for the Fauna of the Gulf of Naples (extend-
        ing northward to Gaeta and southward to Salerno), and

         specially for comparison with the forms from Messina.

c. To collect material for systematic purposes, such as the in-
         vestigation of individual variation, mimicry, and biological

          questions in general.

d. To obtain material for anatomical and special histological in-
        vestigations, special reference being had to the best methods

of preservation.

%2. Preservation is generally effected in alcohol of 70 to 90 ; for
%fishes, alcohol of 50
                        is mostly used ; and plants are usually

placed first in concentrated solution of common salt, and then

           in alcohol.

3. The number of specimens representing the diS'erent groups of
        animals varies greatly, because (a) some of the forms are not
         equally abundant in all localities (b) the preservation is not

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

        yet sufficiently good in many groups for the animals to remain
       thoroughly recognizable (c) in many groups the determination

                                                                                                                                                               ;

         cannot at present be carried out.

4. The determination of the specimens is undertaken, as far as prac-

         ticable, by specialists.
5. The following summary will indicate the present condition of the

   different groups :

--a. Fishes. Most of the forms of the Gulf represented, together

        with some interesting young stages.

--b. Tiinicata. Well represented, specially Ascidiee ; and nearly all

          determined.

         determined by P. Mayer. Important collection of Zcese

          reared from the egg.
            Amphipoda, Isopoda, Copepoda, &c., only poorly represented,

          on account of the difficulty of determination.

170 EEPORT-- 1880.

     To enumerate, classify, and correct these contributions ; to add some
remarks, supply a few omissions, and correct one or two errors since
discovered in tlie work refei'red to above, is tlie object of this paper.

     I commence by re-defining the suborders into which I have divided
the Chiroptera, adding some important characters previously omitted.

                      Suborder I.--MBGACHIROPTERA.

     Crowns of the molar teeth smooth, marked with a longitudinal furrow
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

bony palate continued behind the last molar, narrowing gradually back-

wards ; trapezium large, deeply grooved for articulation with the trochlear

base  of  the  first  metacar^ial  bone                          second  finger  with three  phalanges,
                                                              ;

generally terminating in a claw ; sides of the ear-conch united below,

forming a complete ring at the base pyloric extremity of the stomach
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

elongated ; spigelian lobe of the liver ill- defined or absent.

                   Suborder II.--MICROCHIROPTBRA.

     Crowns of the molar teeth acutely tubercular, marked with transverse
furrows ; ' bony palate narrowing abruptly, not continued laterally behind

the last molar ; trapezium small, forming a simple articulation with the
concave base of the first metacarpal bone ; second finger with a single
rudimentary phalanx, rarely (in Blmiopoma only) with two, not termi-
nating in a claw ; stomach simple or with the cardiac extremity more or
less elongated ; spigelian lobe of the liver well developed.

                    Suborder I.--MBGACHIROPTERA.

                    --Family PTEROPODiDiE.

                                Epomophorus monstrosus, Allen.

    In the Paris Museum I found a specimen of this species from Ogone,
collected by M. Marche, which had previously been unknown south of the

equator.

                                               Epomcyphorus minor.

                              Ejwmojilwrug minor, Dobson, 'P.Z.S.' 1879, \i. 715.

     This small species should come next after E. macrocephalus, which

stands second in the list of species in the ' Catal. Chiropt. Br. Mus.' It is
scarcely more than half the size of that species, but resembles it in the form

and arrangement of the palate ridges. The head is, however, proportionally
much shorter and broader, and in comparative measurements the female
differs less from the male, as I have shown in the original description.
These remarks are founded on an examination of five well-preserved adult
specimens which I owe to the kindness of Dr. Robb, H.M. Indian Army,
Civil Surgeon of Zanzibar, and the following are the raeasurements of
the largest, a perfectly adult male :

     Length: head and body 4" '0 inches, head 1"'65 (in adult female 1"'55)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

eye from tip of nostril 0"'65 (in adult female 0"'55), ear 0"'72, forearm

     ' In the Stcnodermata, which are frugivorous or sanguinivorous in their habits,
this character is not well developed, but the fundamental form of the teeth is the
same as in other ^licrookirojrtera.

    ^ All species referred to in this paper, and of which descriptions may be found
in my work on the Chiroptera, are simply named other species since described have

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

      Hab. Zanzibar.

                               Epomopliorus labiatus, Temm.

      The occurrence of well-preserved spirit specimens, in the collection

received by me from Dr. Robb, enables me to define the species more

correctly than I was able to do in 1878, when dried skins were alone
available. While agreeing closely with E. gambianus in the total length
of the head, the muzzle is shorter, and all other measurements, except those
of the feet, are less. The fifth palate ridge also is not divided, being
marked by a slight gi'oove only. The following are the measurements of

an adult female with well-worn teeth :
      Length : head and body 5""0 inches, head 1"'95, eye from tip of

nostril 0"-8, ear 0"-8, forearm 2"-85, thumb l"-2, third finger l"-95,
 (1st ph. l"-3, 2nd ph. 2"0) fifth finger (metacarp. l"-9, 1st ph. 0"-9,
2nd ph. 0"-95), tibia 1"-15, foot 0"-75.

     The fur extends much less densely upon the interferaoral membrane

and legs than in E. gamhianus a very few hairs only appear upon the
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

backs of the feet. In the female there are distinct, though rudimentary,
shoulder-pouches. Hah. Abyssinia ; Shoa ; Malindi (Fischer and Peters).

                                      Epomophoriis comptus, Allen.

    When describing this species the only specimen available was the skin

of an adult female preserved in alcohol. Hence I was unable to add very
many desirable particulars, especially those relating to secondary sexual
characters and dentition. Fortunately this deficiency has been lately amply
made good by a most excellent account of the characters furnished by an
examination of four specimens preserved in alcohol, and a skin, by Dr. J.

A. Smith, published in the ' Proc. Roy. Pliys. Soc. Edinb.' 1880, pp. ,362-

69, the paper being accompanied by two woodcuts. The spirit specimens,
consisting of two adult males and a female with a young male (which she
was nursing when captured), I have since had an opportunity of examining
in the British Museum (to the collection of which they have been pre-
sented by Dr. Smith), and I can endorse the very great accuracy of Dr.

Smith's remai'ks.

    The following measurements were made by me before seeing Dr.

Smith's paper :
172 REPORT-- 1880.

     In the fourth column I have arranged the measurements of the skin

of the adult female specimen from which my original description was

taken. The differences in the comparative measurements of the soft parts

(notably of the ear and muzzle) between this and the female spirit speci-

men in the third column, are easily explained by the distortion alwaj's

occurring even in the best preserved skins, and shows how very advisable

it is never, if possible, to describe from skins. It may be noticed that the

thumb and third finger of one of the male specimens is considerably

shorter than those of the other, though the rest of the measurements agree

remarkably closely.

    In my description of this species I took care to remark that, in the

adult animal, there wei-e two upper incisors, for I had noticed how, in

E. franqueti, the lateral upper incisors were liable to fall out (vide ' Catal.

Chiropt.' p. 13), and these well-preserved specimens show that my suspi-

cion that the dental formula did not really differ from that of the other

species was quite correct. As Dr. Smith remarks, the immature male has

four upper incisiors, quite similar to those in immature examples of

E. franqueti, one of the males has lost both upper outer incisors, the other

and the female has lost the left upper incisor only.

The presence of two upper incisors _ only, which was fixed upon as a

distinguishing character by the author of the original description is,

Wetherefore, conclusively shown to be a delusive one.  have, however,

in the form of the palate ridges, as previously noted by me {op. cit. p. 14,

pi. II. fig. 5), a valuable specific character which can be relied upon,
especially when taken into consideration with other characters. The

figure of the palate ridges referred to above, taken from the single indif-

ferently preserved female specimen, is sufficiently accurate, but, necessarily,

not so good as the excellent woodcut of the same parts in an adult male

individual, which illustrates Dr. Smith's paper. In this species, then, the

third palate ridge (that between the second upper premolars) is undivided

like the preceding ridge, while in E. franqueti (with which alone it may

be confounded) the corresponding ridge is represented only by a promi-

nent oval papilla at either side.

   EAs in . franqiieti, the males of this species have large shoulder-pouches

measuring nearly half an inch across in specimens in alcohol, probably

much larger in living individuals. In these specimens a minute tail about

one-tenth of an inch long is concealed among the hairs. I was unable to

find any trace of one in the skin of the female specimen referred to, and

there is certainly none in any specimen of E. franqueti I have yet exa-

mined. This part of the body being evidently in a vanishing condition, its

suppression should not lead us, in the absence of other distinguishing

characters, to found therefrom even a distinct race, much less a species.

Hah. West Africa (Lagos, Gaboon, Old Calabar, Ogone).

                                                 Pteropus germaini.

                             Pteropus germaini, Dobson, 'P.Z.S.' 1878, p. 875.'

     Ears shorter than the muzzle, concealed by the long fur of the head,
triangular, obtusely pointed, thinly clothed throughout with soft hairs.

    ' Scarcely was my work on the Chiroptera'out of the hands of the printer when

I was enabled, through the kindness of M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards, to inspect some
most interesting specimens of bats lately received by the Paris Museum, among
which were the type of this species, and others to be referred to hereafter.

Fur long and woolly, like that of Ft. aneiteanus, on the back long like
that of the head, directed backwards. Humerus and forearm rather thinly
covered with straight fur like that of the back. The legs are clothed with
long fur, which extends to the backs of the feet; the margin of the wing-

membrane almost as far outwards as the extremity of the fifth finger is

clothed with straight appressed hairs ; the posterior margin of the nar-

row interfemoral membrane is quite concealed. Face in front of and

immediately above the  eyes light  greyish-brown                                                                    head  and  the whole

inferior surface of the body dark blackish-brown, interspersed with several

shining greyish hairs, the shoulders and back darker, the rump and legs

greyer ; upper surface of the neck and shoulders pale yellow with reddish

extremities.

Teeth like those of Pt. medius, the first upper premolar small, scarcely

raised above the level of the gum, and occupying the centre of the small
space between the canine and second premolar ; last upper molar slightly
larger than the first lower premolar, and about the size of the last lower

molar.

     Length (of a not quite adult female) : head and body about 6" inches
head 2"-3, ear 0"8, forearm 4"'7, thumb 2"-3, third finger (metacarp.

2nd ph. l"-35), tibia 2"-2, foot 1"7.

    Hah. New Caledonia. Type in the collection of the Paris Museum.

     This species resembles externally, to some extent, Pt. aneiteanus, but

the very different form of the teeth at once distinguishes it. From Pt.

vetulus, inhabiting the same islands, it is distinguished by the completely

different colour of the fur, as well as by the absence of transverse basal

ridges in the molars and premolars. Its food appears to consist, in part
at least, of figs, as I found portions of these fruits in the mouth of the

typical specimen.

                   Pteropus hypomelanus, Temm.

To the localities for this species add Cambodja.

                           &Pteropus Icerandrenii, Q. G.

     To the islands inhabited by this widely distributed species must be

added New Caledonia, where are found two other species also, namely,

Pt. vetulus and Pt. germaini.

                             Cynonycteris amplexicatidata, Geoff.

Add also Cambodja (M. Harmand, Paris Museum).

                                          Cynonycteris collaris, lUiger.

     Lord Lilford has brought from Cyprus, and presented to the collection
of the British Museum, specimens of the large frugivorous bat of that

island, which I find undoubtedly belongs to this species, hitherto known

only from Equatorial and Southern Africa. I have already pointed out
the close connection which exists between this species, C. cegyptiaca, and
C. ainplexicaudata, and this fact of specimens agreeing in all respects with

South Africa.n examples occurring in Cyprus, where we should rather

expect to find 0. cegyptiaca, renders it extremely doubtful whether the
characters used to separate the species are really of specific importance.
More specimens are, however, required before this question can be finally

settled.

                                         Bhinolophus minor, Horsfield.

       Dr. W. Peters remarks ' that I have unaccountably confounded Bh.

   cornnhis, Temm. with this species, which, he states, is to be distinguished

   from it, as Horsfield's figure shows, by the superior margin of the central
   connecting process behind the sella being obtusely rounded ofi", as in
   Bh. affinis, and not sharply pointed.

       The following notes will, I think, sufficiently explain why I still regard
   Bh. cornutus, Temm. a synonym of EJi. minor.

        1. With respect to Horsfield's figures they are not only badly executed,

   but were taken, as the types show, from very badly preserved specimens,
   and therefore cannot be depended upon as correct.

        2. The type of Bh. minor (lately in the collection of the India Museum,
   and now transferred to the British Museum) agrees so closely vrith

   Horsfield's description that there can be no doubt of its being really the
   type of the species. In it the part of the noseleaf referred to above is
   very different in shape from the corresponding part in Bh. affinis (to
   which Dr. Peters likens it), it is triangular and pointed, very like that of
   Bh. landeri (see ' Catal. Chiropt. Br. Mus.' pi. vii. fig. 9), and quite
   similar to that of two specimens from Japan, lately added to the collec-
   tion of the British Museum, which I have no hesitation in recognising as

   examples of Bh. cornutus, Temm. But in other specimens of Bh. minor,

   especially in those of smaller size, I have observed that the superior margin
   of the posterior connecting process is even more acute, in some exceedingly
   so, constituting the variety Bh. pnsillus, Peters, (not Temminck) in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

   others, still smaller, the terminal portion of the posterior lancet-shaped
   nose-leaf is broad, with straight sides, forming almost an equilateral

   triangle, very different from the corresponding narrow terminal process
   in other individuals, constituting another variety, which, until lately, I
   considered a distinct species and named Bh. garoensis. As a further indi-

   cation of how liable this species is to vary, as I have previously remarked,

   the position and size of the second lower premolar is very uncertain, being
   found in some small individuals of moderate size and standing in the
   tooth-row, in larger specimens minute and quite external, and vice versa.

     The Alps and the Pyrenees have been hitherto considered the northern
limit of the distribution of this species in Europe, but lately M. Lataste

has discovered it at Saint Paterne, a place north of the Loire.' Dr. B. L.
Trouessart remarks * that as M. Lataste had previously obtained specimens

of the same species at Vernet-les-Bains (Pyrenees Orientales) it may be

fairly supposed that it is distributed in greater or less abundance through-

out N.W. and S.W. France.

                                                                                    Bhinolophus lii-pfosideros, Bechst.

The types of Bh. pusillus, Temm., in the collection of the Leyden

Museum, are, as I have previously remarked, undoubtedly specimens of

Eh. hipposideros, and I have, therefore, considered Temminck's species

identical with that previously described, especially as his description quite

agrees with the characters afforded by the types. Prof. Peters, however

considers ^ that I should not have been led to beUeve that the so-called

types are really the types, and suggests that an interchange of labels may

have taken place, remarking that I should have attended more closely

to the figure of Eh. pusillus which accompanies Temminck's description.

To this my reply must be much the same as in the case of Eh. minor et

cornutus (vide supra) namely, (1) that Temminck's figures cannot be

depended upon                                                                       (2) that even \iEh. pusillus, Temminck, be as defined by
                                                                                 ;

Dr. Peters, I can only (for the reasons stated above under Eh. minor)

consider it a variety of Eh. minor ; and (3) that in taking the types as

a guide I acted only as Dr. Peters did years ago, in the case of Spix's

Brazilian types, and for which he deserves the thanks of every naturalist.

To the synonymy of this species, as given by me, should be added

Vespertilio mimihis, Montagu, ' Trans. Linn. Soc' 1808, p. 163.

                                                                                    Ehinolophus ferrum-equinum, Schreb.

     All the known Ethiopian species of the genus are more or less related

to this species, agreeing with it in the low antitragus which is separated

from the rest of the outer margin of the ear-conch by a shallow obtuse-

angled notch, also in the geaeral form of the nose-leaf, in the very small

size of the second lower premolar (which is quite external to the tooth-
row, the first and third premolar being closely approximated), and more
or less in the closeness of the second upper premolar to the canine. It is

worthy of notice that no species having all these characters in common

has as yet been found beyond the limits of the Ethiopian and Paleearctic
regions.'* Of these allied Ethiopian forms I have recognised four as
species, namely Eh. landeri, clivosus, capensis, and cethiops, but between
these and Bh. ferrum-equinum come several more or less intermediate forms
presenting slight differences either in the nose.leaf, in the position and
size of the first upper premolar, in measurements, or in the colour of the
fur, which I have included in the synonymy of Bh. ferrum-equinum and Eh.

    ' I have to thank M. Lataste for sending me specimens of this species (and

of others to be referred to farther on), of which he obtained 200 individuals at the
above-named place.

able in our jMiiseums, to say how far some of them may be regarded as

representing permanent varieties. Of these some were not included in my

work, either owing to accident, or because I had not been able to obtain

in time before publication an examination of the types or copies of the

papers in which the}' were described. These I now proceed to notice.

with dark-coloured fur.

To my description of this most remarkable species the following may

be added :

The calcaneum is weak, but distinct, nearly one-fifth of an inch in

length, and projects at its extremity slightly beyond the interfemoral

membrane                                                   there  is  no  trace  of a  tail  externally ;                           the wing-membrane
                                                        ;

extends to the proximal extremity of the metatarsus ; the female has

pubic teat-like appendages, as in the other species of Bhinolophidce ; the
terminal phalanx of the fourth finger ends in a large T-.shaped process.

The measurements agree closely with those of the specimen in the Leyden

Museum from which my description (' Catal. Chiropt. Br. Mus.' p. 153)

was taken.

To the localities of this species add Laos (in the roof of the Great

Pagoda at Lakhon, collected by M. Harmand) and Bantam, Java. In

the Laos specimens the fur is very dark brown above, (appearing black

in alcohol), beneath jialer, the terminal third of the hairs ashy; ears light

brown                                 membranes very dark brown or black.

    Although many times larger, yet in general external structure this

species agrees very closely with M. spasma, the relative proportions of
parts, however, being somewhat diSerent. Thus the posterior lobe of
the tragus, though similarly shaped, is proportionately shorter, while the

anterior lobe is much broader at the base, more convex forwards, and

obtuse at the tip ; the nose-leaf also, though almost identical in shape,

is not much larger than that of that species.

     While in M. spasma the extremity of the second finger does not extend
as far as the middle of the first phalanx of the third finger, in this species,
as in M. frons, it extends beyond it.

     Tail rudimentary, two short vertebrae only project beyond the extre-

mities of the ischiatic bones, and are quite concealed between the two

layers of integument, divided from the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the

body, forming the base of the large interfemoral membrane.

The single specimen, an adult male, is very peculiarly coloured, some-

what like the specimen of M. hjra, in the writer's collection previously

described.' As in it, the general colour of the fur, ears, nose-leaf, and

membranes is white, the base of the fur, upon the upper surface only,

being pale slate-blue, the colour so characteristic of the genus unlike the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

other known species, the extremity of the carpus, the thumb, and the

membrane between the thumb and the second finger are clothed with

short hairs, in the type specimen of a white colour.

The teeth scarcely difler in general form from those of M. spasma, but,

as in the Ethiopian species of this genus, there is no minute upper pre-

molar, and the dental formula therefore agrees with that of M. frons.

The rudimentary premaxillne resemble more closely those of the Bhino-

lophidce than those of any other species of Megaderma. As in that family,

they project considerably beyond the line of the canines, from which they

are also separated by a diastema on either side, and two small depressions

in the gum may be seen, which appear to be the empty sockets of a pair

of rudimentary teeth, occupying precisely the same relative position as in

the species of Bhinolophidce, an additional indication of the close affinity of

the Nyderidce to that family.

In the skull, as I have generally observed in the larger species of each

genus, the sagittal crest is well developed, and the pair of ridges into

which it divides in front are so strongly marked as to cause the frontal

bones between them to appear considerably hollowed. These ridges ter-

minate on each side in a blunt but well-marked post-orbital process, which,

however, as in M. spasma, is not perforated by a foramen. In this respect,

therefore, the skull agrees with that of M. spasma, which inhabits part of

the same zoological region, though apparently agreeing more closely with

M. frons and M. cor. in the flattened and expanded frontals, and in the

absence of a minute upper premolar :

(captured by Mr. Wilson).

     The single specimen from which the above description- was taken, was
sent by Dr. Schuette to the Gottingen Museum, accompanied by a note

from Mr. Kreff"t on the colour of the fur and membranes in the recently

killed animal. He describes the fur on the upper surface as leaden or

slate-coloured, with greyish extremities, beneath white                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      the ears, nose-leaf,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

and membranes flesh-coloured, with the exception of the band of integu-

ment uniting the ears in front, which is deep blood-red.

This species, in comparison with the four other known species of the

genus, is really gigantic in size, exceeding the largest, namely, ill. hjra, as

much as the Noctule (Vespemgo noctula) exceeds the Pipistrelle {V.pipis-

trettus). If its habits be similar to those of M. lyra (see my Monograph

                  ' Catal. Cidropt. Brit. Mus. p. 157.
182 BKPORT--1880.

of the Asiatic Chiroptera, p. T7, 1876), it must be a very tiger among

bats, able, from its superior size, great development of the volar membranes,

and powerful canine teeth, to prey not only upon every known species of
Microchiroptera inhabiting the Australian region, but also, probably, upon

every other species of the whole sub-order, for one species only Phyllo-

= --rhina commersonii. Geoff. ( EJi. gigas. Wgnr) exceeds it in the length

of the forearm, yet in that species the forearm is disproportionately long,

and in general measurements Megaderma gigas has greatly the superiority
--it is therefore also the largest known species of Microchiroptera.

     The position of this species in the genus appears to be between M.
spasma and M. cor., but more closely related to the latter, with which it
agrees in the presence of post-orbital processes (though comparatively
very short), and in the absence of the minute first upper premolar.

     To the great liberality of Prof. Ehlers, of the Grottingen Museum, I

owe the opportunity which has been afforded me of examining and

desci'ibing the type of this most interesting species.

                                     Megaderma frons, Geoff.
    To the localities of this species add Kau, River Osi, Bast Africa
(Fischer and Peters). Heuglin (op. cit.) notices this species from the
Upper Nile, south of the fifteenth parallel of latitude, and remarks that it
occurs along the banks of streams, and in thick jungle in the tops of
trees ; that it sees well by day, and occasionally flies about in fall sun-
shine. This agrees sufficiently closely with Capt. Speke's account of the

same species quoted by me in ' Catal. Chiropt. Brit. Mus.' p. 160.

                                          Nycltris liispida, Schreb.

                                                 Xijcteris grandis, Ptrs.

     The occurrence of two perfectly adult specimens of this species in Dr.
Robb's Zanzibar Collection, not only adds a new locality, but their size
shows that the type in the Leyden Museum, and the larger specimen in
the British Museum, are but immature individuals. The following are

the measurements of an adult male :
     Length: head and body, 3" inches, tail 3", head 1"-16, ear l"-35,

tragus 0"-3 x 0"-l, forearm 2"-5, thumb 0"-65, third finger (metacarp.
1''''8, 1st ph. l"-2, 2nd ph. l"-5), fifth finger (metacarp. 2"-2, 1st ph.
0"7, 2nd ph. 0"-65), tibia l"-2, calcaneum l"-0, foot 0"-55.

    The second lower premolar in these specimens is much smaller pro-

portionately, evidently owing to the growth of the adjoining teeth, and is
crushed in between the first premolar and first molar.

                                      Nycteris mthiopica, Dobson.

     The tragus is incorrectly given ( ' Oatal. Chiropt. B. M.,' p. 165) as
narrower than that of N. javanica. It is really broader and altogether
larger, as the well-preserved specimens in Dr. Robb's collection show, the

mistake in my original description having arisen from the contracted con-
ON OUR KNOWLEDGK OF THE CHIROPTERA, ETC.                    1&3

ditiou of the tragus in the dried skins then only known. The following-
are the measurements of one of these specimens : Length : head and body
2"-3:), tail 2"-25, head 0"-9, ear 1"-15, tragus 0"-3 X 0"-15, forearm l"-95,
thumb 0"-55, third finger (metacarpal l"-4, 1st ph. l"-0, 2nd ph. l"-2),
fifth finger (metacarp. l"-65, 1st ph. 0"-5.5, 2nd ph. 0"-55), tibia 0"-9.5,

calcaneum 0"7, foot 0''-45.

Nycteris thehaica, Geofi".

     .V. angolensis, Ptrs., has been lately reported by its describer from Ndi,
Taita, north of Zanzibar, on the opposite side of the African continent from
Ano-ola. Thus it occurs in a country very close to Zanzibar, whence comes
N. °fuliginosa, Ptrs., originally described from Mozambique. In Western
Africa N. damarensis, Ptrs., from Damara-laud, appears as an intermediate
form between N. anrjoJensis from the north and N. capensis from the south.
The geographical cliain is thus completed. It is difficult to imagine such
allied forms meeting and not interbreeding freely. I have already remarked
that I do not think the size or position of the second lower premolar

(which is more or less rudimentary in all the known Ethiopian species

of the genus) of sufficient importance to found a species upon. I have
pointed out its variability in N. grandis, and I believe that the different

sizes and positions of this tooth as exhibited in the following table are

--but other examples of its variability in a single species, namely in N.

    Sir Joseph Payrer has lately sent me specimens of this bat rrom

Sutherlandshii'e; it therefore extends from the extreme south almost to
the extreme north of Great Britain, though probably not found in the

Shetlands, for Mr. Ernest Brown, now (August) visiting these islands, has

at my request particularly inquired into the presence of bats there, and

writes to me that he has never seen one since his arrival, and that the
inhabitants assure him that such animals are quite unknown there.

      This widely distributed species has also lately been recorded by Dr.
Peters from Nikko, Japan, so that it extends from the extreme west to
the extreme east of the Palaearctic Region.

     PJecohis ustus, Heuglin, is re-described in the * Reise in Nordost-
Afrika,' p. 30 (1877), but whether that (?) species really belongs to the

genus Plcrotus or not I am quite unable to judge from the description,

which omits all reference to the dental characters.

                                          Vespen^go serotinus, Schreb.

     Considering the gi'eat variability of specimens of this species, which
are occasionally found to vary more even in the same region than speci-

mens collected in very distinct zoological regions many thousands of miles

apart (for instance, specimens of the Serotine from Central America

have been found by me to present not the very least difference vyhen
compared with European examples), I am led to believe that the speci-
mens from Yunan described by me under the name of V. andersoni

(' Proc. As. Soc. Beng.' 1871, p. 211) represent but a variety or perhaps
local race only of this species.

     To the synomymy also add Vespertilio incisivus, serotinus et palustris,
Crespon, ' Faune meridionale,' p. 11 (1844), (vide Trouessart, ' Bull. Soc.
des Sci. Nat.' Nimes, fevr. 1879, p. 35) ; and for the variety, V. fuscus,

add the locality Folsom, El Dorado, California.

                                           Vesperugo borealis, Nills.

    Vegj'crvgo borealis, Dobson, ' Scientific Eesults of the Second Yarkand Mission,'
                                        --Mammalia, p. 12 (1879).

    To the description of this species (as given by me in the ' Catal.
Chiropt. Br. Mus.') may be added that a fringe of fine straight hairs

extends round the upper lip in front beneath the nostrils. This character
affords, in the case of badly preserved skins of immature specimens, an
easy method of distinguishing V. borealis from V. discolor, in which this

fringe is quite absent.

                                             Vesperugo maurus, Bias.

     In a paper, of which I have only recently been made aware by Dr.

Forsyth Major,' the identity of Vespertilio savii, Bonap. Vespertilio bona-
partii, Savi, and Vesperugo maurus, Bias, has been demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the author and of others, but as the types of the first two

named species are not forthcoming, and as the descriptions are incorrect

or insufficient, I retain Blasius' name.
     In the collection of the Gottingen Museum, I have lately found a

specimen perfectly indistinguishable from this species, which was carefully

labelled as having been sent from Popayan, in New Granada, in 1844, by

Degenhardt. The presence of a single specimen is, of course, not sufficient
ground to extend the distribution of this species to the Neotropical Region,
the Chiroptera of which (with one exception only Vesperugo serotinus, as
I have shown ^) are quite distinct from those of any of the zoological
regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. There are, however, in the same
collection, several other specimens of species, evidently Neotropical, which
are labelled ' Popayan' (to be referred to hereafter), and with which this

specimen agrees precisely in the state of preservation. It is also note-
worthy that V. 7naurus has been found in Europe at very high elevations
only, along the Alps, and in this respect the South Amertcan habitat given

                     ' In Atti della Soc. Tosc. di Sci. Nat. iii. fasc. i. Pisa, 1877.

agrees very well, for Popayan is situated on an elevated plain in the Andes,

6000 feet high.

If, then, specimens of this species have really come from such very

distinct and distant zoological regions, and exhibit so few differences,

it becomes evident that we must consider the Oriental representatives

of this species described under the names Vesperugo morelax, Ptrs., V.

pulverafus, Ptrs., and V. austenianus, Dobson, as a distinct species, which,

although agreeing remarkably in general structure and even in the colour

of the fur with V. maurus, differs in its conspicuously greater size (forearm

1""6) in the very shallow emargination in the upper half of the outer

margin of the ear-conch, in the considerably less degree in which the

extremity of the tail projects from the interfemoral membrane, and in the

much greater development of the first upper premolar, which, although

the second premolar is also clcse to the canine, may be seen without

difficulty from without.

In an interesting paper,' Sgnr. E. Regalia has noted the variations

presented by about thirty individuals of this species collected in Northern

Italy. His observations may with much advantage be attended to by

those who are inclined to found species on slight differences in structure
and colour. Among many other important differences noted by this

observer the variability in the general measurements, and in the size and

presence or absence of the first upper premolar may be especially referred

to here. In his table of measurements the length of the forearm (of which

I had given the average measurement as 1*35 inches) is shown to vary

from about 1*28 to 1"45 inches. Also both first upper premolars were

found in ten individuals ; in three the first premolar was present on the

right side only                                                                    while in one this tooth was absent on both sides.

some part of the North American continent or from the West Indies.
Mr. Matthew Jones sent the specimen to the British Museum in the same

bottle with some fishes and other specimens collected at Bermuda, but he

informed me (during my visit to him at Halifax, N.S.) that he could not

say where the bat in qviestion was obtained.

    During my visit to Bermuda, I went over Mr. Bartram's collection,

and found only specimens of Afalapha cinerea and of Vesperugo iioctiva-

gans, which he assured me were the only species of bat ever obtained in

the island.

                      Vesperugo ahramus, Temm.

     Vespertilio akohomuli, Temminck (Monogr. 'Mammal.' ii. p.' 223, pi. 57,
figs. 8, 9), was accidentally omitted in the list of synonyms of this species

(' Catal. Chiropt. B. M.' p. 226), although given as such in my ' Notes

on Dr, Severtzoffs Mammals of Turkestan ' (' Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.'

1876, p. 130). Dr. Jentink has called attention to this omission in ' Notes
from the Leyden Museum,' ii. pp. 37-40 (1879).

     Signor B. Regalia has published some interesting notes · on this
species, recorded from Italy by Dr. Forsyth Major, in which he discusses
the relative values of the characters used to distinguish it from V. pipis-

trellus.

     Dr. B. L. Trouessart has lately ^ recorded the capture, by M. Lataste,
of a specimen of this species at Cadillac, Gironde, hitherto unknown west

                                              Vesperugo huhlii, Natt.

      Pipistrellits lepidus, Blyth (' Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng.' xiv. p. 340),

and, probably, Scotophilus rusticus, Tomes (' P.Z.S.' 1861, p. 35), should be
added to the list of synomyms. According to the description of 8. rusticus,
it must come veiy close to this species, with which it agrees in dentition,
in the white margin to the wings behind, in size, &c., but this question
cannot be definitely settled without an inspection of the type, which both
Dr. Peters and the writer have in vain endeavoured to obtain from Mr.
R. F. Tomes.

     To the localities of this species add also Cadillac, Gironde (Lataste and

Trouessart)

they appear to be identical with this species.

                 Vesperngo georgianus, F. Cuv.

     Dr. Jentink having examined the types of Vespertilio erythrodactylus,

Temminck (which escaped my notice on both occasions of visiting the

Leyden Museum), has determined their identity with specimens of this

species.

With the exception of II. harpia, this is the largest known species of

the genus. In the synoptical table of the genus (' Catal. Chiropt. B. M.*

--spondiiig to the latter from Nikko, Japan, has been enabled to add the

     Owing to a mistake in the labelling of the type, I was led to assign
the Gaboon as a locality for this form, the true country of which, Mr.
Oldfield Thomas informs me, is unknown. V. hfricanus is easily distin-
guished from V. murinns by its much shorter ears, and acutely pointed
tragus, but intermediate forms may, hereafter, turn up, and the name
which has been unfortunately given may conveniently sink into the list of

synonyms.

reflected outwards as in N. stramineus, but beneath it, in front, there is, as

in the species of ChiJonycferis (PJii/lJostomiJce), but much less developed, a

small horizontal cutaneous jjrojectioti, like a second lower lip.

Wings from the tibias, at junction of middle and lower thirds. Foot

Fur, above, pale yellowish brown at the base, the terminal half reddish or

chestnut brown ; beneath, pale yellowish brown throughout. This is the

appearance of the fur in alcohol.

Upper incisors like those of N. stramineus, but the outer incisor on each

side, instead of exceeding the inner in cross-section, is equal to or even

smaller than it ; upper premolars as in that species, but the second pre-

molar is still moi'e widely separated from the third.

Crown of the head but slightly raised above the face-line ; muzzle

obliquely truncated, in general form closely resembling that of the species

of the genus Chilonycteris {Phyllostomidm), for the nostrils open widely

apart by similar circular sharply defined margins, and the lower lip is also

papillated and reflected outwards, though not so broadly, and it has not a

thin free margin ; the obtuse extremity of the rather long muzzle projects

in front considerably beyond the lower lip. Ears very large, much longer

than the head, in general outline like those of Vespertilio murinus, but the

inner margin of the conch commences in a small lobe projecting down-

wards                                    in the usual position of  the tragus or       slightly in front of      it there

Thumb with an ill-developed claw, but the whole of the inferior surface

of its metacarpal and phalangeal bones supports a large flat horse-shoe-
shaped pad, more than 0"'2 inch in diameter, whereof the circular margin
is directed forwards and slightly notched in front. The feet have also
adhesive cushions, but while resembling those of the thumbs in structure

they differ in being much smaller.

     Metacarpal bone of the index finger nearly as long as that of the

index fiftger, but there are no distinct phalanges ; third finger with three

phalanges, whereof the first and second are nearly equal in length.
     The tail projects beyond the posterior margin of the interfemoral

membrane, as in Thyroptera tricolor, but to a much greater extent, the free

portion being nearly as long as the tibia ; calcaneum long, with a very

narrow lobe notched or toothed near the foot.

    As in T. tricolor, the toes are united as far as the base of the claws,
and have each two phalanges, and the wing-membrane extends almost to

the base of the claws.

conical, and acutely pointed, but much larger than the inner one, which

lies close to it, and can hardly be discerned without a lens ; lower incisors
short and blunt, in the direction of the jaws ; first and second upper pre-

molars very short, the third exceeding the molars in vertical extent;
second lower premolar minute, in the tooth-row, the first premolar

slightly smaller than the third ; molars acutely tubercular, with W-shaped

cusps.

1st ph. 0"-5, 2nd ph. 0"-5), tibia 0"-7, calcaneum 0"-6, foot 0"-3.

Certain peculiarities in the structure of this very remarkable species

recall similar peculiarities in Thyropiera tricolor, and have evidently re-
sulted from adaptation to the same purposes. Thus in these two species
alone are the toes united to the base of the claws, and in them alone,

among all known species of bats (except the Phyllorhiniuce), have the toes

an equal number of phalanges ; they also, in the possession of a third

phalanx in the middle finger, differ from all the species of Vespertilionidce,

and from those of the allied families. This species, however, differs re-

markably from T. tricolor in the structure of the adhesive disks, in the

presence of a well-developed metacarpal bone of the second finger, in the

form of the head and ears, and in dentition, and must undoubtedly be con-

sidered the type of a distinct genus of Vespertilionidce.

The adhesive cushions of the thumbs and feet are evidently less perfect

clinging organs than the corresponding parts           in T.  tricolor                           unlike  them,
                                                                                              ;

the thumb-pads are sessile, scarcely hollow on their inferior surface, and

evidently homologous in all respects to tho.se of Vespertigo pachypus ; but

the foot-pads differ from those of that species in being much smaller and

in this respect corresponding with T. tricolor.

    It is probable that this species (in common with the few other known

species of bats provided with such accessory clinging organs') uses the

     In recording this species from Tschaka, East Africa, Dr. Peters re-
marks (' M. B. Akad. Berl.,' 1879, p. 832) that, as noted in his original
descripti'.m, there is a groove in the lower lip. To this I can only reply
that in the specimen (preserved in alcohol) in the British Mnseimi, from
Dr. Peters' collection, there is no trace of a groove in the front of the
lower lip.

     Taphozons dobsoni, Jentink (' Notes from the Leyden Museum,' 1879,

description that the species, which Dr. Jentink had been good enough to

connect my name with, was at most a variety only of T. mmiriiiamis, I

sent a specimen of that species to the Leyden Museum, and had it com-
pared with the type of T. dobsoiii. The small fleshy pads at the base of
each thumb and on the sole of the foot, noted as a specific peculiarity by

the describer, are equally present in all other species of the genus, indeed ~
in the species of most other genera of the family EuihaUonuridcc, being
particularly large in the sub-family Molossmce,^ having reference, I lielieve,
especially to progression on a flat surface, and not coming within the

class of accessory clinging organs described by me in my paper referred to

by Dr. Jentink. ^

    In November last, when dropping down the Sibun river, British Hon-
duras, by moonlight, about 6 p.m., between the tall mangroves which

crowd the banks, one of my companions in the boat (Dr. H. A. W.

Richardson, R.N.) shot a specimen of this species which was flying about
a yard or so above the surface of the smooth stream. The remains of some
of the small insects whicli were disporting themselves over the river were
found in his mouth, but the stomach was quite empty. Several specimens
of a species of Nycteribia were seen running about on the short fur. It
was pi-obably to get rid of such parasites, and not to catch shrimps, that
the individuals observed by Mr. Fraser (see ' Catal. Chiropt. B.M.,' p. 397)
occasionally struck the water as they flew along.

    Heuglin (' Reise in N.-O. Afrika,' 1877, ii. p. 24) has described as new

BJi. cordofanicum, which he distinguishes as being larger than this species.
The measurements given, however, are considerably less than those of the
type of this species, and I have no doubt that this species, as well as those
described by him in conjunction with Pitzinger (' Sitzungb. Akad. Wien,'
1866), namely, Bh. senaarense and Bh. Jonr/icaudatum, are also referable to

this species.

    From the description {op. cit. p. 28), it would appear to me that the

names Dysopes talpinus and hepaticus, Heuglin, must be considered syno-
nyms of this species, which is so closely related to N. p>licatus that it can
scarcely be regarded as more than a local race of that species.

of-au-hour after snnsct ; their flight is remarkablj- rapid. Thanks to

Mr. Edward Newton, wlio shot several for me, I was able to examine
them in the recent state, and found that in all the fur was tinged with

reddish-yellow, a colour never observed by me in dried skins.

      This remarkable species also occurs in the environs of Kingston, and
a specimen with exceedingly brilliantly coloured fur of a golden chestnut
hue was shot by Mr. Newton.

     The British Museum has lately received a specimen of this extraor-

dinary species from New Granada, collected by Mr. Fry. Hitherto the

species was represented by a single specimen, the type in the collection of

the museum of the Army Medical Department, of which the locality was
uncertain, but from collateral evidence, believed by me to be Trinidad, a
supposition now rendered extremely probable. This second specimen

differs in no important respect from the type.

     This appears to be by far the commonest species of bat in Jamaica.
I found it abundant in every cave visited by me, inhabiting the honey-
comb-like cells in the white limestone. The floor of these caves is covered

to the depth of many feet with their dung, which forms a soft black mass,

in which near the entrances a few sickly plants of the bread-imt were
always found vegetating, having sprang up from the rejected kernels of
that fi-uil, which appears to form the greater part of their food. At

Kind's House, near Kingston, Mr. Newton pointed out to me on the floor

of the bath-room the remains of these fruits, which the bats carried in at
night-time, to feed upon at leisure, while they hung themselves from the
ratters. At the same place, about midday, we forced an individual to
quit his home in a hollow mango tree, but he flew only as far as the next
tree, where he was scon secured. In him the fur was strongly tinged

with yellow, over the shoulder especially, so that when flying forth from
his retreat I thought it was a specimen of Noctilio leporimis. In this re-

spect this individual contrasted remarkably with all the cave-haunting
specimens I had examined, for in them the colour of the fur appeared to
be almost quite uniform, namely, dai-k brown in the terminal third, the
extreme tips of the hairs greyish, the basal three-fourths pale greyish
bi'own ; beneath the greater part of the hairs uniooloured greyish brown,

paler towards the extremities. The facial streaks were more or less
defined in all the individuals captured by me.

    An adult male specimen, also from Popayan, in the collection of the

Gcittingen Museum, has the facial streaks faintly marked, thus showing
that the development of these marks are probably as variable as I have
already noticed in the case of Artiheus pJanirostris. There is also a very
faint white line along the spine, which is absent in the type. The
peculiar form of the first lower premolar is, however, as well marked as

in the type.

Preliminary Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. E.
   Ayrton {Secretary), Dr. 0. J. Lodge, Mr. J. E. H. Gordon, and

   Mr. J. Perry, appointed for the purpose of accurately measuring

   the specific inductive capacity of a good Spjrengel Vacuuvi, and

    the specific resistance of gases at diferent pressures.

In 1870 two of the members of your present Committee concluded, from
theoretical reasons, based on the analogy between the viscous yielding of
bodies to mechanical stress and the absorption of the electric charge in a
Leyden jar, that some connection of an inverse order would be found to
exist between the specific inductive capacities and the specific resistances
of dielectrics. As at that time it was only for gutta percha and india-
rubber that the specific resistances had been measured, it was necessary,
in order to put the theory to the test of experiment, to carefully measure
the specific resistances of several other dielectrics of which the specific
inductive capacities were known. The substances selected were paraffin-
wax, shell lac, mica, ebonite, &c., and it was found that, in a general way,
if bodies were arranged in increasing order of specific inductive capacity,
they would be found arranged in decreasing order of specific resistance.'

     Again, since different gases had different indices of refraction for light,
it was felt that Faraday's not having succeeded in finding experimentally
different specific inductive capacities for the various gases, must have
arisen from the comparative roughness of his apparatus ; and very delicate
experiments undertaken in consequence, showed that hydrogen had a
decidedly less specific inductive capacity than air, and that carbonic

dioxide, coal gas, sulpliuric dioxide, &c., a decidedly greater. Lastly,

since tlie resistance of a gas to disruptive discharge varied with tLe pres-

--sure, it was anticipated also in opposition to the results of Faraday's

--experiments that the specific inductive capacity of even the vacuum of

an ordinary air-pump must be slightly different from unity, a conclusion

also subsequently verified by experiment.'

The method employed for that investigation which was cariied out in

Japan consisted in using two condensers, one an open air condenser of

adjustable capacity, the other a closed condenser into which any gas at

any pressure could be jjut. The open air condenser was adjusted to have

the same capacity as the closed one when the latter was filled with air at

the ordinary pressure and temperature                                                                                                                                                                                                           then the change in capacity of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

latter when tbe pi-essure of the air inside was diminished, or when another

gas was introduced, could be determined by changing the insulated coat-

ings of these two condensers to equal and opposite potentials, discharging

thera into one another, and measuring the resultant potential Avith a

Thomson's quadrant electrometer adjusted for great sensibility.

Previously, however, to this, but quite unknown to these members of

your Committee, Prof Boltzmann had made a similar investigation, using,

however, a different method of experimenting. The results obtained in

the two independent investigations for the same gases are placed under-

neath side by side, and the fairly close agreement, considering the extreme

delicacy of the experiments, make it quite certain that the general bearing

of the experinients is correct :

     Tbe gases were at 760 mm. pressure ; the vacuum varied from about
10 mm. to somewhat gi"eater pressures. The observation for sulphuric

dioxide is given, as it is the highest specific inductive capacity yet ob-

tained for any gas.
      The very peculiar behaviour of a good Sprengel A-acuum in resisting

the passage of an induction spark led to tbe formation of this Committee,
to investigate, with the aid of a grant from the Association, the specific

inductive capacity of a far higher vacuum than had been employed in
either of the two preceding investigations since Messrs. Ayrton and Perry
predicted that such a vacuous space would be found to have a capacity

very considerably smaller than if filled with ordinary air.

     The closed condenser in this case consists of five aluminium cylinders
39-3 ceiitimetres long, placed concentrically at about ^ centimetre apart,
in a glass tube .58'5 centimetres long and 5"5 centimetres in diameter.
The second and fourth cylindci-s form the insulated coating, and the first,
third, and fifth the earth coating. The cylinders comprising eaeli coating
are rigidly connected at each end with a thin platinum rod, and these
platinum rods, like the cylinders, do not touch the glass tube, but are held
in position by a thin glass rod, one end of which is fused to the platinum

rod and the otlier to tlie inside of the g]ass tube. To give, in a small

space, length to these glass rods, for obtaining surface insulation, they

are made zigzag, and in the form of a flat spiral. To the thin platinum
rods are attached two fine platinum wires, which form the two electrodes
of the condenser, and where these pass out through the glass tube, glass
is fused on to the wire both inside and outside, as in the figure, to increase

the surface insulation.

     The area that one set of aluminium cylinders exposes

to the other is about 1800 square centimetres, so that the
electrostatic capacity is about 450 centimetres in absolute

units, or ^o^ of a microfarad.
   A small spiral glass tube connects the condenser with

a three-fall-tube Sprengel pump, and as the internal ca-

pacity of the condenser is large, it was thought desirable End of Condenser,

to attach to the pump an Alvergniat or Geissler arrange-

ment to enable the pressure to be rapidly reduced to about 10 cen-

timetres of mercury. A barometer gauge and a McLeod gauge are

attached to the pump. The entire glasswork in the apparatus was made

by Mr. Gimingham, and the Committee desire to express their thanks

for the assistance he has so kindly given.                   is the alu-

  -- AMethod of Experimenting. In the accompanying figure,

minium condenser just described, the interior not being shown in the

Bfigure ; is Sir William Thomson's ' sliding condenser,' kindly lent by

him to the Committee. This, as is well known, consists of a brass tube,

I, about 38 centimetres long and 5'08 centimetres in external diameter,

attached at one end to an ebonite collar, d d, by

which it is supported and insulated. Outside and       'fTOf"^'

inside this brass tube, but without touching it,

slide two other tubes, T, and T^, electrically con-

nected with the outer tube T-^ and with the earth.

The motion of the tube Tj forms a coarse adjust-

ment, and that of the tube T2 a fine adjustment of

the capacity of the condenser. On account of the

action of the edges it would be somewhat difficult

to calculate the whole capacity of this condenser
for any given position of the tubes, but it is com-

paratively easy to calculate the change of capacity

produced by moving either tube a known distance

measured on the fine linear scale engraved on each

of the sliding tubes.

    As the capacity of this condenser, when the

tube r, is in its mean position, is considerably less

than that of the aluminium condenser, another air-

condenser, C, having a fixed capacity about equal to the difference, was

constructed. B, then, could be adjusted so that its capacity, together with

Athat of C, was equal to that of A, when contained air at ordinary pi'es-.

sure. Then any change in the capacity of A, produced by exhausting the

Bair, could be measured by finding the new adjustment of necessaiy ta

produce balance.

The mode of testing the equality of capacities was suggested by one

of the Committee, Dr. Lodge, and consisted of a modification of Prof.

Hughes' Induction Balance. Z is a coil of wire of about 3 ohms' resist-

«,u<5e, in which the current from two or three Grove's cells, P, flows in-
200 REPOKT 1880.

tennitteutly, the circuit being alternately made and broken by a clock, M.

ic, ij arc perfectly similar coils of about 800 ohms' resistance each, and
adjusted in position relatively to Z, so that when the condensers on the
two sides of the balance have perfectly equal capacity no sound is heard
in an especially delicate telephone, T, when the connections are made as

in the figure. It will be observed that the nature of the arrangement is

Asuch that any failure of insulation in would make it appear to have too

large a capacity and not too small, as would be the case with the method

of experimenting previously described.

     For air at pressures gi'eater than one millimetre, the Committee have

not thought it necessary to make many experiments, but between 001
and 0001 of a millimetre pressure several sets of expeinments have been

--carried out. At the latter pressure that is, at about one-millionth of an
--atmosjDhere the specific inductive capacity is certainly low, some experi-

ments apparently making it as much as 0-6 to 08 per cent, less than that

for ordinaiy air, whereas the greatest diminution obtained for an air-
vacuum in the two previous investigations, when the pressure was not

diminished lower than 5 millimetres, was only O'l per cent. In all the sets

of experiments for very low pressures there are decided waves in the curves

connecting capacity and pressure, but whether these waves really express

a physical law, or whether they are due to the method of experimenting

witb currents of very short duration, or whether, lastly, they are due to
the capacity not depending solely on the pressure, but also on the amount

of residual gas occluded in the aliminium cylinders, the Committee have

not yet ascertained, and therefore in this preliminary report they refrain

Afrom giving the curves.  sample of the observations, however, may be

result constantly obtained when very small pressures were employed, and

wliicli may Lave arisen from the effect of tlio remanent occluded gas, there

also appears to be a sudden diminution of the capacity at about O'lO mil-

limetre pressure. To make sure that this was not an accidental result,

the air was pumped out again when the pressure was about 3 millimetres

until it was reduced again to about O'l millimetre, when the same dimi-

nution of capacity at about 0'19 was again observed. Now although

these numbers are merely now given as a preliminary indication of the

results obtained by the Committee, there is this interest about them, as

has been pointed out by Mr. G. F. Fitzgerald of Dublin, that the values

obtained for the capacity between about 002 and 02 millimetre's pressure
....bear a gOeneral resemblance to those obtained for the Crookes' force.
mOne difficulty met with in the investigation consists  an apparent

Bchange in the capacity of the condensers and G (partly, no doubt, aris-

Aing from changes of temperature) from day to day.  similar difficulty

was met -with in the previous investigation made in Japan, but it was

overcome by making alternate measurements of the capacity of the closed

condenser, first with air, then with vacuum, then with air, &c., &c. In

the present case this is, of course, impossible, since on account of the large

internal capacity of the condenser A, and the considerable quantity of

gas occluded in so large a mass of aluminium, it takes several days to

obtain a vacuum of 0001 of a millimetre even, although, at the suggestion

of Mr. Gimingham, induction sparks from a large induction coil (not

shown in the figure), are kept passing between the two sets of aluminium

cylinders at all times that a measurement of capacity is not being made.

Probably the best method of procedure is that followed on August 28, the

last day of the investigation, viz., first obtain slowly a very perfect vacuum,

no measurements of capacity being necessarily made, then admit into the

pump, drop by drop, mercury, occluding air, and make, during a couple of

hours or so, a complete series of measurements of capacity as the pres-

sure rises from, say, 0"001 of a millimetre up to ordinary atmospheric

pressure. Such a set of experiments being performed several times would
probably give a fair indication of tbe curve for capacity. As it is also

extremely desirable that the experiments should be made with statical

charges of electricity, the Committee have had constructed a somewhat

modified form of Thomson's quadrant electrometer, which they also pro-

--pose employing for the measurement of the specific resistance of gas at

different pressures the second half of their work, which they have not

yet commenced.

During the month of March, 1879, there were several very considerable
magnetic disturbances, and therefore there were several favourable oppor-
tunities for comparing the effects of magnetic disturbances at different

stations wherever photographic records similar to those at Kew are

obtained.

Mr. Whipple was accordingly instructed by the Kew Committee to

write to the various observatories where declination magnetograpLs are

photographed, to ask thsLt fac-siviiles of the records taken at those stations

might be sent to the Kew Committee for compai'ison.

In answer to this request, Dr. Hann, Director of the Observatory at

Vienna, and Senlior Capello, Director of the Observatory at Lisbon, have

kindly lent the original negatives, and Rev. Prof. S. J. Perry, Director

of the Observatory at Stonyhurst, and Dr. Da Souza, Director of the

Observatory at Coimbra, have kindly forwarded positives printed from

their original curves, and Dr. "Wild, Director of the St. Petersburg Obser-

vatory, has kindly forwarded very careful tracings of the St. Petersburg

photographs. These have been compared with one another, and with

the original negatives taken at the Kew Observatory, and much valuable

information has already been obtained. Other records have been asked,

but a sufficient time has not yet elapsed for them to come to hand ; it is
hoped that, as soon as they arrive, a complete discussion of them will

greatly extend our knowledge as to the causes of magnetic disturbances

over a considerable area of the earth's surface.

   A disturbance began at 4.20 a.m., Greenwich time, on the 3rd of March,

1879, which is described in the Stonyhurst record as ' a tremulous motion

of the declination magnet, which lasted for about thirteen hours, accom-

panied by a gradual increase of westerly declination.'

About 5.80 a.m. the agitations west and east became greater, and at

7.30 a.m. there were sudden and great disturbances, the maximum

westerly declination being reached about 8 a.m. : again marked dis-

turbances, not quite so sudden, occurred just before 10 o'clock; then,

after a slight motion eastward until 10.30 a.m., there was again an increase

in the westerly declination, accompanied by great agitations, until 1 p.m.,

after which there is a decrease in the westerly declination, and the dis-

turbance ends at about 5 p.m.

During the whole time of this increase in the westerly declination

the agitations of the declination needle, including some twenty-four

maxima and minima values, ai'e absolutely coincident in time, and very

often equal in magnitude, at Kew and at St. Petersburg.
    At Stonyhurst also the curves are coincident with those at Kew

and are silmost facsimiles of them.

    On comparing the jihotographs at Coimbra and at Lisbon with those
at Kew -and at St. Petersburg, it is found that the agitations in Portugal

are not so clearly marked, but are coincident in time with those at the

other stations.

Comparing the Vienna photographs of the same disturbance with

those at Kew, they are found to be almost facsimiles of one another

every agitation westward or eastward at one place is coincident in time

with a similar agitation at the other. The Vienna jDhotographs are

remarkably clear, but the agitations are usually not so large as those at

Kew, and both are usually less than those at St. Petersburg, as given by

the tracings                                                        but the forms and periods of the successive agitations  in  a
                                                                 ;

disturbance, as well as the duration of the disturbances, are the same at all

the stations.

     Between 5 and 6 p.m. on the 3rd there was a disturbance, first east-

ward and then westward, at St. Petersburg, which was not felt at Kew
         ON CURVES OF DECLINATION MAGNETOGRAPHS, ETC.                                                                                               203

and between 10 p.m. and 12 there wei-e simultaneous disturbances at

Kew and St. Petersburg, but in opposite directions.

     From about 10 to 10.40 p.m. there is a disturbance of a very regular

kind, i.e. without much agitation, consisting of a motion of the needle

towards the east, followed by a motion of the needle westward for about

half an hour. This disturbance is strongly marked at Kew and at

Stonyhurst; is less strongly marked, but coincident in time, at Coimbra

and  at  Lisbon                                   and  also  very  well  shown,                                              but  is  small, in  the Vienna

photographs ; but in the tracing from St. Petersburg a disturbance

begins at the same point of absolute time (i.e. about 10 p.m. Greenwich

--time), with a motion of the needle towards the ivest this motion west-

ward lasts for about 20 minutes, until 10.20 p.m., and is then followed by

a gradual motion eastward until about 10.45 p.m.

     The declination at St. Petersburg then remains nearly steady for a

quarter of an hour, whilst the westerly declination at the other stations

is regularljr increasing, and from 11.30 p.m. (Greenwich time) the dis-

turbances at St. Petersburg coincide in direction and in time with those

at Kew and at the other stations.

     Plate VII., fig. 1, represents the St. Petersburg, Kew, and Vienna

declination curves for March 3rd, the time being Greenwich mean time

for all stations.

     On referring to the Kew curves for the horizontal force, of which Mr.

Whipple has kindly prepared tracings for me, I find that whenever the

deflections of the declination needle are eastward at Kew and westward

at St. Petersburg at the same instant, as in this disturbance between 10

and 10.20 p.m., there is at the same time an increase in the horizontal

force ; and when the deflections are westward at Kew and eastward at

St. Petersburg at the same instant, as l)"t\veen 10.20 p.m. and 10.45 p.m.,

there is at the same time a decrease going on in the horizontal force.

     This statement is borne out by the comparisons of disturbances on

other days throughout the month.

     Three easterly movements of the needle occurred between 3 and 8 p.m.

on the 5th of March.

     One began about 2.45 p.m., which is only just noticeable at Lisbon

and Coimbra when looked for, but which is clearly seen in the Kew and

Stonyhurst jjhotographs, and becomes much more important at Vienna,

and  is  much larger still at St.                            Petersburg                                                      but at all places the  gi-eatest
                                                                                                                          ;

easterly declination occurs at the same absolute time (at about 3 p.m.

Greenwich time), and there is then an increase in the westerly declination

iintil about 3.30 p.m.

From 5 p.m. to 5.20 p.m. there is an easterly movement of the

needle, which is absolutely coincident in time and is well marked at all

the stations, and the amount of the disturbance is as great at Kew and at

Stonyhurst as it is at St. Petersburg. This is followed by a westerly

movement, which is also precisely similar at all the places.

Another similar easterly movement begins about 6.20 p.m. (Green-

wich time) at all the stations, and lasts for a quarter of an hour,

followed by an equal movement westward for the next quarter of an

hour, thus forming a regular \/ in the photograjjhic curves. The

second side of this \J is continued to double the length in the St. Peters-
burg tracings, but the following greatest eastward declination is reached at
204 KEPORT-- 1880.

the same time (about 7. "20 p.m.) at all tbc stations. Theu the needle

gradually returns to the westward, and the disturbance dies away.

This deviation of the St. Petersburg curves from the others occurs at

6.40 p.m., at which time there is a sudden increase in the horizontal

force.

     Another considerable disturbance, consisting of a general eastward

movement of the north end of the needle, began about 6 p.m. on the 7th,
followed by a westward movement, which ceased about 10 p.m.

     In this disturbance, as in others, the Lisbon and Coimbra curves are

like exact reproductions of one another, so also are the Kew and Stony-

hurst curves. Placing the Lisbon negative behind the Coimbra positive,

the dark lines of the Lisbon photograph are seen through the bright

lines   of  the Coimbra  curves                                  and  in  the  same  way,  placing  the  Kew
                                                              ;

negative behind the Stony hurst positive, the dark lines of the Kew curves

are seen to coincide with the bright lines of the Stonyhur.st cui-ves, just

as if one were an exact print taken from the other.

    Comparing the Kew and the \'icnna curves this disturbance is found

to be of precisely' flic same cliaracter at both stations, but its range at
Vienna is less than at Kew. In this case the periods of the disturbance

occur at the same absolute time at all the stations.
     At St. Petersburg Ihe disturbance at the beginning is also similar in

character to that at Kew, but previously at 2 p.m. (Greenwich time),

there had been an easterly disturbance at St. Petersburg, which was not

perceived at Kew; and just before 8 p.m., towards the end of the great
disturbance, the westerly range of the needle is very much greater at

St. Petersburg than at Kew, but the needle reaches its extreme positions

either west or east exactly at the same absolute time at the two, and,

indeed, at all the stations.

     Unfortunately at Coimbra four curves are drawn on the same slip,
and the zero line for one curve frequently runs into and coincides witli

the curve for another dnj, so that it is difficult or impossible to make out

the character of the disturbances. The distance between the curve and

the zero line appears to be the same as in the Kew curves.

     At Stonyhnrst three curves are photographed on the same slip, but

the difficulty of dealing with the Coimbra curves is avoided by placing

the zero or time line a long way from its own curve, but the curves for

different days are placed so close to one another that occasionally they

are apt to run into and confuse or cross one another.

At Kew, at Lisbon, and at St. Petersburg, two curves are drawn on

the same slip, and sufficiently far apart not to interfere with one another,

the distance at St. Petersburg being greater than at Kew, because, as a

rule, the disturbances are of larger amount than at Kew.

At Vienna each curve is photographed on a separate slip, and the

hours ai-e numbered astronomically from to 23, the slip being changed

at or just before 21 hr., or 9 a.m. local time, i.e. about 8 a.m. Greenwich

time.

The Vienna plan of photographing each curve on a separate sheet is

the most convenient of all for the comparison of disturbances at different

places, and there is an additional advantage in this plan because when

there are two or more curves on a slip, disturbances occurring at the same

hour on two successive days are not vertically above one another, and the

·want of agreement of the time lines for two or more curves is apt to be

confusing.
ON CURVES OF DECLINATION MAGNETOGRAPHSi, ETC.  205

    From the Stonyliurst report Ave find that ' the chief disturbance of the
month began about noon on the 9th, and lasted till 4 a.m. on the follow-

ing day.'

    On comparing the Lisbon and Coimbra curves for the aa hole period of

this disttirbance, they are found to be absolutely coincident throughout.

    On comparing the Kevv and Stonyhurst curves, they are also found to

be absolutely coincident, both in I'ange of disturbances and in time ; indeed,
this is one of the most remarkable instances that I have seen.

     At Vienna the disturbances are nearly all of the same character, and
take place at the same time, but the i'ange is not quite so great.

    On comparing the St. Petersburg curves, it is found that there are

disturbances of the same character, and taking place i.e. having their

maxima and minima--at the same time as those at Kew and Vienna and

the other stations ; but superposed upon these are other disturbances, one
to the eastward fi-om 2 to 3.20 p.m., and to the vrestward from 8.20 to
3.40 p.m. ; another violent one to the eastv^ard from 4.20 to 4.50 p.m.,
followed by a quicker retui-n to the westward until 5 p.m. ; another, not
quite so violent, eastward from 6 to 6.30, and westward from 6.30 to

7 p.m. ; then, after a period of comparative rest, at 10.20 there is another
disturbance westward for about ten minutes, followed by a i-eturn of
the needle to the eastward until 11 p.m., superposed on those dis-
turbances which are the same as the disturbances which are seen in the

Kew curves.

     The effect of these extra disturbances, which are so marked at St,
Petersburg, is only just seen in the Vienna curves, the result being that
the heights of some of the maxima are diminished or increased, or the

slopes of parts of the curves are slightly altered, in consequence of the
action of opposing or reinforcing disturbances.

     These differences in the disturbances at St. Petersburg and at the
other stations coincide in time with corresponding changes in the value

of the horizontal force, as measured by the Kew curves. Thus from 2 to

3.20 p.m. the horizontal force is diminishing, then from 3.20 to 3.40 p.m.
the horizontal force is increasing ; from about 4.15 to 4.45 p.m. the hori-
zontal force is diminishing, but again increases more rapidly until 5 p.m.;
then from 6 to 6.20 p.m. it diminishes, and afterwards increases more
slowly until a little after 7 p.m.; after a period of rest there is a large in-
crease from 10.15 to 10.35, followed by a diminution of the horizontal
force until 11 p.m.

   --It thus appears from these comparisons and the statements are fully
--borne out by the other principal disturbances which have been examined

     that

    A diminution in the horizontal force is accompanied by greater easterly

deflections of the declination needle at St. Petersburg than at Kew.
2. Increase of the horizontal force is accompanied by greater westerly
deflections at St. Petersburg than at Kew, or is sometimes accompanied
by a westerly deflection at St. Petersburg and an easterly deflection at
Kew.

     On March 11, a disturbance, first eastward for a quarter of an hour

until 9 p.m., then westward for an hour, causes a well-mai'ked and regular

depression in the declination curve.

     This takes place at the same instant at Kew, Stonyhurst, and Vienna,

but is not present at St. Petersburg; but at the time of the greatest
eastward deflection, at 9.4 p.m., there is a slight westward deflection at
206 REPORT~1880.

St. Petersburg, tlie otlier small disturbances at all the places being tlie

same.
     Again, on the 13th, there is a magnetic storm, lasting from G.20 p.m.

until 8 p.m., which takes place absolutely at the same time at all tlie
stations, and for which the curves for places near together absolutely fit

one another.

    At St. Petei'sburg tliis storm was more violent than at the otlicr
stations, and was preceded by a violent storm, iu which the needle de-
viated first to the cast and then to the west, between 4.20 and 6 p.m.
This preceding storm was only slightly felt at the other stations, and

rather more at Vienna than at Kew or Stonyhurst.

     About 2.30 a.m. on the 14th, there is a sudden disturbance of the

needle to the westward, which is stronger at Kew and Stonyhurst than at

Vienna or at St. Petcvsburg.
     The nest considerable disturbance was on the 15th, beginning at

9.20 p.m. and ending at midnight, followed by lesser disturbances arising
from a distinct cause which lasted until 4 a.m. on the 16th.

     This disturbance from 9.20 p.m. to midnight produced similar deflec-

tions at Kew and Stonylmrst, and also at Coimbra and Lisbon, first rapidly

to the east until 9.50 and then to the west ; but tiie range was not so great
at these latter places. At St. Petersburg the deflections of the needle

were in the opposite direction to those at Kew and Stonyhurst, and the

opjjosite deflections occurred at the same time ; and this remark applies to
all the oscillations of the declination needle up to midnight. The dis-

turbance westward was also much greater than the simultaneous eastward
disturbance at Kew.

     The disturbances between midnight and 4 a.m. take place at the same
time at all the stations, and are precisely similar in character and in
direction at St. Petersburg, at Vienna, and at Kew. They are also equal
in amount, so that the curves almost fit one another. Here, then, we have

a cause producing opposite disturbances at Kew and at St. Petersbin-g

for more than two hours, followed by probably some other cause of dis-
turbance producing identical effects at all the stations for a period of four

hours.

     At Vienna from 9.20 to midnight the disturbances were simultaneously
in the same direction as, but were very weak in comparison with, those
at St. Petei'sburg, so that this magnetic storm was very little felt at

Vienna.

    On reveri5ing the Kew curve for this disturbance and comparing it

with St. Petersburg, it is seen that the successive maxima and minima
are absolutely simultaneous, so that the deflections opposite ways at the
two places are seen to be due to the same cause ; and the Vienna curve is
very nearly coincident with the mean curve obtained by superposing the

Kew and St. Peterslmrg curves.

     Plate VII., fig. 2, represents the St» Petersburg, Kew, Vienna, and
Coimbi-a declination curves for March 15th-lGth.

     The beginning of this disturbance was accompanied by a sudden and
large increase of the horizontal force until 9.50 p.m., and then by a dimi-
nution until 10.45 p.m., followed by slight oscillations of the needle until
midnio-ht, which are simultaneous with the oscillations of the St. Peters-

burg declination needle.
      The vertical force gradually diminishes from 9.20 to 10.30 p.m.
      Nothing can show move clearly than this the direct relation between
         ON CDRVKS Of DKCLINATION MAGNETOGUAPHS, ETC.                  207

the changes in the horizontal force and the differences in the declination
curves at St. Petersburg and at Kew.

At 11.45 a.m. on March 18 there is a sudden kick to the westward,

lasting for about t-\vo minutes and measured by a length of 2 millimetres
Kewon the
           curve, i.e. giving a deflection of about 2'. This kick takes

place simultaneously at St. Petersburg and at Vienna, and is nearly equal

at all the stations. It is also felt at the same instant at Coimbra and at

Lisbon.

A similar kick, but less marked at St. Petersburg, occurs next day at

11.30 a.m. (Greenwicli time) at all the stations.

     After an entire agreement between the curves through the day, at 10

p.m. a disturbance occurs wliicb deflects the needle eastward at Kew and

westward at St. Petersburg, but by midnight the cui-ves coincide again,
and remain coincident with the same very small variations through the

night.

    Between 3 and 4 p.m. on March 20 we get disturbances opposite ways,

first westward at Kew and eastward at St. Petersburg simultaneously,

again followed by coincidences through the day.

     Another disturbance commenced    by a tremulous  motion  of  the  mao°-net

about 7 a.m. on the 23rd, and lasted  until 11 p.m.

From the beginning of this storm until 1.45 p.m. the several east and

west disturbances or oscillations of the needle are simultaneous and of the

same character, and are verj nearly equal in amount at Kew, Stonyhurst,

and at St. Petersburg. From 1.45 to 2.30 p.m. the deflections to the

eastward were far greater at St. Petersburg than at the other stations,

but were still simultaneous at all the stations. The record at Stonyhurst

shows that the vertical force increased in value about 2 p.m., so that here

an increase in the vertical force is accompanied by greater eastward deflec-

tions at St. Petersburg.

    The St. Petersburg curve remains below the Kew and Stonyhurst

curves, with the same smaller disturbances, until 7.12 p.m., just

after one but before another violent disturbance, each of which 'lasted
half an hour. The first of these two violent disturbances was first east-
ward and then westward at all stations, but greater at St. Petersburg
than at Kew, and was accompanied by a con-esponding decrease, and

then an increase of the horizontal force. At 7.25 p.m., accordino- to

the Stonyhm-st record, the V.F. had diminished to its mean value, 'and

simultaneously with this diminution the horizontal force had been in-
creasing. The second violent disturbance was westward at St. Peters-

burg, and eastward at Kew and Stonyhurst. This second disturbance

mumwas also westward at Vienna, but less violent in character. The maxi-

         was reached at 7.30 p.m.

The simultaneous disturbances become alike again in character and

direction at 7.50 p.m., but from 8.15 p.m. until 11 p.m. (the end of the

storm) the disturbances at Kew and at St. Petersburg do not correspond,

but are at times in opposite directions. From 11 p.m. the curves are

again agreeing with one another.

The time scales for different stations are nearly but not quite the
same
      ; the St. Petersburg is    slightly shorter than the  Kew scale, and the
Kew   is slightly sliorter than
                                 the Vienna scale. They     are so nearly equal

that for short lengths the difference is not perceptible. In Plate VIII.,
fig. 1, where tlie disturbances daring seventeen hours on March 23-24 are

represented ia one diagram, an attempt has been made to guide the eye by
208 RLPOUT-- 1880.

drawing three oblique time lines at 9 a.m., 8 p.m., and 2 a.m. tln-ough the
St. Petersburg, Kew, and Vienna curves. There is more difficulty in
determining tlie exact instant at which any small disturbance occurs from
the Lisbon photographs, as the curves are not divided into hourly or two-

hourly divisions as at the other observatories.

    From 7.20 to 7.30 p.m. there is a sudden and large increase in the

horizontal force, which continues high until 7.40, and then suddenly

diminishes until nearly 8 p.m.

     On March 28, at 4.30 p.m., a slight eastward distui-bance takes place
at St. Petersburg, which is scarcel}^ perceived elsewhere. From 10.20 to

10.30 at all the stations the declination needle is moving westward, and

both the horizontal and vertical forces at Kew are increasing. From

10.30 to 10.40 the St. Petersburg needle continues to move west\vai-d,

and the horizontal and vertical forces continue to increase, but the Kew

needle moves back to the eastward fron 10.30 p.m. until 11.5 p.m., and
then westward to 11.30 p.m. From 10.20 p.m. to 1.25 a.m. on the 29th,

during which time there are two large distiarbances, there is a very close

resemblance between the St. Petersburg declination curve and the Kew

horizontal force curve, the disturbances being simultaneous, and a westerly

deflection at St. Petersburg corresponding to an increase of the horizontal

force at Kew. Taking the mean line of no disturbance as common to the
two, the hei<'-ht or depth of the Kew horizontal force curve is about one-

third of the height or depth of the St. Petersburg declination curve at

the same point.

     Plate IX. gives the St. Petersburg, Kew, and Vienna declination

curves and the horizontal and vertical force at Kew from 10 p.m. to

4 a.m. on March 28-29.

The Vienna curve is very nearly the mean between the St. Petersburg-

and Kew declination curves between 10.30 and 11.30 p.m., but agrees abso-

lutely with the Kew curve for the part of the disturbance after midnight.

This disturbance was only slightly felt at Lisbon or at Coimbra.

According to the Stonyhursb record, the horizontal force magnet was

rather disturbed during the.'^e declination disturbances.

On the next day (March 29), at 8.20 p.m., an e:isterly excursion begins,

which  is  identical  at  all  stations  until  8.45  p.m.                        but  at  this  point  the
                                                                               ;

St. Petersburg needle turns sharply back to the Avest, while the Kew and

Stonyhurst needles continue moving to the east, giving the greatest eastern

deflection for the month (15' 49")- This point is reached at 8.55 p.m.,

whilst the corresponding western deflection at St. Petersburg is reached

about 9.5 p.m. The St" Petersburg curve then falls again, reaching its
lowest point at 9.30 p.m., after which the curves show a westward motion

of the needles at all stations.

     In Plate VIII., fig. 2, the time lines are drawn obliquely, as in the

curve for March 23-24.
     The Vienna curve is almost exactly the mean of the other two curves,

and the Lisbon and Coioibra curves very closely resemble the Vienna

curve for this disturbance.

     About 10.40 and again at 11.15 p.m. the St. Petersburg needle is de-

flected to the west, and the Kew needle toward the cast. The St. Peters-
burg needle reaches its maximum at 11.30 p.m., then both needles move
eastiwai-d until 12.10 a.m., after which the Kew needle begins to move

westward. At 12.30 a.m. the St. Petersburg needle also begins to

move westward, the curves very closely agree, and the disturbance is

veiy nearly over.

        On July 19, before seeing the Kew horizontal force curves, I wrote as
   follows : / am led to conjecture that at 8.45 p.m. on the 29th, and at 11.15

   p.m., there is an increase in the horizontal force.

        On comparing the Kew horizontal force curves I find that from 8.45

   to 9.5 p.m. the horizontal force is inci'easing rapidly, and that it decreases
   again from 9.5 to 9.30 p.m. At 10.40 the horizontal force again increases,
   and after a slight decrease about 11 o'clock, there is again an increase in

   the horizontal force, beginning at 11.15 p.m., and ending at 11.30 p.m.,
   i.e., when the St. Petersburg declination needle reaches its greatest
   westerly deviation.

        On comparing an exceedingly good photograph from Vienna for March

   26-27, with the photograph from Kew, which is also good, in a disturbance
   lasting from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., in which there were twelve distinct deflec-
   tions in each direction and a decided character given to the curve, but in
   which no excursion was as great as 2' from the mean position, I fovmd
   that the curves were absolutely coincident.

       The Stonyhurst positives agreed with Kew as far as one could judge,
   but the agreements between the Kew and Vienna curves here spoken of

   are such as are entirely beyond the power of testing by a positive. Almost
   the whole of the Vienna photograph of the disturbance lies within the
   breadth of the base line in the Stonyhurst positive. The oscillations are

   also found to take place absolutely at the same instant of time at Kew

   and at Vienna. Similar instances occur on March 31 between 12 and
   1 p.m. and between 6 and 7 p.m.

        The St. Petersburg tracings also show the same disturbances occurring

   at the same times, but the agreement of these Vienna and Kew

   curves is far greater than any that can be tested by means of tracings ; at
   the same time, there are numberless instances of comparison which might
   be given which .show that the St. Petersburg tracings are remarkably
   good. They are also taken on a very excellent tracing paper, and the
   hours are carefully marked on the curves, so that there is no difficulty in
   arriving at the time at which any given disturbance occurs.

        Tt would be easier to make accurate measurements of time if the base

   line were nearer to the curve than it is in the Vienna photographs, and if
   only one curve were photographed on each slip at all stations, as is the
   case in the Vienna photographs. For the comparison of magnetic dis-
   turbances it is important that the arrangement of lamps, lenses, &c.,
   should be as exactly as possible the same at all stations, for the accuracy
   of the agreement of the results is such that any variation in this arrange-

   ment interferes with the degree of accuracy of the conclusions which may

   be drawn as to the character or the cause of magnetic disturbances.

encouraging, and will be renewed on the first favourable opportunity.

July 21, 1880.  Secretary of the Committee.

      Report on the Caves and Kitchen-viidden at Carrigagower, Co. Cork.

                                      By R. J. UssHEE.

     These caves, whose original mouths are now probably destroyed or

 concealed by rubbish, open at present into a quarry in a limestone knoll

on the townland of Cai-rigagower (' Rock of the Goat '), three or four miles
 south of Middleton. They are not broad nor lofty, but have extensive
 ramifications, especially that one which opens into the north-west part of
the quarry. At its eastern end, and at a depth of 20 feet from the surface,
the quarry is crossed by a cave now exposed by the removal of its western
side. This cave runs in the line of a joint or fissure, and penetrates the
rock north and south. The floor of this cave, where it remains (through

the northern half of the exposed portion), is of stalagmite resting on pale

 sandy clay that overlies the limestone bottom. On this stalagmite floor,
among the debris of broken stalactites, loose charcoal was found, and, on

removing a layer of the solid stalagmite, from 1 inch to 2 inches in thick-

ness, much charcoal was found embedded in it, with sandstone gravel and

some shells of a small Helix, marking the horizon of an old floor that
had been encrusted by the subsequent formation of stalagmite. The
portion of the cave laid open appeared in its southern part to have had no
stalagmite floor, but to have had an upward opening to the sky, through
which an accumulation of brown surface-earth and kitchen waste had
been introduced, extending downwards into the cave so as to have com-
pletely filled this vertical opening. The accumulation was uniform in

character, containing much charcoal, often in large lumps, and a great

profusion of bones and teeth of ox, sheep or goat, and pig, with some
remains of horse, dog, and cat, and a few of hare and rabbit. The bones
were usually broken. Their colour was generally yellowish, but often
blackened, though they exhibited no appearance of dendritis. In some
instances they appeared to have been burned, and charcoal was very fre-
quently found adhering to them and in their interstices. Numbers of
sea-shells occurred through the accumulation. Seven species of these

were noted, the most common being limpet and periwinkle. Many shells
of the common garden-snail also occurred. With the above were found
several articles of human use. Sharpeniug-stoues of different sizes, flat

circular pebbles, hammer-stones, flint-flakes artificially chipped, a frag-

ment of wheel-made pottery, two iron knives of an antique form, an iron
chisel, and a large flat-headed iron nail, some slag and a piece of jet (?).

A portion of a jet bracelet had previously been found in the same brown

surface-earth close to this spot. J. J. Smyth, Esq., to whose kind assist-

ance we are much indebted, found in a recess, close to the above spot,
a portion of the upper stone of a quern embedded in earth. Near the

centre of the quarry, a portion of a cave remains that has been partly
quarried away. In this was discovered, with bones of deer and ox, part
of another stone, very similar to the above portion of a quern, with a flat
surface and a circular hole in it, though not in a direction exactly perpen-
dicular to the surface. In the surface of an adjoining field a deeply
indented arrowhead of flint was found some time since, and labourers
     ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE CAVES OF THE SOUTH OF IRELAND. 211

employed on the spot say that triangular chipped flints have frequently
been met with there. The surface-earth around the quarry contains

many bones of ox, goat, and pig, showing that the spot had been the site
of some human habitation for a considerable lapse of time.

     Further explorations in this cavern have been postponed, but will be
resumed presently.

  Extract from a Report by Kobeet Dat, Esq., F.8.A., on the Implements
                                 found at Oarrigagower, Co. GorJc.

     The iron objects are peculiarly interesting, as examples of very early
domestic articles--comprising a chisel and two knives. The larger of
these has a portion of the Avooden haft still adhering to it, and the turn-
up on the handle part, designed for securing it effectually, occurs on a

larger knife in my collection which was found at Larne, Co. Antrim.

These objects lack the peculiar blue or cobalt patina that is so frequently
found on iron tools from Irish craunogs. The oblong stone with polished
sides is a burnisher or whetstone, upon which probably the knives were

once sharpened. The broken stone may either have been a hone stone or

a chisel-shaped celt. If it was found in the same deposit as the iron
objects, I should say it was another polisher, as it is not probable that a
chisel of the advanced iron type would be found in conjunction with one

of stone. Two of the natural pebbles are hammer-stones, and the third,

with its ground and partly jjolished face, is one of a type commonly met
with in the North of Ireland. In this the central depression is barely
defined, but in others it is much more fully developed, so that I have long
come to the conclusion that, while serving some purpose (perhaps for
grinding the broken points of arrowheads), they were made to pay a
double debt, and served as amulets ! I noticed upon the broken bit of

pottery what looks very like a worn-out inscription in Roman capital
letters. This is best seen with a pocket lens. The bit of jet (?) may be
jet or coal ; I am not competent to give an opinion. The fragments of
flint are all artificial. Among them is the base (showing the bulb of per-
cussion) of a worked flake. These flint-flakes were used down into the
iron age, and we have here another proof of the fact. The bone scoop
sent by Mr. Smyth is, from the character of the texture or structure of

the bone, altered by exposure and time, as it is unquestionably older than
the apple-scoops which schoolboys made in the present century,
and which it closely resembles. I have another like it, from
the Lough Revel Crannog, Co. Antrim, with cobalt patina.
 This from Rathcoursey (Carrigagower) is ornamented, and the
flint arrowhead found there is small, beautifully chipped, and of
the scarce and deeply indented type.

      The iron nail is very curious, with a head like a horse nail.

Report of the Committee, consisting of ]\Ir. Sclater, Dr. Gr.

   Hartlaub, Sir Joseph Hooker, Captain F. M. Hunter, and

    Lieut.-Col. H. H. GtOdwin-Austen, appointed to take steps for the
    Invest!jation of the Natural History of Socotra.

Colonel Godwin- Austen having been unable to carry out his intention of
going to Soootra, the Committee were fortmiate enough to obtain the
services of Dr. I. B. Balfour, Professor of Botany in the University of
Glasgow, for this purpose. Prof. Balfour left this country on January 9,
for Aden, and returned home on April 21. As his report of proceeding?,
&c. (appended), will show, he has, considering the short time (only six
weeks) that could be devoted to the investigation of the island, and the
inevitable delays and difficulties always attending the first exploration of

an unknown country, not only achieved a remarkable amount of success,
but has proved how much more rich the island is than was anticipated,
and how much is left for future explorers.

     The total expenditure of Prof. Balfour on his expedition amounted to
about 420Z. The Committee having received 100/. from this Association,
and 300?. from the Government Grant Fund of the Royal Society, there
remains a debt of about 20Z. due to Prof. Balfour.

    The Committee request that a grant of 50Z. may be made to them to
enable them to discharge this debt. The balance they propose to devote

in aid of the publication of the results obtained by the expedition.
     The Committee consider that the best thanks of the Association are

due to Prof. Balfour for having undertaken this expedition, and for the
zeal and industry with which he has carried it through.

     The Committee consider that the best thanks of the Association are
also due to Brigadier- General Loch, C.B., Resident at Aden, Major Good-
fellow, Assistant Political Agent, and Captain Heron, of H.M.S. Seagull,
for the great assistance they have rendered to Prof. Balfour on this occa-
Bion. The success of the expedition is, as Prof. Balfour informs us,
mainly due to the cordial co-operation of these gentlemen.

     Referring to the report of Prof. Balfour, the Committee feel no doubt
that in every branch of science considerable results are yet to be obtained
by further investigations in Socotra, and are of opinion that a second
expedition should be sent out as soon as the necessary facilities can be

obtained.

Report to the Socotra Committee of the British Association for the Advance-
    ment of Science of the proceedings of the Expedition to the Island of

   Socotra. By Batley Balfour, Sc.D., M.B., Regius Professor of Botany,

     University of Olasgoio, in charge of the Expedition.

     Having undertaken at the request of the Committee the work of an

expedition to the Island of Socotra, for the purpose of investigating its
Natural History, I left England on January 9, and joining the French

mail steamer Ava at Marseilles, reached Aden on the 24th of that month.
I was accompanied by Alexander Scott, a gardener from the Royal

Botanic Garden, Edinburgh.

    On arrival at Aden, 1 met my friend Dr. Hay, the Port Surgeon, to
    ON THE INVESTIGATION OJ? THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SOCOTRA. 213

whose kindness I am much indebted, and with his aid I was enabled to

make a fair collection of the plants of Aden. Captain F. M. Hunter,
Junior Assistant Political Resident, a member of your Committee, was not
at Aden at this time, having gone to the interior a few days previously,
and as he had no prospect of returning to Aden before the expedition left
for Socotra, he had left for me a letter of instruction, giving valuable

information and bintg, the outcome of his personal experiences on the

island. In his absence Major Goodfellow, Senior Assistant Political

Resident, gave me evexy assistance, and the attainment of the object of

the expedition is in great pai't due to him.

     The official letters of recommendation to the authorities at Aden from

the Home Government, for which the Committee applied, had not reached

Aden at the date of our arrival, but having a private letter of introduc-

tion from General Strachey to Brigadier- General Locb, C.B., Political

Resident, I presented it. General Loch very cordially sympathised with
the object of the expedition, and promoted most materially the carrying
out of the work of the expedition. In defaiilt of instructions from the

Home Government he telegraphed to the Bombay Council asking for

authority to aid the expedition, and received a very gratifying affirmative

reply. He then at once placed the despatch boat Dagmar, of the Bombay
Marine, at our disposal to convey us to Socotra, and we were enabled
to obtain from the arsenal, tents and camp implements. He also very

kindly granted leave to Lieutenant Cockburn, 6th Royal Regiment, that
he might go with us to Socotra. Lieutenant Cockburn then joined the
expedition, and apart from the advantage and pleasui'e I derived from

having him as a companion, the excellent sketches ' he made will enable
the Committee to judge of how great an acquisition he was to the staff
of the expedition and of the valuable services he rendered.

    The P. & O. mail steamer arriving on January 26, brought the

promised official letters, one from the India Office to the Resident, and
another from the Admiralty to the Senior Naval Officer at Aden. As
a result of the latter letter. Captain Heron, of H.M.S. Seagull, called

upon me on the 27th and offered to take the expedition to Socotra
in his ship. It was subsequently arranged, therefore, that we should go

in the Seagull instead of the Dagmar, and the date of sailing was fixed
for February 2.

     The intervening days were occupied in obtaining stores and servants
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the latter not easy to procure, especially a good interpreter, on account
of the very high rate of pay demanded.

     All our gear was shipped on the Seagull by noon on February 2, and

-- --our party composed of Europeans, Lieutenant Cockburn, Alexander
--Scott, and myself; and natives, interpreter, cook, tent Lascar, general

servant, and two coolies-- went on board later. Captain Heron purposed
to sail that day, but the monsoon blowing strongly up the harbour

a start was delayed until next morning. On the morning of the 3rd,
though the wind had not much lulled, anchor was weighed and the
Seagull steamed out of Aden harbour in the teeth of a stiff breeze. By
the afternoon we had made so little way against the wind and current,

and were pitching and rolling so gi-eatly, that Captain Heron determined
to put back and make for Aden again. The expedition at the outset thus
encountered annoying delay, for we remained in Aden Harbour until the
morning of February 6, when again the Seagull left for Socotra. Heavy

214 REPOET-- 1880.

weather kept us back, on this our s.econd attempt, and it was not until

the morning of the 11th that we sighted Socotra.

I desired to land at Hadibu, the chief village of the island, where the

Sultan has his Court ; but as much coal had been expended on the voyage,

and the anchorage at Hadibu being reported unsafe. Captain Heron

deemed it advisable to anchor in Gollonsir Bay, a bay considered the

safest round the island, and at its north-west end.

From the village sheikh we learned that the Sultan was living at his

Wehill residence, some miles from Hadibu.  therefore sent by messengers

the letter of recommendation furnished to us by the Aden Government.

But it was not until February 16 that an answer an'ived at Gollonsir

an answer of a very satisfactory kind, allowing us to go where we pleased,

and charging the village sheikh and the people of the neighbourhood to

aid us if possible. Whilst waiting for news from the Sultan, our tents,

stores, and baggage were landed from the Seagull, and our first camp was

formed on the slope of a hill N.E. of the Gollonsir village, and we entered

on our work.

The Seagull left on February 16,

Making in the first instance Gollonsir our head-quarters, we explored

the adjacent country to the S. and S.W., until the 25th inst., when we

struck tents, and sending our heavy baggage and stores by sea, started to

Wemarch to Hadibu.  took four days to accomplish it, reaching Hadibu

late on the night of the 28th inst.

Having communicated to the Sultan the fact of our arrival, he came to

Hadibu on March 1, when we had an interview.

Establishing our depot now on the Hadibu plain, about a mile from the

town, we spent the time until the 7th inst. investigating the magnificent

Haggler range of hills shutting in on the south the Hadibu plain.

    On March 8, leaving a tent Lascar in charge of the depot at Hadibu,
we started upon a trip to the eastern end of the island, going eastward

along the northern side and returning westward l)y the southern side of

the island. During this trip we reached Has Mome, the extreme eastern

headland. Camp at Hadibu was again entered on March 18.

As yet we had not seen much of the southern parts of the island, so

on March 22 we left Hadibu on our last excursion. Crossing the Haggler

range we emerged upon the southern shore at Nogad, traversed the coast

line for some distance, and then recrossed the island, so as to come

down upon Kadhab village on the north side. We regained Hadibu on

the 27th.

March 28. The Dagmar arrived this morning, having been sent

Wespecially for us by the Resident.  were not sorry to see her, as our
--camp was now very sickly Scott was down with fever, one coolie had had

sunstroke, and the other servants were all suffering badly from fever.

So much so that for some time previously hardly one of them could work,

and we had been compelled to hire some of the Sultan's men.

Having shipped our collections and gone on board the Dagmar, she left

Socotra on March 30, and after a smooth but tediously slow passage

reached Aden on Ajiril 3.

Here on our return we experienced as much kindness as before.

General and Mrs. Loch extended to me their hospitality at the Residency.

Our collections were overhauled and finally packed for transmission to

Britain by the P. & 0. steamer Deccan, which reached Aden early on

Api'il 10. By this steamer I also took passage, and travelling to Brindisi,

arrived in London on the 21st. Alexander Scott weftt by the Beccan to

Southampton, which brought him to England with the collections earjy

in Maj. Lieutenant Cockbiirn rejoined his regiment at Aden.

Collections of specimens in all branches of Natural History were made.

As may be supposed I devoted particular attention to the Botany of the

island, and there are dried specimen.s of between 500 and 600 species of
Afloweiing plants in the collection, besides some Cryptogams.
                                                                                              certain

misfortune deprived me of a number of living plants, and on this wise ,±r

Having selected the majority of the more delicate living plants I purposed

to bring them with me to London, as thereby they would arrive a fort-

night earlier than by going by Southampton. At Brindisi, however, the

Custom House officer seized the plants and insisted on their being taken

back to the ship, not allowing me even to book them by another steamer

which would have taken them more directly to England. Consequently

the plants had to travel up to Venice and thence back to Suez before they

could be forwarded to Britain. And all this because the Italian Govern-

ment dreads the introduction of the Phylloxera into Italy, forgetful

apparently of the fact that it is already abundant in the country, and

also that it lives only on vines.                     , , ,! , .,;

Specimens of the gums produced on the island and used in commerce

have been brought home. In the zoological collections there are a fe;r

snakes and lizards, some birds, fi-eshwater fish, Mollusca, Crustacea, and

Insecta of various kinds.

    Some of the land Mollusca have, come to this country alive. Two

living civet cats I was bringing for the Zoological Gardens died on the

way home.

     Illustrative of the geology of the island are about 500 specimens of

rocks and minerals from various localities on the island. Igneous, meta-

morphic, and sedimentaiy rocks are all represented.

    I regret that I was unable for some time after my return to turn my

attention to the distribution of the collections for examination. I have
recently, however, done so, and the following gentlemen have kindly con-

....sented to examine certain groups :                                Mr. Sclater and Dr. Hartlaub.

Museum. The remainder will be distributed variously. The publication
of results is a matter for consideration by the Committee.

     In the foregoing report I have confined myself to a narrative of the
proceedings of the expedition. It is as yet too early to speak definitely

of what the total results will be. But I think I may safely say, from what

I have learnt regarding the birds from Mr. Sclater, and regarding the

land shells from Col. Godwin- Austen, as well as from what I know

of the plant collections, that the results promise to be of exceptional in-

terest. What has been done by the expedition is but a fragment of what

there is to be accomplished. In exploring the island, I deemed it better,
considering the short time of our sojourn, rather to attempt to cover as
much ground as possible, with the view of obtaining a representative

collection, than to examine in detail a limited tract of country. By doing
this, much barren land was travelled over, and many rich and fertile

spots were necessarily only superficially looked at. Especially amongst
the hills of the Haggier range are there valleys which would well
repay a careful and extended investigation. The expedition just com-

pleted ought to be considered only preliminary, for I am assured a rich
harvest awaits any collector who may visit the island.

     If at any future time an expedition should be sent to the island, it
would be well if the date of its arrival were timed so that it should have
the last months and the first months of a year upon the island. Our ex-

pedition reached the island too late in the year, so that before we left
the heat was so intense as to prevent our doing so much work
as we desired. Again, the inaccuracy of our knowledge of the geography
of the island is a point to which the attention of future expeditions
should be directed. The chart based on Wellsted's observations is the
only available one, and that is so incomplete and incorrect as to be almost
useless to anyone moving about the island.

    In conclusion, I desire to express my hearty thanks, and those of the

other members of the expedition, to the Committee for their aid. Also to
General Loch, C.B. ; Major Goodfellow; Dr. Hay; Capt. Heron, R.N.,
and ofiScers of H.M.S. Seagull, and to the officers of the despatch-
boat Dagmar, for the very kind way they one and all co-operated to
make the expedition successful.

     to consider and report on the German and other systems of

     teaching the Deaf to speak.

The Committee was appointed to consider this subject in consequence

of the reading of a paper at Sheffield by Dr. David Buxton.

The General Committee, by this appointment, confirmed the resolu-
--tion of the Sectional Committee, and of Dr. Buxton's audience
                                                                  That

it was referred to this Committee to consider tlie best means of promoting
the adoption of this system throughout the country.

     In pursuance of this reference, they have made themselves acquainted
with the most recent pubhcations upon the subject, consultation has been

held with, and valuable information received from, persons of eminence

and known experience in this department of education, and lengthened

visits have been paid to each of the schools, in and near London, where
deaf children are taught upon this system.

     In the paper read at Sheffield, it was pointed out that other countries

--performed their work of this kind better than it had hitherto been done

in this country :

    1. Because they employ the ' German ' system in preference to the
              ' French ' or ' Combined ' method, their pupils being taught by

         ' Speech,' and not by ' Signs.'
2. Because they employ a superior class and a larger number of

Teachers, who, where it is possible, are specially trained for the

              work, not promiscuously engaged in it, as with us.

--To which may, we think, be added further:

3. Because this department of Education is undertaken and super-

vised by the  State  in  other  countries                                            not left, as  here, to the
                                                                                  ;

direction of bodies of men whose chief qualifications for the

office are their annual subscription and their kind-hearted-

ness.

More, probably, than any other person engaged in education, the

teacher of the deaf needs the encouragement which springs from an

intelligent sympathy. The entire field of education is a vast one. The

instruction of children who are deaf is bnt a very limited portion of that
field, into which very few persons thoroughly enter. To those who labour

in it, and those who are brought into connection therewith by family ties,

Wethe close study of this subject has been almost exclusively confined.

may add, also, in passing, that the repelling character of the sign system
is greatly to blame for this. And it has come to pass that those who
have supported the schools and asylums for the ' Deaf aud Dumb ' have

done so, not from any special knowledge or sympathy, but on the general

grounds of philanthropy, charity, or religion ; and those who have ad-

ministered their affairs have done so in utter ignorance of the peculiar

condition and necessities of the class over whom they were the, generally,

self-constituted guardians. The first feeling of surprise that the born-deaf

could be taught at all has sufficed to keep these kindly unintelligent

observers satisfied that something was being done. How inadequate that

--' something ' really was how far below both the necessities and the

possibilities of the case, they knew not, nor cared to know. In recent

years, however, a change has taken place. The attention attracted to the

subject, by papers which have been read, and discussions which have

followed, in our own and kindred societies, the reported observations of

travellers abroad, and articles in the daily and periodical press, have all
gained for it a large amount of interest among men of science, medical

men, the clergy, and the educated classes generally ; and probably the
very first wish of all persons who have to deal with the future of any deaf
child has now come to be the wish to have it educated on the ' German '

system. This advantage has, however, been all but unattainable, since

nearly all the public asylums and schools in the country ai-e conducted

on the ' French ' system. To discover and point out the advantages of a
218 REPORT-- 1880.

better method, and to make those advantages easier of attainment, are,
we believe, the objects we were appointed to promote, and to this purpose
thus understood we have assiduously applied ourselves in our present

enquiry.

     That a large proportion of the deaf children of this country ai'e grow-

ing up without education, we think is undeniable. The blessing of educa-

tion to the individual, and the burden to the community of an uneducated

deaf and dumb population, impart to this questioii an importance which

--cannot be gainsaid. Whenever it is the foolish and in this case culpable
--reluctance to part with the child which keeps it at home in lifelong-

ignorance, we think compulsion is necessary. Thus far as to children

not at school : our verdict is that they ought to be sent there, and that it

is the nation's duty to send them. Of those who are at school the nation
should further see that the best is made of the opportunity (1) by those
who go to learn, and (2) by those who claim to teach.

    1. To those who learn, sufficient time should be given. They should

       not be kept waiting for admission on the chances of election by

       the votes of the subscribers; nor should they be prematurely

         taken from school through failure of funds for paying the fees,
        or the eagerness of parents to get them employed.

2. Those who teach should be furnished with the best advantages in
       the way of training, remuneration, and status and they should

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

cannot be seriously entertained. What is not good enough for those

easy to realise. It will assimilate the deaf, as far as possible, to the

intellectual and social condition of those who hear, and will bi'eak down
those restraints which confine them amongst themselves, and make them
more and more ' deaf and dumb,' thus confirming and strengthening that

 Report of the Coonmittee, consisting of Mr. James Heywood, Mr.

   Shaen, Mr. Stephen Bourne, Mr. Wilkinson, the Eev. W.
    Delany, and Dr. J. H. Gladstone (^Secretary), appointed for
    the pjiirpose of reporting whether it is important that H.M.

    Inspectors of Elementary Schools shoidd be appointed with
    reference to their ability for examining in the scientific spjecific
    subjects of the Code in addition to other matters.

The Committee nominated at Sheffield for the purpose of considering
' whether it is important that H.M. Inspectors of Elementary Schools

should be appointed with reference to their ability for examining in the
scientific specific subjects of the Code in addition to other matters,' have
received a considerable amount of evidence upon the subject, and beg to

I'eport as follows :

      1. It has come to their knowledge that the teaching of the scientific

specific subjects is practically discouraged by the incapacity of many of
H.M. Inspectors to examine in them.

      2. This incapacity is explained by the fact that the Inspectors are not

generally chosen so much for their fitness to judge of such educational

work, as on account of their high, scholarship, or through political
patronage.

      3. In the opinion of this Committee there might be an examining body
for H.M. Inspectors, composed of three of the most experienced of the
present senior Inspectors, associated with a similar number of the Science
Examiners of the Science and Art Department. The examination should
be thrown open to Elementary Teachers, and the candidates might be
tested in the practical work of examination in one of the Central Elemen-
tary Schools in London.

     4. The Committee believe that the opening of the Inspectorship to
fully qualified Elementary Teachers would tend to raise the esprit de corps
of the profession, and improve the character of both Inspector and

Teacher.

     5. The Committee are further of opinion that while a university
degree may be fitly regarded as a test of scholarship, it is not a test of
the particular qualifications for an examiner, and therefore is not suffi-
cient in itself to guarantee the holder thereof as worthy the position of

Inspector. There appears to be no I'eason why academical honours should
be made an indispensable condition of appointment.

     6. The Committee recommend that a Memorial be presented to the
Lords of the Committee of Privy Council on Education embodying the

above conclusions.

On the Anthracite Goal and Goal-field of South Walef>.
                         By C. H. Perkins.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in. c.rtensa
                                          among the Reports.]

The anthracite or 'stone coal' deposit of the British Islands is confined,

with shght exception, to a small portion of the South Wales coal-field.

But, limited as it is, it possesses features of an unusually interesting and

attractive nature, both in respect to its geological character and the pe-

culiar quality of the coal itself. In considering this subject it will be

desirable to bear in mind some of the leading features of the coal-field

alluded to, of which, as stated, the anthracite deposit forms a part.

The South Wales coal-field has its eastern boundaiy near the centre

of Monmouthshire, and extends from at or near Pontypool in that county,

in a westerly direction, until lost in the waves of the Atlantic Ocean, or,
more correctly speaking, the Irish Channel, in St. Bride's Bay in Pem-

brokeshire. It thus traverses a distance of over 90 miles. To this consider-

able length its breadth forms a proportion by no means commensurate, as

Weit nowhere exceeds 21 miles.  are now standing within two or three

miles of the southern outcrop of the coal basin, and a crow's flight north-

wards of 15 or 16 miles will bring us to the north outcrop in Carmai'-
thenshire. The sides and bottom of this great geological valley are

composed of mountain limestone, within whicli are piled up the various

carboniferous strata to a maximum depth in the centre of over 3000

yards.

This valley or basin is marked by two distinct troughs. The south,

the smaller one of the two, extends from the Sirhowy valley on the east

to the neighbourhood of Aberavon on the west ; while the larger or north
trough reaches from Llanelly through Morriston, Neath, and Blackwood,

to Pontypool on the east. The south trougli passes out of the coal mea-

sures near Swansea, leaving to the west but one basin, a continuation, in

fact, of the north trough, with which, in respect to anthracite, we have
alone to do. From the centre of this basin, where the measures lie flat
or nearly so, the rise may be regarded for our present purpose as north

and south, though in reality nature has not followed minutely these car-

dinal points. ' Level course ' would thus run in the main east and west,

and, as a rule, the faults cut it in a transverse direction. These faults

are frequently of great magnitude, showing at times a displacement up

to 200 to 300 yards.

The quality of the South Wales coal ranges from the pure anthi'acite

or ' stone coal ' to the semi-anthracite or Welsh steam coal, and onwards
to the highly bituminous or smith's and gas coal. There is also a con-
siderable quantity of coal commonly known as ' bastard anthracite,' the

quality of which is   extremely inferior for                                                                                              while  debarred of the  purity
                                                                                                                                       ;

and strength of anthracite, it does not possess the opening or swelling

faculty of the steam coal, and decrepitates when burning to an unusual

degree. Anthracite or ' stone coal,' with the exception of the Pembroke-

shire portion of the coal-field, is found exclusively on the north rise. I
use the term ' stone coal ' advisedly, for that of anthracite has, with more

or less correctness, been applied to coals which, while bearing an affinity

to it, are yet far removed from this, the diamond of the British coal-field,
    ON THE ANTHRACITB COAL AND COAL-FIELD OF SODTII WALES. 221

SO beautiful in appearance, so pure and powerful in combustion, and so

cleanly in its nature. The deposit may be said to commence on the east,
at the higher points of the Neath valley. At Kidwelly, on the west, it

is submerged under the waters of Carmarthen Bay, again to reappear at

Saundersfoot in Pembrokeshire, and finally to be lost in St. Bride's Bay.

Its limitation to the north rise renders the width of the deposit extremely

narrow, the more so as stone coal jealously refuses to mingle with its less

carboniferous kindred, and a barrier of intermediate quality intervenes as

a rule between it and                             the bituminous seams of       the south rise                                                                                                   but  to the
                                                                                                                                                          ;

north the mountain limestone and its associated strata alone check the

operations of the stone coal worker. The gradual transition in their
quality, which the same scenes present, renders a definition of the anthra-

cite boundaries extremely diflicult. Speaking roughly, I estimate the

length of the deposit, exclusive of Pembrokeshire, at DO miles, with an
average breadth of 6 miles. Upon this supposition we should have an

area of 180 square miles or 115,200 acres. In addition to this the por-

tion beneath the sea in Carmarthen Bay is 15 miles in length by 6 in

breadth                                      and  the Pembrokeshire coal-field  extends for 20 miles, with an
                                          ;

avei-age width of 5 miles. I have not considered it necessary within

the limits of this paper to enter into any minute calculation regarding

the quantity of workable coal now existing in the leading portion of the

deposit. I allude to that lying eastwards of Carmarthen Bay ; but I
believe we shall be within the mark in estimating an average thickness to

exist of 35 feet of workable coal, affording a yield of some 35,000 tons to

the acre. An allowance must, of course, be made for the workings that have

already occurred; but they can have made but an insignificant inroad

into the enormous mass of magnificent fuel which here lies for the benefit
of mankind and the exercise of science and art, in the provision of the

best means for its utilisation. The coal-field may be divided thus :

          1st. The Pembrokeshire district.

    2nd. The Gwendraeth Valley district.
    3rd. From thence eastwards to the Vale of Neath in Glamor-

                                                  ganshire.

    I have already stated the area of the first, which, according to the

report made to the Royal Coal Commission, contains over two hundred

and fifteen millions of tons of workable coal, all anthracite. The ground

is  here                                     much disturbed, and  the  seams, as a rule, thin                                                                                               but  the quality
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

of the coal, more especially the ' Kilgetty ' and 'Timber' veins, is pro-

bably the finest in the world. Mr. Thomas Foster Brown, in his interest-

ing paper upon the South Wales coal-field, gives a list of seven workable

seams, containing an aggregate thickness of 17 feet 9 inches, and lyino°-
within a depth of 980 feet.

     The Gwendraeth Valley, in Carmarthenshire, is rich in both coal and
iron ore. At its upper end the quality is highly anthracitic, modified to
some extent as we approach the sea at Barry Port or Pembrey. There
are some twenty-two seams of coal, varying from one to nine feet in

thickness, that crop out in this valley, with a collective thickness of over

60 feet. I am quite unable, within the limits of this paper, to enter into

any detail of the mineral features of this and the adjoining district,

reaching, as before stated, to the Vale of Neath. I must confine myself
to simply pointing out the abundance of its resources. The seams of

coal are numerous, and range even up to 18 feet in thickness, all pro-
ducing anthracite, but, as usual, varying to some extent in quality. The
--222 REPORT 1880.

' Big Vein ' of the Aman Valley, known as the ' Stanlljd ' of the Gwen-
draeth and Mynydd Maur districts, has the highest reputation for purity

and strength. This seam must not be confounded with the ' Nine-foot
vein, to which the appellation of ' Big Vein ' is sometimes applied, both

in the Gwendraeth Valley and at Mynydd Maur.
     Another well-known seam is the ' Brass ' vein, known also as the

' Peacock ' and the ' Diamond ' vein, which attains its best condition in
the Swansea Valley, and is greatly esteemed for the various purposes to
which anthracite is applied. Many of the other seams are also deserving

of special notice ; but having given such a description of the coal-field as

may lead us, to some extent, to realise its value in respect to its resources

and productive power, it will be desirable to consider the difference,
chemical and otherwise, that distinguishes pure anthracite from semi-

anthracite and bituminous coals ; and here we are necessarily met with

the same difficulty as in attempting to define the boundaries of the coal
basin, and from the same cause, that of the gradual and almost imper-
ceptible merging into each other of the coals referred to. Professor
Dawkins says : ' The whole difference between anthracite coal and ordi-
nary coal consists in this, that the bituminous portion of the anthracite
has been removed in some way ; while in the case of ordinary coal, the
hydrogen and oxygen of the bituminous part still remains.' But this
definition still leaves us to determine where anthracite ends and bitu-

minous begins ; and, in considering this portion of my subject, I have
felt myself compelled to fall back upon the analysis I have before me of

a few of the coals worked in the South Wales basin, which are recog-
 nised as examples of the various descriptions referred to.

     Passing from these several examples of pui'e anthracitte, I have selected

From these details it will appear that in the chief constituent, carbon,

the purest anthracite exceeds the ' bastard ' anthracite by 5 per cent., the

best Welsh steam coal by 3-91, and the bituminous coal by 21-45 per cent.

But, on the whole, and regarded simply in a practical light, I consider

these  returns  singularly unsatisfactory                                                                                                                                                         I may almost         add, deceptive.  I
                                                                                                                                                     ;

allude particularly to the analysis of the ' bastard anthracite ' and that of
the Welsh steam coal. In the examples I have given there is but a
difference of 1-9 in. carbon, '8 of hydrogen, and "28 in oxygen and nitrogen.

And yet practically, and for all marketable purposes, no greater diver-

gence can exist.

     I must leave it to the chemist or others to explain this difficulty,
one which also to some extent exists in respect to the Welsh and

American anthracites. Judging from analysis, appearance, and general

characteristics, these fuels are connected by the closest ties ; and ^-et,
while our Welsh coal, with all its splendid attributes, is neglected and,

excepting for a few purposes, shunned and despised, its great American

brother enters into wide and general use. Much of this is due, no doubt,

to habit, custom, and necessity                                                                                                                                                                   and I also  believe  that  the  rendering of
                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the coal for market in pieces of various and suitable size, as adopted in

America, is a very great convenience, and would, if followed in this

Wecountry, greatly increase the trade of the anthracite worker.                                                                                                                                                                   should,

however, look deeper into the matter for a solution of the problem. Dr.

Percy indeed saj^s with respect to anthracite coal, 'The property of

decrepitating may cause the production of fine particles to such an extent
224 REPOBT-- 1880.

as seriously to check the passage of air through a furnace in which

anthracite is used for fuel, even when the air is impelled by a blast engine.
It is a property belonging to Welsh anthracite, and to some varieties of it

to an extraordinaiy degree, but not, I am informed, to the anthracite of
the United States of America.' However this may be, we know that

anthracite does not possess the opening or swelling qualities of the Welsh
 steam coal, nor the binding or caking properties of the bituniinons coal.

And thus we have occasion for the introduction of appliances for securing

perfect and more rapid combustion ; to which, in alluding to the history
of anthracite, in respect of the various purposes to which it is applied, or
sought to be applied, I shall venture to direct your attention.

     This history is replete with the recoi'ds of attempts made to extend
the use of this fuel. Imbued with the knowledge of its inherent strength,
its purity and admitted advantages, persons have come forward through

--a series of years some actuated by personal interest, combined with a

desire to promote the public good, others through the latter incentive
alone, and have spent money, time, thought, and labour upon this object,

but unfortunately with but little success.

     To this day, the use of anthracite in this country is practically
confined to malting, hop-drying, and lime-burning, and consequently the

resources of this fine coal-field remain practically iindeveloped.

     As early as the year 1-595 attention seems to have been drawn to the

valuable qualities of anthracite coal. Writing in that year a history of
Pembrokeshire, George Owen, Esq., of Henllys, says, after speaking of
certain woods that had existed in times past, but were then destroyed :

' But, for the most part, those that dwell neere the cole, or that may have

it carried by water with ease, use most cole fii-es in their kitchings, and
some in their halles, because it is a ready fiere, and very good and sweete
to rost and boyle meate, and voyde of smoake where yet chymnies are.'
It is, he adds, ' called stone cole for the hardness thereof,' ' and being once
kindled giveth a greater heat than light, and delighteth to burn in darke
places.' ' Is not noysome for the smoake nor nothing soe lothsome for the
smell as the ring cole is, whose smoake annoyeth all things neare it, as

fyne linen, men's handes that warm themselves by it ; but this stone cole

yieldeth in a manner noe smoake after it is kindled, and is soe pure that
fine camerick and laune is usually dried by it without any stayne or

--blemish, and is a most proved good dryer of malt therein passing wood,

feme, or strawe. This cole for the rare properties thereof was carried out
of this country to the citie of London, to the late Lord Tresurer Burley,

by a gentleman of experience, to shewe how farr the same excelled that
of Neucastell wherewith the citie of London is servid, and I think if the
passage were not soe tedious there would be greate use made of it.' Such

is the tribute to the excellent quality of stone coal afforded by this inte-

resting old geologist. Two hundred and fifty years later, Taylor, in his

' Statistics of Coal,' writes of Welsh anthracite, after alluding to the
slight use made of it : ' Yet, if we mistake not greatly, the day will arrive
when this great metropolis (London) will seek from the mountains of
Wales her supplies of a mineral fael far preferable to that which from
custom she now considers so valuable, and which, from its imperfect
combustion, among other cau.ses, now darkens the air with smoke, and
pervades a vast and densely inhabited area with its sooty and noxious

--particles.' This prophecy is still unfulfilled but in the presence of fogs

hanging with increasing frequency like a funereal pall over the city

raising the rates of mortality to an alarming extent, depressing the spirits

and injuring the property of its inhabitants, it may well become a subject

for earnest consideration whether some great alteration is not needed in

our domestic heating arrangements, in cases where a population so vast

and unprecedented is brought together. Our English prejudices fill us

with the belief that comfort is alone to be found in an open grate and a

blazing fire, around which we crowd in order to obtain some portion of

the heat which finds its natural vent up the chimney ; but is not this

really prejudice or the result of habit ? and would not the Canadian stoves,

so much extolled by Mr. Hussey Vivian in his notes on his American

tour, used with anthracite coal, afford a far more desirable and equable

heat, and at the same time relieve the atmosphere from the masses of

smoke now poured forth during the greater part of the year from every

chimney in London, and render it as pure and clear as that which per-

vades the great anthracite-consuming city of Philadelphia ?

     Canadian or other stoves are moreover not essential for the use of

stone coal for domestic purposes. An ordinary grate, with brick sides

and back, close bars and a fair draught, will afford as clear and cheerful a

fire as can be desired.

    From its maritime position, Pembrokeshire was enabled to take the

lead in the supplies of this fuel. An outlet for the workings in the

remaining and far larger portion of the coal-field (excepting such as mules

and ponies could afl'ord) was only provided through the formation of

canals and railways.

  --Their construction has been as follows : The Swansea Canal, from

Swansea to Abercrave, made in 1796, now supplemented by the Swansea

Vale Railway, worked by the Midland Railway Company; the Neath

Canal, made in or about the year 1800, up the Neath Valley, from Swan-

sea and Britonferry, the use of which is now in a great degree superseded

by the Great Western Railway, with which is connected the Neath and

Brecon line passing through Crynant and Onllyn ; the Gwendraeth

Valley Canal, now converted into a railway, formed in 1825 from the port

of Pembrey to Pontyberem; and the Llanelly Railway, now owned by

the Great Western Railway Company, from Llanelly to Cwmaman and

Llandilo, constructed in 1840. These several arteries, with a line about

to be made to Mynydd Maur, in Carmarthenshire, form a complete outlet

for the entire basin, and a ready means of communication with the ports

of Swansea, Neath, Llanelly, and Pembrey, and with all parts of the

kingdom, and their formation marks the epochs when anthracite was

enabled to enter the general markets.

The first attempt in this country, so far as I am aware, to use stone

coal for steam navigation, was on board a little boat called the Anlhrao'fe,

running on the Thames about the year 1835, but I have no records by

me of the course or results of that experiment. In 1847 some 600 tons

was supplied to the steam-ship Washington, belonging to the American

line running from Southampton to New York. In this case a fan was

used, and, under the influence of the magnificent fires afforded by stone

coal so treated, she proceeded on her voyage with the best prospects of

success ; but within a few hours she was back at Southampton with her

furnace bars utterly destroyed by the great heat. Recognising the neces-

sity of employing artificial draught, and that under such circumstances

some method was needed for the protection of the bars, Messrs. Kymer

and Kirk, the proprietors of an anthi'acite colliery, took out a patent in

1880.                    Q
226 REPORT-- 1880.

1847 for a water grate to efiFect the object in view, but after a series of
experiments it was not found practically to do so.

     In the years 1853-54 Messrs. McLarty and Co. employed anthracite
in their steamers the Livorna and Geneva, trading between Liverpool and
the Mediterranean ports, and apparently with great success. In this
case no artificial draught was used, and they reported thus : ' The an-

--thi'acite has proved to be a twofold saving in regard to economy of space,

and to a very large saving in the consumption. In the former, the average
saving of stowage is 20 per cent., and in the latter, the reduction in con-

sumption is from 40 to 50 per cent., according to the quality of the coal.

     ' Its great cleanliness and entire freedom from smoke we look upon as
not the least of the benefits its use confers upon us.'

     The general business of this firm was not, I believe, profitable, and

consequently this successful exposition of the use of anthracite ceased to

exist. Prior to this period Dr. Frankland had reported to Mr. Watney

the result of his experiments with the ' Pump Quart ' vein coal of the
Gwendraeth Valley. He states ' that the coal possessed an evaporating

power considerably greater than any other fuel yet examined, 1 lb. eva-
porating, under favourable circumstances, in this boiler, 12'43 lbs. of

water.' He adds that the space occupied by a ton of this anthracite, as

used for fuel, is less than that taken up by any other coal, and he fur-
nishes a table showing the number of lbs. of water evaporated by 1 cubic
foot of various coals as under :

     Anthracite was also introduced and for some time used on board her

Majesty's yachts Fairy and the Victoria and Albert.
     The ' Times' of July 7, 1853, under the head of naval intelligence, and

referring to the sailing of the Victoria and Alhert, from Holyhead to
Dublin, contains the following paragraph : ' Her Majesty and the Court,

as well as the oflBcers of the yacht, will have a more comfortable voyage
this ti-ip than hitherto, owing to the use of the anthracite fuel with

Colonel Coffin's steam jets fitted to her furnaces, by which no smoke or
ashes issue from the funnel, thus abolishing the nuisances of smuts in the
eyes and on the clothes of all on deck, and covering the decks with the
dust from the flues, which the ordinary coal throws upon them.' The

 Great Britain steamship, the Boyal Charter, the Faith and other vessels

were also at this time using anthracite with much success ; but these
vessels, I am informed by Mr. Vickerman, of Hean Castle, Pembrokeshire
 (alluding to the two first), ' passed into other hands, who were interested
in steam coal colleries.' He adds, ' The royal yacht also used anthracite

 from these collieries in her Majesty's yachting days, and she was so
 charmed with the cleanliness that she forbade the use of any other fuel
 when herself aboai'd.' In no single case, however, has the use of this
 fuel continued, and the opinion long since entertained and expressed,
 that without artificial draught it will not be a permanent success, has
 been fully confirmed. Economy in consumption, saving in space, and
 other advantages are no doubt readily obtained, but not so rapidity in
 evaporation ; and, further, it has been demonstrated that the fierce fire

and extraordinary heat evolved by stone coal under the influence of arti-
ficial draught, requires some means for the protection of the bars. I also
venture to think that, as described by Dr. Percy in the extract from his
work which I have already given, the property of decrepitation may, as
he says, so seriously check the passage of air through a furnace that the
desirability of conveying the draught by means of the bars themselves, to

all parts of the fire, is very apparent.

     With the view of meeting the several difficulties I have endeavoured

to describe, Mr. R. W. Perkins (than whom no better authority upon

matters connected with anthracite exists), in connection with Mr. F. H.
Perkins and Mr. Joseph Williams, took out a patent in November 1876,
entitled ' Improvements in and relating to furnaces for burning anthra-
cite and other fuel,' the main features of which consisted in the employ-
ment of hollow perforated bars, through which the blast is forced by a fan,

steam-jet, or other artificial means. In this way combustion is enormously
accelerated, and at the same time the bars are kejDt perfectly cool by the

current of cold air passing through them. I have myself seen a piece of

paper inserted within a bar when the fire was at its hottest, and remain-
ing unsinged for a very considerable time. With this appliance Mr,

Perkins instituted a series of trials at the foundry of Mr. T. W. Williams,

Evaporated 6'59 lbs. water to 1 lb. of coal, and 1200 lbs. water per

      hour.

     In the foregoing trials the pressure of steam was maintained at 40
to 45 lbs.

    I may here mention that Perkins's furnace, with Korting's No. 1

blower, has been in use for the past two years under the boilers at the
stationary engine belonging to the Metropolitan District Railway, and

situated on the Thames Embankment at the Temple Station, close to the

statue of the late Mr. Brunei, where it can be seen ; and it has removed
much inconvenience that they there experienced from great deficiency of
draught, which I have no doubt Mr. Speck, the manager of the railway,

will confirm. In February 1878 a patent was taken out by Mr. T. W.

Williams, whose name I have already mentioned, the object of which is
to apply a blower of a cheaper construction than Korting's, and to avoid
the noise created by the latter. This he effects by the application of a

steam-jet inserted into every alternate bar through a nozzle of about yV^^

of an inch diameter. The furnaces thus constructed have given much

satisfaction, both in the use of anthracite as well as other coal, effecting

much economy in the cost of fuel, and they are in use in a large number of

the most important works in this neighbourhood and elsewhere. These
patents have been followed by one taken out by Mr. J. E. Elannery, in
September 1878, for effecting still further improvements, having the
same objects in view.

     First. The conduction of the blast so that it may enter the bars where

         necessary from their length, or for its better application, or other-

           wise, at both ends.

     Second. When a steam-jet blower is used, in lieu of inserting a jet

          into each bar, as in Williams' patent, he forms a blower in connec-

        tion with each pair of bars. This lessens by half the number of
        nozzles, and is intended to make the blast more effectual, and at the
         same time to decrease the consumption of steam.

     Third. By a hole in the bar at the end furthest from the entry of the

         blast, he expels any ash or refuse that might enter through the
         perforations, by means of the blast itself.
     But for marine steam boilers there are objections to the use of steam
blowers, the chief being the quantity of steam they require, and the waste
of fresh water in the boilers, and consequently a fan or other blast is
desirable. In reference to the application of anthracite to marine
engines, a series of experiments was made last year on board the steam-

ship Elephant, belonging to Messrs. Penn & Son. Into the fall details

time -will not permit me to enter--they are given in a paper read by Mr.

Flannery before the Society of Naval Architects, and fully reported in

' Engineering,' on April 16, 1880. I may say, however, that they fully
confirm the trials made at Swansea. Mr.' Flannery concluded his paper

in the following words : ' It would be superfluous to say that this coal,
anthracite, should have very general adoption in Her Majesty's N"avy, and
on board yachts, on account of its cleanliness, economy, non-explosive
character, absolute smokelessness and strength under transportation,

along with the absence of deterioration in the tropics.'
     For stationary engines, where there is ample gi-ate-surface, and great

rapidity of evaporation is not needed, stone coal requires but a good natural

draught and proper stoking.
      I need hardly say that it is used for the engines at all the anthracite

collieries, and for thirty years by Messrs. Hall & Son, at their powder

mills at Faversham. These gentlemen have been good enough to reply

to inquiries I made of them in view of this paper, as follows :

    We' took to anthracite primarily on account of the absence of smoke

and sparks, and it always satisfies us in this respect.

    ' Fo alteration in our furnaces was needed. Forty pounds of steam is

our average, although some of our boilers work up to fifty pounds.

    We' use no artificial draught. The distance between the fire-bars is,

in the larger furnaces one inch, and in the smaller fths ; and we do not
notice that they burn out faster. If the nominal price of North Country

%and Welsh coal is the same, we should say the latter is 25 the cheaper

of the two.'

    Messrs. Pigou & Wilks have also used the same fuel at their Dartford
powder mills, for the past five or six years, and I am favoured with

information of a similar nature to the foregoing, in respect of their expe-

rience of it.

     I had intended alluding to the use of anthracite in the manufacture of

iron ; but I fear my paper has already exceeded the limits to which I am

entitled, and the subject is too large and interesting to be dismissed in a
few brief sentences. I can but hope that I have said enough generally
with respect to this fuel, to show the great desirability of increased
attention being paid to it. Quoting the words of Mv. Hiissey Vivian

We' possess the finest anthracite in the world, and it lies almost

untouched.'

     Its advantages as a steam-raising fuel are undeniable, and not less so

are those it presents for domestic and general purposes, where, as in
London and other great cities, the absence of smoke would so greatly
minister to the health and happiness of the inhabitants. I believe there
is here a field worthy of the attention of scientific men, whose duty and

privilege it is to render the products of the earth available for the benefit

of mankind.

Report on the Present State of our Knowledge of the Crustacea.

                   By C. Spexce Bate, F.R.S , c&c.

  --Part V. Ox Feccxdatiox, Eespiratiox, and the Green Gland.

 Copulation of the crayfish takes place, according to the observatious of

 M. Chantran,' during a period which includes the months of November,
 December, and Jannary. The male seizes the female with his large
 nippers, turns her over, and whilst he holds her lying on her back, places
 himself in such a manner as to pour out the fecundating material upon
 the two outer lamelliB of the tail. After this first operation, which lasts
 some minutes, he conveys her rapidly beneath his pleon, in order to effect
 a second deposition of semen upon the plastron round the external open-
 ing of the oviducts, by means of the curious mechanism so accurately
 described by M. Coste, upon the plates of the caudal fan (Bipisura).^

      According to the degree of the maturity of the ova at the time of the
 union of the sexes, oviposition takes place at a period varying from ten

to foi'ty-five days after copulation. At the moment when this function
is about to be performed, the female raises herself upon her feet, and her
pleopoda secrete for several hours a very viscous greyish mucus ; and
then she lies upon her back and brings up her tail upon her plastron in
such a manner as to form with her pleon a chamber, as has also been ob-

served by Lereboullet, in which the ova are collected, enclosing the aper-
ture of the oviducts, the wall of which secretes a viscous fluid intended to

fasten the eggs to the pleopoda during incubation. When things are in

this state, the laying of the eggs takes place. It is efiected at once,
usually during the night, rarely during the day. ' In different females

this expulsion lasts from one to two hours. The ova, which are always

turned so as to present their whitish spot or cicatricula above, as if to

receive more easily the influence of fecundation, are thus immersed in the
greyish mucus, which in a manner binds the pleopoda and the margins
and extremity of the telson to the pereion, and which assists in bounding
the pouch or chamber so formed, in which a certain quantity of water is

enclosed with the ova and mucus. Immediately after the oviposition we
may detect in this mucus and water the presence of spermatozoids, pre-

cisely similar to those which are contained in the spermatophores attached

to the plastron, and derived from them. With them are mixed pale yellowish
drops and a certaia number of rounded gi^anulated globules, isolated or

united in little masses, which do not exist in the cavity of the spermato-

phores, when spermatozoids are to be found. These spermatozoids are
thus in direct contact with the ova, and in the midst of the vehicle which

--facilitates their penetration. Fecundation, then, is accomplished in this

chamber that is to say, outside of the genital organs of the female.'
     The observations of M. Chantran have been corroborated by M. C.

Robin, who has ' seen that the spermatozoids, which are found in contact

with the ova in the chamber I have just described, are similar to those

seen in the genital organs of the males, and to those in the spermatophores

attached to tlie pereion. They are in the form of flattened cells, with five
to seven rigid immovable cilia starting from their contour, and with a
barrel-shaped projection about their middle. During the first two days
following the oviposition, these spermatozoids, which are very abundant
around the ova and in the mucus, become spherical and pale and remain
motionless ; in the following days they wither, and also become smaller,
darker, and irregular. Lastly, when, after the fixation of the ova, the
excess of the mucus has completely disappeared, in consequence of the
pressure exerted by the incessant contractions of the pleon (which takes
place in a variable period, of from eight to ten days after the oviposition),
those spermatophores which still remain attached to the plastron, consist

of small, white coriaceous filaments, either isolated or mutually adherent
they no longer show anything but a central cavity, in which the micro-

scope reveals only a few more or less withered spermatozoids. The wall
of these spermatophores retains its thickness, and remains, as before,
composed of a concrete, striated, tenacious mucus.'

     Incubation lasts about six months, and the hatching takes place in
May, June, or July.

     The first moult takes place ten days or thereabouts after exclusion
the second, third, fourth, and fifth moults take place at intervals of from
twenty to twenty-five days, so that the young animal changes its integu-
ment five times within a hundred days, corresponding to the months of
July, August, and September. The sixth, seventh, and eighth moalts
take place in the following May, .June, or July. So that there are eight
moults during the first year of the animal's existence : five in the second
year, and two in the third, of which the first takes place in June, the

second in September. From this time the young crayfish becomes an

adult.

     After this the moulting takes place once a year in females and twice in

males, which M. Chantran considers explains why the latter are larger
than the former, the growth being in proportion to the number of

moults. In the adult males the first moi^lt takes place in June or July,
and the second in August or September. The single moult of the females
occurs in August or September.

     To effect its moult, the animal places itself on its side ; with its head
and back it raises its carapace, which swings like a lid upon its hinge

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

then when it has thus completely disengaged the antei-ior part of the body,
it separates entirely from its old carapace by a sudden movement of the
posterior part. This operation, which lasts about ten minutes, is favoured
by the previous secretion of a gelatinous material between the two cara-
paces, which facilitates their disengagement.

     Twelve hours after the moults the legs of the crayfish are sufficiently
firm to pinch strongly. Twenty- four hours later they are completely
hardened, the dorsal surface remaining longer flexible ; but at the end of
forty-eight hours it has attained nearly a normal degree of consistency.

   The young animal remains attached to the pleopoda of the parent for
ten days after exclusion, when the first moult takes place. This is effected
actually under the tail of the mother, and M. C. Robin has ascertained
by means of the microscope, as shown by M. Chantran to the Academy,
that the young remain suspended beneath the pleon of the mother by
means of a hyaline chitinous filament, which extends frona a point of the

  inner surface of the ovisac to the internal branch of each of the four lobes

  of the median membranous lamina of the caudal appendage. This fila-
 ment exists when the embryos have only attained about three-fourths of

  their development.

       If the young, continues M. Chantran, detach themselves before this

  period, they cannot live separately ; but after the first nioulb they some-
  times quit their mother and return to her again, up to the twentieth day,

 at which period they can live independently. He .'=ays {Gomptes Rendus

 for July 17, 1871) he has observed that the young not only feed,
  while attached to the mother, upon the pellicle of the eggs, and the

  exnvia of the early moults, but the stronger ones cat those individuals
 whose development is rendered difficult by their agglomeration, and
 whicli cannot moult. Those which in moulting break their limbs ai-e also

 devoured by their companions. Thus the crayfish which are ten days
 old eat each other, and this is moreover the case with those of any age
 when they moult and are too numerous for the small space they occupy

 beneath the pleon of the mother.

      M. Chantran also has observed that temperature exerts a marked in-
 fluence upon the duration of incubation and the number of the periodical
 moults between the exclusion of the young from the ovum and the adult
 period. The male becomes ready for copulation on entering its third
 year, and the female for fecundation at the commencement of the fourth
 year. In relation to the reproduction of the lost appendages M. Chan-
 tran's observations require confirmation, which he promised to make

 known. He says that the antennae are reproduced during the period of a

 single moult. The other limbs are reproduced more slowly, three moults

 taking place during their regeneration. In the first year of their existence
 seventy days suffice for the reproduction of these limbs, while in the adult
 crayfish, the female requires three or four years to reproduce its limbs,
 and the male from a year and a half to two years, for the adult male
 moults twice a year and the female only once.

     M. Gerbe, who has given much attention to the development of Crus-

 tacea, says, none of those that he has observed has its organisation complete

 on its quitting the ovum as a hrephalus (or larva), or j^ossesses features iden-

 tical with the parent, so that it might be referred to the species to whicli
 it belongs. All are furnished with transitory appendages adapted for
 natation, whicli give them a locomotion different from that of the adult
 stage. These appendages, he states, remain until the fifth and sixth
moult, and become atrophied in position without falling off. It is not
 until the fifth or sixth moult that the general form of the adult external

organs are complete. The brepJiali of various species, however they may
resemble each other in external form, show minor features of distinction,
such as a variation in the number and form of spots, and especially in
the number and conformation of the plumose hairs and spines which

fringe the extremity of the last segment of the pleon. These, he says,
present definite characters which enable us to say to what species any

particiilar brepbalus belongs.

     The stomach of the Crustacea in the zoasa stage presents, he says, no

solid pieces adapted for the grinding of food. It is furnished on its inner
surface with stiff siJinuIes arranged in rows, and with vibratile cilia like

those found in the stomachs of a great number of the lower animals.
These cilia communicate an incessant movement of rotation to the orgauic
molecules upon which the animals feed.
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                                                               233

     111 the brephalus of Paltemon, whicli we have carefully studied in a
fresh and living state, we liave not been able to detect any vibratile cilia

within the stomach, but have observed that the outer wall has a strong
and persistent power of contracting upon itself, and so forcing the con-

tents of the stomach in a constant motion.
     M. Gerbe (loc. cit.) also states that the liver consists of two simple cteca,

one on each side, ' manifestly a diverticulum of the intestinal tube, with
which it has wide communications ; by ramifying it forms a hollow tree,
at the base of which oscillate the vitelline globules, which the umbihcal

vesicle pours into the pyloric portion of the intestine.'

    He also states that in whatever manner the respiratory functions may

be performed in the adult crustacean, all have a tegumentary respira-
tion in the brephalus condition, whether it be in the zoaja or megalop stage.

    He has observed the brephalus of Eomarus to possess a rudimentary

branchial apparatus quite unfit to perform any functions, while the bre-
phali of other genera are absolutely destitute of such organs, and some do

not obtain them until after several moults.                                                                              the

   mThis want of branchial respiration necessitates a distinction

character of the circulation in the younger, as compared with that of

the adult forms of Crustacea, that is as between those that have none and

those that have matured branchial organs.

     In the brephali of Maia, .Forcellana, Crangon, Palamon, Palinurus,
Eomaru?, Cancer, &c., the blood which the arteries have distributed to the
different parts of the body returns entirely, directly to the heart, and this

condition continues for a considerable time. ' It is,' he says, ' only after
the third moult, in the most perfect brephalus of the species inhabiting our
seas, that of the lobster, that a few globules are diverted from the original

general circulation to penetrate into the nascent branchiae. All the

arteries open directly into the venous passages by an aperture more or

less dilated into a trumpet-like form.

by contracting, temporarily suspends the flow of blood to the hinder

parts.' This remarkable peculiarity exists not only in the larva of the

lobster, but also in those of the Porcellance, and may be found most pro-

bably in the many other genera, as M. Gerbe has observed the circulation

iu the last somite of the pleon of the brephalus of Cancer, Carchms, and

Palcemon to have interruptions.

The same author states that, ' Although the transitory spines which

arm the thorax ' (carapace) ' of some species do not receive any arterial

branch, a complete circulation is established in their cavity. Some of the
globules which the venous lacunae convey to the heart, make a digression

into these transitory appendages, traverse nearly their whole length, and

return by a parallel course into the lacuna from which tliey started.

M. Felix Plateau, of Ghent, has, through the agency of a graphic

method, succeeded in obtaining a delineation of the heart's action in the

Acrayfish.  curve is obtained, of which the ascending portions correspond

to diastole, and the descending to systole, contrary to w^iat obtains in the

heart of vertebrate animals.

     It is, he says, strikingly like the trace of the contraction of a

--muscle a rapid, almost sudden ascent, with a flat summit, then a

gradual descent, at first quicker, then slower. This, however, does not

represent the whole truth; it is possible also to demonstrate a wave

affecting the muscular wall of the heart, and travelling from behind
forwards, thus demonstrating that this condensed heart is a true dorsal

vessel. On the stimulus of the entrance of renovated blood, it is only the

hinder half or two-thirds of the heart that contracts immediately. This
forces the blood into the anterior half, which contracts while the posterior

division is dilating. When the temperature is increased, as a general rule

the diastolic phase is abbreviated, the number of pulsations rising at the
same time. M. Plateau has also succeeded in making experiments on the

action of the cardiac nerve of Lemoine, an unpaired branch of the stomato-
gastric ganglion. It is shown that excitation of this nerve quickens the
pulsations of the heart and augments their energy, while the division of
it lessens the heart's action. Whereas excitation of the pereionic ganglia
always retards the heart's movements, being the converse of a similar treat-

ment of the cai'diac nerve.
     M. Plateau likewise says that acetic acid applied to the heart-substance

arouses its contractions even after they have ceased, and maintains them

for several hours. ·

     M. Jobert, in the ' Annales des Sciences Naturelles,' 6th ser. vol. 4, has
drawn attention to the character of respiration in the terrestrial Crustacea of

the decapod order. He says that in an examination of the anatomy of these
animals we iind that they are provided with branchia the same as other

crabs both marine and fluviatile, and their habit of life in relation to
these organs, which are essentially constructed for aquatic respiration,
appears to be paradoxical, and has not escaped the attention of naturalists.
In 1825 Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire suggested that the ridges which line the

--respiratory cavity of Birgus latro assisted the respiration an hypothesis

that in 1828 was combated by MM. Milne-Edwards and Andouin, who

studied the respiratory cavity of the Gecarcinida;, and attributed to a fold
in the membrane which lined the internal cavity, the power of storing up
a supply of water, with which it regularly laved the branchial apparatus,
this water not serving respiration directly, but by its slow evaporation
saturating with moisture the air which is brought into contact with the
branchia, and so precluding the dessication of these organs.

     M. Jobert has endeavoured to verify the correctness of these two
opinions, and for this purpose has studied the habit of living specimens
of Uca, Gelassimus, Cardisoma, Orapsus, Telphusa, and Tylocarcinns.

    He takes as typical, Uca ttjiar, in which the respiratory apparatus is the

most complete, and points out the vai-ious modifications which he has

noticed among the other Crustacea.
     The branchial chamber is lined with a soft blackish grey membrane

in continuity with the vertical septum {cloison^. In a histological study of
this membrane we find the elements of tihe hypodermic membrane of Crus-
tacea, for instance, large pigmentary cellules, special hypodermic cellules,
and some peculiar fibres, either solitary or nnited in bundles in the form of
X, which exist all over the membrane. This membrane is lined or covered
by another very thin membrane capable of being separated from it by the
aid of maceration in a very weak solution of acetic acid, and it appears
to be a thin surface of chitin.

     M. Jobert opened more than 200 specimens after having been confined
for two, four, and six days in a perfectly dry place, and never found a drop
of water, or ever found the surface of the branchia moist ; the cavity was

always fall of air, whicli the animal had not the power to expel, and even

after submersion of the animal in water for three days some Uca had still

a considerable quantity of air in the upper part of the branchial vaults.

By the researches of Milne-Edwards and Andouin, we know that the

ai-terial blood traverses vessels which become smaller and smaller, but is

not taken up by the capillary veins, that it passes into some lacuna; in com-

munication with the general cavity, and a portion of the branchiae, and

that after it has been revivified in these organs it is taken up by vessels

which carry it into the pericardiac chamber, which is no other than an

Aauricula : from thence into the heart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

                                                                             coloured injection demonstrates

if the canals of the resj^iratory membranes are arterial or venous. It also

shows a network of extreme beauty that ramifies upon the vault, both

on the internal and external parietes of the respiratory chamber. This

network is regularly developed, and commences in a large sinus situated

in the anterior part behind the orbital cavity. It divides into three

vessels which ramify on the vertical septum (cloison), and another vessel of

very large diameter which traverses the angle of connexion between the

carapace and the lateral walls of the branchial cavity. Of the other

vessels of less importance, one of which should be noticed, it curves and

ramifies in the folded membrane described by Milne-Edwai'ds and Andouin.

All these vessels send forth a number of branches which resolve into

capillaries that terminate in small irregular polygonal spaces, which are

the true lacunae                                                             but from these lacunte other equally delicate vessels take
                                                                          ;

their departure. They may be observed to enlarge and open into still

larger vessels, which still increase in size and open in their turn into a

large trunk, which opens into an enormous sinus situated posteriorly to

the pereion (or body of the animal) near where the pleon commences,

about a centimetre within and above the basal portion of the last pair of

feet. This large sinus traverses the vertical septum (cloison) and opens;

into the auricle.

   A coloured injection forced into the sinus gives evidence of vascular

network nearly symmetrical with that observed so regularly di.^played on

the walls of the respiratory chamber. Of these vessels one ramifies on the

vertical septum, the other, which is of considerable diameter, winds upon

the roof of the chamber. Another equally worthy of notice is situated in
the angle of the internal membrane folded horizontally on the walls of the

chamber.

There consequently exists, according to M. Jobert, in the parietes of

the respiratory chamber a double system of vessels connected together by
an intermediate capillary network inducing communication direct between
the heart and the general cavity.

The air which is contained in the respiratory chamber never stagnates,

but is renewed very regularly by the aid of a true movement of inspiration
and expiration. The expiratory orifice of the ch.amber offers nothing very

particular ; whereas the inspiratory, in addition to that v/hich is situated at>
the anterior part of the first pair of feet, is supplemented by others smaller
but still important, situated between the third and fourth and posterior

pairs, having the orifices externally hid by long hairs. It is to the
vertical septum that the power belongs that induces the alternating
movements of inspiration and expiration, and that iinder the influence of
the central organ of circulation. In Uca, where the heart is of consider-

able size, we may observe at the period of the afflux of the blood into

the cavity a corresponding movement outside the vertical septum which
236 EEPOKT-- 1880.

separates the general cavity of the respiratory chamber, produced by a
special mechanism.

     M. Jobert found this respiratory chamber largest in Uca Una, the
reflexion of the membrane most developed, the vascular vessels the most

numerous. Gelassimus, he says, may be considered as possessing an
organism nearly as perfect. Among the Grapsi, which live half of their

time under water, the respiratory cavity is diminished by the flattenino-

of the carapace, and the vascular network is less abundant.

Under all circumstances M. Jobert found a respiratory organisation

similar to that which exists in all Crustacea, but capable of undergoing a

distinct usage. The organisation consists of a simple cavity, the membrane

which lines it is furnished with  vessels                                        one               carrying  deoxygenised
                                                                              ;

blood, the other returning it to the heart without passing it through the

branchiffi, after it has been brought into contact with air that has been

incessantly renewed. Moi-eovei-, this membrane is covered by a pellicle
which precludes desiccation and fulfils the part of a veritable epidermis.

In consequence of the observations which M. Jobert has made, he

proposes to call the Crustacea so organised by the name of ' Branchio-

pulmones,' in consequence of the capability by which their structure per-
mits them to adapt themselves to atmospheric respiration, while they

possess an anatomical arrangement that is essentially aquatic.

    Professor Huxley has recently given much attention to the arrange-
ment of the branchia in Crustacea, and has done good sei-vice in suggest-

ing a tabulation of them under a distinct nomenclature.

The position of the bi-anchial plumes are constant throughout the

several orders, and are absent or present according to specific or generic

variation. He thus has proposed that each plume should be distinguished

by a name that will at once recognise its position, and has proposed the

following classification. The branchia that is rooted to the coxa of the

several pairs of pereiopoda he calls imdohmnchia. The two that are

situated on the articulating tissue that unites the appendnge Avith the
body of the animal, he calls anterior or posterior artliropoda, and the one

that originates from the side or wall of the .several somites of the pereion

lie calls pJeurohmnchia. To the long flabelliform lash that is so liable

to vary both in form, size and number, he uses the two names proposed by
Milne-Edwards for the same homotypical part, when attached to the organs

of the mouth, or when ap]3ended to the leet, namely, the Ejngnathe and

epipodite, an inconvenience that he himself lias expressed when writing of
the same in his work on the Crayfish. This, Milne-Edwards in his

earlier works recognised by the title of the flabelliform appendage. It

appears to me therefore that a term recognising the part in its true

relation wherever existing will be found both more convenient as well as
more correct in anatomical description. I have therefore elsewhere

adopted for it the term of Mastihranchia^ (branchial lash).

The same author has also proposed the classification of the macrura

according to their branchial arrangement. But the study of a larger
number of species is yet necessary, before we can see the advantage of

placing in separate families, animals that in form and structure generally

resemble each other, while others that are outwardly dissimilar are placed

in the same genus.

Willemos-Salim, investigated the metamorphosis of some Crustacea which
were repeatedly captured in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of the

Pacific'

    Among these he obtained many specimens of Amphion, and of its

brephalus (larva) not only of the true zosea with a simple telson, but also
of all the intermediate stages between it and the adult form, with two,

three, four,, five and six pairs of walking legs. Of the full-grown Amfldon
he had examined three specimens, two of which were undoubtedly males,
as the testes and branchiaa were plainly visible, the former opening into

the last pair of legs.

     He was thus able to endorse Anton Dorhn's researches, wherein he

dissected a full-grown specimen which possessed branchias and an ovarj-.

     There is, he says, now no doubt that Ampliion is not a larva, but that

there arc several species, and perhaps genera, of this remarkable form.
For during the expedition they had captured two very interesting mature
animals which are closely allied to Amphion. One of these has enormously
long eye-stalks, being as long as the entire body of the animal. Another

has, besides the long eye-stalks, the carpus of its several pereiopoda,

very broad and paddle-shaped, while the dactylos is very minute. Both
these forms, like Amphion, have a ceotral ocular spot and eight pairs of legs,
each supporting an ecphysis. But, as a whole, the animal is less flat and
more resembles Sergesfes than Ampliion ; and he states also that he has been
able to determine that the form described by A. Dorhn under the name of
Elaphocaris is the brephalus of a Sergestes. There is, however, one species,
he says, which in the brephalus stage is not an Elaphocaris, but a larger
and less spiny form, but similar in all other respects.

     The manner in which ElapTiocaris matures into the perfect Sergestes, he
has been enabled to determine from the numerous specimens that he
collected in tlie Western Pacific. After the first moulting the brephalus
gets six more branched legs and loses many spines. It enters the Amphion
stage, then moults, throws off the branched legs, gets branchia, and becomes

a spiny Sergestes. It is only after this last moulting that the central

ocular spot disappears.

    He also observes that very similar to the development of Sergestes is

that of Leucifer. The earliest form that he had obtained had no eyes,
then sessile ones appear, and the animal then presents the form which Dana
has called JErictMna demissa. After the second moulting the eyes are pro-
jected on stalks, and very long hairs are apparent on all the animal's
appendages, and the animal appears a long and very delicate zosea. It
now enters the Amphion stage, but never gets more than four pairs of
pereiopoda, and even loses a pair of these when it moults, and puts on the
adult form of Leucifer, in which two pairs of pereiopoda are wanting.

    It appears to me that instead of confirming the opinion of Anton
Dorhn that Amphion is an animal in the adult stage, the observation of

the accomplished naturalist of the Challenger rather induces one to believe
that it is only a stage in the development of some of the Schizopod Crus-

tacea. The brephalus of Amphion, Sergestes, or Leucifer he has not been
able to determine, inasmuch as he had never been able to obtain them. It
is singular that Amphion was never taken excepting during the night.

     M. Gerbe ^ says that the central nervous system of the larvte of crus-

tacea presents differences in its arrangement and form from that of the

perfect individual, and the development of each of the medullary nuclei

which constitute the ganglionic masses is in relation to the development

of the organs to which these nuclei correspond.

     Herr C. E. Wassiliew ' has given an account of his investigations of

the curious ' green gland ' of the crayfish. He states that it consists of a

single unbroken coiled tube, closed at one end and opening at the other

into the sac of the gland or urinary bladder, and consists of three distinct

portions. The first of these has the form of a somewhat triangular yel-

lowish-brown lobule, lying at the upper surface of the gland and forming

the  blind  terminal  portion of  the whole  tube                         the second forms a green
                                                                       ;

cake-shaped mass, constituting the lateral and inferior parts of the gland

while the third is a long, white, coiled tube, connected a.t the end with

the green portion and by the other opening into the bladder.

     The entire tubular gland is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells,

outside which is a fine structureless tunica propria, containing strongly

refracting nuclei. There is no cuticular lining to the tube, which thus

differs very markedly from the malpighian vessels of insects.

     In the yellow portion the cells are sharply defined and convex on

their inner surface. In the green part of the tube the cells are large, and

their protoplasm is in connection with a peculiar network of pseudopo-

deal processes which extend into projections of the wall into the lumen

of the tube. In the proximal portion (that nearest to the green section)

of the white part of the tube the walls are smooth, and lined by small

cells approximating the pavement form. In its distal portion mammili-

form and dendritic processes of the wall project into the cavity, often

giving the tube a spongy appearance, and the cells have long bi'oad pro-

cesses developed from their inner surfaces. The epithelium of the bladder

agrees with that of the smooth portion of the tube.

     The products of secretion are seen in the white and green, but not in

the yellow portion of the gland, as yellowish, rather highly refracting,

drops on the surface of the cells. Probably the yellow part seci'etes

a substance soluble in alcohol. That part of the white tube, with the

tesselated epithelium, most likely acts mei'cly as a duct.

     The anterior portion of the gland and bladder are supplied by a branch

of the antennary arteries, their posterior portions by the sternal arteries
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

these break up into a rich network of capillaries in all parts of the gland.

The nerve-supply of the bladder is also derived from two sources, its an-

terior part being supplied by a branch of antennary nerves (coming from

the supra-cesophageal ganglion), its posterior part by a nerve from the

supra- oesophageal ganglion, but no nerves have been observed in the

gland itself.

     This same green gland has been studied by Professor Huxley and Mr.

Martin, who, in an elementary woi'k on practical biology, describes it as

a soft greenish mass lying on each side of the extreme front part of the

cephalon, and that a fine bristle may be passed in through an aperture
on the first joint of the antenna?. And in his more recent work on the

crayfish. Professor Huxley accepts, with apparently little doubt, that the

green gland is the representative of the kidney. ' The green gland,' he

writes, ' is said to contain a substance termed guanin (so named because

it is found in the guano, which is the accumulated excrement of birds),

green glaud rej^resents the kidnej-, and its secretion the urinary fluid,

while the sac is a sort of urinary bladder.'

The evidence on which this newly-proposed use of the green gland

rests is the mild statement of Will and Gorup-Besanez (I quote from the

notes in Professor Huxley's 'Crayfish' '), who say that in this organ and

in the organ of Bojanus of the fresh-water mussel, they found ' a sub-

stance, the reactions of which, with the greatest probability, indicate

guanin,' but that they had been unable to obtain sufficient material to

give decisive results.

"When we consider the position of this organ in its relation to the

other parts, as they ai'e arranged in separate genera, very definite analyses

ought to be determined before a cautious anatomist can accept this idea

as proven.

There is an osseous tubercle on the first joint of the antenna that is

hollow, the orifice being covered by a thin translucent membrane, in the

centre of which there is a narrow pei-foration. This tubercle Milne-Edwards

and most carcinological students have thought to be the passage con-

nected with acoustic properties, but which I have always contended was

related to the olfactory sense ; but as the observations of Will and

Gorup-Besanez, although published in 1848, have been supported by

Wassiliew in 1878, and Huxlej' in 1879, it will be desirable to allude to this
tubercle by a name that will not commit its relation to any decided use

until so determined. I shall consequently write of it as the Fhymacerite?

This organ is always in connexion with the coxa or first joint of the

second pair of antennfe, even in those Crustacea in which the antennaj are so

fused into the frontal region (or metopus), that without previous know-

ledge it is impossible to determine its relation to the antennfe. In these

cases, as in most of the higher types of the Brachyura, it is so concentrated

into the animal that it is very generally covered and protected by the

appendages of the mouth, and it is always closely associated with that

organ. Moreover, the watery sac is so delicate in its structure that it is

--diflacult to dissect it without rupturing its walls a circumstance that I
--have never succeeded in doing in the Brachyura and the passage of an

inserted bristle must puncture its walls at any point.

     In the Amphipoda the entrance is through a long spine, and the
membranous passage is slightly winding. In the Isopoda I never observed

any, at least conspicuous, tubercle. In the Brachyura it is generally closed
by an osseous ojjcrculum.

Writing on this same organ, Milne-Edwards says : ' The Crustacea, or

at least those of the higher ordei's, possess                                                                              also the sense of                  hearing                                 the

experiments of Minasi, as shown by a number of daily observations,

furnish proof that, among a great number of these animals, there exists an

apparatus that appears to be the seat of this faculty.

' This organ is situated on the inferior surface of the head, in advance

of the mouth, and behind the second pair of antennas, or even in the

basilaire joint of the antennae itself. In the crayfish, as exliibited by the

--researches of Scarpa, it exists at this place on each side of the body

little osseous tubercle (Phymacerlie) of which the summit presents a

du vestibule des animaux superieurs " (PI. XII. fig. 11 and 11 bis). Behind

this membrane, at the base of the tnbei-cle, we find a little membranous

vesicle full of an aqueous fluid, which receives on the inner and upper

surface a nervous filament given off from the antennal branch. Moreover,

it is capped by a spongy mass, of which Scarpa makes no mention, which

appears to be well adapted for an organ of hearing, although some narrow

bands unite it to the organ of which we are about to speak (PI. XII.

fig. 9a). It is this organ which has already been considered as connected

with the sense of smell. In the Langouste (Palinurus), in the centre of the

membrane that closes the aperture of the antennal tubercle (Phymacerite)

is a small opening which communicates with a disc-like organ (I'organe

en form de galette) the object of which is doubtful, and for the most part

among the Brachyura is entirely replaced by a small osseous, more or less
movable, disc. In Maia and some other short-tailed Crustacea, the dis-

position of this kind of operculum is very cui-ious ; we have ascertained,
M. Andouin and myself, that on the anterior border there exists a tolerably

large osseous plate which is bent at right angles and directed upwards

towards the organ, and forms a disc that terminates in a point ; near its

base this lamellous prolongation is pierced by a great oval foramen, and

this kind of opening is closed by a thin elastic membrane which we shall

call the internal auditory membrane, and near which the auditory nerve

appears to terminate. Fasciculi of muscles are attached to the extremity

of the osseous lamella, which comes from the opercular disc of the

auditory tubercle (Phymacerite), and which by its form resembles the

stirrup of the human ear                                                                                                                                 finally, upon the anterior border of the external
                                                                                                                                                      ;

opening which is closed by this disc, there exists also a little osseous plate

which is parallel with the internal auditory membrane, and when the

anterior muscle of the ossicle contracts, so as to be slightly thrown back,

all the little apparatus before the membrane to which we allude becomes

more and more extended.

     ' After the researches made on the transmission of sound by M. Savart,
we know that the existence of an opening closed by a thin elastic membrane

is a condition most available for the increase of the power of heai-ing

delicate sounds. This savant has observed that pieces of cardboard which

are not susceptible to vibration so as to determine the form of regular

figures in the fine sand placed upon the surface, are capable of so becoming
when they were covered with a membranous disc. It is then to be presumed

that the kind of drum that we now describe as that of the external auditory
membrane of the crayfish, serves to communicate to the auditory nerve

the vibrations that are transmitted to it, and which afiect but little or

nothing the sounding parts that are not in direct communication with

these membranes. The mechanism by means of which the internal

auditory membrane can be alternately relaxed or extended is analogous to

that which is produced in the human ear by the action of the chain of

ossicles, which traverses the cavity of the ear, and its effects may be sup-

posed to be of the same kind. It serves to augment or diminish the

undulations which strike the vibrating membrane, and to modify the

intensity of the sounds which strike the ear.'

That this organ is not connected with hearing is now, I believe,

accepted by those who have inquired into the subject, since organs

resembling otolithes have been found in the coxa of the first pair of

antennse, and in the inner ramus of the posterior pair of pleopoda.
       ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT FROM COAL-GAS.  241

     The green gland in Palinmnis is very large, and I have been subjectino-

it to examination as to its form and structure, as well as placed the

seci'etion contained in the sac connected with it in the hands of an
expert chemist, but the results have not sufficiently progressed to enable

me to embody them in this report.

Report on the best means for the Development of Light from Coal-

     Gas of different qualities, by a Committee consisting of Dr.

    William Wallace (Secretary), Professor Dittmar, and Mr. John
    Pattinsox, F.G.S., F.I.G. Drawn up by Mr. Pattinson.

       Part II.

The first part of this Report, which was presented at the meeting of the

Bi'itish Association in 1878, had reference chiefly to the use of cannel gas

such as supplied in most of the towns of Scotland, and which has an
illuminating power equal to 26 candles when burned in a union-jet

burner at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour and under a pressure of 0'5

inch. It also pointed out the best means known of burning this quality

of gas, and gave the results of photometric testing of several kinds of

burners under varying conditions of pressure.

     It is the object of this second part of the Report to give similar infor-

mation regarding the burning of what is known as common gas, or gas
made from the common bituminous coal of the Newcastle and other coal-

fields, or from this class of coal mixed with a small quantity of cannel

coal, and having an illuminating power equal to 16 standard sperm

--candles when consumed at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour in Sugg's

No. 1 London Argand Burner the standard burner adopted in London by
the London Gas Referees, and prescribed in nearly all I'ecent Acts of Par-

liament of gas companies. This quality of gas, or gas varying from 14

to 16 candles illuminating power, is chiefly used in London and in most
towns in England and Ireland.

     The principal condition to be observed, in order to develop the maxi-

mum amount of light from coal gas, is to supply the flame in a suitable

manner with just a sufficient amount of air to effect the complete combus-

tion of the gas. If coal gas is lighted as it issues under a low jjressure
from the end of a gas pipe from which the burner has been removed, it

burns with a long, irregulai'-shaped flame, giving off much smoke, and

yielding a dull yellowish light of very little intensity. The gas has to

ascend to a considerable height before it meets with sufficient air to con-

sume it comjjletely, and the upward currents created by the heat waft the

languid flame about in all directions and cause it to give off smoky par-

ticles. On the other hand, if the gas is forced under considerable pressure

through a very small orifice or very narrow slit, it burns with a thin bluish

flame, without visible smoke, and yielding very little light. The small,

rapid stream of gas, by virtue of the force with which it issues, becomes
mixed at once with such an excessive amount of air that the carbonaceous

constituents of the gas, instead of being partially separated and made in-

candescent, are converted at once into carbonic acid in a flame havino-

little or no luminosity, just as when gas is burned in a Bunsen burner.

These illustrate two cases in which air is supplied to the flame in an un-

1880.  K

suitable manner, one in wliicli air is supplied too slowly, and the other in

-which it is too rapidly mixed with the gas. As in flat-flame burners the

air supply is chiefly regulated by means of the pressure under which the

gas is allowed to issue, it is necessary to avoid these two extremes in order

to develop the light-giving properties of the gas. The dimensions of the

orifice through which the gas issues from such burners, and the velocity

with which it issues, should be so adapted to each other that the gas in

burning is brought into contact with air in such a manner that the heat

developed from a portion of the burning gas heats the remainder to a high

state of incandescence before it is ultimately entirely oxidised. The

quality of a flat-flame burner depends almost entirely on the extent to

which this condition is fulfilled. Tn Argand burners, or at any rate in

those of the best consti-uction, the due supply of air is admitted to the

interior and exterior of the cylinder of flame, and regulated by means of

the chimney and cone, the gas being allowed to issue from the burner

Aunder little or no pressure.  more complete control is thus obtained

over the air supply than is possible in the case of flat-flame burners, and

it is probably on this account that more light can be developed from com-

mon gas when burned in good Argand burners than when burned in

ordinary quantities in flat-flame burners.

     The efiect of the pressure under which gas is caused to issue upon
the air supply, and consequently upon the amount of light emitted, is
shown in the following results of experiments made with union-jet and
batwing burners having orifices of various dimensions and unprovided
with any means of checking jiressnre. The gas was caused to pass
through them under different pressures applied by means of a weighted

gas-holder.

     The gas used was equal to 16 candles when tested with the standard

--burner Sugg's No. 1 London Argand.

issuing from No. 2 batwing under a pressure of 1-5 inches is compared
with the result of burning tlie amounts of gas nearest to this amount in

the case of each of the other burners, it will be seen that the illuminating

power increases as the pressure required to send the desired amount of
gas through the burner decreases ; or, in other words, the illuminating
power is increased as the gas, issuing with less velocity, is thus mixed or
brought into contact with less air. The following figures taken from the
above table show this :

the illuminating power is improved, and some experiments made in the
laboratory of the University of Llunich go to show that an increase of
18 per cent, in the illaminating power -was produced by heating the gas
from 64^ degrees to 288 degrees Fahrenheit. The London Gas Referees,

in an able report on the construction of gas-burners, issued in 1871,

repeated this experiment, and found no appreciable difference in the
illuminating power of gas on heating the gas before burning from about

68 degrees to 296 degrees Fahrenheit. One of us has recently tried the

same experiment. The gas was caused to pass through about 6 feet of

copper tubing, heated to dull redness. By this means the gas was heated

from 58 degrees up to 350 degrees, as indicated by a thermometer placed
in the current of the gas within 6 inches of the burner. It was found

necessary to open wider the tap of the meter as the temperature rose, in

order to pass exactly the required quantity of 5 cubic feet per horn*, the

heated and expanded gas requiring more time to pass through the burner
than the same quantity of cold gas. Careful observations were made of

the illuminating power as the temperature rose. The result was that no

appi-eciable difference could be seen in the illuminating power even at the

-- --highest temperature reached 350 degi-ees Fahrenheit thus confirming

the results obtained by the London Gas Referees. As the temperature of

combustion would be increased by heating the gas, and consequently a

higher degree of incandescence produced, some increase of the illumi-

nating power may be expected, but the increase of temperature tried

(and it is very difficult to heat the gas even so high as 350 degrees) is

evidently too insignificant to produce any appi-eciable increase in the illu-

minating power.

    An experiment to try the effect of heating the air supplied to the

burner was more successful in producing an appreciable impi-ovement in

the illuminating power. The air was supplied from a holder under

pressure. It was passed through a heated copper tube, and from thence

into the bottom of the standard Argand burner, which was closed,

Aexcepting to the admission of the heated air.  thermometer was fixed

in the current of heated air about 6 inches from the burner. There was

no difficulty in heating the air to a temperature of 520 degrees Fahrenheit.

At this heat the soldering of the apparatus gave Avay, so that no higher

temperature was tried. The temperature of the uuheated air was 70

degrees, and the gas used, when supplied with air of this temperature,
gave a light equal to 16 candles per o cubic feet per hour. As the tem-

perature of the air was increased, the illuminating power gradually rose,

--until at 520 degrees a light equal to 17'5 candles was pi-oduced a rise of

a candle and a half, or about 9 per cent., for an increase of 450 degrees in

the temperature of the air supply. As the amount of heat sujjplied by

the heated air brought into contact with the gas and the flame is consider,

able, an appreciable effect is produced on the temperature of the flame,

and consequently on its illuminating power. It would appear, however,

that the principle of heating the air supply is not likely to be a lopted for

general lighting purposes, for the additional light which any practicable

amount of heating would cause to be obtained would probably not com-

pensate for the exti-a cost and trouble attending the use of the required

apparatus.

   A number of burners of various kinds, now supplied to the public,

have been tested with common coal gas, having an illuminating power

 eqnal to 16 standard speiin candles, when burned at the rate of 5 cubic
 feet per hour in Sugg's No. 1 London Argand Burner, and the results
 obtained are given in the following tables. The standard candle, as in the

 case of cannel gas, is one consuming 120 grains of sperm per hour.
 The photometric apparatus and the method of testing employed were
 about the same as those described in the first part of this report. The
 two jets representing the candles were supplied with gas from a separate
 gas-holder, always kept under exactly the same pressure. The gas con-
 sumed in the burners to be tested was also supplied from a separate
 holder, to which any required pressure could be readily applied. For
 comparison, the results obtained are calculated into the amount of light
 for a consumption of 5 cubic feet per hour in each case.

      Of the four classes of burners described in the first part of this report,
the ' rat-tail ' or single-jet burner is now seldom or never used for common
gas for lighting purposes. The union-jet or fish-tail burner, the batwing
burner, and the Argand burner, or modifications of these various burners,
are now almost exclusively used. These burners and their modifications
have for the most part been already fully described, and it is therefore
unnecessary to repeat these descriptions at any length.

     Messrs. Bray and Co. manufacture a great variety of flat-flame burners.
Their ' Regulator ' burner checks the pressure of gas in the mains by
means of layers of muslin inserted in the burner. Their ' Special

burner, in addition to the layers of muslin, has also a piece of a kind of
porcelain, containing a round hole of less area than the exit orifices,
placed below the muslin, through which the gas passes into the burner.

--These ' regulator ' and ' sjDecial ' burners are made in three different

forms union-jets, batwings, and a modification of the batwing called a
'slit-union.' The latter, owing to a peculiar chambering out of the head
of the burner, forms a narrower and liigher flame than the ordinary bat-
wing, and is therefore better adapted for use in globes. This form of
batwing is also made by various other makers. Besides the burners

already mentioned, Messrs. Bray and Co. also make each form of burner
of high lighting power and of medium lighting power, and they recom-
mend the medium lighting power burners in preference to the others for

general use, as having less tendency to smoke.

    Of these burners of Messrs. Bray & Co., the following have been

selected for trial :

--Another form of street burner a 'double-flame' burner-- is made by

them. This is formed by two burners being so placed that the flames from
Wethe two join together a little above the burner.

have been tested with 16-candle gas at pressures of 0"5 inch, 8 inch, and

those obtained with the standard Argand burner :

a pressiire of 1 inch.

     Besides other flat-flame burners, Sagg has recently manufactured a
large burner for large consumption of gas, which he calls a ' table-top '

burner. This has a flat disc-shaped head with a semispherical centre,

in which the slit is formed. Each burner is fitted with a govei-nor. Two

of these have been tested with the gas supplied to the governors at the
under-mentioned pressures, and the following results obtained :

With smaller amounts the loss of light by the excessive supply of air

which then enters the chimney is much greater than in the case of flat-
flame burners of good quality. On burning various quantities of gas
through the standard Argand used for testing, the following results were

obtained :

of gas are passed, often imperceptibly, throngli the same burner. In most
of the burners tested for the purposes of this Report, and which are not
provided with means of checking the pressure, it will be seen that about

twice as much gas is passed through the burner at 1'5 inches pressure as

is passed through at 0*5 inch pressure, and the pi'essure in the mains often
Tai'ies more than this. The amounts of gas passed through a burner
without obstruction for checking pressure with and without a governor at
different pressures is shown in the following table :

myI shall proceed to discuss in how fai* each of these jsarts of  pro-

gramme has been carried out, but must first explain that almost imme-

diately after my arrival in Mexico my health commenced to suffer ; that

indisposition soon passed into illness, and that this illness, aggravated

by very severe, and as it after svards turned out, mistaken medical

treatment, confined me to my room for ujjwards of two months,
and left me utterly enfeebled. After my recovery I remained more

than a month in hopes of recovering strength and returning to work,

and even attempted a few excursions, e.g. to the caves of Caca-

huamilpa; but was at length compelled to yield to the urgent advice

of my physicians and relatives, and return to Scotland to recruit my

health. I therefore sailed from Vera Cruz on 1st March last. It will thus

be readily understood that my results, gathered as they are from a period
of a few weeks after my arrival (during which my time was largely

occupied in the preliminary work of gathering information and improving

ray knowledge of the language, not to speak of failing health), are neces-
sarily of the most imperfect kind, and that, of various undertakings, well

begun, bu^t never finished, nothing can be said at all. I hope, however, to

make my memoranda useful to another explorer, my friend M. Joyeux-

Laffuie, D.Sc, who proposes shortly to undertake a similar and I trust a

more fortunate expedition to Mexico.

For dredging on the coast there was of course no time. I am con-

vinced, however, that excellent results await the fortunate naturalist who

can devote a winter to the task, particularly on the Pacific side, which is

completely unexplored.

   My collections, though small, were by no means valueless. I obtained

a number of plants, mainly from the ravines eroded by streams in the
alluvial of the Plateau, and these are of considerable interest, since
many are of subtropical fades, belonging to a zone of vegetation consi-
derably warmer and lower than the Plateau itself. This tends to throw
some light upon the migrations of plants in these countries. The plants
growing on the sides of ravines being protected from inclemencies of

weather, better exposed to the sun, &c., are thus enabled to reach altitudes

otherwise uninhabitable by them. I have presented these dried plants
to the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, where also
some of their seeds are being grown.

   My zoological collection is deposited in the British Museum. It con-

sisted of a few mammals, of which two are of considerably rarity, viz. :

Spermophilus Mexicanus, Licht., and Blarma micrura, Tomes ; twenty-five

reptiles, fifty-two fish, twelve crustaceans, and a few insects. Some of
the reptiles, fishes, and crustaceans are of interest to the systematic
zoologist, and a note upon some of the crustaceans has just been published
by Mr. Miers in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History.' I was
also able to pro\ade Professor Huxley with a small collection of crayfishes

and prawns.

     The microscopical investigation, too, had commenced to yield results of
interest. Although in aiitumn the general fades was surprisingly Euro-
pean, yet new and strange Protozoa, Rotifers, &c., were by no means rare.

     Despite all hindrances, however, the main inquiry, as to the age and

contents of the superficial deposits of the Plateau, came much nearer to a

--solution. The Plateau is covered to an unknown depth so great that the
256 EEPOET--1880.

--Artesian "wells ·svLicli are frequently bored never reach the bottom with

a series of lacustrine deposits, earthy, clayey, and sandy. Most frequently

the alluvium contaius a great quantity of pumice and volcanic ash, and

then acquires so much consistence as to be used in the cheaper and less

Adurable kinds of building.            con^siderable area is covered by lakes,

Chalco. Xochimilco, Tezcocn, &c., and these, particularly the latter, have

diminished greatly since the Spanish Conquest. The principal lake, into

which all the others drain, Tezcoco, is very shallow, nowhere more than
fonr or five feet deep, and has no definite limits, but alters its area by

many square miles in the course of every season. It is easy to see that the

various lakes now scattered over the Plateau are merely the remnants of

one vast lake, whose shallow watei's extended over the vast plain around

the site of the City of Mexico, and which received the torrents which

come down from the surrounding mountains every rainy season laden

with detritus. Meanwhile the volcanoes, which are scattered over and

around the Plateau, were in great activity, and the surface of the lake

seems to have been generally either wholly or partly covered with pumice

and ashes, which as the waters receded during di'ougbt wonld be deposited

along with the mud at the bottom.

     It is interesting to compare the lava-flows Avhich have been emitted
on what was at the time dry land with those which were formed in the

lake itself. The former, such as the Pedregal de Thalpan, are dense,

hard,  and black,  like  the  lava of  Vesuvius                                            the latter,  e.g. the two little

hills near ]\Iesico, known respectively as the Great and Little Peiion, are

gigantic cinders, red, cracked and porous, and here and there containing

large irregular caves, formed simply by the expansion of the included

water into steam.

     All over the Plateau, imbedded in the soft alluvium or in the denser
' tipitate ' as the rock containing j^imice is called, and frequently laid
bare by the streams, are to be fonnd considerable numbers of mammalian

skeletons. To examine and collect these I made a good many expeditions,
generally accompanied by one or two Indians, who served as guides and
excavators. I obtained many sjjecimens, nearly all, however, in very
imperfect preservation, and many so friable as scarcely to bear removal.

The most abundant I'emains are those of Elephas. Mastodon, however,

occasionally occurs, and skeletons of horses, buffaloes, and wolves are

tolerably common. I was much interested by the fact that some time

before and again during my visit a specimen of Glyptodon, apparently

clavipes, had "been found in the course of some engineering work, and

had come into the possession of the museum there, thus establishing the

rano-e of this genus of Edentates into the northern part of the Neotropical

reo-ion. I was fortunate in discovering a magnificent Edentate skeleton,

closely resembling Myhdon ; but, on returning with my workmen early

next morning to continue the excavation, we found our specimen shattered
into fragments. Some of the country people, who always watched one's
movements with intense suspicion, and who alternately regarded us as
treasure-seekers and as magicians, so adding considerably to the danger
and discomfort of the undertaking, had done this, and we were able only
to rescue a single broken tooth, now in the British Museum.

    On my way home I examined, along with Mr. Halliday, C.B., of Vera

Cruz, an artesian well which he was boring in hopes of obtaining a supply

of water for that city. He had passed through 1260 feet of sands and

Your Committee has to report that on the 7th of June last Mr. Dillwyn,
M.P., obtained leave from the House of Commons to bring in a Bill to
amend the Laws relating to the Protection of Wild Birds, which Bill was

read a second time on the 14th, and ordered to be considered in Committee
of that House on the 21st of June.

     Owing to the late period at which the Bill was introduced, the rapid

progi'esa of its earlier stages, and the difiBculty of communicating with
some members of your Committee, an attempt to fix a meeting failed, and
your Committee, as a body, had therefore no opportunity of discussing
this Bill, nor, if need were, of reporting thereon to the Council of the
Association according to its instructions. In their private capacity some

members of your Committee, conceiving that the Bill contained much that
was objectionable, are understood to have made representations to that
effect to various members of the House of Commons whom they believed

to be interested in the subject. The Bill passed thi-ough Committee of

the House of Commons on the 21st of June, and, in consequence of the

various amendments then adopted, assumed an entirely different aspect
from that which it originally presented, several of the features believed to
have been regarded by some members of your Committee as most objec-
tionable having disappeared. In this state it was read a third time in the
House of Commons, and was sent to the House of Lords on the 15th of

July.

     In the House of Lords charge was taken of it by Lord Aberdare, and
it received very careful consideration, several important amendments pro-
posed by him and by Lords Lilford and Walsingham being made in it, both
in Committee and on Report, and it was read the third time on the 15th of

August.

    The Bill now awaits the approval of the House of Commons to the

Lords' amendments.
     Tour Committee, for the reasons above assigned, having been unable

to discuss this Bill, refrains from offering any remarks upon it, and, while

trusting that the new measure may prove to be efficient, begs leave to

submit this short statement of facts.

Certain spectroscopic changes and variations, wliich we now know to bc-
common botb to metals and metalloids, were first observed in the case of

metalloids. It is owing to this fact tliat their spectra have given rise to

so much discussion. Angstrom and v. d. Willigen had examined electric

sparks passing through various gases, and had thus observed the spectra

of several                       metalloids                                                                                    but the subject first  received due attention when
                                                                                                   ;

Plucker and Hittorf (1804) announced the important discovery that one

and the same element can, under different conditions, show more than one

spectrum.' Attempts were naturally made to disprove such a remarkable

and at first sight improbable assertion. DiSerent spectroscopists took

different views                                                                    most metalloids were carefully examined, and in the long
                                                                                ;

dif^cussion which followed, each side had to give in on some points.

Pliicker's discovery, however, was established in the case of all metalloids

Avhich have been sufficiently well studied. There is now among those

best able to judge a general agreement on the facts, although great diffei--

Weences exist as to their interpretation.                                                                                                             have in the present Report

nothing to do with the explanations which have been offered to account

lor the variability of spectra, but only to record facts and to desci'ibe the
phenomena which appear when the spectra of metalloids are examined

under different and varying conditions.

     It is perhaps advisable to say one word on the nomenclature which

we shall adopt, and on the general appearance of the spectra with which
we have to deal. Different spectra often resemble each other in

general appearance, so that we can classify and roughly divide them into

three                            kinds  or                                         orders                                      continuous  spectra, line  spectra, and  spectra  of
                                                                                                                            :

Anted bands, or channelled-space spectra, as they are sometimes called.

Piiicker and Hittorf called the spectra of fluted bands, spectra of the first

Older                            the line spectra,                                                                             spectra of the second  order.  This nomenclature
                              ;

     ' Both Plucker and v. d. Willigen had already, in 1858, described the band spec-
trum of nitrogen, but the sultject was first tlioroughly investigated by Piiicker and

Hittorf, and only received due attention after the publication of their paper.

is sometimes adopted ; it presents no advantages, but, on the contrary,

Wemay give rise to a good deal of misconception.                                shall not use the

Aexpressions.                   spectrum is called a continuous spectrum when it extends

over a wide range, and is not broken up into separate lines. It is, how-

Weever, not necessary that it should extend through all the colours.

may have a continuous spectrum in the green without an admixture of

red and blue, and we often have continuous spectra which are confined to

one end of the spectrum, either to the red or to the violet.

The spectra of fluted bands or channelled spaces generally appear,

when seen in spectroscopes of small dispersive power, as made up of

bands, which have a sharp boundary on one side and gradually fade away

on the other. When seen with a more perfect instrument, each band

seems to be made up of a number of lines of nearly equal intensity, which

gradually come nearer and nearer together as the sharp edge is approached.

This sharp edge is generally only the place where the lines are ruled so

closely that we cannot distinguish any more the individual components.

The edge is sometimes towards the red, sometimes towards the violet end

of the spectrum. Occasionally, however, the bands of channelled space

spectra do not present any sharp edge whatever ; but are simply made up

of a series of lines which are, roughly speaking, equidistant. In small spec-

troscopes these bands appear to be altogether homogeneous, presenting a

Afairly sharp edge on both sides.                    body, as we shall see, may have more

than one spectrum of the same kind.

Variations in the spectra of gases are generally obtained by a sufficient

alteration in the intensity of the electric discharge, which renders them

Weluminous.                     shall call the discharge which passes, when the electrodes

are connected directly with the terminals of the induction coil, ' the

ordinary discharge,' in contradistinction to the ' jar discharge,' in which

each terminal is also connected with one of the coatings of the Leyden

jar. In order to get the best effect with the jar discharge, it is generally

necessary to interrupt the circuit in some part, so that a spark is forced

to break through the air whenever the discharge passes.

--The Line-spectrum. This spectrum appears whenever a strong spark

(jar discharge) is taken in nitrogen gas. It is always present when

metallic spectra are examined by the ordinary method of allowing the jar

Adischarge to pass between two metallic poles.                        good knowledge of this

spectrum, which is very rich in lines, is important in all cases where

an electric discharge is used for spectroscopic analysis. The spectrum

has been studied especially by Huggins and Thalen. The latter has

given the wave-lengths of all atmospheric lines, but has not separated

the oxygen and nitrogen lines. Huggins' measurements have been

reduced to wave-lengths by Watts (Index of Spectra). At atmospheric

pressure the lines are not shai-p, so that an exact measurement is difficult.

Pliicker and Hittoi'f have given a drawing of the lines as seen in vacuum

tubes with jar and air-break ; but they did not use a sufficient dispersion
for accurate measurement, and their points of reference are so few, that

the reduction to wave-length made by Watts was attended by many

Adifficulties, and the result is not altogether satisfactory.                                                                                                                      careful set of

measui'ements of the nitrogen lines as they appear, when the pressure is

low and with high dispersive power, would be a very useful addition to

our knowledge of this spectrum. The continuous spectrum generally

accompanying this spectrum has been investigated by Wiillner (1869).

  --The Band-fipectrum of the Positive Discharge. This spectrum which is

generally called the ban'l-spectrum of nitrogen, always appears when the

discharge is sufficiently reduced in intensity.

It was first observed by Pliicker (1858) in a vacuum tube, and about

the same tioae by v. d. Willigen in the brush discharge of an ordinary

electrical machine. The best way of obtaining it is that adopted by Pliicker,

who was the first to introduce the shape of vacuum-tubes now generally

in use with the capillary part. Hence these tubes are often called Pliicker's

tubes. The capillary part increasing the resistance greatly increases the

luminosity of the discharge. If nitrogen (or atmosphei'ic air) be intro-

duced into such a Pliicker tube, the capillary part will shine, on reduction

of pressure, with a rose-coloured light, when the ordinary discharge is

sent through it. The spectrum is one of the most beautiful which can be

Aobserved.  \cvy good coloured drawing of it is given in Pliicker and

Hittorf's paper. Accurate measurements of the bands are given by Ang-

strom and Thalen. Another drawing with measurements will be found

in Lecoq de Boisbaudran's Atlas.'

The bands of this spectrum, which are situated in the red and yellow,

present a different appearance from those which are seen in the blue and

violet. This fact has led Pliicker and Hittorf to the supposition that

we have to deal with two different spectra which are superposed only but

given out by two distinct sets of molecules. The authors tried and suc-

ceeded in separating the two spectra. By increasing the diameter of the

capillary part they obtained a tube which only showed the red and yellow

bands. Their experiment is described in the following words, which will

be found in the 28th paragTaph of the paper mentioned at the head of this

chapter :

'Thus we succeeded in constructing a tube which, when the direct

discharge was sent through it, became incandescent with the most brilliant

gold-coloured light, which might easily be confounded with the light of

highly-ignited vapours of sodium                                                                                                                                                   but with the intercalated jar,  the light
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

of the incandescent gas within the same tube, had a fine bluish- violet

colour. The yellow light when analysed by the prism, gave a beautiful

spectrum of shaded bands, extending with decreasing intensity to the

blue, the channelled spaces being scarcely perceptible. The bluish light

when examined was resolved by the prism into channelled spaces, extend-

ing towards the red ; while the former bands almost entirely disappeared.

We may transform each colour and its corresponding spectrum into the

other ah lihitmn.'

ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.  261

     Tliis experiment might not be considered to be altogether conclusive,
as a mere relative increase of intensity in the violet end by an increase
of temperature might not be considered sufficient evidence for such a
wide distinction. It was, therefore, thought better to discuss these
spectra together, and not to separate them, for there is no donbt that in
the vast majority of cases they appear as one whole and not as two dis-
tinct spectra. It might, however, be adduced in support of Pliicker and
Hittorf's opinion that the general aspect of the spectrum in the green is
certainly that of two overlapping spectra. Wiillner (' Wied. Ann.,' viii. p.
590), has described the gradual changes seen in a nitrogen tube having

a very fine capillary bore, when the pressure is gradnally reduced to a
very small amount. Owing to the increase of temperature the spectrum
gradually changes into a line spectrum, which is essentially the same as

the well-known line spectrum of nitrogen. Wiillner's results will be dis-

cussed in a separate report.

  --The Spedrum of the Negative Glow. The glow which surrounds the

negative electrode in an exhausted tube shows in many gases a spectrum,

which, as a rule, is not seen in any other part of the tube. In niti'ogen
this spectrum has often been observed since v. de Willigen first drew

attention to it, and was recently mapped by Angstroin and Thalen. It is
a channelled-space spectrum, fading away towards the blue. The bands
partially overlap some of the bands which are seen in the spectrum of the
positive discharge, so that with low dispersive powers it might seem as if
in the negative glow some of the ordinary bands were greatly increased
in intensity. But in reality a new series of bands is added at the nega-
tive pole, as will be seen with a good spectroscope, even if one prism only
be used. The ordinary spectrum of the positive discharge no doubt is
also present, though weak, in the negative glow, and often traces of the

spectrum of the negative pole are seen in the positive discharge ; but there

can be no doubt that we have to deal with two distinct spectra, although

it may not be easy to separate them entirelj^ When the pressure is much

reduced the negative glow gradually extends into the whole tube, and the
spectrum is then well seen in the capillary part.

  --Discission on the Chemical Origin of the above Spectra. Some discus-

sion has taken place on the chemical origin of the spectrum seen in the
positive discharge. In the year 1872 the writer of the present Report
('Proc. R. Soc.,' XX. p. 482), described some experiments, in which he

showed that when sodium is heated in a nitrogen tube the band spectrum

disappears, and is replaced by a series of lines which he thought belonged

to nitrogen. He drew the conclusion from his experiment that the bands

were due to an impurity of an oxide of nitrogen. It has since, however,
been shown, especially by Salet, that the disappearance of the bands is
due to another cause, and that the line spectrum which appears on heating
the sodium is not due to nitrogen. Salet also showed how, with proper

precautions, sodium may be heated in a tube containing nitrogen without

destroying the band spectrum, and he has therefore furnished the proof
that this spectrum is really due to nitrogen, and not to an oxide. Wiillner

has also come to the same conclusion. Angstrom and Thalen, however,

in their joint paper, support the opinion that the spectrum is that of
some oxide of nitrogen. They try to support this view by an experiment

showing that when the brush discharge from a Holtz machine is observed
in atmospheric air, or when the ordinaiy discharge of a coil is sent through
rarefied air, the band spectrum is seen, and that at the same time the

formation o£ nitrogen dioxide can be proved by means of a solution of sul-

phate of iron. But the reasoning proves too much ; for oxides of nitrogen
are also formed under the influence of the jar discharge when the line
spectrum is visible, and we should, therefore, have an equal right to

assume that the line spectrum of nitrogen is due to an oxide. It is im-
portant to remark that the chemical compounds which are formed outside
the sjjark give us no information on the chemical origin of the spectrum
which is given by the spark itself. In the absence of any contradictory
proof, Salet's experiment that the band spectrum of nitrogen is seen in a
tube in which sodium is heated to its fusing point must be considered
conclusive that the spectrum is not due to an oxide.

The spectrum seen when a weak spark is taken in a current of am-

monia is neither that of nitrogen nor that of hydrogen, but must be due

to a compound of these two gases. The writer of this report could even

obtain a spectrum in a vacuum tube by maintaining a current of the gas

through the tube. The spectrum consisted of a single band in the

greenish yellow, standing on a faint continuous background. The wave-

length was approximately found to be 5686 to 5627 decimetres. If am-

monia and hydrogen are burnt together, either in air or in oxygen, a

complicated spectrum is obtained, the chemical origin of which has not

been satisfactorily explained as yet. Drawings of this sjiectrum are given

by Dibbits and Hofinann.

yet been found which can be with certainty referred to a compound of

distinguish four spectra of oxygen.

  --The Elementary Line-spectrum of Oxygen. This is the spectrum

which appears at the highest temperature to which we can subject oxygen
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

that is, whenever the jar and aii'-break are introduced into the electric

circuit. It consists of a great number of lines, especially in the more

refrangible part of the spectrum. It has been called elementary line-

spectrum to distinguish it fi-om the other line-spectrum, because, accord-

ing to one hypothesis, which has been suggested, to explain the variability

of spectra, the molecule which gives this spectrum is in a simpler or more

elementary state than that which gives the other or so-called compound
Weline-spectrum.
                  may, however, adopt the nomenclature independently

of any hypothesis which may have suggested it.

   --The Compound Line-spectrum of Oxygen. This spectrum appears at

lower temperatures than the first. It consists of four lines : one in the

red, two in the green, and one in the blue. With the exception of the

blue line, all the lines in this spectrum widen very easily, and with an

increase of pressure, more easily even than the hydrogen lines. They do

not widen out equally on both sides, but more towards the red than

towards the violet. This fact is especially noticeable in the more re-

frangible of the two green lines. The blue line always remains sharp,

   --The Continuous S-pedrum of Oxygen. This spectrum appears at the

lowest temperature at which oxygen is luminous. The wide part of a-

Pliicker tube, filled with pure oxygen, generally shines with a faint yellow

light, which gives a continuous spectrum. Even at atmospheric pressure

this continuous spectrum can be obtained by putting the contact breaker

of the induction coil out of adjustment, so that the spark is weakened.

According to Becquerel an excess of oxygen in the oxyhydrogen flame

produces a yellow colour, which colour very likely is due to this continuous

spectrum of oxygen. The contiuuous background which often accom-

panies the elementary line-spectrum must not be confounded with thisr

spectrum.

  --The Spectrum of the Negatire Glov;. This spectrum, which was first

accura,tely described by Wiillner (1872), is always seen in the glow sur-
rounding the negative electrode in oxygen. It consists of five bands

three in the red and two in the green. The least refrangible of the red
bands is so weak that it easily escapes obser\-ation ; the two other red

bands are rather near together, and may be taken for one single band if

the dispersion applied is small. The two green bands, which appear of

  --Transformation of Spectra into each other. The following description

of the appearance of a vacuum-tube filled with pure oxygen, as it under-

goes gradual exhaustion, will give an idea of the way in which the spectra

--of oxygen gradually diffuse into each other :

capillary part above the continuous spectrum. One of these lines is in the

red, two are in the green, and one is in the blue. The discharge still

passes as a narrow spark throughout the length of the tube. In the

wide part the spectrum remains continuous, and it extends more towards

the red and blue than in the capillary part. It seems as if the four lines

had taken away part of the energy of the continuous spectrum. As

the pressure diminishes, these lines increase considerably in strength, the

spark spreads out in the wide part of the tube, and the intensity of the

continuous spectrum is, therefore, considerably diminished, Avhile it still

forms a prominent part in the spectrum of the capillary part. When the

pressure is small the continuous spectrum decreases in intensity. At
the same time the negative glow, with its own characteristic spectrum,

gradually extends through the negative half of the tube into the capil-

lary part. The continuous spectrum has now entirely disappeared ; the

bands of the negative pole and the four lines stand out on a perfectly

black background. It is under these conditions that the change from the

compound line-spectrum to the elementary line-spectrum is best studied.

The mere insertion of theLeyden jar, I find, makes hardly any difference;

the jar does not seem to be charged at all. If, in addition to the jar, we

insert a movable air-break, which can be opened or closed at will, while

we look through the spectroscope, we shall be able to see alternately two

perfectly distinct spectra. If the air-break is closed, the four lines of the

compound spectrum only are seen ; if the air-break is opened these four

lines will disappear entirely, and the elementary line-spectrum will come

Weout.  have here as complete a transformation as we have from the

band to the line spectrum of nitrogen, taking place under exactly the

Wesame circumstances.  have, therefore, the same right to consider the

two-line spectra of oxygen as two distinct spectra as we have in the case

--of the two spectra of nitrogen.'
     Chemical Origin of Spectra. There can be no doubfc that all the above

spectra really belong to oxygen. They appear iu whatever way the oxygen

has been prepared. They are seen with electrodes of aluminium, platinum,

silver, brass, and iridium. The glass also could not have introduced any

appreciable impurity, for all the spectra were observed in a large glass

receiver in which no part of the spark was within two and-a-half inches

from the glass.

It has been observed already that great caution is necessary to exclude

all carbon impurities, and the reader is warned that several descriptions of

the carbonic oxide spectrum as a supposed oxygen spectrum have even

recently appeared.^

Few spectra have given rise to so much controversy as the spectrum

Weof carbon.  shall give an account of the most important experiments

which have been made on the subject.

  --The Line-spectrum. This spectrum appears when a very strong spark

is sent through carbonic oxide or carbonic acid. It has been observed and

described by Watts, Wiillner, Angstrom and Thalen. The best measure-

ments seem to be given by the two Swedish observers. Watts gives many

lines which are not found in Angstrom and Thalen's map, but it seems
possible that the separation of carbon and oxygen lines has only been
imperfectly effected by Watts. All observers seem agreed in ascribing
this spectrum to carbon. Though Huggins and Watts wei'e only able to

obtain this spectrum from carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, Angstrom and
Thalen seem to have seen it also in hydrocarbons when they used a large

condenser.

  --2. The Band-spectrum {Candle-spectrum) This is the spectrum which

is observed at the base of every candle and gas flame. The controversy

on the carbon spectrum chiefly relates to this spectrum, there being a

disagreement of opinion whether it is due to the element carbon or to a

hj-drocarbon. The spectrum which has first been described by Swan

consists of a series of bands apparently fading away towards the blue, but

Ain reality easily resolvable into a series of lines.  good idea of the

appearance of this spectrum as it appears in spectroscopes of one prism,

is obtained from the drawing given in Lecoq de Boisbaudi'an's Atlas.

Angstrom and Thalen and Watts give more detailed drawings and
measurements. The spectrum was considered by Swan to be due to a
hydrocarbon, but Swan's experiments were only made with gases

containing hydrogen. Attfield discussed the question at great length in

1862, and came to the conclusion, that the spectrum was really due to
carbon. The experiments which were considered crucial by Attfield and
the great majority of observers were as follows :

    A1. flame of cyanogen in oxygen shows, amongst other bands, this

spectrum most hrillianthj, after both gases have been carefully dried.
Cyanogen burning in air also gives the spectrum, but more faintly.

     2. Sparks taken in the following gases, at atmospheric pressure,
carefally prepared and dried, show the spectrum.

     Cyanogen.

      Carbonic oxide.

     Carbon bisulphide.
     These gases have only carbon in common, and, unless the experiments
are vitiated by impurities, they prove undoubtedly that the spectrum is due
to the element carbon.
266 itEPOBT-- 1880.

     Mr. Atfcfielil's paper induced Morren to take up the question. Starting
with the intention of disproving Attfield's conclusions he ended by being

convinced that he was right. Entirely confirming Attfield's experiments
Morren satisfied himself that the candle spectrum was really due to carbon,

and not to a hydrocarbon. He especially testifies to the brilliancy of the

spectrum in a flame of cyanogen and oxygen.

    Dibbits had already, before Morren, arrived at the same conclusion. He

was the first to furnish an answer to the theoretical objection which can
be raised against Attfield's explanation, and which at first sight appears
serious. The temperature of an ordinary flame is certainly not high
enough to volatilise carbon. How, then, can carbon be present in the state

of vapour and give us a discontinuous spectrum. Dibbits explains the

difficulty by saying that carbon exists before combustion, combined with

hydrogen ; after combustion it is combined with oxygen, and it must

therefore have existed during a certain stage of transition in the form of

simple carbon uncombined. During this stage of transition it gives us the

carbon spectrum. He sujjports the explanation by the fact that a flame

of carbonic oxide does not show the spectrum, because in it the carbon is

never in a free and uncombined state. Dibbits' view has received a good

deal of support by some very interesting experiments made recently by

Gouy (' C. R.' Ixxxiv. p. 231). In a Bunsen flame, the spectrum under

discussion  is  confined to  a  naii'ow  cone                          Gouy charges  the air before  it
                                                                    ;

enters the burner with powdered salts in a finely divided state, and shows

that at the same place where the candle-spectrum appears we may obtain

the spectra of bodies which it would be impossible to volatilise in the flame.

Thus the salts of iron, cobalt, manganese, silver, give lines which we know

to be due to these metals, as they are found in their spectra obtained

by means of electric sparks. Even platinum salts give a spectrum in the
blue cone, but it is not certain that this spectrum is really due to platinum
in an uncombined state. Gouy believes that these experiments indicate a
very high temperature in the blue cone of a Bunsen flame, but we think
an explanation, identical with the one given by Dibbits for carbon, will be
found more plausible. V. de Willigen had already, before Attfield, made
some not quite satisfactory experiments tending to show that the candle-
spectrum is due to carbon. Pliicker and Hittorf, as well as Wiillner, arrive
(after Attfield) at the same conclusion. Watts has made a long series of

experiments, all tending to support Attfield's view. In addition to the
gases experimented on by Attfield he took carbonic tetrachloride and
obtained from it the candle-spectrum. Lockyer has quite recently

experimented with the same gas and shown that this much discussed
spectrum can be obtained, when a strong spark does not reveal the
presence of hydrogen. Huggins' attention was drawn to this spectrum

through his observations on comets, and he also obtained the candle-

spectrum in a current of cyanogen gas, and therefore considered the

spectrum to be due to carbon.

    On the whole it may be said that, from the publication of Attfield's

paper until the year 1875, every spectroscopist, whether he was a chemist
or a physicist, who had set to work to decide the question, came to the
conclusion that the candle-spectrum was a true spectrum of carbon, and

the question appeared to be settled. In the year 1875, after Angstrom's
death, Thalen published a paper in which he describes some experiments

jointly made with Angstrom. In consequence of these experiments the
                                                        ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.                                                                                    267

   authors expressed the opinion that the candle-spectrnm was due to a hydi'O-
   carbon. The experiments wliich they gave in support of their view were
   made by taking the spark of carbon electrodes in various gases and
   examining the spectra of the ' aureole ' ' or ' glory,' as it might be called.

   If the spark is taken in oxygen the undoubted spectrum of carbonic oxide

   appears                                              in hydrogen the candle-spectrum                                                              is seen ;   and in nitrogen  some
                                                     ;

   blue and violet bands are added to the candle-spectrum which appear to

   be due to a compound of carbon and nitrogen. As it is known that

   acetylene is formed when the spark is taken in hydrogen, Angstrom and

   Thaleu conclude that the spectrum seen in the ' glory ' is due to

   acetylene.

       Recently Professors Liveing and Dewar have supported Angstrom's
   view. The following quotations from their paper will give an idea

   --of the view taken up by the two Cambridge professors :

        ' Our faith in the conclusions of Angstrom and Thalen on this subject
   has been much strengthened by our own observations, which we now pro-

   ceed to describe ' (p. 154).
        Their experiments consisted in observing the spectra seen in the electric

   arc passing between carbon poles in various gases, such as air, carbonic
   acid, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, carbonic oxide, nitric oxide, and am-

   monia. They also examined some flames of carbon compounds. The

   following is their summary of that jsart of their work which relates to the

   candle-spectrum :

        ' In the next place, the green and blue bands, characteristic of the

   hydrocarbon flame, are well seen when the arc is taken in hydrogen ; but
   though less strong when the arc is taken in nitrogen or in chlorine, they

   seem to be always present in the arc whatever the atmosphere. This is

   what we should expect, if they be due, as Angstrom and Thalen suppose,

   to acetylene ; for we have found that the carbon electrodes always contain,
   even when they have been long treated in chlorine, a notable quantity of

   hydrogen.

   ' In the flames of carbon compounds they by no means always appear

   indeed it is only in those of hydrocarbons or their derivatives that they

   are w^ell seen. Carbonic oxide and carbon disiilphide, even when mixed

   with hydrogen,                                       do  not show them                                                                       and if seen in the  flames of cyanogen,
                                                                                                                                             ;

   hydrocyanic aeid, and carbon tetrachloride mixed with hydrogen, they

   are faint, and do not form a principal or prominent part of the spec-

   trum. This is all consistent with the supposition of Angstrom and

   Thalen.'

       The experiment, noticed above, on carbon tetrachloride was made by

   Lockyer in answer to Professors Liveing and Dewar's paper.

   To recapitulate shortly the arguments on either side : Those who

   believe the spectrum to be due to the element carbon rely chieflj- on the

   brilliancy with which these bands are developed when cyanogen is burnt in

   oxygen, also when the spark is taken in cyanogen, carbon tetrachloride,

   and carbonic oxide at high                               pressure                                                                            all  the  gases  being  dried  with the
                                                                                                                  ;

   greatest care. Those who oppose this view and who hold that the spec-

   trum is due to a hydrocarbon, refer to the impossibility of excluding all

spicuous bands. According to Angstrom and Thalen they are : 5633"0

     Compounds of Carhmi and Nitrogen. The flame of cyanogen, which
had already been examined by Faraday and Draper, before the days of

Spectrum Analysis, shows a series of bands in the red, reaching into the

green, which are not seen in any other flame. Pliicker and Dibbits have

given drawings of these bands, which have their sharp edge on the most
refrangible side. There is no doubt that they are due to a compound of
carbon and nitrogen. The same bands are also seen, when cyanogen is

burnt in oxygen, although, according to Morren and Watts, they are less

developed, a fact which they ascribe to the smaller quantity of undecom-

posed cyanogen at the higher temperature of the flame in oxygen. Ac-

cording to Pliicker and Hittorf, and also Dibbits, the bands in the red
become more brilliant when cyanogen is burnt in oxygen. There seems

to be a conflict between the increased brilliancy due to a higher tempera-
ture and the decrease of luminosity due to the more rapid decomposition

in the oxygen flame.

Besides the red and yellow bands, a cyanogen flame shows a series

of bands in the blue, violet, and ultra-violet. These bands have been,

until quite recently, ascribed to carbon, as they have also been observed in

carbon compounds not containing nitrogen, but according to the experi-

ments of Professors Liveing and Dewar, they can in those cases always

be traced to impurities containing nitrogen.

    Thus, according to Watts, the bands are seen when a spark is taken

in carbonic oride at the atmospheric pressure. According to Professors

Liveing and Dewar this is true, if the carbonic oxide has been prepared

from ferrocyanide of potassium. When the gas, however, was made by

the action of sulphuric acid on dried formiate of sodium, a faint trace of

one of the bands only could be detected. When the gas was pi'epared

by heating a mixture of quicklime with pure and dry potassium oxalate,

no trace whatever of the bands in question appeared.

     Similarly Watts and Lockyer had observed the bands in a tube con-
taining- carbon tetrachloride, but, according to Professors Liveing and
Dewar, these bands do not appear when the tetrachloride has been well

purified, and when all traces of air have been expelled from the tube.

     Experiments with naphthalene gave the same results ; the bands did

not appear when the air had been properly expelled from the tube.

Tlaese experiments seem conclusive as to the chemical origin of the

spectrum in question. It seems remarkable, however, that this spectrum

should be reversed in the solar spectrum ; for a photograph taken by

Lockyer shows a decided coincidence of one of the flutings with a series

of dark lines in the solar  spectrum                                              and  Professors  Liveing  and  Dewar
                                                                               ;

consider the reversal of another set of flutings still further in the ultra-

violet as probable. The spectrum we have been discussing consists chiefly

of three sets of bands ; the first set consists of seven fluted bands (wave-

lengths 4600 to 4502, Watts), the second set of six bands (\=4220 to

=4158, Watts), and the third set in the ultra-violet of five bands (X 3883-5

to 3850, Liveing and Dewar). According to Professors Liveing and

--coinciding with the solar line P.
     Spectmm of Carbonic Oxide. It has been said already that great care
must be taken, in order to produce a spectrum of oxygen, to exclude all

carbon impurities. If this precaution is not taken a spectrum is obtained
which no doubt belongs to carbonic oxide. The spectrum is most bril-
liantly obtained in a Pliicker's tube filled with carbonic oxide. The spec-
trum was carefully examined by Wiillner, and was measured by Watts as

well as Angstrom and Thalen. As some of the bands are situated rather

near to the bands of the candle-spectrum, the two spectra have often been

confounded, and we therefore give the wave-lengths obtained by the

Swedish   observers for the most  conspicuous  bands:  5607-5                                  5197-0;
                                                                                            ;

4833-0.

  -- mSpectrum of Carbonic Acid. Pliicker mentions already his first paper

on the spectra of gases (1858) that carbonic acid in a vacuum-tube shows
a baud in the red which is very strong at first and gradually disappears.
This band he attributes to carbonic acid (1859), which, it is known, is
gradually decomposed by the spark. Wiillner has carefully examined
and described the changes going on in the spectrum seen in a vacuum-tube

when it is first filled with carbonic acid.
     Professor Piazzi Smyth (' Phil. Mag.' xlix. p. "24) has given some very

careful and valuable measurements of the details in some of the flutings

of the spectra which we have described. He ascribes the candle spec-
trum to a hydrocarbon, and the spectrum which we have put down as

belonging to carbonic oxide, he refers to carbon, as it is also visible in

tubes not containing any oxygen. Professor Piazzi Smyth has, however,
not filled his own tubes, and we must be careful not to attach too much
value to the labels put on vacuum tubes by the glass-blower who has

filled them. According to Watts, a tube containing hydrocarbons does

not show this spectrum when the gas is heated in contact with metalHc

sodium.'

   --The Line-spectrum. This is the spectrum which is obtained if an

electric spark is taken in chlorine gas. It has been mapped by Pliicker

and Hittorf, whose measurements have been reduced to wave-lengths by

Watts. Some earlier measurements of the strongest lines will be found

in Pliicker's paper. Salet has also mapped this chlorine spectrum as well
Aas could be done with a spectroscope of small dispersive powers.

of the lines have been measured by Angstrom (' Phil. Mag.' xlii. p. 398),

None of these measurements lay claim to great accuracy. Recently
Ciamician has given a detailed account of the successive changes which

this spectrum undergoes, if the pressure is either greatly reduced or

increased. Lines, Avhich are visible at one pressure, altogether disappear

at another. Some preliminary experiments have convinced the writer of
this report, that we have here to deal with a mixture of several overlap-
ping spectra. In reality the phenomena are even more complicated than
Ciamician supposes, but a more extensive series of experiments is required
before any detailed account can be given.

   --The Band-spectrum. This is the spectrum Avhich is obtained by ab-

sorption, if sunlight is sent through a long column of chlorine gas. The
spectrum was first observed by Morren, who describes it, but does not give

--any measurements. It has never been obtained as an emission spectrum.
     Compounds of CJdorine and Oxijgen. The absorption spectra of chlorine

trioxide and chlorine peroxide were examined by Prof. "W. A. Miller in
184-5 and found to be identical, while chlorine monoxide did not show

any bands. As no other case is known in which two different compounds

give the same spectrum, and as the oxides of chlorine are very unstable,
there is no doubt that the spectrum of one of them only was observed,
that gas to which the spectrum belongs being also present when the other
oxide was examined. Gernez confirming Miller's results, also found that
a weak solution of these gases in some liquids presents the same absorption
bands. According to Gernez a long tube filled with chlorine monoxide

shows the same spectrum. A drawing of the spectrum will be found in

Miller's paper.

    Drawings and measurements have been made by Roscoe and Thorpe
and Moser, who mentions some changes which the spectrum shows on

being heated. The most detailed and apparently the best drawings ai-e

given by Dr. B. Hasselberg. Both Moser and Hasselberg's measurements

begin in the orange, so that for absorption-bands in the red we have to

refer to Roscoe and Thorpe's map.

   A flame of hydrogen containing bromine gives a continuous spectrum

only._ Similarly, if a hard glass tube is heated to a low red heat and

bromine introduced, the gas becomes luminous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    but a continuous spectrum

to the bands of the absorption spectrum widened by an increase of

temperature, or whether we have to deal with a true continuous spectrum.

In the latter case we should have the remarkable fact of a vapour giving a

continuous spectrum at a higher temperature than the one at which it
gives the band spectrum.

--The Line-spectrum. -This spectrum, which appears under the same

circumstances as the line-spectra of chlorine and bromine, has been mapped

by the same observers. Ciamician found in this spectrum similar changes

as when the pressure was greatly reduced.

  --The Band-specfrum. This spectrum, which is easily obtained as an

absorption-spectrum at low temperatures, was first observed by Prof.

W. H. Miller, 1833. It has been carefully mapped by Thalen. The

darkening and widening of the bands when the temperature is increased

has been described by Thalen and Lockyer. It is a curious fact that the

absorption on heating extends continuously into the blue and violet (which

are clear at low temperature) so that the whole of the mare refrangible

end of the spectrum can be blocked out. At higher temperatures, however,

the violet and blue light is transmitted, and the spectrum resembles again

that of low temperature. Thus Lockyer heating various vapours in an

iron tube placed inside a furnace, supplied with coke or chai'coal, found

that iodine gave an intense bank of general absorption in the violet, where

at the ordinary temperature the vapour transmits light. In his joint
experiments with Mr. Chandler Roberts, in which the vapours were heated
to a still higher degree he found that the violet and blue light was trans-
mitted again.

     Salet could obtain this spectrum as an emission spectrum in the wide
part of a Geissler tube. Also by heating the vapour of iodine round a
Avhite-hot platinum spiral.

     Wiillner, however, was the first to observe this spectrum as an emission
.spectrum by charging a hydrogen flame with iodine vapour.

     Angstrom had already examined the spectrum of an alcohol flame
containing iodine, but had obtained a difi'erent spectrum, showing bands

in the green. According to Mitcherlich the latter spectrum is obtained if
a flame of hydrogen contains small quantities of iodine. If large quantities

are present the reversal of the absorption spectrum is seen. Salet did not

observe this spectrum ; but the one mentioned by Angstriun and Mitcherlich,
which very likely is that of some compound of iodine.

   --Spectrum of Iodine Chloride. The absorption si^ectrum of the vapour

of iodine chloride was observed by Gernez (' C. R.' Ixxiv. p. 660) and

mapped by Roscoe and Thorpe, who drew attention to the resemblance of

this spectrum to that of bromine. ('Phil. Trans.' clxvii. p. 207.)
272 KEPOET-- 1880.

     The vapour of frotobromide of iodine also gives an absorption spectrum

--similar to the above (Gernez : ' C. R.' Ixxiv. p. 1190 1874).

     Salet : ' Ann. Chim. Phys.' xxviii. p. 34. (1873).

    A spark taken in fluoride of silicium shows a few lines, which are not

seen when the spark is taken in chloride of silicium. These lines Salet
attributes to the element fluorine ; they are all situated in the red. Seguin
observed a strong blue ray common to fluoride of silicium and fluoride of
boron, and attributes it to fluorine. Seguin does not say in what way the

gases were prepared, but it seems jjossible that the blue line is the calcium

line, which very often appears when calcium compounds are used in

preparing gases.

  --The Line-S2)ectrum. If sulphur is heated to its point of ebullition in

a vacuum-tube, and the jar discharge passed through the vapour, we
obtain a line-spectrum, which was first measured by Pliicker and Hittorf
(Watts, Index of Spectra). Salet also has mapped this spectrum, and a

few of the lines have been measured by Angstrom (' Phil. Mag.' xlii. p. 397).
Seguin has obtained this spectrum by heating sulphur in hydrogen and

passing a spark at atmospheric pressure through the hydrogen. He was

thus the first to observe this spectrum.

   --The Band-spedrum. If the ordinary discharge is passed through a

vacuum-tube, in which sulphur is kept boiling, a beautiful band-spectrum
is obtained. Pliicker and Hittorf give a coloured drawing of this spec-
trum, but without measurements. Measurements have been supplied by

Salet, who furnishes us with the best investigation on sulphur spectra
which we at present possess. He was the first to observe this spectrum

as an absorption spectrum, by passing the light through sulphur vapour
heated to a high temperature, an observation which has been confirmed
by Gernez and Lockyer.

     The flame of sulphur, as weU as the flame of sulphuretted hydrogen,

gives a continuous spectrum only, but if a hydrogen flame contains traces
of sulphur a band- spectrum is seen. This spectrum was first obtained
by Mulder by heating sulphur near the orifice of a glass tube through
which hydrogen passed, the hydrogen being burnt at the orifice. Salet
increased the luminosity of the flame by pressing it against a layer of
cold water falling vertically. According to him the band-spectrum thus
obtained is the same as the one seen in a vacuum-tube ; the relative
intensity of some of the bands only being altered. Considering, how-
ever, the small dispersion used by Salet and the large differences between

the two spectra shown in his map, it seems probable that we have to deal,
in part, at any rate, with a new spectrum, most likely that of a compound.

Some of the bands of the electric spectram no doubt may be present as

well.

  --The Goniinuous Spectrum of Sul^liur. Sulphur vapour at compara-

tively low tempei'atures shows a continuous spectrum by absorption.
The change of this continuous spectrum to the band-spectrum seems to
be connected with and dependent on the change in density which sulphur
vapour undergoes between the temperatures of 500° and 1000°. Gernez
at least mentions that the change takes place simultaneously with a rapid

decrease in density.

The spectra of selenium are analogous to those of sulphur, and are

obtained in the same way. Accoi'ding to Salet the band- spectrum may

be obtained in the flame of burning selenium, or when the metalloid is
heated in a hydrogen flame (Mulder). Sulphur, as we have observed,

gives under the same conditions a continuous spectrum only. The band-

spectrum of selenium has been obtained by absorption in selenium vapour
by Gernez. At 700°, according to this observer, the vapour of selenium

absorbs all the light with the exception of the red but if the temperature
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

is raised the tint of the vapour brightens, and the different I'egions of the

spectrum re-appear, furrowed with groups of black bands in the blue
and violet. The band-spectrum has also been obtained by Lockyer as an

absorption spectrum.

Gernez also describes the absorption spectra shown by the vapours of

selenious  acid, protochloride  of  selenium, and  bromide of  selenium                                           but

he does not give any measurements.

     Salet: ' Ann. Chim. Phys.' xxviii. p. 49 (1872).
      Gernez : ' C. R.' Ixxiv. p. 1190 (1872).

     The Une-spedrum of tellurium can be obtained, like that of metals, by
taking the jar discharge from tellurium poles in air. It has been mea-
sured by Thalen. Salet has observed a band-spectrum in vacuum-tubes
in which tellurium was heated, but he could not decide whether this
spectrum did not rather belong to an oxide. Gernez heated tellurium in
an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas to a temperature near that at which
glass begins to melt, and he observed in the transmitted light an absorp-
tion spectrum, extending from the yellow into the violet.

     Protochloride of tellurium, according to the same observer, gives a band-
absorption spectrum, chiefly in the orange and green. The vapour of
protobromide of tellurium absorbs the light in the red and yellow.

    By passing a spark in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure in which

phosphorus was heated, Seguin observed a line- spectrum. Pliicker and
Hittorf and Salet observed the same spectrum by treating phosphorus in
a vacuum-tube like selenium. The spectrum consists of comparatively
few lines, which are chiefly situated in the orange and green.

   A hydrogen flame containing traces of phosphorus takes a green

colour, and shows a spectrum which was first drawn by Christofle and
Beilstein. Mulder makes the interesting remark that a drop of ether in

the hydrogen apparatus altogether prevents the formation of this spec-

trnm. He tries to explain the fact by assuming that the ether prevents

the oxidation of the phosphorus.

     Salet rendered the green flame more luminous by cooling it. The
most successful way of effecting this seems to be to surround the tube,
through which the hydrogen escapes, by a wider tube, and to blow cold

air through this wider tube. This cooling produces a change in the
relative intensity of the bands, the red and yellow bands being strength-
ened. Lecoq de Boisbaudran gives a careful drawing of this spectrum

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

which very likely is due to some compound of phosphorus.

A spectrum of silicon may be obtained by taking the jar discharge

iDetween poles of silicon. Kirchhoff has thus mapped two bands, one of

which, however, according to Salet, is due to lead. Troost and Haute-

feuille mention that they have obtained in this way a great number of
lines, but their measurements are all given to an arbitrary scale. By
passing a spark through the chloride and fluoride of silicon we can

eliminate the lines due to the halogens, and obtain a spectrum of lines

which must be due to silicon. This has been done by Salet. Salet has

also obtained spectra of the hydrogen flame charged with chloride, bro-

mide, and iodide of silicon. Most of the bands observed are common to

all three compounds, but whether they are due to silicon or to a compound

with oxygen or hydrogen is uncertain. Pliicker observed in a vacuum-

tube filled with chloride of silicon a band-spectrum, which very likely is

due to that compound. Silicon fluoride also gives a band-spectrum under

the same conditions. Bromide of silicon, according to Salet, gives a con-

tinuous spectrum in a vacuum-tube, when a weak spark is passed through

Ait. strong spark decomposes the gas, and the lines of bromine and

silicon appear.

                 XIV. Boron.

     Troost et Hautefeuille : ' C. R.' ixxiii. p. 620 (1871).

     The spectrum of boron was obtained by Messrs. Troost et Hautefeuille
by comparing together the spectra obtained between platinum poles in
atmospheres of fluoride of boron and fluoride of silicon. . It consists of
several groups of brilliant double lines in the yellow, green, and blue.

§ 2. On the Influence of Teju'Eratuke and Pressure on the Spectra
                         OF Gases. By Dr. Schuster, F.B.S.

A study of the changes which may be observed in the spectra of gases,

under varying circumstances, is of great importance, both from a practical
Weand a theoretical point of view.
                                                                                                are here chiefly concerned with the

practical side                                                            and it is clear that a full investigation of  all  spectroscopic
                                                                       ;

variations attending changes of physical conditions, will ultimately lead to

a science which will aim, not only at a merely qualitative analysis, as the

original spectroscopy did, but which will enable us to determine the exact

physical state of a luminous body, at whatever distance from us that body

might be placed.

There is some difficulty in arranging the great quantity of partially

Weunconnected facts which we shall have to place before the reader.

shall endeavour, for clearness' sake, to arrange our material under five
Wedifiereut heads.
                                                                          shall first discuss what changes we have a right to

expect in the appearance of a spectrum, if the quantity of luminous

matter is increased, or if the temperature is raised, the absorbing pro-

Weperties of the gas remaining unaltered.                                                                    shall next speak of the

widening of lines, which, as we shall see, often accompanies an increase

of pressure. Then we shall treat of the different spectra given by one

and the same body at different temperatures, and we shall see how far

satisfactory explanations have been offered for their existence.

So far our road will be clear, but we shall find that these spectra of

different orders, as they have been called, are only extreme cases of con-

tinuous changes which are nearly always going on. Very often we can

refer these continuous changes to a gradual displacement of one spectrum

by another                                            but                 often we  shall  not  be  able to  prove  the  existence  of  a
                                                   ;

second spectrum. There is, a priori, nothing impossible, or even improb-

able, in the view that the relative intensity of different lines may be

different at different temperatures, and often when we observe a variation,
we may equally well explain it by assuming the gradual appearance of a
new spectrum, or an alteration only in the relative intensities of the lines.

It becomes then a matter of extreme difficulty to decide which of the

two suppositions is correct. In doubtful cases we may often be able to

obtain important information by means of a method which is little under-

stood, even by spectroscopists. It is the method which has first been

extensively used and investigated by Mr. Lockyer, of projecting an image

of the luminous source, spark, arc, or flame on the slit of the spectroscope,
and thus localising the spectra which are thrown and confused together^

Weif the luminous source is examined directly without the interposition of a
lens.  shall see how, by means of this method, we shall often at a

single glance be able to tell how the body will behave at different tem-

peratures and under different pressures. Many facts which have been

quoted as remarkable might have been ft>retold by means of this method.

Our fourth chapter will be devoted to it. In our last chapter we shall

have to give an account of some changes which have not found a place

under the pi'evious heads.

    I. Influence of Thickness of Radiating Lmjer on the Spectra of Gases.

     Let a be the coefficient of absorption for a certain wave-length of a
layer of gas, of thickness and density equal to unity. Let e be the

                                                                 T2

radiation of a perfectly black body for tbe given wave-lengtb, and at the

temperature of tbe body, tbe radiation of which we are considering.

--Then the radiation E of a layer of thickness a and density c will be^

                      E = [i-(i-.)"']

    We pass over some obvious consequences of this formula, which have

been treated in detail in Zollner's paper, but shall discuss whether a mere

increase in the thickness or density of the layer can alter the relative

=intensities of the lines. Put dS a and let E, be the radiation of the

same body for another wave-length, e^ being the corresponding radiation
for a perfectly black body.

     In the first place we remark that there can only be one finite value of
cr, for which the two radiations can be equal ; for the equation

                 [l-(l-,0'^]e = [l-(l-«,)^]

=has only two roots, one of them being (t oi, which case, of course, is

excluded from our consideration. For an infinite thickness

                                           El _e,
                                        E e'

Let fii be larger than e ; then, if for any given value of <t, say <t', E, is
larger than E, it must be also larger for all greater values of t, for if for
any value larger than o-', E, could be smaller, it would have to be equal

= =to E for two values lying between o- andff' o- oo ; which, as we have

seen, is impossible. On the other hand, if, for any value of cr, Ej is

smaller than E, the relative intensities must be reversed by an increase

of thickness, for an infinite value of ff will make E, > E.

   We have been assuming that gj is larger than e ; e being the radiation

of a perfectly black body. Now for all temperatures which we are con-

sidering, the radiation of a perfectly black body decreases in the visible
part of the spectrum with the wave-length. Hence the wave-length, for
which El is the radiation, must be larger than the corresponding wave-
length for E. Putting all these considerations together we arrive at the
following laws :

      1. If the less refrangible of two rays is the stronrjer for any given quantity
of luviinoiis matter, no increase of that quantity can reverse the relative

intensities, hut a decrease may render the more refranqihle ray stronger.

     2. If the more refrangible of two rays is the stronger, a sufficient in-
crease in the quantity of luminous matter ivill, in all cases, reverse the
relative intensities, but a decrease luill never make the less refrangible ray

stronger.

     Zollner, who was the first to draw attention to the fact that a reversal
of relative intensity may be produced by an increase in the quantity of

luminous matter, has failed to notice that this inversion can only take
place if the less refrangible ray is the weaker of the two.

    When we come to look round for examples in which the effect of

thickness of a layer can be clearly traced, we shall have difficulty in
finding any. For most gases the values of » are exceedingly small,
and then, of course, the increase of quantity must be exaggerated to an
enormous extent before any appreciable effect is produced. Even on the

sun, the relative intensities of the lines is often the same as that we

observe in our laboratory experiments, and where it is not, it does not
show such changes as would be produced by a mere increase of the
absorbing layer. In liquids, of course, and some vapours which have
large absorbing powers, an effect of the thickness of the absorbing layer

can be traced.
      If the temperature of a radiating gas is increased, the absorbing

power for each ray remaining the same, the radiation will vai'y in the
same proportion as e ; that is, as the radiation from a perfectly black body.
It follows that the more refrangible rays will relatively gain more- than
the less refrangible rays, but it must be boi'ne in mind that the absolute
intensity of any given line can never decrease, unless the quantity of
luminous matter decreases.

II. Widening of Lines.

In his celebrated paper, ' Optiska Undersokningar ' ' (1853,) Angstrom

gives two drawings of the hydrogen spectrum. In neither of them are

the lines sharp ; but in one of them especially they are drawn out into

broad bands. The property of widening their lines under certain circum-

stances has since been found to be common to all bodies, though some of

them possess it to a much larger extent than others. Hydrogen and

sodium are the best known instances of elements which widen their lines

considerably, though in one of the spectra of oxygen, the lines broaden

even more easily. Wiillner ^ has given a detailed description of the

behaviour of the hydrogen lines under different pressures, both with the

condensed and uncondensed discharge. The same author has also given

us information as to the widening of some of the oxygen lines in the same

paper, and his observations were confirmed and extended by the author

of this report.^ Ciamician '' has described the widening of the lines ol

mercury, sodium, and some other gases. The papers of Lockyer, and of

Liveing and Dewar will also be found to contain many observations on.

Wethe widening of lines.     shall refer presently to some of their most

important experiments on the subject.

It is a fact which is often, though by no means generally, true, that if

a spectrum widens its lines easily, the widening begins with the most

refrangible lines. This was first noticed by Plticker and Hittorf in the

case of hydrogen. They express themselves as follows : '
     ' Hydrogen shows in the most striking way the expansion of its

spectral lines and their gradual transformation into a continuous spectrum.

By increasing the power of the coil, Hy (coincident with solar line near G)

first expands, then H/3 (solar F). Let the aperture of the slit be so regu-

lated that the double sodium line will separate into two lines, nearly

touching ; then the angular breadth of H/3 becoming two or three

Hyminutes,*' the breadth of  is about double.  Ha remains almost un-

changed after Hy has passed into an undetermined hazy band, and H/3

Aextended its decreasing light on its two sides.'  fourth hydrogen line,

more refrangible than the others, was discovered by Angstrom, and as

Goldstein "^ has remarked, this line is the first to widen, thus followine

the general rule. It would be interesting to determine the behaviour of

the ultra-violet lines of hydrogen which have recently been discovered.

In the case of oxygen, Plucker and Hittorf have remarked that the

less refrangible lines widen most easily. But Plucker and Hittorf did

not separate the two line-spectra of oxygen. (See Report on Spectra of

Metalloids.) The lines belonging to the lower temperature widen more

easily perhaps than any other lines, with the exception of the blue line,

which always remains sharp, and presents a striking contrast to the other

lines. The two green lines belonging to this spectrum widen more easily

than the red line ; so that the lines which do expand follow the rule.
The lines of the other line spectrum do not expand very much, though

their edges lose their sharpness at high pressures. Plucker and Hittorf

remark that the blue group widens more easily than the violet groups.

The more refrangible of the two double sodium lines (D2) widens

more than the less refrangible component. According to Ciamician's

experiments, mercury follows the rule, aiid widens the most refrangible

lines most easily. It has often been remarked that all lines lose the

ehai'pness of their edges when the pressure is increased,' but there is a

great difference between the cases we have just mentioned and the lines,
for instance, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine, or nitrogen, which may

become fuzzy, but never spread over an appreciable part of the spectrum.

WeThough the difference is one of degree onl}-, it is very marked.     may

eay that, as a general rule, if a system of lines widens much or easily,

the more refrangible lines of the system will be the first to widen,

while if a system of lines shows the broadening to a small degree only,

no general rule can be given.

    When a line widens, it may do so either symmetrically on both sides,

or the widening may be greater on one side. It is a remarkable fact that

when a line widens chiefly towards one side, that side is in nearly all, if

not in all cases, the less refrangible one.

In the case of the hydrogen lines, it is of some importance to deter-

mine whether they widen symmetrically, because the small displacements

of the line in stars which are referred to star motions, may be in part

due to a one-sided widening. The Greenwich observers * have, therefore,

made a very careful series of measurements, in order to find out whether
the centre of the F line shifts as it broadens. No shift was detected in

a range of pressure from o'O mm. to 600 mm., the width of the line

altering considerably within that range. J. J. Miiller's experiments,

giving an apparently different result, will be presently referred to.

     The lines of sodium seem also to widen nearly equally on both sides.

--ZoUner ^ has examined these lines with his reversion-spectroscope an

instrument which is pre-eminently fitted for such an investigation. He

gives the results in the following words : ' In the more refrangible line,

which, with increase of the vapour-density, was the most widened, no

displacement was perceptible ; meanwliile there appeared to take place in

the other line, as the brightness increased, an extremely slight displace-

ment in the direction of a diminution of the refrangibility.'

     But Zollner does not seem himself to attach very much value to this

observation, the displacement being very .slight. Dr. J. J. Miiller * has

had the curious idea of examining whether the rate of propagation of a
ray of light in space depended on the amplitude of vibration. The wave-

length was measured by means of interference fringes of long difference

of path (Newton's rings), and he was incidentally led to inquire into the

possibility of a displacement of the centre of the sodium lines, when

larger  quantities  of sodium  were         introduced  into a Bnnsen  flame                             in
                                                                                                      ;

which case it is known the lines are seen to widen. Miiller found such

a displacement in the same direction as Zollner, who refers to his

experiments as corroborating his own results. But Miilkr also found the

effect he was looking for that is to say, he found the centre of lines to
                                                                                                                                                         ;

shift when the light was weakened after it had left the flame. Now this

latter part of the investigation has been subjected to a very careful

examination by Lippich,' who could discover no such eSeet. As there nn-

donbte'dly was a source of en-or in Miiller's experiments, which has not

yet been pointed out, we must defer our judgment also on his other

results. When he therefore finds a very slight shifting of the hydrogen

lines, due to an alteration of the power of the spark, we cannot put his

observations on an equal level with the subsequent negative I'esults of the

Greenwich observers.
     Speaking of reversals in the voltaic arc, Mr. Lockyer- adds the

following note : ' The absorption-line does not always occupy the exact

centre of the bright band. This point is occupying my attention, as it

raises a very interesting question connected with molecular vibrations.'

In the j)lates accompanying the paper we find one at least of the

H Kaluminium lines between and slightly more expanded on the less

refrangible side.

Mr. Lockyer ^ has referred to the same question in a recent paper,

and mentions two examples in the silver sjiectrnm. In one case (4210'0)

the line seemed to be much more widened on the more refrangible side of

the absorption line ; in the other case (4054'3), it was more widened in
the opposite direction. The rubidium line (4202) is also given as more

expanded on the less refrangible side.
     Profs. Liveing andDewar'* mention that the magnesium lines (4703)

(4354) widen more on the less refrangible side.
     The lines of the lower temperature spectrum of oxygen widen con-

siderably on the less refrangible side. This is very marked in the case of
the more refrangible of the two green lines, and of the red line. The centre
of the former line shifts through 2Xth metres.^ The less refrangible of

the two green lines widens more symmetrically. According to Ciamician,^
most of the mercury lines show this one-sided widening, and with some

of them it is so marked that they seem exclusively expanded towards one

side only.

I have only come across two cases in which lines seemed to be more

widened on the most refrangible side, and neither of them seems to be

established beyond doubt. The first is the one in the spectrum of silver men-

tioned by Lockyer and quoted above. But Profs. Liveing and Dewar did

not notice the reversal of the line in question, the wave-length of which they

Agive as 4208.      new line, however, came out at 4211-3; that is on the

less refrangible side. It is possible that the dark space between the two

lines was taken by Lockyer for a reversal, and that consequently the greater

intensity and width of the more refrangible line appeared as a one-sided

development of the wings. The second case is not very clearly described

by Ciamician, In the text of the paper he only mentions that when the

double yellow mercury line becomes fuzzy, continuous light is seen to the

right and left of it. In the drawing this is figured as a widening of

the more refrangible line towards the violet, and of the less refi-angible

line towards the red. The description is too vague to allow any certain

inference to be drawn, but it seems possible, as a simple optical fact, that,

when a double line widens, the wings can be traced to a greater distance

on that side of each component which is removed from the other.

   We have now to discuss the causes which may produce the widening

of lines. In the first place it might be suggested that, in accordance

with a formula which we have ah'eady given, an increase of the quantity

of luminous matter would produce an apparent widening of the lines

for it follows from the formula that, unless the coefiicient of absorption

is absolutely zero for any given wave-length, the spectrum sent out by an

Ainfinite number of molecules in the line of sight is always continuous.

greater number of molecules will, therefore, cause the spectrum to ap-

proach the continuous state, and the widening of the lines may be due to

the first stage towards this approach. To this wo shall reply, that an

increase in the number of molecules cannot be the primary cause of the

widening of lines ; for the lines of sodium, for instance, in the sun are

compai'atively sharp, though the thickness of the absorbing layer is

Wegreater than anything we can produce in our experiments.  can

prove the same point more clearly in the case of hydrogen. If we enclose

the gas in a tube of the form adopted by Mr. Monkhoven and Prof.

Piazzi Smyth, so that we may look longitudinally through the capillary

bore, we increase the thickness of the radiating layer to a very great

extent yet lines which are sharp when the tube is looked at transversely,
                                   ;

will remain sharp when it is looked through longitudinally, although an

increase in the pressure or in the intensity of the discharge will at once

produce a widening. It must be remembered that the eS'ect of an in-

creased number of radiating molecules will only depend on the curve of

intensity near the line. If a line is absolutely sharp, no increase in the

number of molecules will ever increase its width, and two lines of the

same brightness, which present the same appearance at their edges, must

behave exactly in the same way, when the thickness of the radiating layer

is increased. Yet, while we have some lines which widen easily and

enormously, others, which present the same appearance, do not show any

widening. That, if a line is once widened, an increase in the number of

radiating or absorbing molecules will increase the apparent extent of the

widening is possible, but we must distinguish this effect from the original

cause which bas produced the widening.

It is, I believe, the almost unanimous opinion of spectroscopists that

the widening is, in most cases, produced by an increase of pressure.

This opinion was first put forward by Frankland and Lockyer.' In the

case of gases, the easiest way to produce the widening is by an increase

in the pressure of the gas, and the metallic lines are also generally seen

to widen when the density of the gas through which the spark is taken

is increased. But we may also, in the case of hydrogen, for instance,

» Proc. Boy. Soc. xvii. p. 288 (1869).
             ON OUR KNOWLEDGK OF SPECTUUM ANALYSIS.  281

-widen the lines by an increase in the intensity of the discharge.' Those

who believe that the widening of a line is due to an increase of pressure,

attribute to an increase in temperature, such as is produced by an in-

creased discharge, an influence only in so far as it raises the pressure of

the gas. This opinion is supported by the fact that the sodium-lines

widen rather more easily at low temperatures.

According to the molecular theory of gases, the following explanation

might be given for the widening of lines.

As long as a molecule vibrates by itself, uninfluenced by any other

molecule, its vibrations will take place in regular periods. The lines of

its spectrum will consequently be sharp. But if the molecule is placed

in proximity with others, its vibrations will be disturbed by occasional

encounters. The number and strength of these collisions will depend on

the pressure of the gas. Ideas analogous to these seem to have been in

the minds of many writers, and it is difficult to decide where they first
occurred ; but we may quote a short passage taken out of a paper by

Lippich,^ in which similar views were, perhaps for the first time, clearly

expressed, and in which the reference to Boyle's law is especially in-

teresting :

' If the pressure of a gas is increased, or if, as in the case of vapours,

its properties are not those any more of a perfect gas ; that is, if the

length of the path during which a molecule is within the influence

of another is not any more small compared to the length of the mean

free path, changes in the spectrum will necessai-ily accompany the new

Newstate of things. . . .  vibrations will arise, the intensity of which

will be the smaller, the further removed they are from the vibrations of

the molecule in the ideal state. The lines of the spectrum will then

appear with indistinct edges and expand the more, the more the gas

deviates from the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac'

The behaviour of the two yellow sodium-lines is in many respects

remarkable. It has already been mentioned that the widening seems to

take place more easily at a lower temperature, but it is obviously not

due to a lowering of temperature, for Profs. Liveing and Dewar' have

observed that a layer of sodium vapour about 4 cm. thick, at atmo-

spheric pi-essure, gave sharp and narrow lines, at a temperature which was

lower than that of a Bunsen burner; while in the Bunsen a much smaller

quantitj' of sodium vapour will produce winged lines. Some of the ex-

periments described in the paper to which we have just referred are not

easily reconciled with the explanation given above for the widening of

lines. Profs. Liveing and Dewar describe the efl'ects of pressure thus :
     ' The efl'ects of compressing the vapour were very remarkable. As

the pressure increased the channelled spectrum speedily disappeared, then

Dthe diffused edges of the     band contracted, the band itself likewise

contracting until it became a very fine pair of lines, or if the amount of

Dsodium present was not too much, came out bright. On letting ofi"

the pressure, the phenomena recurred in the reverse order, and the whole

could be repeated several times. After compression, as long as the

Dpressure was sustained, the absorption remained permanently narrowed,

but did not continue bright.'

     ' Pogg. Ann. cxxxix. p. 465 (1870).

   --* The widening observed by Stearn & Lee {Proc. Soy. Sac. xxi. p. 282 1873) is

due to this cause.

     ' P?'oc. Poy. Sue. xxix. p. 482.
282 REPORT-- 1880.

    The general results of the investigation are summed up by Profs.
Liveing and Dewar thus :

     ' The phenomena attending the compression of the vapours, as well as

those of the amalgams of varying percentages, seem to indicate that the

Dwidth of the absorption is dependent on the thickness and temperature

of the absorption vapour rather than on the whole quantity of sodium
present in it. Very minute quantities diffused into the cool part of the

tube appear to give a broad diffuse absorption, while a layer of denser

vapour of small thickness in the hottest part of the vessel gives but a
very narrow absorption. This may, however, be due to the variation of

temperature.'

    In a previous paper, Profs. Liveing and Dewar ' had expressed them-

selves as follows on the widening of lines :
     ' It is apparent that the expansion of lines so often observed when

fresh materials are introduced, must be ascribed to increase in the density

of the vapours, not to any increase in temperature. Moreover, the length

of the tube, which reaches a very high temperature in the experiments

above described, is very short in the lime crucibles, and still shorter in

the carbon crucible, so that the reversing layer is also short in many

cases.'

There is one cause, which, as Profs. Liveing and Dewar mention,

may have affected the results of the later paper : ' The results of the

foregoing experiments may have been complicated by the sodium- vapour

Wewhich diffused into the cool part of the vessel.  have attempted to

overcome this complication by passing down into the bottle, when full, or

nearly full, of sodium vapour, a platinum tube, closed at the top with a
glass plate and filled with nitrogen, and observing the absorption through
this tube. The nitrogen in the tube prevents, for a short time, the entry

of the sodium vapour into the tube, and so, by passing the tube to differ-

ent depths, the thickness of the layer of sodium through which the

observations were made could be varied. It was found, in this way, that

a layer of sodium-vapour, about 4 cm. thick, at the atmospheric pressure

Dat the temperature of our furnace, gave the absorption sharp and very

narrow ; but as the sodium diffused into the tube the absorption extended
until it produced a broad band with difiTuse edges.'

In these experiments, the light emitted by the bottom of the platinum

vessel, in which the sodium was evaporated served as the source of light,

the absorption of which on its passage through the vapour was observed.

Now it is clear that, had the vapour been throughout of the same tem-

perature with the vessel, the absorption would have exactly counter-
balanced the radiation, and no effect would have been produced. The

absorption which was produced was, therefore, entirely due only to the

vapour in the parts of the tube which were cooler than the bottom. If,

therefore, the effect of compression was to di'ive down the vapour into

the hotter part of the tube, a thinning out of the absorption would be a

necessaiy consequence, and no conclusions as to the effect of pressure

can be drawn. On the other hand, it is difficult to see why, even in the

compressed tube, the vapour should not have gradually diffused into the
cooler parts. The disappearance of the channelled- space spectrum of

sodium, however, in the compressed vapour, indicates a higher tempera-

ture, and consequently a diminished absorption.

         ' Proc. Roy. Sor. xxviii. p. 370.
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.      283

Taking the whole of these experiments together, they do, I believe,

indicate that the lines of sodium widen more easily at a comparatively

low temperature ; but, as they may also be seen very wide at high tempera.-

tnres and narrow at low ones, they leave the original cause of the widen-

ing unexplained.

The fact that the sodium lines widen more easily at a comparatively

low temperature is in accordance with the theoretical speculations we

have given on the cause of the widening of lines. For in the passage

quoted Lippich has remarked that an increased widening of lines would

go on simultaneously with an increased deviation from Boyle's law ; and

that deviation will be greater when the vapour approaclies its temperature

of condensation.

Moreover, the widening of the sodium lines seems to take place

chiefly at the temperature at which the line-spectrum changes into the

band-spectrum. It will be seen further on that, according to the opinion

held by most spectroscopists the band-specti'um is due to a molecule con-

taining a greater number of atoms than that giving the line spectrum.

If this opinion is true, sodium vapour ought to show a change of vapour-

density as one spectrum changes into the other, similar to that which has

recently been proved to exist in iodine by Victor Meyer.' That at the

moment when the atoms or molecules of sodium have a tendency to com-

bine with each other, the molecu^lar forces should be afEected and dis-

turbed in such a way as to produce a widening of lines seems perfectly
intelligible. At the same temperature at which the band spectrum of

sodium changes into the line spectrum, Mi*. Lockyer has observed some

very remarkable phenomena.^ In some parts of the tube in which the

sodium was volatilized, the Hues seemed to widen only toAvai-ds one side,

while in others they were widened towards the other side. It is, perhaps,
worth mentioning, in connection with a remark by Lord Rayleigh on dis-

turbed vibrations,^ that the two parts of the band-spectrum of sodium lie

Don the two sides of the lines.

Referring again to the effect of pressure on the Avideuing of lines the

question arises, whether for a given temperature and pressure a line may

be of different width whether the molecule is placed in an atmosphere of

Wesimilar or dissimilar molecules.        shall have occasion to refer to this

point again, and to show that such a difference in all probability exists,

and tliat it is not due to a mere reduction or increase in the number of

Weluminous molecules in the line of sight.  may mention here for

instance that Mr. Lockyer ^ has observed that tlie lines of oxygen or

nitrogen may be obtained sharp at atmospheric pressure by mixing a

small quantity of one gas with the other. The gas which is present

in small quantities has its lines sharp. If, therefore, we observe that in
putting larger quantities of sodium into a flame we widen the lines,
we must take many questions into account, and not conclude merely

that an increased thickness of the radiating layer has produced the result.

   We finally refer to one cause which limits the sharpness of sjiectro-

scopic lines, and which was fix-st pointed out by Lippich* and later by
Lord Rayleigh.*^ The molecules of a gas are, in addition to their vibratory

motion, endowed with a ti-anslatory motion. Those molecules which are

light which is slightly more refrangible than that which would be sent
out by a quiescent molecule or one moving at right angles to the line of

sight. On the other hand the molecules which are moving away from us

will have the wave-length increased. The lines as they appear to us, and
as they come from molecules moving in all directions, must have a certain
width. Lippich has pointed out how this limit of sharpness which cannot
be surpassed may be made use of to determine which lines in a mixture of
gases are due to each component ; for the heavier gas will have its lines
narrower than the lighter gas. As a rule, however, the lines of a spec-
trum are wider than the limit given, and especially the widening of lines
which we have beea discussing in this chapter is of a much higher order

of magnitude.

             III. Spectra of Different Orders.

    Spectra may be classified according to their general appearance. The

Wedifferent classes have been called orders by Pliicker and Hittorf.

have first, appearing at the highest temperature, the line spectra which

are best known and need no further description ; we have next produced,

generally at lower temperatures, the spectra of channelled spaces, the ap-

pearance of which was described in the introduction to the report on the

spectra of metalloids. Continuous spectra, which need not necessarily

stretch through the whole range of the spectrum, form a third order.

Pliicker and Hittorf have shown that one and the same element may pos-

sess at difierent temperatures specti-a of different orders. Their results

Ahave been confirmed in the case of a great many different elements.

discussion has naturally arisen on the cause which can produce such a

Weremarkable change of spectra.         first quote Pliicker and Hittorf's'

opinion on the subject :

' Certainly in the present state of science we have not the least indica-

tion of the connection of the molecular constitution of the gas with the

kind of light emitted by it ; but we may assert with confidence, that if

one spectrum of a given gas be replaced by quite a different one, there

must be an analogous change of the constitution of the ether, indicating

a new arrangement of the gaseous molecules. Consequently we must

admit either a chemical decomposition or an allotropic state of the gas.

Conclusions derived from the whole series of our researches lead us

finally to reject the first alternative and to adopt the other.'

The idea that different spectra of one and the same element are due

to differences of molecular structure has fou^nd considerable favour with

spectroscopists. It has formed the leading idea of a large part of Lock-

yer's ^ work, who gave the following five stages through which spectra

often pass, each stage being in his opinion due to a different molecular

structure :

1. Line-spectrum.

2. Channelled-space spectrum.

3. Continuous absorption in the blue.

4. Continuous absorption in the red.

5. Continuous absorption throughout.

Salet^ also adheres to the opinion that different spectra are due to

different allotropic states. Helmholtz, as quoted by Moser,"* has suggested

that the line-spectra may be due to atoms, the band-spectra to molecules.

The same idea was more fully developed by B. Wiedemann.' Even
Angstrom and Thalen,^ who do not adopt Pliicker's interpretation of his

experiments, remark :

We' do cei'tainly not deny that a simple body may in certain cases

Wegive different spectra.  may quote, for instance, the absorption- spec-

trum of iodine, which does not in any way resemble the system of bril-

liant rays of the same body,  obtained by  means  of  electricity                                                and Ave
                                                                                                              ;

may remark moreover, that in general every simple body, presenting the

property of allotropy, must in the state of incandescence give different

spectra, provided that this property of allotropy exists not only in the
gaseous state of the body, but also at the temperature of incandescence.

      ' Supposing, therefore, that there is really allotropy, even for the
gaseous state, a certain absorption-spectrum must belong to every one of

these allotropic states.'

    An idea which has commended itself to so many different observers

must possess a large amount of plausibility ; but before we give various
reasons and facts which seem to support it we must first refer to the only

rival hypothesis which has been offered. This theory is founded on the
formula given by Zdllner, and already quoted in this report, which con-
nects the intensity of radiation of each line with the number of radiating

molecules in a line of sight. Zollner already mentioned the possibility
of explaining spectra of different orders by means of it, but the idea was

chiefly developed by Wiillner. Starting from the fact that band-spectra
are generally given by the brush discharge, in which a great number of
molecules are luminous, while the line-spectra are given by the spark,

which, as a rule, is thin ; also that the band-spectra often appear in the
wide part of a Pliicker tube, while the line-spectra are seen in the capil-

lary part, Wiillner concludes that the thickness of the radiating layer

materially affects the spectrum which is seen. The difficulty which
stands in the way of this explanation lies in the fact that the maxima of

light in the band-spectrum lie altogether in other places than in the line-

spectra. To overcome this difficulty, as has been pointed out by B.
Wiedemann,^ we must assume a change in the emissive power with tem-

perature different for each ray of the spectrum. Zollner,* for instance,

remarks :

    ' But these values (the coefficients of absorption) may have for the

same toave-length and continuous alteration of the temperature, similar

maxima and minima to those which they, in fact, possess for the same tem-
perature and continuous alteration of the wave-length, whereby they pro-

duce the phenomenon of discontinuous spectrum.'

Wiillner,^ referring to the same point, says :

     ' Hereby it is by no means necessary or even probable, that the ab-
sorption power increases for all rays in the same way ; that, therefore, the
ratio of the values of and for different wave-lengths is the same at all

temperatures. As soon as such a change takes place, a displacement of the
maxima of light will, or at least may, be produced. But it is only such
a displacement of the maxima of light, if the bright lines of a line-spec-
trum are situated at other places than the maxima of illumination of a

band- spectrum. In this way lines of a line- spectrum can really disappear,

while at their place in the band-spectrum an even illumination or even a

decreased brightness exists compared to that of surrounding places.'

   We have introduced these quotations in order to show that both

Zollnerand Wiillner are aware that a mere alteration in density or thick-

ness of the radiating layer is insufficient to account for the changes in

spectra, but that a change in the absorptiA'^e and emissive properties of
the gas is necessary. But it is further evident that once we assume this
change we need not any more have recourse to any effects of increased

number of radiating molecules ; for the change itself would be sufficient

to account for the phenomena, which could at most be affected, but not

Weproduced, by an increased thickness of the radiating layer.                                      may

therefore jjass over the experiments which Dr. Goldstein ' has made in

order to show that an increased thickness of spark does not produce the

effects required by Wiillner's theory ; and, consequently, also over the

answer which Wiillner ^ has given to Dr. Goldstein's remarks.

The difference between the two explanations really comes to this :

Zollner and Wiillner assume that the i-adiation for a given wave-length is

a continuous function of the temperature, which may be different for

different wave-lengths,             and for          each  may have  maxima  and      minima                                              in
                                                                                                                                       ;

other words, that the spectrum is a continuous function of the temperature.

Those who adopt the rival hypothesis hold that the spectrum is within

wide limits independent of the temperature, but that at certain points

sudden changes in the forces which bind the atoms together take place,

and that these changes are accompanied by a sudden change in the

spectrum. It is likely that these changes are produced by a different

number of atoms bound together in one molecule.

The change of the channelled-space spectrum of sodium to the line

spectrum seems indeed to take place within narrow limits of temperature.

If the absorption of that vapour is observed at low temperatures, so that

the channelled-space spectrum is observed, and the temperature is

Dgradually raised, little change is seen for some time. The lines, though

present, are sharp and faint. When a certain temjjerature is reached,

however, these lines seem suddenly to get blacker ; the bands at the same

time weaken, and as they become dimmer and finally disappear, the whole

Denergy of the motion seems to be thrown into the lines, which now are

widened into a broad black band. The change is exactly such as would

be produced by a change in the molecular structure of the gas at the given

temperature, and it is very likely that a change of density will be proved

to take place at that temperature.

    Those who adopt this view of the cause of multiple spectra, support it
by the fact that in many cases where we know a change of density to occur,

changes in the spectra are observed perfectly analogous to those which

we want to explain. Thus, for instance, sulphur vapour near its boiling

point has an anormal vapour-density ; it then shows a continuous absorp-

tion                       as  the  temperature  is  raised and the  density becomes  normal, the
                        ;

spectrum changes into a channelled-space spectrum. Iodine, bromine,

and chlorine give us spectra of fluted bands at low temperatures ; but if

we pass an electric spark through them, line spectra are obtained. The

recent experiments of Victor Meyer and others seem to show that the

vapour density is different in the two cases.

    An apparent exception occurs in the case of nitrous oxide gas, which

                           ' Bcrl. Btr. 1874, August, p. 593, and Phil. Mag. xcix. p. 333 (1875).

on heating changes its vapour-density and its molecular structure from
NON2O2 to
                                             without showing an equally marked change in its spectrum.

But the exception is apparent only, for the absorption spectrum gets very-
much stronger as the temperature is raised, so that we have every reason

to suppose that the spectrum we observe is really due to the molecule NO.

"We ought at the same time to expect the spectrum belonging to N2O2 to

get weaker, and finally to disappear. As, however, it is a general rule

that the specti^um of a more complex molecule lies more to the red than

that of the simpler molecule, it is likely that the spectrum of NjOg lies in

the extreme red and ultra-red. Moser' indeed has found that three

bands which are observed in the absorption spectrum of nitrons oxide at

low temperatures disappear when the temperature is raised ; these bands
therefore we may ascribe to ISToOg, which gas very likely possesses a
greater number still further towards the red.

    When chemical combination takes place a change in the spectrum is

observed which is entirely similar to that observed in many vapours when

the temperature is lowered. The spectra of the oxides, chlorides, bromides,

and iodides of the alkaline earths are spectra of fluted bands. If a com-

bination of one element with another can change a line spectrum into a

channelled- space spectrum, it is quite a plausible assumption to suppose

that a combination of one element with itself can produce an analogous

change, and that as a rule a spectrum of channelled spaces corresponds

to a more complicated molecular structure.

The question is likely to be definitely settled by a new line of inves-

tigation which has been started by Prof B. Wiedemann,^ and which, if

followed out further, will largely add to our store of knowledge on these

and similar points. Prof. Wiedemann has undertaken calorimetric

measurements, in order to see whether or not heat is absorbed by a gas

when a change of spectrum takes place. He has taken hydrogen gas as a

first example, and measured the heat produced by a spark, equaUsing the
same difference of potential, fir.st when the gas gives a band spectrum,

and, secondly, when it gives the line spectrum. The change from one

spectrum to the other was produced by a minute change in the length of

an air- break, which was introduced into the circuit. Prof Wiedemann has

found indeed that a certain amount of heat is necessary to change the
band spectrum into the line spectrum, and that this heat is independent

of the pressure and cross section of the tube.

These experiments would be decisive if we were quite certain of the

chemical origin of the band spectrum investigated by Prof Wiedemann.

According to several spectroscopists this band spectrum is due to a hydro-

carbon                                   so  that  if this  is  the  case.  Prof Wiedemann would really have
                                      ;

measured the heat of combination of hydrogen and carbon. Prof.

E. Wiedemann will no doubt follow out this most promising line of

research in the case of other gases, the spectrum of which has been

investigated with more decisive results.

     It is often found that metallic vapours near their point of condensation
give an absorption which is continuous through part or the whole visible

range of the spectrum. Even some gases like oxygen give us continuous

spectra at the lowest temperature at which they are luminous. In the

case of sulphur the appearance of the continuous spectrum is coincident
with the anormal vapour- density, and is therefore no doubt produced by

' Fogg. Ann. clx. p. 177 (1877).                                            » Wied. Ann. x. p. 202 (1880).

the more complete molecule. It would not be unreasonable to suppose

that a similar cause prodnces also the other cases of continuous absorption.

But Prof. Stokes ' has suggested another cause which may produce such

a continuous absorption :

'We have reason to believe that the mere motion of matter through

the ether is insufficient to produce vibrations. There must be two portions

of matter exerting forces on each other in order that the ether should

be thrown into agitation. In ordinary line-spectra we consider that

the two portions of matter form part of the .same molecule. Now, it

seems possible that also two portions of different molecules should in

their rapid approach towards each other, or recession from each other,

cause forces in the ether which produce vibration. These latter vibrations

we might exjiect not to take place in fixed periods, but to produce what

Wewe call a continuous spectrum.  may suppose that at the lowest

temperature at which, for instance, oxygen is luminous, the vibrations in

the ether are chiefly produced by this rapid relative motion of different

molecules, while at higher temperatures the relative motions of different

portions of one molecule might have the upper hand; the continuous

spectrum in one case, and the line spectrum in the other, might thus be

explained.'

                        IV. The Method of Long and Short Lines.

     If the spectrum of a metal is taken by passing the spark between two
poles in air, the pressure of which is made to vary, the relative intensity
of some of the lines is often seen to change. Similar variations take place
if the intensity of the discharge is altered, as, for instance, by interposing
or taking oat a Leyden jar. It is a matter of importance to be able to use
a method which in the great majority of cases will give us at once a sure
indication how each line will behave under different circumstances. This
method we now proceed to describe.

     It has often been stated, even by the earliest observers, that the
metallic lines when seen in a spectroscope do not always stretch across the
whole field of view, but are sometimes confined only to the neighbourhood

of metallic poles. Some observations which Mr. Lockyer had made jointly
with Prof. Prankland '^ led him to conclude that the distance to which
each metallic line stretched away from the pole could give some clue on

the behaviour of that line in the sun. In the year 1872 Mr. Lockyer ^
worked out this idea and obtained important results.

     In his experiments an image of the spark was formed on the slit of the
spectroscope, so that the spectrum of each section of the spark could be

examined. Some of the metallic lines were then seen to be confined

altogether to the neighbourhood of the poles, while others stretched nearly
across the whole field. The relative length of all the lines was carefully

estimated. Tables and maps are added to the memoir.

    In order at once to clear up a widespread misapprehension we may
mention that the longest lines (that is, those which stretch away furthest
from the pole) are by no means always the strongest. Even spectro-

scopists use the terms, longest line and strongest line, sometimes as

    ' See note to paper by Schuster ' On the Spectrum of Oxygen,' Phil. Trans, clxx.

references to previous observations bearing on the subject.

   synonymous ; but those who are accustomed to work with a lens between
   the spark and the slit, will be able to give many instances where a faint

   line is seen to stretch nearly across the whole field of view, while a strong-

   line may be confined to the neighbourhood of the pole, and is reduced

   sometimes to a brilliant point onlj^.

      We give a few conspicuous examples, to which we shall have occasion

   to refer again. The remarks refer to the length of the lines in sparks

   condensed by means of a Leydeu jar.
        Lithium : The blue line (46027) is brilliant but short. It is given by

   Thalen as stronger than the orange line, which is much longer.

        Lead: 4062'5, one of the longest lead lines, but faint, and according"

   to Lockyer difiicult to observe.

   Tin : 56300 is the longest tin line, but it is faint, while the stronger

   lines near it (5588'5 and 5562'5) are shorter.

   Zinc: The zinc lines (4923-8, 4911-2, 4809-7, 4721-4, 4679'5) are

   given by Thalen as of equal intensity, but the three more refrangible oneg,

   are longer.

   As a first result, Mr. Lockyer found that, by a reduction of pressui-e,,

   some of the shorter lines rapidly decreased in length and disappeared,

   Avhile the longer lines remained visible and were sometimes hardly affected.

   It follows, therefore, that a reduction of pressure may change the relative

   intensity of the lines ; for a stronger, but shorter, line may disappear,

   Wewhile a weaker and longer one remains.           may quote, for instance,

   Mr. Lockyer's remark on the behaviour of the zinc lines, when the pres-

   sure is reduced.

        ' In the case of zinc, the effect of these circumstances was very marked,^

   and they may be given as a sample of the phenomena generally observed.

   When the pressure-gauge connected with the Sprengel pump stood at from

   35 to 40 mm., the spectrum at the part observed was normal, except that

   the two lines 4924 and 4911 (both of which, when the spectrum is observed

   under the normal pressure, are lines with thick wings) were considerably

   reduced in width. On the pump being started, these lines rapidly decreased

   --in length, as did the line at 4679, 4810 and 4721 being almost unaffected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

   at last the two at 4924 and 4911 vanished, as did 4679, and appeared

   only at intervals as spots on the poles, the two 4810 and 4721 remaining

   little changed in length, though much in brilliancy. This experiment
   was repeated four times, and on each occasion the gauge was found to bo

   almost at the same point, "viz. :

   1st observation, when the lines 4924 and 491 1 were

                gone, the gauge stood at                .  30 millimetres.

   'A rise to 34 milhmetres was sufficient to restore the lost lines.'

        Mr. Lockyer next examined the spectra given by chemical compounds r
   ' It was found in all cases that the difference between the spectrum of
   the chloride and the spectrum of the metal was : That under the same
   spark conditions the short lines vjere obliterated, ivhile the air lines remained
   unchanged in thichness.'

   Thus, for instance, when the spark was taken from zinc chloride, it

   did not show the lines 4923 and 4911, which, though of equal brightness

   with 4809, 4721, 4679, are shorter, and disappear, as we have seen, when

   the pressure is reduced. The three last-mentioned lines were seen.

     The strongest-lines of aluminium in the green and blue are not seen
when a spai'k is taten from the chloride, but the longest lines falling

H Kbetween the solar and are seen.

   --Cadmium is also a striking case, for while the longest lines 5085,
--4799, 4677 are seen in the specti'um of the chloride, the equally bright

but shorter lines, 5378, 5338, do not appear.
     Other examples are given by Mr. Lockyer.
     In a subsequent paper the same author ' has examined the spectra of

the com^Jounds of lead, strontium, barium, magnesium, and sodium with
chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine, and has confirmed his previous

results.

An alloy behaves in the same manner as a chemical compound : ' For

instance, it is possible to begin with an alloy which shall only give us the

longest line or lines in the spectrum of the smallest constituent, and by

increasing the quantity of this constituent the other lines can be intro-

duced in the order of their length. This reaction is so delicate that I

learnt from it a thing I had not before observed, that the least refrangible

line of C, the triple line of magnesium, is really a little longer than its

more refrangible compound ; for the spectrum of magnesium was reduced

to this one line in an alloy in which special precautions had been taken to

introduce the minimum of magnesium.'

This behaviour of alloys was subsequently made the basis of a quanti-

tative spectrum analysis by Messrs. Lockyer and Roberts.^ Comparing the

spectra of metals as obsei-ved by this method with their reversal in the

solar atmosphere, Mr. Lockyer found that it was the longest line and not

necessarily the strongest line which was first reversed in the sun.

Subsequent work has shown that the longest lines are also generally

those which are most persistent on a reduction of temperature. The short

lines, which disappeared on a reduction of temperature and were not
visible in the spectrum of the chlorides, also disappear when the metal is

volatilized in the arc instead of the spark. Thus the strong zinc lines

A4924, 4911, which we have already mentioned, disappear in the ai'C.

similar i"em ark applies to the two cadmium lines, 5377, 5336 which Profs.
Liveing and Dewar ^ found to be absent in the arc, and which, as we have

seen, are also absent in the spectrum of the chloride. The strong but

short magnesium line 4481, is also absent in the arc, as is shown in

Rand Capron's 'Photographed Spectra.'^

In this way many facts which have often puzzled observers, are

brought under one general law. Take, for instance, the three tin lines

to which we have already drawn attention. The least refrangible is the

Welongest, but it is faint, while the two others are strong.     conclude from

this that at low temperatures this faint line is stronger than the other

two, while if the temperature is raised the two most refrangible lines are

the strongest. This is fully confirmed by expei'iment. Lecoq de Bois-

baudran,^ who usually employed the spark without condenser from a

strongest, and mentions that the line is weakened by the introduction of

the condenser.

     It is a corollary of what has been said that if we produce the reversals

of lines by means of laboratory experiments, we sball always first reverse

the longest lines, for the order in which the lines reverse will be the order

of intensities at the temperature of the reversing layer. This is also con-

firmed by experiment. Thus Coruu ' has reversed the two aluminium

Hlines between and K. These are the longest lines, according to Lockyer,

and they are also the only two lines which are reversed in the sun,

although aluminium possesses some very strong lines in other parts of the

spectrum. Zinc and cadmium gave similar results. The order in which

the metallic lines reverse had been made the subject of a series of investi-

gations by Liveing and Dewar, and their results tend to confirm the law

given by Lockyer. Although some differences exist between the order of

reversal given by Liveing and Dewar ^ and the order of length given by

Lockyer, it must be left for further inquiry to see whether the differences

are real. The difficulty in estimating the relative length of two lines which

are not very near together, must be very great, and no doubt some of

the lengths as given by Lockyer may require some corrections. Thus, for

instance, Profs. Liveing and Dewar have reversed the lines 5085, 4799, 4677

of cadmium, but not 4416. This agrees with Lockyer's law, for the three

first are longer than the last ; but they have seen the line 6438 reversed

once, and this line is given by Lockyer as shorter than 4416. But from

the great intensity of 6438 in Lecoq's drawing, we should infer that it

was really a long line, and that the length given by Lockyer is not correct.
With the other metals, where a comparison is possible, the two lines of

investigation seem to lead to the same result. Lead first reversed 4058

and subsequently 4063                                                                                                        this  is the order of  their  length,  though                                            4063  is
                                                                                                                          ;

faint at the temperature of the spark, and other much stronger lines have

not been reversed.

The fact that a reduction of quantity, as for instance in an alloy,

destroys the shorter though perhaps stronger lines, and leaves the longest,
is more remarkable than might at first sight appear. Lecoq de Boisbau-
dran has studied the effect of diluting the liquids which he used as
electrodes, and his results confirm Lockyer's law of the longest lines.

Thus, for instance : lithium in the flame gives the red line very much

stronger than the orange line. The red line is the longest, but with a
concentrated solution and a spark Lecoq ^ found the orange line to be

stronger                                    dilution with water,                                                                   however, at ohce gave preponderance again

6438, which is stronger in a concentrated solution than 4677, but is

·weakened by dilution, being in reality a shorter line.

     After having given the facts relating to the question of long and short

Imes, we have to see whether we can find a theoretical explanation of

these facts.

    The first explanation which naturally occurs to everyone would make

the appearance of the long and short lines depend on the greater thick-

ness of luminous matter surrounding the electrodes. As this thickness

decreases we should expect to see more and more lines disappear and only

the most persistent lines remain. These most persistent lines would be

the longest.                                But  this  explanation will                                                            not account for         the facts                                                  for as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

we have said the longest lines are not always the strongest, and we have

proved, in the first chapter of this report, that an increase of thickness

could never change the relative intensity of two lines when the least

refrangible of them is the strongest. Tet we constantly find that a less

refrangible line is longer, but weaker throughout its length, than one which

is situated more towards the violet. If an increased thickness of luminous

matter was the cause of the appearance of the shorter line near the pole,

we should have in this case, for a larger thickness, the more refrangible

line the stronger; but in the centre of the spark, where there is little

luminous matter and where the least refrangible long line is the only one

seen, this would be the strongest. This cannot possibly be due to the effect

only of decreased thickness. The fact that the longest lines are those

appearing at lower temperature, though in the experiments of Lecoq and

Liveing and Dewar, the quantity of luminous matter is really larger than

when a high tension spark is employed, also disproves the theory that

thickness of the luminous layer has much to do with the explanation of

the long and short lines.

    The next explanation which we shall discuss, starts from the fact that

Athe longest lines become stronger when the temperature is reduced.

metal at low temperatures has a certain number of lines ; as the tempera-

ture is increased other lines may come out, which may gain in intensity

and finally surpass the original lines. These lines coming out at higher

temperature would be the short lines, while the long lines would be the

low-temperature lines. This explanation accounts very satisfactorily for

a part of the phenomena, as for instance the disapjjearance of the long

lines when the pressure of the gas in which the spark is taken is reduced
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

for the temperature of the spark will be lowered in that case. Also the

fact that the longest lines are those which first reverse would flow

naturally out of the explanation given. But the explanation is not com-

Whyplete.  should a mixture of different elements only show the longest

line of that constituent which is present in small quantities ? In the

case of chemical combinations we might assume that the spark having to

do the work of decomposition is weakened, and that therefore the low-

temperature lines ai'e obtained. But this could no longer be if a chemical

compound is replaced by a mechanical mixture. There is no reason why

a spark taken from a mechanical mixture of two bodies should be cooler

than one taken from each body singly. Nor could the remarkable effects

of dilution, which we have already mentioned, be accounted for solely

Weon the supposition that the long lines are low-temperature lines.

require aa additional hypothesis. Speaking of the widening of the

sodium lines it has already been suggested that, under the same pressure,

at the same temperature, and for the same number of radiating molecules,
we might have a difference in the spectrum if the molecules with which it

comes into collision are molecules of the same kind only or are chiefly

molecules of a different kind. I think we must have recourse to the same

explanation in order to account for the facts which are now before us.

For if an alloy shows us at the same temperature the longer lines only of

each constituent, this may at any rate be due to the fact that the shorter

lines are more easily produced by the molecules of the same kind than by

Wethose of a different kind.  must, in fact, assume, in order to account

for the phenomena, that the spectrum of a molecule, when it is excited by

molecules of another kind, consists of those lines chiefly which a molecule

of the same kind is capable of bringing out at a lower temperature already.

It would follow from this that the effects of dilution are the same as those

Weof a reduction of temperature, which is the case.  shall speak of this
          ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.      293

hypothesis, which may explain the behaviour of long and short lines as

the hypothesis of molecular shocks, for according to it the short lines are

brought out by a greater intensity of molecular shocks.
     There is, however, another way of looking at these phenomena, which

is advocated by Mr. Lockyer. If we carefully examine the spectnim of a

metal, an image of the spark being projected on the slit of the spectro-

scope, and if we observe the changes which a spectrum undergoes when
the temperature or pressure is altered, we cannot fail to be struck by the
fact that we can generally divide the lines into two, or sometimes perhaps
more than two sets, the lines in each set varying together. _ The question
forces itself on the observer whether we have not to deal in one and the

same spark with two or more overlapping spectra which vary relatively to
each other. The faint lines which stretch sometimes like ghosts away

from the poles into the centre of the spark, would belong to one spectrum,

the short brilliant, often winged, lines, which are only confined to the

neighbourhood of the pole, would belong to another.

   A spark would show that set of lines strongest which belongs to the

molecular grouping which is present in the largest quantity within the

spark. The relative quantity of different molecules may vary with the

distance from the pole, and thus a line which is strongest in the centre of

the spark may be weakest near the pole. If a spark is taken from different

chemical compounds, or from alloys, that set would show which is due to

the particular grouping in which the element is contained in the com-

Wepound.  shall speak of this hypothesis as the hypothesis of molecular

combination. Both suppositions which we have mentioned, and to which

we shall have to refer again, express the facts fairly well, but neither of

them is free from difficulty.

V. Other Changes in the Relative Intensity of Lines.

"We have given in the preceding pages a method by means of which

the study of a spectrum shown in one given spark, will indicate to us its

behaviour under a great many diffei'ent circumstances. What we have

said is true within sufficiently wide limits to render the method an

extremely valuable one, but if the range of temperature or pressure within

which our experiments are made is pushed beyond a certain point, further

considerations will have to be taken into account. That the method

must or may ultimately break down appears both from the experimental

results wliich we have given and from the two possible theoretical ex-

Weplanations which we have mentioned.  have quoted, for instance, the

behaviour of some zinc lines, when the pressure at which the spark is

Wetaken is reduced.  have seen that while three long zinc lines have

remained comparatively unaffected, two equally strong but shorter lines

near it rapidly decreased in length and finally disappeared. Now suppos-

ing that instead of decreasing the pressure we had increased it, the lines

Avhich rapidly decreased in length would increase more rapidly than the

others, and thus, unless all lines tend towards one fixed limit, the shorter

lines might finally outgrow the long ones. At that point the method of

long and short lines would fail to give us correct results. Mr. Lockyer *

has drawn attention to another cause which renders the method unsafe,

if the temperature is pushed beyond a certain point. According to the

two hypotheses, which, as we have seen, fairly well account for the facts,

          ' Proc. Boy. Soc. xxviii. p. 157 (1879).
294 REPOKT-- 1880.

tlie long lines are due to a comparatively cool state of tlie metallic

vapour. Now, according to the theory of molecular shocks, it is an open
question how the long lines behave when the temperature is increased

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

they may get stronger, they may not alter their intensity, or they may

get weaker. According to the hypothesis of molecular combinations, on
the other hand, the long lines must necessarily get weaker and finally
disappear. Now, in reahty, they do get weaker and finally disappear in

many cases. Thus in the case of calcium, Mr. Lockyer ^ has pointed out

that the blue line which is the strongest at the temperature of the Bunsen
burner, of the arc, and even of a weak electric spark, gradually weakens
when the intensity of the spark is increased, and finally disappears with a

coil of large power. Now supposing we observed the length of this

calcium line, as the spark is gradually increased. At first it would not

only be the longest but also the strongest line ; as the temperature is

raised, the line, while still remaining the longest, Avould decrease in

strength and would finally disappear. But it may not disappear at the

same time throiighout its length. If the temperature of the spark is

nearly equal throughout its length, the greater quantity of matter surround-
ing the electrode would increase its visibility near the pole. In that case

the line would shorten before it disappears. If, on the other hand, the

temperature of the spark is decidedly higher near the pole, the line would

first disappear there, and remain longest in the centre of the spark. It

would be interesting to decide experimentally how the line actually does
behave. In the mean time, we may say that, as Mr. Lockyer has pointed
out, a short line may not only be the first indication of a state of things
as they are at a higher temperature, but may also be due to the last

remnant of the state of things as they are at a lower temperature.

   We have, besides this calcium line, many other lines which disappear

when the temperatui'e is raised. Thus, of the violet rubidium lines
(4216, 4202), only the more refrangible one remains in the spark. The
two blue calcium lines both disappear when a condenser is used. The

disappearance of these lines is always accompanied by the appearance of

other strong lines.

When indium is volatilised in a flame, two lines (4509, 4101) are

Aseen.      third line (4532) is given on Thalen's list. According to

Messrs. Clayden and Heycock,^ this third line appears when the spectram

is taken from the chloride or from the nitrate, but disappears when the

spark is taken from metallic indium. Other strong lines, however, in

different parts of the spectrum, replace it in that case.

There are sometimes Unes appearing at low temperatures, but behaving

differently from proper low-temperature lines. These lines require

further investigation, and may in some cases, at least, be due to some

Wecompounds of the metals with other elements present.     give some

examples :

Lead (5005). Mr. Brassak,' who was the first to investigate the

differences observed in metallic spectra, when a condenser is put in or

out of circuit, has noticed that in lead, without condenser, a strong line

appears at the point indicated. Mr. Huggins,^ who has found this line to

be sensibly coincident with the chief line of nebulas, has used it as a
reference, by means of which he might detect a proper motion of these

celestial bodies. He mentions tbat this line appears vciy strong nnder

conditions nnder which the other lead lines are weak. The line is given
as a strong line by Lecoq de Boisbandran, who used feeble sparks, and
these facts wonld suggest that it is a low-temperature line of lead. But
Thalen has already pointed out that the line is only seen in the neigh-
bourhood of the electrodes, and it figures as a short line on Lockyer's
map. Also Profs. Liveing and Dewar, who have reversed the long lines

of lead, do not notice the reversal of this line.

     Ti7i (6100). Salet ' notices that when a hydrogen flame contains a
compound of tin, an orange line appears which is apparently coincident
with the orange line of Uthium. This line does not figure on any of the

maps of the tin spectrum.
     Zinc. Lockyer ^ found that zinc, volatilized in an iron tube, showed

by absorption a green line. Liveing and Dewar ^ do not mention having
seen this line reversed, but it is very likely the line, 5184, given by Lecoq
de Boisbaudran, and proved by him not to be due to an impurity.

     Sodium and Potassium. In the absorption spectra of sodium and
potassium, lines appear in the green which were noticed by Roscoe and
Schuster,* but referred by them to known metallic lines of these bodies ;
but Profs. Liveing and Dewar ^ have pointed out that they are not coin-
cident with any known metallic lines. They have determined the wave-

lengths for sodium to be 5510, and for potassium, 5730.
     This is the place ^o notice some remarkable phenomena mentioned by

Mr. Lockyer.^ He passed a spark through an exhausted tube, below the

lower pole, a piece of sodium was heated, and under the experimental
conditions mentioned in the paper, the vapour above the sodium arranged
itself in layers of different colours. The layer adjoining the sodium was
green, and showed the green and red sodium lines without the yellow
lines, while the layer above was yellow, and only showed the yellow
lines, without the green and red. Mr. Lockyer also could obtain the
yellowish-green lines of potassium without the red. In a subsequent
paper, Mr. Lockyer ^ has opened out the question whether the spectrum
of an element as it separates out of different combinations containing

different numbers of atoms of the element in question, is identical or not.

This is an important point, but does not come within the range of this

report.

     The question has been raised how far the presence of a molecule of a
different kind may affect the spectrum of an element. The wide range

within which Mr. Lockyer's law of long and short lines, and the elimi-

nation of impurities affected thereby, is true, shows that in a great many

cases at any rate, the admixture of another atom only alters the spectrum
in so far as it gives a greater prominence to the long lines ; but Mr. Lockyer*^
himself had brought forward examples in which the law of long and

short lines does not hold. He has obtained a spectrum of iron in which

the longest manganese lines were absent, while some shorter ones were

strongly represented. The question is connected with the preceding one,

and its discussion is not possible at present, as the material is still too

scanty.

under different siDark-conditions would be of great value. The relative

intensity of the two strongest hydrogen lines in a series of experiments
was estimated by the Greenwich observers.' Messrs. Trankland and

Lockyer ^ had already pointed out that on a reduction of pressure the

blue line (F) is the last to disappear ; and Mr. Lockyer^ afterwards pointed

out that an increase of temperature made the red line stronger, In the

published results of the Greenwich observations the pressure of a va-

cuum tube varied between 387 mm. and 100 mm. The relative intensities

are given as follows :

                             Pressure = 387 mm. Ha = 10 Hj8 = 10

                                                         297 10 8
                                                        217 10 8
                                                          100 10 9

In the last case the F line was considerably narrower than before, and

this may have caused the increased brilliancy.

Through the kindness of Mr. Christie, I am also enabled to give some

Aunpublished observations on the same point made at Greenwich.                                                          tube

sealed off under a pressure of 5 mm. was employed and the effect of an

air-break in the circuit was studied. Without an air-break Ha was brighter

than  H/3  by  one-fourth                                                   a break  of  one  inch  introduced  little  change,
                                                                         ;

except that the whole spectrum was fainter ; but when the break was

increased to 1"75 inches, H/3 was the brightest line. Ha being only about

two-thirds as bright. In these experiments the spark was sufficiently

strong to cross an air space of 2 '5 inches when the tube was not inter-

posed. Other experiments with a somewhat stronger spai'k confirmed

the fact thatf H/3 is increased in relative intensity when the break is

increased.

     With a spark which could cross a space of I'S in. and a break of
1'75 in. the following observation was made:

     The spai-k passed occasionally with great difficulty, sometimes giving
the usual crackle and at other times a sharp report, almost like a pistol.
The degree of ease with which the spark passed, and the appearance of the
spectrum, both varied so rapidly that it was difiicult to say if one depended

on the other. So far as could be ascertained. Ha was absent when the spark

passed with the greatest difficulty, and brightest when it passed most easily.'
     M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran * mentions that an increase of temperature

is often accompanied by a relatively greater increase in the brilliancy of
the more refrangible rays. It is often said that such an increase is a

direct consequence of the formula established by Prof. Kirchhoff. If

the absorptive power of a molecule remains the same, while the tempera-

ture is increased, it follows that the blue rays gain more quickly in inten-

sity than the red ones, but the less refrangible ones would never actually

decrease in intensity, the quantity of matter remaining the same. Now

such a decrease is observed in most cases mentioned by Lecoq de Bois-

baudran, and there is generally no reason to suppose that the quantity of

Weluminous matter has been reduced.                                                           may doubt, therefore, that the

observed differences in the spectra are in all cases regulated only by

Kirchhoff's law ; but it is a perfectly plausible hypothesis that a higher

temperature is in general accompanied by a decrease in the absorptive

hio-her tunes, stronger molecular shocks may bring out waves of smaller

leno-fcli. There are several instances of a regular increase in the relative

intensity of the blue rays which may be ascribed to this cause. The

most remarkable instance is perhaps seen in the spectrum of phospho-
retted hydrogen. If a little phosphorus is introduced into an apparatus
generating hydrogen, the flame will .show a series of bands, chiefly in the
o-reen. The spectrum gets more brilliant if the flame is cooled. This
can be done, according to Salet,^ by pressing the flame against a surface
kept cool by means of a stream of water or by surrounding the tube, at
the orifice of which the gas is lighted, by a wider tube throngh which
cold air is blown. The process of cooling the flame, according to Lecoq,^
changes the relative intensity of the bands in a perfectly regular manner.
The almost invisible least refrangible band becomes strong, and the

second band, which was weaker than the fourth, now becomes stronger.
    As another example of a similar change we may give the_ spectrum

shown to a Bnnsen burner. By charging the burner with an indifferent

gas 3 (N", HCl, CO2), the flame takes a greenish colour, and though the
spectrum is not altered, the least refrangible of the bands are increased in

intensity.

   A similar change takes place, as pointed out by Mr. Lockyer,'' in the

two sets of bands of the spectrum ascribed by Profs. Liveing and Dewar

to a combination of nitrogen and carbon. (See Report on the Spectra of

Metalloids.)

     While in the cases we have just mentioned, the jDhenomena are per-
fectly regular, and such as would flow from a general law of a more rapid
increase in the intensity of the more refrangible lines by an increase of

temperature, there are other cases where the changes are very irregular,
as in the spectrum of tin, lithium, magnesiujn, the changes in which

spectra we have already noticed. Zinc behaves in the opposite way : a rise

in temperature increases the intensity of the less refrangible blue rays.

The theory which, as we have suggested, may account for this increased

brilliancy of the more refrangible rays is in accordance with the theory
which explains the long and short lines by molecular shocks, but the

theory of molecular combinations may also account for the facts which
are now before us ; for if the low-temperature spectrum is due to a more

complicated molecule, it is quite in accordance with our ideas of molecular
vibrations that its vibrations should take place in longer periods than

those of a simpler molecule.

   We have here again two hypotheses, that of molecular shocks and

that of molecular combinations. Both explain the facts satisfactorily.

and I do not think that one of them necessarily excludes the other. I
believe, on the contrary, that a line can be drawn, and that while the

regular changes observed chiefly in band spectra may be due to one cause,

the often irregular changes in metallic spectra, where one set of lines

--disappears and another appears often ou the violet side, but sometimes

--towards the red may be due to another.

     It is often said that we must not ascribe the same phenomenon to two
different causes, when one of them is sufficient to explain it ; but tho

point at issue is whether the phenomena are the same in all cases. An

advance of science lias constantly led to the separation of phenomena
which were formerly considered to be connected together, and we believe
that the further development of the different points we have attempted
to discuss, in which different observers have strongly taken up opposite
opinions, will lead to the blending together of different views rather than
the entire elimination of one of them.

§ 3. Emission Spectra of Rats more Refrangible than H. Report hy

    W. N". Hartley, Professor of Chemistry, Eoyal College of Science for

     Ireland, Dublin.

Schule was the first to show that silver chloride when exposed to light

transmitted through a prism was blackened more by the violet rays than
by those of any other colour.^

Wollaston who, prior to Fraunhofer, perceived certain obscure rays in

the Solar Spectrum, repeated the experiments of Schule, and found that

the blackening of silver chloride extended not only over the surface occu-
pied by the violet rays, but also to an equal degree over an equally large

surface beyond the visible spectrum. ^ Shortly after the discovery of

photography. Sir John Herschel resumed this subject, and remarked that
different sensitive substances when exposed to the action of the spectrum

behave very unequally. The maximum of chemical action takes place

sometimes in one colour, sometimes in another, sometimes even outside

the spectrum, and it was always observed to extend beyond the violet.

Herschel unsuccessfully endeavoured to ascertain whether there are inac-

tive spaces in the chemical spectrum, by exposing sensitised paper pre-

pared according to the process of Mr. Fox Talbot.^

    He showed at this time that the ultra-violet rays are not completely

invisible. They produce upon, the eye a sensation which is not that of
violet nor of any other prismatic hue, but rather resembling what one

might call a lavender-grey tint. He proposed to apply the name lavender

to the obscure rays which produce the tint in question, in order to ab-

breviate the awkwardly sounding expression ultra-violet rays, and to

avoid the ambiguity attached to the term chemical rays, which in point of

fact are found in all parts of the spectrum.

    M. Edmond Becquerel was more fortunate in demonsti-ating the exist-
ence of chemically inactive rays.* He showed impressions on prepared

paper and on plates of iodised silver, indicating maxima and minima of
chemical action. Becquerel gave the name of jjhosphorogenic spectrum

to the collection of rays which show the phenomenon of phosphorescence.

This spectrum extends beyond the violet, and consists of rays identical

Stokes for a means of studying the extremely refrangible rays by means

If a spectrum be projected on to certain substances such as quinine

sulphate, tincture of turmeric, or glass coloured with uranic oxide, these

substances become luminous, for a considerable distance beyond the

region of the violet rays, and the rays thus rendered visible are always

less refrangible tlian the incideut rays. Prof. Stokes made drawings of

certain obscm-e bands which were seen in that part of the spectrum Ijing

beyond the violet, and these correspond with impressions taken on sen-

sitised paper and prepared photographic plates by M. Becquerel. He

found likewise that glass excited a considerable absorption of the more

refrangible rays, but that quartz was of all bodies the one which trans-

mitted them most easily.

By direct vision, using lenses and prisms of quartz, Prof. Helmholtz

has been able to see the obscure rays, the existence of which was proved

Aby Prof. Stokes and M. Becquerel.  very pure spectrum was observed

in such a manner that a second slit shut off all the distinctly luminous

rays from the eye of the experimenter. By receiving the rays on a screen

saturated with quinine sulphate solution, they are rendered very plainly

visible.* M. Esselbach has modified the process and made further obser-

vations.- Dr. J, "W. Draper has also repeated the experiments of

Becquerel and reproduced the ultra-violet spectrum on photographic

plates.^ This work has been continued of late years by his son, Dr.

Henry Draper of New York.

M. Mascart has examined the ultra-violet portion of the solar spectrum

by means of photography, and has given a drawing of a normal spectrum

extending beyond H.'* Making use of a Babinet's goniometer of very

perfect construction with a prism and lenses of quartz, he substituted a

photogi'aphic plate for the eye-piece. By the use of gratings traced on

glass by M. Nobert he has made measurements of the wave-length of some

of the ultra-violet solar rays as well as of the lines of cadmium, the spec-

trum of this ruetal being remarkable for the range beyond H, to which

its rays extend.

There is a regular diminution in wave-length from the solar line H,

396'7, to 221' 7, the extreme cadmium line. It was remarked that the
shortest wave-length, 221' 7, together with the longest of the visible undu-

lations, A, 760, constitutes with the intermediate vibrations a scale extend-

ing nearly two octaves. In the accompanying table the wave-length of

ultra-violet cadmium lines as measured by M. Mascart are given.

and even furtlier tlian this he has i^hotogTaphed the regions including

E, D, C, B, a, and A, together with ultra-red rays.' He used a ruled

speculum-plaue, and in certain cases a concave speculum-mirror. The

plate generally employed vras of glass ruled with 6,481 lines to the inch,

made by the beautiful machine constructed by Mr. L. M. Rutherford of

New York. The ruled surface is 1-yf o inch long and -j^'^y of an inch

wide. It appears to be unquestionably more perfect than any similar

grating made by Nobert and others. The grating being on glass gives a

bright transmitted spectrum which was generally used, the remaining

optical part of the apparatus being of glass achromatised according to the

plan of J. W. Draper. The slit was f*V in length and yj^ of an inch in

width. The jaws of the slit made of steel were provided with a micro-

meter screw for sepai-ating them, and another for placing them at an

angle so that occasionally photogTaphs were taken with the slit opened to

-^ff inch at the top and only y^-y at the bottom, so aa to obtain a diflPerent
intensity at the two edges of the spectrum. Most of the photographs

were taken from spectra of the third order, which possesses the following

advantages : first, it is dilated to such an extent as to give a long image,

and yet is not one too faint to be copied by a reasonable exposure of the

photographic plate ; and secondly, the spectrum of the second order over-

laps it lin such a way that D falls nearly upon H, and T upon 0, and

these coincidences serve to determine the true wave-length of all the rays.

In order to obtain a spectrum of uniform character for rays of all

refrangibilities, parts of the sensitised plate were protected by a series of

diaphragms during exposure for faint groups of rays by the removal of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

these at intervals the strong rays were photographed with a distinctness

which could not otherwise have been attained.

The region from Avave-length 400'0 to 435'0 only required about

1-lOththe exposure reqiiired by that from 344'0 to 351'0. In the photo-

Ggraph published in ' Nature,' the line O had 15 minutes' and  2^

minutes' exposure to a wet bromo-iodised collodion plate, and still the

former is under-exposed.

After the production of spectra which were in focus from end to end,

it was necessary to attach a scale to them by which wave-lengths might

be read.

Plate X. is a copy of Dr. Draper's photograph.

     Using as a basis the numbers given by Angstrom for the rays, D,, &4
and G, the wave-lengths of the principal rays on Dr. He;iry Draper's pho-

tograph were calculated. Taking advantage of the fact that the second

D Hspectrum overlaps the third, the ray being near of the third, and F

of the second being near O of the third, it is obvious that wdve-lengths of
three points, one at each end and one in the middle of the photograph, may
be readily ascertained. . As the rays D and b were too feeble to be easily

photographed, the following device was resorted to to indicate their

position, with regard to lines on the spectrum of the third order. In

front of the sensitised plate and close to it, were placed two very fine

steel points, one carefully adjusted to Dg of the second order, and the

other to F^ of the second order. On developing the picture after expos-

ing the plate to the ultra-violet spectrum of the third order, two sharply

defined images of the steel points were superposed on the spectrum. The

point coincident with D2 of the second order was found on Hj of the third

order, and the point 64 of the second order had impressed itself near O of
Gthe third order. The ray of the third order, the wave-length of which

is known, was impressed photographically on the collodion plate.

    By a simple calculation it was rendered evident that a given ray in the

compound H2 was of wave-length 393"01, and that another near had

the wave-length 344-46.

Dr. Draper ruled a fine scale with a dividing engine, and applied this

to his spectrum photographs in order that the wave-length of any line

could be read ofi" at once to the 10-millionth of a millimetre.

The followins: remarks concerning: M. Mascart's measurements are

worthy of record. The line L, which he regards as single is in reality
Mtriple, and does not correspond to wave-length 381'9 but to 382'1 ;
                                                                      is

Ncorrectly designated by 372'8, but it is double ; is really at 358'3 and

not at 358-0.

The spectrum above H, when compared with the region from G to H,

is marked by the presence of bolder groups of lines, the most conspicuous

of which are those between 382-0-386-0; 370-5-376-0; 362-0-365-0;

356-8-359-0; 349-0-3530. Dr. Draper's fine photographs show how

impossible it is to depict the relative intensities of lines in the spectrum

by any other means than photography, and how groups of lines even may

fail to be resolved ; in his original negative there could be readily counted

more than fifty lines in the group H.

      In fact ' The exact composition of even a 'part of the spectrum of a metal
will not he known until we have ohtained photographs of it on a large

scale.'

M. Cornu has given a description of the solar spectrum from the line

called 7i to the ray O, and has drawn a beautiful map made to the scale

of wave-lengths.' This work was intended to be a continuation of the

labours of Angstrom. The spectra were observed by photography in a

manner similar to that devised by. M. Mascart, but as the optical appai-atus

was made of glass, all rays more refrangible than O (wave-length=344-ll)

were intercepted.

In a continuation of his experiments using more perfect lenses of

quartz and Iceland spa as well as prisms of these materials, M. Cornu

has succeeded in photographing the solar spectrum as far as a line called

U (wave-length 294-84). Rays more refrangible than this are absorbed

by the earth's atmosphere. As a reflector for the ultra-violet rays,

metallic mirrors were found to be useless, therefore in order to bring solar

rays into the slit of the collimator, a right-angled prism of quartz was

used, the light being totally reflected from one side of the prism. The

image was received on a photographic plate, a dark-slide being made to

replace the eye-piece of the spectroscope.

    By taking two photographs on the same plate, one below the other,

the prism being turned to the right or to the left through a measured

arc, the sharpness of the lines and their position near the centre of the

field gives us a means of ascertaining the position of the pi"ism corre-

sponding to the minimum angle of deviation for any particular ray. On

accoimt of want of intensity in the rays, photographs are difficult to obtain

from diffraction spectra. DiSraction-gratings on glass yield spectra con-

tinuous only as far as R. Photographs of diffraction-spectra have been

taken by M. Oornu by means of a quartz grating ; the lines ruled on the
quartz numbered 60 to the millimeti'e. The photographic process em-

ployed was the ordinary one with wet collodion and a developer of feri-ous
sulphate. The collodion was salted with cadmium iodide and bromide,
there being 4 parts of the foz-mer to 1 of the latter salt. M. Cornu's
observations regarding that portion of the solar spectrum more refrangible

Hthan include the following remarkable facts.

    1. No single or isolated line is met with among the principal groups,

such as we are familiar with in the luminous portion of the spectrum, as

for instance the single lines C, D, h and F.
     2. The groups of rays are always made up of twin lines, triplets or

multiple groups, lying very close together. This occasions a certain con-

fusion which enhances the difficulty of accurately measuring their wave-
lengths. The confusion of lines is increased when diffraction-gratings are
used instead of prisms, since their dispersive power in comparison with

that of prisms decreases with the refrangibility of the rays.

    3. The greatest extent of the solar spectrum can be photographed only

in  the  spring-time  of the  year and  at  mid-day                                         at any other time the most
                                                                                         ;

refrangible rays are intercepted by the atmosphere.
    H4. Nearly all the solar rays more refrangible than are due to the

Aspectrum of iron.    photograph of the spectrum of this metal is a fairly

accurate representation of the solar rays, and may be used as a spectrum

for comparison.

     5. Without exception all these rays belong to matter which enters

into the composition of meteorites.

     The wave-lengths of the principal lines in the solar spectrum have

been measured by M. Oornu. He adopts the designation O, P, Q, R,

r and S, given by M. Mascart to indicate certain rays.

     The following numbers are the wave-lengths of the principal solar rays
determined with a diffraction- grating made by Brunner.

     The numbers are the results of five different measurements which

numbers obtained by M. Mascart.

     Comparing the spectrum of iron with the solar rays, it was found that

the incandescence of the metal caused by the action of fifty-five Bunsen's

elements was much more intense than sunlight. The lines in the

spectrum thus observed were for the most part coincident with the solar

rays L, M, N, 0, P, Q, Sg T and U; their identity was easily recognised.

The following table shows the wave-length of iron lines compared with
those in the solar spectrum. The ray E. is due to calcium, while other
important lines belong to nickel, aluminium, magnesium and titanium.

The line P cannot be recognised as belonging to any known metallic

spectrum.

used glass instead of quartz apparatus.

     Both Prof. Stokes and Dr. Miller carried on their experiments by
means of an induction coil and a Leyden jar ; the metals for the points
between which the spai'k passed being varied according to circumstances.
The rays which escaped absorption by the substance interposed in their
path were caused to pass through a quartz prism, and then focussed on a
fluorescent screen or on a photographic wet plate : the former method
being employed by Pi'of. Stokes,^ the latter by Dr. Miller.^

     ·Dr. Miller's experiments are comprised under the following heads :

     (1) The ahsorption of tJie invisible rays hy  transmission  thmigh
different media.

    a. By transmission through solids.
    1). By transmission through liquids.
    c. By transmission through gases and vapours.

     (2) The ahsorption of the invisible rays by reflection from polished

surfaces.

     (3) The photographic effects of the electric spectra of different metals

talien in air, including

a. Pare metals.       b. Alloys.

      (4) Photographic effects of electric spectra of different metals produced by
transmitting the sparhs through gases other than atmospheric air.

    The general results having reference to (1) may be stated as

follows :

     Colourless bodies which possess equal powers of transmitting the
luminous rays vary greatly in permeability to the invisible rays.

     Diactinic solids (that is to say, solids which are permeable to the
chemical rays) preserve their diactinic power both when liquefied and

when converted into vapour.

     Colourless solids which are transparent to light, but exei-t a con-
siderable absorptive effect upon the invisible rays, preserve their absorptive
power with greater or less intensity both in the liquid and the gaseous

state.

    In the pi'eparation of the various compounds for examination, much

care is stated to have been taken to employ materials in a state of purity.
Notwithstanding, in some cases there was reason to believe that some
impurity was present which could not be detected by the ordinary tests,
but which was opaque to the actinic rays. Subsequent researches by
others have pi'oved this surmise to be correct. It was found that filtration
through paper sensibly impaired the diactinicity of a solution.

     Dr. Miller states that he was unable to trace any special connec-
tion between the chemical complexity of a substance and its diactinic
power.

     As regards ' the absorption of the invisible rays by transmission through

different media,' it may be remarked that the solids examined were not

of uniform thickness, and the substances experimented on in a state of
solution were in the condition of saturation, and, therefore, not fairly

comparable one with another : nevertheless some important generalisations

were arrived at. No substance which could be conveniently employed

for prisms and lenses was found to surpass quartz in diactinicity.

    (2) ' The absorption of the invisible rays by reflexion from polished

surfaces.'

    A small polished plate of the substance under experiment was supported

at an angle of 45° opposite the vertical slit of the apparatus, and the
source of the rays was arranged so that they should be reflected in the
direction of the axis of the tube. ' It was found that no judgment of
the perfection of the reflecting power could be formed from the colour of
the metal.' For example, gold possesses the power of reflecting all the
rays, even the most refrangible, very equally, though somewhat feebly.
Next to gold ranks burnished lead, some parts of the spectrum reflected
from lead being more intense than that from gold. The spectrum
reflected from these two metals was found to be longer than that obtained
by reflection from any other metallic surface examined. The spectrum
reflected from a silver surface was characterised by a sudden cessation for
a certain distance of the image on the photographic plate ; that is to say,
in a certain portion of the spectrum the rays had been absorbed, some
more refrangible being transmitted. The reflection from steel was more
intense than that from any other surface employed, with, perhaps, the

exception of tin.

     Speculum-metal, platinum, zinc, aluminium, mercury, cadmium,
copper, and brass were also examined.

     The foregoing experiments on reflection from metallic surfaces were

undertaken in consequence of the difficulty experienced in obtaining a
spectrum, all parts of which were even approximately in focus in the
same plane. The results were not, however, considered favourable to the
substitution of a speculum for a lens.

      (3) Photographic effects of the electric spectra of different metals taken
in air.

(a) Pure Metals. Although each metal was found to have a distinc-

tive spectrum, as in the case of the ordinarily visible rays, yet it is re-

markable that no important diSerence is apparent in the less refrangible

end. The photographic lines of the air-spectrum are most marked in the

less refrangible portion, whilst the characteristic lines of the metals are

particularly evident in the more refrangible parts. The more volatile

--metals gave the most intense spectra those of bismuth, antimony,

cadmium, zinc, and magnesium being the most prominent in this respect.

A certain similarity was observed in the spectra of allied metals; this was

the case with the three last-named metals, and also in the case of iron,

cobalt, and nickel, and with bismuth and antimony, as well as with chro-

mium and manganese. In consequence of imperfections in the methods of

experimenting, ihe true relative length of the spectra was not accurately

determined.

(b) Spectra of Alloys. Dr. Miller states that 'When equal weights

of two metals are employed (tin and lead, for example, or cadmium and

lead) a compound spectrum exhibiting the lines due to both metals is

produced                                                      and  it  is  not  always  the     more  volatile  metal  that  predomi-

      (4) Photographic effects of electric spectra of different metals produced
hy transmitting the sparks through gases other than atmospheric air.

     The gases to be examined were passed tlirough a glass tube which
enclosed the electrodes ; on one side the part opposite the metal-points
was cut away and replaced by a thin piece of quartz. The genei'al results
of these experiments on the invisible rays are in harmony with those

already obtained for the visible rays by MM. Angstrom,' Alter, ^ and

Pliicker.^ They may be summed up as follows :

     1. Each gas tinges the spark of a characteristic coloui' ; but no judg-
ment can be formed from this colour of the kind of spectrum which the

gas will famish.
      2. In most cases, in addition to the lines peculiar to the metal used as

electrodes, new and special lines characteristic of the gas, if elementary,

or of its constituents, if compound, are produced. When compound

gases are employed, the special lines produced are not due to the compound

as a whole, but to its constituents.
     Prof. Stokes's experiments on the fluorescent spectra of metals and

the diactinicity of solids and solutions corroborate the results obtained by
Dr. Miller. In his method of experimenting the substance to be observed
is introduced into the solvent, and the effect on the fluorescent screen

watched as solution gradually takes place ; in this way he was enabled to

seize the most charactei'istic phase of the absorption, and registered it on
paper by naeans of a pricking instrument devised by him for the pur-

pose.

     Some interesting results were also obtained by him regarding the
Absorption of the invisible rays by Alkaloids, Glucosides, ^'c. He found

that these bodies were intensely opaque for a portion of the invisible

rays, the mode of absorption being generally highly characteristic. The

solvents used were water, dilute sulphuric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid
and ammonia: all of these being sufficiently transparent to the rays under
examination, to answer the purpose. The effect of acids and alkalies on

the glucosides presented one uniform feature : when a previously neutral
sokxtion was rendered alkaline the absorption began somewhat earlier,
when rendered acid somewhat later. In the case of quinine and the other
bases observed, with one exception, the absorption, if altered at all, was
changed in an opposite manner to that in the case of the glucosides when
the base is set free by ammonia. Bands of absorption also appeared
when neutral substances were examined, e.g., in the case of coumarine
and paranaphthaline.

      In addition to experimenting on several minerals as to their trans-
parency for the rays which give rise to fluorescence. Prof. Stokes exa-
mined them also for the property of fluorescence itself. His researches

in this direction were rewarded by some interesting results. He found

--that adularia exhibits a pair of bluish dots the images of the tips of the
--electrodes when the rays of highest refrangibility are focussed on it ; as

the same phenomenon was observed with colourless felspas from different
localities, it is doubtless a property of silicate of alumina and potash.
The other case of interest relates to a particular variety of fluor-spa
found at Alston Moor. The specimen, when exposed to the spark passing

between aluminium-points, in addition to the usual blue fluorescence

exhibited a reddish colour, extending not nearly so far into the cry-
stal; this reddish fluorescence was ascertained to be produced by the
rays of extreme refrangibility. Prof. Stokes found that as the distance

between the electrodes was diminished the reddish fluorescence appeai-ed
to increase. Similar experiments with this crystal lead him to the con-
clusion that the proportion of rays of extremely high refrangibility is

decidedly greater for the spark at the contact-breaker than for the secondary

discharge.

                                                              the electrodes are

made to nearly touch, and the spark passes with little noise, a new set of

strong lines make their appearance in the invisible region of moderate

refrangibility. Although in this mode of discharge the jar has not much

influence, the lines in question are better seen when it is suppressed

altogether. Under these circumstances the visible discharge is very in-

significant, but a very considerable effect is produced in the invisible

region.

    From the publication of the papers just referred to until the year
1874, we find nothing recorded which materially adds to our know-
ledge of the more refrangible i*ays of the ultra-violet spectrum. About

this time M. J. L. Soret constructed a spectroscope provided with a
fluorescent eyepiece.^ The modification introduced consists essentially

in placing a transparent and fluorescent substance at the focus of

the object-glass, and, in order to view the spectrum to advantage,

having an eyepiece inclined to the axis of the telescope. By means

of this spectroscope (still further slightly modified) M. Soret ex-

amined the solar spectrum at dififerent altitudes,^ He found that the

intetisity of the ultra-violet spectrum is notably greater at high eleva-

tions than at the sea-level, but that the spectrum does not extend

further. Similar observations were made by Janssen in India : he re-
marked that at a great elevation it was possible to distinguish by direct

vision ultra-violet rays, which, with the same instrument, could not

be distinguished at the level of the sea. M. Soret draws the inference

that it is the sun's atmosphere, and not that of the earth, which absorbs

the solar rays of a smaller wave-length, a conclusion which is, he says,

already admitted by some savants, and which is confirmed by the fact

that the light emitted by the edge of the sun exerts a less energetic

chemical action than that emanating from the centre. Our atmosphere

exerts a twofold absorbing action : the one, due to the vapour of water
and to gaseous substances, is elective and gives rise to atmospheric

bands ; the other is continuous, and acts with an increasing energy the
more refrangible the rays. The latter is pi'obably due to solid or liquid

particles in suspension in the air, for on the sky becoming clouded the

ultra-violet rays lose much of their intensity, and when the sun is near

the horizon they disappear altogether.

    By the publication by M. Soret in 1878, of the results of further in-

vestigations, our knowledge of the extremely refrangible rays was some-

what advanced. He examined many of the substances previously

investigated by Professors Stokes and Miller, and also a considerable
number of other bodies. As, however, in most cases the substances

employed had not been specially prepared, the conclusions to be dz'awn

--from the results were in consequence necessarily limited. Apparatus

employed: a Ruhmkorff's coil, a magneto-electric machine, and four
Leyden jars were so arranged as to give a spark 15 centimetres long.
The spectroscope with a fluorescent eyepiece was employed in this and
subsequent investigations of a similar nature.

                                        Transparency of Quartz, Sfc.

     The observation by Prof. Stokes, that quartz when beyond a certain
thickness does not transmit the extreme rays was confirmed, a gradual

absorption being found to take place as the thickness increased ; he also

found that a prism of Iceland-spa absorbs the very extreme rays. From

a comparison of the transparency of quartz and water, the conclusion was

arrived at that ' the coefficient of extinction for the rays of the refrangi-
bility of the ray 32 is feebler for quartz than for water ; but for the rays

27-31 this coefficient is stronger for quartz.' It was ascertained that the
transparency of solutions filtered through paper was not impaired pro-
vided the paper had been previously washed with water containing a little
hydrochloric acid, and then with pure water.

     If the thickness of the layer through which the rays have to pass be
increased, the very refrangible rays are more and more intercepted ; but

the rate of diminution varies much with diSerent substances. Chromates

and nitrates were observed to cause absorption bands in the ultra-violet
region. The sulphates of didymium and cerium, and commercial ammonia
were also found to occasion absorption bands, that in the case of ammonia
being, however, due to some impurity ordinarily present in ammonia de-
rived from gas- liquor.

    MM. J. L. Soret and A. A.. Rilliet have since examined the ultra-

violet absorption-spectra of the ethereal nitrates and nitrites with the view
to ascertain whether these substances behave in the same way as metallic
nitrates and nitrites.'

     The nitrates of ethyl, butyl, and amyl were found to absorb energeti-

cally the ultra-violet rays ; but they did not produce the characteristic

absorption-bands observable in the case of the metallic nitrates. The
ethereal nitrates are, however, more transparent than the metallic niti'ates
for the rays 12-14, but less so for 17-20, being again more transparent
for the extreme rays. The vapours of the ethereal nitrates exhibit con-
siderable absorptive power even at the ordinary temperatures.

     Nitrites of amyl and ethyl absorb energetically the ultra-violet rays.

HSix bands, about equidistant, are apparent between and R. The vapours

give the same bands. The alkaline nitrites, although veiy absorbent for

this part of the spectrum, do not give the same absorption-bands.

    An examination of the absorption-spectra of the bases in gadolinite by

means of the solar rays, an Iceland spa prism being used, has led ]\I.
Soret to the conclusion that some of the bands in the ultra-violet region
are not due to yttrium, erbium, or terbium, but to the new base dis-
covered by Delafontaiue.'^ In a subsequent communication on the
absorption-spectra of didymium and some other substances obtained from

samarskite,^ a comparison is given between a chloride of didymium from
samarskite, and one obtained from a difierent source. The former ex-
hibited difierences, supposed to be due to the presence of the new earth
in small quantity. Further on in the same volume (page 521) we find

Xsome comments on the identity of the earth called by M. Soret, holnaium

by M. Cleve, and philippium by MM. Delafontaine and Marignac.

      With the view to ascertain whether the centre of the eye is trans-
 pai'ent to the rays of extreme refrangibility of the induction spark, M.
 Soret has made experiments on the eye of the bullock, the calf, and the

sheep. He finds that the limit of transparency for the aqueous and

U =vitreoas humours, with a thickness of one centimetre, is the ray (/\

 294-8, Cornu) ; with a thickness of 2-3 millimetres 16-20 (cd) are inter-
 cepted, but 22-24 are transmitted: i.e. there is an intermediate absorption

or absorption-band. A diagram is given showing the maximum trans-

parency for different thicknesses.' As it appeared probable that the
 absorption was due to albuminoids contained in the humours, the
 curve due to white of egg was examined ; it is shown in the dia-
gram. These two curves present considerable analogy in form, but the

absorption-band of the latter is displaced in the direction of the less

refrangible end of the spectrum. Defibrinized blood also gives an
absorption-band similar to that of white of egg. The cornea and the
 crystalline are more absorbent than the aqueous and vitreous humours.
The thinnest possible slice of the crystalline cuts off the rays of greatest
refrangibility. The curve due to the crystalline diluted with water
approached more nearly to that of white of egg than to that of aqueous

humour. The eye of living man is certainly more transparent for these

rays ; but this is due in all probability to its smaller dimensions. The
comparison is also made more difficult by the rapidity with which the

tissues alter after death.

     In any case it appears probable that the eye as a whole absorbs all the
rays more refrangible than U, i.e. the most refrangible ray of the fluores-

cent solar spectrum.

     M. Cornu, when determining the wave-lengths of the solar spectrum,
in order to construct a map, made some object-glasses which were

achromatized by using a converging lens of quartz, and a diverging lens

of Iceland spa.- There is not, however, the proper relation between
the dispersion of these two substances to give a very perfect achro-
matism, and in addition Iceland spa absorbs somewhat energetically
the most refrangible vnjs. M. Cornu discovered a substance at least
as transparent as quartz, and which has a law of dispersion so well in

harmony with that of quartz that we are enabled to obtain a system

of lenses of which the achromatism is nearly perfect. This substance

is a colourless variety of fluor spa from Switzerland. With this

arrangement he obtained, on one plate, with satisfactory sharpness
of definition, the spectrum of all the photographic rays from the

three blue rays of zinc to the ray No. 32 of aluminium.^ It may be

pointed out that the great transparency of fluor-spa for the rays of
highest refrangibility had previously been referred to by Professors

Stokes, Miller, Hartley, and Huntington. As it crystallises in the
tesseral system it might probably be used with advantage in special

researches to avoid double refraction.

    By means of the apparatus described above, M. Cornu has carried out

some important investigations regarding the limit of the ultra-violet rays
of the solar spectrum at different elevations.''

    He finds that the limit of the solar spectrum varies with the state

exposure ; but, if the finest days be chosen, and a collodion of constant

composition be used, the length of the exposure being always the same,

then comparable series are obtained. For example

These groups are developed when examined either by photography >

order of brilliancy being 30, 32, 31.

     The following experiments demonstrate that the intensity of the
extreme rays is modified considerably by atmospheric absorption in the

manner indicated by the formula.
     "With a spectroscope (comprised of one prism and an object-glass)

focussing at six metres, the ray 32 was invisible, the feeblest ray, 31, being

still quite distinct. On adding a collimator, so as to reduce the distance

to l-50m., the ray 32 again became visible, notwithstanding the absorption

due to the additional object-glass.

To complete the demonstration, M. Cornu had a spectroscope con-

structed focussing at 0-25m. With this apparatus the ray 32 had a

superior intensity to ray 30 ; so that the order became 32, 30, 31. Still

not satisfied, he arranged, between the collimator and the prism of

the spectroscope, a tube four metres long, closed at its two extremities

Whenby flnor spa.   the tube is full of air no trace of 32 is visible, but

if a vacuum be gradually made, 31 gains in intensity, 32 soon appears,
and finally surpasses in intensity 31. As the air is readmitted the phe-

nomena repeat themselves in inverse order.^

In order to put this property of the atmosphere to the test of further

direct experiment, M. Cornu carried out a series of experiments of great

interest in the Alps. The following are the results of these experiments,

which were made under particularly favourable conditions :

     The conditions of the foregoing experiment were obviously more

favourable to the coiTect determination of the influence of different
thicknesses of atmosphere in absorbing the extreme rays than were those

previously made at low levels. It would appear, then, that the increase

of length expressed in wave-lengths is about one-millionth of a milli-

metre for 900m. within the limits experimented on by M. Cornu.
     Notwithstanding the failure on the part of Dr. Miller to trace any

special connection between the chemical complexity of a substance and
its diactinic power, Mr. "W. N. Hartley, in the year 1872, having at his
disposal the apparatus which had been used by Dr. Miller, determined to
repeat, in a more complete and comprehensive manner, the experiments

which had been made by that investigator. He was led to this determi-

nation by the consideration that all the characteristic physical properties
of organic substances are dependent on their molecular constitution ; and
he inferred that if a large number of bodies of similar constitution were

examined, many of which would be metaraeric substances, such as the

ethereal salts of the organic acids and homologous series of the normal
alcohols and acids, evidence might be forthcoming of the influence of
impurities and the variations in the absorption of the invisible rays

caused by each increment of CH2 in the molecule. In the carrying out

of this research, Mr. A. K. Huntington was associated with Mr. Hartley
their joint labours ai'e recorded in the ' Phil. Trans.' part I., 1870, and in
the ' Proc. Roy. Society,' 1879.

     The relative absorptive power not being affected by the physical
condition of matter (Miller), the inconvenience of making observations on
equal volumes of organic substances in a state of vapour was avoided, it

being easy to arrive at the maximum absorption due to a molecule of a

substance by taking into account its specific volume in the liquid state,
and making the layer of liquid proportionally thick, or by dissolving the

substances in solvents of known transparency in the ratio of their mole-

cular weights.

                                    The method of experimenting.

     After careful trial of the methods of studying the ultra-violet rays,
preference was given to the photographic method. Rays which cause a
very indistinct eSect, or no effect at all, on a fluorescence screen, will on

Aa properly prepared photographic plate produce a satisfactory image.

piece of uranium glass is extremely useful in focussing ; a strip of glass
coated with gelatine in the solution of which some aesculine has been
dissolved, answers equally well. To observe the visible and ordinarily
invisible rays simultaneously by reflected light, a piece of paper steeped

in a solution of eesculine, to which a little ammonia has been added may

be employed.

     In the course of the investigation it was found necessary to modify in

many important details the original apparatus. In order to prevent the

ignition of volatile liquids and to better concentrate the light on the slit,
the liquids under examination were placed at the back of the slit, in a

Abox forming a prolongation of the collimator tube. means of exhausting

vaponrs which might become diffused in the tube was provided. The

metal employed to pi-oduce the spectrum has varied according to circum-

stances, but for most purposes nickel was preferred. In many cases,

especially where absorption-bands occur, it is desirable to photograph

with the slit wide open ; in this way a continuous and more uniform

spectrum is obtained. Wet-plate photography did not give satisfactory

results ; the more refrangible end of the spectrum either not photograph-
ing or being very weak, and in a small room the ozone generated by the

electric discharge causes a deposit of silver on the plate directly the de-

plates wei'e found to be the most generally serviceable. The lines of

zinc, cadmium, and aluminium were employed to define the region of

absorption.

     After examining a very large number of specially purified substances,
and recording the results by diagrams which accompany the report, the

following generalisations were arrived at

     (1) The normal alcohols of the series ,, Ha^.i OH, are remarkable

for transparency to the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, pure methylic

alcohol being nearly as much so as water.

     (2) The normal fatty acids exhibit a greater absorption of the more
refrangible rays of the ultra-violet spectrum than the normal alcohols

containing the same number of carbon atoms.
     (3) There is an increased absorption of the more refrangible rays

corresponding to each increment of CH2 in the molecule of the alcohols

and acids.
     (4) Like the alcohols and acids, the ethereal salts derived fi'om them

are highly transparent to the ultra-violet rays, and do not exhibit absorp-

tion-bands.

             Exatninatwn of Suhstances containing the Benzene Nucleus.

      In the examination of substances represented by a formula containing
a closed chain of carbon atoms doubly linked together, it was shown that
all such bodies are highly adiactinic, the hydrocarbons being least so.
Prof. Stokes has pointed out that one of these substances, salicine (a
glucoside of saligenin) during the process of dilution causes an absorption-
band in the spectrum of the transmitted rays. It was thought worth
while to examine allied substances, such as phenol, salicylic acid, etc., and
ascertain whether they also produce absorption-spectra. The following
points of interest were made apparent by the results of this examination
of benzene and its derivatives :

   --(1) Benzene and the hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, and amines

derived therefrom, are remarkable first, for their powerful absorption

of the most refi-angible rays ; secondly, for the absorption-bands made
visible by dissolving them in water or alcohol ; and thirdly, for the

extraordinary intensity of these absorption-bands even in very dilute

solutions.

      (2) Isomeric bodies containing the benzene nucleus exhibit widely
different spectra, inasmuch as their absorption-bands vary in position and.

in intensity.

     (3) The photographic absorption-spectra can be employed as a means
of identifying organic substances, and as a most delicate test of their
purity. The curves obtained by co-ordinating the extent of dilution, or
in other words the quantity of substance, with the position of the rays of
314 REPORT-- 1880.

tlie spectrum transmitted by the solution, form a strongly marked and
highly characteristic feature of very many substances.

    In consequence of the satisfactory results which they had obtained,

Messrs. Hartley and Huntington thought it worth while to make a

special examination of essential oils.' In addition to the scientific interest

which these bodies possess, many have considerable commercial value,

and consequently are subject to adulteration.

    It is now well known that essential oils consist for the most part of
isomeric hydrocarbons, which may be divided into three polymeric

--groups, having the composition represented by the formulae CigHig
--^15ll24 C20H32.

    To the first class belong the hydrocarbons derived from turpentine,

orange, nutmeg, myrtle, and others ; the second group includes the

hydrocarbons from rosewood, cubebs, calumus, cascarilla, patchouli, and

cloves. The third group is represented by colophene. Though of

unknown constitution, these bodies exhibit a close relationship to benzene

derivatives.

    The report on this investigation contains twenty-five diagrams having

reference to about fifty specimens which had been examined. In the

examination of the following bodies no absorption- bands were discovered,

but the absorption of the extreme ultra-violet rays was found to be

greater the higher the number of carbon atoms in the molecule

australene, terebene,^ terebenthene, hesperidene, cajputene, dihydrate,

the oils of lign aloes, Indian geranium, santal wood, cedrat, birch bark,

juniper, rosemary, rosewood, lavender, vitivert, turpentine, cubebs,

patchouli, citronella, elder, melaleuca ericifolia, and cedar wood, the

hydrocarbons from cedrat, nutmeg, carraway, and menthole, otto of rose,

and otto of citron.

    The presence of cymene in small quantity was indicated by absorption-

bands in the case of the hydrocarbons from thyme, lemon, and nutmeg,

the blue oil from patchouli, and in one specimen of carraway hydrocarbon.

    The following bodies cause powerful absorption-bands, and are, there

can be but small doubt, composed largely of some benzene derivative

oils of bay, thyme, peppermint, bergamot, cloves, aniseed, and cassia,

carvole, myristicol, and otto of pimento. It is generally admitted that

OHthe oils of bay, pimento, and cloves contain eugenol, CgHg .                                                                . OCH3 .

                           ;

CgHg . OH3 . O3H7. Some other oils, such as bergamot and oil of pepper-

mint, as likewise the bodies menthole, carvole, and myristicol, have an

unknown constitution. The three latter substances are said to be iso-

Americ'                            special interest is attached to their examination, since the

character of the spectra they transmit appears to show that the nucleus

of  menthole is                    a  terpene                                     while  the  benzene  ring  is   the  inner  basis  of
                                                                               ;

carvole and myristicol. An examination of the absorption-spectrum of

myristicol throws further light on the nature of this substance. On

reference to the diagram, we find that the absorption-band is not well-

defined, and that a comparatively small amount of dilution has sufficed to

eliminate it. Now these are the characteristics of an absorption-spectrum

due to a mixture of two substances, one of which only is capable of causing
an intermediate absorption.

     The refraction-equivalent of myristicol' agrees well with numbers

characteristic of compounds of the aromatic series. It may be inferred

from these facts taken together that this substance is composed largely,

but not wholly of some benzene derivative.

The refraction-equivalent of carvole is also abnormal, like that of

bodies of the aromatic series. Its absorptive power is remarkable, it still

being very considerable even when the substance is diluted to 1 in 300,000 ;

whereas the absorption-band in the case of myristicol has practically

disappeared at about 1 in 20,000. Similarly bergamot may be shown to

be a mixture of a terpene with a benzene derivative, and oil of peppermint

to be composed entirely, or nearly so, of a benzene derivative.

1. Terpenes, with the composi-

tion CioHjg, possess in a high de-
gree the power of absorbing the

ultra-violet rays of the spectrum,

though they are inferior in this re-

spect to benzene and its derivatives.

2. Terpenes, with the compo-

sition C15H24, have a greatly in-

creased absorptive power.

3. Neither the terpenes them-

selves, nor their oxides nor their

hydrates, exhibit absorption-bands

under any circumstances when

pure, but always transmit continu-

ous spectra.

4. Isomeric terpenes transmit

spectra which generally differ from

one another in length, or show

variations on the substance being

diluted.

5. The process of diluting with

alcohol enables the presence of

bodies of the aromatic series to be

detected in essential oils ; and even
in some cases the amount of these

substances present may be approxi-

mately determined.

of absorption.

The results so far obtained by Professors Hartley and Huntington

naturally led to the consideration whether substances with two doubly-

linked adjacent carbon atoms exhibit any bands in their absorption-

spectra, and other similar questions. These points have been independently

investigated by Prof. Hartley, since his appointment to the Royal College

of Science, Dublin.'*

316 EEPORT-- 1880.

As representatives of bodies with two doubly-linked adjacent atoms,

ethylene, amylene, and allyl-alcohol were examined : no absorption-bands
were seen. To ascertain tbe effect of treble-linking, two carbon atoms,

acetylene and valerylene, were examined : again, no absorption-bands

were apparent.

     It appears probable then that in no case do carbon atoms arranged in

Han open chain give rise to absorption- bands. The arrangement of the

and O atoms has not been found to affect the question.

With hydrocarbons containing at least six atoms of caibon and their

derivatives there are three possible arrangements which admit of the

carbon atoms forming a closed chain :

(1) Three pairs of carbon atoms may be doubly-linked, as is assumed

to be the case in benzene  ;

(2)       Two pairs may be doubly-linked
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

(3) The six atoms may be singly-linked.

There are reasons for representing oil of                                                                                                                                               turpentine  and  terebene  as

having two pairs of carbon atoms donbly-linked, and their nucleus formed

by a closed chain, which includes these two pairs of atoms. These bodies

exhibit no absorption-bands, from which Prof. Hartley concludes that

bodies containing a closed chain of carbon atoms, in which only two pairs

are doubly-linked, do not cause intermediate absorption. Again, the

constitutional formula of camphor may be based on a closed chain of

carbon atoms. It is found to be more diactinic than the terpenes, from

which it may be inferred that its atoms are less compactly united : a

state consistent with the theory of a singly-linked closed chain of atoms.

Camphoric acid agrees with camphor in this respect. From the foregoing

considerations it is surmised that no molecular arrangement of carbon

atoms causes selective absorption, unless three pairs are doubly-linked

together in a closed chain.

The absorption-spectra of condensed benzene nuclei are next con-

sidered.

It was expected, from the generally accepted views as to the con-

stitution of naphthalene and anthracene, that these substances would

cause a larger number of absorption-bands than benzene, and that the

Abands would have greater intensity.    solution of naphthalene, however,

of 1 in 60,000 shows four absorption-bands, whereas six bands of ben-

zene, apparent at a dilution of between 1 in 700-800, have been entirely

eliminated at 1 in 2500. Therefore, although the number of bands is

not increased, the absorptive power is very considerably greater in the

case of naphthalene.

Phenanthren, which is supposed to contain three benzene rings

arranged as follows, shows three strong absorption-bands with a solution

containing one in 4000 :

diluted to 1 in 50 millions with acetic acid still shows considerable absorp-
tion. Hydrocyanic is very diactinic ; cyanuric acid is not, and Prof.
Hartley accordingly assigns to it the formula

                                           HO

     It has been shown that cymene has a well-defined absorption-spectrum,

and according to Dr. Armstrong this substance forms a part of orange

cil, French turpentine, and Russian turpentine. On examining specimens

received from Dr. Armstrong, no cymene could be detected in the first
two, and less than 4 per cent, in the last. The inference is, therefore,
that the cymene found by Dr. Armstrong was formed by the chemical

treatment to which these substances were subjected in his investigation.

    Council on Patent Legislation.

This Committee begs leave to report that with the exception of the

introduction of a Bill on the Patent Law by Mr. Anderson, Mr. Alexander

Brown, Mr. Hinde Palmer, and Mr. Broadhurst, which. Bill was not pro-
ceeded with, there has been, so far as they are aware, no attempt at
legislation on the subject. The Committee have spent the five pounds

granted to them, and request that they may be reappointed, and that a
sum of five pounds be granted to them.

Prelirninary Report of the Covimittee, consisting of Professor Leone
   Levi (Secretary), Mr. Stephen Bourne, Mr. Brittain, Dr. Neilson
   Hancock, Professor Jevons, and Mr. Fellows, appointed for the
   purpose of inquiring into the present appropriation of tvages
   and sources of income, and considering hotv far it is consonant
   with the economic progress of the people of the United Kingdom.

Whilst the attention of economists and financiers has been directed to
ascertain tbe rate of increase of wealth and capital in the United King-
dom, the corresponding important subject of the mode of its expenditure
or the manner of appropriation of wages and other sources of income, has
not been subjected to sufficient analysis, nor have its economic bearings

been sufficiently appreciated. What proportion of the national income is

yearly used as capital, what proportion of capital is devoted to productive

or unproductive purposes, how far, in short, is the present method of

appropriation consonant with the economic progress of the people of the

United Kingdom ; these are questions of great moment, worthy of care-

ful attention.

     The national income consists of the total amount of utilities produced,
less those wasted within the year, from the increment of capital, from land
and sea, from industry and manufactures, fi'om commerce and navigation.
The total gross receipts of every individual cannot be taken as the total
national income. The income of the professional classes, including per-
sons engaged in tlie general and local government, in the defence of the
country, in the learned professions, or in literature, art, and science, and
the income of persons engaged in entertaining and performing personal
offices for man, as domestic servants, are not independent incomes. Such
persons receive what the producers of wealth yearly expend. In like
manner, the total gross expenditure of every individual cannot be taken
as the sum total of the national expenditure, inasmuch as a large portion
         ON THE APPROPRIATION OF WAGES, ETC.                                                        319

of what is paid away only passes from hand to hand, and is not really ex-

pended. What is expended is the amount devoted to the production of

tbe articles consumed, and the amount paid to foreign countries for com-

modities imported, account being taken of the value of commodities re-
maining in existence, and for the use of which only a certain percentage

should be annually charged. The expenditure for education consists, not
in the salaries of teachers and other officers, but in the cost of buildings,
and materials used for purposes of instruction, together with the con-
sumption of the staff employed. The expenditure for amusements does

not consist in the remuneration of artists, save, as before, the cost of that
which they consume, but in the cost of buildings, appliances, and mate-

rials. Of the expenditure for alcoholic liquors a large portion remains in
the hands of distributors and goes to the State for revenue. Viewed in
this light the national balance-sheet will have on the one side the total
value of utilities produced, on the other the total amount of expenditure

of such utilities, the balance being the surplus left for accumulation, or

the amount of loss of national capital.

     The national income calculated in money value arises from the follow-

ing principal sources, viz. :

Land,                                                        Ironworks,  Railways,  Industry,

Houses,                                                      Quarries,   Canals,    Manufactures,

Mines,                                                       Fisheries,  Shipping,  Commerce,

Receipts for services from foreign countries,

           Receipts from foreign and colonial investments, &c., &c.
     In all cases the income from these different sources must be estimated
by the annual value of products of existing properties, annual value of
properties newly produced, and total amount of utilities created by dis-
tribution, after all expenses are deducted.

    The national expenditure may be distributed as follows :

State expenditure, viz. : Interest of public debt, civil service, mili-
     tary and naval expenditure, &c.

Local expenditure : Care of the poor, health, roads, &c.

Productive industry for home consumption.

                   ,, ,, export.

     Religion, charity, education, science, and art.
     Public works of utility, viz. : Railways, canals, &c., &c.
     Investments in colonies and foreign countries.
The personal expenditure should be classified as follows :

      Articles of food.

        ,, drink.
Clothing.

House I'ent.

Household furniture.

Fire and light.

Education, Church, Charity.
Travelling and amusements.
Domestic service.

Luxuries                                                     Tobacco, ornaments, dogs, and horses.
                                                          :

Taxes.

     The data available for the proposed inquiry are doubtless very in-
sufficient, nevertheless much authentic information is available.

    As regards income, the Inland Revenue Commissioners supply the
annual amount of property assessed to income and property tax. Although
320 REPORT-- 1880.

the ascertainment of the total national income is a question apart from

the manner in which the different classes of the community partici-

pate in the same, the income-tax returns of the amount assessed to each

Dindividual under Schedules & E, and of the aggregate of all the assess-
ments under Schedules A, B, & C, will be found as great helps in the cal-

culation ; especially in any attempt to consider the relation of expenditure

to income among the different classes of the community. From the

reports of the Local Government Board we have the total value of real

property subject to local taxation. The Miscellaneous Statistics give the
rates of wages in manufactures and trades. From the Agricultural

Statistics we have the materials for ascertaining the quantities of agri-

cultural products ; from the Board of Trade tables the tonnage of ship-

ping annually built. The Mineral Statistics give the quantities of coal,

iron, and other metals produced. As regards Expenditure, the Board of

Trade tables give the quantities and values of articles of food and clothing

imported and consumed. But no information is given in public docu-

ments of the quantities and value of the same produced and consumed at

home, and it will have to be obtained from other sources. The Statistics

of Coal, the accounts of Water and Gas companies, and the Accounts of

the House Tax, supply information regarding the expenditure on house,

fire, light, &c. The railway accounts give the amount expended in

travelling. Special information would be needed on the expenditure on

theatres and  amusements                                                            in newspapers,  reviews,  tracts,  and  books.
                                                                                 ;

And still greater difiBculty may be found in estimating the expenditure

in articles of consumption, arising from the additional value imparted

Ato such articles by artificial and other circumstances.                                                      large item of

national expenditure consists in labour productively or unproductively

employed. In its great population the United Kingdom possesses a vast

source of wealth, and any portion of the population remaining idle or

unproductive must be considered as so much loss of national wealth.

The national income of the United Kingdom is considerable in amount,

probably exceeding one thousand millions a year, but its economic value

depends on the mode of its appropriation, and any information illustrative

of the relation between income and expenditure among the different
classes of the community would be of great value. No sharp division,

it is true, exists between the upper, middle, and labouring classes ; never-

theless there are ample data to assist in the inquiry. Considerable

advantage, the Committee thinks, would be derived by the comparison of

the personal expenditure in different countries, gi'eatly affected though it

is by the difference of temperature and the habits of the people. Are the

people of England less thrifty than the people of other countries ? Is

the amount of national saving in the United Kingdom less than might

be expected ? Many economic and social problems depend for their

·solution on the mode in which wages and other sources of income are

appropriated, and your Committee ventures to solicit its reappointment

with a view of instituting the necessary inquiries, and making a full and

exhaustive report on the whole subject.

                            I. Introduction.

The questions, both of interpolation and quadrature, will be considered,

for the purposes of this report, chiefly with reference to the two following

cases :

(a) Where a definite number of observations is given, and no inter-

      mediate observations are procurable. This is the case with most

         records of isolated or discontinuous observations, and witli time

         observations.

(b) Where a curve is mechanically or graphically given, either actually

         or implicitly, so that ordinates can be taken at pleasure, while

         the analytical expression of the curve is either unknown or not

             available. This is the case with the graphical record of con-

           tinuous observations, and with the calculation of areas and mo-
            ments in engineers' work, and in naval architecture.

    When any varying quantity, or function, is tabulated, the table gives

the value of the function corresponding to certain given values of the

subject of the function. The values of the subjects are termed the

argumenis of the table : the corresponding values of the function are
termed the entries. Interpolation is the problem of finding the value of
the entry corresponding to an argument not actually given in the

table, but usually intermediate to the extreme arguments. When the

form of the function is absolutely unknown, except from the definite values

tabulated, interpolation is essentially an indeterminate problem.

    When the form of tlie function is known analytically, and can be used

for the purpose of deteimining the intermediate value or values required,

the problem becomes determinate, but the work is then rather that of
com]pufation than of interpolation. This is equally true whether the
computation be direct, and independent of the table, or whether the tabu-

lated values be used to facilitate the computation of those not tabulated.

--The latter case, under a slight change of aspect, is usually included in

the term interpolation namely, interpolation by means of the known

properties of the particular function tabulated. This is not included
in the general problem of interpolation, which is the object of this

rejiort.

     The method of quadratures is usually understood to mean the inte-
gration of a function by the use of certain definite values of it. The
geometrical expression of this is the quadrature of an area by means of

--its ordinates. There are two principal and distinct cases of this one

where the function or curve is only known for certain definite values or

ordinates, and not intermediately, and the other where the function or
curve, although not analytically given, so that the integral calculus can

be applied to it directly, is or may be known at any selected point or

ordinate whatever. The first case has indeterminateness of the same
order as the corresponding problem of interpolation : the second presents
itself in the case of curves actually drawn or otherwise continuously
indicated, and practically also where the function, although given in
analytical form, is not the differential coefficient of a function which can

--be directly computed ; and this second case has, in itself, nothing inde-

terminate.
     Interpolation has also to be considered with reference to differential

coefficients as well as to the function, and also with reference to maxima
or minima either of the tabulated function or the argument.

     Quadrature also has to be applied to moments as well as to simple

integrals. Multiple integrals have also to be considered, but, like simple
integrals, always between constant limits. The principal types of these
are, in addition to the simple integral,

                         /: y dx

                      the moments / ^ xy dx

II. Interpolation et Known Properties of the Particular Fitnction.
                                 Use of Ta\lor's Theorem.

     The calculus of finite differences is of such general and easy appli-
cation that its nse has sometimes superseded other methods which are

preferable in particular cases. This is especially true of the ordinary
logarithmic tables, including those of circular functions. "Where the

first difference is constant, or nearly so, it is sufficient to use proportional

parts ; but when the second and third differences have to be taken into
account, it is frequently prefei-able to use the properties dependent on the
form of 1;he function. The advantage of this is very marked in the in-
verse use of the table, where the argument has to be found from the

entry.

    The formulpe required may in some cases be obtained by algebraical

transfonnation of the function ; but a more general method is afforded
by the nse of Taylor's theorem in the following form :

     Let y ^= fxhe the nearest tabular entry, and let

                         ± = +y I (x(j> h)

be the interpolation required : / and h, or, often preferably, log I and log h,
have to be determined in terms of one another and of (p.

recently printed by the Association, because in these the functions

tabulated are not mere integrals, having simple differential coefficients,

bat are complicated functions, of which the differential coefficients are
= Vstill more complicated. Nevertheless, whenever A                                                     --(1 sin^6» sin^^)

is known or discoverable, the formulas of this article may still be of use

for interpolating to F^ and E^.

    These, and other methods of interpolation derived from the properties

of the function itself, are of especial advantage at those parts of a table
where the rate of change of value of the function differs widely from that
of the argument. Immediate examples of this are afforded by the tables

of logarithmic sines and tangents for small angles. In these and many

similar cases the general methods of interpolation, dependent upon finite

differences, are practically useless. It should not be forgotten that there

--are two kinds of difficulty met with in certain of those cases one in

which a very small change in the argument corresponds to a very great

--change in the entry, which introduces actual indeterminateness into the

attempt to interpolate to the latter and another where the amounts of

change fairly correspond, but, the argument varying uniformly, the rate

of change of the entry varies rapidly. Each case has its converse. An

example of the former is to be found in the attempt to determine a small

--angle from its cosine in which case accuracy is impossible ; an example

of the second is to be found in the problem of finding the logarithmic sine

or tangent of a small angle, in which the only difficulty is the arithmetical

one arising out of the particular system of tabulation in common use

that is to say, a difficulty arising from our having selected, for reasons of
a general character, a plan of tabulation not suited to the work to be done

in the particular case.f

III. Genekal Considerations Relating to the Application of Finite
                   DiFFEKENCES TO INTERPOLATION AND QUADRATURE.

    When all that is known of a fanction is, that it takes certain definite

values for corresponding definite values of the independent variable,
separated by finite intervals, the function itself, and consequently all its

    * Avery full account of this method, with copious examples, is given by Legendre
under the title ' Methodes diverses pour faciliter I'lnterpolation des grandes Tables
trigonomt^triques ' in the Cunnaissance des 'Iemj)S for 1817, p. 302. The formulfe for

logarithms were first given, to one term only, by Dodson, in his ' Antilogarithmic
Canon,' dated 1742. The second is also given by Legendre, ' Fonctions Elliptiques,'
vol. ii. p. 13. Several other examples will be found in the author's memoir on
' ElUptic and Ultra-elliptic Integrals,' mil. Trans, vol. 152 (1862) pp. 421-427. See

also Legendre, op. cit. pp. 34, 61, 62.
     t The difficulty in the former example is inherent, and therefore insuperable. In

the latter example it is met by using a table of natural sines or tangents, and finding
the logarithm of the interpolated value, or else by an artifice such as the formation

of special tables of log ^' or of log-^^" ^. These are called Delambre's tables ; but

              sin x              X

they were given long before Delambre's time by John Newton, in his THgonotnetHa

intermediate values, are siraply and absolutely indeterminate. If all

that is known of a curve is that it passes through n equidistant points,

nothing is really kno^vn of the curve. If the points are in a straight

line, it may undulate in any manner betvreen them. Nevertheless, it will

often be interesting and useful to consider the simplest case, in which

the undulations arc minimised. Many physical problems are known to
contain no undulatory element, and therefore their graphical solution may

reasonably be assumed to be the simplest curve, cleared of undulations,

which will pass through the points. When these are in a straight line,

the solution is obvious. It is not so if they are otherwise distributed. If,
for instance, three points in a plane be taken generally, the simplest curve
through them, having regard only to its intrinsic qualities, is a circle

but there are many conceivable conditions under which a catenary, or a
parabola, might be more probable. The uncertainty appears to be of the

same order as the selection of an independent variable. In the practice
of experienced draughtsmen, as well as in theory, there is no rule except
the general avoidance of discontinuity, and there are not wanting cases in

which a local discontinuity is the simplest interpretation. When a base

line is assumed, and ordinates are measured with reference to that, it is a
question whether the assumption that the second differential is constant is
not as good as the assumption that the curvature is so. The question is
not very material, except in extreme cases, where the whole process
becomes one of bare probability rather than of approximation. In the
ordinary application of the calculus of finite diiierences, the work is good

for nothing when any extreme is approached.
     The theory of interpolation by means of finite differences appears to

be, historically, a mere extension of the rule of 'proportional parts,'
namely, that part- way between the arguments corresponds to part-way

--between the entries the part-icay being in each case proportional. This

is not exact where one increases or diminishes uniformly, and the other
does not ; but it was vei'y early noticed that it was approximately true for
most tables, and the more nearly true in proportion as the interval between
the successive arguments was diminished, the approximation not being in
the direct ratio of the diminution of interval, but nearly as the square of

that diminution.

    Whether few or many orders of differences be taken, the value of the

process depends upon the sufficiency of the convergence. If that be
secured, the selection of the process is a mere matter of convenience.

Without it the process fails.
     One of the best examples of this is to be found in the quadrature of a

circular segment, by ordinates set off from its chord. The semicircle,
however many difierences be used, always gives a bad approximation,
even if a great number of ordinates be taken. Regarding the question

analytically, it appears that the differential coefficients of the ordinate are

all infinite at the limits of integration, and the convergence necessarily
fails. Geometrically, it is an attempt to represent a curve, which is
parallel to its ordinate, by a curve which never can be so within finite
range. If, however, instead of taking a semicircle, a smaller segment be
taken, there is no theoretical objection to the process ; convergency is
secured, and practically the requisite approximation is obtained.

     The difficulty above indicated has presented itself in the case of a

perfectly continuous curve, with everything ascertained, so that exact

ordinates can be obtained by calculation in any way and to any extent
that may be demanded. Very different considerations present themselves
in dealing with physical data, even when the given abscissjs and ordinates
are measui'ed with absolute precision. Here a further assumption of

simplicity is required, namely, that there is continuity (in the sense in
which that term is used in Cauchy's proof of Taylor's theorem) of the

same order as the number of differences used. This does not necessarily
exist. In a pressure diagram, for instance, the pressure may, as matter
of fact, have varied discontinuously between the selected ordinates, while

the assumption of process is, that it has varied continuously.
     It is worth while here to mention another problem in which arbitrary

processes are often used as if they were definite, and that is, the averaging
of discontinuous or irregular phenomena. To fix the ideas, consider the
population of a small island represented by the ordinate of a line, the
abscissa being proportional to the time. The population line will not be
a curve, but a series of steps, falling one unit at every death, and rising

--at every birth horizontal between. If the population be large, this will

--hardly be distinguishable from a curve probably a continuous one. But

if it is endeavoured actually to reduce it to an equivalent continuous curve,
this cannot be done with indefinite approximation, unless some further
assumption be introduced ; for any fair curve lying between one drawn
through the top edges of the steps and another through the bottom edges
will answer our indefinite question. The general answer is then uncertain
to the extent of this difference, at least. Each condition that it is subjected

--to as, for instance, equality of areas, of moments, of moments of inertia
--or the like merely introduces an equation which must be satisfied by the

coefficients of any algebraical formula which may be selected to represent

the data.

     Some degree of indeterminateness in amount must always remain,
unless the conditions are exhausted by assumptions suflicient to render

the curve determinate, or by evidence extraneous to the actual data of

observation.

     This is obvious enough when stated, being merely an extension, from
two to more quantities, as well as in genere, of the remark, that a mean is
indeterminate until we know what mean is meant. Yet it is no uncommon
thing to see observations discussed in disregard of this, and treated, not
as affording means of determining the parameters of a law assumed, or
derived aliunde, but as affording the means of determining the law itself

with completeness.

     The effect of discontinuity increases as we differentiate, and decreases
as we integrate. Thus a corner in a curve alters the tangent, or first
differential coefficient, discontinuously, and makes the second infinite,
while the ordinate only changes its rate of variation, and the change is
still less observable on the integral or area. The amount of discontinuity,
as well as its order, is to be considered. For many pur^DOses a small
discontinuity of low order is of about the same importance as a considerable

discontinuity of a higher order of diffei'entiation.

     The ordinary assumption, both in interpolation and in quadratures is,

that one quantity may be finitely expressed as a rational integral function

of the other, with a sufficient approximation, and that the constants of

this expression may be determined also with sufficient approximation,
from the known values of the quantity assumed to be so expressed as a

function of tlie other. That is to say, if one quantity be u, and the

other X, it is permissible to write

= + + +^l,^
rtg  a^x a^x^                                o,,a;"

= ++«o «o "i^'o                              ^"Cj &c.

There are other equivalent expressions which are sometimes more con-

venient, for instance :                      --(a,,    a;)

               = -- --u.^ (rtg cb) (fti a;)

Assuming a curve to be generated according to a continuous law,

if the equation between the ordinate and the abscissa is of a simpler

character, when integrally expressed, than

= + +2/ ao aiO!                              + «««"

that will be shown by the as with a high suffix vanishing, or, if finite
difierences be used, by the higher differences vanishing. It follows that,

if the ordinates are known to be exact, a form may in general be as-

--sumed, not less simple than the above that is to say, of a degree only one

--less than the number of ordinates and any simplification will appear

from the resulting equations. If, however, the law is in reality rnore

complex, the assumption made is only good as an approximation.
"Whether it be an approximation or not, hinges upon the question of

convergence.

     It will be shown further on that, as regards quadrature, the rules

--run in pairs, 2in 1 equidistant ordinates giving a result of the same

order of accuracy as 2m ordinates, and generally a rather better result

arithmetically. This is proved as far as 7 ordinates, and is a probable
inference generally. Assuming convergency, the higher rules would
seem to be better for the same number of ordinates than the lower. That
is to say, the rule of 9 ordinates or 8 intervals is better than the rule of 5

+intervals or 4 ordinates, taken as 4 4, and this again better than the rule
+ + +of 3 ordinates or 2 intervals taken as 2 2 2 2 ; while this again is

better than the polygonal rule taken as 8 x 1 .* The main part of the
foregoing reasoning is independent of any supposition as to the equi-

distance of the ordinates. But it does imply that the ordinates are
exactly given. If this be untrue, it is not easy to see how much proba-

bility is involved in our assumption. Apparently this question is indeter-

minate, like that of the best mean, where the object of the mean is not
stated. Mr. George Darwin has shown f that, for the quadrature of an
area of which the ordinates are liable to uncertainty, the broken line
simply joining the heads of the ordinates gives a more probable area

than that obtained by any of the higher parabolas.

     It may be worth while to remark, that, for the pui-poses of interpola-

tion, the relation of ordinate and abscissa is a supposition of mere

convenience, not of necessity. The only necessary relation is that of

function and variable.

    * It is more convenient to compare the number of intervals into which the base
is divided, than the number of ordinates. The arithmetical comparison always turn
upon the intervals.

     Witli quadrature, it is rather different. The ordinary formulae of
quadratures presuppose the relation of ordinate and abscissa, and any
variation of this supposition, such as a transformation to polar co-ordi-

nates, requires a corresponding change in the formula.
      In connecting integration, regarded as the inverse of differentiation,

with integi-ation viewed as the limit of summation, the fundamental
assumption is continuity, and that in a very restricted and special sense.
Its applications to interpolations · aud quadratures also presuppose con-
vergence, and unless both continuity and convergence are secured, any
arithmetical conclusions drawn from our processes must fail for want

of evidence of their application, when strictly considered. For rough

practical purposes, a great inany processes are useful in ordinary cases,
which will not bear carrying to extremes.

The only limitations are that q and r shall be positive and integral, and

+that r q shall not exceed n. With these limitations, the expansion is

identically verified. So far, no assumption is needed concerning equi-

distant variations.

It is worth while to notice the two points : that he obtained it as a limit,
and that he obtained it indirectly, the assumptions of- continuity and con-

observations on the theorem.

     % It is worth while, following Arbogast, to distinguish this theorem from that

underwritten, in which F affects the whole expression that follows it :

A little consideration will show that this is but another way of writing the identity

This is an important theorem, but a very different one, and it has no immediate

application to the object of this report.

Using the common formula of direct interpolation, the problem is to

find the value of n from the formula

where everything but n is known.
     Stopping at any given order (say the r*) of differences, neglecting all

beyond it, which is evidently permissible provided the difiei-ences be con-
vergent, and sufficiently so (and only on that hypothesis) this really
involves the solution of an equation of the r*'^ degree in n. It is usual
to efiect the solution by successive approximation, that is to say, by

stopping successively at the first, second, third, &c., difierences in succes-

sion, and determining at each step a new and more accurate value of n.

     Thus, neglecting all beyond the first difference, a first approximation

gives

This merely amounts to the use of proportionate parts.

The second step is to calculate

stantially the same as this, only differing in arrangement. The above arrangement
perhaps shows a little more obviously the reason why the constant part used is the
same in both formuliB. Stated more exactly, what is done is to introduce an inter-

mediate (but indefinite) limit, and to reverse one of the definite integrations.

For a third approximation

may be calculated : tliis gives

The process is very cumbrons when carried beyond the first correction of
the proportional part. But it has one very marked advantage, namely,

that, being a tentative process, any en'or in one step is more or less com-
pletely corrected at the next step, and the practical effect of accidental
erroi* is thns to make the approximation less rapid, instead of absolutely
vitiating the result. It might even happen that an error of calculation,
by being nearer {he required answer, might give a more rapid approxi-

mation.

The rapidity of approximation depends, firstly, upon the degree of

convergence ; and, secondly, upon the first approximation being suSiciently

near the required result. This is exactly parallel to what takes place in

the numerical solution of equations, and there is, here as there, the same

difficulty, presenting itself where any given approximation is nearly half-

way between two solutions, and the successive results oscillate between

the two, instead of convergingr to either.*

    When convergence is assured, this tentative method is probably the

best, and is at any rate the safest. An extension of Hutton's rule for

extracting roots t might possibly be found of use. But the criterion

of convergence in this process has not been satisfactorily determined.

There is, however, reason for believing that the convergence is not so

good as in the direct tentative process given above.

Tliis process is applicable, not only to the common formula of inter-

polation by descending differences, but to all formulae which can be

arranged by ascending powers or factorials of n, the index of interpolation

   There is usually an advantage, both in the symmetry of the formula

and in the probability of an accurate result, in taking ordinates on both

sides of the origin of interpolation. On any reasonable hypothesis, a mean

result is generally better than one near an extreme, and this remark is

verified by the greater tendency to convergence of the formulae when the

interpolated value lies near the origin of interpolation than when it lies

away from it. As a general rule, where extreme accuracy is required, it

should not lie farther off than half the equidistant interval! ' There are

then two kinds of symmetry to consider : symmetry to a central ordinate,

involving  an  odd number of              ordinates and an even number of intervals

rule for five ordinates or four intervals is

    To the above should be added Weddle's approximate rule for 7

This is a modification of the rule of seven ordinates already given,

     It will be observed that these formulas are symmetrical end for end,
and since the integration is between definite limits, the origin of the

abscissa; is indeterminate, and may be taken so as to fall in the middle, or

for the purposes of comparison, instead of taking

omitting the terms containing odd powers of x; and that we therefore

m --obtain no greater generality by using 2 ordinates instead of 2 m 1.

The error in either way is of the same order.
     The formula; of quadrature for an odd number of ordinates or an even

number of intervals appear to have been also given by James Stirling,;!:
who adds a set of what he calls corrections. The number of ordinates

--being 1in 1, the correction is of the foi-m

value exactly agree with the result obtained from integration, when both

ordinates. As a particular example, the correction for the rule of three

     The inaccuracy is not a mistake, because Stirling only uses them as a
test of approximation, and not as a means of obtaining accuracy.

     Bertrand (Cahul Integral) gives the corrections in a slightly difierent
form, from which the coefficients just given are obtainable by multiplying
Bertrand's corresponding coefficient by 2^'" : A^"' 0^'". In the following

Atwood makes a curious mistake in the rule of 8 ordinates. He is endeavouring

to correct Simpson, with whom, however, his result is really identical, only that

Atwood has introduced the factor 49 into both numerator and determinator, without

   Neglecting the last term, it appears that the ratio of error is as 4           in

   favour of Simpson's first rule as against the second.

   It is worth while to continue this comparison backwards. For thus

   it is not necessary to have recourse to arithmetic. Taking a parabola with

   axis parallel to the ordinates, it is easily seen that the rectangle between

   the middle ordinate and the base is a better approximation than the

   trapezium consisting of the chord, the base, and the extreme ordinates,

   + --and that the ratio of the errors is 1 : 2, the errors being of opposite

   sign.

   So far as the first six cases go, therefore, it appears that a rule with

an even number of ordinates has an error numerically about double tbat
of tlie corresponding rule for one ordinate less. The number of cases
tried is not sufficient to warrant any general inference as to the compara-
tive amount of error, especially when we consider their signs ; but it is
highly probable that the rule with an odd number of oi'dinates is always
better arithmetically than, and not only of the same order of error as,
the rule with one- more ordinate. As has already been stated, no

general investigation of these comparative values appears to have been
made. The point is, however, one rather of analytical curiosity than
of real importance. The rules requiring high orders of differences are
better replaced by lower rules with more ordinates, unless in the very rare
cases where the ordinates themselves are difficult to calculate. It is
claimed that such an exception is found in calculating the curve of stability

of a ship when the mainwale, or armour shelf, and the deck are successively
immersed ; but there is at least a doubt in these cases whether the dis-
continuity, which makes the calculation of more ordinates difficult, does

not vitiate the accuracy of the higher ordei's of differences. If that be

--so, the advantage sought by their use namely, to be sure of not adding

an error of calculation to the errors of measurement, or to the errors due.

--to wide intervals would of course be lost. Nevertheless the higher rules

are analytically nearer the truth, and must be actually so in certain cases.
Only it must not be taken for granted that these are usual cases. It is
the practice of French naval architects to use the polygonal rule through-

out their calculations, in deliberate preference to the rule of three ordinates.

The arithmetical work is thereby much simplified, and so the liability to

accidental error is diminished. Moreover by taking ordinates sufficiently
close, the error of the rule can be reduced without limit, and where the
ordinates are inexact, it is not clear that the parabolic rule has any
advantage.*

     In dealing with actual data, the use of a large number of ordinates has
evidently the advantage of taking a more comjjlete account of the facts

than the use of a smaller number. Any want of continuity between the

ordinates is necessarily ignored by all the rules, and that to the greater

extent, the greater the interval.

     The rule of nine ordinates, and many of the higher rules, involve nega-

tive as well as positive coefficients, and are inconvenient on that account.
     The amount of the difference between the use of the polygonal rule

and the parabolic (or Simpson's first) rule is best shown geometrically

as follows

    * Dr. Fan has used the same rule, or an arithmetical process equivalent to it,

for the integrations used in the Life Tables calculated under his superintendence by

the Eeoistrar-General's Department. See the Sixth, Eleventh, and Tivclfth lieports

     Let Aa, Hh, Cc be throe consecutive equidistant ordiuates. Then, by
the polygonal rule, the area is represented by the trapeziums AahJi
and HbcC. Let at, ic be tangents at the extremities of the curve, and
draw a t' parallel to tc. Then the actual area of the curve regarded

as a common parabola is the trapezium AacC plii,s |^ of the triangle

                                                                                               o

    When more oi'dinates are used, it is easy, by repeating the construciion,

to form a triangle which shall give a superior limit to the error made by

substituting the trapezoidal rule for the parabolic. For the geometrical

addition of the curvilinear segments, taking each as two-thirds of its

circumscribing triangle corresponds very nearly (although not exactly)

'to an algebraical addition which can be effected graphically on the second
ordinate from each end, by drawing parallels to the chords and tangents
from the head of the first ordinates.* It also follows that if the tangents
at the extremities of the curve are para;llel, the difference between the two

--rules disappears, and they lead to a result practically identical that is to

say, only differing by an error of a high order.

     Section 4. MuUi/de integrals, ordinates not differenced.

A multiple integral of the form / /                   xh dx dy, in which

the limits ai'e all constant, and the variables (except m) all independent,
can be computed by treating each variable separately, by a repeated appli-
cation of any process of arithmetical integration. In the case of a double
integral applied to the calculation of volume this is equivalent to cutting
the volume by parallel plane sections, obtaining the areas of these by any
method of ordinates, and then summing the areas of these sections, each
taken as an ordinate, to obtain the volume. Thus, taking nine equidistant
ordinates with the interval h in one direction, and Tc in another at right
angles to it, and calling them

                                                                      tti &1 Ci

So that the volume of the paraboloid for nine ordinates is given by either
set of five symmetrical ordinates only : that is to say, by either the central
one and those at the four corners, or by the central one and the four at
the middle points of the sides of the square.

    Dr. "Woolley, to whom this simplification is due, showed that this rule

applied not only to one paraboloid through the heads of the nine ordi-

nates, but to the sum of the volumes of two paraboloids in two ways,

either

   or

In fact, let h.^ be taken for origin, a^ h^ 0-2 for the axis of x, and h^ h.^ 63 for

the axis of 1/, 2 being normal to the plane of the paper, then writing the

equation to a paraboloid as

   hx  cij       dx^             ey^ fxtj         ax^  fix'^y  y xi/

+--and integrating first with regard to y between the limits          x, and

then with regard to x between the limits and h, the volume whose base
is the triangle Cj &2 ^'s is expressed by

     The rule for the corner ordinates is not very convenient. The other
rule, when we have nine ordinates only, may be written, having regard to

the coefficients alone, as

                            010

                            121

                            010

For a considerable number, say 5 X 11, it becomes
                                              01010101010
                                              12222222221

                                              01010101010

   The rule for the coefficients is that all the ordinates which are odd in both
planes of section have the coefficient zero : all the others have the co-
efficient 2, except the border rows and columns, where the coefficient is
1 instead of 2. The summation, governed by these coefficients, has then

to be multiplied by -2 hh,                                  Let

   A geometrical proof is easily given, as follows.

abed be a portion of the paraboloid corresponding to the

rectangular base ABCD, and let the planes of section

be supposed (in the first instance) parallel to principal

planes. It is a well-known property of the paraboloid

that its sections by any series of planes parallel to one                      c

another and to the axis, are similar and equal parabolas.                j>

Two applications of the polygonal rule are easily seen to be equivalent

to drawing a hypei-bolic paraboloid through the heads of every four ordi-

nates, the four right lines joining the ordinates two and two being the

generators (of both systems). The last paragraph shows that its volume-

integral can be expressed by interpolating a middle ordinate, and using

that only, instead of the four others. This appears to be equivalent to

the reduction obtained by Woolley's rule in the degree above ; but it is

-- --of no practical use, seeing that it only substitutes the sum of (r?i 1) (?i 1)

ordinates for that of mn ordinates, an advantage which, in general, is no

compensation for the interpolation.

it is to be observed that, -wLile the first is less accurate on tbe supposition
that the surface is of strictly parabolic character, and convergent, yet it has

the advantage of taking account of the surface (using the above example)
at 45 points instead of 30. It thvis secures that the surface to which

the arithmetical summation refers shall coincide with the surface to be

measured in 45 points as against 30, on the assumption of accurate
measurements. The advantage of the higher rule, therefore, depends upon

there being no possibility of a pei'iodic term, and upon thei'e being no such

"want of convergence as would render terms of higher degree than x^ y^

noticeable. If the ordinates are inexact, this advantage of the polygonal

rule holds a fortiori.

   The author has shown* that there exists a similar reduction in the

number of ordinates necessary for the summation of a triple integral.

in which the absolute middle ordinate does not appear. In fact, arrang-
ing the 27 letters which represent the ordinates in a ctibe, the only ones
which appear are the middle ordinates of faces. The late Professor

Rankine expressed this rule in the following form : ' The mean density
of a parallelepiped is the mean of the densities at the middle points of

its six faces.' This supposes the density to be a parabolic function of the

three co-ordinates, not higher than the third degree, and thus, of course,
excludes the case (which usually presents itself physically) of the density
varying from the middle to the bounding surface. This rule, like

Woolley's, may be modified by using- corner ordinates, or the ordinates

corresponding to the middle points of the edges : only then the formulae
are less simple, and the middle ordinate of all does not disappear.

     All the remarks about Woolley's rule inadequately representing the
surface, as compared with the polygonal rule, apply a fortiori to this.

Whatever may be the convergence, except upon a certain limited hypo-

thesis, namely, that the function is of definite parabolic form, coincidence
between the actual subject of integration, and the subject of summation,
is secured at too few points for the results to be i-eliable.

     It had been observed by the author that there was a peculiar relation

of the ordinates in these rules, namely,

one integration (the last) is between definite limits, the others being

as tliey disappear when the origin of integration is suitably taken, they

that each term of the expansion contains zero as a factor. Nevertheless,

--tbe summation is not identical with the complete elliptic integral, as may

easily be ascertained upon trial and there are many other functions
which present the same peculiarity. The paradox seems the greater, in-

asmuch as the numerical coefficients of the differential forms are highly

convergent, seeing that when r is large

             %VT2'-^ =l:4.^ = l:40nearly.

The explanation, however, is, that the numerical coefficients introduced
by the differentiation performed upon u increase without limit, so that

minate, and may (and usually will) exceed the corresponding factor in

the previous term in some ratio which is a multiple of r*, and which
increases without limit as r increases. Then the series finally becomes
divergent, and the paradox is solved.

    In many such cases, and notably so in the rectification of the

quarter-ellipse, the subdivision of the base, that is to say, an increase in

the number of ordinates, gives exti-emely rapid convergence towards the

     It frequently happens that it is required to find, by means of given
ordinates, whether differenced or not, the value of some particular
difi"erential co-ejB&cient, or else the value of the variable corresponding
to some given value of the differential coefficient. These ultimately
depend upon the symbolic equation

suitably transformed and duly interpreted, or solved. In certain cases,

the desired result may be obtained by mere algebraical transformation,
by indeterminate coefficients or otherwise.

    As an example, let it be required to obtain a formula for the tangent

at the head of the middle ordinate of the set

The process is perfectly general, and needs no further remark, except
that the work might have been made a little more symmetrical by taking

the middle ordinates as origin. This will give considerable simplification

    The general problem of maxima and minima is, in interpolation as in

=ordinary analysis, to determine u and x so as to make -^ 0. It is a

=particular case of the more general problem in which y- a, but it is

practically much simpli6ed by the consideration that Am is generally very

--small when vanishes, so that the approximate position of the maximum

or minimum is visible at sight ; but there is no such help in the general

case.

    The process for determining a maximum or minimum is to expand

+(1 £^y Uq as a rational integral function of x, and also such that the

ftinctions of A appearing in it shall be capable of interpretation ; then to

differentiate with regard to x, and equate the result to zero. The appro-

priate root of the resulting equation thus gives the value of x, and that

of ttj. is then found by interpolation. As already stated, there is practi-

cally an approximate value, obtained at sight, to start the more exact

approximation. The most obvious course is to take the ordinary bi-

nomial expansion, namely,

to be. Graphical processes, however, or trial and error, soon remove an^y

difficulty.

     It must be remembered that the determination of a tangent is of a
higher order of precision than the determination of the point of contact.

It follows that the determination of the argument corresponding to the

maximum or minimum value of a tabulated function Is less precise than

that of the corresponding value of the function, and also less precise
than Its determination generally.

This process is essentially unsymmetrical, as is evidenced by its diagonal
character. But any horizontal line has symmetry as regards the general
scheme, and accordingly the line n.y, A^h,, A^Mq is said to be a set of
symmetrical differences, that is to say, symmetrical to a value or ordinate.
So again the set A^^2, ^^Uy, A^w^, is said to be symmetrical to an interval.

   --It Avill be observed that this process is an alternate one that it is

not possible to pass from one column to the next, but always to the next
but one. The operative symbol at each actual step, as, for instance, from

+A^(ti to A^mq) is always A^ : (1 A) and the direct problems of interpo-
+lation and quadrature by symmetrical differences are to express (1 A)-^

+ =aiid tuclx in a series of ascending powers of A'' 1: A Z^. It so

happens that (1 + A)-^ can be expanded by ascending powers of Zj but
not by powers of Z-. This introduces terms of the form A : s/ (1 + A)

which cannot be interpreted so long as terms used are confined to one
horizontal line, thus implying that the expansion must be a double series.
The series itself was given by Newton,* but without proof. The connec-
tion between the two parts of the series is a difEerential one. This is
perhaps best shown as follows, using the notation

        = ==Z A2 : ( 1 -f A) -(B E1)2 : E + E-i - 2,

M= = =1 A(E - E->)                     +^            M2^±_^).

If the second difference is small, the correction for the alternate difference

Ais very easy.                                                particular case of this formula was suggested by Sir

John Leslie * for continuing either Briggs' or Vlacq's logarithm tables.

For the difference between the logarithms of (say 11000 and 11002 is the

same as between those of 6500 and 5501, and the formula given above

enables us to find from it the difference between the logarithms of 10099

and 11001, and so on, so that the odd series can thus be quickly calculated,

and the extension of the table to double its former range effected with

very little more than mere copying. ' Mere copying,' however, when
applied to an extensive table of logarithms, is so laborious, and such
a fruitful source of eiTor, that this application of the method has never

been made. Nevertheless, it is a very convenient process for interpolating

tables of physical or other observations, where the second difference is not

very considerable.

The problem of definite or tabular interpolation is this : given a table,

or a set of differences, corresponding to a given equal interval ; to con-

struct from it a table corresponding to some other equal interval, usually

a sub-multiple of the former. For example, suppose a function to be

tahulated (or given by differences) for every ten minutes, and that it is

required to find the means of tabulating it to every minute ; it would be

possible  to                                              interpolate  separately to             every            intermediate  value                             but  this
                                                                                                                                                               ;

would be unreasonably laborious, and what is usually needed is to find a

set of differences corresponding to the reduced interval, from which the

table may be set up, either by arithmetical summation, or by a difference

engine.

    Let A be the symbol of differencing for the wider interval, and o for

the smaller interval, and let

                       E = l + A,e = l + cZ
=then the fundamental relation between the two scales is E e", and the

analytical problem is simply to express a selected function of e in terms
either of E, or of a selected system of functions of it. The equation

=E eTM arises simply from a comparison of the original and interpolated

series, namely,

of any such function of e in terms of the selected function of E. The

assumption, that Uq and Uq should coincide, is not a necessary one.

The only effect of their not coinciding is to substitute the equation

= =E" e""'+'' for the simpler form E" e'"".

    An exposition of the application of this method to symmetrical

differences appears to have been first given by Henry Briggs in his Arith-

metica Logarithmica, published in 1824. But it appears from his preface

that the tables of sines, afterwards published by Gellibrand in the Tri-

gonometria Britannica, had been calculated by Briggs, by a more or less

complete application of these rules, twenty years earlier.* His exposition

is, however, not very well suited to modern use, being rather too much

Aspecialised, with a view of suiting his own work.          more general

exposition of the method is given by Roger Cotes in his Canonotechnia,

sive constructio tabularum per clifferentias.] This, besides general rules,

contains the tabulated coefHcients for the bisection, trisection, and quin-

qnisection of the interval. It does not appear that the subject was

resumed until recently, when Mr. Woolhouse gave both tables and

formulee for the division of the interval by 5 and by lO.J

     According to Lacroix, the method of tabular interpolation for-ordinary

differences was first published by Mouton, to whom it was given by his

friend Regnaud, in 1670, and afterwards reduced to a general formula by

Lagrange and Prony. The method is as follows. Let Uq Ui ti.^
be a series of numbers, of which the fourth difference may be neglected,

and suppose that it is desired to obtain the differences for interpolating

two numbers between each. Let the required differences be h, c, d, the

original differences being i-epresented in the usual way by Ajt^, A2Mo> &c. .

+ + +Then, if the interpolated series Uq, iiq ^j "o 2 Z< c, &c. be formed, and

the terms representing Uq Ui &c. be picked out, they give

The tables given by Cotes and Woolhouse for symmetrical diiFerences

appear to have been formed upon the same principle.

   A question of some interest in the interpolation of tables, in which the

number tabulated is only approx{nlately*c6rVe'ct, is whether it is preferable

to apply proportional parts to the true calculated difference of the

function, or to the actual tabular difference. Thus in the seven-figure

logarithms           =log 66310 4-8215790

                     =log 66311 4-8215856

the tabular difference is 66, while the correct difference as obtained fi-om

Vega's ten-figure table is 65494, which, to seven figures, is only 65. The
question is, whether it is better to use 65 or 66 for finding the proportional
parts. By a comparison of the extreme cases, M. Lefort* has shown that

so long as the tabular difference (that is to say, the difference actually

found between the numbers as given in the table) is used, the last figure
in the interpolated result cannot be in error by more than unity while

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

if the true calculated difference, cut down to the nearest figure, be used,
the last figure may be in error by more than unity. It follows that the
actual difference of the table, and not the mean difference given in some
tables (such as Hutton and Callet), should be used for the interpolation.

      Section 9. Interpolation of Douhle Entry Tables, or Functions of two or more

                                                                        Variables,

     The problem of the interpolation of functions of two variables presents
but few diflBculties beyond those of interpolation of functions of a single
variable, excepting what i^ dije.tp J;he increased complexity of the process.
This renders many of the special artifices practically iinmanageable,

although the very fact of the complexity increases the importance of
simplifying the actual work. Nevertheless, it is better on the whole, in
processes which are not of frequent use, to encounter deliberately a little
excess of arithmetical labour, rather than to risk the chances of error from
want of analytical simplicity and perspicuity. If any one process should

be often wanted, those who need it may be left to invent the special

machinery.

     The general theorem of interpolation for double entry is expressed in
the two formal identities.

                     «,, = (l + A)-(H-S)"«oo

in which A refers to variation with regard to x, on the supposition that y

is constant, and Z refers to variation with regard to y, on the supposition

that X is constant.

In general it is usual to give equal weight to the two variations, that

is to say, that if it is proposed to neglect terms of the order p, then all

terms of the form A'" o", where in -f- n =2^, are to be discarded, whatever

mmay be the separate values (always supposed positive) of and n. The

terms of the expansion would thus be grouped as

                     =Wx,v  «o

                     +

Bnt this supposition is entirely arbitrary, and not even justifiable if it
happens to be known tbat the second and higher differences are con-

siderably greater in one direction than in the other. This, and the remedy
for it, are only to be ascertained by a special study of the function.

    In accordance with common practice, the direct expansion by ordinary

differences has been used; but there is no motive for this except con-

venience and simplicity. Subject to the difficulties of interpretation and

handling which they introduce, any form of the expansion

            = =+ +«,, (1 A)- (1 A)" uo                              E'^ E" uo

·will answer the purpose. There are even cases in which it would be
desirable to form an interpolated table for the given value of one variable
on the supposition that the other is constant, and then to interpolate

that as a single entry table.
     Thus, supposing that going along a line in the table represents the

variation of y, and going down a column represents the variation of x,
then the whole column corresponding to a particular value of y might be

interpolated, value by value, so as to give the series arranged in
column

and then interpolation to w^,,, might be effected by single entry ; or the
process might be reversed, and the line

                     WjO '*.ll '^3:2 ^^.3

formed first, and then v,,, by single entry interpolation.

It is worth while to remark that the interpolation may occasionally

be reduced to single entry interpolation along a diagonal line. This is

always the  case in  bisection but                                  it is by no means confined to  that
                                                                 ;

case.

The inverse problem of interpolation is in general of a higher order of

indeterminateness, unless some other data are given than the mere value

of the ordinate. For if the two variables be regarded as horizontal, and

the function as representing a vertical ordinate, then the ordinate being

given in value, merely furnishes a locus, namely, a level line. So if one

of the variables be given, a special table may be formed for that value of

the variable, and then the inverse interpolation is an operation of single

entry. . But if, instead of this, some equation be given between x and y,
the problem falls out of the province of direct synthesis, unless the

relation between x and y be that they are in a constant ratio. The

analogy is of course that of the representation of a surface in geometry of

three dimensions, and that analogy is really the key to the question.

    An example of the interpolation of a double entry table as far as

third differences is given by Legendre.*

Quadrature in two dimensions is really equivalent to the evaluation of

solid volume. The two quadratures may be effected either separately,

or by the methods indicated in Section IV, 4, of this report.

Another problem arising out of a double entry table is that of inter-

            * Traitc deg Fonctions Elliptiqves, vol. ii. p. 201 (cap. xv.)

polation to the direction of a normal line or tangent plane. This, in the
ordinary language of partial differential coefficients, is the evaluation of

                 ^{l+f + q'].

The first thing is to find p and q by the methods for interpolation of

ordinates (IV, 6) and then to form the radical. Graphical methods are,
however, generally the most convenient for this. The integration of this
radical in two dimensions gives the surface. For an example of this
particular form of interpolation combined with quadrature, see Scott
Russell's ' Modern Naval Architecture,' and the 'Transactions of the
Institution of Naval Architects,' vol. vi. for 18G5, p. 64.

      Tables of treble (or higher multiples) entry are of course confined
within very narrow limits. Their interpolation calls for no special re-
mark, unless it be that the indeterminateness, as well as the complexity,
increases with every additional dimension. This remark is true, as a
separate consideration, firstly with regard to the general indeterminate-
ness of all interpolation, and secondly with regard to the indeterminateness

of the inverse processes, with reference to the possibility of more roots
than one, and to the requirement of more data than the ordinate.*

V. Inteepolation and Quadeature with Ordinates not equidistant.

                   Section 1. Newton's method.

     The principal theorem of interpolation when the distances between flie

ordinates are arbitrary instead of equidistant, is given by Newton, in his
' Principia,'t under this title, ' Invenire lineam curvam generis parabohcl

quae per data quotcumque puncta transibit.' It consists of a method of
divided differences, and Newton uses it in a form which is, as exactly as

may be, the counterpart of that which he uses when the ordinates are

equidistant. It is not thought necessary to reproduce it here, as the

reference to it is very easy. J

    Professor Emory McClintock, of Milwaukee, has given § a modifica-

tion of Newton's formula, which lends itself better to logarithmic com-
putation. The terras being <l>Xi or ^o^^i) ^^-x or ^o^2> ^Jid so forth, the

Lagrange's tbeorem of interpolation, althoagh identical in its results

with Newton's, is in a form analogous rather to the case of ordinates not

differenced, than to the use of differences, which is the analogy followed

by Newton. As is well known, it depends upon

in succession, so as to obtain a series of quantities Xg Xj Xj . . . X^, the

formula of interpolation is

=U^ ^qUq + X, zt, + X2 «2                                   + X,,«,,

=The proof consists in the observation that since X^ 1, and all the other
=Xs vanish when a' =: a,, it leaves u^ ?tj. as it ought to do. Although this

formula usually bears Lagrange's name, it is said to be really due to

Buler. The chief advantage of it over Newton's method is, that the co-

eflScients are in a form adapted to logarithmic computation.

' The differential coefficients of u^ with regard to x may be obtained by

actually differentiating the resulting formula, either in Newton's or in

Lagrange's method. But they may also be obtained, as in the common

theory of equations, by an obvious application of Maclaurin's theorem.*

The quadrature can also be effected, as was pointed out by Newton,

by the application of the ordinary methods for the measurement of an

area of parabolic form. It does not appear that the details have as yet

received much attention, but it is evident that the final formula of either

Newton or Lagrange may be integrated between limits, by direct integ-

ration, and that the result of the integration may be expressed in terms of

the intervals and ordinates, either by direct substitution, or by the help of

indeterminate coefficients. Judging from the form in which Laplace has

placed the differential coefficients, it is probable that some interesting

results would be obtained by such an investigation ; but these results
would be likely to be more interesting as a matter of form, than useful as

a matter of arithmetic.

                 --Section 3. Gauss's Method of Quadratwre.

     This method is of high analytical interest, as connecting the theory of
interpolation with what are known indifferently as Spherical Harmonics,
or as Lagrange's or Laplace's functions. It is also useful and in-
teresting from the point of view of their inventor, in making the best
possible use of a small number of ordinates, when the function subjected
to this mode'" oT quadrature is capable of exact expression in a parabolic

form. If this last condition be not assured, its arithmetical value also
becomes in a like degree uncertain. It has assuredly never been proved that

there is any general advantage in adapting the rules, indicated by the
parabolic theory as the most exact, to cases which are not known to fall

strictly within that theory.

. Gauss's proposal is to select the absciss© in sucli a manner that the
error of a quadratui-e, obtained by means of n selected ordinates, shall
disappear in the application of this quadrature to any rational function
not exceeding the degree of 2 n--l. Tor this purpose, supposing the limits of

--366 REPOBT 1880.

o£ tlie other theorems of interpolation, the reader is referred to Mr.
Monlton's notes to ch. iii. of Boole's 'Finite Differences,' second edition, and*
to the examples of the same chapter. The extensions of Gauss's method
are of too special application to need exposition here, especially con-

sidering their very doubtful utility in dealing with actual, as distinguished
from analytical, data.

It is important to observe that both Newton's and Cotes's methods

admit of a far wider generalisation of form. The parabolic character of

the assumption usually made, that the function subjected to interpolation

or quadrature is either a rational integral function of the variable, or a

convergent series, is not by any means necessary. On the contrary, the

very form of Lagrange's expression shows that it is permissible to sub-

stitute for the simple factors, functions of those factors arbitrarily chosen,

with only such restriction as to form as is needed to prevent the formula

becoming confused or nugatory.* This is merely another way of stating

the essentially indeterminate character of interpolation. It has to be

shown, as a prior condition of the use of any such specialised formula,

that there is good reason for applying it, and that its results are reliable.
The reason for generally selecting the ordinary methods turns upon the

two principles, that a. function can be approximately represented by a

convergent rational series, and that the approximation can be made as
great aswe please by taking the intervals sufficiently small. It has already

been pointed out that these principles are not universally true, and, as

particular cases, that they are not so when there is either physical dis-

continuity, or discontinuity within the meaning given to it in the proofs

of Taylor's theorem. An examination into the questions corresponding to

these is needed in using any such functional substitute for the simple

factors of the parabolic assumption, in order to render the method safe

and complete. There are doubtless many cases in which this may be

practically neglected. In those cases there may be a doubt as to the

necessity for any such refinement at all, except as a mere matter of

selecting the proper function for interpolation,! and indeed the complete

investigation frequently amounts, in the end, to nothing more than doing

this. It even sometimes brings back the question to the determination

of an analytical expression which shall adequately represent the table or
Aseries of observations.
                          very remarkable instance of this is the repre-

sentation, due to the late Benjamin Gompertz,+ of the decrements of

life by means of a double exponential function.                   The equivalent

physical assumption is that the stock of vital force undergoes a weakening

proportional to the time, and this assumption, not improbable in itself,

is found, with a suitable determination of the parameters in each case, to

represent, with a high degree of accuracy, all the best life-tables, through

special interpretation, or if special forms are incautiously generalised. ^-' <\>x is a
well-known example of this trap for the unwary.

a very considerable portion of their range. Nevertheless its insufficiency

is shown by its being impossible to apply the rule to the whole range of
the observed life-table (including infant and senile life), without either
losing accuracy, or introducing a discontinuous change into the para-

meters. Investigations of this description, however, belong rather to
analysis than to mere interpolation. Their importance can hardly be

overrated, especially when functions involving more than one parameter

have to be considered ; for tables of double entry are very cumbrous,
and to go beyond that is practically impossible. Hence the importance
of Gompertz's formula, and the corresponding importance of those of
Jacobi's investigations * which have rendered it possible to reduce the
evaluation of elliptic functions, primarily depending upon three variable
quantities, to a combination of results obtained from interpolating double-

entry tables. It seemed advisable to point out the bearing of these

considerations upon the subject of interpolation, although their detailed

exposition lies outside the scope of this report.

VI. Interpolation and Quadeature for Uncertain Values.

When a number of observations of a phenomenon, which can yield but

a single numerical value, have to be compared, the ordinary theory of the
errors of observation furnishes the most probable numerical amount of

that value, or of any given function of that value ; and this whether the

observations be all equally good, or have definite numerical weights

Aattached to each.  further refinement has been introduced by attaching

weights themselves derived from the departure of the individual observa-

tions from the first mean. This is a perfectly definite process, and the

only remark which needs to be made upon it here is, that the most

probable value of a given function of the result is not the same thing as

the given function of the most probable value of the result.

    When an unknown curve is only known by a number of points, each

determined subject to some unknown but appreciable error, the problem of

finding the curve is absolutely indeterminate, unless some assumption be

made as to the nature of the curve. This will be best seen by taking an

easy problem, in which the indeterminateness is removed by a simple

supposition. Let us assume that a right line has been observed, and is

to be plotted by means of a set of equidistant ordinates, but that upon

setting them off, the heads are not in a right line. It is then a perfectly

definite problem to find a right line such that the squares of the distances

of the points from it shall be a minimum, and in accordance with the

fundamental principle of the ordinary theory, we shall find the same right

line in whatever uniform direction we measure the distances. But the

assumption that the line through the observed points is a right line, is

exactly what we want to avoid in the general problem. On the other

hand, when points of a curve are definitely given, we may make the curve

determinate by assuming that its continuity is of the highest order

possible. In its simplest form this is effected by assuming the curve to

have a parabolic equation                                                                                                                   but this is not essential,  and we  may settle  it
                                                                                                                                         ;

of facility we take for the nature of the curve connecting the points, that

is evidently- independent of the law by which the points are assumed,

and there is no law connecting the two systems of probability. Any

attempt to attain determinateness is therefore of necessity futile.
      This indeterminateness is experienced in practice as well as indicated

by theory. One of the commonest modes of ' fairing ' a curve thi-ough
given points is by using a flexible batten, or spline, which is pinned down
by lead weights to the points through which the curve is to be drawn, and
the pen is then drawn along the batten. Now, in practice, it is found
impossible to use similar battens for all curves. The batten has to be
weakest where the curvature is the greatest, and it is a matter of taste
and discrimination to select a batten with the proper taper, and to use it
discreetly, so as to get a reasonable and presentable result. The use of
moulds or curved patterns is still more a matter of eye.

     In the case of a curved surface such as that of a ship, the problem is
rendered somewhat more determinate by the consideration that all the
sections, and all their projections, must be fair curves. The two sets of
vertical sections, and the water sections, thus correct one another, and it

is not an uncommon thing to complete the ' fairing ' by means of diagonal
lines. Another mode, nearly equivalent, is to make a model, and to
work it until it is not only quite smooth, but until, when it is held up in
every possible light, the shadows fall evenly and fairly upon it. This

is quite as severe a test as the drawing. Nevertheless, in either case the
adjustment is not a matter of rule, but of taste and judgment. Apart

from the mechanical skill necessary to produce such, work, there are many

people whose perceptions are not sufficiently delicate to appreciate or

test it.

     While the problem is thus really and intrinsically indeterminate, all
the solutions being strictly secundum quid, instead of being general, the
difficulty is by no means beyond the reach of practical skill in the most

Auseful cases. comparatively small number of sections in two dimensions

will enable two experienced draughtsmen to produce a couple of ships
which shall differ very little in size or shape when they come to he

built.

    It may be worth while to repeat that the indeterminateness really

turns upon the want of any arithmetical comparison between two inde-
pendent systems of variation of error, or of any analytical means of com-
bining them so as to give a single determinate result.*

    * On this subject see Mr. G. H. Darwin on 'Graphical Interpolation and

Integration,' Messenger of Mathematics, January 1877, p. 134, and the same author
on ' Fallible Measures of Variable Quantities,' Philos. Mag. for July 1877. In the
former paj^er Mr. Darwin gives a simple proof that the use of tlie trapezoidal rule
gives a less probable error for the area of a curve, when the ordinates are taken as
having each the same possible numerical error, than is given by the higher parabolic
rules. The arbitrariness of tliis assumption as to the law of error should not pass

unnoticed.

     See also a paper by Mr. Eckart in the Transactions of tJie Institution of Naval
Architects, vol. xiii. (1872) p. 318 and plate xv., for an example of a fair curve drawn
through a series of points whose positions require correction. See, further, a paper
by Dr. McAlister in the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics for this year (1880), on
the use of the Geometrical Mean for giving the most probable result. This is
equivalent to using the logarithms of the terms, instead of the actual terms, in the

equation of probability.

The ordinaiy assumption of interpolation is that there shall be no

periodicity in the function, and this assumption is involved in the

apjDroximate equation virtually assigned to the carve being of parabolic

form. Any pei'iodicity vitiates the accuracy of the result, and the

detection of this periodicity is necessary before any correction can be

applied, or any special methods adapted to the jjeriodic character.

In observed results, rather long series are required before periodicity

can be detected, unless it can be independently inferred from analytical

or phj^sical considerations. It is best detected by plotting a curve of

the function, and the process may be facilitated by first transforming

the function so as to deprive it of any very abrupt curvature. The

oscillation will then generally become visible, or may be made so by an

elliptic exaggeration of ordinates, taken nearly normal to the general

direction of the curve.

The arithmetical methods of detecting periodicity are mere trans-

formations of this geometrical principle. They are very difficult and

intricate pieces of work, especially when the periodicity is of high order
and small amplitude. Examples may be seen in the discussions of the

inequalities of the planetary systems in astronomical works, and, in a less

elaborate way, in the discussion of the various periodicities which have

been associated with the sun-spot period.* They also joresent themselves

in the discussion of tides                                                                                                              but in these cases the probability of a period is
                                                                                                                                     ;

sufficiently evident to cause it to be looked for in the proper way.

"When the period is once found, there is seldom much difficulty in

dealing with it, either for interpolation or for quadrature.

VIII. Systematic Computation op Quadratures and Interpolations.

In all work connected with either interpolation or quadrature it is

necessary, both, for convenience and correctness, to do the work in a

neat and well-arranged tabular form. The expression given in many

books for the parabolic quadrature, namely, ' to the sum of the first and

last ordinates add four times the sum of all the even ordinates, and twice

the sum of all the other ordinates, and multiply the total by one-third of

the intei'val ' is not the form in which any practised computer would

think of working. The slight repetition of labour involved in the tabular

form is as nothing compared with the trouble and chance of error involved

in disturbing the regular order of the ordinates. Moreover, when moments

ai'e required, as well as mere area, the tabular arrangement is a clear

gain of work. An example of the arrangement for obtaining the centre

of gravity of a curvilinear area is given below. The curve selected for

y=2 --integration is                                                                                                                               2, for the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of a;.
       \/ (x -|- 1)

the centre of gravity are

double integration is easily effected between the required limits, either by

WooUey's rule, or by any other method which may suit the case.*
     It is of some consequence to conduct the work so that the degree of

accuracy may be as nearly as possible the same throughout. It is best to
follow the rule of using as nearly as possible the same number of signifi-

cant figures right through. Thus it is idle to use five or six figures for a

moment, and only two or three for the coordinate of the centre of gravity,

because either there are more than we want for the moment, or else there
are not enough if we require any further step to be taken from the value
so found for the centre of gravity. It is a common thing to see much
good work disfigured by want of attention to this. The rule above sug-
gested is not absolute ; but it is on^he whole the best to work from, except

in some special cases, which a little thought will easily discriminate.
     It is scai'cely necessary to enter into any detailed disquisition con-

cerning the application of arithmetic to interpolations. Probably too

Of mere interpolation, there is no need to say anything here. When

once a function is represented by the ordinate of a curve, the interpolatiou

is effected at sight, whether the direct interpolation from the intermediate

value of the variable, or the inverse operation of obtaining the value of

the variable corresponding to a given value of the ordinate. "In the same

way a parallel ruler will give us the means of interpolating direction, and-

of finding maxima and minima.

In the case of quadra,ture there is something to be said, although that

is very little more than the translation of the arithmetic into geometry.

--The geometry is practically restricted to the simple parabolic rule, or to

the trapezoidal rule the parabolas of higher order are of course tmsuited

to graphical work. That they are so has already been showm to be a

matter of no great consequence.

The fundamental opeiation of quadrature is that of finding the aret

of a plane curve. It is convenient to reduce the construction to that of

finding the area included between a base line, two parallel ordinates at

i-ight angles to the base, and a curved line forming a fourth side to the

figure. As has been already remarked, this curve must never be parallel

to an ordinate, nor should it have any abi'upt curvatures.

If we work by the trapezoidal rule, we may divide the base into any

number of intervals                                                                                                              if by  the parabolic (or  Simpson's)  rule  we  must
                                                                                                                              ;
--take an even number of intervals ; and in either case we draw ordinates

--through the points of division. Taking the simpler rule first Avhich is

equivalent to assuming that the line joining the heads of two successive

--ordinates is straight the sum of the first and second ordinates is set off'

on the second ordinate. This represents twice the area of the curve

between those ordinates, w^hich doubled area is a strip equal to the length

so set off, and of the width of the interval between the ordinates. Twice

the area between the second and third ordinates is similarly represented-

    * An example of one arrangement for this purpose was given by the aiUhor in'

vol. vi. of the Trans. I.K.A. pp. 04-72, and also in Scott Russell's Naval Architecture,

pp. 135-138. It is a cumbrous process at best.

by their sum. This, added to the length previously laid off on the first

ordinate, gives the area np to the third ordinate, and is set off upon

that, and so on. This gives the ordinates of a new curve,* which repre-

sents double the area of the first curve up to any given ordinate, original

or interpolated. The curve passes through the foot of the first ordinate,

because there is no area until that has been passed. If the curve is

incoiiveniently tall, it must be reduced by dividing all the ordinates in

the same ratio.

If the parabolic method is preferred, we divide the base into an even

number of intervals, and draw ordinates. Join the heads of all the odd

ordinates by right lines cutting the even ordinates (produced if necessary)

and divide the portion of the even ordinates included between the curve

and the chord into three equal parts. Then the distance from the base

to the point of division nearest the curve gives the area comjirised between

the adjacent odd ordinates. That is to say, it is the length of a strip,

whose base is the double interval, and whose area is equal to that of the
>corresponding curved area. The length thus obtained on the second

ordinate, is set off on the third : the length similarly obtained on the

fourth ordinate is added to that on the second, and the joint length laid

Weoff on the fifth.  thus obtain ordinates for a curve of areas ; only the

scale is one-fourth of what would be obtained by the previous process

ajjplied to the same curve.

It is very important to keep an accurate account of the scale. This

is best written along each curve : thus

       curve of lengths, one inch representing (say) 2 feet

       curve of areas, one inch representing           ,, 8 square feet

       curve of volumes, one inch representing               8 cubic feet
       =reduced curve of volumes, one inch             ,,

                                                       ,, 128 cubic feet.

The additions are best performed by setting off the lengths in                                                    suc-

cession on a straight-edged strip of paper. If only the total area is

required, the whole operation can be performed upon the strip.

If moments are required, the fii'st thing is to construct a curve repre-

rsenting the moments of the ordinates. Start from the foot of the first

ordinate (whose moment about itself is zero), take the head of the second

ordinate, double the third, treble the fourth, and so on. Integrate the

curve thus obtained, and we get a curve of moments, any ordinates of

which represent the moment of the area of the original curve up to that

--ordinate the moment being taken about the first ordinate. t The mo-

anent  may, of   course,  be  taken  about  any other  ordinate                                         but  the  new
                                                                                                     ;

ordinates on one side of the selected ordinate must be set off below in-

stead of above the base. The scale may be reduced at the first operation

by taking the multipliers 0, n, 2n, 3n, 4<n, &c., where n is a fraction,

instead of using 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.

If the curve of areas be again integrated from the foremost end, the

complete integral represents the moment of the original curve about the

final ordinate. This is a consequence of the formula (easily obtained by

integrating by parts)

                          = +x/y J.ii               l^y (^^

     t The moments must be taken about an ordinate, not about the base. If moments

hase.
                                       ON QUADBATURES AND INTEBPOLATION.  37

The interval used in tlie graphical process is quite immaterial provided
careful account be kept of scale. It is impossible to pay too much atten-

tion to tliis point.

It is, of course, not necessary that the original ordinates should re-

present lengths. They may represent areas, in which case their curve of

areas will represent volumes ; or they may represent pressures, in which

case, with a suitable interpretation of the interval, the areas will repre-

sent  work                             or, again, the integral of a curve of temperatures may
                                    ;

represent heat. Whether it actually does so, or not, depends upon what

is taken for the interval.

    What all these processes effect is mere summation with suitable

coefficients. The processes of multiplication or division, except by a
small integer, are not conveniently performed in this way. So, although
we get out the moments graphically, we must have recourse to arith-

metical division, to find the position of the centres of gravity, or of

gyration. Similarly, if we want to set off the squares, or the cubes, of
the ordinates, we must use a table of squares or cubes, and set off from

that.

      It is best to use printed or lithographed sheets divided into squares,

the interval being chosen with reference to the work to bo done. In
English shipbuilding work, which is usually drawn on a scale of :^-inch
to the foot, quarter-inch squares are the most convenient. There should
be a thicker rule at every fifth or tenth line, to prevent mistakes in

counting. Any sized square will do, only if the rigiit size bo chosen, it

saves, at least, one set of reductions. For mere quadratures, it is not
necessary that the lines should be exactly at right angles, but in cross-
measurements it is inconvenient to have the two diagonals measuring

different lengths.

     The intersections of curves drawn to the same scale solve graphically
a number of equations, differential and other, which it would be difficult
to treat otherwise. There is no difficulty in changing the independent
variable. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by the interchange

of X and y, by taking a fresh set of ordinates at right angles to the old

ones. But as there is no restriction to rectangularity, and as we may

measure to an inclined or even a curvilinear base, it is obvious that the

range of transformation is very wide indeed. An example of the appli-
cation of this to the problem of rectilinear motion in a resisting medium

will be found in the ' Phil. Mag.' for June, 1868. Neither of these points,,
however, falls strictly within the scope of this report, and therefore it is

unnecessary to enlarge upon them.
     As regards the accuracy of these graphical methods, the work, in the

Royal School of Naval Architecture was generally done from drawings

on a scale of ^-inch to the foot. The displacement got out correctly in
two ways used generally to agree within about ^ percent. If it exceeded
^ per cent., it used to be regarded as evidence of a blunder. As regards
blunders, graphical processes have the advantage of making these appa-

I'ent by a corner in the curves.

   --Polar quadrahtre of an area. It was pointed out to the author by the

late M. Normaud of Havre, that the polar quadratui'e could be very

rapidly applied to finding the area of transverse section of a ship's hold.

For this purpose the angles could be marked on a wooden quadrant held
vertically athwartships at the corner underneath a deck, and divided into
equal angular intervals, while a tape would pass from the centre of the

quadrant to the opposite side or bottom of the ship and 'would be made
to cover one of the divisions. The observed length of this tape being r,

Lhe integral / -)-r/J wonld give the area. The ·work might be still

further shortened by graduating the tape according to r^ instead of by

equal divisions. There would then remain nothing but the quadrature.
     This method might be conveniently applied geometrically in the case

-of curves having two axes of symmetry, like the ellipse, to which parabolic
quadrature is not ap|3licable. This is, however, only one of a very great
number of the possible transformations of the independent variable.

   --Length of a curve. Draw a chord between its extreme points, divide

the chord into equal parts and draw ordinates at the points of division,

.·at right angles to the chord. Draw tangents to the curve where these

'ordinates cut it, and let these tangents be produced both w^ays to meet
the ordinates at the extremities. Use the lengths of these tangents as
ordinates, and integrate them by any method of quadrature, dividing by

--the number of ordinates. The result will be the length of the curve.*
     Curved Surface. The only general method of dealing with this is first
to construct, and then to integrate between the requisite limits, sec ^ clx dij,
where <j> is the angle between the tangent plane and the base, or jjlane of
'(x,y). The construction of the term sec <j) for any given point is easy
enough, since this is simply the through diagonal of a parallelopipcd, of
which the base is given, and the directions of the diagonals of faces are
ailso given. The number of ordinates, however, for which this calculation
has to be made is large, being in two dimensions, and there is then a
sSonble integration to be performed. Moreover the limits are not neces-
sarily or usually constant, and then again the methods fail where the
surface is parallel to au ordinate, and in either of these cases the surface

ihas to be specially cut up, presenting in reality several different pieces of
work. All this renders it a very laborious task, and unfortunately the

integral for the surface does not present any such reductions, when treated
by ordinates, as the volume-integral.

     In iron shipbuilding, when the work is complete, and a separate

account is taken of every plate, the weight of skin and area of the surface
are of course mere matters of addition. But while the design is in draft,
it sometimes becomes necessary to estimate the surface in a more summary
5nanner. The usual mode is to obtain the lengths of all the level lines and
transverse sections of the surface, and then to expand the surface on th.e
flat by means of two sets of strips of paper, which secure equal lengths
for. the sides of the quadrilaterals, the angles being allowed to take iip

their own adjustment. This is a very coarse representation, even sup-

posing the expansion to be split where the distortion is great, as it usually
is where the skin of a ship meets the sternpost. This process is occa-
sionally modified by using an orthogonal network on the surface, instead
of orthogonally dividing the plan, and that is probably a little better.
Another more accurate plan has been given by Mr. Crossland f of the

Admiralty. A model of the ship is usually more convenient to work from

than drawings, although it is quite possible to get the constructioDS

without much difficulty from these. Nevertheless, it is a laborious and

nnsatisfactory process, and quite inapplicable to complex or highly curved
surfaces. It does, however, give a rough approximation, and, as such, is
found both useful and necessary by shipbuilders.

X. Mechanical Quadeatuees.

--ILectlfication. The only satisfactory mechanical means of doing this is

by running a wheel along the curve, and observing its travel. In the

opisometer it is done by starting the wheel from a stop, running it along

the path to be measured, and then applying it to the scale of the majD or

diagram, and running it backwards until the stop is felt. This saves the

trouble of any readings, except the final one upon the scale, and it also

avoids all conversion of scale. It may be objected to it that it is a little

wanting in minute accuracy, from a small yielding at the stop giving a

considerable error at the edge of the wheel. This, however, can easily be

tested on a plain scale, and careful use of the instrument with a delicate

hand gives very good results.

There is a more elaborate but very convenient form of the machine

sold under the curioi:s name of ' Wealemefiia.'

  --hired mechanical quadrature. If a disk revolve at uniform velocity,

and a friction wheel roll upon it, having its axis parallel to the plane, and

meeting the axis of the disk, then it is clear that the ti-avel of the friction

wheel will be directly pi'oportional to its distance from the centre of the

disk. If, therefore, the friction-wheel be made to slide upon the disk, so

that its point of contact shall be separated from the centre by a distance

equal to the varying ordinate of a curve, while the disk rolls along a straight

line base, the travel of the friction-wheel will integrate the area of the

curve. This is the simplest mechanical integrator there is. It is used in

one form as the ' continuous indicator ' in steam-engines, and in another
form it is used for integrating the curves of the German tide-gauges. It

is also used in the recording part of Moriu's dynamometer, and in Sang's

planimeter.

  --Javies Tliomsoris integrator. This ingenious instrument was devised

in order to get rid of the sliding which takes place ita the continuous

integrator, and in Amsler's planimeter. It consists of a plane circular

disk inclined at an angle of 45° to the horizon, and turning freely on

Aan axis normal to its plane.  cylinder with its axis horizontal and

parallel to the plane of the disk is mounted on journals in front of the

Adisk, so that they just clear one another. smooth sphei'e is dropped into

the trough between the disk and the cylindei", and the machine is so

adjusted that the sphere can just roll over the centre of the disk. The
amount of rotation of the cylinder as the disk turns through a given

angle, will vary as the distance of the point of contact of the sphere and

disk from the centre of the latter. The travel of the sphere laterally is

obtained by means of a fork, -which is made to slide in the direction of the

axis of the cylinder, and which nips the sphere between two pads or

cushions, on which it slips easily. If now a flat templet with a straight

base and a curved edge opposite the base, is moved in the plane of the

disk and at right angles to the axis of the cylinder, so that the disk, or a

pinion in gear with it, rolls along the base, M'hile a pin in the fork-handle

follows the curve on the other side of the templet, the travel of th©
cylinder will effect the quadrature of the curve on the templet.*

     The use of the machine is by no means limited to this simple quad-

rature. By putting the fork in gear with the disk through the intervention

of suitable wheel or link- work, or belting; or by gearing two such
machines suitably together, it is possible to obtain the mechanical solution

of differential equations.

Sliding motion is not altogether escaped in this machine. In the first

place, there is sliding motion of the sphere in the fork. Further, the

rolling of the sphere along a small circle is not pure rolling, but, although

not having any actual sliding, is intermediate between sliding and rolling.

For if we separate the pure rolling along a great circle from the twist

necessary to make it describe a small circle, the aggregate of this twisting

is the same as we should get by turning the sphere through a definite

angle about an axis perpendicular to the disk                                                                                                                                                                                                      but instead of being finite
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

slidmg, as it would be on this last supposition, it is in fact distributed

over a line instead of concentrated at a point. It is thus infinitesimal

at every point of the line, along which, however, there ceases to be pure

rolling. J

     There is also a source of error in the necessity of giving some clearance

to the fork, which would otherwise not slide on the sphere. This clear-
ance introduces a slight error every time the fork reverses its motion. It
IS, however, a constant error ; but it is always in the same direction, and
is not compensated on a double reciprocation. This is the chief drawback
to the machine, which is nevertheless a most valuable instrument.

     ^??isZer'sjjZa)ime<er.--In this wonderful little instrument a pointer is

made to ran round the closed curve, which has to be measured, and a

little wheel, which partly rolls and partly slides, gives the area by th&

mere reading of its rolling motion. The main principle on which it de-

pends IS this                                                                      that if a finite right line moves in its own plane, the whole

area swept out by it is measured by the product of the length of the line,,
and by the sum of the components of the motion of the middle point

A(resolved at every instant) at right angles to the line.                                                                                                                                                                                          wheel turning

on an axis parallel to the line, and free either to roll or to slide on the

paper or plane, will effect this instantaneous resolution, and its reading

will integrate the required component. When one end of the bar makes

a complete circuit of a closed curve, coming back to the point from

which it started, while the other end reciprocates along an arc of any

fixed curve, Avholly external to the closed curve, the area of the latter is

given by the difference between the initial and final readings of the wheel.

In this case, moreover, the principle of the separation of the motions of

rotation and translation shows that the total reading of the friction wheel

^yill be the same, if it be moved from the middle to any other point of the

line, or even of the line produced. The only adjustment required, there-

fore, is that the axis of the rolling wheel should be parallel to the bar

which carries the pointer. This freedom from adjustment is one of the

most valuable properties of the instrument. As a practical matter, the

accuracy of the results which it gives is quite equal to that of the very best

drawings which can be made.

   --Amsler's Meclianical Integrator. By an ingenious extension of the

principle of his planimeter. Professor J. Amsler-Laffon, of SchafEhausen,

has consti'ucted a machine which, while a pointer describes a closed curve,

records simultaneously its area, its statical moment, and its moment of

inertia about a given axis. In this case the butt end of the bar which
carries the pointer is made to move along a right line. The area is read
off fi'om a wheel mounted on the bar itself, and this part of the operation

is thus the same as in the common planimeter. The moments are read off

from wheels mounted on arms whose centres also describe right lines, but
which are so geared with a wheel rigidly connected with the bar carrying

the pointer, as to turn relatively to it with the fixed velocity ratios of

2 : 1 and 3:1. Supjiosing the angular motion of the pointer-bar to be
y, and the velocity ratio n : 1, the quantity of rotation of the second

+circle will he nQ a, a being an arbitrary constant depending upon the

initial position. When the pointer goes round any closed curve which

does not contain the centre of the first circle, this measurement of this
rotary motion comes to nothing, for the angular movement is the same

forward as backward, and it may therefoi'e be left out of account. But

+its angle {n Q a) settles the direction of the resolution of which the

component is measured by the instrument, when there is linear motion of
the centre. The rolling wheel records a constant multiple of

                            -- +dx cos (?i Q a),

where dx represents the movement parallel to the axis, and its complete

record is

numerical factor, which is one of the constants of the instrument.

moment of inertia and a fixed multiple of the area. In this way the
moment of inertia is known. The subtraction is not performed by the

machine, but is left to the calculator.*

I FEEL that I am indebted for the opportunity of giving an account of
the French expedition, which forms the subject of this paper, to my
esteemed friend and colleague, the Marquis de Folin, of Bayonne. He

was until lately the commandant of that port, and is a most zealous and

excellent naturalist. I may, indeed, say that the expedition originated

with him. For more than ten years he had, at his own expense, assi-

duously and carefully explored the sea-bed lying off Cape Breton, in the
Department of the Landes, as well as could be done in a fishing-boat
and the result of his researches among the marine Invertebrata has been
described, with illustrations by his pencil, in a useful work called ' Les
Fonds de la Mer,' published at Bayonne under his direction. M. de

Folin has from time to time sent me the MoUusca procured in his dredg-
ings for my opinion ; and our correspondence, with a visit which I paid

liim in December 1878, led to his making an application to the French
Government for the grant of a vessel to explore the depths which were
known to exist at a comparatively short distance from the northern coasts
of Spain in the Bay of Biscay. This evidently could not be done in a
fishing-boat ; and naturalists have much less money than science. It was, in
fact, a project for a nation, and not for an individual. The application was,
I believe, referred to the Dean of the Academy of Sciences, M. Milne-
J'Jdwards, whose reputation as an eminent zoologist has been universally
recognised for more than half a century. His report was favourable and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

a Government vessel was ordered to be placed at the disposal of a Com-
mission of which M. Milne-Edwards was appointed President. The other
members of the Commission were the Marquis de Folin, Prof. Alphonse
Milne-Edwards, Prof. Vaillant, Prof. Marion of Marseilles, Dr. Paul
Fischer, and M. Perier of Bordeaux. The selection of these savants

of the Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects for 1880. It will not
escape the reader that this machine requires several rather nice adjustments which

are not needed in the common planimeter. The machine, as actually made for sale
by Mr. Amsler, is very beautifully contrived, with regard to all its mechanical details,
and it works very smoothly and satisfactorily. Tlie cost is between £1G and £'2Q.

augured well for the success of tlie expedition, and it has been fully jns-

tified. At the suggestion of M. de Folin, the Minister of Public Instruc-

tion graciously invited mc and the Rev. A. M. Norman (a well-known

naturalist) to take part in the expedition. Mr. Norman had been my

valued companion for many years past in similar but less important

excursions to Shetland and Norway. It was to me a great jaleasure to

be again associated with him. I regarded the invitation as far more than

a compliment ; it was a great honour.

I may here mention that, immediately before the commencement of

the expedition, M. de Folin, Mr. Norman, and myself had some prepara-

tory boat-dredging in the Fosse de Cap Breton. This was done at the

expense of the French Government. When has our own Government

shown such generosity in the cause of science to French naturalists ?

The vessel assigned for the purposes of the expedition was the

TravaiUeur, a paddle-wheel steamer of over 900 tons, of 150 horse-power, :'

and carrying four guns. She is an aviso, or despatch-boat, and is stationed *

at Rochefort for occasional service. She was supplied with a capital

donkey-engine, and immense stores of cordage, sounding-wire, and other

apparatus. She had a very happy name, being an indefatigable worker.

Capt. E. LI. F. Richard was the commander, or lieidoiant de vaisseau, and

the other officers were Lieuts. Mahieux, Jecquet, Villegente, and Bourget,

Aide-Commissaire Gonsselin, and Dr. Duplouy. Let me now express my

sincere thanks to the officers for their great kindness and urbanity. They

took a great interest in the work, and materially promoted the welfare of

the expedition. The crew consisted of 128 men; the usual number was

between 80 and 90, but extra hands were taken in consequence of the

heavy work entailed by sounding during the night. All these men

seemed to be well-conducted, as well as good sailors ; and, although they
had only two meals a day, their physique was quite equal to that of our

best British seamen. Mr. Norman and I took with us, as dredger, a

steady and intelligent man, John Wilson ; and Prof. Marion had his dredger
named Armand. These men were of great use in sifting the material

brought up by the dredges. For the captain, T can only echo the opinion

expressed by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards in his preliminary Report, that

his arrangements were first-rate, and his skill admirable, e-specially con-

sidering that the kind of work was new to him, and that he had not

previously made or even seen any deep-sea dredging.

The members of the Commission assembled at Bayonne ; and the

TravaiUeur arrived there (3n the 16th of July. The next morning she

went to sea, with all the party on board except the President, Avho was

obliged to return to Paris, and might also have justly claimed exemption

from active service, being in his eightieth year. Until the 1st of August

(with the exception of two days, the 18th and 25th, which we spent at

San Sebastian and Santaudcr,) we were hard at work sounding, dredging,

and trawling. The weather was veiy fine, and the dreaded Bay of Biscay

lost its stormy character on tliis occasion.

The principal object of the expedition was to ascertain the nature of /

the fauna which inhabits at considerable depths this part of the Bay of i

Biscay and                                    this object was  thoroughly  and successfully accomplished.

Twenty-three dredgings were made for that purpose at depths ranging'

from 337 to 2600 metres, each metre being about 39 inches, or rather

more than half a fathom. The dredgings between 600 and 1000 fathoms

were the most important. Every department of the Invertebrata was

well represented, and novelties Tvei'e discovered in the MoUusca, Crus-

tacea, Echinoderms, Annelids, Actinozoa, and Sponges.

As regards myself, this expedition had a peculiar charm. Having

had the scientific charge of similar expeditions for the Royal Society in

H.M.S. Porcupine in 1869 and 1870, and in H.M.S. Valorous in 1875,

and having examined the collections made during the voyages of H.M.SS.

Shearivatfr and Challenger, as well as those made in nearly all the

Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, and American deep-sea and exploring ex-

peditious in the North Atlantic, I was naturally glad to participate in the

French expedition, and particularly as it embraced that part of the sea

which was at no great distance from the scene of my former labours in the

cruise of the Forcupine along the western coasts of Spain and Portugal, and

which cruise was so unusually productive. Impelled by this recollection,

I made last year a verbal and informal application to the late First Lord

· of our Admiralty, for the use of one of her Majesty's ships to explore

the Bay of Biscay this summer. The answer I I'cceived was very favour-

able                       but  the  pecuniary  resources  of  our  Government were  then  at a low
                        ;

ebb, and I was encouraged to renew the application when commerce

revived and times became more prosperous. I hope our new Govern-

ment will avail itself of the now improved finances, and not neglect this

genuine and beneficial method of instructing the nation, and maintaining

its credit for maritime discovery.

The fauna observed during the TravaiUeur cruise closely resembled

that which I ascertained during the Porcupine cruise of 1870 at corre-

sponding depths. This will be shown, so far as the Mollusca are concerned,

in the list of species appended to the jiresent paper ; and I have no doubt

that the other branches, when they have been worked out by the experi-

enced naturalists to whom they have been enti-usted, will confirm my

opinion.

In a physical and geological point of view this French exjiedition has

borne good fruit. No less than 103 soundings were made. They have

proved the existence, within a few miles of the coast, of a submarine valley

opening from the Fosse de Cap Breton and extending to a point opposite

Cap Fenas. The large diagram and chart which I now exhibit will give

a better explanation than I can do by any words. The diagram was pre-

pared for me                         when  I  presented  to  the  Royal  mySociety   rejiorts  of  the

Porcupine expeditions of 1869 and 1870 ; and the chart has been filled up

and given to me by my kind friend the Hydrographer.^ The striking in-

equalities of depth within a narrow area which thus appear were noticed

in a Bayonne newspaper of August 4 as ' des grands fonds sous-marins,

qui continuent sous les eaux de I'Atlantique les vallees pyreneennes.' As
a general role, it may be said that where mountains or high land apjiroach

the sea the depth of water is greater off that coast than where the land lies

low. But this must depend in a great measui'e on the geological nature

of the land adjacent to the sea. If the formation be granitic or gneissic,

the wear and tear or denudation must be slower than if the formation be

sandstone, cretaceous, or tertiary; and the action of rivers and streams on

the surface of the land must be proportionably increased or diminished, arid

cause the sea-bed to be more or less filled up in the course of time. Every-

where during the dredgings of the Travailleur in deep water the sea-bed
was found to be covered by a thick layer of mud, of a diflFerent colour from

Bay of Biscay.

that of the Atlantic ooze ; and this mud has probably accumulated from

untold ages by the incessant efflux of the Gironde, the Adour, and nume-

rous other rivers and streams into the Bay of Biscay. As may be supposed,
the fauna which inhabits such mud is very scanty ; and it required a con-

siderable amount of patience and perseverance to extract even a few

organisms from the unpromising material. No wonder that Dr. Carpenter

was discouraged, as a zoologist, by what he termed ' the singular barren-

ness of this deposit in regard to animal life,' when he described the

Mediterranean cruise of the Porcupine in 1870.

Within a few days after the retui'n of the expedition, Prof. A. Milne-

Edwards presented to the Academy of Sciences at Paris a preliminary

report of the zoological results of the expedition, which was published in

the Journal Officiel de la Bepublique Franq.aise as well as in the Comptes

Hendus. As most of the departments of the marine Invertebrata have

been so fully and carefully treated by him in this Report, I will content

myself with a few supplementary remarks as to the Mollusca, which

especially engaged my attention during the cruise. At the request of

Dr. Fischer, who will undertake this department, and with the sanction

of the President, I was entrusted with all the more critical specimens of

Mollusca                                                    and  these  specimens  I  have  now cleaned,  assorted, and  com-
                                                         ;

pared with my ow^n collection from the Porcupine Expedition of 1870 on

the western coasts of Spain and Portugal. I subjoin a complete list of

the Travailleur Mollusca, distinguishing in separate columns those

species which are Porcupine, those which were previously known to me

from Norway or the Mediterranean only, and those which I consider

new to science. The total number of the species in this list is 198,
out of which 169 are Porcupine, nine only appear to be exclusively

northern, one exclusively southern or Mediterranean, and seventeen

new to science. Two of the Porcupine species are northern also. The

results, especially in the last-mentioned category, are most noteworthy.

They serve to show how little we know of the deep-water Mollusca,
when we reflect that the area of the sea-bed lately explored, in a short

period of time and in a necessarily cursory manner, is but a very small

corner of the Atlantic, and that it would take many years to complete

the exploration so auspiciously commenced. The space traversed by

the dredge during this cruise represents probably much less than a ten-

thousandth part of the sea-bed lying between Cap Breton and Cap

Peuas : and our means of exploration by the dredge are by no means satis-

factory, pai-ticularly on muddy ground, of which the deep water zone is

mainly composed. Instead of our being able to scrape a few inches of the

surface of the sea-bed at considerable depths, so as to collect in the dredge

all the animals which inhabit the superficial layer, we find too often, to

our disappointment, that the dredge when it reaches the bottom sinks into
the mud from its own weight and from the momentum given to it by the

motion of the ship, and that it then acts as a subsoil plough and not as a

scraper. I must ask one of my engineering friends to devise some instru-

ment more efficient than the modern dredge.

Although it cannot be positively stated that the abyssal zone, or even

the benthal zone, is inhabited by species of Mollusca peculiar to it, some

species observed by me during the preparatory excursion to Cap Breton

and the Travailleur cruise bear out the statement to some extent. For

instance, Nuctda nitida, Dischides bijissus, Rissoa ahyssicola (a now inap-

propriate specific name), and Defrancia decussafa occurred only in the
--382 EErOET 1880.

shallow-water excursion, while Nncula corluloules, SipJiodentalium Olivi,
Rissoa deliciosa, and Defrancia hispidula occurred only in tlie deep-water

cruise.

     The list of MoUusca will show that several species are sujiposed to

have been drifted from shallow water. This may have been owing to

the proximity of the coast and to the consequent action of rivers and

tides.

      Several deep-water species of Mollusca occurred in this expedition
which had been until lately supposed to be extinct ; they are fossils of the

Upper Tertiaries of Europe.^

   A --curious provision of Nature if we may in these philosophical days
--use such a phrase was observable in the case of a deep-water mussel of

considerable size, which I propose to name Mytihis luteus. It inhabits the

layer of mud which I have above described, and moors or fixes itself by

means of a large and densely matted byssus which is spun by the foot.

This byssus is capable of being spread over a considerable extent of sur-

face ; and it not only prevents the mollusc sinking into the soft mud and

being smothered or buried alive, but enables it to feed comfortably on the

innumerable animalcute which swarm on the surface of the sea-bed. It
is to some extent of the same use to the mollusc as a snow-shoe is to the

Arctic traveller. This sjiecies of Mytilus I at first took to be the Modiola

=incurvata of Philippi M. MartorelU of Hidalgo--which lives on the south

coast of Spain in rather shallow water ; but on comjiarison I am satisfied

that they differ essentially in shape, sculpture, colour, and epidermis.

    I cannot conclude this account without tendering my most grateful

acknowledgments to the French Government for their extremely generous
conduct, and for the excellent hospitality which I enjoyed on board the
TravaiUeur, as well as to the President and members of the Scientific
Commission for their obliging and friendly companionship.

     The zoological results of this French expedition are fully equal to those
obtained by Capitaine Baudon in 1801, M. d'Urville in 1829, the Ee-
cherche in 1835, the Bonite in 1836 and 1837, the Astrolabe in 1841, and
other expeditions ; and I sincerely hope that a further expedition of the

present kind may take place next year in the Mediterranean, where our

good and gallant neighbours hp^ve such an important stake.

ox THE FRENCH DEEP-SEA EXPLOKATION IN THE BAT OF BISCAY.  387

                  --List of Mollusca continued.
388 REPORT-- 1880.

Porcupine to the entrance of the Bay of Biscay, was found to be the most

abundant species within the bay, though in size greatly dwarfed as com-

Apared with Norwegian specimens.            Thysanopoda, probably norvegica,

was taken several times abundantly, and was probably caught as the

dredge approached the surface. The large, most remarkable, and blood-

red Schizopod Gnatliopliausia Zoea, Willemoes-Sahm, which was dis-

covered in the Challenger Expedition near the Azores and off the coast of

Brazil, delighted us with its beauty. Many undescribed species were met

with. Pre-eminent among these were a new genus allied to Dromia ' a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

very curious new genus of Galatlieidce, which is blind, and has the eye-

stalks converted into spine-tipped processes; a new PalcBViouid, remark-

able for having its carapace girt with a ring of spines ; and a Scalpellum,

apparently new.

    Among the Gephyrea were two species recently described by Danielssen

and Koren, from the Norwegian coast, and not hitherto found further

south ; the grand Sipunmdus priapidoides, which is the largest and most

interesting species of the genus known to me ; and the curious little

Ochnesoma Steenstrupii. This latter species I dredged last year in great

abundance at the mouth of the Hardanger Fiord, Norway. A third

Gephyrean obtained is also perhaps the Phascolosoma scpiamatum of the

same authors.

In the Fosse de Cap Breton the curious Annelid, Siernaspis thalasse-

mo'ides, Otto, which was formerly refeiTed to the Gephyrea, was found

abundantly.

Several examples of the much- disputed Ghcetoderma nitidulum were

obtained. This is one of those animals which, exhibiting relationship to

more than one class in almost equal ratio, becomes, by its somewhat inter-

mediate characters, of special interest.

Only a single Polyzoon occurred. This was Triticella BoecMi, or an

allied species. It was infesting the crab Geryon iridens, on which same

host the species just named was discovered by Professor G. O. Sars.

There was a remarkable absence of Hydrozoa.

In no class is the collection finer than among the Actinozoa. Of

Actinians not secreting a corallum there were a new Pahjtlioa parisitic on

the spines of Cidaris papillata; an Actinia (^Adamsia?), parasitic on an

Isis ; and two or three other things which were not recognised by us.

Of corals there were Caryophyllia davits ; a Flahellum belonging to the
Flahelhim aperhim group, in which the corallum is little or not at all com-

pressed                                     a Deltocyathus, and Lophohelia prolifera.  Of Gorgonian allies
                                         ;

there were Gorgonia verrucosa, and at least two species of Isis, one of

which was of considerable size, and when dredged at night was gorgeously

phosphorescent, exhibiting a blaze of light. Of Virgularians there were

many fine species, including two large forms of Virgularia (or closely allied

genus) ; what appeared to be a Scytalium of very elegant form and bright

red, widely separated fins ; a genus which, from the curved, flaccid state

of the polyparium, appeared to be devoid of all calcareous axis ; Kopho-

ielemnon sfelliferum, and an example of the genus Umielhiria.^ This

genus, first discovered in the Arctic seas in 1753, and admirably figured

by old Ellis, was lost sight of for 120 years, when it was rediscovered by

Lindahl in the Swedish expedition between Greenland and Newfoundland.

       M. AlphoDse Milne- Edwards had previously seen this among the Crustacea
dredged by A. Agassiz in the Blalie, and proposes to name it Bioranodromia ovata,

     · Probably U. Thomsoid, Kolliker.
ON THE FRENCH DEEP-SEA EXPLORATION IN THE BAY OF BISCAY. 389

Subsequently the Challenger dredged it in several spots, and as far south,
as midway between Cape St. Vincent and Madeira. But the finding of
this most interesting animal within a few miles of the European coast by

Le Travailleur (July 30, in 1,160 metres) leads us to hope that hereafter

it may even be added to the British Fauna.

     Echiuodermata, as is usual in deep-sea di-edgings, were numerous. Of

Holotliuroidea there was a form entirely unknown to me furnished with

only two rows of suckers remarkable for their great size, and ten tenta-

cula ; a Molpadia, which has generally been regarded as an Arctic genus

and EcJiinocncumis ti/jnca, an abundant Norwegian type, of which the pre-

Asence in the Bay of Biscay was evidenced by a single specimen.  curious

instance occurred of the meeting in the Bay of Biscay of species hitherto

supposed to be confined to Scandinavia with others regarded as eminently

Mediterranean. The trawl had been down in 306 metres, and when taken

up out of it rolled one or two hundred huge Holothurians, each about
a foot long. It was at once evident that they belonged to two species, and
further examination proved about two-thii'ds of them to be the rosy-coloured
HoIotJncria tremula of Norway, and the remainder, known at a glance by

their light brown colour and flattened side, were Stichopus regalis of the

Mediterranean. They had apparently met on this neutral ground, and

were living together on the most amicable terms.
     Sea Urchins were represented by Echinus microstoma, Wyville Thom-

son Calveria hystrix (or an allied species), of which several fine specimens
                   ;

occurred; Pourtalesia Jeffreysi ; and a new Spatangoid, remarkable on

account of its globular form, and referable perhaps to the genus Agassizia.

Starfishes were not numerous in species, and gave us nothing new.

Arcliaster tenidspina and hifrons, Astropecter Andromeda, and Brisinga

coronata were the rarer forms.

    The Brittle Stars were of much importance, for though the number of
examples was not great the number of species, and perhaps of new forms,

was considerable. The Ophiuridans require attentive study, and cannot

be determined at a glance. It will suflBce, therefore, to say that there

were many which were not familiar to me, belonging apparently to the

genera Asteromjx (parasitic on Isis, rather small, and possibly distinct from

Loveni), Ophiomusium, Ophiacantha, Ophioscolex, together with a remark-

ably large and fine form which I was unable to refer to any genus known

to me. An Ophiurid was also met with which I had discovered last year

in Norway, and which I propose to name Amphiura Danielsseni.

Sponges, both with respect to the number of species and of specimens

obtained, were scarce. Thenea muricata, Bowerbank {=WyviUethom-

sonia Wallicliii, P. "Wright) and Holtenia Carpenteri, W. Thomson, only

occurred in a young state ; and a little bunch of the strong coarse spicula

of the great Askonema Settihalense, Kent, came up wrapped round the

dredging line ; a single Hyalonema Imsitanicum, Bocage, was dredged in

about 600 fathoms ; and a fine, though dead, specimen of Farrea or Lefroy-
ella was procured, though unfortunately in fragments.

The Foraminifera of course could not, from their minute size, be

examined as they were dredged, but among the larger forms noticed in

the sieves were many very interesting and recently described types.

Foremost among these were the largest and most perfect examples of the

beautiful Orhitolites temiissimus, Carpenter, I had ever seen ; they equalled

a sixpence in size, and were dredged in about 1200 fathoms (July 20) ;
and the very remarkable thread-like Bathysiphon filiformis, G. O. Sars,
--390 BEPOKT 1880.

which had, as far as I am awai'e, only before been met with in the Nor-

--wegian fiords. Arenaceous forms were abundant and fine, and included

the following recently described species :

                       Ehabdammina abijssontm, M. Sars.
                        Myperammina ramosa, H. B. Brady.
                         Saccammina spliCBrica, M. Sars.

                            PsammosplicBra fusca, Schultze.
                              StortJiosphcera alhida, Schultze.

                        Astrorhiza arenaria, Norman.
                        Lituola suhglohosa, M. Sars.
                         Gyclammina cancellata, H. B. Brady.

     In concluding these rough notes, I must express the deep sense I en-
tertain of the kindness, courtesy, and attention which we received from
the French naturalists who were members of the Commission, and also
from Captain Richard and all the officers of Le Travailleur.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William
    Thomson, Dr. J. Merrifield, Professor Osborxe Reynolds,
    Captain Douglas GtALTon, j\Ir. J. N. Shoolbred {Secretary), Mr.

         .

   J. F. Deacon, and ]Mr. Rogers P'ield, appointed for the purpose
   of obtaining information respecting the Phenomena of the
   Stationary Tides in the English Channel and in the North Sea ;
   and of rejjvesenting to the Government of Portugal and the
    Governor of Madeira that, in the opinion of the British Associa-
    tion, Tidal Observations at Madeira or other islands in the North

    Atlantic Ocean tvoidd be very valuable, tvith the view to the ad-
    vancement of our knowledge of the Tides in the Atlantic Ocean.

In their last report the Committee requested, that the thanks of the
Association be conveyed, to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the
 President of the Board of Trade, the French Minister of Public Works,
 the Belgian Minister of Public Works, to the several authorities and

 private individuals, both in this country and on the Continent, who have,

 gratuitously aided in obtaining tidal observations for the Committee and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 especially to the French Association for the Advancement of Science for
 the cordial support and assistance it has always afforded to the Committee
 in cai'rying out its task. As this recommendation came too late to be

 given effect to at the Sheffield Meeting, the Council during the past year,

 in its own name, performed this pleasing duty.
      At the Sheffield Meeting, the further consideration of two points in

 particular was urged upon the Committee : 1st, the great utility of a re-
 cognised datum suitable for international observations, similar to the one
 made use of by the Committee ; and 2ndly, the benefit likely to accrue to
  science, if the various maritime Governments, of Europe especially, were
  to arrange among themselves to carry out a lengthened series of tidal
  observations, and extending over a considerable area of coast.
ox THE rnEKOMENxi. OF STATIOXAEY TIDES IX THE EXGLISII CHANNEL. 391

The Committee, having carefully considered these points, and as tliey

cordially agreed in them, urged the Council to press them upon the several

Governments with whom they were communicating, respecting the labours

of this Committee. It having also been pointed out, that, although the

form in which the tidal observations as presented in last year's report

(referred all to the English Ordnance Datum, and to Greenwich time)

was most suitable for all observers on this side of the Channel, yet that it

was hardly so for those on the Continent who had taken part in those

observations, the Committee therefore decided upon reducing all the

observations to the French official Datum of levelling and to Paris time..

A pamphlet containing these tables, and prefaced by a special report in

the French language, has been prepared for presentation to each of the

foreioTi Governments, and observers on the Continent ; and copies of it

were transmitted through the Council with the thanks of the Association

Aas above referred to.  copy of this document is appended hereto.

It is with much pleasure that the Committee have to report that the self-

recristering tide-gauge, which, at the instance of this Committee, the Board

of Trade established on the Admiralty Pier at Dover, has been working,
Aapparently with satisfaction, for neai-ly twelve months.
                                                           valuable series

of tidal records may, therefore, now be commenced at this important
station. This is highly desirable ; and it is a measure which the Com-

mittee would strongly urge upon the Board of Trade. Seeing that

similar self-registering records have been most carefully collected for some-

time back at Ostend, at Dnnkerque, at Boulogne, and at Havre, on the

opposite coasts ; while on our own side, already, self-registering gauges-

exist at Sheerness, at Ramsgate, and at Portland.

The self-registering tide-gauge at Madeira, which the Portuguese

Government, at the instance of H.M. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, acting

on the request of this Committee, sent out to the Bay of Funchal, has

been recently erected, and, it is understood, will soon be working

satisfactorily.

     The Committee beg to report that the sum of £10 has been expended

in the preparation, pi-inting, and distribution of the pamphlets to foreign
observers. They request that the Committee be reappointed, with a

grant of £10 to cover these expenses.

     Douglas Galtox, et M. James N. Shoolbeed (Secretaire et Eaj)-

      porteur).

Au Congres de Plymouth, en 1877, une Commission a ete nommee par

I'Association Britannique dans le but indique ci-dessus ; et aussi pour
prier le Gouvernement Portugais, par I'intermediaire du Gouvernement de
sa Majeste Britannique, d'entreprendre un serie d'observations sur les
marocs au Nord de I'Ocean Atlantique. Cette derniere demande a ete
392 BEPOET-- 1880.

gracieusement accordee par le Gouvernement Portugais ; et afin d'obtenir
les observations d'une maniere reguliere, un maregraphe enregistreur

(systeme de Sir W. Thomson) a ete installe dana la Baie de Fnnchal des

lies de Madere.

    Avant d'entreprendre des observations simultanees dans la Manche et
la Mer du Nord, la Commission s'est adressee, par les soins de son secre-

taire, aux membres de 1' Association Fran^aise pour I'avancement des

Sciences, qui a I'epoque du Congres de Plymouth etaient reunis au Havre.

Un raemoire y fut presente de sa part, exprimant ,le desir de voir sa pro-

position acceptee, et demandant, dans I'interet commun de la Science, nn

bon accueil de I'Association Fran9aise, et son appui aupres du Ministre

des Travaux Publics a Paris.

   Grace aux demarches qui furent faites plus tard par M. le Secretaire

du Conseil de I'Association Fran9aise, M. C. M. Gariel, aupres de M. A.

Rousseau, Directeur du Departement des Routes et de la Navigation au

Ministere, son Excellence le Ministre des Travaux Publics a bien voulu

donner I'autorisation necessaire, en ce qui concernait les observations a

faire sur les cotes de la France : et elles furent confiees par M. Eousseau

a MM. les Ingenieurs des Fonts et Chaussees, attaches aux ports de Mer

de la Manche.

   Une semblable permission fut gracieusement accordee par son Excel-

lence le Ministre des Travaux Publics de Belgique, grace a I'intervention

bienveillante de M. le Chevalier Mans, Inspecteur General des Fonts et

Chaussees, a Bruxelles, pour les observations du mareographe enregistreur

(van Rysselberghe) a Ostende.

   Le Gouvernement de sa Majeste Bi-itannique accorda aussi la meme

permission, et se chargea de faire les observations necessaires a certains

endroits sur les cotes septentrionales de I'Angleterre. Plusieurs par-

ticuliers voulurent bien aussi se charger de faire des observations aux

endroits indiques, aussi bien en Hollande qu'en Angleterre.

   Le programme suivant fut ensuite dresse pour regler une serie d'ob-

servations simultanees en 1878, dans les mois de Fevrier, Mars, Avril,

Juin, et Aout.

   Pendant le premier trimestre, ce furent les marees d'equinoxe qu'on

voulait etudier ; et dans les deux derniers mois les marees ordinaires.

L'etendue des cotes du Continent comprises dans le programme s'etend

depuis le Havre jusqu'a I'entree du Canal de la Mer du Nord, qui conduit

a  Amsterdam                                                          et en  Angleterre,  depuis  Portland,  en face  du Havre,
                                                                   ;

jusqu'a Yarmouth, situe a pen pres en face d'Amsterdam.

   Dans le tableau comparatif qui suit, aussi bien que dans les courbes

qui I'accompagnent, on n'a represente que les marees d'equinoxe, qui ont

ete observees sur tons les points a la fois, dans le courant du mois de

Mars. II pent servir de type a celles des mois de Fevrier et d' Avril, ou

les marees observees ont presente une grande concoi-dance avec celles qui

sont dans le tableau.

   Les observations des mois de Juin et d'Aoiit de la meme annee, ainsi

que d'autres resultats qu'on espere retirer de cette etude preliminaire sur

les marees de la Manche et de la Mer du Nord, ne sont pas encore en etat

d'etre presentees avec ce rapport.

   La necessite s'est bientot fait sentir a la Commission de chercher un

plan de coraparaison commun, auquel toutes les observations pourraient

etre rapportees. Le seul moyen rationnel de comparer deux series de

nivellements operes des deux cotes de la Manche paraissait de se servir
ON THE PHENOMENA OF STATIONARY TIDES IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. 393

du niveau moyen de la mer ; et cette comparaison ne pouvait etre qu'ap-

proximative. En supposant, ea effet, que ' le niveau moyen de I'Ocean

Atlantique,^ donne par Bonrdaloue dans son nivollemeut general de la

France, represente le meme plan que le ' rnean sea level of the Ordnance

Survey ' donne pour les cotes d'Angleterre, on trouve qu'un plan passant
ii 5'50 metres en-dessous du zero de Bourdaloue coincide, aO'Ol metre pres,

avec celui qui est a 20 pieds au-dessous de T' Ordnance Datum' de la
Grande-Bretagne. En vue de I'approximation de laquelle on est force de
se contenter, cette erreur peut etre negligee. Ce plan de comparaison,

outre I'avantage des chiffres ronds qu'il presente, a encore celui-ci qu'il

n'y a que pen de basses mers d'equinoxe (meme danslaBaie de St. Malo)

qui descendent plus bas : et dans les observations qui sont a comparer
aucun de ces cas exceptionnels ne se produit.

     Dans le tableau, comparatif des observations qui suit on a done adopte
ce plan de comparaison pour les nivellements des deux cotes de la Manche.
Ceux de la Belgiqne et de la Hollande sont facilement rattaches au niveau,
·de Bourdaloue au moyen des nivellements de precision faits dans cbaque
pays. C'est sur cette hypotliese de la coincidence du niveau moyen de la
mer qu'a ete etablie I'echelle comparative qui suit (voir B,apport, 1879,

PI. XIII.).

     De I'examen attentif de ce tableau comparatif, on peut facilement con-

clure, que si sur une etendue considerable de cotes et pendant une duree
de temps plus longue, il se faisait d'une maniere reguliere une serie
d'observations simultanees sur les marees, soit de quart d'heure en quart

d'heure, ou meme peulement aux moments de la haute et de la basse mer,
on en retirerait probablement des resultats tres-importants pour la science :

tant au point de vue d'une connaissance plus exacte de ce qu'on apjielle

' le niveau moyen ' de la mer, qu'a celui des moments exacts des hautes et

des basses mers. On arriverait ainsi a se rendre meilleur compte des lois

de la propagation de I'ondemaree dans les mers et detroits qui entourent

nos cotes.
      Mais une telle serie d'observations ne peut etre enterprise par une

commission scientifique composee seulement de simples particuliers. Elle
doit etre la consequence d'un accord entre les divers gouvernements des
pays interesses : chacun d'eux devrait se charger des observations a faire

le long de ses propres cotes.

     On a vu, qu'il a ete necessaire, dans la redaction des observations qui

font I'objet de cette communication, d'essayer de resoudre le probleme

d'un plan de comparaison commun aux divers nivellements. L'importance

de ce sujet a ete deja reconnu plusieurs fois par diverses commissions
internationales. Si, a la suite des observations de maree ici rapportees,
chaque gouvernement avait la complaisance de presenter a la commission
 sa maniere de voir, soit sur le plan de comparaison choisi, soit sur tout
autre qui lui paraitrait jDreferable, ce serait un pas de gagne qui, lui seul,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 serait une recompense pour la commission en raison des travaux qu'elle a

enterpris.

      II ne reste plus aux membres de la Commission de I'Association

Britannique qu'a remercier, en leur nom personnel, les Gouvernements
Fran^ais et Beige, par I'intermediaire de leurs Excellences MM. le Minis-

 tres des Travaux Publics de chaque pays, aussi bien que le Gouvernement

The latest issued official accounts of the foreign and colonial trade of the

United Kingdom, together with those of the several preceding months,

bear testimony to a very considerable increase in the quantity and value

of both imports and exports. The figures in which these are set forth

have been received as evidence that a real revival of trade has set in, and

is about to extend beyond the bounds which have been reached in former

years. Such an analysis of these figures as may serve to indicate their

-- --real bearing on the welfare of the country both present and future will

not, therefore, be uninteresting, either to those engaged in trade or manu-

facture; nor to those who are any way concerned to understand the

jDOsition in which we stand, or that to which we may look forward.

It was during the sitting of the Bi'itish Association in the manufactur-

ing town of Sheffield last year, that the first gleams of returning prosperity

were distinctly seen. There had been for some months previously more fre-

quent appearances of ' paper ' in the London Money Market, of American

origin, which were taken as indications that there was a stir in American

trade ; and many proofs that the depression into which trade on the other side

of the Atlantic had fallen was passing away. Not a few hopes were expressed

that this country would in like manner emerge from the depth into which

its trade had fallen, so soon as prosperity was again brightening the pros-

pects of the United States. The receipt, therefore, of orders for various de-

-- --scriptions of our iron products and especially for rails was immediately

viewed as a precursor to manufacturing activity. Nor was the expectation

Aunwarranted by the results.  spirit of confidence at once sprung up,

and prices rose so high as to show that in addition to that which had a

sound basis, much speculative business was going on. Thus a stimulus

was given to production. Higher prices were asked and given, and for a

time there seemed to be no lack of buoyancy in almost every market.

Prices again gave way, but are now being partially recovered, and the

opinion is almost universally entertained that a new era of prosperity is

being entered upon. Such being the case it may be worth while to com-

pare a year's transactions with those of the preceding one. The early

date at which the monthly accounts are now issued from the Custom

House gives us the means of takmg for such comparison the twelvemonth

ended July 31 last witli those which came to a conclusion on the last day

Weof July in 1870.    can thus place side by side the figures for the worst

year of depression and the first year of recovery.

     Before entering into an examination of the details of the last two years,

--it may be well to state the totals for each year since 1871 that is, so far

back as they were     collected  on  the  same  system  as   now  exists                             and  to
                                                                                                  ;

ported, as follows :

the other may be ascertained for such portion of the exports, and it is not

likely that the proportions of the remainder -will vary greatly. Classifying

the articles so abstracted, and calculating how far the difference in value

is due to greater quantities or altered values, the foUo-wing results appear.

As before, in million pounds to two decimals :

iron figures for very nearly one-tbird of tlie whole year's gain, viz., 8-44Z.

out of 27Z., and cotton piece goods for 7-30Z., or one-fourth. Of the gain

in iron, one-tenth only is due to price, whilst cotton goods have sold for a

trifle less than the previous price. On the other hand, cotton yarn has

decreased in quantity but somewhat gained in price, and woollen piece

goods, though increasing 13 per cent, in quantity have fallen 4 per cent,

in price.

Taking the whole of the exports together, these figures establish the

fact that the very low prices of manufactured goods which prevailed in

the latter part of 1878 and the earlier part of 1879, have continued to

rule since that time ; and that for very nearly all the addition to the values

of that which left our shores before the revival, we have had to give extra

quantities, the advantage in point of prices obtained having been incon-

siderable. If, therefore, the business of selling has yielded any better

return, it must have been because the manufacturer received  less                    and  if
                                                                                  ;

the manufacturer gained at all, it must have been either from the lesser

value of money or a reduction in the wages of his labourers. Further, as

will be shown in dealing with the imports, in the cost of the raw materials

from abroad from which most of our textile fabrics are woven there has

been, especially in cotton, a decided increase.

     Turning now to the imports, and separating those retained at home
from those re-exported, we find a total value of about 347,000,000^, as

against 293,000,000^. in 1879. Abstracting, as with the exports, the chief

articles, and classifying them according to their uses, the following figures

present themselves :
440 REPORT-- 1880.

    As "witli the exports, these selected articles form about two-thirds of
the whole of the importations retained for home consumption or manu-

--facture namely, 238 millions out of 347 ; but they absorb more than that
--proportion of the increase over the previous year namely 44 out of 54,

which is equal to four-fifths.

Coming to details, it will be seen that this increase of 43*80 is 22^ per

cent, on the value of the previous year, whereas on the exports it was not

much more than 15 per cent., from which it is clear that the value of the

additional goods received for home use has exceeded that of the deliveries

for sale abroad in the proportion of very nearly 3 to 2. Of this amount

30-711., or 70 per cent., is owing to the quantities having been greater, and

13"09L, or 30 per cent., from better prices having been obtained.

The first division in the foregoing table, consisting of food, with which

are included beverages and tobacco, is by far the largest, taking more

--than one-half of the ax-ticles 150 millions out of 239; and its share of

the increase for the year is nearly in the same proportion (22^ out of 44),

the increase itself being 17^ per cent, beyond last year's supplies. In the

I'aw material for textile manufactures 61'35l., which is rather more than

a fourth of the whole, shows an increase over last year of 15"71Z., equal to 34

per cent. In the remaining class, including the principal metals, wood

and leather, 27"33Z., comprising one-sixth of the whole, the increase in the

year is 6'59Z., or 26 per cent. Dividing then the surplus between volume

and value, it appears that the increase of food has been 60 per cent.,

in textile materials 77 per cent., and in the others 91 per cent, on the

quantities. So, in respect to the prices paid, which have been 40 per

cent, on food, 23 on textile materials, and 9 per cent, on metals, &c.

     It needs no very close observation of these figures to discover the

--marked contrast they present to those for the exports in that, whilst

those showed the rise of prices to have been comparatively little, these

manifest a decided advance, particularly in almost every article of food

Weproper.  have not only consumed more, but that consumption has

been more costly, as well as more abundant. In proof that this is really

the case, two articles may be singled out, sharing between them in nearly

--equal portions rather more than half the whole increase in outlay. These

are wheat the food for the body, that on which more than on anything

else wo depend for the power to manufacture ; and cotton, the food for

our mills, on which vastly more than on any other article we depend for

the maintenance of our power to produce that which we can exchange for

food. Of wheat we have consumed within the j'ear, or are storing up

for consumption, that which has cost us 12,000,000L more than in

the previous year ; and of this amount 7,000,000Z. has been spent because

our growth at home was deficient in quantity, and 5,000,000Z. because

that deficiency enhanced the price the consumers have had to pay. Of

cotton wool we have imported and kept that which has cost us 10,500,000Z.

and of this 7,250, OOOZ. has gone to provide the additional weight, and

3,250,000/. the extra price at which it has been procured. Of this addi-

tional cotton as nearly as possible one-half has gone away again in the

shape of manufactured goods, the other half being added to the stocks on

band, or consumed for home purposes.

Thus far we have been considering the articles in which the country

has traded, and the money value they represent ; but an important branch

of the inquii'y relates to the countries with which that trade has been.
ON THE KECEXT REVIVAL IN TRADE.  441

carried on, and the altered conditions in -which it stands. The figures
that may serve to illustrate these points are not so complete as those -with
which -we have been dealing, tor it is only at the close of each year that
the necessary accounts are published, and these do not show the trans-
actions of the respective months which must form a portion of any period
ending otherwise than on December 31. The quarterly accounts furnish

materials for compiling the value of the -whole imports for the twelve-

month ending in Jiine, but not for those re-exported ; and those for the
exports contain only the values of British produce and manufacture.
From these data, ho-wever, it is possible to obtain a pretty clear idea of
the directions which the trade has been taking, and the differences bet-ween
its progress during- each of the t-welvemonths completed on June 30, 1879
and 1880.

     The following is a condensed account of the value of the United
Kingdom manufactures which have been exported to the British posses-
sions and foreign countries.
--442 BEPOKT 1880.
ON THE RECENT EEVIVAL IN TRADE.  443

 lience the doubts so freely expressed at the present moment wlietber a
 drain of gold may not soon set in.

       Secondly, it is evident that on the whole the prices obtained for our
 exports are only to a trifling extent better than they were, whilst the
 prices paid for our imports are considerably enhanced. Thus the revival

 has been much more to the advantage of the sellers of the goods we have
 consumed than to that of those who sold our own produce or manufacture.

 In the complicated state of trade transactions it is impossible to say whether

any or how much of this advantage belongs to our merchants, since this
 depends upon the ownership at the time when the sales are effected. As

 between the actual producers and consumers it is clear that a higher rate

 of payments for imports, with nearly stationary receipts for exports,
 cannot increase the prosperity of either one or the other. It would seem
 to be the case that sales are effected because prices are low, and that

 purchases are made because we need them although prices are high.
 Take, for instance, the fact that the cotton used up in the manufacture

 of our piece-goods has failed to bring in the higher price which the
 advanced cost of the raw material would justify or require.

      Thirdly, the whole excess in the value of the exports is scarcely equi-

valent to the extra cost of the food we have imported. Unless we can
 suppose that large stocks of produce and manufacture, or the means of

producing them, are prepared for future sale, in readiness to obtain a

profit when parted with, it follows that, as a whole, all the gain of extended

foreign outward trade has but gone in the sustenance of those by whom

the goods have been produced, leaving nothing Avherewith to recompense

capital or for the accumulation of wealth.
      This brings us to the really important consideration whether the food

question is not truly at the bottom of the recent fluctuations in trade.

For a series of years our own supplies have been scanty, and the bad
harvest of last year rendered us more than ever dependent upon the pro-

duce of foreign countries, particularly of America. Purchasing largely
from the Western growers, and giving them remunerative prices, they
have large profits to expend iipon our manufactures. Encouraged by
the successiv^e annually increasing quantities they were able to sell, they
have been laying themselves out to meet our wants, and, anticipating an
ever-growing call for their produce, they have determined by means of

new railways to bring larger quantities, and at lesser cost, from the distant
fields in the West to the seaboard in the East. Hence the sudden demand
for rails and for the iron to make them which the pits and the mills of
their own country could not supply, but which the diminution of prices
here enabled them to obtain sufficiently low to counteract the otherwise
prohibitory duties of their own tariff. Trade thus started in one direction
speedily spread in others, and thus extended far beyond the boundaries
in which it emanated. The repeated adversities of former years have

caused the depression of 1878-9 to be greater than the causes warranted,

and with the changes of last autumn confidence became restored, and this

of itself creates trade.

     The supposition that this revival is greatly owing to the failure of our
home crops derives much confirmation from the fact, that whilst the best
authorities estimate the diminished growth of wheat last year at from five
to six million quarters, worth some eleven or twelve millions of money,
our purchases of corn from the United States alone were fully that amount
in excess; to compensate for which they took from us iron and other
--444 EEPOET 1880

metals and textile manufactures together to the value of twelve millions

Wemore than in 1878-9.  have here a beautiful illustration of the way
--in which Nature rather let us say the Author of Nature's laws, the Divine

Ruler, who orders the course of Nature for the welfare of His creatures

counteracts one disturbing element by the restorative jiower of another.

"When the fertilising influence of the sun's heat failed us last year, vege-

tation languished and our fields failed to yield their accustomed supplies.

From whence did relief come but from the latent heat, which ages back

became imjsrisoned in the depths of our coal-pits, being brought forth and

utilised for the production of those manufactures wherewith we purchased

com elsewhere ? Where can we look for a more convincing argument in

favour of free trade than is to be found in the blessings it pi'ocured for us

in permitting this unrestricted exchange of the commodities absolutely

necessary to our existence, and of special importance to our brethren in

America ? Whilst we sympathise with our agriculturists in the loss of

their Substance and the severe trials which they are enduring, let us rejoice

that the evil was stayed from spreading to our manufacturers and traders,

and thereby involving them in the like suffering. Let us not, however,

Abe led away by undue expectations for the future.  good harvest at
--home still more a succession of them, if combined with greater produc-
--tiveness abroad would so far depress prices as to lessen the purchasing

power of the food-growers at home, whilst we shall not need to buy so

lai'gely from abroad. Thus those who have latterly supported our markets

will fail to purchase as they have done, and if our maniifacturing industries

are to be sustained we must not rely on a repetition of the demands that

have latterly been made upon them.

There is too much danger at present that we shall drawn into wild

speculations and expectations, such as led up to the fictitious prosperity

of seven years back, and culminated in the depression of more recent

years. Let us not delude ourselves with the belief that the inflation of

--1871-3 is about to return that fortunes are going to be made as rapidly

as then, or wages to rise to the same level. Let us not, however, give

way to gloomy fears. Cheap food will foster cheap production, and,

though our old customers may under its influence be enabled to supply

their own wants, there are new races of purchasers to be found or called

into being, and new homes to be founded by those who are cumbering the

ground here rather than tilling it in the distant parts of the Empire.

The judicious transferal of much of our capital and labour to places abroad,

where there is ample room for its profitable employment, together with

-- --greater thrift individual, family, and national at home, are the true

sources on which to rely for the maintenance or restoration of our manu-

facturing and commercial supremacy.

--Pkesidext of the Section Professor W. Gkylls Adams, M.A., F.R.S.,

                                                         F.G.S., F.C.P.S.

                         THURSDAY, AUGUST 26.

The President delivered the following Address :

It has been said by a former President of this Section of the British Association
that the President of a Section ought to occupy your time, not by speaking of

himself or his own feelings, but by a re\-iew 'more or less extensive of those
branches of science which form the proper business of this section.' He may give a
rapid sketch of the progress of mathematical science during the year, or he may

select some one special subject, or he may take a middle course, neither so extensive

as the first nor so limited as the second.

    There are many branches of science which have always been regarded as pro-

perly belonguig to  our  Section,  and  the range  is  already  wide                            but it  is  becoming
                                                                                             ;

more and more true every day that the sciences which are dealt with in other

sections of the Association are becoming branches of Physics, i.e. are yielding results

of vast importance when the methods and established principles of Physics are

applied to them. I wish to direct your attention to investigations which are l)eing

made in that fertile region for discovery, the ' border land ' between chemistry and
physics, where we ha'se to deal \\ath the constitution of bodies, and where we are

tempted to speculate on the existence of matter and on the nature of the forces by

which the difiereut parts of it are boimd together or become so transformed that

all resemblance to their former state is lost. It is not long since the theory of

exchanges became thoroughly recognised in the domain of Radiant Heat, and

yet so rapid is the progress of science that it is already recognised and accepted

in the theory of Chemical combination. Just as the molecules of a body which

remains at a constant temperature are continuously giving up their heat-motion to

surroimdmg molecules, and getting back from them as much motion of the same

kind in return, so in a chemical compound which does not appear to be undergoing

change, the combmiug molecules are continuously giving up their chemical or com-

bining motions to surrounding molecules, and receiving again from them as much

Wecombming motion in return.       may say that each molecule is, as far as we can

see, constantly dancing in perfect time with a partner, and yet is continuously

changing partners. When such an idea of chemical motion is accepted, we can

the more easily imderstand that chemical combination means the alteration of

chemical motion, which arises from the uitroduction of a new element into the space

already occupied, and the consequent change in the motion of the new compound as

Werevealed to us in the spectroscope.   can also the more readily understand that

in changmg from the old to the new form or rate of motion, there may be a deve-

lopment of energy in the shape of heat-motion which may escape or become dis-

Wesipated wherever a means of escape presents itself            know from the experiments

of Dr. Joule and of M. Favre that as much heat is absorbed during the decomposi-

tion of an electrolyte as is given out again by the combination of the substances

composing it.
--448 REPORT 1880.

We are making rapid strides towards the exact determination of tliose relations

between the various modes of motion or forms of energy wliicli were so ably

shadowed forth, and their existence established long ago, by Sir William Grove in

his ' Correlation of the Physical Forces,' where, in stating the conclusion of his com-
parison of the mutual interchange of physical forces, he distinctly lays down the

principles of energy in this statement : ' Each force is definitely and equivalently

convertible into any other ; and where experiment does not give the full equivalent,

it is because the initial force has been dissipated, not lost, by conversion into other

unrecocnised forces. The equivalent is the limit never practically reached.'

The laws of Faraday, that (1) when a compound is electrolysed the mass

of the substance decomposed is proportional to the quantity of electricity which has

produced the change, and that (2) the same current decomposes equivalent quanti-

ties of different substances, i.e. quantities of their elements in the ratio of their

combinino- numbers, have given rise to several determinations of the relation between

chemical afhnity and electromotive force. In a paper lately communicated to the

Physical Society, Dr. Wright has discussed these several determinations, and has

given an accovmt of a new determination by himself. The data at present extant

show that when 1 gramme of hydrogen unites with 7'98 grammes of oxygen there

are about 34,100 units of heat given out, making the latent heat of dissociation of

1 o-ramme of water equal to 3797 units. The results obtained are compared with

the heat given out by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, and the value of

the mechanical equivalent of heat is deduced from these determinations.

The value of this mechanical equivalent obtained by Dr. AVright, which depends on

the value of Clark's standard cell, and therefore depends on the value of the ohm,

a'^rees fairly well with Joule's determination from the heat produced by an electric

current in a wire, but is greater than Joule's value as obtained fi'om his water-friction

experiments. This may be accounted for by supposing an error in the value of the

ohm or B.A. miit, making it too large by 1'5 or 2 per cent. Kohlrausch has also

made comparisons of copies of the B.A. unit with standard coils, and comes to the

conclusion that the B.A. unit is 1'96 per cent, too large. On the other hand, Pro-

fessor Rowland, in America, has made a new determination, and finds that accord-

ino- to his calculations the B.A. unit is nearly 1 per cent, too small. These

differences in the values obtained by different methods clearly point to the necessity

for one or more new determinations of the unit, and I would venture to suggest

that a determination shoidd be made under the authority of this Association, by

a Committee appointed to carry out the work. And it is not sufficient that this

determination shoidd be made once for all, for there is reason to think that the

resistance of standard coils alters with time, even when the material has been care-

fully selected. It has been fomid that coils of platinum silver which were correct

copies of the standard ohm have become so altered, and have their temperature

coefficients so changed, that there are doubts as to the constancy of the standards

themselves. Pieces of platinum-silver alloy cut from the same rod have been

found to have different temperature-coefficients. The value '031 for 1° 0. is given

by Matthiessen for this alloy, yet two pieces of wire drawn from the same rod

have o-iveu, one ·021 per cent, and the other -04 per cent, for 1° C. Possibly this

irreo-ularity in the platinum-silver alloys may be due to something analogous to

the secreo-ation which Mr. Roberts has found to take place in copper-silver alloys

in their molten state, and which Matthiessen in 1860 regarded as mechanical

mixtures of allotropic modifications of the alloy.

   A recommendation has lieen made that apparatus for determining the ohm

should be set up in London, and that periodically determinations be made to test
Athe electrical constancy of the metals and alloys used in making coils.
                                                                              com-

mittee should be authorised to test coils and issue certificates of their accuracy,

iust as is done by the Kew Committee with regard to meteorological instruments.

The direct relation between Heat and Chemical work has lieen established, and the

principles of Conservation of Energy been shown to Ije true in Chemistry by the

experiments of Berthelot and of Thomsen, so that we may say that when a system

of bodies passes through any succession of chemical changes, the heat evolved or

absorbed when no external mechanical effect is produced depends solely upon the
            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  449

initial and final states of the system of bodies, whatever he the nature or the

order of the transformations. The extension of this principle to the interaction of

the molecules and atoms of bodies on one another is of vast importance in relation

to our knowledge of the constitution of matter, Rir it enables us to state that each

chemical compound has a distinct le\el or potential Avhich may be called its own,

and that when a compound gives up one of its elements to another body, the heat

evolved in the reaction is the difference between the heat of formation of the first

compound, and that of the resulting product.

   We have become accustomed to regard matter as made up of molecules, and

those molecules to be made up of atoms separated from one another by distances
which are great in comparison with the size of the atom, which we may regard as

the smallest piece of matter that we cau have any conception of Each atom has

beeu supposed to be surrounded by an envelope of ether which accompanies it in
all its movements. The density of the ether increases rapidly as an atom is

approached, and it would seem that there must be some force of attraction betvreen

the atom and its ether envelope. All the atoms have motions of translation

in all possible directions, and according to the theories of Maxwell and Boltzmann,

and the experiments of Kundt, Warburg, and others on the specific heat of

vapours, in one-atum molecules iu the gaseous state there is no motion of rotation.

According to the theory of Pictet, the liquid state being the first condensation

from the gaseous state must consist of at least two gaseous atoms combined.
These two atoms are bound to one another through their ether envelopes. Then

the solid state results from the condensation of a liquid, and so a solid molecule

must consist of at least two liquid molecules, i.e. at least four gaseous molecules,.

each surrounded by an atmosphere of ether. M. Pictet imagines these atoms to be

centres of attraction ; hence in the solid with four such centres the least displace-

ment brings into action couples tending to prevent the molecule from tw^istino; as

soon as external forces act upon it. All the molecules constituting a solid wiil be
rigidly set with regard to one another, for the least displacement sets in action a

couple or an opposing force in the molecules on one another.

    Let us now follow the sketch which M. Pictet has given of changes which we

may consider it to undergo when we expend energy upon it. Suppose a solid body

is a't absolute zero of temperature, which may be regarded as the state in which the

molecules of a body are in stable equilibrium and at rest, the application of heat

gives a -sdbratory motion to the molecules of the solid, which increases with the

temperature, the mean amplitude of vibration being a measure of the temperature.

We may regard the sum of all the molecular forces as the specific heat of the body,

and the product of the sum of all the molecular forces by the mean amplitude of

the oscillations ; i.e. the product of the specific heat and the temperature will be

the quantity of heat or the energy of motion of the body. As more and more heat

is applied, the amplitude of vibration of the molecules increases until it is too great

for the molecular forces, or forces of cohesion, and the melting point of the solid is

reached. Besides their vibratory motion, the molecules are now capable of motions

of translation from place to place among one another. To reduce the solidto the

liquid state, i.e. to make the amplitude of vibration of the molecules sufficient to

prevent them from coming within the sphere of the forces of cohesion, requires a

quantity of heat which does not appear as temperature or molecular motion, and

hence it is termed the latent heat of fusion. The temperature remains constant until

the melting is complete, the heat being spent in bursting the bonds of the solid.

Then a further application of heat increases the amplitude of vibration, or raises the

temperature of the liquid at a rate depending on its specific heat until the succession

of blows of the molecules overcomes the external pressure and the boiling point is,

Anreached.  additional quantity of heat is applied which is spent in changing tlie^

body to a- gas, i.e. to a state of higher potential, in which the motion of translation

of the molecules is enormously increased. When this state is attained, the tempe-

rature of the gas again begins to increase, as heat is applied, until we arrive at a

certain point, when dissociation begins, and the molecules of the separate substances

of which the body is composed have so large an amplitude of vibration that_ the

bond which unites them can no longer bring them again into their former positions.

1880.       G
450 REPOET-- 1880.

Tlie potential of the substances is again raised by a quantity which is proportional

to its chemical affinity. Again, we may increase the amplitude of vibration, i.e. the

temperature of the molecules, and imagine the possibility of getting higher and

higher degrees of dissociation.

If temperature means the amplitude of vibration of the molecules, then we

might expect that only those bodies which have their temperatures increased liy

the same amount when equal amounts of heat are applied to them can possibly

combine with one another; and so the fact that the increase of temperature bears

a fixed ratio to the increase of heat may be the cause in virtue of which bodies

can combine with one another. Were other bodies to begin to combine together

at any definite temperature, they would immediately be torn to pieces again when

the temperature is even slightly raised, because the amplitudes of vibration of their

molecules no longer remain the same. This idea of temperature is supported by

the fact that a combining molecule of each substance requires the same amount of

heat to raise its temperature by the same number of degrees, the atomic weights

being proportional to the masses of the combining molecules. The celebrated dis-

covery of Faraday, that in a voltameter the work done by an electric cuiTent

always decomposes equivalent quantities of diflerent substances, combined with

the fact that in the whole range of the physical forces work done is equivalent to

the application of heat, is quite in accordance with the view that no molecule can

con}bine with another which has not its amplitude of vibration altered by the same

amount when equal quantities of heat are applied to both. As soon as we get

any divergence from this state of equal motions for equal increments of heat, then

we should expect that a further dissociation of molecules would take place, and

that only those which are capable of moving together can remain still associated.

Just as in the change of state of a body from the solid to the liquid, or from

the liquid to the gas, a great amount of heat is spent in increasmg the motion of

translation of the molecules without altering the temperature, so a great amoimt

of heat is spent in producing dissociation without increasing the temperature of the

dissociated substances, since the principle of conservation of energy has been shown

Weby M. Bert helot to hold for the dissociation of bodies.  may conveniently make

use of the term latent heat of dissociation for the heat required to dissociate a

unit of mass of a substance.

   We may thus sum up the laws of physical and chemical changes :

1. All the physical phenomena of change of state consist in the subdivision of

the body into molecules or particles identical with one another.

2. The reconstitution of a body into a liquid or a solid being independent of the

relative position of the molecules, only depends on the pressure and temperature.

3. Dissociation separates bodies into their elements, which are of diflerent kinds,

and the temperature remains constant during dissociation.

4. The reunion of dissociated bodies depends on the relative position of the

elements, and so depends on the grouping of the molecules. The atomic weight

being the mass of a molecule as compared with hydrogen, the specific volume, i.e.

the atomic weight di'V'ided by the density, is the volume or mean free ^x/<A of a

molecule.

Building up his theoi-y of heat on these principles, M. Pictet arrives at a de-

finite relation between the atomic weight of a body, its density, its meltmg point,

and its coefllcient of expansion, which may be stated thus

     Tlie -Nolurae of a solid body will be increased a? the temperature I'ises by an
amount which is proportional to the number of molecules in it, and in\-ersely as its

specific heat. At a certain temperature peculiar to each body, the amplitude of

the heat oscillation is suflicient to melt the solid, and we are led to admit that for

-all bodies the iutermolecular distance corresponding to fusion ought to be the same.

Tlie higher the point of fusion of a body, the shorter, on this theory, must be its

heat--\-ibrations. The product of the length of swiiu/ (the heat-oscillations) by the

temperature of fusion ought to ]x a constant number for all solid bodies.

   A comparison of the -^-alues of the various quantities invoh-ed in these state-

jnents shows a very satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment, from

T-hich it appears th.at the product of the length of swing by the temperature of

fusion lies between 3'3 and 37 for many substances. Not many values of the

latent heat of dissociation have been obtained. In order to determine it, say, for

the separation of oxygen and hydrogen, we .should have to determine the amount of

work required to produce a sparli in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, and to

measure the exact amount of water or vapour of water combined by the spark,

as well as the range of temperature through which it had passed after its forma-

tion. Very few such determinations have been made.

Our usual mode of producing heat is by the combination of the molecules of

different substances, and we are limited in the production of high temperatures, and

in the quantity of available heat necessary to dissociate any considerable quantity

of matter. If we heat vapours or gases, we may raise their temperatures up to a

point corresponding to the dissociation of their molecules, and we are limited in our

chemical actions to the temperatures which can be obtained by combining togetlier

the most refractory substances, as we are dependent on this combination for our

supply of heat.

The combination of carbon and hydrogen -^nth oxygen will give us high tem-

peratures, so that by the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe most of the salts and oxides are

dissociated. The metalloids bromine, iodine, sulphur, potassium, &c., are the results
of the combination of two or more bodies bound together by internal forces much

stronger tlian the affinity of hydrogen or carbon for oxygen, for approximately

they obey the law of Dulong and Petit.

For higher temperatures, in order to dissociate the most refractory substances,

we require the electric current, either a continuous current, as in the electric arc

from a battery, or a dynamo-machine, or, more intense still, the electrical discharges

from an electrical machine or from an induction coil.

     This electric current maj' be regarded as the most intense furnace for dissociating

large quantities of the most refractory substances, and the electric spark may be
regarded as something very much hotter than the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe, and

therefore of ser^^ce in reducing very small q uantities of substances which will yield
to no other treatment. The temperature of the electric arc is limited, and cannot

reach above the temperature of dissociation of the conductor, and in the case of the

constant current, which will not leap across the smallest space of air unless the
carbons have first been brought in contact, the current very soon cea.ses when the

point of fusion has l)een reached. Yet in the centre of the arc we have the gases of
those substances wliicli form tlie conductor ; and, as Professor Dewar has .shown,
we have the formation of acetylene and cyanogen and other compounds, and there-

fore must have attained the temperature necessary for their formation, i.e. the tem-

perature of their dissociation. The temperature of the induction spark, or, at least,

Weits dissociating power, is higher than that of the arc.  know that the spark

will pass across a space of air or a gaseous conductor, and we are limited by the

dissociation of the gaseous conductor, and get only very small quantities of the

dissociated substances, which immediately recombine, unless they are separated. If

the gases formed are of different densities they ^vill diffuse at different rates through

a porous diaphragm, and so may be obtained separated from one another. As the

molecules of bodies vifjrate they produce A'ibrations of the ether particles ; the period

of the oscillations depends on the molecules of the body, and these periodic -s ibra-

tions are taken up by their ether envelopes and by the lumiuiferous ether, and their
wave-length determined by means of the spectroscope. As the temperature is

increased, the amplitudes of oscillation of the molecules and of the ether increase,

and from the calculations of Lecoq de Ijoisbaudran, Stoney, Soret, and others,

it would appear that many of the lines in the spectra of bodies may be regarded

as harmonics of a fiuidamental ^·ibration. Thus Le3oq de Boisbaudran finds that

in the nitrogen spectrum the blue lines seen at a higli temperature correspond

to the double octave of certain vibration*, and that, at a lower temperature, red

and yellow lines are seen which correspond to a fifth of the same fundamental

vibration=!.

Tlie bright line spectrum may })e regarded as arising from the vibratory motions

Aof the atoms.   widening of the lines may Im produced at a higher temperature

by the backward and forward motions of the molecules in the direction of the

Aobserver.     widening of the lines may also he produced hj increase of pressure,

because it diminishes the free path of the molecules, and the disturbances of the

ether arising from collisions become more important than vibrations arising from

the regular vibrations of the atoms.

Band spectra, or channelled space spectra, more readily occur in the case of

bodies which are not very readily subject to chemical actions, or, according to

Professors Liveing and Dewar, in the case of cooler vapours near the point of

liquefaction.

The effects of change of temperature on the character of spectra is very well

illustrated by an experiment of M. Wiedemann with mixtures of mercury with

hydrogen or nitrogen in a Geissler's tube. At the ordinary temperature of the air

the spectrum   of hydrogen or nitrogen was obtained      alone                        but on heating the tube
                                                                                   ;

in an air-bath the lines of mercury appeared and became brighter as the tempera-

ture rose, and at the same time the hydrogen lines disappeared in the -wader portion

of the tube and at the electrodes. The hydrogen or nitrogen lines disappeared first

from the positive electrode and in the luminous tuft, and as the temperature rose

disappeared altogether. With nitrogen in a particular e.xperiment, up to 100° C,

the nitrogen lines were seen throughout the tube, but from 100° to 230° the nitrogen

lines appear towards the negative pole, and the mercury lines are less bright at the

negative than at the positive pole, while at about 230° C. no nitrogen lines appear.

The experiments of Koscoe and Schuster, of Lockyer and other observers, with

potassium, sodium, and other metalloids in vacuum tubes, from which hydrogen is

pumped by a Sprengel pump, also show great changes in the molecular condition of

the mixture contained in the tubes when they are heated to different temperatures.

The changes of colour in the tube are accompanied by changes in the spectrum. Thus,

Mr. Lockyer finds that when potassium is placed in the bottom of the tube, and the

spark passes in the upper part of it, as the exhaustion proceeds and the tube is slightly

heated, the hydrogen lines disappear, and the red potassium line malces its appearance

then as the temperature is increased, the red line disappears, and three lines in the

yellowish-green make their appearance, accompanied by a change in the colour of the

tube, and at a higher temperature, and with a Leyden jar joined to a secondary

circuit of the induction coil, the gas in the tube becomes of a dull red colour, and

with this change a strong line comes out in the spectrum, more refrangible than the

usual red potassium line. In this case, on varying the conditions, we get a variation

in the character of the spectrum, and the colours and spectra are different in different

parts of the tube. In Lockyer's experiments, at the temperature of the arc obtained

from a Siemens djaiamo-machine, great differences appear in different parts of the

arc : for instance, Avith carbon poles in the presence of calcium, the band spectrum
of carbon, or the carbon flutings and the lines of calcium, some of them reversed,

are seen separated in the same way as mercury and hydrogen, the carbon spectrimi

appearing near one pole and the calcium near the other, the lines which are strongest

near that pole being reversed or absorbed by the quantity of calcium vapour sur-

rounding it. On introducing a metal into the arc, lines appear which are of different

intensities at different distances from the poles, others are strong at one pole and

entirely absent at or near the other, while solne lines appear as broad as half-spindles

in the middle of the arc, but are not present near the poles. Thus, the blue line of

Kcalcium is visible alone at one pole, the 11 and lines without the blue line at the

other.

    AVe may probably regard these effects as the result, not of temperature alone,
but must take into account that we ha\e powerful electric currents which will act

unequally on the molecules of dift'erent bodies according as they are more or less

electro-positive. It would seem that we have here something analogous to the

segi-egation which is observed in the melting of certain alloys to which I have

already referred.

     The abundance of material in some parts of the arc surrounding the central

portion of it gives rise to reversal of the principal lines in varying thicknesses over
the arc and poles, so that bright lines appear without reversal in some regions, and

reversals or absorption lines without bright lines in others. The introduction of a

substance into the arc gives rise to a flame of great complexity with regard to colour

H KstroDp; lines. In the sun, tlie absorption bands and                                  are verj^ broad, but the

band 4226 is weak. Prof. Young, in liis observation of the lines of the chromo-

H Ksphere, finds that                               are strongly reversed in every important spot and in
                                               and

solar storms ; but the line 4226, so prominent in the arc, was only observed three

times in tlie chromosphere.

One of the most interesting features among the most recent researches in

Spectrum Analysis is the existence of rhythm in the spectra of bodies, as has been

shown by'M- Mascart, Cornu, and others, such as the occurrence and repetition of sets

of lines, doublets, and triplets in the spectra of different substances and in different

"parts of the spectrum of the same body. Professors Liveing and Dewar, using the

reversed lines in some cases for the more accurate determination of wave-lengths,

have traced out the rhythmical character in the spectra of sodium, potassium, and

lithium. They show that the lines of sodium and potassium form groups of four

lines each, which recur in a regular sequence, while lithium gives single lines, which,

including the green line, which they show really to belong to lithium, though it

was ascribed to caesium by Thalen, also recur in a similar way. In tliese three

metals the law of recurrence seems to be the same, but the wave-lengths show that

the whole series are not simple harmonics of one fundamental, although between

some of the terms very simple harmonic relations can be found. Between the lines

G Hand are two triplets of iron lines, which, according to Mr. Loclryer, do not belong

to the same molecular grouping as most of the other lines. In many photographs

of the iron spectrum these triplets have appeared almost alone. Also the two

triplets are not always in the same relation as to brightness, the more refrangible

being barely visible with the spark ; combining this with Young's observations, in

Gwhich some short weak lines near appear in the chromosphere 30 times, while

one of the lines of the less refrangible triplet only appears once, and with the fact

that in the solar spectrum the more refrangible triplet is much the more prominent

of the two, Mr. Lockyer is led to the conclusion that these two triplets are again

due to two distinct molecular groupings.

There is one difficulty which must be taken account of in connection with

Mr. Ijockyer's theory with regard to the production of successive stages of disso-

ciation by means at our command.

At each stage of the process there must be a considerable absorption of heat to

produce the change of state, and our supply of heat is limited in the electric arc

because of the dissociation of the conductors, and more limited still in quantity in

the electric spark or in the discharge through a vacuum tube, also we should

expect a recombination of the dissociated substances immediately after they have

been fust dissociated. Hence it seems easier to suppose that at temperatures whicli

we can command on the earth, the dissociation of molecules by the arc or the spark

is accompanied by the formation of new compounds, in the formation of which heat

and light, and especially chemical vibrations, would be again gi^en out, gi'\ing rise
to new spectra, rather than to suppose that we can reach the temperatures neces-

sary for successive stages of dissociation.

To the lines C, F, the line near G, and h belonging to hydrogen, which have

a certain rhythmical character, Mr. Lockyer adds Dg and KirchofFs line ' 1474,'

regarding  '1474                               (wave-length  5315-0)  as  belonging  to  the  coolest  or  most  complex
                                            '

form, rising to F at a higher temperature, which is again subdivided into C and G,

using the spark without a condenser, which again gives li with the spark and con-

denser, which is again split up and gives Dj, a more simple line than h, in the Chro-

mosphere. Professors Livemg and Dewar, on the other hand, trace a rhythmical

character or ratio between three of the brightest lines of the chromosphere, two

of which are lines ' 1474' and 'i' of Lorenzoni, similar to the character of C, F,

and h of hydrogen, and also trace a similar relation between the chromospheric line

FDj and ' 1474 ' to the ratio of the wave-lengths of and the line near G. They

infer the probability that these four lines are due to the same at present unknown

substance as had been suggested by Yoxmg with regard to two of them. The
harmony of this arrangement is somewhat disturbed by the fact that D3 lies on the

Gwrong side of ' 1474 ' to correspond with the line near of the hydrogen spectrum.

in a Lyrfo, and does not appear in Sirius. In passing from the white or hottest
stars to the yellow stars like our sun, the typical lines diminish in breadth and are

Kbetter defined, and becomes stronger relatively to H, and other lines appear. In

   mProfessors Liveing and Dewar have made considerable progress                        determining

the conditions and the order of reversal of the spectral lines of metallic vapours.

They have adopted methods which allow them to observe through greater thiclc-
nesses of vapour than previous observers have generally employed. For lower
mtemperatures tubes of iron or other material placed vertically                   a furnace were

used, and the hot bottom of the tube was the source of light, the absorption being

produced by vapours of metals dropped into the hot tube and filling it to a greater

or less height. By this means many of the more volatile metals, such as sodium,

thalhum, nidium, ciBsium, and rubidium, magnesium, lithium, barium, strontium,

and calcium, each gave a reversal of its most characteristic line or pair of lines,

i.e. the red line of lithium, the violet lines of rubidium and calcium, the blue line
of strontium, the sharp green line of barium (5535), and no other lines which can

certainly be ascribed to those metals in the elementary state.

     For "higher temperatures tubes bored out in blocks of lime or of gas carbon,

and heated by the electric arc, were used. By keeping up a supply of metal and

in some cases" assisting its volatilisation by the admixture of a more volatile metal,
such as mao-nesium, and its reduction by some easily oxidisable metal, sucJi as

mahimmiiun, or by a current of coal gas or hydrogen, they succeeded maintauiing-

a stream of vapour through the tube so as to reverse a great many lines. In this
way the greater part of the bright lines of the metals of the alkalies and alkahne

earths were reversed, as well as some of the strongest lines of manganese, alu-
minium, zinc, cadmium, silver, copper, bismuth, and the two characteristic lines of

iridium and of gallium. By passing an iron wire into the arc through a perforated
carbon electrode they succeeded in obtaining the reversal of many of the lines

of iron. In observing bright line spectra they have found that the arc produced

by a De Meritens machine arranged for high tenoion gives, in an atmosphere ol
hydrogen, the lines C and F, although the arc of a powerful Siemens machine doe.-*
not bring them out, and they have observed many metallic lines in the arc which
had not been previously noticed. The temperature obtained by the De Meritens

machine is thus liigher "than that obtained in the Siemens machine.

    From observations on weighed quantities of sodium, alone and as an amalgam,

introduced into a hot bottle of platinum filled with nitrogen, of which the pressure
was varied by an au--pump, they conclude that the width of the sodium lines
depends rather on the thickness and temperature of the vapour than upon the
whole quantity of sodium present. Very minute quantities diffused into the cool
part of the tube give a broad diffuse absorption, while a thin layer of compressed
vapour in the hot part of the tube give only narrow absorption lines. Professors
Livemo- and Dewar have observed the reversal of some of the well-known bands of
the oxides and chlorides of the alkaline earth metals. The lines produced by

mai-nesium in hydrogen form a rhythmical series extending all across the well-

Bknown group, having a close resemblance in general character to the series of

lines produced by an electric discharge in a vacuum tube of olefiant gas.

The series appears at all temperatures except when a large condenser is em-

ployed along with the induction coil, provided hydrogen is present as well as

magnesium, while they disappear when hydrogen is excluded, and never appear in

dry nitrogen or carbonic oxide.                                                             ^

From their experiments on carbon spectra they conclude with Angstrom and

Thalen that certain of the so-called ' carbon bands ' are due to some compound of

carbon with hydrogen, probably acetylene, and that certain others are due to a

compound of carbon with nitrogen, probably cyanogen.

     They describe some ultra-violet bands : one of them coincides with the shaded

hand P of the solar spectrum which accompanies the other violet bands in the

flame of cyanogen as well as in the arc and spark between carbon electrodes in the

nitrogen. All the bands which they ascribe to a compound of carbon and nitrogen

disappear when the discharge is taken in a non-nitrogenous gas, and they reappear

on the introduction of a minute quantity of nitrogen.

They appear in the flame of hj-drocyanic acid, or of cyanogen, even when

cooled down as much as possible as shown by Watts, or when raised to the highest

temperature  by  burning  the    cyanogen in nitric  oxide                         but  no  flames  appear  to
                                                                                ;

give these bands unless the burning substance contains nitrogen already united

with carbon. As the views of Mr. Lockyer with regard to the multiple spectra of

carbon have very recently appeared in the pages of ' Nature,' I need only say that

these spectra are looked upon as supporting his theory that the diffei-ent flutings

are trulj^ due to carbon, and that they represent the vibrations of difl'erent molecular

groupings. The matter is one of very great interest as regards the spectra of comets,

for the bands ascribed to acetylene occur in the spectra of comets without the bands

of nitrogen, showing that either hydro-carbons must exist ready formed in the

comets, in which case the temperature need; not exceed that of an ordinary flame,

or else nitrogen must be absent, as the temperature which would produce acetylene

from its elements would also produce cyanogen, if nitrogen were present.

Quite recentlj'. Professors Li^eing and Dewar have, simultaneously with Dr.

Iluggins, described an ultra-violet emission spectrum of water, and have given maps

of this spectrum. It is not a little remarkable that by independent methods these

observers should have deduced the same numbers for the wave-lengths of the two

strong lines at the most refrangible end of this spectrum.

Great attention has been paid by M. Mascart and by M. Oornu to the ultra-

violet end of the solar spectrum. M. Mascart was able to fix lines in the solar

Rspectrum as far as the line     (3170), but was stopped by the faintness of the

photographic impression. Professor Oornu has extended the spectrum still farther

to the limit (2948), beyond which no further effect is produced, owing to complete

Aabsorption by the earth's atmosphere.  quartz-reflecting prism was used instead

of a heliostat. The curvature of the quartz lens was calculated so as to give mini-

mum aberration for a large field of view. The Iceland spa prism was very care-
Afully cut.
             lens of quartz was employed to focus the sun on the slit. Ha\"ing

photographed as far as possible by direct solar light, Professor Oornu compared the

solar spectrum directly bj' means of a fluorescent eyepiece with the spectrimi of

iron, and then obtained, by photography, the exact positions of the iron lines

which were coincident with observed lines in the solar spectrum. M. Oornu states

that the dark absorption lines in the sun and the bright iron lines of the same

refrangibility are of the same relative importance or intensity in their spectra, indi-

cating the equality between the emissive and the absorbing powers of metallic

vapours ; and he thinks that we may get by the comparison of bright spectra with

the sun some rough approximation to the quantity of metallic vapours present in

the absorption layers of the sun's atmosphere. He draws attention to the abun-

-- --dance of the magnetic metals iron, nickel, and magnesium and to the fact that

these substances form the composition of most meteorites. M. Oornu has studied

the extent of the ultra-violet end of the spectrum, and finds that it is more extended

in winter than in summer, and that, at different elevations, the gain in length of

the spectrum for increase of elevation is very slow, on account of atmospheric absorp-

tioii, so that we cannot hope greatly to extend the spectrum by takhig elevated

observing stations. The limit of the solar spectrum is reached very rapidly, and

Uthe spectrum is sharply and completely cut ofi' at about the line (wave-length

2948). From photographs taken at Viesch in the valley of the Rhone and at the

Riftelberg, 1910 metres above it, M. Cornu finds the limits to be at wave-lengths

2950 and 2930 respectively.

In the actual absorption of bright line spectra by the earth's atmosphere,

M. Cornu observed among others three bright lines of aluminium, which M. Soret

calls 30, 31, and 32 (wave-lengths about 1988, 1930, and 18G0), and he found

that 32   could not  be                        seen  at     the distance of 6 metres                                                                                                                but on  using a collimator,
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and reducing the distance to 1|^ metres, the line 32 became visible, notwithstand-

ing the absorption of the                            extra  lens                      at 1 metre, line 32 was brighter than 31 ,                                                                            and
                                                                                   ;

at a quarter of a metre 32 was brighter than either 30 or 31.

     With a tube 4 metres in length between the collimator and prism ray 32 is not
seen ; but when the tube is exhausted, ray 31 gains in intensity and 32 comes into

view, and gradually gets brighter than 31, whilst 30 changes very little during

the exhaustion. AVith the same tube he found no appreciable difference between

the absorption by air very carefully dried and by moist air, and concludes that this

absorption is not due to tlie \'apour of water, and it follows the law of pressure of

the atmosphere which shows it to be due to the whole mass or thickness of the air.
Also, M. iSoret has shown that water acts very differently ou the two ends of the

spectrum, distilled water being perfectly transparent for the most refrangible rays,

since a column of water of IIG cm. allowed the ray 2060 in the spectrum

of zinc to pass through : on the other hand, water is so opaque to the ultra-

red rays that a length of 1 cm. of it reduces the heat spectra of metals

to half their length and one quarter of their intensity.

    In concluding my address, I wish to draw attention to some of those magnetic

changes which are due to the action of the Sun, and which are probably brought

about by means of the ether which conveys to us his radiant heat and light.

In his discussion of the magnetic effects observed on the earth's surface. General

Sabine has shown the existence of diujnal variations due to the magnetic action of

the sun ; also the magnetic disturbances, aurora and earth currents, which are now
again beginning to be large and frequent, have been set down to disturbances in

the sun.

     Although iron, when raised to incandescence, has its power of attracting a
magnet very greatly diminished, we have no proof that it has absolutely no mag-

netic power left, and with a slight magnetic action the quantity of iron in the suu

would be sufficient to account for the diurnal variations of the magnetic needle.

During the last few weeks I have been engaged in examining the declination
curves for the month of March 1879, which have been kindly lent to the Ivew

Committee by the Directors of the Observatories of St. Petersburg, Vienna, Lisbon,

Coiuibra, and Stonyhurst. On comparing them with the Kew curves for the

the same period, I find the most remarkable coincidences between the curves

from these widely distant stations. It was previously known that there was a

similarity between disturbances at different stations, and in one or two cases a

comparison betv.-eeu Lisbon and Kew had been made many years ago by Sefior

Capcllo and Professor Balfour Stewart ; but the actual photogi-aphic magnetic

records from several stations have never been previously collected, and so the

opportunity for such comparisons had not arisen. Allow me to draw attention to

a few of the more prominent features of these comparisons which I ha^e made.

On placing the declination curves over one another, I find that in many cases there

is absolute agreement between them, so that the rate of change of magnetic

disturbances at widely distant stations like Kew, Vienna, and St. Petersburg is

precisely the  same                            also  similar  disturbances take place at different stations at the
                                            ;

same absolute time. It may be stated generally, for large as well as small disturlv

ances, that the east and west deflections of the declination needle take place at the
same time and are of the same character at these widely distant stations.

    There are exceptions to this law. Some disturbances occur at one or two stations
and are not perceived at another station. Many instances occur where, up to a
458 EEPOET-- 1880.

certain point of time, the disturbances at all the stations are precisely alike, but
suddenly at one or two stations the disturbance changes its character : for instance,

on comparing Kew and St. Petersburg, we get perfect similarity followed by de-

flections of the needle opposite ways at the same instant, and in some such cases
the maxima in opposite directions are reached at the same instant, showing that the
opposite deflections are produced by the same cause, and that the immediate cause
or medium of distiu-bance in such a case is not far olF; probably it is some change
of direction or intensity of the earth's magnetism arising from solar action upon it.

     Generally, after an hour or two, these differences in the effects of the disturbance
vanish, and the disturbances again become alike and simultaneous. In such cases
of difference, if the curve-tracing of the horizontal or the vertical force be examined,

it is generally found that, at the instant when these opposite movements begin there

is an increase or a diminution in the horizontal force, and that the horizontal force
continues to change as long as there is any difference in the character of the
declination curves. It is clear, then, from these effects that the cause or causes
of magnetic disturbances are in general far distant from the earth's surface, even

when those disturbances are large but that not unfrequently these causes act on
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

magnetic matter nearer to the surface of the earth, and therefore at times between
two places of observation, and nearer to one than another, thus producing opposite
effects on the declination needle at those places ; in such cases, the differences

are probably due to changes in the earth's magnetic force. Now, if we imagine

--the masses of iron, nickel, and magnesium in the sun to retain even a slight degree

of magnetic power in their gaseous state and we Iniow from the researches
of Faraday that gases, are some of them magnetic--we have a sufficient cause
for all our terrestrial magnetic changes, for we know that these masses of metal

are ever boiling up frour the lower and hotter levels of the sun's atmosphere to the
cooler upper regions, where tbey must again form clouds to throw out their light
and heat, and to absorb the light and lieat coming from the hotter lower regions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

then they become condensed and are drawn again back towards the body of the
sun, so forming those remarkable dark spaces or sun-spots by their downrush to-
wards the lower levels.

     In these vast changes, which we know from the science of energy must be
taking place, but of the vastness of which we can have no conception, we have
.abundant cause for those magnetic changes which we observe at the same instant

at distant points on the surface of the earth, and the same cause acting by induc-

tion on the magnetic matter within and on the earth may well produce changes in

the magnitude or in the direction of its total magnetic force. These magnetic
changes on the earth will influence the declination needles at different places, and
will cause them to be deflected ; the direction of the deflection must depend on
the situation of the earth's magnetic axis or the direction of its motion with regard
to the stations where the observations are made. Thus both directly and indi-

rectly we may find in the Sun not only the cause of diurnal magnetic variations,

but also the cause of these remarkable magnetic changes and disturbances over
the surface of the Earth.

3. On determining ilte Heights and Distances of Clvuds hy their reflexions in
   a luw pool of icater, and in a mercurial horir-on. Bij Francis Galton,

    M.A., F.B.S.

    The calm surface of a slieet of water may lie made to serve the purpose of a

huge mirror in a gigantic vertical range-finder, whereby a sufficiently large

parallax may he obtained for the efii?ctive measurement of clouds. The observation

of the heights and thicknesses of the different strata of clouds, and of their rates of
movement, is at the present time perhaps the most promising, as it is the least

explored branch of meteorology. As there are comparatively few places in
England where the two conditions are found of a pool of water well screened
from wind, and of a station situated many feet in height above it, the author hopes
by the publication of this memoir to induce some qualified persons who have
access to favourable stations, to interest themselves in the subject, and to make

observations.

     The necessary angles may be obtained with a sextant and mercurial horizon,

but it is convenient, for reasons shortlj' to be explained, to have in addition a

tripod stand, with a bar of wood across its top to support the mercurial trough,
and some simple instrument for the rapid and rough measurement of altitudes. I
have used the little pocket instrument sold by Casella, of ITolboru Bars, London,

called a ' pocket alt-azimuth,' and have employed Captain George's mercurial
horizon on account of its steadiness and ease in manipulation.

     The observer has to determine :
     1. The difference of level in feet between the mercury and the pool of water

(call it d).

     2. The angle between the reflexions of a part of a cloud in the mercury and in

the pool (call it ^7). This should be carefully measured.

     3. The angle between the portion of the cloud and its reflexion in the mercury

(call it 2 a). This may be roughly measured ; its altitude a may most conveniently
be taken at once by the pocket alt-azimuth or other instrument. The subjoined

tables will then give the required result with great ease.
     If ^j be not greater than .3°, and if n be the ntimber of minutes of a degree in ji,

the error occasioned by writing n sin 1' for sin n', will never exceed six inches iu a

thousand feet, and may be disregarded. Other errors of similar unimportance,
due to the eye not being close to the merctiry, may also be ignored. Under these
conditions, since log. sin. 1' = 6'4G373, it can be easily shown that

                          distance of cloud = - X 6875-5 cos (a + j>).

                          vertical height of cloud = distance x sin a.

     The following table has been calculated for these values when - = 1 . To use
                                                                                                  n

it, multiply the tabular numbers by d (the difference in feet between the level of
the mercury and that of the pool) and divide by n (the number of minutes of a
degree in the angle between the reflexion in the mercury and that in the pool).
The result will be the distance, or height, as required in feet.

stations exist whence mountain tarns can he seen Ij'ing at a much lower level
than this, and where even the higliest cirrus could be measured with satisfactory

precision.

     Useful regular work might he done by a meteorologist whose station was at a
height of even 50 feet above a pool, supposing it to be so well sheltered from the

wind as to frequently afford perfectly good reflexions with, say, 1' maximum error.
Very shallow water is much stiller than deep water, as waves cannot be propagated
over it ; thus we may often see wonderfully good reflexions in road-side splashes and

puddles, in the intervals between puffs of wind. The most stagnant air is in the
middle of a high and broad plantation, where there is also plenty of dense under-
wood. Detached puddles of water in broad ruts would be a good equivalent for
a pool. As regards the size of the pool, if we let fall a perpendicular k from the
mercury trough to the level of the water, the utmost portion of the surface of the
pool that canlje used with effect extends between the distances of about hk and
4k from the base of the perpendicular. The angles of depression would be then from
G4° to 14° about, or say, a range of 50°. The usual limits would be from k to 3^-,

or between 45° and 18°, being a range of 27°.

Improved Heliograph or Sun Signal. By Tempest Andersox, M.D., B.S.c

The author claims to have contrived a heliograph, or sun-telegraph, by which

the rays of the sun can be directed on any given point with greater ease and

certainty than by those at present in use.

When the sun's rays are .reflected at a small plane surface considered as a point,

the reflected rays form a cone, whose vertex is at the reflector and whose vertical

ano-le is equal to that subtended by the sun. Adding to the size of the mirror

adds other cones of light, whose bounding rays are parallel with those proceeding

from other points of the mirror, and only distant from them the same distance as

the points on the mirror from which they are reflected. Hence increasing the size

of the mirror only adds to the field to which the sun's rays are reflected a diameter

equal to the diameter of the mirror, and this at any distance at which the sun-

signal would be used is quite inappreciable. Adding to the size of the mirror adds

to the number of rays sent to each point, and hence to the brightness of the visible

flash, but not to the area over which it is visible.

By the author's plan, an ordinary field-glass is used to find the position of the

object to be signalled to, and to it is attached, in the position of the ordinary sun-

shade, a small and light apparatus, so arranged that when the mirror is turned to

direct the cone of rays to any object within the field of view of the glass, an image

of the sun appears in the field, at the same time as the image of the distant object,

and magnified to the same degree, and the part of the field covered by this image

is exactly that part to which the rays are reflected, and at which some part of the

sun's disc is visible in the mirror.

   A perfectly plane silvered mirror, A, takes up the rays of the sun, and when in

proper position reflects them parallel with the axis of D, which is one barrel of an

ordinary field-glass. The greater part of the liglit passes away to the distant

object, but some is taken up by the small silvered mirror E, which is placed at an

ano-le of 45° to the axis of D, and reflected at a right angle through the unsilvered

plane mirror, F, and the convex lens, K, by which it is brought to a focus on the

white screen, H, which is placed in the principal focus of K. The rays from this

Kima^e diverge in all directions, and some are taken up by the lens and restored

to parallelism ; some of these are reflected by the unsilvered mirror, F, down to the

field-o-lass, D, and if this is focussed for parallel rays, as is the case in looking at

distant objects, an image of the sun is seen projected on the same field of view as

E Fthat of the distant object. As the mirrors and     are adjusted strictly parallel,

AFthe rays proceeding from
into the field-glass are parallel and in the opposite

direction to those going from the mirror to E, which form part of the same

pencil as those going to the distant object. Hence the image of the sun seen in

the field exactly covers the object to which the sun-flash is visible, and in whatever
462  EEPORT 1 880.

Adirection the mirror is moved so as to alter the direction in which rays are

Ereflected to the distant object, and the angle at which part impinge on and are

reflected through the lens K, the image visible in tue glass moves in the same
direction. Several attempts to produce this result were made bv the use of mirrors

Kand pi'isms, before the lens was introduced, but they all failed. It was easy to

make the image of the sun cover the object when the two occupied the centre of
the field of view, but directly the mirror wa? inclined so as to direct the rays not

strictly parallel to the axis of the field-glass, the apparent image diverged generally

in the same direction along one co-ordinate, and in the opposite along one at right

angles to it, so that nowhere, but in one line across the field, did the image lie in

E Fthe desired position. The mirrors and are adjusted parallel once for all, by

noticing the position on a screen of the small spot of light reflected from the front

of F as the light passes from E to K. The mirrors are moved by the adjusting-

screws till this spot has, to the bright reflection from the mirror A, the same

Frelative position that the centre of mirror has to the mirror A.

      In actual use the field-glass is first fixed in position pointing to the object,

either by holding steadily in the hand, or better by a clamp attached, by which it
can be screwed into a tree or post, or fixed in the muzzle of a rifle. The instru-

ment is turned on the barrel of the glass till the sun is in the plane passing through

Athe two axes of the instrument, and the mirror is turned till the bright image of

the sun is seen on the screen II, through a hole left for the purpose in the side of

the tube. On looking through the glass the sun's image is seen, and by then slightly
rotating the instrument or moving the mirror, is made to cover the object. The

Amirror is connected not directly to the body of the instrument, but to a lever B,

on which it works stiflly, so as to retain any position in which it is placed. Lever

B works easily and has a limited range of motion, to one end of which it is pressed

by a spring ; slight pressure with the finger moves it and its attached mirror, so as
to throw the liglit on and off" the object in a succession of long and short flashes
by which letters and words may be indicated.

     Mr. F. Galton said that the steadiness of aim required would be so great that
it would be impossible with the instrument exhibited to gi^'e signals with precision
without using a stand. lie proposed that a convex or concave lens, of about 30
feet focus, should be attached near E, in the path of the rays from the mirror to
the distant object, so as to disperse them over a field about three times the apparent
diameter of the sun. This would render free-handed signalling practicable, though
it would diminish the brightness of the flashes, and the instrument without the

lens could be used to attract attention.

     The above instrument answers well for all positions of the sun except when
very low bihind the observer's back. For this case another mirror is provided by
which the light is reflected on to the mirror A.

      5. Improved Apparatus for the Objective Estimation of Astigmatism.
                             Bij Tempest Andeeson, M.I)., B.Sc.

     Astigmatism lias been defined as that condition of tlie eye in which refraction
is unequal in the different meridians. In order to obtain suitable spectacles for
corrcL-tiug: this defect, it is necessary to huow accurately the focal adjustment of

the meridians of maximum and minimum curvature, whence the focal lengths of

glasses, generally either cylindrical or cylindrical on one side and spherical on the

other, are readily calculated. Many plans have been adopted for determining this
some subjective, depending on observations made by the eye itself, and generally
using a point of light or a series of radiating lines as an object. From their

appearances -when viewed at different distances, and with lenses of different powers,
the focal adjustment of the different meridians is at last obtained.

     The advantage of this group of methods is their theoretical delicac}-, as they
work by judging of the perfection of certain images refracted on the retina in a
manner not very dissimilar to that in which they are usually formed ; the jn-ac-
tical disadvantage, that accurate observations are required from one who has never
been accustomed to make them. Hence objective methods have been introduced.

Their advantages are, substituting trained for untrained observation. Their

--disadvantages (1) The vessels of the retina and the optic nerves, which are

mostly employed as objects, are seldom iu exactly the position desirable for
estimating the refraction in different meridians, and are often at a diflerent distance
from the optical system of the eye from that at which the sensitive layer of the

retina lies.

     (2) They mostly require the optical defects, if any, and the accouimodatiou of
the observing eye to be taken into account and allowed for, thus introducing risk

of error.

     In the author's two instruments, an image of a suitable object thrown on the

--retina of the observed eye, is used as an object b}- the observer, with the following

advantages :
464 REPORT-- 1880.

(1) The patient's sensations may be entirely disregarded, or only used as con-

firmatory.

(2) The image used is necessarily at the retina, and not before or behind it.
(3) The accommodation, or any defects in the refraction of the observer's eye,

does not enter into the result, as the only function of this eye is to observe the
formation of the image on the retina.

     In the first plan a lamp I is provided with a condensing lens c, and a series
of radiating wires iv (supposed to be seen edgeways in the figure), thus giving a
bright field with black lines on it.

     The whole slides on a graduated bar, C, at the other end of which is a convex
lens,?/ [4 and 10 dioptrics are the most convenient powers, i.e. 10 and 4 inch focus].

Close to the lens, and at an angle of 4;5° to its axis, is a plane mirror (»»), wliich
reflects the rays at riijht angles to their former path. The instrument is to be

held so that this pencil of rays enters the observed eye, and when the wire screen

is at the proper distance, an image of it is formed on the retina. The mirror has

the centre left unsilvered, as in an ordinary ophthalmoscope, and has a disc of

correcting lenses behind it, to render the retina, and the image on it, visible by the
direct method. The observed eye should have its accommodation relaxed by

atropine.

The bar is so divided that when an image of the whole or part of the screen

is sharp on the retina, the graduation expresses the refractive error of the corre-

sponding meridian. Hence, if the image of the whole screen is seen to be equally

sharp, the eye is known to be not astigmatic, and the graduation gives the number

of dioptrics by which it is myopic or hypermetropic. If the lines be not aU

equally sharp, then the most distant point at which a distinct image of any

of the wires is formed on the retina gi\"es the refractive error of the meridian

of minimum refraction expressed in dioptrics, and the point at which the line
at right angles to this is best defined, gives that of the meridian of maximum

refraction. The least of these gives the spherical element of the correcting lens

required for distant objects, and the difference between the two gives that of the

cylindiical part. The meridian of maximum refraction is that in which the line is
visible when the wires are at the greatest distance.

In the second plan the lamp, /, condensing lens, c, and wire screen, w, are

similar, and only differ in size, the front lens, y, and mirror, in, are also similar,
but the lamp and wires are permanently fixed by a tube, so that the wires are

accurately in the principal focus of the front lens, y. By this means the rays

from the wires (or rather from the interval between them), after refraction through

the lens and reflection by the mirror, are parallel. If received by an eye which is

emmetropic, and witli its accommodation relaxed, an image of the wires is formed
on the retina. The light radiating from this image passes out through the optical

system of the eye ; is rendered parallel and able to form an accurate image on the

retina of an emmetropic eye observing through the hole in the mirror.

If the observed eye be not emmetropic, it is only necessary to introduce lenses

of different powers close in front of it, so as to correct the rays both entering and

leaving the eye. If the refraction be the same in all meridians, the image of all

the wires is sharp with the same lens, and this lens is the one required to correct

the ametropia. If any astigmatism exists, different lenses are required for render-

ing the images of the diflferent wires sharp.

The strongest and weakest of these are the measures of the errors of refraction

of the two principal meridians, and the diff'erence of their numbers of dioptrics

gives the cylindrical element of the correcting glass required.

In this form of apparatus a disc of correcting lenses behind the mirror is not

required, as the single correcting lens near the observed eye corrects the rays both,

entering and leaving the ej'e.

For rapidly finding the proper lens a disc of lenses is used, each a centimetre

in diameter, and with intervals of one dioptric                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a smaller disc is attached contain-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

ing the quarter dioptrics, so that by their combination intervals of one quarter of a

--dioptric can be read a degree of accuracy greater than the estimation is generally

susceptible of.

The proper lens being calculated, its spherical and cylindrical elements are

combined and put together before the eye. If it be the correct one, all the lines

are seen sharp at the same time. If not, further examination is made.
     The principal advantage of the first plan is that the adjustment, being made by

the motion of the wire screen, is continuous, and correcting lenses are not required

for measuring the refraction, but only for rendering the retinal image  visible                            its
                                                                                                        ;

disadvantage that, as the rays are not parallel as they pass from the front lens,

past the mirror to the eye, it is necessary for the apparatus to be very near, and at

a determinate distance from the observed eye, otherwise the readings of the scale

are vitiated. This, however, is not a serious objection.
     In the second plan the rays in the corresponding position are parallel, and the

instrument can be held at any convenient distance, say 1 or 2 feet from the

observed eye, and the observer can get a view of the cornea at the same time as he

views the image, so that he can estimate the refraction at diiferent points of the

the cornea.

It is hoped that this may eventually lead to the determination of the refraction

at different parts of conical cornea and other eyes with irregular astigmatism,

and the application of suitable lenses to them.

     Since writing the above, I find mention of an in.strument hy Coccius Stimmel,

with an optical arrangement on the same plan as my second, but I have not heard
of its being in use in this country. The makers are T. Cooke & Sons, York.

  6. On the Length of the Sun-spot Period.^ By Henkt Mdirhead, M.D.

    It is well known to all who take an interest in the phenomena of sun-spots that
men of science are far from being agreed as to the length of the period intervening
between one maximum epoch and another. I should think, however, that those
who wish to prove that our rain, our storms, terrestrial magnetism, harvests of
grain and vintage, with commercial crises, &c., depend a good deal on how the face
of the sun is covered, should first of all make sure of the real length of the sxm-

spot period. To help towards its fixation I beg to bring under the notice of the
Section the following table arranged from Wolf's latest corrected relative sun-spot
numbers, from 1770 till 1877, with accompanying tracing. The numbers are ar-
ranged to correspond with Jupiter's period of "11-863 years. Each vertical column

(save one) commences with the year in which Jupiter's heliocentric longitude is
263|°. The last column is the summation. The dates of the cycles were
chosen on the supposition that much of the sun's radiance arises from matter im-

-- --pinging on his atmosphere ^just as so-called star-showers light up ours and that

when Jupiter is in or near the front of the sun's march in space {i.e. hel. long. 263|°)
he intercepts a good deal of the meteoric aggregations which would otherwise im-

Wepinge against the sun's envelopes, giving rise to sun-spots till sublimated.

know that comets whose aphelia are about as distant as Jupiter's orbit have periods
of about five years ; so meteoric matter may be supposed to take about two and a

half years to come from Jupiter to the sun. Now please observe that the average

minimum sun-spot epoch occurs about two and a half years after Jupiter is at
R.A. 263|°, and the maximum about six years after the minimum, that is, when
we might expect Jupiter's intercepting influence to be least. But leaving out of

-- --account this hypothesis, the fact remains as the table and tracings^ show that

the sun-spot period is not 10 years, nor 11, nor 11-1, but seemingly 11-863, con-e-
sponding with Jupiter's period. It is to this conclusion that I wish to call the

attention of meteorologists and others, who vnsh. to show a coi-respondence

between their various periodicities and those of sun-spots. In 1875 I brought
this before the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, and also produced evidence to

an armature is to be employed.

     Since that time some thousands of that form of magnet have been made for
medical, mining, and other purposes.

     Some months ago, when in conversation with M. Breguet of Paris, I showed
him these same diagrams, and he was very much impressed with their importance.
lie has since then constructed a machine, using the Gramme armature ; and with a
smaller quantity of steel in the magnets he has made a far more powerful machine
than hitherto constructed with either the Jamin or the ordinary horse-shoe form.
It is also more symmetrical in appearance and occupies less space.

     With this machine I can heat to incandescence 19 inches of platinum wire
by four turns of the handle ; while to heat 14 inches of the same sized wire by a
machine having a Jamin magnet took ten turns of the handle.

              5. An Account of some ^Experiments in Photo-electricity.
                                  By G. M. MiNCHiN, M.A.

The two objects aimed at primarily in photo-electricity are

          (rt) the production, at a distance, of effects due, in the first instance, to the

              photographic action of light

          (b) the continuous daily registration of the intensity of sunlight of any

              selected wave-length.

The first of these is the problem of constructing what the author has called

the I'eleiyhotograjih, and some of the fundamental conditions of success have been

attained.

     The second problem will, in all probabiUty, soon attain a satisfactory solution,
much progress having been already made towards it.

     The author investigated, in the first instance, the photo-electric currents pro-

duced by the action of light on silver plates, coated with the ordinary emulsions

--of silver salts in use among photographers viz., the chloride, bromide, and iodide

of silver.

     In a cell containing tap water (or slightly acidulated water, or distilled water

with a few grains of common salt), if a chloride plate is immersed in presence of

an uncoated plate, the current runs from the latter to the former in the cell.
     The same is the direction of the current when the chloride is replaced by a

bromide plate.

But if the sensitised plate is an iodide plate (the conducting liquid being dis-

tilled water with a few grains of iodide of potassium), the direction of the current

is reversed.

In carrying out an idea about phosphorescence as a photo-electric source, it

appeared to be of importance to study sulphide of silver. If any emulsion of this
salt is made with collodion, and a silver-plate sensitised with it be immersed, as

above, in a glass cell, the direction of the cm-rent given by magnesium light (or

simlight), agrees with that of the iodide plate ; and by passing the light incident
on the plate through coloured glasses, it will be found that the red and the blue

rays give strong results in the same direction, while the green light gives a com-

paratively trifling action. For this salt there is therefore a point of minimum

Asensibility in the middle of the spectrum.  silver plate coated with nitrate of

silver (shaken up in a test-tube with thin photographic gelatine), gave with blue

rays a strong current in the iodide and sulphide direction and with red rays a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

very small result in the opposite direction, though whether this latter result is due

to the action of the red rays on the emulsion or on the plate itself is not

certain.

It was found in several of these experiments that the observation of Grove to

the effect that light sets up a current in the direction of some previously existing

current, being incapable of setting up one of its own, was not confirmed. The
experiments of Grove which gave rise to this statement are referred to. From

«ven a pm-ely logical consideration we miglit conclude that his statement cannot

be accepted.

     The photographic effect of a current which is passed through a sensitised

plate is a point ot fundamental importance. By placing two plates, each coated

with Liverpool Emulsion, in a cell containing distilled water and a few grains of

bromide of potassium, and putting this cell into the circuit of a bichromate cell

for a few seconds, it will be found that

(a) the plate connected with the carbon pole is, without the employment of a

             developer, visibly blackened in its immersed portion ;

(6) no visible change comes on the other plate ; but when this plate is developed
           by pyrogallic acid, its immersed portion also becomes dark.

This fundamental result was also obtained (though in a less marked degree) by

the action of a photo-electric cell, instead of the bichromate cell. To produce the

effect with greater ease in this case, expose the two bromide plates to gas-light for

about ten seconds before immersion. The localisation of the effect on the plate

through which the current passed was further shown by placing several silver

strips on the same plate of glass, coating all of them with a layer of Liverpool

Emulsion, and throwing some of them out of the circuit of the current. Only

those in circuit exhibit the photographic effect. Assuming that fluorescence ought

to operate a change of luminous energy into that of an electric current, the

author next replaced the silver salts by fluorescent siibstances. Eosine gave the
Abest results, but it is very easily soluble and it leaves the plate rapidly.
                                                                                                                                   very

permanent eosine plate was obtained by making a mixture of eosine solution and

thin gelatine, pouring this over the plate, and then pouring a layer of collodion
over it. This was exceedingly sensitive to even dull sunlight, and when connected

with a galvanometer, indicated the faintest change in the light which it received.

As a perfect photometer it has a drawback. When the light is suddenly shut off,

the spot on the scale does not immediately return to zero. It was found that this

irregularity was due (partly at least) to the action of light on coUodion, and this

Alatter was specially examined.  less sensitive, but more regular, plate was made

by mixing eosine with thin gelatine and rendering the layer insoluble by immersion

in alum solution.

Naphthalene red gives also very good results, and comes near satisfpngthe

requirements of a perfect photometer for continuous registration. Strong light

--gives opposite results by the action of red and blue rays. Iodine-green an

anihne dye gives very strong currents, in the direction opposed to that of the

-- --current given by an emulsion of iodide of silver a result for which a theoretical

reason may be given.

The E.M.F. of this cell for strong but oblique sunlight was in one experiment

found to rise so high as ~th of a Daniell.

--To prevent the solubility of several of the substances employed, mordants
such as chloride of aluminium and borax     were    employed                                   but though the layers

on the plates were rendered insoluble, then- sensitiveness to light was almost

by a plate coated with eosine and immersed in water. This was a small jerky

current, lasting for a second or so, and it was immediately succeeded by a large

current in the opposite direction which varied with the light intensity. When

the light was suddenly shut ofl" a further jerk in the latter direction took place,

and then the spot moved towards its zero position. The two plates having been

was kept up, the spot stead'ily came back and moved in its normal direction beyond

& distance of three or four inches. These contrary currents appear to the author

to point to a mechanical action of light on the eosme in solution, as distinct from

with it. The immersed plates become each coated with a layer of a darkish appear-
ance (eoside of silver ?), and this layer will give a current in the same direction as

that given by a silver plate coated in the old way with any emulsion of eosine.
     Platinum plates always give in these experiments much smaller resvdts than

silver plates ; hut this fact may he due to the circumstance that, vrith the substances
employed, silver may be a better vehicle for the transference of the energy than

--platinum apart from the consideration of chemical action.

      Several other substances, such as fluorescine, fuchsine, sidphate of quinine, &c.
were used, the results being less marked.

     Phosphorescence was studied by coating a platinum plate with a mixture of
gelatine and sulphide of calcium, and currents were produced by the action of
magnesium light.

      Experiments of the class last referred to are in progress.

6. Electric Govvection-Currenfs. Bi/ Silvanus P. Thompson, D.Sc, B.A.^
         Professor of Experimental Physics in University College, Bristol.

     In a paper ' On the Action of Magnets on Mobile Conductors of Currents,' read
before this Section a year ago, the author discussed a number of cases of the flow

of electricity across a magnetic field. These included cases of true metallic con-
duction, of electrolj'tic conduction, and of those less-understood kinds of conduc-
tivity which occur in the voltaic arc, in the discharges in rarefied media, and in
the luminous brush-charge at a point. For the case of convection of electricity,
either automatically, by self-repidsion between electiified particles of a gas, or
mechanically, the electro-magnetic efiect is identical with that of a current in
which the same quantity of electricity would be transferred in the same time ; the

' rate of convection ' -^ being in these cases the equivalent of ' the strength of the

current.'

      Maxwell's theory (vol. ii. art. 768) concerning the virtual identity of a current

msheet and of an electrified sheet mo^·ing its own plane -tt-ith a velocity equal to

* v,' may be extended to the case of linear currents. The identity may be

generahsed to all cases of convection-currents.
      Last year the author predicted that the brush discharge at a point would

experience a spiral twist when takmg place in the magnetic field. He has since

found this to be experimentally the case.
     The author also pointed out the similarity between the magnetic distortion

found by Reitlinger and Wachter ia electric ring-figures, and that found by himself

to be produced by the presence of a magnet on Nobili's figures. He also referi-ed to

Maxwell's theory as explaining some of the phenomena observed in the exhausted
 tubes of Mr. Crookes, in which the discharges from the negative electrode behave
like convection-currents having a velocity less than the velocity of light.

    7. On a peculiar behaviour of Copper. By "William Henet Preece.

     From some experiments made in Dr. Warren De La Rue's laboratory it appeared

that in some cases copper wires did not acquire their normal resistance imtU currents
of electricitj' had passed through them. In several instances the resistance of
virgin copper was far higher than it was after electricity had passed through.

8. On the proper form of Lightning Conductors. By William Heney Peeece.

     The question of the relative value of surface and sectional area in lightning-
conductors never ha\'ing been satisfactoiily solved experimentally, the authoi", with

the aid of Dr. De La Rue's gigantic battery, endeavomred to do so. He obtained

wire tubes and ribbons of copper and lead of similar lengths and weight, and

passed very powerful charges of electricity through them, observing their thermic
eifects upon platmum and silver wires. It was found that change of form pro-
duced no difference whatever in the character of the discharge, and it was proved

that the discharges of electricity of high potential obey the laws of Ohm. No

more efficient lightning conductor can be devised than a cylindrical rod or a wire

rope.

9. On the necessitij for a regular Inspection of Lightning Conductors.

                   Bij Richard Anderson, F.G.S., A.Inst.G.E.

    The author referred to a paper by M. W. de Fonvielle, ' On the advantage of

keeping records of Physical Phenomena connected with Thunderstorms,' read
before this Association in 1872. M. de Fonvielle recommended to the attention of
the members the steps which had been taken by the French Government for
obtaining information regarding thunderstorms, and suggested that the Association
should institute some organisation for the collection of such data; arguing that it
would be of much value to science, as well as to the public. Nothing, however,
has been done by the Association since 1872 ; and the author not only confirmed
the conclusions at which M. de Fonvielle arrived as to the desirability of collecting
such data, but was of opinion that the organisation should go further, and arrange
for a regular inspection of all public buildings which had lightning-conductors

applied.

The necessity for this he demonstrated by adducing a number of striking cases

where damage, more or less severe, had occurred to buildings, even though having

lightning conductors attached to them. The cases now cited, he explained, were

supplementary to those communicated in his paper on a similar subject to the

AAssociation in 1878.   few of the cases were as follows :

In October, 1878, an elevated building situated at the back of Victoria Station,

occupied as a furniture repository, was struck by lightning and sustained damage,

although furnished with a f-inch by ^-inch copper-band lightning conductor and

a tube of |-inch diameter rising above the iron crestings on tower. The lightning

shattered the cresting and bent the point of the lightning-rod, besides doing other

damage to the building. On testing, the author found the resistance very great,

and on opening out the earth-terminal found it embedded in concrete.
    In June last St. Mark's Church, Skelton, was struck by lightning, when the

air-terminal of a f-nich diameter copper-rope conductor was slightly bent. On

testing, the author found the resistance great, and on opening the ground, the

conductor was found to be carried from the building about 14 feet and bxiried

among brick and stone rubbish. The conductivity of the copper was 52 50 instead

of 92 to 94 per cent.

On June 26 last lightning struck All Saints' Church, Lambeth, doing con-

siderable damage, although there was a f-inch diameter copper-rope conductor on

Athe west gable, with a copper tube rising 18 inches above.  stone cross about 50

feet from the conductor was thrown down, injuring the roof of the north aisle.

On testing the conductor, the author found that it had no ' earth ' whatever, the

rope being simply placed in 2 inches of loose rubbish. The copper was of very

inferior quality; conductivity being 32'10 per cent., or about double that of iron.

The author quoted also a few cases fi-om his recent work on ' Lightning Con-

ductors, their History, &c.' :

     In August, 1878, the Powder Magazine at Victoria ColHery, Burntcliffe, York-
shire, was struck by lightning, though furnished with a conductor 13 feet above
the building and terminating in 13 feet of clayey soil. The building was blown to
pieces. On testing the conductivity of the copper it was found to be 39'2, instead
of 92 to 94 per cent. The conductor was insulated from the building and from a
large iron door, which it ought not to have been.

     The author concludes from this evidence that it is not sufficient merely that

rods of copper should be attached to a building, but it is necessary that after being
fixed they should be regularly inspected, to see if they are in good order, so as to

be really efficacious.

10. Nute on the Theory of the Induction Balance. By Lord Rayleigh,

 F.It.8., Professor of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge.

     This subject lias been treated by Dr. Lodge in the ' PMl. Mag.' for February,

1880, who has arrived at several interesting results. The investigation may be

considerably simplified by taking the case of pure tones, as is usual in acoustics.

We may also suppose, for distinctness of conception, that the current in the primary

circuit (.I'j) is sensibly unaffected by the reaction of derived currents, though our

results will be independent of this hypothesis.

     If .f] .r^ .... be the currents, JR^Bo . . the resistances, ilfj, ilf^, ^12
the coefficients of self-induction, and of mutual induction, the equations for three

circuits are

                      ^M,, + M^. -^ + JR^T^ = - i»fi2^
                      ^- dt         ^^ dt              *^        '^ dt

We now assume that .i-j .v^ .... are proportional to e"", where WH-27r is the

frequency of vibration. Thus :

                      = ~ TM+ ^23 + ^2in (Mr,2 .1'o              -^12 ·''1

                      -in (.¥,,3 .r,, + M^^.v^) + =i?, .r^       in M,^ .v^

whence by elimination of .v^

                      m^- ^     .W33 + -R3 i                                      m M^^ + R^

From tliis it appears that a want of balance depending on M^^ cannot compen-

sate for the action of the tertiary circuit, so as to produce silence in the secondary

(telephone) circuit, unless J?, be negligible in comparison with w ilf33, that is unless

the time-constant of the tertiary circuit be very great in comparison with the period

of the vibration. Otherwise the effects are of different phases, and therefore in-

capable of balancing.

   We will now introduce a fourth circuit, and suppose that the primary and

secondary circuits are accurately conjugate, so that 3/jj = 0, and also that the

mutual induction between the third and fourth circuits {M^^ may be neglected.

Thus

                      in {M22 ,r,, + M,,^ .r^ + M^^ .v^) + R^ .v,, =

                                                                 "'" -"^ii

Two conditions must be satisfied to secure a balance, since both the phases and

the intensities of the separate effects must be the same. The first condition

requires that the time-constants of the third and fourth circuits be equal, unless

both be either very great or very small in comparison with the period. If this

condition be satisfied, a balance may be obtained by shifting the circuits so as to

bring M^^ M^^ into equality with M^, M^^.

In the case of a shilling the time-constant can scarcely be so high as a ten-

thousandth of a second, but periods smaller than this may be concerned when a

microphone clock is employed.

For similar discs or coins the time-constant varies as a^ r~ *, a being the linear

dimension and /· the specific resistance. Equal coins cannot in general be balanced

if the specific resistances are difierent. To obtain a balance, a~ should vary as r.

on the supposition that the positions of the coins relatively to the primary and
secondary coils are the same.

   A perfect balance is not to be expected in general without two adjustments,

though in some cases a fair approximation may be obtained with the sliding

wedge employed by Hughes.

      If the condition of equality of time-constants be satisfied, the remaining condition

is independent of the value of n, so that a perfect balance for one pitch secures a

perfect balance for all pitches. From this it follows that the results are not
limited to simple tones, and that the two conditions are sufficient to secure a

balance in all cases. It should be remembered, however, that this indifference to

pitch does not apply to approximate balances, which may be satisfactory with one
sound, but quite inadequate when another is substituted.

   AI. finite volume of incompressible inviscid fluid being given, in motion, filling

a fixed, simply continuous, rigid boundary, the fact of its being in motion implies

molecular rotation, or (as it may be called for brevity) vorticity. Helmholtz's
law of conservation of vorticity shows that, whether the boundary be kept fixed as
given, or be moved or deformed in any way, and brought back to its given shape
and position, there remains in every portion of the fluid which had molecular

lotation a definite constant of vorticity ; and his formula for calculating energy for

any given distribution of vorticity allows us to see that the energy may be varied

fcy the supposed operation on the boundary.

--474 BEPOET 1880.

II. The condition for steady motion of an incompressible inviscid fluid filling a

finite fixed portion of space (that is to say, motion in which the velocity and direc-

tion of motion continue imchanged at every point of the space within which the

fluid is placed) is that, with given vorticity, the energy is a thorough maximum,

or a thorough minimum, or a minimax. The farther condition of stability is secured

by the consideration of energy alone for any case of steady motion, for which the

energy is a thorough maximum or a thorough  minimum                                          because  when the boun-
                                                                                          ;

dary is held fixed the energy is of necessity constant. But the mere consideration

of energy does not decide the question of stability for any case of steady motion in

which the energy is a minimax.

III. It is clear that, commencing with any given motion, the energy may be

increased indefinitely by properly-designed operation on the boundary (understood

that the primitive boundary is returned to). Hence, with given vorticity, there is

mno thorough maximum of energy any case. There may also be co7nplete annid-

ment of the energy by operation on the boundary (with return to the primitive

boundary), as we see by the following illustrations :

1. The case of two equal, parallel, and oppositely rotating vortex columns

terminated perpendicularly by two fixed parallel planes, which, by proper operation

on the boundary, may be so mixed (like two eggs ' whipped ' together) that, in-

finitely near to any portion of either, there shall be some of the other.

2. The case of a single Helmholtz ring, reduced by diminution of its aperture to

an infinitely long tube coiled within the enclosure.

3. The case of a single vortex column, with two ends on the boundary, bent

till its middle meets the boundary ; and farther bent and extended, till it is broken

into two equal and opposite vortex columns ; and then farther dealt with till these

two are whipped together to mutual annihilation.

IV. To avoid for the present the extremely difficult general question illustrated

(or suggested) by the consideration of such cases, confine ourselves now to two-

dimensional motions in a space bounded by two fixed parallel planes and a closed

cylindric surface perpendicular to them, subjected to changes of figure (but always

truly cylindric and perpendicular to the planes). It is obvious that, with the

limitation to two-dimensional motion, the energy cannot be either infinitely small

or infinitely great with any given vorticity and given cylindric figure. Hence,

under the given conditions, there certainly are at least two stable steady motions.

Wo shall, however, see farther (XI. below) that possibly in every case, except cases

of a narrow, well-defined character, and certainly in many cases, there is an infinite

number of stable steady motions.

     V. In the present case, clearly, though there are an infinite number of unstable

--steady motions, there are only two stable steady motions those of absolute maxi-

mum and of absolute minimum energy.

VI. In every steady motion, when the boundary is circular, the stream lines

are concentric circles, and the fluid is distributed in co-axial cylindric layers

of equal vorticity. In the stable motion of maximum energy, the vorticity is

greatest at the axis of the cylinder, and is less and less outwards to the circumfer-

ence. In the stable motion of minimum energy the vorticity is smallest at the

axis, and greater and greater outwards to the circumference. To express the con-

Tditions symboUcally, let be the velocity of the fluid at distance r from the axis

(understood that the direction of the motion is perpendicular to the direction of r) f
the vorticity at distance r is

                          (f-ff>

If the value of this expression diminishes from >· = to r = a, the motion is stable,
and of maximum energy. If it increases from ?· = to r = « the motion is stable
and of minimum energy. If it increases and diminishes, or diminishes and in-

creases, as r increases continuously, the motion is unstable.

     Vll. As a simplest subcase, let the vorticity be uniform through a given por-
tion of the whole fluid, and zero through the remainder. In the stable motion of

greatest energy, the portion of fluid having vorticity will be in the shape of a cii'cular
                                              ;

            TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.               475

cylinder rotating like a solid round its own axis, coinciding with the axi^ of the

enclosure ; and the remainder of the fluid will revolve irrotationally around it, so
as to fulfil the condition of no finite slip at the cylindrical interface hetween the
rotational and irrotational portions of the fluid. The expression for this motion in

symbols is

            T = Cr from »· = to r = 6

            --and T = ^ from r = 6 to r = «.

                              r

    VIII. In the stable motion of minimum energy the rotational portion of the
fluid is in the shape of a cylindric shell, inclosing the irrotational remainder, which
in this case is at rest. The symbolical expression for this motion is

            <^T = 0, when r  '^^),T- -=(«- 6'-) and
                                           C (^r

            > ^when r        --{cc^  b"),

    IX. Let now the liquid be given in the configuration VII. of greatest energy, and

let the cylindrical boundary be a sheet of a real elastic solid, such as sheet-metal
with the kind of dereliction from perfectness of elasticity which real elastic solids
present ; that is to say, let its shape when at rest be a function of the stress applied

to it, but let there be a resistance to change of shape depending on the velocity of

the change. Let the unstressed shape be truly circular, and let it be capable of

slight deformations from the circular figure in cross section, but let it always re-

main truly cylindrical. Let now the cylindric boundary be slighly deformed and

left to itself, and lield so as to prevent it from being carried round by the fluid.
The central vortex column is set into vibration in such a manner that longer and
shorter waves travel round it with less and greater angular velocity.* These waves
cause corresponding waves of corrugation to travel round the cylindric bounding

sheet, by which energy is consumed, and moment of momentum taken out of the
fluid. Let this process go on until a certain quantity of moment of momentmn has
been stopped from the fluid, and now let the canister run round freely in space, and,
for simplicity, suppose its material to be devoid of inertia. The whole moment of

momentum is initiallv

It is now

and continues constantly of this amount as long as the boundary is left free in space.
The consumption of energy still goes on, and the way in which it goes on is this:
the waves of shorter length are indefinitely multiplied and exalted till their crests
run out into fine laminae of liquid, and those of greater length are abated. Thus a
certain portion of the irrotationally revolving water becomes mingled with the cen-

tral vortex column. The process goes on until what may be called a vortex sponge

is formed ; a mixture homogeneous on a large scale, but consisting of portions of
rotational and irrotational fluid, more and more finely mixed together as time ad-
vances. The mixture is, as indicated above, altogether analogous to the mixture of
the substances of two eggs whipped together in the weU-known culinary operation.
Let b' be the radius of the cylindric vortex sponge, b being as before the radius of

the original vortex column

      X. Once more, hold the cylindric case from going round in space, and continue

holding it until some more moment of momentum is stopped from the fluid. Then
leave it to itself agam. The vortex sponge will swell by the mingling with it of an

additional portion of irrotational liquid. Continue this process vmtil the sponge
occupies the whole enclosure.

476  REPORT 1880.

     After that continue the process further, and the result will be that each time the
containing canister is allowed to go round freely in space, the fluid will tend to a
condition in which a certain portion of the original vortex core gets filtered into a
position next to the boundary, and the fluid within it tends to a more and more
nearly uniform mixture of vortex with irrotational fluid. This central vortex-sponge,

on repetition of the process of preventing the canister from going roimd, and again
leaving it free to go round, becomes more and more nearly irrotational fluid, and the
outer belt of pure vortex becomes thicker and thicker. The final condition towards

which the whole tends is a belt constituted of the original vortex core now next the
boundary ; and the fluid which originally revolved irrotationally round it now

placed at rest within it, being the condition (VIII, above) of absolute mmimum

energy. Begin once more with the condition (VII. above) of absolute maximum
energy, and leave the fluid to itself, whether mth the canister free to go round

sometimes, or always held fixed, provided only it is ultimately held from going

round in space ; the ultimate condition is always the same, viz., the condition (VIII.)

of absolute minimum energy.
    XI. That there may be an infinite number of configurations of stable motions,

each of them having the energy of a thorough minimum as said in IV. above, we

see, by considering the case in which the cylindric boundary of the containing can-
ister consists of two wide portions communicating by a narrow passage, as shown in
the sketch. If such a canister be completely filled with irrotationally moving fluid
of uniform vorticity, the stream luies must be something like those indicated in the

sketch.

     Hence if a small portion of the whole fluid is irrotational, it is clear that there

may be a minimum energy, and therefore a stable configuration of motion, with the

whole of this in one of the wide parts of the canister ; or the whole in the other
or any proportion in one and the rest in the other ; or a small portion in the elliptic
whirl in the connecting canal, and the rest divided in any proportion between the
two wide parts of the canister.

. Notes on Non-Euclidian Geometry. By Robert S. Ball, LL.D., F.B.S.

     The problem I propose to consider relates to the kinematics of a rigid body in
non-Euclidian space. I can hardly say that the commimication is exactly novel, as
                                                            ;

         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                               477

the same problem lias been considered by Lindemann. I think, however, that a
purely geometrical method of lookuig at the question ma}' he of interest.

The most general displacement of a rigid body is a rotation about an axis

combined with a rotation about the polar axis with regard to the absolute. These

Mytwo rotations form the unit of displacement.  problem is the determination of

the single imit of displacement, which is equivalent to the joint effect of two

displacements, all being small. This, it will be observed, includes every problem

of the composition of forces or rotations in non-EucUdian space.

Each of the component imits involves a pair of conjugate polars, A,A' and B,B',

and we require to find a pair of conjugate polars C,C' the rotations around which

shall be equivalent to the given rotations about A,A' and B,B'.

   XDraw the common transversals and X' to the four rays A,B,A',B', then it

can easily be shown that the effect of the given displacements on four points

Q R XP S on will move those points on right of Imes directed towards P' Q''
Q RR' S' on X', so that the anharmonic ratio of P
                                                   S is equal to that of P' Q'

R'S'.

   X LOn there are two critical points, and M, which are characterised by the

circumstance that they start in the same direction whether the displacement be

LA, A' or B, B'. It is therefore necessary that C, 0' shall be such as to start and

M Cin the same direction. This condition will enable C and to be determined.

   M CLet the two given displacements convey L and to L' and M', then and

are two generators of the hyperboloid of which X, X', and L' M', are three genera-

tors of the other system. But when two hyperboloids are such that a pair of

generators of one system on one hyherboloid are conjugate polars of the other,

then a pair of generators of the other system are also conjugate polars. Obser-

Xving that and X' are conjugate polars of the absolute we therefore have C and

C completely determined.

9. On the deduction of Trigonometrical from Elliptic Function Formulae.
                     By J. W. L. Glaisheb, M.A., F.B.8.

    In any elliptic function identity, connecting sn's, en's, and dn's, we may, of
course, as is well known, put k = 0, when the sn's and en's become respectively
sines and cosines and the dn becomes unity. But we may also expand the elliptic

functions in powers of /c^, and equate the coefficients of k'^, k*, Szc, to zero.
Considering only terms as far as k^, it can be shown that

so that          am u = u -- \ k'^u + ^k'' sin 2m                                 ..
         --sn M = sin u i k'^u cos u + -^ k- sin 2m cos m
         --en M = cos u + ^ k^u sin it ^ A;' sin 2u sin u
         --dn M = 1 u^k''' s\v?

Now the terms - ^ k-u cos u and ^ Fm sin u, in which the argument appeal's out-

side, will generally lead to terms which, on this account, are separately equal

to zero, so that in deducing trigonometrical from elliptic function formulae (in

which the arguments do not appear as external factors), we may put

         sn M = sin M (1 + 5 k^ cos'^ m)
                                                               ^
         --en M = cos M (1
                            ^k"^ sin'^ m) ^ . . . (1)

         duM =  l -- ^k'^ain'u )

and equate the powers of k"^ to zero.

    As an example, consider the elliptic function identity

         sn ^ sn y sn (/3 -- y) + sn y sn a sn fy -- a) + sn a sn /3 sn (a -- ^)

                   O =0+ sn -- y) sn (y -- a) sn (a -- /3)

putting k = 0, we obtain the well-known trigonometrical identity

-- --sin /3 sin y sin (/3                       a) + sin a sin ^ sin (a - j3)
         y) + sin y sin a sin (y
         -- --+ sin (^ - y) sin (y
                a) sin (a                          =/3)     0, . . . (2"^
478 REPORT--1880.

but substituting for the sn's by (1), and equating tlie coefScient of k^ to zero, we

have     -- --sin ^ sin y sin (/3 y) [cos -/3 + cos -y + cos ^(^ y) ]

         --+ sin y sin a sin (y -- a) [cos -y + cos "a + cos ~(y a) ]

         -- --+ sin a sin /3 sin (a ^) [cos -a + cos -/3 + cos ''(a /3) ]

+ sin (/3 - y) sin (y - a) sin (a -/3) [cos^(/3 - y) + cos'^(y-a) + cos^(a - /3) ] = 0,

wbich, in virtue of (2), may be written

         O --sin j3 sin y sin
                            -- y) [siQ-/3 + sin^y + sin^O  y)]

         --+ sin y sin a sin (y - a) [sin ^y + sin ^a + sin '^(y a)]

            -- --+ sin a sin /3 sin (a (3) [sin ^a + sin -(3 + sin*(a /3)]
-- --- - -+ sin (/3 y) sin (y a) sin (a -/3) [sin ^((3 y) + sin^(y a) + ain*(a ^)]

                                                                             = 0...(3)

Similarly from

                 sn a sn (/3 -- y) + sn ^ sn (y -- a) + sn y sn (a -- 0)
                -- -- --+ A;^ sn a sn /3 sn 7 sn (/3 y) sn (y a) sn (a =/3)

we have, by putting k = 0,

         O --sin a sin
                - y) + sin /3 sin (y a) + sin y sin (a -- ^) = 0,

and, by equating to zero the coeiBcient of k",

                -- --sin a sin (/3
                            y) [sin ^a + sin ^(/3  y) ]

         -- -+ sin /3 sin (y
                            a) [sin -/3 + sin -(y  a) ]

         -- --+ sin y sin (a
                            /3) [sin "y + sin -(a  /3) ]

         -- --- - =4 sin a sin /3 sin y sin (/3 y) sin (y a) sin (a /3)

If the object be, not to deduce trigonometrical formulae from elliptic function

formulae, but to verify the latter, the formulae deduced by equating to zero the

coefficient of k'' obtained by means of (1), generally afford a much better verifica-
tion than is obtained by merely putting k = 0.

It may be mentioned that (3) may be easily verified by use of (2) and of the

formula

         -- --sin'.r + sin"y.+ sin^(.r y) = 2 - 2 cos .r cos «/ cos (i' y).

10. On Plane and S^lierical Curves of the Fourth Glass with Quadruple Foci.
                             By Henry M. Jeffery, F.B.8.

                I. On Plane Olass-Quaetics.

1. All quartics with quadruple foci may be expressed by the geometrical rela-

tion

                            Kp* = qr + \

Rif the line-coordinates p, q, r denote the quadruple focus P, and Q, the foci of

the satellite-conic.

   RIt is proposed to examine every possible quartic in a group, in which P, Q,

remain unaltered, while the parameters, k, X, vary indefinitely.

    When2. there are critical bitangential quartics in a group, the mutual relation

of K, X will be exhibited in a plane curve, of which they are the coordinates.
     This locus will be hereinafter designated the bounding curve, by which plane

space will be divided into regions. In some regions no quartic is possible, and if

K, X represent points on the bounding curve, critical quartics exist, with real or

imaginary bi-tangents. If two branches intersect in a node or imite in a cusp, two

bi-tangents will unite to form some higher singularity. In the remaining regions
quartics will occur, which alter their character as k or X becomes zero, i.e. as the
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                 479

loounding curve intersects the axes, and in other transition-cases, which will he

explained in § 8.

     3. Order-quartics, whether singular or non-singular, have been classified by Dr.

Zeuthen, of Copenhagen (' Matheaiatische Annalen,' 1874), according to their

depressions, characterised by a bi-tangent and two points of inflexion ; such pits

are termed by that eminent geometer, /b/m (although ybye« might be thought more

expressive). So class-quartics may have four or fewer stirrup-like excrescences.
-- ADef.
          stapes or stapete is characterised by two cusps and a crunode. By a

stapete-point is meant such an excrescence in its nascent state, just as a folium-point

(foveate) or a point of undulation is an incipient depression. The stapetes and

folia are reciprocal, and either do or do not constitute singularities, just as the curve

is regai'ded by its class or order.

          Ex.        a* + 4/33y = ; 27 (apY + 64 {bqY cr = o.

     These equations denote the same quartic, with one stapete-point and one folium-
point. In passing from one form to the other, 8 dimensions are lost : for (a, ^) is a
triple stapete-point with three singularities, and (a, y) is a point of undulation with
none. Contrariwise q is the same foliiun point with a triple tangent, and 7- a
point with no singularity. The same contradiction and parallelism occiu' in cusped

cubics, which are always inflexional. So that these conclusions may be gene-

ralised. Since

                  a" + M^"-!-)/ = o; (n - l)»-i (apY = (- nhq)"-'^ cr,

denote the same curve, n(n -- 2) dimensions are lost by the mergence of cusps and

nodes, or of stationary and bi-tangents at the points B, C.
     4. The positions of the quadi'uple focus P, and of the foci Q, E. of the satellite-

conic, will be distinguished in five families of groups.

         R RI. P, Q, collinear : Q, coincident in the centre of a satellite circle.
        R Rn. P, Q, collinear : Q, the foci of a satellite conic.
       R RIII. P, Q, not collinear, but Q, at an infinite distance.
       R Q RIV. P, Q, not collinear, but or at a finite distance.
        RV. P, Q, unrestricted.

    PThe special forms should be noted, when is at an infinite distance.

     5. The process adopted will be exemplified in family I., thus represented by the
Boothian equation.

P PQis the origin ;  = a, the distance of the double focus of the satellite conic.

By partial difierentiation,

          $a-o = «!)' + 2X|(f + ^^) - «(1 - a$) (f + r,^)

          o = ,;(l-«|)^ + 2X,(^ + ,^).

The factor (»; = o) alone yields bitangential values.

                ^It r, = 0,2k = (1 - ai)

                               2X|' + (1 - a$) (I - 2fl^) = o.

If it be thought necessai^y, the equation to this unicursal bounding curve will be
foimd explicitly to be a quintic

          V^-2. _ I8a3 + sexV - ( - - 14a« + 4X -(a'^ 8X)

But hereafter the explicit equation to the bounding curves will be rarely deter-

mined.

y =--6. At a singular point on the quintic
                                     =o     ; there are two cusps, one

at infinity, when ^ = o, at the extremity of the (X) axis, and another, when
3«| = 2, 8X = a\ 27a\ = 2.
--480
          REPORT 1 880.

    There is a single asymptote \ + a^ = o, wlien ^ = <x.  No points of inflexion,

distinct from the cusps, satisfy the condition

          ^(Pk dK _ drX (h                         ~_  "

          dj' d$ d$'

7. By the aid of this bounding quintic allquartics maybe exhibited, which hava

a quadruple focus and a satellite-circle.

    If in such a group of §5, 8X = d^, 27a^K. = 2, so that (k, X) is a ceratoid cusp

on the bounding quintic, the quartic

f U|.«Y + (I «^p - 2«| + l) '?^ +
                                                   (9«^ + 2) (l -  =o

is inflexional.

      In a family of such groups, the locus of the point of inflexion is the hyperbola

(108kX = 1).

     For values of (k, X) on points in the neighbourhood of the cusp, the quartics are
veribantangential with two cusps of the cardioid type, or acubitangential, as
(k, X) is situated on one or other of the branches which meet at the cusp. For points
within this space, the quartics consist of an oval, pierced by the hyperbolic branches
of another non-stapete or smooth oval. For points beyond this space the quartics
are bistapete with four, two, or no asymptotes, and also become smooth according

to the position of (k, X). It may suffice here to state, that for other critical values

of (k, X), one or other negative, the quartics are lima^onoid, i.e. unistapete in the

nascent form, or have bicusped bi-tangents, the reciprocals of biflecnoids, i.e., are

bistapete in the nascent state.

    8. Non-singular quartics may change their stapetes, without passing through
critical values; the stapete-points of transition are determined by aid of the
Hessian of the group, or by means of the invariants S, T, equated to zero.

     Let the centre of the satellite circle be at infinity. Such a group

has no critical bitangential quartics, but its stapetes vary with X. The Hessian of

the group is

          f-(4X- + 6X + 2) ^* + (8X^ + 8X I) ,,^ + (iX^ + 2X) r,* = o.

The real values of these points, which constitute the Hessian, and of the coincident
stapete-points, depend upon the auxiliary quadratic

          32X2 + 32X = 1,

whose roots are -03033 and - 1-03033.

Other transition-values of X are 0, -- -6, --1.

If X = '03 or -- 1-03 the quartics have fom- stapete-points.

X = -- -5, there are two stapete-points.

--\ = or  1 , there is a tacnode at infinity,

or the quadric is bistapete in its nascent state.

For intermediate or external values the quartics are quadristapete, bistapete,

or nonstapete.

    9. This slight sketch may suffice to explain the plan of this chapter of Plane
and a corresponding chapter iu Spherical Class-Quartics, which, it is hoped, may

shortly find a place in the ' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,' illustrated by the

necessary diagrams.

shows that the straight lines joining any point on it to the circular points at infinity

are conjugate with respect to the conic.

  --This is a particular case of the following theorem : If from two fixed points

through its point of contact, the above locus must pass through the points of

contact of the tangents to the conic from the given points. This theorem enahles

us to wi'ite down the equation to the known conic passing through two given
points, and the points of contact of tangent from those pomts to a given conic.

     To return to the particular case of the du-ector circle. The tangents from
the circular points at infinity intersect in the foci : the points of contact must
therefore lie on the polars of the foci, i.e. on the directrices. Heuce the director
circle of a conic passes through the intersections of the directrices with the conic.

In other words, the directnces of a conic are the chords of intersection of the conic

15. Note on a Trigonometrical Identity involvinq products of Four Sines.

                      By J. W. L. Glaisher, M.A.', F.B.8.

     In a paper in the * Messenger of Mathematics ' (vol. x. p. 26), the author had

drawn attention to the following identity :--

                                 sin a sin b sin c sin d

                              = sin «' sin b' sin c' sin d'

                              + sin a" sin 6" sin c" sin d"

where a, b, c, d are any four quantities, and a', b', c' . d', a", b", c", d" eight quan-
tities derived fi'om them by the equations

      a' = ^ (-- o + 6 + c + <f),             a" = ^{a + b + c + d),
      a-b6' = i (
                                  + c + d),   b" = i.(a + b - c - d),
                                              c" =· ^{a - b + c -- d),
      c' = ^( a + b -- c + d),                d" = ^{a -- b - c + ct),
      --d' = i I 'a + b + c
                                         d),

and in this note he pointed out that this was a particular case of a more general

formula involving products of foui- sines.

    The foregomg identity may he written

          sin rt sin 6 sin c sin d                                                            (1)

       16. On the Periods of the First Glass of Hyper-elliptic Integrals.
                             By William R. Roberts, M.A.

     I investi^^ate the periods of hvper-elliptic functions by a method analogous to
that which has been adopted by Schloemilch for the determination of the periods

of elliptic integrals. By this method I determine the periodicity of hyper-elliptic

inteo-rals without integxating the equations.

pends on four integrals, which I call respectively, 2*, 2S, 2in, and 2i* ; and in

a similar manner I arrive at the general value of the integral / f{z)z"dz. The

mode of investigation which I adopt for the determination of these integrals afibrds
a proof that the equation

                                                  = = (-1)^1

satisfies both the transcendental equations.

      17. On the Integral of Laplace^s Equation in Finite Terms.
                       By the Rev. S. Earnshaw, M.A.

                       The Integkal of Laplace's EciTrATioN.

The equation to which this title refers is the following :

                                          ^u(Pu      _d'-u    fx  ^1,

and I am desirous of the three following propositions being communicated to Sec-

--tion A, at the meeting of the British Association at Swansea.
     Prop. A. The independent variables .r, i/, z are in this equation not necessarily

the coordinates of some point P, in space referred to a fixed rectangular system of

Wecoordinate axes O.r, Oy, Oz.                       shall, however, h)^othetically treat them as

such ; and therefore we say that

                                          0P2 = r- = .r'2 + if + s^

Now from draw any two lines, OA, OB, at right angles to each other, and let ^,

OPT) represent the lengths of the rectangular projections of                   upon these two

arbitrary lines ; then vsrill the following be a general integral of Laplace's equation

given above,

                                     u = A/'^ cos (ar] + 6) .... (2)

in which A, a, b are arbitrary constants which have no reference whatever to the

ajbitrary positions of OA, OB.
                                                                                                                           --

                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                        487

      It will also be noticed that, b being arbitrary, the integral (2) is equivalent to

two conjugate integrals, and may be more completely written thus,

                                          M = e ^(Acos«i; + Bsinrt7).

OBThe generality of this integral is due to the circumstance that the two lines OA,

(on which |, ij are the projections of »·) are perfectly arbitrary as to their direc-

tions in space, while ^, rj are entirely dependent, for their values in terms of .r, t/,

z, on the positions of OA, OB.

    Every different position of OA, OB, or of either of them, will give a special

integral, though every such special integral will be of the common type (2). Each

special integral will have its own arbitrary (or special) constants in the place of A,

a,  b           and any of  such     special     integrals   may be       formed    by addition              into  a   group,
             ;

which group will be an integral of equation (1).

    There is no limit to the number of groups, but every gTOup will be composed of

integrals of the type (2) ; and it is in reference to this property that we designate
We AOP(2) the general integral.
                                                 may mention that^ = ?· cos                        and ?; = ?· cos BOP,

and these cosines are easily expressed in terms of .r, y, z, and the arbitrary angles

which OA, OB make with the coordinate axes.

   --Pnqy. B. If now a third line OC be drawn at right angles to both the lines

OBOA,           ; and if f be the length of the projection of r on OC, then will the

following differential equation hold good akvays, i.e. whatever be the positions of

OA, OB, OC!,

4. On a Septum permeahle to Water and impermeable to Air, with practical
   applications to a Navigational Depth-gauge. By Professor Sir William

    Thomson, At.A., F.B.S.

      A. small quantity of Avater in a capillary tube, with both ends in air, acts as a
perfectly air-tight plug against diiference of pressure of air at its two ends, equal
to the hydrostatic pressure corresponding to the height at which water stands in

the same capillaiy tube when it is held upright, with one end under water and the

other in air. And if the same capillary tube be held completely under water, it is

perfectly permeable to the water, opposing no resistance except that due to viscidity,
and permitting a current of water to flow through it with any difierence of pressure

at its two ends, however small. In passing it may be remarked that the same
capillary tube is, when not plugged by liquid, perfectly permeable to air.

    A plate of glass, or other solid, capable of being perfectly wet by water, with a

hole bored through it, acts similarly in letting air pass freely through it when
there is no water in the hole; and letting water pass freely through it when it is
held under water ; and resisting a difierence of air-pressures at the two sides of it
when the hole is plugged by water. The difierence of air-pressures on the two
 sides which it resists is equal to the hydrostatic pressm-e corresponding to the rise
 of water in a capillary tube of the same diameter as the narrowest part of the
hole. Thus a metal plate with a great many fine perforations, like a very fine rose
for a watering-can for flowers, fulfils the conditions stated in the title to this com-
 munication. So does very fine wire cloth. The finer the holes, the greater is the
 difference of air-pressures balanced, when they are plugged with water. The
shorter the length of each hole the less it resists the passage of water when com-
 pletely submerged ; and the greater the number of boles, the less is the whole re-

 sistance to the permeation of water through the membrane.
      Hence, clearly, the object indicated in the title is more perfectly attained the

 thinner the plate and the smaller and more numerous the holes. Very fine wire
 cloth woidd answer the purpose better than any metal plate with holes drilled
 through it ; and very fine closelj'-woven cotton cloth, or cambric, answers better
than the finest wire cloth. The impenetrability of wet cloth to air is well known

to laundresses, and to every naturalist who has ever chanced to watch their

 operations. The quality of dry cloth to let air through vdth considerable freedom,
 and wet cloth to resist it, is well known to sailors, wet sails being sensibly more

effective than dry sails (and particularly so in the case of old sails, and of sails of

thin and light material).

    An illustration was shown to the meeting by taking an Argand lamp-funnel,
with a piece of very fine closely-woven cotton cloth tied over one end of it. When

the cloth was dry, and the other end dipped under water, the water rose with

perfect freedom inside, showing exceedingly little resistance to the passage of air

through the dry cloth. When it was inverted, and the end guarded by the cloth

held under water, the water rose with very great freedom, sho-wdng exceed-
ingly little resistance to the permeation of water through the cloth. The cloth

being now wet, and the glass once more held with its other end under water, the
cloth now seemed perfectly air-tight, even when pressed with air-pressure corre-
sponding to nine inches of water, by forcing down the funnel, which was about
nine inches long, till the upper end was nearly submerged. When it was wholly

submerged, so that there was air on one side and water on the other the resistance
to permeation of air was as decided as it was when the cloth, very perfectly wet,

had air on each side of it.

     Once more, putting the cloth end imder water ; holding the tube nearly hori-

--zontal, and blowing by the mouth applied to the other end : the water which had

risen into the funnel before the mouth was applied, was expelled. After that no
air escaped until the air-pressure -wathin exceeded the water pressure on the outside
of the cloth by the equivalent of a little more than nine inches of water ; and when
blown with a pressure just a very little more than that which sufficed to produce a
bubble from* any part of the cloth, bubbles escaped in a copious torrent from the

whole area of the cloth.

Water indicated by horizontal shading ; air by white paper.

The accompanying sketch represents the application to the Navigational Depth-

gauge. The wider of the two communicating tubes, shown uppermost in the

sketch, has its open mouth guarded by very fine cotton cloth tied across it. The

tube shown lower in the diagram is closed for the time of use by a stopper at its

Alower end.  certain quantity of water (which had been forced into it during the

descent of the gauge to the bottom of the sea) is retained in it while the gauge is

being towed up to the surface in some such oblique position as that shown in the

sketch. While this is being done the water in the wide tube is expelled by the

expanding air. The object of the cloth guard is to secure that this water is expelled

to the last drop before any air escapes ; and that afterwards, while the gauge is

being towed wildly along the surface from wave to wave by a steamer running at

fourteen or sixteen knots, not a drop of water shall re-enter the instrument.

     5. On the Effect of Oil in destroying Waves on the Siirface of Water.
                 By Professor Osboene Reynolds, M.A., F.B.S.

     This paper contauied a short accoimt of an investigation from -which it ap-
peared that the effect of oil on the surface of water to prevent wind-waves and
destroy waves alreadj' existing, was owing to the surface-tension of the water over
which the oil spread varying inversely as the thickness of the oil, thus introducing

tangential stiffness into the oil-sheet, which prevented the oil taking up the tan*
gential motion of the water beneath. Several other phenomena were also men-
tioned. The author hopes shortly to publish a fuU account of the investigation.

6. Experiments on thin Films of Water, with regard to their absorption of

                  Eadiant Heat. By the Hon. F. A. R. Russell.

The experiments, the general results of which are given below, were made

with the object of ascertaining the diathermancy of water in very thin films, and

these experiments afforded incidentally an opportunity of observing the behaviour

of films subject to varying conditions.

     The arrangement of instruments was similar to that illustrated at p. 383 of
Prof. Tyndall's ' Heat as a Mode of Motion.' The instruments used were : a dead-
beat mirror galvanometer and scale, a thermopile, and a screen. The soap film

was carried by a piece of a cork sole perforated by a hole slightly larger than the

hole in the screen, about 1 j inches in diameter. The sources of heat were (1) a

copper  or  iron ball heated from behind  by  a  small  gas flame                                        (2) a common gas
                                                                                                      ;

flame from a Bunsen burner, and (3) a hydrogen flame in air.

The film was mostly made from a solution of about half a drachm of shavings

of Castile soap, dissolved 5 to 15 minutes in about 5 cubic inches of water, at 60°

Fahrenheit.

The film soon after being placed perpendicularly at the orifice hi the screen

exhibited coloured bauds, which descended in regular succession until the last

band appeared, which contained a bright blue line. The descent of the bands

continued at a slackened rate tiU the grey, and finally the black, occupied a portion

Aof the upper half of the film, which half was alone subject to experiment.

condition more or less of equilibrium then prevailed, the tension of the black

Aportion counteracting the force of gravity.     light yellow or bronze was always

the last colour to appear, and preceded the white or grey, which again was

succeeded by black. When there was any black in the film, the bursting of the

film was marked by a slight click or snapping sound. The best films lasted

frequently between 10 and 30 minutes, and sometimes the black portion alone

was under observation 15 or 20 minutes.

The following table shows the absorption per cent, for each of the three sources

of heat, and the thickness of the film, as derived from a table in Watts's ' Dictionary

Aof Chemistry,' giving Newton's thicknesses of thin films of air, water, and glass.

7. On an Experimental Illustration of Minimum Energy in Vortex Motion.
               By Professor Sir William Thomson, M.A., F.B.8.

     This illustration consists of a liquid gyrostat of exactly the same construction
as that described and represented by the annexed drawing, repeated from ' Nature,'

February 1, 1877, pp. 297-298,
with the difference that the figure

of the shell is prolate instead of

oblate. The experiment was in

fact conducted with the actual

apparatus which was exhibited

to the British Association at

Glasgow in 1876, altered by the

substitution of a shell having its

equatorial diameter about      f-,  of

its axial diameter, for the shell

--with axial diameter of equato-

rial diameter which was used

when the apparatus was shown

as a successful gyi-ostat. The

oblate and prolate shells were

each of them made from the

two hemispheres of sheet copper

which plumbers solder together
to make their globular floaters.

By a little hammering it is easy

to alter the hemispheres to the

proper shapes to make either the        - 7. tNCHES-

prolate or the oblate figure.

     Theory had pointed out that the rotation of a liquid in a rigid shell of oval figure,

being a configuration of maximum energy for given vorticity, would be unstable

if the containing vessel is left

to itself supported on imperfectly

elastic supports, although it would

be stable if the vessel were held

absolutely fixed, or borne by per-

fectly elastic supports, or left to

itself in space unacted on by ex-

ternal force ; and it was to illus-

trate this theory that the oval

shell was made and filled with

water and placed in the appara-

tus. The result of the first trial
was literally startling, although

it ought not to have been so, as

it was merely a realisation of
what had been anticipated by

theory. The fi'amework was held

as firmly as possible by one per-

son with his two hands, keeping

it as steady as he could. The spinning by means of a fine cord' round a small

492 REPORT-- 1880.

V pulley of ^-inch diameter on the axis of the oval shell, and passing round a

large fly-wheel of three feet diameter turned at the rate of ahout one round per
second, was continued for several minutes. This in the case of the oblate shell,

as was known from previous experiments, would have given amply sufficient rota-

tion to the contained water to cause the apparatus to act with great firmness like a
solid gyrostat. In the first experiment with the oval shell the shell was seen to be

rotating with great velocity dming the last minute of the spimiing ; but the moment

it was released from the cord, and when, holding the framework in my hands, I com-

menced carrying it towards the horizontal glass table to test its gyrostatic quality,

the framework which I held in my hands gave a violent uncontrollable lurch, and

in a few seconds the shell stopped turning. I saw that one of the pivots had
become bent over, by j'ielding of the copper shell in the neighbourhood of the
stiff pivot-carrying disk, soldered to it, showing that the liquid had exerted a very
strong couple against its containing shell, in a plane through the axis, the efltbrt to

resist which by my hands had bent the pivot. The shell was refitted with more

strongly attached pivots, and the experiment has been repeated several times. In
every case a decided uneasiness of the framework is perceived by the person holding
it in his hands during the spinning ; and as soon as the cord is cut and the person
holding it carries it towards the experimental table, the framework begins, as it
were, to wriggle round in his hands, and by the time the framework is placed on
the table the rotation is nearly all gone. Its utter failure as a gyrostat is pre-
cisely what was expected from the theory, and presents a truly wonderful contrast
to what is observed with the apparatus and operations in every respect similar,
except having an oblate instead of a prolate shell to contain the liquid.

8. On a Dlsturhing Infinity in Lord RayleigJi's Solution for Waves in a
     Plane Vortex Stratum. By Professor Sir Willum Thomson, M.A.,

      F.B.S.

     Lord Rayleigh's solution involves a formula equivalent to

                                        0.

Where v denotes the maximum value of the y-component of velocity

                                                                 9

T,, ,, the translational velocity of the vortex-stratum when undis-

turbed, which is in the a-direction, and is a function of y ;

--,, n ,, the vibrational speed, or a constant such that            2rr  is the period.

Now a vortex stratum is stable, if on one side it is bounded by a fixed plane,

----and if the vorticity ( or value of    diminishes as we travel (ideally) from this

                                        )

plane, except in places (if any) where it is constant.

     To fulfil this condition, suppose a fixed bounding plane to contain o x and be

Tperpendicular \a oy; and let d---- have its greatest value when y = o, and decrease

continuously, or by one or more abrupt changes, from this value, to zero &iy = a

and for all greater values of y.
     It is easily proved that the wave-velocity, whatever be the wave-length, is in-

termediate between the greatest and least values of T. Hence for a certain value
of y between and «, the translational velocity is equal to the wave-velocity, or

as long a time as is judged proper, the endless cord is cut with a pair of scissors and

the gyrostiat is released.

Rayleigh's formula is infinite unless, for the same value of y, -j--^ vanishes.

   We evade entirely the consideration of this infinity if we take only the case of

a layer of constant vorticity f- = constant from y = o to y = a\, as for this case

the formula is simply ^;' = m" v, hut the interpretation of the infinity which

occurs in the more comprehensive formula suggests an examination of the stream-
lines by which its interpretation becomes obvious, and which proves that even in
the case of constant vorticity the motion has a startlingly peculiar^ character at the
place where the translational velocity is equal to the wave-velocity. This pecu-
liarity is represented by the annexed diagram, which is most easily understood if

we imagine the translational velocities at y = and ?/ = n to be in opposite direc-
tions, and of such magnitude that the wave-velocity is zero ; so that we have the

case of standing waves. For this case the stream lines are as represented in the
annexed diagram, in which the region of translational velocity greater than wave-

propagational velocity is separated from the region of translational velocity less

than wave-propagational velocity by a cat's-eye border pattern of elliptic whirls.

9. Supplement to a Paper on the SyncJironism of Mean Temperature and
   Rainfall in the Climate of London. By H. Courtenay Fox, M.B.C.S.

In the Report of the British Association for 1879, page 277, is an abstract of a

paper on the above subject which I had the pleasure of reading last year. The

--rainfaU-data which I tlien used were of two kinds namely, first, the monthly

rainfall  at  the Royal  Observatory back to  the  year  1841                            and, secondly (for  the
                                                                                      ;

years 1813 to 1840), the rainfall for every month collected by Mr. Dines from

sundry observations about London. After I had presented this paper, Mr. Glaisher

kindly favoured me with a table of the monthly rainfall at Greenwich, going back

to the year 1815.

    I have since gone carefully through my paper with it, and am glad to state

that the results which I ventiu-ed to ofler to the Association are, with small excep-

tion, fully confirmed.

     Conclusion No. 1 is confirmed, with the exception that February loses the

svnchronism of cold with dry, although that of warm with wet is retained.

     Conclusions Nos. 2 and 3 are confirmed.

   --Conclusion No. 4 ; The results for April and November are unchanged. The

four remaining months, though in some respects they presented ' slight ' tendencies
to the association of extremes of rainfall and temperature, were more or less
indefinite in character. This is still the case as regards March, September, and

October, but in May the tendency is for the synchronism of cold with wet to

prevail.

used the same method, but with movable discs for the contact electricity, after the

method of Volta, and my own quadrant electrometer substituted for the gold-leaf

electroscope by which Volta himself obtained his electric indications, in an extended
series of experiments which I made in the years 1859-61.

     I was on the point of transmitting to the Royal Society a paper which I had
written describing these experiments, and which I still have in manuscript, when I
found a paper by Hankel in Poggendorif's ' Annalen ' for January 1862, in which

results altogether in accordance with my own were given, and I withheld my paper

till I mio'ht be able not merely to describe a new method, but, if possible, add some-

thino- to the available information regarding the properties of matter to be found in

Hankel's paper. I have made many experiments from time to time since 1861 by
the same method ; but have obtained results merely confirmatory of what had been
published by Pfaff in 1820 or 1821, showing the phenomena of contact electricity
to be independent of the surrounding gas, and agreeing in the main with the
numerical values of the contact differences of difierent metals which Hankel had

published ; and 1 have therefore hitherto published nothing except the slight state-

ments regarding contact electricity which appear iu my ' Electrostatics and Magne-

tism.' As interest has been recently revived in the subject of contact electricity,
the foUowin"- description of my method may possibly prove useful to experimenters.

The same method has been used to very good effect, but with a Bohnenberger

myelectroscope instead of  quadrant electrometer, in researches on contact electricity

by Monsieur II. Pellat, described in the ' Journal de Physique ' for May 1880.

     The apparatus used in these experiments was designed to secure the following

--conditions : To support two circular discs of metal about four inches in diameter

in such a way that the opposing surfaces should be exactly parallel to each other

and approximately horizontal ; and that the distance between them might be
~varied at pleasure from a shortest distance of about
                                                       of an inch to about a

quarter or half an inch. The lower plate, which was the iusidated one, was fixed

in a glass stem rising from the centre of a cast-iron sole plate. The upper plate

was suspended by a chain to the lower end of a brass rod sliding through a steady-
Aing socket iu the upper part of the case.
                                            stout brass flange fixed to the lower

end of this rod bears three screws, one of which, S, is shown in the drawing, by

which the upper plate can be adjusted to parallelism to the lower plate. The other

apparatus used consisted of a quadrant electrometer and a gravity Daniell's cell of

the form which I described in ' Proc. R. S.' 1871 (pp. 253-259) with a divider by

which any integral number of per cents, from to 100 of the electromotive force

of the cell could be established between any two mutually insulated homogeneous

metals in the apparatus.

                                                                                   .

     I had a smaller apparatus, with Volta discs of only about half an inch diameter,,
and with gas-tig-ht enclosing case, constructed in the year 1871 ; and I have made

many experiments with it, of which I hope soon to publish an account.

                                                                    Connections.

     The insulated plate was connected by a stiff brass wire passing through a wide
enough hole in the case of the Volta condenser to the electrode of the insulated
pair of quadrants. The upper plate was connected to the metal case of the Volta
condenser and to the metal case of the electrometer, one pair of quadrants of which
were also connected to the case. One of the terminals of the divider, which con-
nected the poles of the cell through a graduated resistance coil, was connected to
the case of the electrometer, and to the other terminal was attached one of the con-
tact wires, which was a length of insulated copper wire having soldered to its outer
end a short piece of platinum. The other contact piece was a similar short piece of
platinum fixed to the insulated electrode of the electrometer. Hence it will be seen
that metallic communication between the two plates was effected by putting the
divider at zero and bringing into contact the two pieces of platinum wire.

                                                 Order of Experiment.

     The sliding piece of the divider was put to zero, and contact made and broken
and the upper plate raised, and the deflection of the spot of light was observed.
These operations were repeated with the sliding piece at different numbers on the
divider scale until one was found at which the make-break and separation caused
no perceptible deflection. The number thus found on the divider scale was the
number of hundredths of the electro-motive force of the cell, which was equal to

the contact electric difference of the discs in the Volta condenser.

   --[Addenchwi, November 23, 1880. Since the communication of this paper to the

British Association, I have found that a dry platinum disc, kept for some time in
dry hydrogen gas, and then put into its position in dry atmospheric air in the
apparatus for contact electricity, becomes positive to another platinum disc which
had not been so treated, but had simply been left undisturbed in the apparatus.
The positive quality thus produced by the hydrogen diminishes gradually, and
becomes insensible after two or three days.]

5. On a method of detertnim,ing without mechanism the limiting Steam-
   Liquid Temperature of a Fluid. By Professor Sir William Thomson,

    M.A., F.B.S.

   A -- --piece of straight glass tube 60 centimetres is a convenient length is to be

filled with the substance in a state of the greatest purity possible. It is to contain
such a quantity of the substance that, at ordinary atmospheric temperatures, about
3 or 4 centimetres of the tube are occupied by steam of the substance, and the re-
mainder liquid. Fix the tube in an upright position, with convenient appliances
for warming the upper 10 centimetres of the lengtli to the critical temperature, or

to whatever higher or lower temperature may be desired ; and for warming a length
of 40 centimetres from the bottom to some lower temperature, and varying its

temperature conveniently at pleasure.

     Commence by warming the upper part until the surface of separation of liquid
and steam sinks below 5 centimetres from the top. Then warm the lowest part

until the surface rises again to a convenient position. Operate thus, keeping the
surface of separation of liquid and solid at as nearly as possible a constant position of
3 centimetres below the top of the tube, until the surface of separation disappears.

     The temperature of the tube at the place where the surface of separation was seen
immediately before disappearance is the critical temperature.

    It may be remarked that the changes of bulk produced by the screw and mercury
in Andrews' apparatus are, in the method now described, produced by elevations
and depressions of temperature in the lower thermal vessel. By proper arrange-
ments these elevations and depressions of temperature may be made as easily, and
in some cases as rapidly, as by the turning of a screw. The dispensing with all

mechanism and joints, and the simplicity afforded by using the substance to be ex-
                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                  497

   perimented upon, and no other sutstance in contact with it, in a liei-metically sealed

   cwlass vessel are advantanres in the method now described. It is also interesting to
   remark that in this method we have continuity through the fluid itself all at one

   equal pressure exceeding the critical pressure, but at different temperatures in
   different parts, varying continuously from something above the critical tempei-ature
   at the top of the tube to a temperature below the critical temperature in the lower

   part of the tube.

       The pressure may actually be measured by a proper appliance on the outside of

   the lower part of the tube to measure its augmentation of volume under applied
   pressure. If this is to be done, the lower thermal vessel must be applied, not
   round the bottom of the tube, but round the middle poi'tion of it, leaving, as already
   described, 10 or 20 cms. above for observation of the surface of separation between
   liquid and vapour, and leaving at the bottom of the tube 20 or 30 cms. for the

   pressure-measuring appliance.

        This appliance would be on the same general principle as that adopted by Pro-
   fessor Tait in his tests of the Challcmjer thermometers under great pressure (' Proceed-
   ings Royal Soc. Edin.,' 1830) ; a principle which I have myself used in a form of
   depth-gauge for deep-sea soundings ; in which the pressure is measured, not by the
   compression of air, but bj' the flexure or other strain produced iu brass or glass or

   other elastic solid.

                      Electro-magnetic Forces. By Qc. F. Fitzgerald.

   7. On the Ntiviber of Electrostatic Units in the Electro-magnetic Unit.
       By R. Shida, M.E., Imperial College of Engineering, Tokio, Japan.

   The obiect of this paper is to explain measurements made during the month of

   July last for an evaluation of ' c,' the number of electrostatic units in the electro-

   --ma"-netic unit a question which has much engaged the attention of the British

   Association.  We can evaluate ' i' ' by determining the electrostatic and also

   tl\e electro-magnetic measure of anyone of the following terms: Electro-motive

   Force, Resistance, Cm-rent, Quantitj^ and Capacity. It is tlie first of these terms
   that I measured in the two systems of units, and the E. M. F. was that of Sir
   AVm. Thomson's gravity Daniell, which is very constant. The question divides itself

   into two parts.
        (A). Absolute electrostatic measurement of the E. M. F.
        This measurement was made by means of Sir AVm. Thomson's Absolute

   Electrometer, the most perfect instrument of the land hitherto invented. As the

   description and principle of this instrument will be found fully given in Sir

   Wm. Thomson's ' Electrostatics and Magnetism,' I need not enter into these

   explanations. I may mention, however, that the instrument, perfect as it is, will

   not give accurate results unless considerable care be taken in using it.

   In measuring an E. M. F. by this instrument, it is important tliat the potential

   of the jar or the guard ring or disc should be kept constant during the experiment.
   It was observed, however, tliat the jar was losing its charge, though very slowly,

   on account of the pieces of ebonite in the replenisher insulating Imperfectly. Of

   course I could keep the potential of the jar the .same during the experiment by

   means of the replenisher ; but I found it very diflicult to work the replenisher, and

   to take at the same time accurate readings. For this reason I thought it better,

   when the experiment is done by one experimenter, (or even when, I venture to think,

   there are more experimenters than one) to proceed in the following manner. First,

   connect one pole, say zinc, to the continuous plate, and the other pole to the outside

   --of the jar, and take a reading ; then reverse the poles and take another reading.

   Repeat the same operation that is to say, take a great number of readings by

   successive reversals. If the experimenter be well practised, the time each reading

   will take him will be very nearly the same. Let D,, U.,, D,, kc, be the readings

corresponding to zinc, and D',, D'n, D'3, &c. be those correspoudincr to copper, tlien

the difference of the two readings of zinc and copper -would be the diiference

between the mean of any consecutive readings of one pole and the reading of the

other taken between those two consecutive readings, such, for example, as
-- ----L-- a - D'jjor !-i
                           - Dj, &c. Thus we get many values very nearly the

same, if not exactly the same, of the  true  difference  in  question                                          weif, therefore,
                                                                                                            ;

take the mean of all these, the error due not only to a small loss of charge, but also

to a little inaccuracy in the readings, will be avoided. This is the method I used

in measuring the E. M. F. of 30 Daniell cells, and the result I obtained is the mean

defined as above = 13'283 divisions of the micrometer screw-head. As regards the

mathematical calculation we have

                           V /= 2 (D - D') .

is the E. M. F. of the battery,                              the difference of the

distances corresponding to the readings of the two Fpoles, the attracting force of

the continuous plate on the disc, Rj the radius of the disc, and R., that of the

aperture. Since, now, one division of the micrometer screw-head corresponds to a

-^^ Vdistance of
cm. we get, V -                        = -904187 (C. G. S.)

     The E. M. F. of Thomson's gravity Daniell was measiu'ed by comparing it
before and after the above experiment directly with that of the above battery

by means of Sir Wm. Thomsons Quadrant Electrometer. The E. M. F. e of the

cell was

                \« = 26-~2A9'9' = 0-034:381 (0. G. S.) electrostatic imits.

     (B). Absolute electro-magnetic measurement of the E. M. F.
     This measurement was made by determining the strength of the current given
by the E. M. F. by means of a tangent galvanometer, and then measuring the
resistance of the circuit in the way to be described presently.
     The tangent galvanometer employed consists of a circular coil of mean radius
18-2 cm., containing 400 turns in 19 layers of insulated copper wire, the breadth
and the depth of the coil being 2 and 1-3 cm. respectively. The needle of the
galvanometer consists of a magnet only about ^ cm. long, made of bard tempered
steel wire, and suspended in the centre of the coil by a single sillr fibre. To the

needle is attached a very fine straight glass fibre, of such a length that its ends
travel round a graduated dial of radius a little less than that of the coil, thus
serving for taking readings.

     The mathematical theory show^ that in a tangent galvanometer,

the coil, b half the breadth of the coil in tlie plane at right angles to the plane of

the coil, d half the depth of the coil in its plane, q the number of layers in the coil.

EIf be the E. M. F. producing the current c in a circuit of resistance R, then by

Ohm's law and fi-om the preceding equation we get

    The formula (2) shows that in order to measure an E. M. F. in absolute
electro-magnetic units we have to determine, (a) the deflection a, {b) the resistance

R, and (c) the horizontal component of earth-magnetism H.

     (ff) To determine a. The formula (2) also shows that whatever be the value

R R Eof the product tan a is a constant quantity as long as is kept constant,

R"W^hicb furnishes this important suggestion that by varying the resistance we

Rvary a aud lluis get many values, very nearly equal, if uot equal, of the product

   tan a, the mean of wliicli would be the more accurate value of the product. The

determination of a therefore was performed as follows. The current from the
gravity cell was passed through the tangent galvanometer (/ and a variable re-

sistance r, and the deflection a was noted. The object of introducing the variable

resistance is (1) to enable us to alter the resistance R, and (2) to obtain the

deflection giving minimum error, which is 45°.

     (b) To determine 'R{= r/ + b + r). The resistance ff of the galvanometer was
measured by Wheatstone's bridge-method, aud was equal to 30-86 ohms. The

resistance b of the battery was measured by measuring the deflections produced
Wm.on the scale of Sir
                                                                     Thomson's Quadrant Electrometer by connecting the
--electrodes of the cell to those of the electrometer first when the cell was unshunted ·

and, secondly, when it was shunted by a known resistance ; the resistance b in

this case is equal to the product of the dift'erenee of the two readings into the shunt

divided by the second reading. It was exactly equal to 2-02 ohms. So that we have

     It must, however, be remembered that in all these measurements the ohm,
or B.A. unit of resistance, is assumed to be exactly 10' C. G. S. units, which is
unfortunately doubtful, as was well remarked by Professor Adams, the President
of this Section, in his address.

     (c) To determine H. The metliod of determining this element consisted in (1)
observing the period of vibration of a magnet under II ; and (2), observing the
deflection of a magnetometer placed in the magnetic meridian by the action ol" the
magnet placed at a fixed distance in a line at right angles to the magnetic meridian
and passing through the centre of the magnetometer. "l made the experiment with
twodiftereut magnets made out of very hard tempered steel wire about 0-97 cm.
in diameter, and also experimented with each magnet by varying the distance of

Hthe magnet, and found the results to agree very closely with one another. The

mean value of obtained with one magnet is -15955, and the mean value obtained
with the other is -15937, so that the mean of these two is

                                H = -16947

   HThe formula used in the calculation of is

                                                         H

Hwhere t is period of vibration of magnet under ; k distance of the centre of the

magnet from the magnetometer ; I half the length of magnet ; i the moment of
inertia of the magnet ; (j) the angle of deflection of the magnetometer.

   We have now come to the evaluation of ' v.' The formula (II.) gives

                                                         e = 1-01172 X lOs (0. G. S.) electro-magnetic units.

Hence

                                                         V = 294-4 X 10^ centimetres per second,

Wm.which agrees well with the latest value obtained by Sir                                        Thomson,                        namelvJ,}

Although I took as much care as possible in making all the above measurements

leading to this evaluation of ' r,' yet since, from want oi time, it was only on one

occasion that I was able to make the complete measurements, there may have

been some cause or causes of error unnoticed. I intend, therefore, to repeat the

whole experiment, and hope to be able to make a further communication.

  --In conclusion, I must say-- and I say with exireme gratitude that if the

experiment be in any way satisfactory, it "is chiefly due to the very able and kind

     lie I'Observatoire de Meudon.

Les etudes que je poursuis a Meudon sur Fapplication de la pliotographie a

I'etude de la constitution du soleil, m'ont conduit k t^tendre nos connaissances sur

les transformations de I'image pbotographique par Faction seule de la luniiere.

On avait dejareconuu depuis longtenips que I'image photographique pouvait etre

renvers^e, soit par I'effet de certains r(5actifs, soit par Taction simultan^e ou succes-

MM.sive de lumieres de rt5fraugibilit6 diffe rentes.                                      Draper, 0'= Abney, Vogel,

notamment out accompli, dans cette direction, de remarquables travaux. Tout

dernierement on reconnut en Allemagne que la seule prolongation d'action de la

lumiere pouvait amener I'inversion de I'image pour des plaques au g61atino-bromure

ou au tannin.

    De notre cote, a Meudon, nous obtenions, en juin dernier, des images positives
du soleil sur plaques au g^latino-bromure, au tannin, etc., par la seide action pro-
long^e de la lumiere meme qui donne I'image. Mais bientot ce premier r(5sultat

fut compete, et nous avons et^ conduit a reconnaitre que la seule action prolong^e,
ou suffisamment intense, de la lumiere, amene six phases successives et bien

distinctes dans I'^tat de la plaque photographique.

     1° La phase de niSgativite, c'est la phase de I'image ordinaire.
    2° La premiere phase de neutralite. Dans cette phase, I'image negative a

disparu ; la plaque est presque uniformement obscure.

    3° La phase de positivit^. Pendant cette phase, I'image negative a et6 reni-

placee par une image exactement inverse, c'est-a-dire positive. Cette phase est

beaucoup plus longue que la phase negative qui precede.

   A4° cette phase succede une nouvelle phase de neutrality, mais qui diflere de

la premiere en ce que la plaque de^ient ici uniformement claire au d^veloppement,

au lieu d'etre obsciu'e.
     5° L'action lumineuse continuant, une nouvelle image negative apparait, image

que nous nommous du second ordre, pour la distinguer de la premiere image

negative qui s'est form^e sur la plaque. Cette phase est encore beaucoup plus longue

que la positive prt5cddente.
      6° Enfin, Taction lumineuse se prolongeant toujours, cette iipage disparait a

son tour, et la plaque devient, apres developpemeut, presque uniformement obscure.

C'est la phase d'obscurite du second ordre.

  10. On Improvements in Electro-Motors} By Theodor Wiesendanger.

  --1. The inventors of the most recent electro-motive engines have worked

perhaps unconscioush' upon the idea, that the construction and action of electro-
motors are based altogether upon the same laws as those of dynamo and magneto-
machines and in accordance with that assumption the field-magnets of the Desprez-
Motor are made to consist of large and heavy masses of magnetised steel.

     2. Experimenters have also for a long time past clung to the idea that the
efficiency of an electro-motor, or the amount of energy to be obtained from such
a machine, by means of a current of given strength circulating in the coils of its
armature only, bears a definite and direct proportion to the magneto-inductive
power of its field-magnets, and that an increase of power in the field-magnets
alone must necessarily produce greater capabilities of the machine.

      3. This, however, is a mischievous theory, because erroueous in its very
principles, and its development would only lead to the hypothesis of perpetual

motion. On the contrary, starting from a consideration of the facts that a very
small magnetic needle, if acted upon by one of the poles of another and very

powerful magnet, has its polarity destroyed or reversed, and that, if one of its

Npoles, say the pole, is presented to a similar (N) pole of the large magnet, the

former will completely lose its characteristic qualities and be attracted by its over-

powering opponent, we can only come to the one rational conclusion, that the

power of the field-magnets of an electro-motor, as compared with that of the magnet
or magnets constituting its armature, should not surpass the limit of some certain
ratio, yet to be determined by experiments carefully conducted, and that, if it sur-
passes that limit, the capabilities of the machine must be impaired. Acting on
this principle the inventor constructed a motor (the motor was shown in motion) in
which the power of the field-magnets is as nearly as possible equal to that of the
armature, the core of the former being very light and made entirely of soft iron;
and the satisfactory' results obtained from this machine are a sure sign that a
farther investigation of the subject, and experiments made with a view of deter-
mining the exact ratio, will lead to further improvement. Another verj' important
consideration in the construction of electro-motors is the method of motion of
the revolving armature, with regard to the approach to, or the receding of its
poles from the poles of the field magnets. The greatest amount of power will
be derived from a motor if attention is paid, not merely to the one condition
that the armature should revohe in the most highly concentrated magnetic

field possible, but also to the other, of no less moment, that nearly the entire
motion of the revolvin<^ armature should be either one of approach to or of
withdrawal from the poles of the field-magnets. [Various methods of accom-
phshing this object were described and illustrated by drawing models.] Electro-
motive engines with field-magnets of more than two poles are more perfect
in their action than others with field-magnets of two poles only, mainlj' be-
cause in the former the line of attraction, as exercised between the two sj'stems
of poles is at angles varying from 80 to 1 degrees from the motion of the poles
of the armature, whUe in the latter the line of attraction very nearly coincides
with the line of motion. The relative positions to each other of the axes of the
systems of field-magnets and the magnets constituting the armature, and the ratio
of power of the two systems, are both matters awaiting careful investigation from
men of science, and further researches in this most important and interesting field
of work must lead to immediate progress. With regard to the former question

we have as j'et only the vague, unsatisfactory hypothesis of ' fines of force,' and

the latter point appears to have escaped altogether the notice of both inventors
and investigators.

3. On the Influence of Water on the Union of Carlonic Oxide ivith Oxygen
         at High Temperatures. By Haeoi-d B. Dixon, M.A., F.C.S.

    When a spark from a Leyden jar is passed through a mixture of two volumes

of carbonic oxide and one volume'of oxygen, which has heen thorouglily dried, no
explosion is caused. It is very difficult to dry the gases thoroughly enough to
prevent the explosion under atmospheric pressure ; but by a reduction of pressure
it is easy to show that a mixture of dry gases will not explode under the influ-

ence of the spark, which mixture readily explodes on addition of a minute trace of
moisture. It was found that, when the pressure in a dried eudiometer was gra-

dually increased until the passage of the sparlc caused the gases to combine, the

disc of flame passed quite slowly down the tube, whereas when the tube was satu-
rated with moisture the flame travelled too quickly to be followed by the eye.
Some of the mixture sealed up in a glass tube with anhydrous phosphoric acid

under atmospheric pressure, would not explode on passing a succession of sparks

through it. On opening the sealed end under water, the spark caused the gases to

unite. Into a similar tube containing anhydrous phosphoric acid, a piece of potash

was fused to the glass ; when filled with the mixture and sealed up, the gases
would not combine on passing the spark. On gently lieating the potash wfth a

Bun.sen flame, the spark caused an explosion.

     It was found that a small admixture of dry carbonic acid with the gases
had no effect in determining the explosion. Neither dry nitrogen nor dry cyanogen

had any effect, while the smallest admixture of hydrogen or ether vapour caused

the gases to explode on passing a spark. From these experiments it appears

probable that the oxidation of carbonic oxide is really caused by the alternate re-

duction and oxidation of water molecules, according to the equations:

up(1) CO +  = CO., + II.,

(2) 2H,, + 0., = 2H.,0.

A comparatively small number of water molecules suffices to determine the explo-

sion ; but the explosion gains in intensity the greater the nmnber of water molecules

present. It was shown by experiments at 52° C. that the force of the explosion was

greater wlien the number of water molecules was equal to the number of carbonic
oxide molecules, than when a fewer number of water molecules were present, and
their place taken by molecules of nitrogen, whose specitic heat is less than half that

of steam.

4. On Metallic Compounds containing Divalent Organic Badicah. Part I.
                                       By J. Sakurai.i

    With the view of isolating metallic combinations of olefiant gas, Wanklyn and
"Von Than ('Jour. Chem. Soc' xii. 258) studied the action of mercury and zinc upon

ethylene iodide                                                            but they failed in obtainmg even  a       trace  of  organometaUic  com-
                                                                        ;

pounds. I repeated their experiments not only with iodide and chloride of ethylene,

but also with the bromide and the chloriodide, and under various conditions'; but

the results obtained are essentially the same as those descrited by the above-named

chemists.                                      Olefiant gas                    is  given  off  in    abundance, and  metallic   chloride, bromide,

or iodide is formed at the same time.

At the suggestion of Professor "Williamson, methylene iodide was next tried

for it appeared probable that with this compound tlie" decomposition into metallic

iodide on the one hand, and into the hydrocarbon on the other, would be impos-

sible, or, at any rate, would not take place under such circumstances as those which,

while easily allowing the ethylene compound to decompose, are, at the same time,

favourable for, or essential to, the formation of organometaUic compounds.

This anticipation was realised. By lea%-ing methylene iodide in contact with

metallic mercury and some mercurous iodide for a" few days, combination takes

place ^^-ithout any evolution of gas. One point of interest in" the reaction consists

in the part played by tlie mercurous iodide. This, under tlie influence of light,

decomposes into metaUie mercury and mercuric iodide: the former enters into

combination with metliylene iodidA ; and the latter, taking up fresh mercury, repro-

duces mercurous iodide ready for decomposition.

     Chiefly two products are formed. One of these, wlien properlv purified, is a

white crystalline substance, iusoluble in water, cold alcohol, ether, chloroform,

ethylic iodide, or benzene. It is somewliat soluble in Ijoiling alcohol, from which

it crystallises out, on cooling, in white slender needles. But by far the best solvent

for it is methylene iodide, whicli, when hot, takes up a considerable quantity of the

substance, and allows a part of it to crystalUse out on cooling. From the" mother

liquor, ether precipitates it almost completely in tlie form of fine crystals. The

substance melts at 108° to 109° C. to a clear yellow liquid, in which state it remains

up to a considerably higher temperature. On cooling, it solidifies to a yellow

crystalline mass, and re-melts at tlie original temperature.

The following numliers were obtained on analysis :

I. 0-2075 gr. of the substance gave 0-1030 sv. of mercuric sulphide,

II. 0-0910                                                                 ,,             ,, 0-0455 \,

Heated with iodine, the substance is decomposed into mercuric and methylene

iodide. Quantitative determinations show that for every 100 parts by weight of

the substance, 54-54 parts by weight of iodine are needed ; that is, as much iodine

as is contained in 100 parts of the substance. Now, if the compound contams in

its molecule nothing but a molecule of methylene iodide and an atom of mercm-y,

it ought to require, as_ it does, for the completion of the reaction, i.e. for the pro-

duction of methylene iodide and mercuric iodide, just as much iodine as it contains,

     The simplest, and indeed the most reasonable, constitutional fonmila that can
be assigned to this new body, which may be termed monomercuric methylene iodide,
is I(CH.2)"HgI, the divalent radical methylene (CHo)", combining to the extent of
half of its power with iodine on the one hand, and to the same extent on the other,
with Hgl, which plays the part of a mouatomic radical. The novelty of the com-
pound is revealed in the fact just stated, inasmuch as all the so-called organo-
metallic bodies hitherto known are characterised by the monatomic nature of the
alcohol radicals which tliey contain, viz. methyl, ethyl, amj'l, and allyl.

     It has already been stated that two products are formed by the action of mer-
cury upon methylene iodide. This second compound has not yet been obtained in
the pure state. It was, however, analj'sed ; and from the results, as well as from
some of its reactions, there is reason to believe that this body is dimercuric methylene

iodide, CH,(HgI)o.
     The action of zinc, as well as of sodium amalgam in presence of acetic ether,

upon methylene iodide were tried, and tlie results of these experiments will be the
subject of a future paper. If the zinc compound be successfully isolated, it cannot
fail to be of great service in building up bodies of the homologous series, where

the consecutive members differ by CH,,, and we may thus be able to synthesise

higher alcohols by a comparatively simple process.

5. On the Applicoilon of Organic Acids io the Examination of Minerals.
                  By Professor H. Caerington Bolton, Ph.D.

The following research into the behaviour of the commoner minerals with or-

ganic acids was prompted by the dithculty of transporting the liquid mineral acids

Aon mineralogical and geological journeys.  careful study of the action of citric

acid on 200 mineral species has established the fact that this organic acid possesses

a power of decomposing minerals only slightly less than that of hydrochloric acid.

     The manner of conducting the investigation was briefly as follows : the mineral
to be examined was very finely pulverised, and treated in a test-tube with a satu-

rated solution of tlie organic acid in the cold, and then the contents were heated

to boiling. Preference is given to citric acid, because it appeai-s to have greater

decomposing power than either tartaric or oxalic, owing probably to the greater

solubility of metallic citrates.

In order to increase the power of the organic acid, two other reagents have

been employed in connexion with it; these are sodium nitrate and potassium

iodide. These are added, in solid form, to saturated solutions of the citric acid at

the moment of using.

     Minerals belonging to several groups were submitted to these processes, and

gave phenomena which may be summarised as follows:

1st. More or less complete decomposition and solution of oxides, phosphates, &c.,

without formation of precipitates or liberation of gases.

2nd. Complete solution of carbonates, with liberation of carbonic anhydride.

3rd. Decomposition of certain sulphides with evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen.

4th. Decomposition of certain sulphides, with oxidation of the sulphur.
5th. More or less perfect decomposition of silicates, with separation of either

slimy or gelatinous silica.

6th. Decomposition of certahi species by reagents forming characteristic pre-

cipitates.

7th. Wholly negative action.

The exact lieha^iour of each species is shown in the annexed table.
The application of this method of examining minerals to field work is obvious

and this newly developed power of organic acids has undoubtedly an important

bearing on the chemistry of geological changes. The quiet work of the organic

acids of the soil in decomposing rocks and minerals demands greater recognition

than is usually accorded.

                          FRIDAY, AUGUST 27.

   The President delivered the following Address :

   Some of my predecessors in this Chair, whose duties as teachers of chemistry lead

   them to traverse a wide range of the subject every year, have appropriately and
   usefully presented to the Section a resume of the then recent progress in the mani-

   fold branches of the science which have now such far-reaching ramifications. Such
   a course has, however, come to be of much less importance and interest of late years,

   since the systematic publication by the Chemical Society of abstracts of chemical

   papers in liome and foreign journals as soon as possible after their appearance.
   Some, on the other hand, have confined attention to a department with which

   their own inquiries have more specially connected them. And, when the Council

   of the Association request a specialist like m5'self to undertake the. Presidency of

   the Section, it is to be supposed they take it for granted that he wiU select for his
   opening address some branch of the subject with which he is known to be mainly

   associated.

       But it seems to me that there is a special reason why I should bring the subject

   of Agricultural Chemistry before you on the present occasion. Not only is the

   application of chemistry to agriculture included in the title of this Section ; but in
   18ii7 the Committee of the Section requested the late Baron Liebig to prepare a

   report upon the then condition of Organic Chemistrj', and it is now exactly forty

   years since Liebig presented to the British Association the first part of his report,

   which was entitled ' Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physi-
   ology ; ' and the second part was presented two years later, in 1842, under the title
   of ' AnimalChemistry, or Organic Chemistry in its application to Physiology and
   Pathology.'. Yet, so far as I am aware, no President of the Section has, from that
   time to the present, taken as the subject of his address the Application of Chemistry

   to Agi'icidture.

       Appropriate as, for these reasons, it would seem that I, who have devoted a very

   large portion of the interval since the publication of Liebig's works, above referred

   to, to agricultural inquiries, should occupy the short time that can be devoted to
   such a purpose in attempting to note progress on that important subject, it will be

   readily understood that it would be quite impossible to condense into the limits of

   an hour's discourse anything approaching to an adequate account, either of the
   progress made during the last forty years, or of the existing condition of agricultural

   chemistry.

        For what is agricultural chemistry ? It is the chemistry of the atmosphere ;
   the chemistry of the soil ; the chemistry of vegetation ; and the chemistry of

   animal life and growth. And but a very imperfect indication of the amount of

   labour which has been devoted of recent years to the investigation of these various
   branches of what might at first sight seem a limited subject will sufiice to convince
   you how hopeless a task it would be to seek to do more than direct attention to a
   few points of special interest. Indeed, devoting to the purpose such leisure as I have
   been able to command, the more I have attempted to become acquainted with the
   vast literature which has been accumulated on the subject, the more difficulty have
   I felt in making a selection of illustrations which should not convey an idea of the

   limits, rather than of the extent, of the labour which has been expended, and of the
   results which have been attained, in agricultural research.

        The works of Liebig to which I have referred have, as you all know, been the

   subject of a very great deal of controversy. Agricultural chemists, vegetable

   physiologists, and animal physiologists have each vehemently opposed some of the

   conclusions of the author, bearing upon their respective branches. But if the part

   mywhich has fallen to  own lot in these discussions qualifies me at all to speak for

   others as well as myself, I would say that those who, having themselves carefully

   investigated the points in question, have the most prominently dissented from anj'

--special views put forward in those -works, will whether they be agricultural
--chemists, vegetable physiologists, or animal physiologists be the first to admit

how vast has been the stimulus, and how important has been the direction, given

to research in their own department, by the masterly review of then existing

knowledge, and the bold, and frequently sagacious, generalisations of one of the

most remarkable men of his time !

Confining attention to researches bearing upon agriculture, it will be well,

before attempting to indicate either the position established by Liebig's first works,

or the direction of the progress since made, to refer very briefly to the early history

of the subject.

    From what we now know of the composition and of the sources of the con-

stituents of plants, it is obvious that a knowledge of the composition of the atmo-

sphere and of water was essential to any ti-ue conception of the main features

of the vegetative process ; and it is of interest to observe that it was almost simul-

taneously with the establishment, towards the end of the last century, of definite

knowledge as to the composition of the air and of water, that their mutual rela-

tions with vegetation were first pointed out. To the collective labours of Black,

Scheele, Priestley, Lavoisier, Cavendish, and Watt, we owe the knowledge that
common air consists chiefly of nitrogen and oxygen, with a little carbonic acid

that carbonic acid is composed of carbon and oxygen ; and that water is composed

of hydrogen  and oxygen                                                whilst  Priestley and  Ingenhousz, Sennebier and Wood-
                                                                    ;

house, investigated the mutual relations of these bodies and vegetable growth.

Priestley observed that plants possessed the faculty of purifying air vitiated by

combustion or by the respiration of animals ; and, he having discovered oxygen,
it was found that the gaseous bubbles which Bonnet had shown to be emitted

from the surface of leaves plunged in water consisted principally of that gas. In-

genhousz demonstrated that the action of light was essential to the development of
these phenomena ; and Sennebier proved that the oxygen emitted resulted from

the decomposition of the carbonic acid taken up.

So far, however, attention seems to have been directed more prominently to

the question of the influence of plants upon the media with which they were sur-

rounded, than to that of the influence of those media in contributing to the in-

creased substance of the plants themselves. Towards the end of the last century,

.and in the beginning of the present one, Tie Saussure followed up these inquiries
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and in his work entitled, ' Recherches Chimiques snr la Vegetation,' published in
1804, he may be said to have indicated, if not indeed established, some of the most

important facts with which we are yet acquainted regarding the sources of the

constituents stored up by the growing plant. De Saussure illustrated experi-

mentally, and even to some extent quantitatively, the fact that in sun-light plants

increase in carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, at the expense of carbonic acid and of

water ; and in the case of his main experiment on the point, he found the increase

in carbon, and in the elements of water, to be very closely in the proportion in

which these are known to exist in the carbohydrates. He further maintained the

«ssentialness of the mineral or ash constituents of plants ; he pointed out that they
must be derived from the soil ; and he called attention to the probability that the

incombustible constituents so derived by plants from the soil were the source of

those found in the animals fed upon them.

With regard to the nitrogen which plants had already been shown to contain,

Priestley and Ingenhousz thought their experiments indicated that they absorbed

free nitrogen from the atmosphere ; but Sennebier and Woodhouse arrived at an
opposite conclusion. De Saussure, again, thought that his experiments showed

rather an evolution of nitrogen at the expense of the substance of the plant than

any assimilation of it from gaseous media. He further concluded that the source

of the nitrogen of plants was more probably the nitrogenous compounds in the soil,

and the small amoimt of ammonia which he demonstrated to exist in the atmo-

sphere.

    Upon the whole, De Saussure concluded that air and water contributed a
much larger proportion of the dry substance of plants than did the soils in which

they grew. In his view a fertile soil was one which yielded liberally to the plant

nitroo-euous compounds, and the incombustible or mineral constituents ; whilst the

carbo^, hydrogen, and oxygen, of which the greater proportion of the dry substance
of the plant was made up, were at least mainly derived from the air and water.

Perhaps I ought not to omit to mention here that, each year for ten successive

years, from ISOS^to 1812, Sir Humphry Davy delivered a course of lectures on the

' Elements of Agricultural Ohemistrv,' which were first published in 1813, were

finally revised by the author for the "fourth edition in 1827. but have gone through

several editions since. In those lectures, Sir Humphry Davy parsed in review

and correlated the then existing laiowledge, both practical and scientific, bearing

upon agriculture.  He      treated  of  the  influences  of heat  and  light                      of  the  organisa-
                                                                                               ;

their  different  parts ;  of the sources, composition, and       treatment                       of soils                                                  of  the

composition of the atmosphere, and its influence on vegetation ; of the composition

and the action of manures ; of fermentation and putrefaction ; and finally of the

principles involved in various recognised agricultural practices.

    AVith the exception of these discourses of Sir Humphry Davy, the subject

seems to have received comparatively little attention, nor was any important addi-

tion made to our knowledge in regard to it, during the period of about thirty years,
from the date of the appearance of De Saussure's work in 1804 to that of the com-

mencement of Boussingault's investigations.^

     About 1834, Boussingault became, by marriage, joint proprietor with his
brother-in-law of the estate of Bechelbronn, in Alsace. His brother-in-law, M.

Lebel, was both a chemical manufacturer and an intelligent practical farmer,
accustomed to use the balance for the weighing of manures, crops, and cattle.

Boussingault seems to have applied himself at once to chemico-agricultural

research ; and it was under these conditions of the association of ' practice with
science ' that the hrst laboratory on a farm was established.

From this time forward, Boussingault generally spent about half the year in

Paris, and the other half in Alsace ; and he has continued his scientific labours,
sometimes in the city, and .sometimes in the country, up to the present time. His

hrst important contribution to agricultural chemistry was made in 1836, when he

published a paper on the amount of nitrogen in different foods, and on the equiva-

lence of the  foods, founded  on        the  amounts  of nitrogen      they contained                                                                       and  he
                                                                                                                                                         ;

compared the results so arrived at with the estimates of others founded on actual

experience. Although his conclusions on the subject have doubtless undergone

modification since that time, the work itself marked a great advance on previously

existing knowledge, and modes of viewing the question.

In 1837, Boussingault published papers--on the amount of gluten in different

kinds of wheat ; on the influence of the clearing of forests on the diminution of the

flow of rivers ; and on the meteorological influences affecting the culture of the vine.

In 1838 he published the results of an elaborate research on the principles under-

lying the value of a rotation of crops. He determined by analysis the composition,

both organic and inorganic, of the manures applied to the land, and of the crops

harvested. In his treatment of the subject he evinced a clear perception of the

most important problems involved in such an inquiry ; some of which, with the

united labours of himself and many other workers, have scarcely yet received an

undisputed solutiou.

     Thus, in the same year (1838), he published the results of an investigation on

the question whether^ plants assimilate the free or uncombined nitrogen of the

atmosphere; and although the analytical methods of the day were inadequate to
the decisive settlement of the point," his conclusions were in the main those which

much subsequent work of his own, and much of others also, has served to confirm.
    As a further element of the question of the chemical statistics of a rotation of

crops, Boussingault determined the amount and composition of the residues of
various crops ;''also the amount of constituents consumed in the food of a cow and

    ' Some reference should have been made in the text to the labours and writings
of Dr. Carl Sprenj^cl, late Professor of Agriculture at Brunswick, who made numerous
analyses of agricultural materials, and published numerous papers in connection with

Agricultural Chemistry, during a series of years, commencing about 1826.

of a liorse respectively, aud yielded iu the milk and excretions of the cow, and in

the excretions of the horse. Here, again, the exigencies of the investigation he

undertook were beyond the reach of the kno^\'n methods of the time. Indeed, rude

as the art of agriculture is generally considered to be, the scientific elucidation of

its practices requires the most  refined, and  very varied, methods  of  research                                    and
                                                                                                                  ;

a characteristic of the work of Boussingault may be said to be, that he has fre-

quently had to devise methods suitable to his piu'pose, before he could grapple with

the problems before him.

     In 1839, chiefly in recognition of his important contributions to agricidtural

chemistry, Boussingault was elected a member of the Institute ; and in 1878,

thirt3'-nine years later, the Council of the Royal Society awarded to him the

Copley Medal, the highest honour at their disposal, for his numerous and varied

contributions to science, but especially for those relating to agriculture.

The foregoing brief historical sketch is sufficient to indicate, though but in broad

outline, the range of existing knowledge on the subject of agricultural chemistry

prior to the appearance of Liebig's memorable work in 1840. It will be seen that

some ^ery important and indeed fundamental facts had already been established iu

regard to vegetation, and that Boussingault had not only extended inquiry on that

subject, but he had brought his own and previous results to bear upon the elucida-

tion of long-recognised agricultural practices. There can be no doubt that the data

supplied by his researches contributed important elements to the basis of established

facts upon which Liebig founded his brilliant generalisations. Accordingly, in

1841, Dumas and Boussingault published, jointly, an essay which afterwards

appeared in English under the title of ' The Chemical and Physiological Balance of

Organic Nature ; ' and, in 1843, Boussingault published a larger work, which
embodied the results of many of his own previous original investigations.

But there can be no doubt that the appearance of Liebig's two works, which

were contributions made in answer to a request submitted to him by the committee

of this Section of the British Association, constituted a very marked epoch in the

history of the progress of agricultural chemistry. In the treatment of his subject

he not only called to his aid the previously existing knowledge directly bearing

upon it, but he also turned to good account the more recent triumphs of organic
chemistry, many of which had been won iu his own laboratory. Further, a marked

feature of his expositions was the adoption of what may be called the statistical

--method I use the word statistical rather than quantitative, as the latter expression

has its own technical meaning among chemists, which is not precisely what I wish

to convey.

      It seems that, notwithstanding the conclusive evidence afforded b)' the direct

experiments of De Sausaure and his predecessors, vegetable physiologists continued

to hold the view that the humus of the soil was the source of the carbon of vege-

tation. Not only did Liebig give full weight to the evidence of the experiments of

De Saussure and others, and illustrate the possible or probable transformations

within the plant by facts already established in organic chemistry, but he demon-

strated the utter impossibility of humus supplying the amount of carbon assimilated

over a given area. He pointed out that humus itself was the product of previous

vegetable growth, and that it could not therefore be an original source of carbon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and that, from the degree of its insolubility, either in pure water or in water con-

taining alkaline or earthy bases, only a small portion of the carbon assimilated by

plants could be derived from the amount of humus that could possibly enter the

plant in solution. He maintained that, so far as humus was beneficial to vegeta-

tion at all, it was only by its oxidation, and a consequent supply of carbonic acid

within the soil ; a source which he considered only of importance in the early stages
of the life of a plant, and before it had developed and exposed a sufficient amount

of green surface to the atmosphere to render it independent of soil supplies of

carbonic acid.

    With regard to the hydrogen of plants, at any rate that portion of it contained

in their non-nitrogenous products, he maintained that its source must be water

and that the source of the oxygen was either that contained in carbonic acid or

that in water.

                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.   511

     With regard to the nitrogen of vegetation, both from the known characters of

free nitrogen, and as he considered a legitimate deduction from direct experiments,
he aro-ued that pLants did not take up free or uncomhined nitrogen, either from the
atmosphere, or dissolved in water and so absorbed by the roots. The source of the
nitroi^en of vegetation was, he maintained, ammonia ; the product of the putrefaction

of one generation of plants and animals aflbrding a supply for its successors. He

pointed out that, in the case of a farm receiving nothing from external som-ces, and
selling off certain products, the amount of nitrogen in the manure derived by the con-

sumption of some of the vegetable produce on the farm itself, together with that due
to the refuse of the crops, must always be less than was contained in the crops
o-rown ; and he concluded that though the quantity so returned to the land was

important, a main source of the nitrogen assimilated over a given area was that

brought down from the atmosphere in rain.
     There can be no doubt that, owing to the limited and defective experimental

evidence then at command ou the point, Liebig at that time (as he has since)
o-reatly over-estimated the amount of ammonia available to vegetation from that
soiu'ce. In Boussiugault's reclnmation already referred to, he gave much more

prominence to the importance of the nitrogen of manures. In Liebig's next edition

(in 1843) he combated the notion of the relative importance of the nitrogen of
manures ; maintained, in opposition to the view put forward in his former edition,
that the atmosphere afforded a sufficient supply of nitrogen for cultivated as well as
for uncultivated plants ; that the supply was sufficient for the cereals as well as for
len-uminous plants ; that it was not necessary to supply nitrogen to the former

and he insisted very much more strongly than formerly on the relative importance

of the supply of the incombustible, or, as he designated them, the ' inorganic ' or

'mineral,' constituents.

As to the incombustible or mineral constituents themselves, Liebig adduced

Hemany illustrations in proof of their essentialness.  called attention to the

variation in the composition of the ash of plants grown on ditfereut soils ; and he

assumed a greater degree of mutual replaceability of one base by another, or of one

acid by another, than could be now admitted. He traced the difference in the

mineral composition of different soils to that of the rocks which had been their

source ; and he seems to have been led by the consideration of the gradual action

of ' wetttJieri7if/,' in rendering available the otherwise locked-up stores, to attribute

the beneiits of fallow exclusively to the increased supply of the incombustible

constituents which would, by its agency, be brought into a condition in which they

could be taken up by plants.
     The benefits of an alternation of crops Liebig considered to be in part explained

by the influence of the excreted matters from one description of crop upon the

o-rowth of another. He did not attach weight to the assumption that such matters

would be directly injurious to the same description of crop ; but he supposed rather
that the matters excreted were those which the plant did not need, and would
therefore be of no avail to the same description of plant, but would be of use to
another. He, however, attributed much of the benefits of a rotation to different

mineral constituents being required from the soil by the respective crops.

     Treating of manure, he laid the greatest stress on the return b}' it of the potass
and the phosphates removed by the crops. But he also insisted on the importance

of the nitrogen, especially that in the liquid excretions of animals, and condemned
the methods of treatment of animal manures by which the ammonia was allowed

to be lost by evaporation. It is curious and significant, however, that some of the
passages in his first edition, in which he the most forcibly urges the value of the
nitrogen of animal manures, are omitted in the third and fourth editions.

The discussion of the processes of fermentation, decay, and putrefaction, and

that of jwisons, contagions, and miasms, constituted a remarkable and important
part of Liebig's first report. It was the portion relating to poisons, contagions,

and miasms that he presented to this Section as an instalment, at the meeting of
the Association held at Glasgow in 1840. It was in the chapters relating to the
several subjects here enumerated that he developed so prominently his views on

the influence of contact in inducing chemical changes. He cited many known
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

transformations, other than those coming under either of the heads iu question, in

illustration of his subject ; and he discussed with great clearness the ditterent con-

--ditions occurring, and the different results obtained, in various processes such as

the diiferent modes of fermenting beer, the fermentation of wme from different

kinds of grapes, the production of acetic acid, &c. As is well known, he claimed
a purely chemical explanation for the phenomena involved in fermentation. He

further maintained that the action of contagions was precisely similar. In his latest

writings on the subject (in 1870), he admits some change of view: but it is by no

means easy to decide exactly how much or how little of modification he would wish

to imply.
     Liebig's second report, presented at the meeting of this Association in 1842,

and published under the title of ' Animal Chemistry, or Organic Chemistry in its
applications to Physiology and Pathology,' perhaps excited even more attention than
his first, and, probably fi-om the manner as much as from the matter, aroused a great
deal of controversy, especially among physiologists and physicians. Liebig was
severe upon what he considered to be a too exclusive attention to morphological
charactei-s in physiological research, and at any rate too little attention to chemical

phenomena, and, so far as these were investigated, an inadequate treatment of the

subject according to strictly quantitative methods.

    He combated the view that nervous action, as such, could be a source of any

of the heat of the body ; and he adduced numerous illustrations and calculations

in support of the view that the combustion of carbon and h^-drogen in the system
was sufficient to account for, and was the only source of, animal heat.

    He compared and contrasted the general composition of plants and animals.

In accordance with Mulder, he pointed out that whilst plants formed the nitro-

genous bodies which they contain from carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, animals
did not produce them, but received them readj'-formed in their vegetable food
that, in fact, the animal begins only where the plant ends. But, going beyond
Mulder, and beyond what had then, or has since, been established, he maintained the

identity in composition of the admittedly analogous nitrogenous compounds in plants

and in the blood of animals.
     Omitting the fat which the carnivora might receive in the animals they con-

sumed, he stated the characteristic difference between the food of carnivora and
herbivora to be, that the former obtained the main proportion of their respiratory

material from the waste of tissue ; whilst the latter obtained a large amount from

starch, sugar, itc. These different conditions of life accoimted for the comparative

leanness of carnivora and fatness of herbivora.

    He maintained that the vegetable food consumed by herbivora did not contain

anything like the amount of fat which they stored up in their bodies ; and he
showed how nearly the composition of fat was obtained by the simple elimination
of so much oxygen, or of oxygen and a little carbonic acid, from the various carbo-
hydrates. Much less oxygen would be required to be eliminated from a quantity
of fibrine, &c., containing a given amount of carbon, than from a quantity of carbo-
hydrates containing an equal amount of carbon. The formation of fatty matter in
plants was of the same kind ; it was the result of a secondary action, starch being

first formed from carbonic acid and water.

    He concluded from the facts adduced that the food of man might be di\ided

into the nifrogenised and the non-nitrogenised elements. The former were capable of

conversion into blood, the latter incapable of such transformation . The former might
be called the p^ffs^ic elements of nuti-ition, the latter elements of resjn)-af ion. From
the plastic elements, the membranes and cellular tissue, the nerves and brain, car-

tilage, and  the  organic part  of  bones, could be formed                                                                                                             but  the  plastic  substance
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

must be received ready-made. "Whilst gelatine or chondrine was derived from

fibrine or albumen, fibrine or albumen could not be reproduced from gelatine or

chondrine. The gelatinous tissues suffer progressive alteration under the influence

of oxygen, and the materials for their re-formation must be restored from the blood.
It might, however, be a question whether gelatine taken in food might not again

be converted into cellular tissue, membrane, and cartilage, in the body.

    At that time, adopting and attaching great importance to Mulder's views in
                                                                                        ;

--regard to proteine, he says: 'AH the organic nitrogenised constituents of the

body, how different soever they may be in composition, are derived from proteine.
They are formed from it by the addition or subtraction of the elements of water
or of oxygen, and by resolution into two or more compounds.'

    He seeks to trace the changes occurring in the conversion of the constituents of

Ibod into blood, of those of blood into the various tissues, and of these into the

secretions and excretions.

    He states that the process of chymifieation takes place in virtue of a purely

chemical action, exactly similar to those processes of decomposition or transforma-

tion which are known as putrefaction, fermentation, or deca}'. Thus, the clear

gastric j uice contains a substance in a state of transformation, by the contact of
which with the insoluble constituents of the food they are rendered soluble, no

other element taking any share in the action excepting oxygen and the elements of

water. All substances which can arrest the phenomena of fermentation and putre-
faction in liquids, also arrest digestion when taken into the stomach. Putrefying

blood, white of egg, flesh, and cheese produce the same effects in a solution of

.<ugar as yeast or ferment ; the explanation being, that ferment, or yeast, is nothing

but vegetable fibrine, albumen, or caseine, in a state of decomposition.

       Referring to the derivation of the animal tissues, he says they all contain, for a
· liiven amount of carbon, more oxygen than the nitrogenous constituents of blood.

In hair and gelatinous membrane there is also an excess of nitrogen and hydrogen,

Weand in the proportions to form ammonia.  may suppose an addition of these

elements, or a subtraction of carbon, the amount of nitrogen remaining the same.

The gelatinous substance is not a compound of proteine ; it contains no sulphur, no

phosphorus ; and it contains more nitrogen, or less carbon, than proteine.

    He next, as he says, attempts to develop analytically the principal metamor-
phoses which occur in the animal body. He adds that the results have surprised
himself no less than they will others, and have excited in his own mind the same
doubts as others will conceive. He nevertheless gives them, because he is con-

vinced that the method by which they have been obtained is the only one by which

we can hope to acquire an insight into the nature of organic processes.

     Referring to the animal secretions, he argues that they must contain the pro-

ducts of the metamorphosis of the tissues. He says a starving man with severe

exertion secretes more urea than the most highly fed individual in a state of rest
and he combats the idea that the nitrogen of the food can pass into urea without

having previously become part of an organised tissue.
     Having shown the chemical relations of bile and urine to the proteine bodies,

he illustrates, by formulae, the connection between allantoiue and the constituents

of the urine of animals that respire. He insists that in the herbivora the carbo-

hydrates must take part in the formation of bile ; and he calculates the number
of equivalents of proteine, starch, oxygen, and water, which would yield a given
number of equivalents of urea, choleic acid, ammonia, and carbonic acid. The non-

nitrogenous constituents in the food of the herbivora retard the metamorphosis of

the nitrogenous bodies, rendering this less rapid than in the carnivora. It may be

--riaid that proteine, starch, and oxygen give the secretions and excretions carbonic

acid by the lungs, urea and carbonate of ammonia by the kidneys, choleic acid by
the liver. It is the study of the phenomena which accompany the metamorphoses

of the food in the organism, the discovery of the share which the atmosphere and

the elements of water take in these changes, by which we shall learn the conditions

necessary for the production of a secretion or of an organised part.

    He traces the possible formation of taurine from caffeine or asparagine by
t]ieir_ assumption of oxygen and of the elements of water. And from the com-

position of the vegetable alkaloids he suggests the possibility of their taking a
share in the formation of new, or the transformation of existing, brain and nervous

matter.

     Finally, in reference to these various illustrations and considerations, he says,

however hypothetical they may appear, they deserve attention in so far as they
point out the way which chemistry must pursue if she would really be of service

to physiology and pathology. Chemistry, he savs, relates to the conversion of food

into the various tissues and secretions, and to tlieir subsequent metamorphosis into

lifeless compounds.

After this lapse of time, it will certainly be granted that, quite irrespectively of

--the admissibility or otherwise of the particular illustrations adduced, or of .the

truth or error of any of the conclusions drawn and some at least are so true that

they seem to iis now all hut truisms, and you may be disposed to ask me why I

--should tell you over again a story so often told before there is no doubt that

Liebig's manner of treating the subject did exert an immense influence, by stimu-

lating investigation, by fixing attention on tbe points to be investigated, and on

the methods that must be followed, and thus, by leading to the establishment or

the correction of any special views he put forward, and to a vast extension of our

knowledge on the complicated questions involved.

In the third part of Liebig's second volume he treats of the phenomena of

motion in the animal organism. It is to his views in regard to one aspect only of

this very wide and very complicated subject that I propose to call your attention

here, as it is chiefly in so far as that aspect is concerned that the question is of

interest from the point of view of the agricultural chemist. He says :--

   We' observe in animals that the conversion of food into blood, and the contact

of the blood with the living tissues, are determined by a mechanical force, whose

manifestation proceeds from distinct organs, and is effected by a distinct system of

organs, possessing the property of commuuicatiug and extending the motion which

Wethey receive.      find the power of the animal to change its place and to produce

mechanical efiects by means of its limbs dependent on a second similar system of

organs or apparatus.'

    He points out that the motion of the animal fluids proceeds from distinct

organs (as, for example, that of the blood from the heart), which do not generate

the force in themselves, but receive it from other parts by means of the nerves ; the

limbs also receive their moving force in the same way. He adds : ' Where nerves

are not found, motion does not occur.' Again :

    * As an immediate effect of the manifestation of mechanical force, we see that a

part of the muscular substance loses its vital properties, its character of life ; that

this portion separates from the living part, and loses its capacity of growth and its

Wepower of resistance.  find that this change of properties is accompanied by

the entrance of a foreign body (oxygen) into the composition of the muscular

fibre. . . ; and all experience proves that this conversion of living muscidar fibre into
compounds destitute of vitality is accelerated or retarded according to the amount

of force employed to produce motion.' He adds that a rapid transformation of

muscidar fibre determines a greater amount of mechanical force, and that conversely

a greater amount of mechanical motion determines a more rapid change of matter.
     ' The change of matter, the manifestation of mechanical force, and the absorp-

tion of oxygen, are, in the animal body, so closely connected with each other that

we may consider the amount of motion and the quantity of living tissue transformed

as proportional to the quantity of oxygen inspired and consumed in a given time

by the animal.' Again:

' The production of heat and the change of matter are closely related to each

other ; but although heat can be produced in the body without any change of

matter in living tissues, yet tbe change of matter cannot be supposed to take place

--without the co-operation of oxygen.'
     Further, on the same point : ' The sum of force available for mechanical pur-
poses must be equal to the sum of the vital forces of all tissues adapted to the

change of matter. If, in equal times, unequal quantities of oxygen are consumed,

the residt is obvious in an unequal amount of heat liberated, and of mechanical

force. When unequal amounts of mechanical force are expended, this determines

the absorption of corresponding and imequal quantities of oxygen.'

Then, more definitely still, referring to the changes which take place coincidently

with the exercise of force, and to the demands of the system for repair accordingly,

he says :

     * The amount of azotised food necessary to restore the equilibrium between waste
and supply is directly proportional to the amount of tissues metamorphosed. The
----

TRAN3ACTI0JIS OF SECTION B.                    515

amount of living matter, wbich in the body loses the condition of life, is, in equal
temperatures, directly proportional to the mechanical eilects produced in a given

time. The amount of tissue metamorphosed in a given time may be measured by
the quantity of nitrogen in the urine. The sum of the mechanical eftects produced

iu tw(i individuals, in the same temperature, is proportional to the amount of nitro-
gen in their urine, whether the mechanical force has been employed in the voluntary
or involuntary motions, whether it has been consumed by the limbs, or by the heart

and other viscera.'
     Thus, apparently influenced by the physiological considerations which have been

adduced, and notwithstanding in some passages he seemed to recognise a connection
between the total quautity of oxygen inspired and consumed and the quantity of
mechanical force developed, Liebig nevertheless very prominently insisted that the

--amount of muscular tissue transformed the amount of nitrogenous substance oxi-
--dated was the measure of the force generated. He accordingly distinctly draws

the conclusion that the requirement for the azotised constituents of food will be in-
creased in proportion to the increase in the amount of force expended.

     It will be obvious that the question whether in the feeding of animals for the

-- --exercise of mechanical force that is, for their labour the demands of the system

will be proportionally the greater for an increased supply of the nitrogenous or of
the non-nitrogenous constituents of food, is one of considerable interest and prac-

tical importance. To this point I shall have to refer further on.

     So far, I have endeav'oured to convey some idea of the state of knowledge on the
subject of the chemistry of agriculture prior to the appearance of Liebig's first two
works bearing upon it, and also briefly to smnmarise the views he then enunciated
in regard to some points of chief importance. Let us next try to ascertain some-

thing of the influence of his teaching.

    Confining attention to agricultural research, it may be observed that in 1843

--that is, very soon after the appearance of the works in question the Roj^al Agri-

cultural Society of England first appointed a consulting chemist. .Vt that date

mDr. Lyon Playfair was elected ; 1848, Professor AVay ; and in 1858 Dr. Voelcker,

who continues to hold the office with much advantage to that union of ^Practice

xcith Science. ' which the Society by its motto recognises as so essential to progress
Also in 1843 there was established the Chemico-Agricultural Society of Scotland,
which was, I believe, broken up, after it had existed between four and five years,
because its able chemist, the late Professor Johnston, failed to find a remedy for the
potato disease. In 1845, the (Jhemico- Agricultural Society of Ulster was estab-
lished, and appointed as its chemist. Professor Hodges, who still ably performs
the duties of the office. Lastly, the very numerous ' Af/rtcidtural Experimental
Stations ' which have been established, uot only in Germany, but in most Conti-
nental States, owe their origin directly to the writings, the teachings, and the
influence of Liebig. The movement seems to have originated in Saxony, where
Stockliardt had already stimulated interest in the subject by his lectures and his

writings. After some correspondence, in 1850-1, between the late Dr. Crucius

and others on the one side, and the Government on the other, the first so-called

mAf/riculfural Exjierimental Station was established at Mochern, near Leipzig,

1851-2. In 1877, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of that institu-

tion was celebrated at Leipzig, when an account (which has .since been published)
was given of the number of stations then existin?, of the number of chemists engaged,
and of the subjects which had been in\'estigated. From that statistical statement
we learn that in 1877 the number of stations was :

     Besides these 122 stations on the Continent of Europe, the United States are
credited with 1, and Scotland also with 1. _

     Each of these stations is under the direction of a chemist, frequently with one
or more assistants. One special duty of most of them is what is called maiuire-
or seed- or feeding-stufi-control ; that is, to examine or analyse, and report upon
such substances in the market ; and it seems to ha-\e been found the interest of dealers

in these commodities to submit their proceedings to a certain degree of super\'ision

by the chemist of the station of their district.

    But ao-ricultural research has also been a characteristic feature of these institu-

tions. It is stated that the investigation of soils has been the prominent object

at  16  of  them                         experiments with manures at 24 ;  ^egetable physiology at 28
                                      ;

animal physiology and feeding experimt'uts at 20 ; \ine-culture and wine-making at

13- forest-culture at 0; and milk-production at 11. Others, according to their

locality, have devoted special attentiim to fruit-cidture, olive-culture, the cultivation
of moor, bog, and peat land, the production of silk, the manufacture of spirit, and

(>tlier products.

     Nor does this enumeration of the institutions established as the direct residt of
Liebio^'s influence, and of the subjects investigated rmder their auspices, complete
the list either of the workers engaged, or of the work accomplished in agricultural
research. To say nothing of the labours of Boussingault, which commenced some
vears prior to the appearance of Liebig's first work, and which are fortunately still
at the service of agriculture, important contributions have been made by the late
Professors Johnston and Anderson in Scotland, and in this country both by Mr. "Way
and Dr. Voelcker, each alike in his private capacity, and in fulfilment of his duties as
Chemist to the Roval Agricultural Society of England. Nor would it be fair to
Mr. Lawes (who commenced experimenting first with plants in pots, and afterwards

whomin the field, soon after entering into possession of his property in 1834-, and with

I lia^e mj'self lieeu associated since 1843) A\ere I to omit in this place any mention
of the investigations which ha\ebeen so man}' years in progress at Rothamsted.

     So much for the machinerj' ; but what of the results achieved by all this

activity in the application of chemistry to agriculture?

     As I have already intimated, and as the foregoing brief statistical statement
will have convinced you must be the case, it will be utterly impossible to give,

on such an occasion as this, anything approaching to an adequate review of the
progress achieved. Indeed, I have to confess that the more I have looked at the
subject with the hope of treating it comprehensively, the more I have been impelled

To substitute a very limited plan for the much more extended scheme which I had

at first hoped to be able to fill up. I propose then to confine attention to a few
.-special points, which have either some connection with one another, or to which
recent results or discussions lend some special interest.

      First as to the sources and the assimilation of the carbon, the hydrogen, and the

oxven of vegetation. From the point of view of the agricidtural chemist, the hydro-
gen and the oxygen may be left out of view. For, if the cultivator provide to the

plant the conditions for the accumulation of sufficient nitrogen and carbon, he may-
leave it to take care of itself in the matter of hydrogen and oxygen. That the hydro-
gen of the carljo-hydrates is exclusively obtained from water, is, to say the least, pro-
bable ; and whether part of their oxygen is derived from carbonic acid, and part from
water, or the whole from either of these, will not affect his agricultural practice,

      AVith regard to the carbon, the whole tendency^ of subsequent observations is to

confirm the opinion put forward by De Saussure about the commencement of the
century, and so forcibly insisted upon by Liebig forty years later- -that the greater

part, if not the whole of it, is derived from tlie carbonic acid of the atmosphere.

--Indeed, direct expenments are not wanting--those of Moll, for example from
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  517

 ·wliich it has been coucluded tliat plants do not even utilise tlie carbonic acid which

 they may take up from the soil by their roots. However this may be, we may

 safely conclude that practically the whole of the carbon which it is the object of
 the cultivator to force the plants he grows to take up is derived from the atmo-
 sphere, in which it exists in such extremely small proportion, but nevertheless lar"-e
 actual, and constantly renewed amount.

      Judging from the more recent researches on the point, it would seem probable
 that the estimate of one part of carbon, as carbonic acid, in 10,000 of air, is more
 probably too high than too low as an estimate of the average quantity in the
 ambient atmosphere of our globe. And, although this would correspond to several
 times more in the column of air resting over an acre of land than the vegetation of
 that area can annually take iip, it represents an extremely small amount at any
 one time in contact with the growing plants, and it could only suffice on the suppo-
 sition of a very rapid renewal, accomplished as the result, on the one hand of a con-
 stant return of carbonic acid to the atmosphere by combustion and the respiration
 of animals, and on the other of a constant interchange and equalisation among the

 constituents of the atmosphere.

      It_ will convey a more definite idea of what is accomplished by vegetation in the
 assimilation of carbon from the atmosphere if I give, in round numbers, the results
 of some direct experiments made at Kothamsted, instead of making general state-
 ments merely.

     In a field which has now grown wheat for thirty-seven years in succession, there

 are some plots to which not an ounce of carbon has been returned during the whole
 of that period. Yet, with purely mineral manure, an average of about 1000 pounds
of carbon is annually removed from the land ; and where a given amount of nitro-
genous manure is employed with the mineral manure, an average of about 1500 pounds
per acre per annum more is obtained ; in all an average of about 2500 pounds of
 carbon annually assimilated over an acre of land without any return of carbonaceous
manure to it.

      In a field in which barley has been grown for twenty-nine years in succession,
quite accordant results have been obtained. There, smaller amounts of nitrogenous
manure have been employed with the mineral manure than in the experiments with
wheat above cited : but the increase in ihe assimilation of carbon for a given amount
of nitrogen supplied in the manure is greater in the case of the barley than of the

wheat.

     With sugar-beet, again, larger amounts of carbon have been annually accumu-

lated without the supply of any to the soil, but under the influence of a liberal
provision of both nitrogenous and mineral manure, than by either wheat or barley.

      Lastly, with grass, still larger amounts of carbon have been annually accumu-
lated, without any supply of it by manure.

:i(:»!i Many experiments have been made, in Germany and elsewhere, to determine the

amount of the ditferent constituents taken up at different periods of the growth of
various plants. But we may refer to some made at Kothamsted long ago to illus-
trate the rapidity with which the carbon of our crops may be withdrawn from the

atmosphere.

     In 1847, we carefully took samples from a growing wheat crop at difierent stages
of its progress, commencing on June 21, and in these samples the dry matter, the
mineral matter, the nitrogen, &c., were determined. On each occasion the produce
of two separate eighths or sixteenths of an acre was cut and weighed, so that the

data were provided to calculate the amounts of the several constituents which had
been accumulated per acre at each period. The result was that, whilst during
little more than five weeks from June 21, there was comparatively little increase
in the amount of nitrogen accumulated over a given area, more than half the total
carbon of the crop was accumulated during that period.

     Niunerous experiments of a somewhat similar kind, made in another season, 1850,
concurred in showing that, whilst the carbon of the crop was more than doubled
after the middle of June, its nitrogen increased in a much less degree over the same

period.

     Similar experiments were also made, in 1854 and in 185G, with beans. The
                                                                                                                                  ;

518 KEPORT-- 1880,

general tesult was tliat a smaller proportion of both the total nitrogen and the total
carbon was accumulated bj' the middle or end of June than in the case of the wheat

tliough the actual amount of nitrogen taken up by the beans was much greater, both

before and after that date. The nitrogen of this leguminous crop increased in a
much greater proportion during the subsequent stages of growth than did that of

the  gramineous crop                                                                  but  the  carbon  increased  in  a  larger  proportion still, three-
                                                                                   ;

fourths or more of the total amount of it being accumidated after the middle of June.

     I should say that determinations of carbon, made in samples of soil taken from

the wheat field at diflerent periods during recent years, indicate some decline in the

percentage of carbon in the soils, but not such as to lead to the supposition that the

soils have contributed to the carbon of the crops. Besides the amount of carbon

annually removed, there will, of course, be a further accumidation in the stubble

and roots of the crops ; and the reduction in the total carbon of the soil, if such
have really taken place, would show tliat the annual oxidation within it is greater

than the annual gain by the residue of the crops.

     Large as is the annual accumulation of carbon from the atmosphere over a given

area in the cases cited, it is obvious that the quantity must vary exceedingly with

--variation of climatal conditions. It is, in fact, several times as great in the case of

tropical A"egetation that of the sugar-cane for example. And not only is the

greater part of the assimilation accomplished within a comparatively small portion

of the year (varying of course according to the region), but the action is limited

to the hours of dajdight, whilst duiiiig darkness there is rather loss than gain.

     But it is remarkable that whilst the accumulation of carbon, the chief gain of

solid material, takes place under the influence of light, cell-division, cell-multipli-

cation, increase in the structure of the plant, in other words, what, as distinguished

from assimilation, vegetable physiologists designate as (/rowth, takes place, at any

rate chiefly, during the night ; and is accompanied, not with the taking up of carbonic

acid and the yielding up of oxygen, but with the taking up of oxygen and the giving

up of carbonic acid. This evolution of carbonic acid during darkness must obviously

be extremely small, compared with the converse action during day-light, coinciden-

tally with which practically the whole of the accumidation of solid substance is ac-

complished. But, as tlie product of the night action is the same as in the respiration

of animals, this is distinguished by vegetable physiologists as the respiration of plants.

     I suppose I shall be considered a heretic if I venture to suggest that it seems in a

sense inappropriate to apply the term f/i-oicth to that which is associated with actual

loss of material, and that the term respiraiinn sliould be applied to so secondary an

action as that as the result of which carbonic acid is given ort' from the plant. It

may, I think, be a question whether there is any advantage in thus attem.ptiug to

establish a parallelism between animal and vegetable processes ; rather w^oidd it

seem advantageous to keep prominently in view their contrasted, or at any rate

complementary characteristics, especially in the matter of the taking up of carbonic

acid and the giving up of oxygen on the one hand, and the talcing in of oxygen

and the giving up of carbonic acid on the other.

     But it is obvious that in latitudes where there is comparatively contmuous

--daylight during the periods of a egetation, the two actions designated respecti^-ely
--assimilation and growth must go on much more simultaneously than where

tliere is a more marlced alternation of dayliglit and darkness. In parts of Norway

and Sweden, for example, where, during the summer, thei-e is almost continuous

daylight, crops of barley are grown with only from six to eight weeks intervening

from seed-time to harvest. A.nd Professor Schlibeler, of Christiania, after making

observations on the subject for nearly thirty years, has recently described the

characteristics of the vegetation developed under the influence of short summers

with almost continuous light. He states that, after acclimatisation, many gar-

den flowers increase in size and depth of colour ; that there is a prevailing tinge

of red in the plants of the fjelds ; that the aroma of fruits is increased, and their

colour well developed, but that they are deficient in sweetness ; and that the deve-

lopment of essential oils in certain plants is greater than in the same plants grovni

in other latitudes. Indeed, he considers it to be an established fact that light bears

the same relation to aroma as heat does to sweetness.

     In connection with this question of the characters of growtli under the influence

of continuous light, compared with those developed with alternate light and dark-
ness, the recent experiments of Dr. Siemens on the influence of electric light on

vegetation are of considerable interest.

     In one series of experiments, he kept one set of plants entirely in the dark, a second
he exposed to electric light only, a third to daylight only, and a fourth to daylight,
and afterwards to electric light from 5 to 11 P.M. Those kept in the dark acquired
a pale yellow colour, and died ; those exposed to electric light only, maintained a
light green colour, and survived ; those exposed to daylight were of a darker green
colour, and were more vigorous ; and, lastly, those submitted to alternate daylight
and electric light, and but a few hours of darkness, showed decidedly greater

vigour, and, as he says, the green of the leaf was of a dark rich hue. He concluded

that daylight was t^^-ice as effective as electric light ; but that, nevertheless, ' elec-
tric light was clearly sufficiently powerful to form chlorophyll and its derivatives

in the plants.'

     In a second series of experiments one group of plants was exposed to daybght

alone ; a second to electric light during eleven hours of the night, and was kept in
the dark during the day ; and a third to eleven hours day, and eleven hours electric

light.  The plants  in    daylight  showed    the usual  healthy     appearance                                              those in
                                                                                                                          ;

alternate electric light  and darkness Avere  for the    most  part  of a  lighter colour
                                                                                                                                     ;

and those in alternate daylight and electric light far surpassed Jhe others in dark-

ness of green and ^-igorous appearance generally.
     I have carefully considered these general descriptions with a view to theii"

bearing on the question whether the characters developed under the influence of

electric light, and especially those under the influence of almost continuous light,
are more prominently those of assimilation or of groA\-th ; but I have not been able

to come to a decisive opinion on the point. From some conversation I had AA-ith

Dr. Siemens on the subject, I gather that the characteristics were more those of
dark colour and vigour than of tendency to great extension in size. The dark green

colour we may suppose to indicate a liberal production of chlorophyll ; but if the

depth of colour was more than normal, it might be concluded that the chlorophyll

had not performed its due amount of assimilation work. In regard to this point,

attention may be called to the fact that Dr. Siemens refers to the abundance of the

blue or actinic rays in the electric arc, conditions which would not be supposed

specially to favou/assimilation. On the other hand, the \"igour, rather than charac-
teristic extension in size, would seem to indicate a limitation of what is technically

called growth, under the influence of tlie almost continuous light.

     Among the numerous field experiments made at Kothamsted, we have many

examples of great variation in depth of green colour of the vegetation growing on

plots side by side under knov.u diflerences as to manuring ; and we have abundant

evidence of difference of composition, and of rate of carbon-assimilation, coincidently
with these different shades of colour. One or two instances wiU strikingly illus-

trate the point under consideration.
     There are two plots side by side in the series of experiments on permanent grass

land, each of which received dm-ing six consecutive years precisely the same amount
of a mixed mineral manure, including potass, and the same amount of nitrogen in
the form of ammonia salts. After those six years, one of the two plots was still
manured in exactly the same way each year ; wliilst the other was so, with one

--t'xception namely, the potass was now excluded from the manure. Calculation

.;hows that there was a great excess of potass applied during the first six years ;

and there was no marked diminution of produce during the five or six years .suc-
ceeding the cessation of the application. But each year subsequently, up to the
present time, now a period of fourteen years, or of nineteen since the exclusion of the

potass, the falling off in produce has been very great.

     The point of special interest is, however, that all but identically the same
amount of nitrogen has been taken up by the herbage growing with the deficiency
of potass as by that with the continued supply of it. The colour of the vegetation
with the deficiency of potass has been very much darker green than that with the

full supply of it. "Nevertheless, taking the average of the eight years succeeding.:
520 REPORT-- 1880.

the first six of the exclusion of the potass, there has been nearly 400 los. less carhou

assimilated per acre per annum ; and in some of the still later years the deficiency
has heen very much greater than this.

    We have here, then, the .significant fact that an equal amount of nitrogen wa.s

taken up in both cases, that chlorophyll was abundantly produced, but that the full
amount of carbon was not assimilated. In other words, the nitrogen was there, the
chlorophyll was there, there was the same sun-light for both plots ; but the assimi-
lation-work was not done where there was not a due supply of potass.

     Again, in the field in which barley has now been grown for twenty-nine years

in succession, there are two plots which have annually received the same amount of

--nitrogen the one in conjunction with salts of potass, soda, and magnesia ; and the

other with the same, and superphosphate of lime in addition. The plot without
the superphosphate of lime alwaj's maintains a darker green colour. At any given
period of growth the dry substance of the produce would undoubtedly contain a

 higher percentage of nitrogen ; but there has been a deficient assimilation of carbon,
 amounting to more than 500 lbs. per acre per annum, over a period of twenty-eight

 years. Here again, then, the nitrogen was there, the chlorophyll was there, the
sun-light was there, but the work was not done.

     It may be stated generally that, in comparable cases, depth of green colour, if
not beyond a certain hmit, may be taken to indicate corresponding acti'N'ity of carbon
assimilation ; but the two instances cited are sufticient to show that we may, so far

 as the nitrogen, the chlorophyll, and the light are concerned, have the necessary

 conditions for full assimilation, but not corresponding actual assimilation.

     It cannot, I think, fail to be recognised that in these considerations we have

 opened up to view a very wide field of research, and some of the points involved

 we may hope will receive elucidation from the further prosecution of Dr. Siemens's
experiments. He will himself, I am sure, be the first to admit that what he has

 already accomplished has done more in raising than in settling important questions.
 I understand that he proposes to submit plants to the action of the separated rays
of his artificial light, and the results obtained cannot fail to be of much interest.

But it is obvious that the investigation should now pass from its present initiati\e
character to that of a strictly quantitative inquiry. 'We ought to know not only

 that, under given conditions as to light, plants acquire a deeper green colour and

 attain maturity much earlier than under others, but how much matter is assimi-

 lated in each case, and sometliing also of the comparative chemical characters of

the products. As between the action of one description of light and another, and
 as between the greater or less continuity of exposure, we ought to be able to form a

judgment whether the proper balance between assimilation on the one hand, and
 growth and proper maturation on the other, has been attained ; whether the
 plants have taken up nitrogen and mineral matter, and produced chlorophyll, in a
 greater degree than the quantity and the quality of the light have been able to
 turn to account ; or Avhether the conditions as to light have been such that the
 processes of transformation and growth from the reserve material provided by
 assimilation have not been normal, or have not kept pace with the production of

 that material.

      But one word more in reference to Dr. Siemens's results and proposed extension
 of his inquiries. Even supposing that by submitting growing crops to continuous
 light by the aid of the electric light during the night, they could be brought to

 maturity within a period shorter than at present approximately in proportion tn
 the increased number of hours of exposure, the estimates of the cost of illuminating
 the vegetation of an acre of land certainly do not seem to hold out any hope that
 agriculture is likely to derive benefit frcun sucli an application of science to its
 needs. If, however, the characters of growth and of maturation should prove to
 be suitable for the requirements of horticultural products of luxury and high value,

 it may possibly be otherwise with such productions.

      The above considerations obviously suggest tlie question : "What is the office of
 chlorophyll in the processes of vegetation ? Is it, as has generally been assumed,
 confined to effecting, in some way not yet clearly understood, carbon assimilation,
 and, this done, its function ended ? Or is it, as Pringsheim has recently suggested-,,
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                                                                  521

chiefly of avail in protecting the subjacent cells and their contents from those rays
of light which would he adverse to the secondary processes which have been dis-

tinguished as growth ?

Appropriate as it would seem that I should attempt to lay before you a resume

of results bearing upon the points herein involved, so numerous and so varied have-

been the investigations which have been undertaken on the several branches of the

question in recent years, that adequately to discuss them would occupy the whole

mytime and space at     disposal. I must therefore be content thus to direct atten-

tion to the subject and pass on to other points.

    It has been shown that the plant may receive abundance of nitrogen, may pro-
duce abundance of chlorophyll, and may be subject to the intiuence of sufficient
light, and yet not assimilate a due amount of carbon. On the other hand, it has

been seen that the mineral constituents may be liberally provided, and yet, in the

absence of a sufficient supply of nitrogen in an available condition, the deficiency in

the assimilation of carbon will be still greater. In fact, assuming all the other
necessary conditions to be provided, it was seen that the amount of carbon assimi-

lated depended on the available supply of nitrogen.

    In a certain general sense it may l)e said that the success of the cultivator may

be measured by the amount of carbon he succeeds in accumulating in his crops.

And as, other conditions being provided, the amount of carbon assimilated depends

on the supply of nitrogen in an available form within the reach of the plants, it is

obvious that the question of the sources of the nitrogen of vegetation is one of first

importance. Are they the same for all descriptions of plants ? Are they to be
sought entirely in the soil, or entirely in the atmosphere, or partly in the one

and partly in the other ?
     These are questions which Mr. Lawes and myself have discussed so frequently

that it might seem some apology was due for recurring to the subject here, espe-

cially as 1 referred to it in some of its aspects before this Section at the Sheffield

Meeting last year. But the subject still remains one of first importance to agri-
culture, and it could not be omitted from consideration in such a review as I have
undertaken to give. Moreover, there are some points connected with it still im-

settled, and some still disputed.

    It will be remembered that Pe Saussure's conclusion was that plants did not

assimilate the free or uncombined nitrogen of the atmosphere, and that the)'
derived their nitrogen from the compounds of it existing in the atmosphere, and

especially in the soil. Liebig, too, concluded that plants do not assimilate nitrogen

from the store of it existing in the free or uncombined state, but that ammonia
was their main source, and he assumed the amount of it annually coming down in
rain to be much more than we now know to be the case.

     Referring to our previous papers for full details respecting most of the points

--in question, I will state, as briefly as I can, the main facts known first in regard

to the amount of the measurable, or as yet measured, annual deposition of combined
nitrogen from the atmosphere ; and secondly as to the amount of nitrogen annually

--assimilated over a given area by different crops so that some judgment may

be formed as to whether the measured atmospheric sources are sufficient for the

requirements of agricultural production, or whether, or where, we must look for

other supplies ?

     First, as to the amount of combined nitrogen coming down as ammonia and

nitric acid in the measured aqueous deposits from the atmosphere.

    Judging from the results of determinations made many years ago, partly by

Mr. Way, and partly by ourselves, in the rain, &c., collected at Rothamsted ; from
the results of numerous determinations made much more recently by Professor

Prankland in the deposits collected at Rothamsted, and also in rain collected

elsewhere; from the results obtained by Boussingault in Alsace; from those of

MaritS-Davy  at  the  Meteorological  Observatory  at  Montsouris, Paris                                                                       and  from:
                                                                                                                                            ;
--those of many others made in France and Germany we concluded, some years

ago, that the amount of combined nitrogen annually so coming down from the

atmosphere would not exceed 8 or 10 lbs. per acre per annum in the open country

in Western Europe. Subsequent records would lead to the conclusion that this
--522 EEPORT 1880.

estimate is more probably too liigli than too low. And here it may be mentioned

in passing, that numerous determinations of tlie nitric acid in the drainage water

collected from land at Rothamsted, which had been many years umnanured, indicate
that there may be a considerable annual loss by the soil in that way ; indeed, pro-
bably sometimes mucli more than the amount estimated to be amiually available

from the measured aqueous deposits from the atmosphere.
     It should be observed, however, that the amount of combined nitrogen, especially

of ammonia, is very much greater in a given volume of the minor aqueous deposits
than it is in rain ; and there can be no doubt that there would be more deposited

within the pores of a given area of soil than on an equal area of the non-porous

even surface of a rain-gauge. How much, however, might thus be available beyond

that determined in the collected and measured aqueous deposits, the existing

--evidence does not afford the means of estimating with any certainty.
    The next point to consider is What is the amount of nitrogen annually
obtained over a given area, in different crops, when they are grown without any

supply of it in manure ? The field experiments at Rot hamsted supply important

data relating to this subject.
     Thus, over a period of 32 years (up to 1875 inclusive), wheat yielded an average

of 20-7 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum, without any manure ; but the annual
yield has declined from an average of more than 25 lbs. over the first 8, to less than
16 lbs. over the last 12, of those 32 j-ears ; and the yield (it is true with several
bad seasons), has been still less since.

     Over a period of 24 years, barley yielded 18'3 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per
annum, without any manure ; with a decline from 22 lbs. over the first 12, to only
14'6 lbs. over the next 12 years.

     "With neither wheat nor barley did a complex mineral manure at all materially

A --increase the yield of nitrogen in the crops.
        succession of so-called 'root crops' common turnips, Swedish turnips, and

--sugar beet (with 3 years of barley intei'vening after the first 8 years) yielded,

with a complex mineral manure, an average'' of 26'8 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per

annum over a period of 31 years. The yield declined from an average of 42 lbs.

over the first 8 years, to only 13-1 lbs. (in sugar beet) over the last 5 of the 31 years ;
but it has risen somewhat during the subsequent 4 years, with a change of crop to
mangolds.

      "With the leguminous crop, beans, there was obtained, over a period of 24 years,
31'3 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum without any manure, and 45"5 lbs. with a
complex mineral manure, including potass (but without nitrogen). Without
manure the yield declined from 48-1 lbs. over the first 12 years to only 14'6 lbs.
over the last 12; and with the complex mineral manure it declined from 61 '5 lbs.

--over the first 12, to 29'o lbs. over the last 12, years of the 24.
      Again, an ordinary rotation of crops of turnips, barlej', clover or beans, and

--wheat gave over a period of 28 years an average of 36'8 lbs. of nitrogen per acre

per anniun without any manure, and of 45"2 lbs. with superphosphate of lime alone,
applied once every four years, that is for the root crop. Both without manure, and
with superphosphate of lime alone, there was a considerable decline in the later courses.

   A --very remarkable instance of nitrogen yield is the following in which the

results obtained when barley succeeds barley, that is when one gramineous crop
succeeds another, are contrasted with those when a leguminous crop, clover, inter-
venes between the two cereal crops. Thus, after the growth of six grain crops in
succession by artificial manures alone, the field so treated was divided, and, in 1873,
·on one half barley, and on the other half clover, was grown. The barley yielded

37'3 lbs. of nitrogen ])er acre, but the three cuttings of clover yielded 151 '3 lbs.
In the next year, 1874, barley succeeded on both the barley and the clover portions
of the field. AVhere barley had previously been grown, and had yielded 37'3 lbs.

of nitrogen per acre, it now yielded 39'1 lbs. ; but where the clover had previously

been grown, and had yielded 151 "3 lbs. of nitrogen, the barley succeeding it gave
 69'4 lbs., or 30'.3 lbs. more after the removal of l51'3 lbs. in clover, than after the
 removal of only 37'3 lbs. in barley.

     Nor was this curious result in any way accidental. It is quite consistent with
                                                                                                                              ;

                  lEANSACTIONS OF SECTION B,                                                                        523

agricultural experience that the growth and removal of a highly nitrogenous

leguminous crop should leave the land in high condition for the growth of a grami-

neous corn crop,  which characteristically requires  nitrogenous  manuring                                          and  the
                                                                                                                 ;

determinations of nitrogen in numerous samples of the soil taken from the two

separate portions of the field, after the removal of the barley, and the clover, respec-

tively, concurred in showing considerably more nitrogen, especially in the first

9 inches of depth, in the samples from the portion where the clover had been

crown, than in those from the portion whence the barley had been taken. Here,

then, the surface soil at any rate, had been considerably enriched in nitrogen by the

growth and removal of a very highly nitrogenous crop.

    Lastly, clover has now been grown for twenty-seven years in succession, on a

small plot of garden ground whicli had been under ordinary garden cultivation for
probably two or three centuries. In the fourth year after the commencement of the

experiment, the soil was found to contain, in its upper layers, about four times as
much nitrogen as the farm-arable-land surrounding it ; and it would doubtless be
correspondingly rich in other constituents. It is estimated that an amount of nitro-

gen has iDeen removed in the clover crops grown, corresponding to an average of not

far short of two hundred pounds per acre per annum ; or about ten times as much as
in the cereal crops, and several times as much as in any of the other crops, growing

on ordinary arable land ; and, although the yield continues to be very large, there
has been a marked decline over the second half of the period compared withthe

first. Of course, calculations of the produce of a few square yards into quantities
per acre can only be approximately correct. But there can at any rate be no doubt
whatever, that the amount of nitrogen annually removed has been very great ; and
very far beyond what it would loe possible to attain on ordinary arable land ; where,
indeed, we have not succeeded in getting even a moderate growth of clover for more

than a very few years in succession.
     One other illustration should be given of the amounts of nitrogen removed from

a given area of land by different descriptions of crop, namely, of the results obtained

when plants of the gramineous, the leguminous, and other families, are growing

together, as in the mixed herbage of grass-land.
     It is necessary here to remind you that gramineous crops grown separately on

arable land, such as wheat, barley, or oats, contain a comparatively small percentage
of nitrogen, and assimilate a comparatively small amount of it over a given area.
Yet, nitrogenous manures have generally a very striking effect in increasing the

growth of such crops. The highly nitrogenous leguminous crops (such as beans and
clover), on the other band, j-ield, as has been seen, very much more nitrogen over a
given area, and yet they are by no means characteristically benefited by direct
nitrogenous manuring; whilst, as has been sho-wni, their growth is considerably

increased, and they jdeld considerably more nitrogen over a given area, nnder the

influence of purely mineral manures, and especially of potass manures. Bearing

these facts in mind, the following results, obtained on the mixed herbage of grass

land, will be seen to be quite consistent.

   A plot of such mixed herbage, left entirely unmanured, gave over twenty years,

an average of .33 pounds of nitrogen per acre per anmmi. Over the same period

another plot, which received annually a complex mineral manure, including potass,

during the first six years, but excluding it during the last fourteen years, yielded

46'3 lbs of nitrogen ; whilst another, which received the mixed mineral manure,

including potass, every year of the twentj^ yielded 55-6 lbs. of nitrogen per acre

per annmn. "Without manure, there was some decline of yield in the later years
with the partial mineral manuring there was a gi-eater decline ; but with the com-
plete mineral manuring throughout the whole period, there was even some increase

in the yield of nitrogen in the later years.

Now, the herbage growing without manure comprised about fifty species, repre-

senting about twenty natural families; that growing with the limited supply of

potass comprised fewer species, but a larger amount of the produce, especially in
the earlier years, consisted of leguminous species, and the yield of nitrogen was
greater. Lastly, the plot receiving potass every year yielded still more leguminous

herbage, and, accordingly, still more nitrogen.
            --

524 KEPOKT-- 1880,

   --The most striking points brought out by the foregoing illustrations are the

following:

     First. Without nitrogenous manure, the gramineous crops annually yielded, for
many years in succession, much more nitrogen over a given area than is accounted
for by the amount of combined nitrogen annually coming down in the measured
aqueous deposits from the atmosphere.

     Second. The root crops yielded more nitrogen than the cereal crops, and the
leguminous crops very much more still.

   --Third. In all cases whether of cereal crops, root crops, leguminous crops, or a

rotation of crops the decline in the annual yield of nitroffen, ivhen none loas supplied^

ivas vei-xj yreat.

    How are these results to be explained ? Whence comes the nitrogen ? and

especially whence comes the much larger amount taken up by plants of the
leguminous and some other families, than by the gramineiE ? And, lastly, what i.'i
the significance of the great decline in the yield of nitrogen in all the crops when
none is supplied in the manure ?

    Many explanations have been offered. It has been assumed that the combined
nitrogen annually coming down from the atmosphere is Nery much larger than we

have estimated it, and that it is sufficient for all the requirements of annual growth.
It has been supposed that ' broad-leaved plants ' have the power of taking up nitro-
gen in some form from the atmosphere, in a degree, or in a manner, not possessed
by the narrow-leaved gramineie. It has been argued that, in the last stages of
the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, hydrogen is evolved, and that this
nascent hydrogen combines with the free nitrogen of the atmosphere, and so forms
ammonia. It has been suggested that ozone maj' be evolved in the oxidation of
organic matter in the soil, and that, uniting with free nitrogen, nitric acid woidd be
produced. Lastly, it has by some been concluded that plants assimilate tbe free
nitrogen of the atmosphere, and that some descriptions are able to do this in a
greater degree than others.

    We have discussed these various points on more than one occasion ; and we have

given our reasons for conchiding that none of the explanations enumerated can be
taken as accounting for the facts of growth.

      Confining attention here to the question of the assimilation of free nitrogen by
plants, it is obvious that, if this were established, most of our difficulties would
vanish. This question has been the subject of a great deal of experimental inquiry,
from the time that Boussingault entered upon it, about tlio year 1837, nearly up to the
present time. About twenty years ago it was elaborately investigated at Rotham-
sted. In publishing the results of that inquiry, those of others relating to it were
fully discussed ; and although the recorded e\'idence is admittedly very conflicting,

we then came to the conclusion, and still adhere to it, that the balance of the direct

experimental evidence on the point is decidedly against the supposition of the assi-

milation of free nitrogen by plants. Indeed, the strongest argument we know of in

its favour, is, that some such explanation is wanted.
      Not only is the balance of direct experimental evidence against the assumption

that plants assimilate free or uncombined nitrogen, Ijut it seems to us that the
balance of existing indirect evidence is also in favour of another explanation of our

 difficulties.

     I have asked what is the significance of the gradual decline of produce of all
the difl'erent crops when continuously grown without nitrogenous manure ? It
 cannot be that, in growing the same crop year after year on the same land, there is
any residue left in the soil that is injurious to the suljsequent growth of the same
 description of crop ; for (excepting the beans) uku'c of each description of crop has
been grown year after year on the same land than the a\erage yield of the country

--at large under ordinary rotation, and ordinary treatment provided only, that suit-

able soil-conditions were supplied. Nor can the diminishing produce, and the
 diminishing yield of nitrogen, be accounted for on the supposition that there was a

 deficient supply of available mineral constituents in the soil. For, it has teen

 shown that the cereals yielded little more, and declined nearly as much as without
 manure, when a complex mineral manure was used, such as was proved to be ade-
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                                                                      525

quale when available nitrofjen was also supplied. So far as the root crops are con-
cerned, the yield of nitrofren, thoiiorh it declined very much, was greater at first, and
on the average, than in the case of the cereals. As to the leg-uminosfe, which re-

quire so much nitrogen from somewhere, it is to be observed that on ordinary arable

land the yield has not been maintained under any conditions of manuring ; and the

decline was nearly as marked with mineral manures as without any manure. Com-

pared with the growth of the leguminosse on arable land, the remarkable result with
the o-arden clover would seem clearly to indicate that the question was one of soil,

and not of atmospheric supply. And the fact that all the other crops will yield
full agricultural results even on ordinary arable land, when proper manures are

applied, is surely very strong evidence that it is with them, too, a question of soil,

and not of atmospheric supply.

But we have other evidence leading to the same conclusion. Unfortunately

Ave have not reliable samples of the soil of the difierent experimental fields taken at

the commencement of each series of experiments, and subsequently at stated inter-

Wevals.  have, nevertheless, in some cases, evidence sufiicient to show whether or

not the nitrogen of the soil has suffered diminution by the continuous growth of the

crop without nitrogenous manure.

    Thus, we have determined the nitrogen in the soil of the continuously unmanured

wheat plot at several successive periods, and the results prove that a gradual reduc-

tion in the nitrogen of the soil is going on ; and, so far as we are able to form a judg-

ment on the point, the diminution is approximately equal to the nitrogen taken out
in crops ; and the amount estimated to be received in the annual rainfall is approxi-
mately balanced by the amount lost by the land as nitrates in the drainage water.

     In the case of the continuous root-crop soil, on which the decline in the yield of

nitrogen in the crop was so marked, the percentage of nitrogen, after the experiment
had been continued for twenty-se\en years, was found to be lower where no nitrogen
had been applied than in any other arable land on the farm which has been

examined.
     In the case of the experiments on the mixed herbage of grass land, the soil of

the plot which, under the influence of a mixed mineral manure, including potass,
had yielded such a large amount of leguminous herbage and such a large amoimt of
nitrogen, showed, after twenty years, a considerably lower percentage of nitrogen

than that of any other plot in the series.

    Lastly, determinations of nitrogen in the garden soil which has yielded so much

nitrogen in clover, made in samples collected in the fourth and the twentj'-sixth
years of the twenty-seven of the experiments, show a ^erj^ large diminution in the
percentage of nitrogen. The diminution, to the depth of 9 inches only, represents
approximately three-fourths as much as the amount estimated to be taken out in

the clover during the intervening period ; and the indication is, that there has been

a considerable reduction in the lower depths also. It is to be supposed, however,

--that there would be loss in other ways than by the crop alone.
    I vrould ask. Have we not in these facts that full amounts of the different crops

can be grown, provided proper soil-conditions are supplied ; that without nitrogenous

manure the yield of nitrogen    in  the  crop  rapidly declines                                                                           and that,  coincidently
                                                                                                                                       ;
--with this, there is a decline in the percentage of nitrogen in the soil have we not

in these facts cumulative e\"idence pointing to the soil, rather than to the atmosphere,

as the source of the nitrogen of our crops ?

    In reference to this point, I may mention that the ordinary arable soil at Rotham-
sted may be estimated to contain about 3000 lbs. of nitrogen per acre in the first

1) inches of depth, about 1700 lbs. in the second 9 inches and about 1500 lbs. in

--the third 9 inches or a total of alx)ut 6200 lbs. per acre to the depth of 27

inches.

     In this connection, it is of interest to state that a sample of Oxford clay, obtained

in the sub-Wealden exploration boring, at a depth of between 600 and 600 feet

(and which was kindly given to me by the President of the Association, Professor

Ramsay, some years ago), showed, on analysis at Rothamsted, approximately the

same percentage of nitrogen as the subsoil at Rothamsted taken to tlie depth of

sihont 4 feet only.

      Lastly, in a letter received from Boussingault some j'ears ago, referring to the
 sources whence tlie nitrogen of vegetation is derived, lie says :

     ' From the atmosphere, because it furnishes ammonia in the form of carbonate,
 nitrates, or nitrites, and various kinds of dust. Theodore de Saussure was the first
 to demonstrate the presence of ammonia in the air, and consequently in meteoric
 waters. Liehig exaggerated the influence of this ammonia on vegetation, since he
 went so far as to deny the utility of the nitrogen which forms a part of farm-yard

 manure. This influence is nevertheless real, and comprised witliin limits which
 have quite recently been indicated in the remarkable investigations of M. Schlosing.

      ' From the soil, which, besides furnishing the crops with mineral alkaline sub-
 stances, provides them -w-itli nitrogen, by ammonia, and by nitrates, which are

 formed in the soil at the expense of the nitrogenous matters contained in diluvium,
 which is the basis of vegetable earth ; compounds in which nitrogen exists in stable

 combination, only becoming fertilising by the effect of time. If we take into

 account their immensity, the deposits of the last geological periods must be con-
 sidered as an inexliaustible reserve of fertilising agents. Forests, prairies, and
 some vineyards have really no other manures than what are furnished by the
 atmosphere and by the soU. Since the Ijasis of all cultivated land contains
 materials capable of giving rise to nitrogenous combinations, and to mineral sub-
 stances, assimilable by ])lants, it is not necessary to suppose that in a system of
 cultivation the excess of nitrogen found in the crops is derived from the free nitro-

 gen of the atmosphere. As for the absorption of the gaseous nitrogen of the air by
. vegetable earth, I am not acquainted ynt\i a single irreproachable observation that

 establishes it ; not only does the earth not absorb gaseous nitrogen, but it gives it

 off", as you have observed in conjunction ^^^th Mr. Lawes, as Reiset has shown in
 the case of dung, as M. Schlosing and I have proved in our researches on nitri-

 fication.

       ' If there is one fact perfectly demonstrated in physiology, it is this of the non-

 assimilation of free nitrogen by plants ; and I may add by plants of an inferior

 order, such as mycoderms and mushrooms (Translation).'
      If, then, our soils are subject to a continual loss of nitrogen by drainage, pro-

--bably in many cases more than they receive of combined nitrogen from the atmo-

 sphere if the nitrogen of our crops is derived mainly from the soil, and not from

--the atmosphere and if, when due return is not made from without, we are draw-
--ing upon what may be termed the store of nitrogen of the soil itself is there

not, in the case of manj' soils at any rate, as much danger of the exhaustion of

 their available nitrogen as there has been supposed to be of the exhaustion of their
 available mineral constituents ?

      I had hoped to say something more about soils, to advance our knowledge re-
 specting Avhich an immense amount of investigation has been devoted of late years,

but in regard to which we have yet very much more to learn. I must, however,
now turn to other matters.

      I have thus far directed attention to some pomts of importance in connection

with the sources of the constituents of our crops, and I must now briefly refer to

 some in connection with the composition, and to some relating to the uses, of the

crops themselves.

     As to composition, I must confine mj-self to indicating something of what is
known of the condition of the nitrogen in our various crops ; though I had intended

to say something respecting the carbo-hydrates, and especially respecting the

--varioiis members of the cellulose group.
     As to the nitrogen in our first experiments on the feeding of animals, made in

 1847, 1848, and 1849, the results of which were published in the last-mentioned year

--we found that, in the case of succulent roots used as food, not only were they not

of value as food in proportion to their richness in nitrogen, but when the percentage
of it was higher than a certain normal amount, indicating relative succulence and
immaturity, they were positively injurious to the animals. So marked was the

 variation of result according to the condition of maturity or otherwise of the

foods employed, that, when re^^ewing the results of the experiments which had up
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  527

to that time been conducted, in a paper read before tliis Section of the British

Association at the Belfast Meeting in 1852 (and whicli was published in full in the
annual volume^), we stated that the mode of estimatin": the amount of proteiiie
compounds by multiplying the percentage of nitrogen by 6-3 was far from accurate,
especially when applied to succident vegetable foods, and that the individual com-
pounds ought to be determined. The Rothamsted Laboratory staff was, however,
much smafler then than it is now, and with the pressure of many other subjects
upon us, it was at that time quite impossible to follow up the enquiry in that

direction.

      It is, indeed, only within the last ten years or so, that the question has been

taken up at all systematically ; but we are already indebted to E. Schulze, A.

Urick, Church, Sachsse, Maercker, Kellner, Vines, Emmerling, and others, for

important results relating to it.

     Our knowledge in regard to the subject is, however, still very imperfect. But

--it is in progress of investigation from two distinctly ditierent points of ^iew from

that of the vegetable physiologist, and that of' the agricultural chemist. The

veo-etable physiologist seeks to trace the changes that occur in the germination of
the seed, and during the subsequent life-history of the plant, to the production of

seed again. The agricidtural chemist takes the various vegetable products in the

condition in which they are used on the farm, or sold from it. And as a very large
proportion of what is grown, such as grass, hay, roots, tubers, and various green

crops, are not matured productions, it comes to be a matter of great importance to
consider whether or not any large proportion of the nitrogenous contents of such
products is in such condition as not to be of avail to the animals which consume

them in their food ?

    We cannot say that the whole of the nitrogen in the seeds with which we have

to deal exists as albuminoids. But we may safely assume that the nearer they

approach to perfect ripeness, the less of non-albuminoid nitrogenous matters will
they contain ; and, in the case of the cereal grains at any rate, it is probable that if
really perfectly ripe they will contain very nearly the whole of their nitrogen as
albuminoids. 'With regard to some leguminous and other seeds, which contain

peculiar nitrogenous bodies, the range may, however, be wider.

     But whatever the condition of the nitrogenous bodies iii the seeds we grow or

sow, with germination begins a material change. Albuminoids are transformed
into peptones, or peptone-like bodies, or degraded into various amido- or other com-
pounds. Such change into more soluble and more diffusible bodies is, it is to be
 supposed, essential to their free migration, and to their subserviency to the purposes
 of growth. In the case of the germination, especially of some leguminous seeds,
 asparagine has been found to be a very prominent product of such degradation of

 the albuminoids ; but it would seem that this disappears as the green parts are

developed. But now the plant begins to receive supplies of nitrogen from_ the

 soil, as nitrates or ammonia, and it would seem that amides constitute a consider-

 able proportion of the produced nitrogenous bodies, apparently as an intermediate

 stage in the formation of albuminoids. At any rate, such bodies are found to exist
 largely in the immature plant ; whilst the amount of them diminishes as the plant,

 or its various parts, approach to maturity.

     But not only have we thus, in unripened vegetable productions, a gr.eater or

 less, and sometimes a very large, proportion of the nitrogenous bodies formed within

 the plant, existing as amido-compounds, but we may have a large amount existing

 in the juices as nitric acid, and some as ammonia. Sec. Thus, E. Schulze determined
 the nitric acid in various ' roots ; ' and he found that, in some mangolds, more than
 one-third of the total nitrogen existed in that form, and about one-tenth as much

 as ammonia. In a considerable series at Rothamsted, we have found an extremely

 variable proportion existing as nitric acid, according to the size, succulence, or

 degree of maturity, of the roots ; the amount being, as a rule, the least with the
 ripest and less highly nitrogenous roots, and the most with the most succulent,
 unripe, and highly nitrogenous ones. In some cases it reached as much as from

      ' ' On the Composition of Foods in relation to Respiration and the Feeding of

 Animals.'
--528
                              EEPORT 1880.

20 to nearly 30 per cent, of the total nitrogen. In many other immature vegetable

products nitric acid and ammonia have been found ; but, so far as 1 remember, in

none in anything like so large a proportion as in the so-called ' root-crops,' es-

pecially manoglds. In many, however, the quantity appears to be immaterial ; and
it is remarkable that whilst thei-e is so much in the ' roots,' little or none is found

in potatos.

    No wonder that, in the experiments already referred to, we foimd the feeding

result to be the worse the more succulent and immature the roots, and the higher

their percentage of nitrogen, accordingly.

     But it is to the difference in amount of the albuminoid bodies themselves, in

different descriptions of vegetable produce, that I wish specially to direct attention,

making, however, some reference to what is known of the proportion of the

nitrogen existing as amido-compounds.

In some mangolds E. Schulze found only from about 20 to 22 per cent, of their

total nitrogen to exist as insoluble and soluble albumin. But he found in one case

32*5, aud in the other 408, per cent, of the total nitrogen as amides. In a large

series of determinations at Eothamsted, by Church's method, we found a variation

of from under 20 to over 40 per cent, of the total nitrogen of mangolds to exist as

albuminoids ; or, in other words, from nearly 60 to over 80 per cent, of it in the

non-albuminoid condition.

In potatos Schulze foimd from under 50 to Go per cent, of the total nitrogen

as soluble and insoluble albumin, and from 27'7 to 49-1 per cent, as neutral and

iicid amides. In a series of potatos grown at Rothamsted, under very various
conditions as to manuring, and in two different seasons, we found the nitrogen as

albuminoids to range from little over 50 to more than 71 per cent, of the total

nitrogen ; leaving, of course, from less than 30 to nearly 50 per cent, to be

accounted for in other ways.

Kelbier determined the amount of nitrogen as albuminoids, and as amido-com-

pounds, in a considerable series of green foods, both leguminous and gramineous, cut

at different stages of their growth. The proportion of the total nitrogen not as

albuminoids was, upon the whole, greater in the leguminosje than in the graminese.

In both, however, the proportion as albuminoids increased as the plants approached

to maturity. The proportion as albuminoids was in all these products very much

larger than in roots, and generally larger than in potatos. In the case of first-crop

meadow hay, we found in the separated gramineous lierbage 76'4, in the leguminous

herbage 82, and in the miscellaneous herbage 80'3 per cent of the nitrogen as

albuminoids ; and in the second crop 86'2 per cent, in the gramineous, 88"3 per

Howcent, in the leguminous, and 88T per cent, in the miscellaneous berbage.                                                                                                                                           far

the higher proportion of the nitrogen as albuminoids in the second crops is to be

taken as any indication of the characteristics of the autumn growth, or how far it is
to be attributed to the accidental condition of the weather, may be a question.

These illustrations are sufficient to give some idea of the range and proportion

of the nitrogen in different feeding crops which does not exist as albuminoids ; and
they are sufficient to show that a very large proportion of the non-albuminoid

matter exists as -N'arious amido-compounds. The question arises, therefore, whether

these bodies contribute in any way to the nutrition of the animals which feed upon

Wethem ?  have but little experimental e\-idence on this point. As green herbage

is the natural food of many descriptions of animal, we might suppose that charac-

teristic constituents  of it would not  Ije without some value as food                                                                                                                                           but  the culti-
                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

vated root crops are much more artificial productions, and it is in them that we

find such a very large proportion of non-albuminoid nitrogen. With respect to

some of the amido-compounds, at any rate, direct experiments seem to show that

they are digested in the animal body, and increase the elimmation of urea. Weiske

and Schrodt found that rabbits receiving, as their only nitrogenous food, either

asparagine or gelatin, wasted and died ; but a rabbit receiAdng both asparagine and

gelatin increased in weight and survived to the end of the experiment, which

lasted seventy-two days. From the results of other experiments made with sheep,

they concluded that both asparagine aud gelatin protect the albuminoids of the

bodv from oxidation.

  --These considerations lead me, in conclusion, to refer briefly and I promise
--it shall be as briefly as is consistent with clearness to the two very much disputed

questions of the origin of muscular jwtoer, and the sources of the fat of the anitnal
body. These subjects Mr. Lawes and myself have frequently discussed elsewhere
but as the controversy has assumed a new phase quite recently, it seems desirable
and appropriate that I should recur to it on the present occasion.

     With regard to the question of the sources in the food of the fat of the animal

body, Liebig originally maintained that although fat might be formed from the
nitrogenous compounds within the body, the main source of it in the herbivora
was the carbo-hydrates. In his later writings, he sharply criticised the experi-

ments and arguments of those who have maintained the formation of fat chiefly

from the proteine compounds; but he at the same time seems to attach more

importance to that source than he formerly did. He gives it as his opinion that

the question cannot be settled by experiments with herbivora. He adds that what

we know with certainty is that, with these animals, albuminates and carbo-
hydrates work together to produce fat ; but whether the non-nitrogenous product,

fat, has its origin in the albiunin or in the carbo-hydrate, h considers it not easy

to determine.

    At the time when we commenced our experiments on the feeding of animals in
] 847, the question whether the fat of the animals fed for human food was mainly

derived from albuminoids or from carbo-hydrates had been scarcely raised, or at

--least it was not prominent. The question then was rather whether the herbivora

--received their fat ready formed in their food, or whether it was produced within

the body the latter view being that which Liebig had so forcibly urged, at the
same time maintaining that at any rate its chief source was the carbo-hydrates.

Accordingly, our experiments were not specially arranged to determine whether

or not the whole of the fat produced coidd or could not be derived from the albu-

minoids.

For each description of animal, oxen, sheep, and pigs, such foods as had been

--established by common experience to be appropriate were selected. The general

plan of the experiments was to give to one set a fixed amoimt of a recognised good

food, containing known quantities of nitrogen, fatty matter, &c. ; to another set the

same amoimt of another food, of different characters in these respects ; to other

sets also fixed amounts  of other foods in the same way                                                                                                                         and then there was given,
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

to the whole series, the same complementary food ad libitum. Or, to one set was

supplied a imiform food rich in nitrogen, and to others imiform foods poorer in
nitrogen, and so on, in each case ad libitutn.

     It will be seen that, in this way, a great variety of dietaries was arranged and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

it will be observed that in each case the animals themselves fixed their consumption

according to the requirements of the system.

considerable reservation, especially in the case of all immature vegetable produce.

genous substance, when interpreting the results, it was always considered whether or

not the food contained much or little of probably indigestible woody matter.

The animals being periodically weighed, we were thus able to calculate the

amounts of the so-estimated nitrogenous substance, and of the total non-nitroo-enous

substance, including and excluding fat, consumed--/or a given live-iueight icithin a
given time, and to produce a given aynount of increase in live-xoeight.

     Experiments were made with a large number of sheep, and a large number of
pigs. And, even without making allowance for the diflferent condition of the nitro-

genous or of the non-nitrogenous constituents, in comparable foods, the results ob-
tained imiformly indicated that both the amount consumed by a given live-weight of
.animal within a given time, and that required to produce a given amount of increase,

were determined much more by the amount of the non-nitrogenous than by that of

tie nitrogenous constituents which the food supplied. And when allowance was

made for the different condition of the nitrogenous constituents, and for the greater
or less amount of the non-nitrogenous ones which would probably be indigestible
and effete, the indications were still more remarkable and conclusive.

     In very many cases the animals were slaughtered, and carefully examined as to
whether the tendency of development had been more that of growth in frame and

--flesh, or in fatness. Here, again, the e\'ideuce was clear that the tendency to growth

in frame and flesh was favoured by a high proportion of nitrogen in the food, and
that to the production of fat by a high proportion of digestible non-nitrogenous

constituents.

In a few cases the actual amount of fat in the animals in the lean, and in the fat

condition, was determined ; and the results admitted of no doubt whatever that a

very large proportion of the stored-up fat could not have been derived from the

fatty matter of the food, and must have been produced within the body.

     So decisive and consistent were the very numerous and very varied results in

--regard to these points, that we had no hesitation in concluding not only that much

of the fat stored up was produced within the body, but that the source of much,

at any rate, of the produced fat must have been the non-nitrogenous constituents of

--the food in other words, the carho-hydrates.

As already stated, however, as the question whether the source of the produced

fat was the proteine compounds or the carbo-hydrates was not then prominent, we

had not so arranged the experiments as to obtain the largest possible increase in fat

with the smallest possible supply of nitrogenous compounds in the food ; nor did we

then even calculate whether or not there was sufficient nitrogenous matter consumed

to be the eom-ce of the whole of the fat produced.

This question, indeed, excited very little interest, until, at a meeting of the

Congress of Agricultural Chemists held at Munich in 1865 (at which I happened

to be present), Professor Voit, from the results of experiments made in Pettenkofer's

respiration apparatus with dogs fed on flesh, announced his conclusion that fat

must have been produced from the nitrogenous substance, and that this was probably

--the chief, if not the only, source of the fat, even of herbivora an opinion which he

subsequently urged much more positively.

In the discussion which followed the reading of Professor Voit's paper, Baron

Liebig forcibly called in question his conclusions ; maintaining not only that it was

inadmissible to form conclusions on such a point in regard to herbivora, from the

results of experiments made with carnivora, but also that direct quantitative results

obtained with herbivorous animals had afforded apparently conclusive evidence in

favour of the opposite view.

Voit's paper excited considerable controversy, in which Mr. Lawes and myself

Wejoined.      maintained that experiments to determine such a question should be

made, not with carnivora or omnivora fed on flesh, but with herbivora fed on their

appropriate fattening food, and on such herbivora as common experience showed

Weto be pre-eminently fat-producers.  pointed out ^ that the pig comprised, for a

given live-weight, a comparatively small proportion of alimentary organs and con-

tents ; that, compared with that of the ruminants, his food was of a high character,
yielding, for a given weight of it, much more total increase, much more fat, and

much less necessarily effete matter ; that, in proportion to his weight, he consumes

a larger amount of food, and yields a larger amount, both of total increase and of

fat, within a given time ; and, lastly, that he contains a larger proportion of fat,

both in a given live weight and in his increase whilst fattening.

It is ob^dous that, with these characteristics, there is much less probable range

of error in calculating the amoimt and the composition of the increase in live-weight

in relation to the amount and composition of the food consumed, than in the case
of the ruminants ; and that, therefore, the pig is veiy much more appropriate for

the purpose of experiments to determine the sources in its food of the fat it pro-

duces.

    Accordingly, we calculated a number of our early experiments made with pigs,
to determine whether or not the nitrogenous substance they consumed was suffi-

cieiit for the formation of the fat they produced. For simplicity of illustration, and
to give every possible advantage to the view that nitrogenous substance might have

--been the source of the produced fat, we assumed the whole of the crude fat of the

food to have been stored up in the animal thus estimating a minimum amount to
be produced. Then, again, we supposed the whole of the nitrogenous substance of

the food to be perfectly digested, and to become available for the purposes of the
system. Lastly, after deducting the amount of nitrogenous substance estimated to
be stored up as such, the whole of the remainder was reckoned to be so broken up
that no other carbon-compoimds than fat and urea would be produced.

     The result was, that, even adopting these inadmissible assumptions, in all the
cases in which, according to common experience, the food was admittedly the most
appropriate for the fattening of the animal, the calculation showed that a large
amount of fat had been produced which could not have been derived from the
nitrogenous substance of the food, and must therefore have had its source in the

carbo-hydrates. Such a result is, moreover, entirely accordant with experience in

practical feeding.

     Reviewing the whole subject in great detail in 1869, Professor Voit refers to

these results and calculations. He confesses that he has not been able to get a

general view of the experiments from the mass of figures recorded, and from his

comments he shows that he has on some points misunderstood them. He admits,

however, that, as the figures stand, it would appear that fat had, in some instances,

been derived from the carbo-hydrates. Still, he says, he cannot allow himself to

consider that a transformation of carbo-hydrates into fat has thus been proved.
     Professor Emil von Wolff, again, in his ' Landwirthschaftlicbe Fiitterungslehre,'

referring to the same experiments, admits that they are almost incomprehensible

unless we assume the direct concurrence of the carbo-hydrates in the formation of

fat. He, nevertheless, seems to consider that evidence of the kind in question is
inconclusive ; and he suggests that experiments with pigs should be made ui a

respiration apparatus to determine the point.

     Mr. Lawes and myself entertained, however, the utmost confidence that the
question was of easy settlement without any such apparatus, provided only suit-

able animals and suitable foods were selected. I, accordingly, gave a paper on the

subject in the /Sferfi'ow yV/r Landwirthschaft-und Acp-icuUur-Chemie, at the Natur-

--forscher Versammlung held at Hamburg in 1876.^ The points which I particu-

larly insisted upon were that the pig should be the subject of experiment ; that he

should be allowed to take as much as he woidd eat of his most appropriate fattening

food, so that his increase, and the fat he produced, should bear as large a proportion

as possible to his weight, to the total food, and to the total nitrogenous substance

consimied. Finally, it was maintained that, if these conditions were observed, and

the constituents of the food determined, and those of the increase of the animal

estimated according to recognised methods, the results covdd not fail to be perfectly

conclusive, without the intervention, either of a respiration apparatus, or of the

analysis of the solid and liqiud matters voided.

Results so obtained were adduced in proof of the correctness of the conclusions

Wearrived at.       at the same time admitted that, although, for reasons indicated,

we had always assumed that fat was formed from the carbo-hydrates in the case of

ruminants as well as of pigs, yet, as in our experiments with those animals we had

supplied too large amoiauts of ready formed fat, or of nitrogenous matter, or of

both, it coidd not be shown so conclusively by the same mode of calculation in

their case as in that of pigs.

In the discussion which followed. Professor Henneberg agreed that it seemed

probable that fat coidd be formed from the carbo-hydrates in the case of pigs. In
the case of experiments with other animals, however, the amount of fat produced
was too nearly balanced by the amoimt of fat and albuminous matters available, to

afford conclusive evidence on the point.

Quite recently, Professor Emil von Wolff (' Landwirthschaftlicbe Jahrbiicher,'

    ' The substance of that communication is given in the Journal of Anatomy an

Phyndlogy, vol. xi. part iv.

Baud viii. 1879, Supplement) has applied the same mode of calculation to results ol>-

tained by liimself with pigs some years ago. He concluded that the "whole of the body

fat could not have been formed without the direct co-operation of the carbo-hydrates

of the food. But what is of greater interest still is, that he also calculated, in the

same way, the results of some then quite recent experiments of Henneberg, Kern,

and Wattenberg, with sheep. He thus foimd that, even including the whole of the

estimated amides with the albumin, there must have been a considerable production

of fat from the carbo-hydrates ; and, excluding the amides, the amount reckoned to
be derived from the carbo-hydrates was of course much greater.

    I will only add, on this point, that, on re-calculating some of our early results

with sheep, which did not afford sufficiently conclusive evidence when the whole of

the nitrogen of the food was reckoned as albumin, these show a very considerable

formation of fat from the carbo-hydrates, if deduction be made for the probable

amount of non-albuminoid nitrogenous matter of the food.

   We have now, then, the two agricultural chemists of perhaps the highest

authority, both as experimenters and writers on this subject on the Continent,

giving in their adhesion to the view, that the fat of the herbivora, which we feed
for human food, may be, and probably is, largely produced from the carbo-hydrates.

I dare say, however, that some physiologists will not change their view until Voit

gives them sanction by changing his, which, so far as I know, he has not yet done.

     The question whicli has been currently entitled tliat of ' The Origin of Muscidar
Power,' or ' The Sources of Muscular Po^ver,' has also been the subject of much
investigation, and of much conflict of opinion, since the first publication of Liebig's

views respecting it in 1842.

    As I have already pointed out, he then maintained that the amoimt of muscular

tissue transformed, the amoimt of nitrogenous substance oxidated, was the measure

of the force generated in the body. He accordingly concluded that the requirement

for the nitrogenous constituents of food would be increased in proportion to the in-

crease of the force expended. In his more recent writings on the subject, he freely

criticises those who take an opposite \-iew. He nevertheless grants that the secretion

of  urea is not a  measure of  the  force  exerted                                       but, on the other hand, he does  not
                                                                                      ;

commit himself to the admission that the oxidation of the carbo-hydrates is a source

of muscular power.

    The results of our own early and very numerous feeding experiments were, as

has been said, extremely accoi'dant in showing that, pro\'ided the nitrogenous con-
stituents in the food were not below a certain rather limited amount, it was the

quantity of the digestible and available non-nitrogenous constituents, and not that

--of the nitrogenous substance, that determined botli the amount consumed by a given

live-weiqht within a given time, and the amount of increase in live-weight 2froduced.
They ako showed that one animal, or one set of animals, might consume two or

three times as much nitrogenous substance in proportion to a given live-weight

within a given time as others in precisely comparable conditions as to rest or exercise.
It was further proved that they did not store up nitrogenous subtance at all in
proportion to the greater or less amoimt of it suppHed in the food, but that the

excess reappeared in the liquid and solid matters voided.

    So striking were these results, that we were led to turn our attention to human
dietaries, and also to a consideration of the management of the animal body under-

going somewhat excessive labour, as, for instance, the himter, the racer, the
cab-horse, and the foxhound, and also pugilists and runners. Stated in a very few
words, the conclusion at which we arrived from these inquiries (which were sum-

--marised in our paper given at Belfast in 1852) was that, unless the system were

overtaxed, the demand induced by an increased exercise of force was more charac-
terised by an increased requirement for the more specially respiratory, than for the

nitrogenous, constituents of food.

    Soon aftei-wards, in 1854, we found by direct experiments with two animals in
exactly equal conditions as to exercise, both being in fact at rest, that the amount
of urea passed by one feeding on highly nitrogenous food was more than twice as

great as that fed on a food comparative^ poor in nitrogen.

    It was clear, therefore, that the rule which had been laid down by Liebig, and
                                                                    --

whicli has been assumed to be correct by so many writers, even up to the present
time, did not bold good--namely, tliat ' The sum of the mechanical effects pro-
duced in two indi\-iduals, in the same temperature, is proportional to the amount of

nitrogen in their urine ; whether the mechanical force has been employed in ^olun-

--tary or involuntary motions, whether it has been consumed by the limbs nr by tlie

heart and other viscera ' unless, indeed, as has been assumed by some experi-
menters, there is, with increased nitrogen in the food, an increased amount of

mechanical force employed in the ' involuntary motions ' sufficient to account for

the increased amount of urea voided.
    The question remained in this condition until 1860, when Bischoff and Voit

published the results of a long series of experiments made with a dog. They found

that, even when the animal was kept at rest, the amount of urea voided varied

closely in proportion to the variation in the amount of nitrogenous substance

--given'in the food a fact whicli they explained on the assumption tliat there must

have been a corresponding increase in the force exercised in the conduct of the
actions proceeding within the body itself in connection with the disposal of the
increased amount of nitrogeneous substance consumed. Subsequently, however,

they found that the amount of urea passed by the animal was, -\\ath equal condi-
tions as to food, &c., no greater when he was subjected to labour than when at
rest ; whilst, on the other hand, the carbonic acid evolved was much increased

bv such exercise. They accordingly somewhat modified their views.
     In 1866 appeared a paper by Professors Fick and Wislicenus, giving tlie results

obtained in a mountain ascent. 'They found that practically the amount of urea
voided was scarcely increased by the labour thus undertaken. Professor Frankland
gave an account of these experiments in a lecture at the Royal Institution in the
same year ; and he subsequently followed up the subject by an investigation of the

heat de^·eloped in the combustion of various articles of food, applying the results in

illustration of the phenomena of the exercise of force.
     Lastly, KeUner has made some very interesting experiments with a horse at

Hohenhe'im, the results of which were published last year. In one series, tlie ex-
periment was divided into five periods, the same food being given throughout ; but
the animal accomplished different distances, and drew different weights, the draught
being measured by a horse-dynamometer. The changes in live-weight, the amount
of water drunk-, the temperature, the amount of matters voided, and their contents

in nitrogen, were also determined.

The result was, tliat with oidy moderate labour there was no marked increase

in the nitrogen eliminated in the urine, but that with excessive labour the animal

lost weight and eliminated more nitrogen. Kellner concluded, accordingly, that,

under  certain  circumstances, muscular  action can  increase  the  transformation of
                                                                                                                                                      ^

albumin in the organism in a direct way ; but that, nevertheless, in the first line

--is the oxidation of the non-nitrogenous matters carbo-hydrates and fat, next comes

in requisition the circulation-albumin, and finally the organ-albumin is attacked.

In reference to these conclusions from the most recent experiments relating^ to

the subject, we may wind up this brief historical sketch of the changes of view-

--respecting it, with, the following quotation from our own paper published in

1866 : · ' ... all the evidence at command tended to show that by an increased

exercise of muscidar power there was, with increased requirement for respirable

material, probably no increased production and voidance of urea, unless, owng to

excess of nitrogenous matter in the food, or a deficiency of available non-nitrogenous

substance, or diseased action, the nitrogenous constituents of the fluids or solids of

the body were drawn upon in an abnormal degree for the supply of respirable

material.'

     In conclusion, although I fully agree with Voit, Zuntz, Wolff, and others, that

there stiU remains much for both Chemistry and Physiology to settle iu connection
with these two questions of * The Sources of the Fat of the Animal Bodij ' and ' The
Origin of Muscidar Fower,' yet I think we may congratulate ourselves on the re-

establishment of the true faith in regard to them, so far at least as the most im-

portant practical points are concerned.

5. On a New Mode for the Purification of Sewage. By P. Spencb.

     The question of the disposal of sewage is still an unsettled one, and is becom-
ing daily more pressing.

To our large towns it  is now a     most  serious matter                                                          the  rivers  that flow  past

many of them are assuming the character of pestiferous sewers ; fish have ceased

to live in them, and are gradually dying out from others ; and, excepting where

to%vns are near the sea, the rivers will become nuisances to an extent that will be

unbearable.

Many schemes have been tried and some are now in operation, by which

sewage has been partially or completely purified ; filtration and irrigation can be
made to effect the object, but have chiefly been tested in small localities, and they

are, I believe, tacitly oiven up as applicable to large populations.
    Precipitation by lime is now practically the mode by which, not purification,

but partial clarification is conducted, and by which the demands of the law are

not met, but merely evaded. Dr. Angus Smith, one of the Government in-
spectors under the Rivers Pollution Act, gives as the result of many analyses of

lime-efiluents, that while the solid sludge of the sewage is precipitated and the

liquid is thereby clarified, it still contains nearly all the soluble putretiable matter,

and is really a very impure fluid.

Where, in addition to lime-clarification, subsequent irrigation with the effluent

is practicable, it is rendered nearly pure ; and where, in connection with lime, salts

of alumina are used in sufficient quantity, the water or effluent is pure, limpid in

appearance, free from colour, smell, and putridity.

Having been engaged for some years in producing, in a cheap form, a sulphate

of alumina suitable for purifying sewage, and which is at the present moment

used by nearly all who are purifying by alumina, I have necessarily had my

attention directed to tlie problem of the best mode of precipitation by which the

aluminous salt, which is still an expensive substance, coidd be economised, and the

sewage completely purified at the smallest cost. AVhere alumina is used various

other substances have been and are now used in connection with it ; these are blood,

clay, charcoal, iron salts, and other bodies of more or less efficiency: none of these

substances are, I belie'^e, essential to the process, and some of them are probably

useless.

Lime is in nearly all cases needfid to the efficiency of the aluminous salts,

excepting in those where the sewage is decidedly alkaline ; but as this condition

cannot be depended upon, it may be taken for granted that lime should always be

used.

    In the new scheme which I shall now describe, I commence on the basis of
the lime-process as now conducted, and assume that it is so far useful and is a

preparation for real purification, and I propose to take the effluent as it comes
                                   --

       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                   535

from that process, and by the use of a solution of alumina to effect its complete

purification.

     In operating upon this clarified lime-eflSuent, I find two great advantages, i he
first of these is that the effluent always contains a portion of lime in solution
eutficient to decompose the small quantity of aluminous salt which is required.

When this salt is added, the lime-effluent, invariably opalescent, generally

coloured, and never transparent, at once changes its appearance, the alumma in
precipitating unites Avith the albumen and colouring matters, and in a few minutes

coagulates and slowly descends, leaving the fluid transparent, colom-less, and free

from smell, this effluent or water being now fit for any purpose except potable

uses.                                                                           ..

The second advantage of this new process  is  that  the  precipitate                which con-

tains all the alumina of the salt used settles to the bottom of the tanks as a light
flocculent body, and can from thence be pumped up into suitable reservoirs, and

when we add to it the equivalent quantity of sulphuric or hydrocliloric acids re-

qiusite for combination, then in the cold and however largely diluted, all the
alumina is dissolved, and the same quantity of aluminous salt in solution is formed

as was originally used, and after allowing the very small quantity of coloured
albuminous residuum to subside, the solution is run into a new quantity of lime

effluent, thus using the alumina over and over again, and reducing the cost of the

aluminous compound to that of the cost of the acid needful for its resolution.

I have fully verified the facts that all the alumina is in these circumstances

thro-^vn down, and that when so precipitated it is again all dissolved without using

any excess of acid.
    The cost of the process is thus reduced to a very small sum when compared

with any mode of purifying now in use. WhUe nearly all the modes which really

purify are impracticable, the new plan only requires a small extension of the
apparatus where lime-clarification is adopted, and. that process has come largely

into use on the ground of its cheapness, while it is only a mitigation of a great

evil, yet its cost is not less than 50s. to 70s. for every million of gallons operated

upon, and some of those who are now doing their best with it are threatened with

prosecution and probably injunction.

    If the new process in such cases were added to it, I estimate that it would not

add more than one-fifth to their expenses, and I have no hesitation in giving the
assurance that nothing else in sewage-purification will be required when the plan

now proposed is fuUy carried out.

  1. On the Befraction-equivalent of Diamond and the Carbon Compounds.
                             By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.B.S.

     It was shown by Mr. Dale and the author, in 1863 (' Phil. Trans.' p. 317), tha.
the specific refractive energy of a substance was a very important property ; for it is
a constant, little, if at all, affected by changes of temperature, of aggregate condition

or, to a considerable extent, by chemical combination. It is the refractive index -- 1

divided by the density. It was originally reckoned, both for the theoretical limit of

the spectrum according to Cauchy's formula, and for Frauuhofer's lines B, F, & H.

But in all subsequent work, the author has calculated the specific refractive energy

--for the line A, as least affected by dispersion ( ^ -H- . For purposes of cal-
                                                                                                                                                                                            J

culation among compound bodies, it is more convenient to adopt what Landolt
terms the refraction-equivalent ; that is, the specific refractive energy multiplied by

(^'^>the atomic weight

     Uncombined carbon as found in diamond has a refraction-equivalent varying

from 4-85 to 5-18 ; the mean may be taken at 5-0. It has the same value in the

large majority of its compoimds, such as bisulphide of carbon, cyanogen, sugar,
tartaric acid, alcohol, and the whole of the ordinary bodies of the fatty acid series.

It was very early observed, however, that there were exceptions, and it is now

kno'WTi that the whole of the bodies belonging to the aromatic series, the terpenes,
the pyridine series of bases, cinnamyl compounds, and hydrocarbons which are
peculiarly rich in carbon, such as naphthalene, anthracene, &c., give an excessive
refraction. This peculiarity, so far as the aromatic bodies and naphthalene are
concerned, was sought to be explained in a lecture at the Royal Institution, in
March 1877, by the fact that the usual atomicity of the carbon is not satisfied, as
illustrated hj the graphic formulae usually employed for this class of bodies.

     Briihl has lately published a series of papers in which, by careful experiments,
he has confirmed and extended previous observations, and he endeavours to prove
that wherever there is a double carbon atom with bonds latent, the refraction-equi-
valent is raised by about 2-0. This view answers satisfactorily for the great aro-
matic group, for the allyl compounds, for picoline and its congeners, and for
amylene, the refraction-equivalent of which is 1-95 above the normal, although
the halogen compounds of ethylene, propylene, and amylene are normal. This
theory, however, does not seem equally adequate to account for certain other phe-
nomena. 1st. The e.ssential oils which belong to the C,oHjg or the Cj^H.^, group,
have a refraction which is neither 2 nor 4 above the normal, but somewhere be-
tween these numbers 2nd. The cinnamj'l compounds, such as the well-known
oil of cassia, have an abnormal refraction; cinnamene acetate, 0]qH,jO, has a
refraction of 85-0, which is 13'4 above the calculated amount, while its isomer,
phenyl-ethyl acetate, has only the excess of 6-6 which is usual in phenj-1 compounds.
·3rd. The hydrocarbons, which have a greater number of atoms of carbon than of
hydrogen, increase in refraction, with the excess of carbon, at a rate which is far
more rapid than the theory will admit of, as will be seen from the subjoined table,
in which the last column represents the excess of the refraction-equivalent over
that calculated from carbon = 5 and hydrogen = 1-3,

2. The Position of Agricultural Echication and Research in this Gauntry and

   on the Gontment of Europe briefly compared and considered. By J.

   Macdonald Cameeon, F.G.S., 8fc.

                                                   Part I.

      1. General View of Chemical Agricultural Education in this country and its

                                                                   hindrances.

     The unparalleled development of almost every branch of manufactures during
the past quarter of a century is mainly due to the desire which our manufacturing

Apopulation have shown to turn to account the discoveries of modern science.

striking instance of this development is found in the dyeing industry. Twenty-two

years ago plants, and in some instances animals, supplied man with all the colouring
matters necessary for his purposes, hut in 1855 Mr. W. H. Perldn, F.R.S., then

engaged in one of the laboratories of the Royal College of Chemistry, investigating
coal-tar residues, discovered that when these residues were submitted to certain treat-
ment they yielded a beautiful colouring matter which he named mauve, and which
could be used for dyeing textile fabrics. This discovery encouraged others to take
up the researches on the coal-tar colours, as they have been called, which in 1878
culminated in the manufacture of three and a quarter millions sterling worth of
these materials. Did our agricultural population but ha^e faith in what science

can do for them, and more readily accept its discoveries and conclusions, we should

hear less of depression, and protection would not be so often pointed to as the
haven of refuge for what I believe to be largely due to ignorance and incapacity.
Yet, in the face of agricultural apathy, chemists pursue their investigations, en-
couraged by the fact that they are increasing our store of knowledge, and that the
day is not distant when their work must be utilised.

     There are many reasons for this apathy and opposition to the chemist and his
work. 1st. Many of our past chemists lacked a knowledge of practical agriculture.
2nd. The farmer's ignorance of even the most elementary scientific principles in-
volved in his vocation. 3rd. The time necessarily taken up in making field and

other experiments from which to deduce principles for the future guidance of the

--farmer. 4th. The want of confidence between the chemist and the farnler the

farmer thinking that the chemist, when he suggests or assists him, does so with a

--view to some hidden advantage which may be detrimental to his (the farmer's)

interests this can only be obviated by a better knowledge of each other.

2. Farmers' Societies and Agricultural Education,

  We --have in Great Britain J omit Ireland in the following calculation as it is well
--provided with the means of Agricultural Education in round numbers 255 agricul-

tural societies ; and, if we except the good work done by the Royal and Highland

and Agricultural Societies, nothing has been done by these 255 societies to encourage

and develop scientific agriculture, if we except the prizes given at their respective

shows for cattle, breeding, feeding, &c., and a few other exhibits remotely related
Ato agriculture.
                  very different state of things obtains in Holland for example,

where the societies not only hold shows and give prizes, but grant annual subsidies

to teachers in elementary schools and other qualified persons to teach the principles

of agriculture to their pupils, and during the winter months to audiences chiefly

composed of labourers. And what is the residt ? In this country seven-eighths of

the farmers cannot tell the difference between soluble and insoluble phosphate, nor

between ammonia and nitrate of soda. In the majority of Continental countries

both farmers and laboiu'ers enter upon life with an intelligent grasp of the principles

involved in their daily work, with the inevitable result that the agricultural re-

sources of these countries are pushed to their utmost limit, and their surplus pro-

duce comes pouring in upon us, we wondering how they do it

                 3. Relation of Landed Proprietors to Agricultural Education,

     Tlie proprietors of the land ought to be most interested in its development, and
decidedly are to blame for not taking that lead which their social ppsition and
territorial influence entitle them to, in initiating every movement having for its
object the development of the soil-produce as well as the intelligence of their

tenantry. Had they done so the position of scientific agriculture would be a very

diflPerent one.

               Pakt II.

The facilities for acquiring a knowledge of Scientific Agriculture in this country,

--1. England:  and on the Continent.

     [a). The Eoyal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
     (h). The Science and Art Department, which encourages agricultural education

       in its usual way by payment on results and by summer courses of lectures

           to teachers,

     (c). The Wilts and Hants Agricultural College, Downton.
     This institution, recently established by Professor Wrighton, late of the Eoyal

Agricultural College, to supply to the southern counties education similar to that

at Cirencester.

     {d). The Laboratory of Agricultural Chemistry, 52 Lime Street, London, where

         a course of lectures -with laboratory practice is given in connection with
        agriculture, commencing in October annually.

  --2. Scotland

(a). The Chair of Agriculture in the University of Edinburgh, subsidized and
   supported by the Government and the Highland and Agricultural Society of

    Scotland.

(6). The North of Scotland School of Chemistry and Agriculture, Aberdeen,
   originally established in connection witli the Science and Art Department,
   but now developing into an independent institution which grants diplomas of
   its own.

--3. Ireland:

The Albert Institution, Glasne%'in, Dublin, and several other uistitutions of
   a kindred nature, besides about 240 institutions of less importance.

      Institutions which encourage Agricultural Education hy Subsidies and Prizes.

   --1. England:

     («). The Royal Agricultural Society's Examinations and Scholarships.
     This Institution encourages agricultural education by four money prizes of 25/.,
16/., 10/., and 5/., and ten scholarships of 20/., tenable for one year.
     (h). The Society of Arts, by means of examinations and prizes.

  --2. Scotland:

      Higliland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.
      Like its English neighbour, this Society supports agricultural education by

granting 150/. per annum to the Chair of Agriculture in Edinburgh University, 10/.

in prizes to the class, as well as granting ten bursaries of 20/. each, and five of 10/.
each.

   --3. Ireland:

     The Eoyal Irish Agricultural Society.
     As the lines upon which this society works are much the same as the English
and Scotch National Societies, I need not give any special account of its work.

State of Agricultural Education in thefolloiving Countries.

  --There is a most complete system of ag^ricultural education in the following

countries: Austro-Hungary, Belgium, Holland, France, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Italy, Switzerland, Germany.

     The system of agricultural education in Germany heing more complete than that

of the other Continental countries, I shall allude to it only.

     In the German Empire there are 17 High Schools, or Institutes, 31 Mddle,

--45 Lower, 49 Agrarian, 5 Meadow, 15 Horticultural, besides 1133 others such as
--Winter schools where the scientific principles of agriculture are taught.

     In addition to these schools there were in existence, at the close of 1878, 2,652

agricultural societies distributed over the German Empire, engaged in special agri-
cultural work, besides supporting agricultural education, All these schools have
experimental stations attached to them, where the theoretical principles expounded
in the class room and laboratory are verified in the field. They are partly subsi-
dized by the Government, and partly bv the provinces in which they are situated.

                  Agricultural Research in this Country.

1. General view of its position.

--2. Experimental stations.

(A). England:

(a). The Experimental Station at Rothamsted. Were it not for the great
   and important work done at this station by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, I fear
   that I shoidd have little to credit research with in this country. From 1847

   to 1880 inclusive, 51 original memoirs have been published on field experi-
   ments and experiments on vegetation, and 28 papers and reports on the

    feeding of animals, utilisation of sewage, &c.

(&). The experimental station of the Royal Agricultural Society at Woburn,
   Established in 1877 to test the value of unexhausted manures, &c.

--(c). The experimental station at Wickhurst Frant, Sussex established by the

   author in conjunction with the Tuubridge Wells Farmers' Club to inquire into
   the causes of the failure of the hop crop.

--{d). The experimental station at Oxon-Hoath, Tunbridge established by W.

   Nevili Geary, Esq., and the author for a similar purpose, and to check the
   results of the Aberdeenshire experiments with soluble and insoluble phos-

    phates.

(B). Scotland:--

(a). The experimental stations of the Highland and Agricultural Society at

 --Harelaw and Pumpherston established in 1877 for the purpose of obtaining

an answer to the various questions constantly croppmg up as to the money and

other value of the different manures used in raising crops.

(6). The experimental stations of the Aberdeenshire Agricidtural Association.

They are five in number, and were established in 1875 for the piu-pose of

   ascertaining the best manure for the turnip crop.

--(c). The experimental station at Ardross, Alness, Rosshire established by

K. J. Matheson, Esq., younger, of Ardross, and the author, to test the value

of the experiments made by the Aberdeenshire Agricultural Association,

under different climatic and sod conditions, and to extend scientific agriculture.

It being impossible, in a short abstract like this, to give even an idea of the

researches now being conducted in agriculture in the several Continental countries

myabove named, I must, therefore, refer persons interested in the subject to  paper

about to be published at length.

                  Concluding Remarks and Suggestions.

     Notwithstanding the apathy of tlie past, progress is certainly being made in

agricultiu-al education, and the desire for it is increasing.

540                         REPORT 1880.

In 1876, 150 candidates presented themselves for the Science and Art Depart-

whomment's certificate, of  9-4 per cent, failed.  In 1880, 3,062, or 200 times more,

presented themselves, and of these 21 '6 per cent, failed.

The Department should encourage the teaching of the principles of scientific

agriculture in elementary schools to a class composed of children in the last year

of their compidsory attendance ; and no teacher should be considered eligible for

such a position who has not the Department's Agricultural Certificate. Further,

there ought to be a central school in each parish, where the principles and practice

of agriculture should be taught. Such schools might, with good management, be

made almost self-supporting ; but if not, the deficiency should be made up partly by

the State and partly by the parish. Proprietors should take the lead in organising

committees to encovu'age popular lectures, and every eft'ort should be made by them

to increase our agricultural knowledge. Every restriction should be removed whicli

at present hampers production :' and with institutions to gviide our agricultural

population, such as I have endeavoured to sketch in the foregoing pages, the pro-

ducing powers of our soil woidd be considerably increased, as well as the intellec-

tual resources of those who till it, while, as a consequence, higher aims and aspira-

tions woidd be held out to the latter.

    In conclusion, I have to tender my most sincere thanks to Count Giovanni

Gigliucci, Lieut.-Ool. Donnelly, E.E. ; Professor Wilson, Edinburgh University ; the

Principal of the Roj-al Agricidtural College, Cirencester ; Dr. Gilbert, and other

gentlemen for statistical and other knowledge relating to this most important subject.

3. On the Specific Rotatory Foiver of Cane and Invert Sugar.
                       By Alfeed H. Allen, F.G.S.

    The angular rotation produced by a plate of quartz of 1 mm. in thickness is 24
degrees for the mean yellow ray or transition tint. In Soleil's polarising sacehari-

meter the 24 angular degrees are graduated into 100 divisions, and in using the
instrument, a solution of cane sugar is employed of such concentration that a column
of 2 decimetres in length shall cause a de^"iation of exactly 24 degrees, or 100

di^Tsions.

     If S be the apparent specific rotatory power of an optically active substance in

solution ; a the angular rotation observed ; I the thickness in decimetres of the

solution traversed by the ray of polarised light ; and c the number of grammes of
solid in each 100 c.c. of solution, the -salue of S can be fovmd by the folio-wing

equation :                ^S=

                          7 "^

                                            100

It is agreed by nimierous observers that the apparent specific rotatory power of

cane sugar in aqueous solutions, containing at least 10 per cent, of the solid, is

--+ 73-8° for the transition tint. Substituting this value for S in the above equation,

24° for a, and 2 for I, we obtain

              --1yo.g, 24
                                           T; whence c = 16-26.
                                                   2X
                                                        100

Hence the proper weight of sugar to be taken for use with Soleil's saccharimeter is

16-26 grammes, and not 16-19, 16-35 grammes, or any different weight. If it be

contended that either of these alternative quantities is the right one to employ, it

follows that + 73-8° is not the correct apparent specific rotatory power of cane

sugar.

    According to Tuschmidt, Casamajor, and many other observers, a solution of

cane sugar which, before inversion, shows a deviation of + 100 Soleil di\'isions,
gives after inversion a negative rotation of 44 divisions at 0° C, decreasing by 1

division for each rise of 2° 0., so that the inverted solution -will show a deviation of

- 37 at 14° C, and - 36-5 at 15° C.

Manj' writers on the rotatory power of invert si;gar have overlooked the fact

that inversion causes an increase in the weight of solid matter in the solution, 95

parts of cane sugar yielding 100 parts of invert sugar. This increase of weight

ought to be taken into account in calculating the specific rotatory power of invert

--sugar, which at 15° C. is really 25-6° :

                          ^ -86-5x __-24

                          ^ 16-26                :^5-^

                                                       95

This number corresponds to a value of -- 25-94° for Sj at 14° 0., instead of -- 25-0,

as generally stated. If 16-19 grammes be adhered to as the normal weight of

sugar per 100 c.c, the value of Sj at 14° C. becomes -- 26*05°, against -- 25-0° as

usually taken.

4. On the Identification of the Goal-tar Colours. By John Spiller, F.G.S.

Dyers and others who are in the habit of using the coal-tar colours are familiar

with a number of chemical reactions by which the members of the series may

generally be classified and identified. Diflerences are remarked in their relative

affinities for various sorts of fibres, some colours being taken up freely by silk,

others fixing better upon wool, and some few, like saft'ranin, exhibiting a special

affinity for cotton. Again, as with the yellows, great differences are observed when

the operator proceeds to work with a free acid or a weak alkali in the dye bath,

primrose (naphthalene yellow), requiring the former, but not so phosphine (cry-

saniline yellow), which demands a neutral or even slightly alkaline bath.

By the study of these conditions, aided by a few characteristic tests, it is often

possible to identify colouring matters of unknown or doubtful origin, and it is with

the \-iew of extending the number of such readily available tests that I recommend

a more frequent appeal to the colour-reactions with sulphuric acid.

For this purpose but small quantities of material are required, a few grains

serving to impart a distinct colour to a comparatively large bidk of sulphuric acid,

and the resrdting indications are in many cases both specific and permanent. Oil

of vitriol, which so readily destroys nearly all organic structures, does not carbonise

any of the coal-tar colours, or does so only under severe conditions, as at high

degrees of heat. Even indigo and madder, although of true vegetable origin, are

known to yield up their colouring matters to sulphuric acid, the old processes of

dyeing depending upon this fact. In the manufacture of garancine from madder

the woody fibre and organised tissues are destroyed by the action of sulphuric acid,

whilst the alizarin glucoside sur\-ives, and with it Turkey-red goods may be dyed.^

Instances might be midtiplied as proof that colouring matters, both natvu-al and

artificial, resist the attack of oil of vitriol, and the large class of sidphonates

(Nicholson blues, ' acid roseine,' &c.), may be cited as establishing the fact that

colouring matters are not so destroyed, but form combinations with sulphuric acid.

If, then, the body imder examination be dissolved in strong oil of vitriol, a

colour-test is at hand, whereby useful inferences may be derived as to the nature

Aof the dye, and often its exact identity disclosed.  few direct confirmatory tests

may then be applied.

The most remarkable colour-reactions are the following :

5. On the Density of Fluid Bismuth. By W. Chandler Roberts, F.B.S.,

                               and Thomas Wrightson, G.E.

     Some time since one of us described" the results of experiments made to de-

termine the density of metallic silver and of certain alloys of silver and copper

when in a molten state.^ The method adopted was that devised by Mr. R. Mallet/

and the details were as follows :

   A conical vessel of best thin Low-Moor plate (1 millimetre thict), about 16

centimetres hi height, and having an internal volimie of about 540 cubic centi-
metres, was weighed, first empty, and subsequently when filled with distilled water

at a known temperature. The necessary data were thus afforded for accurately
determining its capacity at the temperature of the air. Molten silver was then
poured iato it, the temperature at the time of pourmg being ascertained by the
calorimetric method. The precautions, as regards fiUuig, pointed out by Mr. Mallet,
were adopted and as soon as the metal was qviite cold, the cone vnth its contents

                                                                 ;

was agaiu weighed.
     Experiments were at the same time made on the density of fluid bismuth, and

two determinations gave the following results :

                    10-0051              meau,  1i0n"n0Qd9Q.

                    1 rj.Qyg \

     The invention of the oncosimeter ^ appeared to afford an opportunity for re-
simiing the investigation on a new basis, more especially as the delicacy of the
instrument had abeady been proved by experiments on a considerable scale on the
density of fluid cast-u'on. The following is the prmciple on which this instrument

acts :

     If a spherical ball of any metal be plimged below the siuface of a molten bath

of the same or another metal, the cold ball "will displace its own volume of molten

metal. If the densities of the cold and molten metal be the same there will be
equilibrium, and no floating or sinking effect will be exhibited. If the density of
the cold be greater than of the molten metal, there wiU be a sinking effect, and if
less a floating effect when first immersed. As the temperature of the submerged
ball I'ises, the volume of the displaced liquid will increase or decrease according as
the ball expands or contracts. In order to register these changes the ball is himg

on a spiral spring, and the slightest change in buoj'ancy causes an elongation or
contraction of this spring which can be read off on a scale of ounces, and is re-

of which represent increments of Tolume, or, ia other words, of weight of fluid

displaced, the zero line or line corresponding to a ball in a liquid of equal density

to that of the ball, being previously traced out hy revohiug the drum "wathout

attaching the ball of metal itself to the spring, but with all other auxiliary attach-

ments. By a simple adjustment the ball is kept constantly depressed to the same

extent below the surface of the liquid, and the ordinate of this pencil line, measiu"ing
from the line of equilibriimi, thus gives an exact measure of the floating or sinking

efiect.

     If the weight and speciflc gra\'itv of the ball be taken when cold, we then have

     The follo'^ving table shows the results of six experiments made by the authors
ia the laboratory of the Royal Mint. The bismuth was kept just above its melting
point, and this was ensured by placmg pieces of metal in the molten mass which

were observed just to melt.

are now profitably treated, all the metals being extracted in a marketable foi*m,
including zinc, which was previously entirely lost whenever the working of such
ores was attempted.

     The process is briefly the following : The ore, ha-ving been ground, is calcined

in a muffle furnace, so as to convert the sidphides of the various metals into sul-

phates and oxides. The sidphurous acid produced in this operation is conveyed to
leaden chambers for conversion to sulphuric acid in the usual manner. The cal-
cined ore is then agitated with weak sulphuric acid, which dissolves the zinc and
most of the copper, while all the lead, silver, and gold remain undissolved in the

residue. Sufficient hydrochloric acid is generally present in the sidphuric acid to
convert all the sulphated silver into insoluble chloride. Separation of the zinc

being then effected by lixiviation, the insoluble portion is smelted for the extrac-
tion of its metals in the usual way. The sulpliate of zinc liquor thus obtained
contains very little iron, provided the ore had been calcined sufficiently to convert

all the iron to peroxide. All the copper contained in the liquor is next

precipitated by metallic iron or zinc, after which tlie liquor is concentrated by
evaporation and mixed, when it begins to thicken, with a small quantity of finely
ground blende (1 eq. of sidphide of zinc to 3 eqs. of sulphate of zinc). After
further desiccation this mixture is heated to redness in a muffle furnace when
the sulphide and sidphate by mutual reaction become changed to oxide of zinc
and sulphurous acid gas (3 ZnSO^ + ZnS = 4ZnO and 4SO2). The former is in
a condition well adapted for the manufacture of spelter by distillation in the
usual way ; the latter is conveyed to leaden chambers for reproduction of sulphuric

acid.

    The conversion of sulphate of zinc into oxide of zinc may be effected by other-
reducing agents than blende. Coal and charcoal may be used for that purpose,

but as the sulphurous acid is then mixed with carbonic acid, it is not so well
adapted for conversion to sidphuric acid in the chamber process, as the gas de-
rived from the mixture of sidphate of zinc with blende.

    The operations here described are now being extensively carried on at the
works of the Swansea Zinc Ore Company, near Swansea.

     Another sulphate which is easily convertible into oxide in an analogous manner
is that of magnesia. Pure wood charcoal should be used as the reducing agent,
and the mixture heated to dull redness. The magnesia thus prepared corresponds
in density to the variety known as ' hea%^ ' calcined magnesia.

8. On a New Process for the Production., from Aluminous Minerals contain-
  ing Iron, of Sulphate of Alumina free from Iron. By J. W. Kynaston,

   F.C.8., FJ.G.

In this paper the author gives an account of an investigation undertaken for

the purpose of devising a means for the production, on a large scale, of sulphate

of alumina so pure that it may be used in the arts for all purposes for which pure

soluble alumina is required, and so to prevent the loss of the large quantities of

potassa or ammonia and sulphiu-ic acid requii-ed in the manufacture of the crys-

tallised alums.

He gives a historical statement of the methods in actual use to produce alum

substitutes, and of the attempts that have been made to utilise for this purpose the

newly-discovered rich aluminous mineral. Bauxite. The great difficidty in the

production of pure alumina salts from this mineral arises from the presence in the

ore of a comparatively large proportion of peroxide and some protoxide of iron,

which dissolves with the alumina when the ore is attacked with acids.

The author states that he has found that a solution of oxalic acid possesses the

power of dissolving the oxides of iron contained in Bauxite without materially

attacking the alumina, and gives in detail the mode of carrying out the operations,

together with the process adopted for recovering the oxalic acid employed for re-

peated use for the same purpose. He then states the difficidties in the practical

working of any process of purifying Bauxite from iron which involves the repeated

"washing of the ore, and goes on to describe some reactions which permit of the

separation of dissolved iron from aluminous solutions.

In a solution of alumina obtained by treating Bauxite with sulphuric acid,

there is contained iron to the extent of 0'80 to I'OO per cent., about three-fourths

of which exists as peroxide and the remaining one-fourth as protoxide. The iron

existing as peroxide is rendered insoluble, and precipitated from the solution by

converting it into arsenite by the addition of arsenious acid, and then, by means

of carbonate of lime, neutralising any free acid, and at the same time producing

in the solution a little tetrabasic sidpliate of aliunina. Under such circumstances,

the whole of the iron existing as peroxide falls out of the solution.

The remaining ferrous iron is then removed by the addition of ferrocyanide of

calcium, a reaction which, though so well known, has not hitherto been successfidly

appUed for the purpose, hj reason of the difficidty of separating the impalpable

precipitate of Prussian blue from the solution.

The author has found that the addition to the blue mixture of a mere trace of

either the sulphate of copper or of zinc, induces an aggregation of the previously

imponderable particles of Prussian blue, which then rapidly fall out of the solution.

This precipitate is collected and washed, and by treatment with lime the ferro-

cyanide of calcium is regenerated and again used to remove more iron.

    The solution of sulphate of alumina now freed from iron is lastly treated with

sulphide of calciiun to remove the excess of arsenic, and then boiled down until of

such a density that it solidifies on cooling. The residt is a sulphate of alumina,

neutral, practicall}^ free from iron, and containing about 16 per cent, of alumina,

as compared with 10'83 per cent, contained in the ordinary crystallised potash

alum.

   A description is then given of tlie mode of cari-ying out these reactions in the

actual process of manufacture as carried on at St. Helens, and, finally, attention is

drawn to the probabilitj' of an extensive consumption of sulphate of alumina, in

Athe future, in the process of refining beetroot sugar.                                              large quantity of potash is

contained in sugar from this source, and it prevents the crystallisation of much of the

sugar. It has been known for some jears that by means of sidphate of alumina

potash might be removed from the syrup, but the process has not been extensively

adopted by reason of the difficulty of obtaining sulphate of alimiina sufficiently

pure for the purpose.

9. Oh a New Process for separating Silver from Copper contained in
        Copper Ores and Begnluses. By "William Henderson.

The latest literature on this subject seems to award the palm of accuracy and

cheapness to Zeir-vogel, who proposes by calcidation of reguluses to form in the

first place sulphates of iron and copper which are gradually decomposed by further

calcination into the state of oxides, lea\"ing argentic sulphate, which stands a much

higher temperature undecomposed, and wliich is soluble in pure water.

     The difficulty always remains, in calcining reguluses or ores, to do it in such a
way as to convert the whole of the silver into sulphates. To ensure the result

with certainty I have called in the aid of a bisulphate, and I have taken bisulphate

of soda as the cheapest and as carrying a large proportion of available sidphuric

acid. The theory of the process is, that bisidphate of soda cannot be reduced to

sulphate by simple fusion, but parts with its second equivalent of sulphuric acid to

several metals at a comparatively low temperature. I thus ensure at once, and

early in the process, sufficient imprisoned sulphuric acid to make sure that the

whole of the .silver will be converted into sulphate at the end of the process after

the other metallic sulphates are decomposed.

     If the reguluses are comparatively free from arsenic and antimony the bi-

.sulphate may be at once mixed ^^'it'\l them, and the calcination proceed at once, as

in the Zeir-vogel process.

For several years I have again and again taken up this subject viathout suc-

cessful results                                                      at aU events the results were,  as a rule, imperfect  and no improve-
                                                                  ;

again attracted by tlie circumstance that some mines in Central Spain were offered

to me which produce copper ores rich in silver and a small quantity of cobalt, and

it was desirable if possible to demise some cheap and simple process whereby these

metals could be perfectly separated from each other.

   A series of experiments led to the adoption of bisulphate of soda for this pur-

pose, which gives for silver very perfect results with reguluses. I have not been so

successfid with ores, for obvious reasons.

Therefore, on November 3, 1879, I took out a patent, No. 4481 of that year,

* for treating certain ores and reguluses,' and I have since made a good many

experiments which, I regret to say, are principally crucible experiments, not having

at hand a.nj reguluses rich in silver to work with on a large scale.

   My last results are, however, so exact that I venture now to lay them before

the Chemical Section of the British Association.

The ore I liad to deal with was from Spain, and contained a very large

quantity of arsenic, the calcination of the ore leaving a loss of 28 to- 37 per cent.

    I found in my first experiments with this new process that both arsenic and

antimony \erj much interfered with the results obtained. I therefore continued

the calcination until I had arrived at what is technically known as calcined ' dead.'

My aim was to produce a regains of about 50 per cent, copper, and to accomplish

this I added a corresponding proportion of the ordinary Spanish pyrites, rich in

sulphur, and this produced a regulus containing not more than 1 per cent, of

arsenic, but contained besides a small quantity of lead which existed in the Spanish

ore I had to deal with.

The reguhis as produced gave 285 ozs. 16 dwts. 16 grs. of silver per ton of

regulus, and of copper 42 per cent.

In previous experiments I had come to the conclusion that, provided the

regulus did not contain much arsenic or antimony, as good and even better results

were obtained from the raw regulus. To test this, equal quantities of the same

-- --regulus 1st, calcined 'dead'; 2nd, half-calcined, 3rd, raw regidus each with

20 per cent, of bisulphate of soda, were added. The three crucibles were placed in

the same fi-e and calcined at a gradually increasing heat, and finished at a bright

red heat when gases had ceased to be given off. This occupied one hour and

twenty minutes. The results were as follows :

                                                                                ozs. dwts. grs.

Srd ,,                   ,, 0-8765             ,, =286 6 12

    This last result I consider very perfect, and I regret much that I have not been
in a position to place before you anything more than laboratory experiments.

3. On the Determination of the Loss of Heat in Steam-Boilers arising
         from Incrustation. By William Thomson, F.B.S.E.

On evaporating large quantities of water in small vessels I was surprised to find

that some samples evaporated away mucli more rapidly than others, although the

same sizes of  flames  were  allowed to play on the  bottoms of  each of  the vessels
                                                                                                                             ;

and I afterwards found that the rapidity of evaporation was in the inverse pro-

portion to the quantity of incrustation which had formed on the bottoms; I
was further impressed by the small quantity of incrustation which was required

to make a great difference in the quantity of water evaporated. Based on this

fact, I have constructed an apparatus in which four small vessels are set so that
the bottom of each dips into paraffin contained in a large vessel, heated by

one lamp from the centre ; by this means the same quantity of heat is given to

each vessel, and it is evident that on measuring the quantity of water evaporated

by each in a given time, the amount of heat lost by the incrustation may be

determined.

In the arrangement of this apparatus I use one of the small vessels to

evaporate pure distilled water, and the others to evaporate waters to be tested for
boiler purposes ; these samples are placed in flasks or vessels arranged mouth down-

wards, on Bischofl"'s principle, so that the water in the small vessels is always

kept at the same height until the whole in the flask is evaporated. When the

distilled water is evaporated to a certain point the operation is stopped, and the

amount of water left is in each case accurately measured. It is evident that the

quantities of the different samples which remain in excess of the distilled water
would represent in water the quantity of heat lost by the incrustation produced by

a given quantity of any sample.

4. On the Identification of the Inh used in ivriting Letters and Documents
    as Evidence in Cases of Libel, Forgery, ^c. By William Thomson,
     F.E.S.K

     Most of a large number of inks on envelopes sent to the author by different
persons, when tested by reagents, were found to differ from each other to a large
extent, whilst no two were precisely similar when minute compaiisons were made.

     The reagents which I have found to give best results are :

      1. Dilute sulphuric acid.

      2. Strong hydrochloric acid.

      3. Slightly diluted nitric acid.
      4. Sulphurous acid solution.

      5. Caustic soda solution.
      6. Cold saturated solution of oxalic acid.

      7. Solution of bleaching powder.

       8. Solution of protochloride of tin.

       9. Solution of perchloride of tin.

     As an example of the results produced by reagents, some inks when treated, for

instance, with sulphuric acid are changed to bright crimson, some to deep red,
whilst others become blue, green, violet, or grey, of different shades, and some
remain practically unaltered ; and when, as sometimes happens, the same or nearly
the same colour is produced by one reagent, the colours produced by others are

very different.

     By testing inks in this way on libellous letters, or in cases of forgery, the ink
may, under some combinations of circumstances, possess as much individuality

about them as the faces of their owners.
     I have found that the same ink when put on different kinds of paper gives pre-
--550 KEPORT 1880.

cisely similar results with reagents, and also that the same kind of ink made hy
the same maker at different times gives different residts.

     Lastly, persons treat and use inks so differently that although two persons may
he supplied with precisely the same ink, yet when it has been in use by them for
some time, the character of each may become diti'erent, being altered by the user

leaving his steel pen in the ink, or by leaving it exposed to the light, or by tilling
the bottle up with one kind of ink before another kind has been entirely tinished,
or by mixing with it fluids such as water, beer, wine, &c., when the ink is nearly
dried up. Thus, as most people have in their ink-bottles fluids which are very
characteristic, the testing of the ink on papers or documents to discover the writer

may become of the highest importance, although it is seldom that this mode of in-

vestigation is adopted.

            6. Note on Silver Sulphate. By Philip Beaham, F.C.S.

     The silver sulphate was shown as brilliant transparent crystals of regular octahe-
dral shape and of higli refractive power. They were produced hj pouring strong sul-

phmic acid on a plate of sUver, and adding a few drops of nitric acid. At first there
was a slight chemical action, bubbles of gas being liberated. In a day or two the

whole of the sulphuric acid acqiures a deep purple tint, probably due to the for-
mation of some oxide of nitrogen. After a lapse of two to three weeks the purple
tint sinks towards the silver, and a slight brown tint can be seen on the surface,
the layer of liquid above the silver being colourless. About this period long crj'stals
form, which re-dissolve, and the liquid becomes colourless. In the course of a few
days brilliant specks are seen, which develop into perfect crystals ; those shown
had taken over six months in forming.

    6. The Effects of Magnesia on Vegetatimi. By Major-General Scott,

                                                     C.B., F.E.S.

     Not among the least wonderful of the anomalies in the conduct of human beings
is the persistence, in opposition even to their own interests, with which they adhere
to a prejudice long after it has been overturned by experience. The erroneous
views of the effects of magnesia on vegetation afford a notable instance. Eminent

cultivators have given their testimony from actual practice of its favourable effects,
yet the prejudice continues so strong that farmers will often carry other limes

from a long distance, and at a much greater cost, rather than employ those made
from dolomite. Its slower absorption of carbonic acid, or some defect in the mode
of using it, had given in tlie first instance an unfavourable impression regarding
magnesian lime, and this impression has been handed down from one author to
another, and has been accepted by the unthinking agriculturist without question.
Instances occur even in which men of science have contributed to the propagation

of the error.

    Now and again there has been some slight protest against the assumption that

magnesian lime had qualities noxious to vegetation, but these protests have pro-

duced little effect, and the substance, though known to be an important constituent
of plants, has seldom been made a component of manures. Thus Professor Johnston
recommends the making of experiments both with caustic and mild or carbonate of

magnesia, and states, in 1849, that, ' in consequence of previous recommendations
it (carbonate of magnesia) has been tried in numerous experiments by Mr. Gardner
at Barochan in Renfrewshire, and by Mr. Main at Whitehill in Midlothian. This
was never applied alone by these gentlemen, but always as an ingredient of mixed
manures, in which it formed only a small proportion. These experiments, there-
fore, throw no light upon the special effects of this substance on our different crops
and soils.'

    Thirty years after this we stiU find Mr. Jamieson thus writing in the report of

the proceedmgs of the Aberdeenshire Agricultural Association for 1878. Speaking
                         TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                                                                  551

of the essential ingredients of plants, he says that they ' may benefit or injure plants

according to the combination in which they are  applied                                      thus chloride                                of   lime    and
                                                                                          ;

carbonate of magnesia are said to be plant-poisons, although composed of ingredients

which are beneficial in other forms, such as carbonate of lime, sulphate of magnesia,

chloride of potash, &c.' And again, ' As to magnesia, it may be put down quite as

a neglected substance in manures. Judging from examination of soils its appli-

cation is called for in many cases more urgently than most of the other essential
ingredients.' It is true also that Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert introduced 16-3 per
cent, of sulphate of magnesia ( = 2 per cent, of magnesia) into the mixed mineral

manures employed in their experiments at Eothamsted, and small quantities were

used in the trials of  manures made in  1841 and 1842  in                                    Scotland                                     but  one of  the

most eminent authorities on the question of manures, M. Yille, whose work has been

justly received with much appreciation by agriculturists in America and England

as well as in his own country, does not think it necessary to introduce magnesia

into manures at all, not because he does not consider it to be an essential element

in vegetation, but because, as he states, 'it is found in the soil ' 'naturally,' and of

coiu'se he means in sufficient abundance for tJie requirements of plants.

How far the accuracy of this opinion is borne out by the facts he cites is, I

think, open to question, and I therefore place the whole matter, almost in his own

mywords, before you, and it will form an appropriate introduction to                                                                      paper.

M. Ville gives in his work the analysis, by Da-^-y, of six samples of earth

from different sources, 'all renowned for their fertility,' and states that ' all six

possess the same degree of fertility.' Now Sir Humphry Da^'y, in his work on

Agricultural Chemistry, gives the analysis of three of them, and of these he says

that one was from a hop garden, another from a ' good turnip soil, and a third

from an excellent wheat soil.' In none of the six samples, excepting that from the

'hop garden,' did Sir Humphry Da\'y find any magnesia, and in that he found
·7 per cent, of magnesic carbonate ( = '33 magnesia). M. ViUe gives also the
analysis of a soil from Chalons-sur-Marne, by M. Rivot, which showed only traces
of magnesia. At the same time they contained, with one exception (which had

only '6 of calcic carbonate), a fair proportion of lime, viz. from 4-7 to 57 '2 of calcic

carbonate. It is true that in the days of Davy methods of analysis were not so
accurate as at present, and that magnesia might have been, and most probably
was, present in some of the five samples in which it was not detected or noted by

Idm ; but the magnesic element must have been present in insignificant proportion

in comparison with the calcic.

     At the end of his work M. Ville gives tables for calculating the relative exhaus-
tion of soils under different crops, but in these tables no mention whatever is made
of magnesia as an element abstracted from the soil by plants, though it is an im-

doubted fact that the seeds of peas, beans, rape, and wheat carry off" a comparatively

lai-ge proportion of it. In 100 parts of the seed crop of wheat there are 12 parts
of magnesia and onlj' 4 of lime, and in the straw of this plant the quantity of mag-
nesia is about one-half that of the lime, yet M. Ville omits magnesia from his normal

manure for cereals, though lime, in the somewhat soluble condition of sulphate, forms

nearly one-half of the whole compoimd recommended for a wheat crop. And this
fact appears the more remarkable when we examine the experiments made with

the different mineral elements of plants by M. ViUe. With reference to these

experiments, he says : ' This time a fixed and invariable q\iautity of nitrogenous

matter was mixed with the [calcined] sand [soaked with distilled water] as a

constant ingredient, and all the other mineral ingredients were added by turns
except one. The experiments were repeated as many times as there were different

mineral ingredients, in order that each might be excluded in its turn, the deviation
between the crops obtained with the ten mineral ingredients and those in which

they were reduced to nine, being taken to indicate the degree of importance of the

suppressed ingredients.

     ' Magnesia was submitted to the same method of exclusion. The defects were

as disastrous as in the case of potash.

     ' There are some plants, particularly buckwheat, on which the effects of this

Buppression are immediate ; on wheat they are manifested a little more slowly, but
are still very signiticaot, and when magnesia is excluded- from the soil the yield
falls to ahout 123 grains instead of 337.

  --' The suppression of the lime produces a less sensible effect the yield is then

my' Leaving the culture in calcined sand, I extended  investigations to various

natural soils.

' On submitting them to the same experimental system we found that ....

the yield is mamtained at the same level as when sulphur, silica, soda, magnesia,
iron, and chlorine are added, which explains to jou why I did not go further into

the effects of those bodies.

  --'Experience, therefore, shows that the four ingredients nitrogenous matter,
--phosphate, potash, and lime ai'e the onlv ones that need be admitted into manures.'

(ViUe, pp. 153-5.)

     'I give the name, therefore, of normal manure to the mixture of phosphate of

lime, potasTi, lime, and a nitrogenous material.

     ' In so doing, I do not intend to deny the utility of the other ingredients ; I
exclude them from the manure because the soil is provided with them naturally.

     ' If we pass from these fundamental data to the function of each mineral
ingredient in particular, the results are neither less expressive or less explicit. The

soil being provided with nitrogenous matter as a constant ingredient :

and pure soil gave better results than the pure soil, derogates little, if at all, from

the evidence of impro'\ement given by magnesia.

Again, Morton in his ' Encyclopaedia of Agriculture,' in opposing the erroneous

opinions current against the use of magnesian lime, mentions that ' In the neigh-

bourhood of CasteUamonte and Baldissiro, the most luxuriant vegetation is met

with on a soil which contains a very large quantity of magnesia, and in our own

coimtry many very fertile soils are fomid in the New Red Sandstone formation,

which likewise is rich in magnesia.'

John Donaldson, the author of a ' Treatise on Manures,' having been engaged

--in the cultivation of laud in the immediate neighbourhood of Breedon Magnesian

Rock in Leicestershire, says : ' I had occasion to use considerable quantities of lime,

and consequently had a fair opportunity of proving the quality of that rock for

agricultural purposes.' On two fields (the farm he tells us had been most miserably

scourged and impoverished by the preceding tenants) he spread the magnesian lime

at the rate of 200 bushels an acre, and in another field ' a double allowance of lime,

or 400 bushels per acre .... which, being both a large quantity and in a caustic

state, would test the supposed noxious quality of the lime. In every case the green

crops were good ; . . . one field was sown with barley, which yielded a most

beautiful crop of 7-k quarters per acre, and the other produced 5 quarters of wheat,

both very great crops when the exhausted state of the land was considered.
    When the wheat braided in November, the space which had got 400 bushels

to an acre immediately showed a great superiority, which continued to the day of
reaping, being much thicker on the groimd, of a darker colour throughout the

winter, and afforded more produce as the shocks were thicker on the ground, and

discernible on the first view of the field. The succeeding crop of hay on that space

showed an equal superiority, and for several years in succession.

     ' The same lime was used in the same quantity, of 200 bushels to an acre, and
with the same beneficial results, without a single exception. On the headland where

the lime lay, and where any damage might have been expected, there grew a very
close and heavy crop of beet, with roots not equalled in size and weight. Many

eminent cultivators join in the same opinion of magnesian lime deriA'ed from actual

Apractice.' (' Treatise on Manures,' by J. Donaldson, pp. 157-8.)

     This experiment is very instructive and conclusive, for on comparing the results

obtained with the constituents of each of the various crops, it will be observed that

the beneBcial results were in proportion to that of the magnesia which the ash

contains. Though the green crops were good, it is specially mentioned by Donaldson

that the space which had the double allowance of magnesian lime 'showed no

difference in the turnip crop.'

    The following table, extracted from ' How Crops Grow ' (Eng. ed. by Church

and Dyer), gives the percentage of magnesia and lime in the ashes of the crops

alluded to :                                     Uagnesia          Lime

We here see that Donaldson's results are exactly in accord with what would

have been predicted from a consideration of the mineral constituents of the different
crops. The turnip, containing the smallest proportion of magnesia, is not benefited

by tlie presence in the soil of a double proportion of that substance; probably the

200 bushels to the acre of Breedon lime supplied quite enough lime and more
magnesia than was necessary for that crop : but in the case of wheat, where for
the formation of the seed a Aery large supply of magnesia was necessary, the dose

of 200 bushels to the acre was insufficient to enable the roots to find the requisite

amoimt of magnesia for the fuU development of the crop, and yet, if, in this
matter, we are to follow-M. Ville's prescription, all the soils naturally contain enough
                                                                                     --

magnesia to supply all the wants of wheat, though analysis shows the presence of

mere traces of it only, or none at aU. Mr. N. Whiteley, land surveyor, the author

of a treatise ' On the application of Geologj' to Agriculture,' whilst recei^-ing as

well founded the common prejudice against the magnesian lime in its hot state,

Hedoes full justice to the fertilising eifects of magnesia in its mild condition.  says,

speaking of land near St. Ke^ern, in Cornwall : ' If we seek for a soil theoretically
perfect it may be found in this formation. The large amoimt of magnesia which

this fruitful soil contains (9 per cent.) is worthy of observation.' Of the magnesian
limestone formation he saj^s that ' much of it is thin, light, and dry,' and ' we are

prepared therefore to meet with a soil of medium quality ; miich of the soil on the

magnesian limestone is in arable culture, but from Standrop to Darlington the soil

may be considered the best and richest grazing land in the North.' Strong con-
firmation of the views I am seeking to establish is to be derived from a considera-

tion of the cases of soils, which are either abmidantly supplied with, or are very

deficient in magnesia.

In the following table are given the proportions of lime and magnesia found in

both fertile and barren soils. 1 give the lime as well as the magnesia, because that

substance is considered, very lightly, a most important ingredient of manures,

although usually its proportion in soils is considerably in excess of the magnesia:

556 REPORT-- 1880.

    To pursue this subject further in tlie direction indicated by Liebig is a task for
which 1 feel myself unequal ; but it encourages me to examine narrowly the records

of experiments in which magnesia has been made an element of mamu'es, or has

been tried alone, or in conjunction with an acid.

    Of experiments made with magnesia alone I know of no further instances of a

definite and reliable  kind  than those of Donaldson, above quoted                                                                                                                                                     but  concerning
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

experiments with sulphate of magnesia, both alone and combined with other con-

mystituents, there are records to which I can refer for further proof of                                                                                                                                                    argument.

Before doing so, however, I wish to call attention to a fact which has a con-

siderable bearing on the case. Both Liebig and Ville hold that farm-yard manure

--excellent manm-e as it is must be supplemented with mineral substances if full

value is to be given to it, and that additional phosphoric acid is necessai-y to make

all of its nitrogen available for plant life. Now, in 100 parts of farm-yard manure

there is less than -14 per cent, of magnesia, and of its mineral constituents the

magnesia forms only 1'7 per cent. Donaldson tells us 'the quality of earthy

composts and of farm-yard manure is prodigiously improved by a mixtui-e of

seaweed. . . . During the seasons of the seaweed coming on shore the farmers

have heaps of dimg or soil in readiness to receive the immediate benefit of the

" vrrack," and these heaps, along with any lands which may be in a state fit to

receive it, afford a ready application of this invaluable article. Farm-yard manui-e

for turnips is improved by it almost beyond description, and never fails to vindicate

the expectations of its effects.' (Donaldson, p. 12.3.)

    Now, what are the components of the ash in seaweed ? No less than from 7

to 20i per cent, of magnesia are fomid in different kinds of it, and the ashes of the

seaweed at the mouth of the Mersey contain upwards of 15 per cent. No doubt

in the growth of the turnip crops the advantage is largely derived from the great

amount of potash the seaweed contains, but of this substance the ash of dung itself

j-ields upwards of 9 per cent., whereas it yields only, as stated, 1'7 per cent, of

magnesia. In the asli of dung, therefore, i                                                                             ~^ =  ; in that of the turnip

turnip, if manured with seaweed as well as dung, derives more of the benefit from

the magnesia added by the seaweed, than from the potash thus supplied.

   We will now proceed to examine some of the experiments made in 1842, and

reported by Professor Johnston, wliich have been already briefl}' referred to.

Sidphate of magnesia, 1 cwt

Here 1 cwt. of sulphate of magnesia alone gives an increase of upwards of from
12 to 30 per cent, (mean, 21 per cent.) ; but as the sulphate of magnesia was not
tried in duplicate, less reliance can be placed on this experiment.

     These results are very interesting. It might be supposed that the increase in the'
crop -was due to the sulphuric acid, and not to the magnesia ; hut, inasmuch as
sidphate of soda gave no advantage, the effect is plainly not due to the sidphuric

acid, unless we suppose the soda to have been injurious, which is not likely to have

been the case. An increase of sulphate of magnesia appears also to improve the
crop. When 1^ cwt. of the salt was used, as a top dressing, with the diuig, the

increase was only 4 per cent. ; but when 2 cwt. was used with the dung, at the
time of planting, the increase was close upon 80 per cent. The result of this ex-

periment appears, moreover, to confirm the view that the mixture of the ashes of
sea-weed and dung derives no unimportant advantage from the quantity of magnesia

thus introduced into the plant.

Here the use of li cwt. of sidphate of magnesia gave the enormous increase of

increase of 60 per cent. only. It will be of interest at this pomt to refer to the
composition of the mineral constituents of the tvu-nip, potato, clover, and hay, as

respects the proportions in them of lime and magnesia, for we shall then see that

mthe advantage gained by the crops experimented on has been general accordance

with what might have been expected from the components of their ashes. I have

given also the percentage of sulphuric acid for reasons stated below.

phate of magnesia, as shown hy these experiments, was :

If this coincidence is accidental it is extraordinary. Another point to which I

wish to call attention is the fact that the advantage gained is manifestly largely

due to the magnesia,  and not to the sidphuric  acid   only                         for where the advantage
                                                                                 ;

was the greatest by far, the sulphate of lime did not produce an equivalent effect,

though the 3 cwt. of calcic manure carried to the soil upwards of six times the

amoimt of sulphuric acid that the li cwt. of the magnesic salt supplied, and

though the latter is far more soluble than the former, gypsum is sufficiently soluble

for all the requirements of plants.

   A third point remains for remark, and that is the relative effect produced on

potatoes in the above experiments of Mr. Fleming, of Barochan, by the use of dimg

No. 1, of sulphate of magnesia No. 2, of sulphate of soda No. 3, of nitrate of soda

ANo. 4, and of a mixture of nitrate of soda and sulphate of magnesia No. 5.

comparison of these residts can leave little doubt in the mind of the immense value

of magnesia as an ingredient of a manure for potatoes. By the addition of 2 cwt.
of sulphate of soda to the dmig no advantage was gained ; when 1^ cwt. of nitrate

of soda was added to the dimg, the extra supply of nitrogen in its nitric acid
increased the produce 30 per cent. ; but when 1 cwt. of sulphate of magnesia was

added to the dimg, together with 1 cwt. only of nitrate of soda, the amount of
produce rose upwards of 76 per cent, upon what was given by dimg alone. More-

over, it is quite clear that as the li cwt. of nitrate of soda alone gave an increase of

only 30 per cent., and when sulphate of magnesia was added to the manui-e, the

nitrate at the same time being reduced by 50 per cent., the produce rose to 76 per

cent., more than one-half of the advantage was due to the sulphate of magnesia.

I have before showai and my conclusions are confirmed bj' these experiments, that

the benefit is chiefly attributable to the magnesia, and not to the sidphuric acid

combined with it. mthThere is, indeed, one other possible supposition at ^'ariance

this conclusion, ^i7.. that the Ih cwt. of nitrate of soda was too large a quantity to

use per acre ; iDut all experience contradicts this idea.

     The followiag are the results recorded by Professor Johnston of the experiments
on cereals, as far as they affect our investigation. The quantities of manure and

the crops are, per acre :

As the above crops were not the same, and the quantities of manure emploj^ed

differed and were applied at difl'erent times, no exact results maybe deducible from

the above trials ; but as the experiments were all witli cereals, we are able to draw

general conclusions from them, which are not unimportant, as to the effects of

magnesia as a manure, and

  --First. As sulpliate of soda, when used alone, proved in each case prejudicial,

we may assume that at least it did not materially assist the result when mixed w'ith

--rape dust or sulphate of magnesia.
    Secondly. As rape dust, when used aloue, gave orAj a certain increase to the

crop, any further increase when used with sulphate of magnesia must be due to

tlie influence of the latter substance, and

   --Thirclhj. As rape dust used aloue with oats decreased the crop of grain 16-6 per

cent., and with spring wheat only increased the crop of grain by 7 per cent., whereas
when used in conjunction with 84 lbs. only per acre of sulphate of magnesia
( = 13'6 lbs. of magnesia), as a top dressing with winter wheat the increase rose to

--nearly 16 per cent., it is reasonable to suppose that some portion indeed a con-
--siderable portion was due to the influence of the sidphate of magnesia, small as it

was, and not to the rape dust as a single agent. So far as the rape dust improved

the result it may be supposed to be attributable to the influence of the magnesia,

to which substance Liebig, as we have seen, assigns a very definite part in the

formation of the seed.

mmdIt must be borne in          in considering the question, how far a soil is likely to

be improved by an increase of the amoimt of magnesia in it, that crops remove

from the soil the greater portion of then- mineral constituents within a short space

of time as compared with the whole duration of the existence of the plants, and

that, therefore, it must be of the greatest moment that they should be able to

gather them from the soil within this period. A.fter a certain time a cultivated

plant advances little in size and weight, although great changes occur in the dis-

tribution of its constituents.

    Liebig says, with manifest truth: 'As a soil may contain far more potash, or
map-nesia, or lime than the crop may require, yet, being diffused through a large

--quantity of earth, the roots may be unable to collect the ingredients fast enough to

supply the growing wants of the plant to such a soil it will be necessary to add

a further portion of what the crop requires.'

The last experiments to which I shall refer are those of Dr. Pincus, of Insterburg,

which Liebig characterises as most important, both on account of the careful manner

in which they were conducted and the conclusions drawn from them. Three plots

of ground were selected lying close together, each of about five-eighths of an acre ia

extent, from the middle of a large clover field. The clover crop had a very promising

appearance and the plants were then about one inch high ; one of the plots was
manured with 1 cwt. of gypsum, the second with the same quantity of sulphate of

magnesia, and the intervening plot was left immanured. When all were in flower

--the clover was mown, and the following were the results :

Without manure                                       Per f acre.

....With gypsum (sulphate of lime)                  , 2r6

                                                        32"4

Or the gain with the use of the magnesic salt as a manure was just 50 per cent.

It is to be observed that the stems were developed by both the sulphates much
more than the leaves and flowers. The experiment also showed that there was no

proportion between the quantities of sulphuric acid found in the crops and in those
supplied by the two sulphates. The quantity of sulphuric acid in the two sulphates
was 31-12 lbs. in the sulphate of magnesia, and 44-18 in the sulphate of lime, which
is about 6 : 8-8. The quantities of sulphuric acid in the two crops obtained severally
by sulphate of lime and sulphate of magnesia were as 6 : 8 ; and on the plot manured

with sulphate of magnesia, which had received less sulphuric acid than the gypsum
plot, the amount of vegetable matter was 8 per cent, higher than on the latter.

     Liebig, from experiments made on arable soils, came to the conclusion that

dressing a field with sulphate of lime makes the magnesia in the soil soluble and
                                           --

--560 REPORT 1880.

distributable. An experiment made to test this conclusion showed tliat the contact

of arable earth with the solution of sulphate of lime is attended by an actual sub-
stitution of magnesia for lime. If this notion be correct, it points to a cheaper
mode of supplying magnesia to the soil than to add sulphate of magnesia to manures,
for it follows ithat the use of gypsum in conjmiction with comparatively small doses
of magnesian lime will effect all that is necessary in cases in which heavy carriage
interferes with the use of an abundant supply of that substance.

     In conclusion, though any one of the above proofs of the value and importance

of magnesia in a manure may not carry conviction with it, yet taken altogether the
evidences are overwhelming against the notion that soil naturally contains so much

magnesia that an extra supply will be of little or no benefit. Moreover, there are

strong grounds for supposing, as we have already indicated, that magnesia, like

phosphoric acid, is not only an essential ingredient of plants, and aids in their
nutriment, but that it determines also the beneficial action of the other ingredients.

   7. On the Action of Oils on Metals. By William H. Watson, F.G.8.

     Beferring to a previous paper read by him at the last Plymouth meeting, on
the action of oils on copper, the author now makes the comparison between the
action of various oils on copper and on iron, and shows that they act very diffe-

rently on the two metals. He finds in several instances that those oils which act

little on copper act proportionately greatly on iron, while those which act little on
iron act greatly on copper. Thus linseed and olive oils, which act the most on

copper, act much less than either sperm or colza on iron. Almond oil also acted

very slightly on iron (in fact, with the exception of paraffin and the special lubri-
cating oil, it had the least action of any of the oils examined), but on copper the
action was great.

     Five hundred-grain measures of each oil were poured over a piece of bright
sheet iron, exposing 8 square inches of surface. After being kept thus exposed in
beakers during twenty-four days, the appearances weie noted and determinations
made of the iron in the oils, with the following results :

tliis damage to the goods, perceived hy the former, arises from small hubbies of

chlorine gas, as he determined by direct experiment that muslin in a wet condition

could be submitted to chlorine gas for a considerable period without imdergoing

sensible alteration                                                                                     but he believed  that there  existed                                            in  the  insoluble portion of
                                                                                                     ;

the bleaching powder of commerce a basic compound of imknown composition, and

that to this compound the destruction of the fibre was due. In proof of this, he

mentions that on washing a sample of bleaching powder till he could no longer

detect any bleaching agent, he obtained a residue containing more or less lime and

carbonate of lime, and on the addition of hydrochloric acid to this residue there

was evolved a most energetic oxidising agent. He also relates that, on spreading

this residue on woven fabrics, and afterwards passing these fabrics through an acid

solution, holes were produced in them in many places. Now, as these statements

of Persoz are considered correct by many eminent chemists, though they have, as

far as could be ascertained, not been veriBed, and as they are, if correct, of serious

importance to the bleacher. Professor Lunge suggested the advisability of submit-

ting the matter to careful investigation, and with that object a series of experiments

was undertaken, the results of which are here described :

The investigation was divided into several parts.

(1 .) Coidd bleaching powder be deprived by washing with cold or tepid water

of its power to act on iodine and                                                                                        starch paper                                                   and if so, how much water is
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

required for a definite weight of powder ?

(2.) What is the percentage of residue after the complete extraction of the

bleaching agent ?

(3.) If the residue in which iodine and starch paper failed to detect any bleach-

   ing agent would evolve any oxidising body on the addition of an acid ?

(4.) What is the effect of the residue with the addition of an acid on textile

fabrics ?

(5.) ^Vhat is the percentage of chlorine left in the residue of bleaching powder
   which has been dissolved for the preparation of a bleaching solution by Irish
   bleachers, and what effect has this residue with and without an acid on

fabrics ?

     The apparatus employed for the solution of the first question were merely (1st),
glass funnels, into which fitted small cones of De La Rue's parchment paper, over'
which were placed cones of Swedish filter paper ; the funnels were now attached^
to Bunsen's filter pump bottles, and the filter paper allowed to become thoroughly
dry (2nd) newly-prepared iodine and starch paper.

     Three samples of bleaching powder having been reduced to a uniform degree of
fineness were examined for the percentage of chlorine, vnth the following results :

The sample No. 3, which contained such a high percentage of chlorine, was pre-
pared by a student of Professor Lunge's, and an account of its manufactui-e will, I
believe, after some time be published.

     Having weighed carefully 10 gi-ammes of each sample, they were placed in the
funnels, and 100 c.c. of distilled water, at 15° C, was poured over each. The pumps
were then set in action, and when all the water had completely passed through,
each filtrate was examined for chlorine by Penot's arsenious acid process, after
which the filter bottles, having been thoroughly washed and dried, another 100 c.c.
of distilled water was added to each 10 grammes, and the pumps again set in action.
This operation was repeated until each sample had been washed with 600 c.c. of
distilled water, and though the filtrates still gave a most decided reaction with the
iodine and starch paper, almost all the chlorine had been washed out, as can be
seen by the following table :

vary largely with each sample, as is to be expected ; indeed, so largely did they

diverge from one another, that no definite percentage could be given as likely to
exist in a partially washed sample of bleaching powder. The samples which were
examined in this investigation ranged between 22 and 30 per cent. The percentage
of residue in the completely washed samples did not show such a large variation.
In the particidar samples, the percentage of chlorine in which is given above, there

was found in the English sample 8-1 per cent, residue, in the Swiss sample 7'9 per

cent. And an examination of various samples of bleaching powder of different

strengths showed that the percentage only varied between 7 per cent, and 9 per

cent.

    The remaining part of this investigation presented many difficulties. The residue,

which had failed to give a reaction with the iodine and starch solution, together
with acetic acid, when dried, certainly did evolve, on the addition of a few drops of
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, a most minute quantity of a bodj' which slightly

acted on wet iodine and starch paper ; but so small was the quantity of this body
which could be obtained, though several pounds of residue were experimented with,

that no correct idea of its nature could be formed ; but the results of the numerous
experiments made with it went to prove that it is not a basic clilorate, as stated by

Persoz, but simply a trace of a soluble hypochlorite which escaped being removed

from the residue by washing.

   mMany attempts were made to estimate, the completely washed residue, this

trace of a bleaching agent, in a manner similar to that adopted for its estimation in

the partially washed residue, but without success.

    As to Persozs statement that, when the residue is completely deprived of its

bleachuig power, and then spread over woven fabrics in such a manner as to find

its way into their interstices, if the fabrics be then submitted to a bath of hydro-

chloric acid, so energetic is the gas evolved from this supposed basic chlorate, that

--the fabrics are burnt into holes in many places ; this statement, so far as these

experiments go, is certainly without foundation, though the residue was tortured

in every conceivable manner in the endeavour to detect in it anj' body capable of

injuring textile fabrics. Among the experiments made with it, the following are

a few :

   A1st. certain weight of the residue was mixed with just sufficient water to

allow it to penetrate through the fabric being experimented with ; this mixture
was then pasted on one end of a piece of fine unbleached cotton. The same weight

of a mixture of lime and carbonate of lime as of the residue was mixed with the

same quantity of water, and then pasted on the other end of the piece of cotton.

The cotton was now set aside until the residue and lime mixture had dried on it,

after which, by means of a fine dropping tube, the same quantity of a normal hj'dro-

chloric acid solution was pom-ed over the residue and lime mixture, and when all

effervescence had ceased, a few drops more acid were added, and the piece of cotton

allowed to rest for some time, after which it was washed ; and on examination the

--result was found to be the same with the lime as with the residue both ends of

the cotton were slightly yellow, but in no way bleached or damaged.

This experiment was repeated many times in various ways, and with a variety

of fabrics, such as unbleached linen, blenched linen, calico, and cotton printed with

fugitive colours                                                             but though the unbleached linen  and cotton were boiled in  a  solu-
                                                                          ;

tion of tlie residue, and then passed through an acid bath, no more effect could be
perceived than when a piece of the same goods was boiled in a solution of the same

quantity of the mixture of Ihue and carbonate of lime, and then passed through the

acid bath. In case it might be considered that boiling had a neutralising eflect oa

any basic chlorate existing in the residue, various pieces of different fabrics were

allowed to steep in a solution of the residue for over a week, and then placed for

several hours in an acid bath, without being in the least degree injured. "When

the fugitive colour on the printed calico was not altered by lime, neither was it

affected by the bleachmg powder residue. In order to correctly investigate the

remaining question, queries were addressed to several of the best known proprietors

of Irish linen bleach-greens, as to the exact method adopted by them for the manu-

facture of the hypochlorite of lime solution, and also the quantity of water used to

                                                                             2

wash a certain weight of powder. From the answers received, it was ascertained

that no general rule was followed, everyone doing what he considered best for his

purpose                                  but it  was  considered                                                       probable  that  the  damage  to  fabrics  noticed  by
                                      ;

Persoz arose from minute particles of unwashed, or imperfectly washed, bleaching

powder finding their way into the interstices of the fabrics, which aftei-wards had

been so imperfectly washed that when they were passed through the acid bath an

energetic bleaching agent was evolved, and so the fabric was destroyed. To deter-

mine whether this was likely to be the case, bleaching powder was dissolved, and

the residue washed in the manner adopted at one of the largest greens in Ireland

and in the residue thus prepared, pieces of linen and cotton were steeped for twentj'-

four hours, after which they were found to be stiU sound, but decidedly altered in

colour, and after being passed through an acid bath, both samples were of that

shade of colour known in the trade as a ' low cream.'

On washing bleaching powder according to the manner adopted at several

greens, and then estimating the chlorine remaining in the residues, it was found to

7vary from -2 per cent, to per cent. ; and from these figiu-es and the above experi-

ments there can be no doubt but that the damage, if any, arises, not from a basic

chlorate, but from a number of infinitesimal particles of 'the undissolved bleaching

powder becoming lodged in the interstices of the fabrics ; and, of course, those parts

where they were lodged would require a great deal more washing than the remain-

ing portions of the fabric                                                                                             and if, either by carelessness or any other cause, the goods

happened to be imperfectly washed, then, when soured, they would not unlikely be

damaged in the parts containing the undissolved particles by the evolved gas, while

the remaining portions would be imaltered.

In conclusion, I must take this opportunity of thanking Professor Lunge, under

whose supervision these experiments were carried out, for the many valuable sug-

gestions which he was kind enough from time to time to make.

THURSDAY, AUGUST 2Q.

The President delivered the following Address :

In selecting a subject for an address to be given in accordance with the custom of

my predecessors, I was anxious that it should he, iu some way or other, connected

with the locality in which we have met. If I had been adequately acquainted with
the district, I should have thought it incumbent on me to give such an outUne of

the general geology of the surrounding country as would have been useful to those
attending this meeting. I am, however, practically a stranger to South Wales,

and must therefore leave that task to others. On reflecting on the various subjects
to which I might have called your attention, it appeared to me that I could select
one which would be eminently appropriate in a town and district where iron and

copper are smelted on so large a scale, and, as I think, also equally appropriate

from a geological point of \iew. This subject is the comparative structure of artifi-

cial slags and erupted rocks. In making this choice I was also influenced by the

fact that in my two anniversary addresses as President of the Geological Society

I have recently treated on the structure and origin of modern and ancient stratified

rocks, and I felt that, if in the present address I were to treat on certain pecu-

liarities in the structure of igneous rocks, I should have described the leading

conclusions to which I have been led by studying the microscopical structure of

nearly all classes of rocks. It would, however, be impossible in the time now at
disposal to treat on all the various branches of the subject. Much might be said

on both the purely chemical and purely mineralogical aspects of the question ; but
though these must not be ignored, I propose to draw your attention mainly to

another special and remarkable class of facts, which, so far as I am aware, have
attracted little or no attention, and yet, as I think, would be ver}- instructive if we

could fully understand their meaning. Here, however, as in so many cases, the

observed facts are clear enough, but their full significance somewhat obscure,

owing to the want of adequate experimental data or sufficient knowledge of general

physical laws.

    A considerable amount of attention has already been paid to the mineral con-

stitution of slags, and to such peculiarities of structure as can be learned indepen-

Adently of thin microscopical sections.  very complete and instructive work,

specially devoted to the subject, was published by Von Leonhard about twenty-two

years ago, just at the time when the microscope was first efficientlj' applied to the

study of rocks. Since then Vogelsang and others have described the micro-

scopical structure of some slags in connexion with their studies of obsidian and
other allied volcanic rocks. At the date of the publication of Von Leouhard's

work the questions in discussion diflered materially from those which should now

claim attention. There was still more or less dispute respecting the nature and
origin of certain rocks which have now been proved to be truly volcanic by most

unequivocal evidence ; and I am not at all surprised at this, since, as I shall show,

there is such a very great difference in their characteristic structure and that of the

artificial products of igneous fusion, that, but for the small portions of glass inclosed

in the constituent crystals, described by me many years ago under the name of
566  '  KEPOET-- 1880.

' glass-cavities/ there would often he no positive proof of tlieir Igneous origin.
There was also considerable doubt as to the manner in which certain minerals in
volcanic rocks had been generated. The observed facts were sufficient to prove
conclusively that some had been formed by sublimation, others by igneous fusion,
and others deposited from more or less highly heated water ; but it was difficult or
impossible to decide whether in particular cases certain minerals had been formed
exclusively by one or other process, or sometimes by one and sometimes by the
other, or by the combined action of water and a very high temperatiu"e. I must

confess that, even now that so much may be learned by studying with high magni-
fying powers the internal structure of crystals, I should hesitate very much in
deciding what were the exact conditions under which certain minerals have been
formed. This hesitation is probably as much due to inadequate examination and
to the want of a complete study of typical specimens, both in the field and by

means of the microscope, as to the unavoidable difficulties of the subject. Such
doubt, however, applies more to the origin of minerals occurring in cavities than

to those constituting a part of true rock-masses, to which latter I shall almost

exclusively refer on the present occasion. In the formation of these it appears to

me that sublimation has occurred to a very limited extent. In many cases true
igneous fusion has played such a leading part that the rocks may be fairly called
igneous, but in other cases, water, in some form or other, has, I think, had so much
influence that we should hesitate to call them ir/neous, and the term erupted would

be open to far less objection, since it would adequately express the manner of
their occurrence, and not commit us to anything open to serious doubt.

    In studying erupted rocks of different characters, we see that at one extreme they

are as truly igneous as any furnace-product, and, at the other extreme, hardly, if
at all, distinguishable from certain deposits met with in mineral veins, which
fiu-nish abundant evidence of the preponderating, if not exclusive, influence of

water, and have very little or nothing in common with products certainly known
to have been formed by the action of heat, and of heat alone. Between these

extremes there is every connecting link, and in certain cases it is almost, if not

quite impossible to say whether the characteristic structiu-e is due more to the
action of heat than of water. The great question is, whether the presence of a

small quantity of water in the liquid or gaseous state is the true cause of very well-
marked differences in structure ; or whether greater pressure, and the necessarily

slower rate of cooling, were not the more active causes, and the presence of water
in one state or another was merely the result of the same cause. This is a question
which ought to be solved by experiment ; but I fear it would be almost impossible
to perform the necessary operations in a satisfactcny manner.

     What I now propose to do is to describe a particular class of facts which have
lately attracted my attention, and to show that the crystalline minerals in products
known to have been formed bj' the action of heat alone, have a certain very well-
marked and characteristic structure, which is gradually modified as we pa^ss

through modern and more ancient volcanic to plutonic rocks, iu such a manner as to
show at once that they are intimately related, and yet differ in such characteristic

particulars that I think other agencies than mere heat must have had great

influence in producing the final result.

      In dealing with this subject, I propose, in the first place, to describe the

characteristic structure of products formed artificially under perfectly well-known
conditions, and then to pass gradually to that of rocks whose origin must be
inferred, and cannot be said to have been completely proved.

                                                Crystalline BloiD2npe Beads.

     Some years ago I devoted a considerable amount of time to the prepai'ation and

study of crystalline blowpipe beads, my aim being to discover simple and satis-

factory means for identifying small quantities of different earths and metalHc
oxides, when mixed with others ; and I never supposed that such small objects
would throw any light on the structure and origin of vast masses of natural rock.

AThe manner in which I prepared them was as follows : small bead of borax was

80 saturated with the suhstance under examination at a high temperature, that it

became opaque either on cooling or when slowly re-heated. It was again fused so

as to be quite transparent, and then very slowly cooled over the flame. If pro-

perly managed, the excess of material held in solution at a high temperature

slowly crystallised out, the form and character of the crystals depending on the

nature of the substance and on the presence of other substances added to the bead

as test reagents. By this means I proved that in a few exceptional cases small

simple solid crystals are formed. More frequently they are compound, or occur

as minute needles, but the most characteristic peculiarity is the development of

complex skeleton crystals of extreme beauty, built up of minute attached prisms, so

as to give rise to what would be a well-developed crystal with definite external

planes, if the interspaces were all filled up. In many cases the fibres of these

skeletons are parallel to three different axes perpendicular to one another, and it

might be supposed that the entire skeleton was due to the growth of small needle-

shaped crystals all uniformly elongated in the line of one crystalline axis, so that

the resulting  mass would be optically and  crystographically complex                                                                                                                          but in some
                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

cases the different systems of fibres or needles are inclined obliquely, and then the

optical characters enable us to prove that the separate prisms are not similar to

one another, but developed along diflfereut crystalline planes, so as to build up one

definite crystal, mechanically^complex, but optically and crystallographically simple,

or merely twiuned. In a few special cases there is a well-pronounced departure

from this rule, and truly compound groups of prisms are formed. In the centre

there is a definite simple prism ; but instead of this growing continuously in the

same manner, so as to produce a larger prism, its ends, as it were, break up into

several smaller prisms, slightly inclined to the axis of the first ; and these secon-

daiy prisms, in like manner, break up into still smaller, so as ultimately to give

rise to a curious complex brush-like growth, showing in all positions a sort of fan-

shaped structure, mechanically, optically, and crystallographically complex.

    I have done my best to describe these various kinds of crystals seen in blowpipe

beads as clearly as can be done without occupying too much time, but feel that it

is impossible to make the subject as simple as it really is without numerous illus-

trations. However, for the purpose now in view, it will, I trust, suffice to have

established the fact that we may divide the crystals in blowpipe beads into the

following groups, which on the whole are sufficiently distinct, though they neces-

sarily pass one into the other.

1. Simple crystals.                         3. Fan-shaped compound groups.
2. Minute detached needles.                 4. Feathery skeleton crystals.

     It must not be supposed that crystals of one or other of these groups occur
promiscuously and without some definite relation to the special conditions of the
case. Veiy much depends upon their chemical composition. Some substances
yield almost exclusively those of one group, and other substances those of another,
whilst in some cases a difference in the rate of cooling and other circumstances

give rise to variations within certain limits; and, if it were possible to still
further vary some of the conditions, these limits would probably be increased.
Thus, for example, the earliest deposition of crystalline matter from the glassy
solvent is sometimes in the form of simple solid prisms or needles, but later on in
the process it is in the form of compound feathery tufts ; and if it were possible to

cool the beads much more slowly whilst they are very hot, I am inclined to

believe that some substances might be found that in the early stage of the process
would yield larger and more solid crystals than those commonly met with. This
supposition, at all events, agrees with what takes place when such salts as potas-

sium chloride are crystallised from solution in water. Some of my blowpipe beads
prove most conclusively that several perfectly distinct crystalline substances may

be contemporaneously deposited from a highly heated vitreous solvent, which is an
important fact in connection with the structure of igneous rocks, since some
authors have asserted that more than one mineral species cannot be formed by the
slow cooling of a truly melted rock. The great advantage of studying artificial

blowpipe teads is that we can so easily obtain a variety of results under conditions
which are perfectly well known, and more or less completely under control.

                                                                  Artijici(tl Slags.

     I now proceed to consider the structure of slags, and feel tempted to enter into
the consideration of the various minerals found in them which are more or less

perfectly identical with those characteristic of erupted rocks ; but some of the
most interesting, like the felspars, occur in a well-marked form only in special
cases, where iron ores are smelted with fluxes seldom, if ever, employed in our

Myown country, so that my acquaintance with them is extremely small.

attention has been mainly directed to the more common products of our blast-
furnaces. On examining these, after having become perfectly familiar with the

 structure of blowpipe beads, I could see at once that they are very analogous, if

not identical in their structure. In both we have a glassy solvent, from which
crystals have been deposited ; only in one case this solvent was red hot, melted

borax, and in the other glassy, melted stone. Thus, for example, some compounds,
like what I believe is Humboldtilite, crystallise out in well-marked solid crys-
tals, like those seen occasionally in blowpipe beads, whereas others crystallise
out in complex feathery skeletons, just like those so common in and characteristic

pf the beads. In both we also often see small detached needles, scattered about

in the glassy base. These skeleton crystals and minute needles have been de-
scribed by various writers, under the names, crystallites, belonites, and trickites.

Though we have not the great variety of different forms met with in the beads,
and cannot so readily vary the conditions under which they are produced, yet we

can, at all events, see clearly that their structural character depends both on their
chemical constitution and on the physical conditions under which they have

crystallised. None of my microscopical preparations of English slags appear to

contain any species of felspar, but several contain what I believe is some variety of
augite, both in the form of more or less solid prisms, and of feathery skeletons of
great beauty and of much interest in connection with the next class of products to
which I shall call your attention, viz., rocks artificially melted and slowly cooled.

                                             Hocks artificially melted.

     I have had the opportunity of preparing excellent thin microscopical sections of
some of the results of the classic experiments of Sir James Hall. I have also

carefully studied the product obtained by fusing and slowly cooling much larger

masses of the basalt of Rowley, and have compared its structure with that of the
original rock. Both are entirely crystalline, and, as far as I can ascertain, both
are mainly composed of the same minerals. Those to which I would especially
call attention are a triclinic felspar and the augite. The general character of the
crystals is, however, strikingly different. In the artificial product a considerable
part of the augite occurs as flat, feathery plates, like those in furnace slags, which
are quite absent from the natural rock, and only part occurs as simple solid

crystals, analogous to those in the rock, but much smaller and less developed. The

felspar is chiefly in the form of elongated, flat, twinned prisms, which, like the
prisms in some blowpipe beads, commence in a more simple form and end in
complex fan-shaped brushes, whereas in the natural rock they are larger than in

the artificial, and exclusively of simple character. On the whole, then, though the

artificially melted and slowly cooled basalt is entirely crystalline, and has a mineral
composition closely like that of the natural rock, its mechanical structure is very
different, being identical with that of blowpipe beads and slags.

                                                                Volcanic Hocks.

     Passing now to true natural igneous rocks, we find some, like obsidian, which

closely correspond with blowpipe beads, slags, and artificially melted rocks, in
having a glassy base, through which small crystalline needles are scattered ; but
the more completely crystalline volcanic rocks have, on the whole, a structure
               TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                     569

very characteristically xinlike tbat of the artificial products. I have most care-

fully examined all my sections of modern and ancient volcanic rocks, but cannot

find any in which the augite or magnetite is crystallised in feathery skeletons. In

the case of only one single natural rock, from a dyke near Beaumaris, have I

found the triclinic felspar arranged in just the same fan-shaped, brush-like groups

as those in similar locks artificially melted and slowly cooled. The large solid

crystals in specimens from other localities sometimes show that towards the end of

their growth small flat prisms were developed on their surface, analogous to those

first deposited in the case of the artificial product. In slags composed almost ex-

clusively of what I believe is Humboldtilite, the crystals are indeed uniformly as

simple and solid as those in natural rocks, but the examination of difl'erent blow-

pipe beads shows that no fair comparison can be made between altogether different

Wesubstances.  must compare together the minerals common to the natural and

the artificial products, and we then see that, on the whole, the two classes are only

just distinctly connected by certain exceptional crystals and b}' structural cha-

racters which, as it were, overlap enough to show that there is a passage from one

type to the other. In the artificial products are a few small, solid crystals of both

augite and a triclinic felspar, which closely correspond to the exceptionally small

crystals in the natural rocks ; but the development of the great mass of the

crystals is in a difl'ereut direction in the two cases. In the artificial products it is

in the direction of complex skeletons, which are not seen in the natural rock ; but

in the natural rock it is in the direction of large simple solid crystals, which are

not met with in the artificial products. There is a far closer analogy in the case

of partially vitreous rocks, which, independent of the true glassy base common to

them and the artificial products, often contain analogous crystalline needles. Even

then, however, we see that in the artificial product the crystals tend to develop

into complex skeletons, but in the natural rocks into simple solid crystals.

It must not be supposed that these facts in any way lead me to think that

thoroughly crystalline modern and ancient volcanic rocks were never truly fused.
The simple, large, and characteristic crystals of such minerals as augite, felspar,

leucite, and olivine, often contain so many thoroughly well-marked glass en-

closures, as to prove most conclusively that when the crystals were formed they

were surrounded by, and deposited from, a melted glassy base, which was caught
up by them whilst it was still melted. This included glass has often remained
unchanged, even when the main mass became completely cn'Stalline, or has been

greatly altered by the subsequent action of water. I contend that these glass

enclosures prove that many of our British erupted rocks were of as truly igneous

origin as any lava fiowing from a modern volcano. The difference between the

mystructure of such natural rocks and that of artificial slags must not, in   opinion,

be attributed to the absence of true igneous fusion, but to some difference in the

surrounding conditions, which was sufficient to greatly modify the final result,
when the fused mass became crystalline on cooling. The observed facts are clear

enough, and several plausible explanations might easily be suggested, but I do not

feel at all convinced that any single one would be correct. That which first
suggests itself is a much slower cooling of the natural rocks than is possible in the

case of the artificial products ; and I must confess that this explanation seems so

plausible that I should not hesitate to adopt it, if certain facts could be accounted

for in a satisfactory manner. Nothing could be more simple than to suppose that
skeleton crystals are formed when deposition takes place in a hurried manner, and

they so overgrow the supply that they develop themselves along certain lines of
growth before there has been time to solidly build up what has been roughly

sketched in outhne. I cannot but think that this must be a true and, to some

extent, active cause, even if it be inadequate to explain all the facts. What
makes me hesitate to adopt it by itself is the structure of some doleritic rocks
when in close contact with the strata amongst which they have been erupted.
In all my specimens the effects of much more rapid cooling are perfectly well

marked. The base of the rock when in close contact is sometimes so extremely

fine-grained tbat it is scarcely crystallised, and is certainly far less crystalline and
finer grained than the artificial products to which I have "called attention, and yet
570 EEPORT-- 1880.

there is no passage towards those structures which are most characteristic of slags,

or at least, no such passage as I should have expected if these structures depended

exclusively on more rapid cooling.

   We might well ascribe something to the effect of mass, hut one of my speci-

mens of basalt melted and slowly cooled in a small crucible is quite as crystalline

as another specimen taken from a far larger mass, though I must confess that what

difference there is in this latter is in the direction of the structure characteristic of

natural rocks. The presence or absence of water appears to me a very probable
explanation of some differences. When there is evidence of its presence in a

liquid state during the consolidation of the rock we can scarcely hesitate to con-

clude  that it must  have had  some active influence                                                                                                  but in the  case of true volcanic
                                                                                                                                                   ;

rocks the presence of liquid water is scarcely probable. That much water is

present in some form or other, is clearly proved by the great amount of steam

given off from erupted lavas. I can scarcely believe that it exists in a liquid

state, except at great depths, but it may possibly be present in a combined form

or as a dissolved vapour under much less pressure, and the question is whether
this water may not have considerable influence on the growth of crystals formed

prior to eruption, before it was given off as steam. I do not know one single

fact which can be looked upon as fairly opposed to this supposition, and it is even

to some extent supported by experiment. M. Daubree informs me that the

crystals of augite formed by him at a high temperature by the action of water

have the solid character of those in volcanic rocks, and not the skeleton structure

of those met with in slags. The conditions under which they were formed were,

however, not sufficiently like those probably present during the formation of

erupted lavas to justify om- looking upon the explanation I have suggested as

anything more than sufficiently plausible, in the absence of more complete ex-

perimental proofs.

                               Granitic Mocks.

    I now proceed to consider rocks of another extreme type, which for distinction
we may call the gi-anitic. On the whole, thej- have little or nothing in common

with slags, or with artificial products similar to slags, being composed exclusively

of solid crystals, analogous in character only to slag-crystals of veiy different

mineral nature. As an illustration, I would refer to the structure of the products

formed by fusing and slowly cooling upwards of a ton of the syenite of Grooby,

near Leicester. Different parts of the resulting mass differ very materially, but

still there is an intimate relation between them, and a gradual passage from one to

the other. The most characteristic feature of those parts which are completely

crystalline is the presence of beautiful feathery skeleton-crystals of magnetite, and

of long flat prisms of a triclinic felspar, ending in complex, fan-shaped brushes.

There are no solid crystals of felspar, hornblende, and quartz, of which the natural

rock is mainly composed, to the entire exclusion of any resembling those in the

melted rock. As looked upon from the point of view taken in this address, the

natural and artificial products have no structural character in common, so that I

think we must look for other conditions than pure igneous fusion to explain the

Wegreatly modified results.    have not to look far for evidence of a well-marked

difference in surrounding circumstances. The quartz in the natiu-al rock contains

vast numbers of fluid-cavities, thus proving that water was present, either in the

liquid state or as a vapour so highly compressed that it afterwards condensed into

an almost equal bulk of liquid. In some specimens of granite there is indeed clear

proof that the water was present as a liquid, supersaturated with alkaline chlorides,

like that inclosed in the cavities of some minerals met with in blocks ejected from

Vesuvius, which also have to some extent what may be called a granitic structure.

In the case of one very exceptional and interesting granite, there is apparently

--good proof that the felspar crystallised out at a temperature above the critical

point of water that is to say, at a temperature higher than that at which water

--can exist as a liquid under any pressure and it caught up highly compressed

steam, comparatively, if not entirely, free from soluble salts ; whereas the quartz

crystallised when the temperature was so far lowered as to be below the critical

                                                                                                                               _

clilorides, wliicli have crystallised out as small cubes in the fluid-cavities, just as in

the case of minerals in some of the blocks ejected from Vesuvius.

    Confining our attention, then, to extreme cases, we thus see that rocks of the

granitic type difier in a most characteristic manner from the products of artificial
igneous fusion, both in the structure of the crystals and in containing liquid water,
inclosed at the time of their formation. The question then arises, whether these
differences were due to the presence of the liquid water, or whether its presence
and the characteristic structure were not both the effects of the great pressure of

Buperincumbent rocks. I do not see how this can be decided in a perfectly satis-
factory manner, but must confess that I am inclined to believe that, wliilst great
pressure was necessarily the reason why the water did not escape as vapour, the

presence of liquid water during final consolidation must have had a very consider-
able influence in modifying the structure of the rock, and had a great share in

developing what we may call the granitic type.

     It would be very instructive to follow out the gradual passage from one

extreme type to another far more completely than is possible on the present
occasion. The most interesting examples of rocks intermediate between the

granitic and volcanic types that I have been able to examine in adequate detail,
are the various Comish elvans and other quartz felsites, which furnish all but a

complete passage from pitchstone to granite. Some specimens prove that quartz
may crystallise out from and inclose a perfectly glassy base, without a trace of
liquid water ; and at the same time other specimens prove equally well that, as we
approach the granitic type, the quartz was not deposited from a glassy solvent, but
inclosed more or less water. In the few intermediate cases there appears to be

evidence of the conjoint presence of uncombined water and melted stony matter.

On the whole, if we take into consideration only the external form of the larger
crystals, rocks of the granitic type are very much as though the crystals met with

in trulj^ volcanic rocks had been strained out from the glassy or fine-grained base,
and the intermediate spaces filled with quartz. The internal structure of the
crystals is, however, very different, the cavities in one class containing glass, and

in the other water. This most essential and characteristic difl'erence proves that
rocks of the true granitic type cannot have been formed simply by the more com-
plete crystallisation of the general base of the rock. If the crystals in granite were

analogous to those developed in volcanic rocks, and the only essential difl'erence

was that the residue crystallised out more slowly and completely, so as to give

rise to a more coarsely crj-stallised base, the crystals first formed ought not, as I
think, to differ so essentially as that in one case they should inclose only glass, and

iu the other only water. Taking all into consideration, we can therefore scarcely

suppose that the crystals in granitic rocks were deposited from a truly-melted, dry,

glassy solvent, like those in volcanic rocks or in slags.

                               General Remits.

I have, I trust, now said enough to show that the objects here described may

be conveniently separated into three well-marked groups, viz., artificial slags,

Myvolcanic rocks, and granitic rocks.        own specimens all show perfectly well-

marked and characteristic structures, though they are connected in some cases by

intermediate varieties. Possibly such connecting links might be more pronounced

in other specimens that have not come under my notice. I must, however, base niy

conclusions on what I have been able to study in an adequate manner, by examining

my own preparations, and leave it for others to correct any errors into which I may

have been led from lack of more numerous specimens. In any case the facts seem

abundantly sufficient to prove that there must be some active cause for such a

common, if not general, difference in the structural character of these three difierent

types. The supposition is so simple and attractive, that I feel very much tempted

to suggest that this difierence is due to the presence or absence of water as a gas

or as a liquid. In the case of slags it is not present in any form, Considering how

large an amount of steam is given oft' from erupted lavas, and that, as a rule, no

fluid-cavities occur iu the constituent minerals, it appears to me very plausible to

suppose that those structures which are specially characteristic of volcanic rocks
are in great measure, if not entirely, due to the presence of associated or dissolved
vapour. The fluid-cavities prove that water was sometimes, if not always, present

as a liquid during the consolidation of granitic rocks ; and we can scarcely hesitate

to conclude that it must have had very considerable influence on the rock during
consolidation. Still, though these three extreme types appear to be thus charac-
terised by the absence of water, or by its presence in a state of vapour or liquid, I

think we are scarcely in a position to say that this difference in the conditions is more
than a plausible explanation of the differences in their structure. At the same time,
I do not know any facts that are opposed to this conclusion, and we should,

perhaps, not greatly err in thus correlating the structures, even though the water
was not the essential and active cause of the differences.

     Confining our attention to the more important crystalline constituents which are

common to the different types, we may say that the chief structural characters of

the crystals are as follows :

                                                     a. Skeleton crystals.

                                                 b. Fan-shaped groups.

                                                            c. Glass-cavities.

                                                  d. Simple crystals.

                                                           e. Fliud-cavities.

Tiiese different structural characters are found combined in dilFerent ways in the
different natural and artificial products ; and for simplicity I will refer to them by
means of the affixed letters.

    The type of the artificial products of fusion may generally be expressed hj a + b

or b + c, that is to say, it is characterised by skeleton crystals and fan-shaped groups,

or by fan-shaped groups and glass-cavities. In like manner the volcanic type may

be expressed occasionally by b + c, but generally by c + d; and the granitic by
d+e. These relations will be more apparent if given in the form of a table,

as follows :

                        Slagtype . . { "^l^^

     Volcanic type .                                                                                                                        .|                ^^ ,
     Granitic type .                                                                                                                        ..
                                                                                                                                                           . d + e.

     Hence it will be seen that there is a gradual passage from one type to the other
by the disappearance of one character and the appearance of another, certain
characters the meanwhile remaining common, so that there is no sudden break,

but an overlapping of structural characteristics. It is, I think, satisfactory to find

that, when erupted rocks are examined from such a new and independent point of
view, the general conclusions to which I had been led are so completely in accord

with those arrived at by other methods of study.

                                                                                                                                            Conclusion,

And now I feel that it is time to conclude. I have necessarily been compelled

to give only a general account of the subject, and perhaps, for want of adequate

description, many facts may appear more complex than they really are. Some are,

indeed, of anything but simple character, and their full explanation is, perhaps,

beyond our present power. The greater part are, however, much more simple

and easy to observe than to describe ; and, even if I have failed to make every-

thing as plain as I could wish, I hope I have succeeded in maldng the principal

point sufficiently clear to show that the structure of slags and of analogous artificial

products throws much light on the structure and origin of the various groups of

erupted rocks. I feel that very much still remains to be learned, and, as I think,

could be learned, by the further extension of this method of inquiry. What

strikes me most is the great necessity for the more complete application of experi-

mental methods of research                                                                                                          but to  carry out the  experiments necessary to  clear up

In the meantime all that we can do is to compare the structure of known artificial
products with that of natural rocks, and to draw the best conclusions we can from

the facts, as viewed in the light of our present knowledge of chemistry and physics.

My own impression is that there is still much to be learned respecting the exact

conditions under which some of our commonest rocks were formed.

2. Notes on the Submarine Geology of the English Channel off the Coast of

     The author described and exhibited hand specimens of the large detached blocks
of serpentine, gabbro, conglomeratic grit, granite, hornblendic granite, and other
gi'anitic or gneissic rocks that are occasionally trawled by the Brixham fishermen

m the English Channel, oft' the southern headlands of Devonshire. From the fact

that the nearest known rocks on the north-west are the gneisses of the Eddj-stone,
and those on the north and north-east are the micaceous slates of the Start and
Bolt district, it would seem probable that the detached blocks indicate similar rocks

in sitit, and that they are not erratics.

                  By Professox' W. Botd Dawkins, M.A., F.B.S.

      Caves in limestone are to be looked upon as subterranean watercourses, which
are produced partly by the dissolving action of the carbonic acid in the rainwater,
and partly by the mechanical action of the streams flowing through the caves. The
insoluble carbonate of lime in the rock is changed into the soluble bi-carbonate, and
is carried away in solution. The additional atom of carbonic acid, however, is in a
condition of unstable chemical combination, and if it be removed, either by evapo-
ration or by the action of the free current of air, the insoluble carbonate of lime is
at once deposited. Hence it is that some caverns have their walls covered with a
drapery of stalactite, and the little straw-like pendants from the roof formed round
the edges of each drop gradually become developed into columns of various sizes.
The stalagmitic pedestals also rise from the floor where a line of drops falls from

the roof, and ultimately unite with the column let down from above. On the

surface, too, of the pools an ice-like sheet of stalagmite gradually shoots across
from the sides, and sometimes, where the water is still, covers the whole surface.

Admirable illustrations of all these processes are to be seen in the caves of Pem-
brokeshire, and especially in the Fairy Cave on Caldy Island.

     The rate of the accumulation of carbonate of lime, depending primarily upon the
access of water and the free access of air, both being variable, varies in diff'erent
places. Sometimes it is very swift, as for example in the Ingleborough Cave ',
where a series of observations by Professor Phillips, Mr. Farrar, and myself, extend-
ing over the years from 1845 to 1873, give the annual rate at '2946 inch. It is

obvious, therefore, that all speculation as to the antiquity of deposits, in cases

which are based on the view that the accumulation is A'ery slow, are without value.
     The narrow mountain-limestone ravines and passes are to be viewed, in the

main, as caverns formed in the manner above stated, which have lost their roofs
by the various sub-aereal agents which are ever at work attacking the surface

 4. On the site of a Palceolithic Implement Manufadonj, at Crayford, Kent.
                               By F. C. J. Spureell, F.G.8.

     The remains exhibited were found by Mr. Spurrell in March last in the chalk
pit half a mile north-east of Orayford Church. The flakes and bones associated
with them were found under a deposit of brick earth, lying against an ancient chalk
cliff of the river Thames, about forty feet below the present surface of the ground.

     They consist mainly of waste flakes, flakes used at the broad end, an imfinished
hache, cores, and stones employed as hammers. From the fact that the edges are
sharp, that the chips belonging to individual blocks of flint lie together and can be
joined to one another, and that they lie in a layer together with the finest chippings
scarcely mixed with the sand, it is clear that the work was carried on where the

debris lay.

     The blocks of flint were derived from the weathering of the chalk cliff", and
were not mined ; they were of a very inferior quality ; and probably it is to this
piece of luck, and the consequent excess of waste material, that the find was not

overlooked.

     Portions of the bones of mammoth, tichorliine, rhinoceros, horse, &e., lay
amono- the flakes and immediately upon them, and present the appearance of having

been broken by man--perhaps for food.

from which it was seen that Griffiths' and Jukes' classifications were essentially
similar while Professor Hull's was materially different ; the difference being greater

than at first appears from the nomenclature employed.

    He pointed out that the supposed hiatus rested on the statements of Professor

Hull all of which were reviewed. The _first series of statements was that the
hiatus in the neighbourhood of Kenmare and Glengariff bays was found by Messrs.

O'Kelly and McHenry ; but the first of these geologists contradicts this, while the
second declined to give an opinion. The author then pointed out that the Glengariff
section in which this ' great hiatus ' is said to exist, was Jukes's type section, to
which he brouo-ht Professor Ramsay and Salter on their visit to the country, and
by which he taught bis assistants, Messrs. Foot, O'Kelly, and the author, the
classification of the West Cork rocks. The second series of statements was con-

cernino- well-known unconformabilities ; but as these are outside the limits of the

area occupied by the West Cork rocks, they prove nothing in connection with
them. The third set of statements was that the plotting of the folded and flexuous
strata proved unconformabilities. These the author showed to be only conven-
tional lines, which are explained by the published sections and writings of Jukes
and his coUeao-ues. The fourth statements were abrupt changes from one of
Professor HuU'l groups to the others. This the author showed could not be
correct as the Carboniferous slate graduated so imperceptibly into the Yellow
Sandstone, and the latter into the Old Red Sandstone, that the respective boundaries

are most arbitrary, and depend only on the colours of certain beds.

6. Note on the Range of the Lower Tertiaries of East SuffoUc.

 By W. H. Dalton, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England.

The Crags and Drifts of East Suffijlk prevent more than an approximate delinea-

tion of the outcrop of the Chalk from beneath the Lower Tertiary beds.

The London Clay disappears from the         surface  a   little west  of  Orford                                   but the
                                                                                                                ;

deep boring at Sir E. Lacou's brewery in Yarmouth, made in 1840, passed through

170 feet of estuarine deposits, and then no less than 305 feet of London Clay and

51 of Reading Beds before reaching the Chalk. There could therefore be hardly a

doubt of the continuity of the Eocene beds between Orford and Yarmouth, although

their boundary-line might be for some part of its length outside of the present

coast ; indeed, in published maps, most of the interval is coloured as Chalk.

     The inhabitants of Suffi:>lk are, however, awaking to the disadvantages of a
water-supply derived from ponds and sewage-tainted sands, and consequently
Artesian wells, carried down into the Chalk, are increasing in number.

The accounts of these wells (which will duly appear in the Memoirs of the

Geological Survey) give the following indications of the position of the outcrop of

the Chalk :--

At Easton Park, Framlingham, Beccles, and Norwich, the Chalk is covered

directly by Crag or Drift.

    At Woodbridge, Saxmuudham, Bramfield, and Yarmouth a greater or less
thickness of Lower Tertiary beds is present, and their boundary is probably three or

four miles inland from these points.

    At Hoxne, a few feet of ' green clay ' lying directly on the Chalk may possibly

be an outlier of the Reading Beds.

The Lower Tertiaries, thus outlined, possess no special interest, except that, beino-

impervious clays, they cut off impure surface waters, and are easier to bore through

than the loose sands, &c., overlying them.

The plane of the Chalk surface, whether under or beyond the Lower Tertiaries,

is sufficiently uniform to render calculation of its depth in any part of the district

an easy process. In the Bramfield boring, the latest of the series, the Chalk was

reached at 48 feet below the Ordnance Datum, calculation from the three nearest

       qziaJces in Europe. By Jos. P. O'Reilly, G.E., Professor of Mining

        and Mineralogy, Royal College of Science, Dublin.

       This memoir, based on the following memoirs published by the Royal Irish
 Academy-

      No. 1. ' Explanatory Notes and Discussion of the Nature of the Prismatic Forms

 of a Group of Basalts, Giant's Causeway.' ILI.Ac. Transactions XXII. Nov.

 has for object to compare the earthquakes which have occurred during the years
 1870-1878 with certain coast-line great circles of direction which traverse Europe,
 and which, originally traced by tlie author on a globe from the theoretical considera-

 tions contained in the memoir No. 2, have been transferred to the map of Europe.
 The memoir shows that certain relations of position do exist between the earth-
 quake localities and the great circles. Thus, that between two of these great
 circles, called by him S.E. Sofala Coast-line Direction, and E. Coast of England

 Direction, there is defined a band of Europe in which lie the earthquake coun-
 tries: Holland, district about Cologne, AVestphalia, Rhine provinces, Odenwald
 district. Upper Rhine district, Switzerland, Tyrol, Upper and Lower Italy (nearly
 entirely), and Sicily ; that is, the greater part of Europe markedly affected by
 earthquakes. That other great circles traverse them, forming bands equally re-
 markable as regards earthquake-movements, and, finally, that a very great number
 of earthquake localities are situated upon these great circle directions, or near their
intersections. That there is evidence of these localities tending to develop into
rectilineal directions, and, lastly, that outside Europe those great circles traverse
 districts markedly seismic in character, so that localities thus characterised, and

situated on the same great circle of direction, present a certain connection, and may

thus be brought into relation with it and with one another, as regards the earth-

quakes which may occur at them.
     The author further proposes to define extents of globe-surface affected bj^ earth-

quakes by considering them as being limited by such great circle directions
traceable a priori on the globe, as proposed by him in his Memoir No. 2.

        7. Oil the Island of Torghatten, By Professor W. J. Sollas,

                                           M.A., F.R.8.E., F.G.8.

     The author described the results of a visit which he made to this island in

July 1880.
     The platform from which the peak of the island rises is a narrow plain of marine

denudation, produced when the island was submerged 375 feet below its pi-esent
level. The timnel which traverses it is a sea-cave, excavated between two master-
joints. The floor of the cave is covered with angular blocks of gneiss, which have
fallen from the roof since the elevation of the cave-floor above the sea-level. The
blocks have fallen far more rapidly at the entrances of the cave than in the interior,
and, as a consequence, the roof rises from the middle towards each end of the tunnel,
and so does the angular debris, which thus forms at each entrance a vast sloping
mound. The vast quantity of fallen material is an interesting indication of what

has teen accomplished hy sunple meohanioal disintegration smce the island was
raised above the 375 feet level. The joints are the most important factors in
denudation ; excepting movtonnee faces, the author considers most of the bare rock
faces which constitute the surface of Northern Norway as merely exposed joint

planes. He has seen joints in the same rock, and having the same direction, ex-

tending from a few feet to over a thousand, and surface features in parallelism with

them, from a facet not a yard across to precipices over a thousand feet high.

                           8. On a Fragment of Mica Schist.
              By Professor W. J. SohLks, M.A., F.B.8.E., F.G.S.

     The author called attention to some appearances presented by a fragment of

mica schist pointed out to him by Prof. Wm. Ramsay, Ph.D., while walking

on the beach at Bodo, Norway. It is a tabular fragment, showing fine foliation
laminae, and traversed by an undidating vein of quartz. The undulations are very
high and narrow, eight complete ones occurring along a distance of 10 inches in a
straight line. The planes of foliation correspond to the bedding in the rocks of the
neighbourhood (amongst which the same phenomenon was afterwards noticed).
The folded quartz vein was originally straight, and cut across the laminae at right
angles ; the folding must have been accomplished by compression of the schist at
right angles to its folise ; and by measuring the length of the quartz vein between
two points, along its undulations (26 inches), and directty along its path (10
inches), one finds the amoimt of compression which has taken place (13: 5). The
argument is the same as that used by Dr. Sorby for the bed of quartzite folded

in the slate of Devonshire.

9. On the Geological Age and Itelations of the Siivalik and PiJcermi Ver-
   tebrate and Invertebrate Faunas. By W. T. Blanfokd, F.B.8., F.G.S.

     There is much similarity between the two collections of organic remains found
in the Siwalik beds of Northern India and the strata of Pikermi in Attica. Both
consist chiefly of mammalian remains, and amongst the forms represented there is
an immense preponderance of large animals, that is, of mammals ranging from the

size of a sheep to that of a large elephant, and a great deficiency of smaller species,
the micro-mammalia (small rodents, bats, and insectivores) being almost imrepre-
sented. In both, some bones of birds and reptiles and a few mollusca accompany
the mammals. Finally, both have been generally referred to the Miocene epoch.

     The Siwalik rocks are the upper strata of the Tertiaiy fringe, extending almost
throiighout the western and northern margins of the great Indo-Gangetic plain
from Sind to Assam. The mass of the typical Siwalik fossils were found in the
north-eastern Punjab, in the country between the Sutlej and Jumna, not far from
Simla. The Tertiary beds here consist of

                                                              Upper.

These two series roughly correspond to Upper and Lower Tertiary, the best-defined
horizon being that of Subathu, which is Nummiditic (middle or upper Eocene). The
Siwalik fossils are from the upper and middle Siwaliks. None of the beds, except

the Nummulities of Subathu, contain marine fossils.
     The rocks of Sind have recently been examined in detail, and the nimiber of

well-marked fossiliferous marine beds is much greater than in the sub-Himalayan
region. The tertiary beds are thus sub-divided :

There is little doubt that the upper Manchhars, 5000 feet thick, correspond to

upper and middle Siwalik.

    MyThe Gaj marine fauna is clearly Miocene, and rather upper than lower.

original view of the age, hased chiefly on the Echinodermata, has heen confirmed
Ahy Professor Martin Duncan's examination of the corals.
                                                          considerable number

of mammalia have been foimd in the lower Manchhar beds, which pass downwards

into the Gaj, and consequently cannot be older than upper Miocene.

    Turning now to the Siwalik mammalian fauna, it is, I believe, with the addition

of the species lately described by Riitimeyer and Bose, composed of 48 genera, com-

prising about 93 species, 23 genera being extinct, and 25 recent.
     Amongst the fossil genera, 12 are imknown elsewhere ; 4 Pseudalurus, Amphi~

cyan (the occurrence of tbis in true Siwalik beds is doubtful), Listriodon and Dor-

catherium are not known in beds later than Miocene in Europe, {Pseudalurus is

mfound Pliocene beds in America) ; 7 are Miocene and Pliocene of the recent genera

9 range back in Europe to upper Miocene ; 10 only to Pliocene ; and 6 are only

known elsewhere as li\'ing genera, or are found in Post -pliocene deposits. The very

large proportion of species belonging to recent genera, like Felts, Canis, Ursus,
Elephas {Euelephas and Lo.vodon), Equus, Cervus, Bos, Antilojte and Capi-a, gives a

singularly late aspect to the fauna.

Now, in the lower Manchhars of Sind no recent genera have been found except

Jihinoceros, Sus and Manis (the generic identification of the latter being excessively

doubtful), whilst Dinotherium, Antliracotlierium, Hyopotmnus, Hyotherimn, and'

two new genera allied to Merycopotmnus are found, none of which occur in the
Siwaliks proper, and the species common to the two, excluding Amphicyon, are

8 in number, consisting of forms of Mastodon, RJiinoceros, Acerotherium, Sus, Chali-
cotherium, and Dorcotherium. There are 10 extinct genera to two recent {Manis
beino- omitted as doubtful). There can be no question that the Manchhar fauna is
decidedly older than Siwalik. But Manchhar cannot be older than upper Miocene,

therefore Siwalik is Pliocene.

     This conclusion is supported by the facts that out of six forms of reptiles sufli-

ciently known to afford means of comparison, three are recent species ; that amongst

the four or five kinds of birds hitherto determined, one is probably identical with

the livins ostrich ; and that all the land and fresh-water shells found are forms

still existing. No such connexion with the recent fauna is known in any true

Miocene rocks. The geological evidence is also in favour of a newer age for the
fossiliferous Siwalik beds, as they form the upper members of the series ; whilst

the lower Manchhar rocks are at the base of formations whicli apparently represent

the Siwalik series.

     The sino-ularly Miocene aspect of a portion of the Siwalik mammalian fauna finds

a parallel in the case of Pikermi, in Attica ; although the age of the one does not

necessarily determine that of the other. The superb collection of remains made
and admirably described by Professor Gaudry has constantly been classed as Mocene
bv the describer. It comprises 30 genera, of which 19 are extinct. Of these 30
o-'enera, 1 3, besides HeUadofherium, which is very possibly identical with Sivatherium,
are found in the Siwaliks of India. The ruminants are in both very much more
numerous in proportion to the other artiodactyle ungulates than is usual in Miocene

strata · in the Siwalik, 33 against 10 ; in the Pikermi beds, 15 ruminants to 1 pig

and 1 ^Chalicotherium. Nevertheless, out of 42 species found at Pikermi, no less

than 15 are common to Miocene deposits in other parts of Europe. The connexion

between Pikermi beds and typical Miocene is thus very similar to that between

Siwalik and Manchhar beds.
     But the Pikermi beds at their base contain three characteristically Pliocene

marine shells. The question is, are the marine sheila or the mammalia to be

accepted as deciding the age of the beds ?

I agree so far with M. Gaudry, who at once accepts the evidence of the shells

and considers the beds Pliocene. But he thinks the mammalia were of Miocene

age, and that they died after  the close of the epoch                                                                                                       their bones being subsequently
                                                                                                                                                         ;

washed down into the Pliocene formations. In this view I cannot concur, because

bones decay when  exposed      to the  atmosphere                                                and                                                        I  can only conclude  that                                                                                  the

animals as well as the beds are of Pliocene age.

If these views be admitted, it will be seen that the evidence afforded by land

mammalia as to geological age cannot be accepted with the same confidence as that

of marine moUusca. It has long been found that the evidence of fossil plants is

very liable to mislead ; but in their case t)ie difficulty is greater, because the remains

do not always furnish equally clear proof of the relations of the fossils. There is

however, some reason to believe that the age of certain mesozoic beds in India, con-

taining land or fresh-water reptiles and fishes, is not the same as that of strata

characterised by the same animals in Europe ; and generally land and fresh-water

organisms do not seem so characteristic of age as marine fossils.

The explanation of the occurrence of so many Miocene forms in the Siwalik and

Pikermi beds is very possibly the migration southwards of the palfearctic Miocene

fauna. Some of the relations between the Siwalik animals and those of the penin-

sula of India at the present day, and the close connection between the fauna of
Pikermi and that now found in Africa may be

10. On the Sandstones and Grits of the Lower and Middle Series of the
           Bristol Coalfield. By Edward Wetheebd, F.G.S., F.G.S.

The Bristol coalfield is noted for its series of grits and sandstones, and these pro-

bably have their equivalents, in the South Wales and Forest of Dean coalfields as

well as in that of Somersetshire.      They serve as stratigraphical landmarks                                                                                                                                                                                          and it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

was the object of the .paper (1) to compare the grits of the above coalfield with
one another, with a view of ascertaining whether there were distinguishino- features
which might enable them to be respectively determined, and assist in coi-relation.

(2) To examine the chemical and physical conditions. (3) To note chano-es
which occur when rocks are in contact with carbonaceous matter. The first point
raised was the application of the term grit and sandstone. The author confirmed

the statement of Mr. Sorby, in his presidential address to the Geological Society

in 1880, to the efiect that the Carboniferous sandstones were composed of angular
grains. Of those examined by the author, the grains of the millstone grit were
the least angular. It was also pointed out, that as rocks show such variation of
coarseness_ in the same deposit, this could not be taken into consideration as a
test for grit. It was therefore suggested that the term grit should be confined to
those rocks which show angularity of grains, irrespective of coarseness ; and the
term sandstone to those which are composed of rounded grains (i.e. from which

the angularity has been removed). In any case, the term grit must be more gene-

rally applied to Carboniferous rocks than has been the case hitherto.

Reference was then made to ' duns,' which was defined as those Carboniferous

beds intermediate between grit or sandstone and clay. In mining operations

where the 'driving' of branches was by contract, questions arose between employer

and employed, in the case of ' hard duns,' as to whether it is ' stone ' or ' duns '

double price being paid for worldng in the former. It was also important for

geological pm-poses, in the construction of sections, that there shoidd be an easy

and ready test for this determination. The author suggested that the scratchiiio-

of glass would be a suitable one, which would represent a hardness of 7 for
" stone " (that which scratches glass).

GeoliHjy of India, chap, xxiv, 1879.

     The chief deposits of rock in the coalfield were then referred to- in ascending-
order, commencing -with the Millstone grit. Several samples of this, taken from
Brandon Hill, gave from 97'4 to 98-5 per cent, of silica. In places it is used for
Irick-making, being mixed -with the other material to increase the proportion of
silica. It -was pointed out that there -were other heds higher up in the coal-
measures -which -woidd do equally -well, and in some cases better, for this purpose.
The paper next referred to the ' Pennant grit.' There is considerable difficulty in
defining the limits of this deposit, but it was certainly not 2000 feet thick, as some
authors had stated. The paper places the thickness at about 970 feet ; but the
middle or Pennant series of coal measures, so called on account of the Pennant
being so extensively developed in this division, was about 2000 feet thick, and
this, probably, was the origin of the mistake regarding the thickness of the Pennant.

     The 970 feet of rock above referred to as tJie Pennant grit, was only entitled to
that name as a local distinction. It was nothing more than an extraordinary de-
velopment of a coal measure grit; the ' Doxall grit' of the lower series, for
instance, was quite as much a Pennant, if that term is to distinguish a certain class

of rock.

     After a careful examination of the rocks of the coalfield, the author had come
to the conclusion that, owing to the great similarity of Carboniferous arenaceous
rocks, occurring at diflerent horizons, it was at the risk of serious error to rely
upon them for correlation or stratigraphical landmarks. The proportion of silica
could be sometimes used as a guide in determining one from another, but little
reliance could be placed on it over a large area, as so many contained nearly about
the same amount.

      The author's analysis showed the first 50 feet of the Pennant to contain 90 per
cent, of silica ; but after this, for a considerable thickness, the proportion varied
from 84 to 89 per cent.

     The paper then referred to changes in the grits when in contact with carbo-
naceous matter. The author found that the proportion of alumina increased to
the whole, and this mostly as a silicate. By comparing the analysis of duns and
shale from the district -with that of these rocks, the same constituents were found to

be present, the great difference being in the greater proportion of alumina in duns

and shale. As a rule, the latter beds always overlie seams of coal ; but in cases

where rock followed, the author found that as it neared the coal it became more
 fissile and argillaceous.

      This change was ascribed to the action of carbonic acid gas, generated by de-
 composing vegetation on silicates. The analysis of the rocks given showed them
 to have been formed from the denudation of older silicate rocks, and the action of
 carbonic acid on such sediment would be to readily decompose all silicates with
 the exception of silicate of alumina, which would thus increase in proportion to
 the whole, and give rise to beds of the composition of duns and shale.* To this
 cause the author attributed the formation of the latter deposits, and contended
 that where they occur apart from carbonaceous matter is no proof that it was
 never there, and destroyed by decomposition.

                                                  M.A., F.B.S.

     The author called attention to this as a remarkably fine instance of a raised beach
having some pecidiar and unusual features. It extends the whole length of the
cliif in Rhos Sili Bay, facing the bay for a distance of li miles. The top of the
cliff consists of angidar rubble of Old Red Sandstone, sometimes showing traces of
rough stratification, and varying in thickness from 20 to 60 feet, overlying a beach
5 to 8 feet thick, consisting of well-rounded pebbles of various local, carboniferous
and other rocks, and containing in places many Turntella communis, with a few
Nassa incrassata, whereas in the more exposed raised beach at Mewslade before
described by the author, the shells were Patella vulgata, Littorina (2 spec.) and
Purpura lapillus. Under the beach, which is 8 to 12 feet above the present sea-
level, there is another rubble of Old Red Sandstone fragments, with in one place

blocks of a quartzose conglomerate, without stratification. Its thickness is not

known. The author considered the upper rubble to have been washed down from
the red sandstone hills which rise behind the beach by the water as the land rose

after submergence, as described in the next paper, while to the lower bed of rubble
he woidd ascribe a glacial origia.

2. On the Geological Evidence of the temporary Submergence of the South-
  west of Europe during the early Human Period. By Professor Peestwich,

   M.A., F.B.S.

    The author stated that, in the long course of investigation of the Quaternary Beds
in which he had been engaged, after referring the greater part of these beds to old
river, sea, or glacial action, there remained a residual set of phenomena which,
could not be accounted for by any of these agencies. In few cases were these re-
sidual drifts of any stratigraphical importance, and in character and structure
they differed greatly. They had been referred to various causes and to various
times, but he thought they were aU due to a common cause, that being the tem-
porary submergence of the land after the formation of the latest of the river gravels,
and after palaeolithic man had spread over Europe and the greater part of England.

     The submergence having been extremely slow and only temporary, while it is
supposed that the emergence took place with greater rapidity and by intermittent
movements, the effects of such changes lie as much in their denuding action on
loose materials as in the formation of any deposits. The latter, in fact, are com-

paratively insignificant. They include, besides the ' Warp ' of Trimmer, the ' Trail

of Fisher and the 'Head' of Godwin-Austen, and a series of loam and gravel
beds of greater dimensions. These various drifts all have certain featiu-es in
common. They are at their first origin always angular, they have their origin in
the adjacent vaUey or hUls, and are therefore entirely local, and they contain nothing
but the debris of a ten-estrial surface. The author showed that such deposits coidd
not be referred either to river or marine action, or to raia-wash, snow or ice, and
he gave reasons to show that they were in all probability the residt of this diluvial

action.

     The author relied greatly on the evidence of the angidar rubble {Head), over-
lying the raised beaches on both sides of the Chamiel, in which remains of the
mammoth, rhinoceros, and other quaternary animals were not unfrequently foimd,
and he further showed that in some instances paleeolithicjlint implements had been
foimd in the same beds. In river valleys the same diluvial beds overlaid valley

deposits with flmt implements.

    The author supposes that by this submergence 2ia^<solithic man was removed,
at aU events from all the lower lands, and the great extinct mammalia destroyed

and that the great superficial bed of gravel occupying the centre of our valleys,
and which is the result of the final ofi-flow of the waters, defines and limits the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

period of palaeolithic man, while, with the alluvial heds, neolithic man (whether or
not a descendant of palaeolithic tribes, who may have escaped to higher levels,

or whether introduced by migration) makes his appearance.
     The author gave some reasons to show that the effects of this submergence are

probably to be found over the greater part of Europe.

             3. Proofs of the Organic Nature of Eozoon Canadense.

                              By Charles Moore, F.G.8.

 . Referring to the earlier history of the Laureutian beds and to the Eozoon
Canadense, the author remarked on the pleasure he had experienced in having to
assist Sir William Logan, the Director of the Canadian Geological Survey, in un-

packing the large polished block of Laurentian limestone now in the Jermyn Street
Museum, at the Bath meeting of the British Association in 1864.

      After the paper then given by Sir William, the author ventured to express a
doubt as to Eozoon being organic, and that he rather believed the beds to represent
a mineralized or metamorphosed condition of rock-structure. That view he had
continued to entertain, reserving to himself a change of opinion when it could be
sho^vn that there was continuity of life and other organisms found in the enormous
thickness of 50,000 feet of rocks interposed between the Cambrian and the base of
the Laurentian series, where Eozoon was found. That desideratum had yet to be

attained.

     After noticing the views of authors on both sides of the controversy, which had
now extended to sixteen years, he remarked that his entering upon it was much
by accident and under considerable disadvantages. Whilst others had possessed
hundreds of cut and polished and other specimens for examination, he was possessed
of only two slices, and two small blocks weighing but twelve ounces, both in their
original conditions. From one of these he separated twenty grains, wliich on being
decalcified revealed to him the presence of clear siliceous-looking fibroid growth.
It was to be remembered that the material to be examined was scarcely more sub-
stantial than the motes or fibres seen floating in the sunbeam. Soon he obtained
others of various colours, black, green, and olive, but so like the fibre of to-day that
he suspected they must have got on the slide by some accident, and threw away
many such specimens. At last he was encouraged hj the presence of minute
curled specimens whose genuineness and organic origin could not be doubted, and
wliich coidd only be compared to the finest possible bits of polished golden -wire.
 Their shapes first led to the supposition that they were the shells of a Laurentian
 aimelid, but others followed of various forms, several of them tufted at their ends.

--One of the above is a very remarkable specimen. Seen under the microscope for
--they are all invisible to the naked eye it is formed of three round golden close-set

 coils. That this body is not a parasitic shell is evidenced by the fact that although
when dry it is rigid, when moist both curved and curled specimens are flexible

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 they ai"e substantial-looking objects as compared with others on the slide, and from

their form and colour stand out conspicuously. What ofiice they occupy if con-

nected with the ancient animal has yet to be determined. They are possibly a
 portion of its fibroid growth. They are not unlike the pedicle to wliich the capsule
 of some Rhizopoda are attached, but in such a case they must have been devoured
 by the Eozoon, which is not probable.

      In addition to the clear crystalline fibre previously mentioned, a close examina-
 tion occasionally revealed another form not thicker than a spider's web, like myce-
 lium growth of the present day.

      Mention was made of palmated or dendritic-like serpentinous casts, of probably
 the canal system. Not unlike these, but diflfering in structiu-e and much more
 delicate, were two fan-shaped bodies, with four long straight slender branches,
 equal in width throughout, of a brown colour, and springing from the same base
 they appear to have been longer originally.

      Although he might mention other points connected with Eozoon, he should
 conclude by remarking that amidst the material examined there occasionally
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  583

appeared bits of an amber-coloured or yellow semi-transparent film, and very rarely
a roimd yellow circular body surrounded by a broad band, wbicb be tbougbt migbt

possibly be Diatomaceae. At anotber time be recognised a group of eleven mucb
smaller forms, sbowng annular structure, wbicb, under the circumstances, were
most interesting and important ; but wbilst be was preparing to protect tbem by a
cell-covering tbey dried, sbrivelled up, and were lost. From what was said below

be believed the latter to be ova or gemmides, and the coloured film possibly even
an outer membrane, wbicb bitberto bad not been recognised in Foraminifera,

through wbicb the pseudopodial tubuli passed into the water.
     The evidence thus adduced that the Eozoon Canadense is organic was to himself

most convincing, and may be to the most sceptical ; but should it be replied, ' It is

true you have found traces of organic life in the Laurentian beds, but does it neces-
sarily follow that they belong to Eozoon, and that it is a member of the animal
kingdom ? ' to such objectors he had further confirmatory evidence of a most inte-
resting character to ofier. Amongst his duplicate fossils he had several specimens
of Nummtdites leevigatMS, to which Dr. Cai-penter and others consider Eozoon to be
allied, and some smaller forms, possibly the young of that shell, but of which he

was not quite certain. An examination of their structure showed the mycelium

growth, fine as the finest spider's web, as in Eozoon, which appeared to be attached
to the outer wall of the shell, and also, as in Eozoon, there appeared to be a membrane
of the thinnest kmd, through which the sarcode of the animal passed as pseudopodia.
Transparent crystalline alga-hke fibre was abundant, and in a partly decalcified
specimen he had this standing out freely. Then he had separated from the shell
closely-packed bands like a transparent network, or compressed together like a bit

of recent woollen fibre. Very minute in size may be seen yellow woim-like rami-
fying fibres, which at first he thought might be parasitic fungi, but he was at present
disposed to think they were too much mixed up with the animal sarcode to admit

of this supposition.

     There are, then, continual larger patches of yellowish branching ramified fibre,
passing into broader or thinner bands, -with network meshes, together with sarcode

or protoplasmic matter, so that it appears as if the whole or the greater portion of

the body of the Tertiary Nummulite was preserved. Scattered ^ath these materials
there are numerous amber-coloured granules, either single or in patches, which
were supposed to be the gemmules or ova of the animal. There were also present
pieces of the deep yellow, emerald green, and olive-coloured fibre, absolutely undis-

tingmshable from those obtained from Eozoon. And lastly, in a mineralised speci-
men there were casts in iron pyrites of the tubes, cells, and chambers of the interior
of the Nummulite, including many minute rounded spheres. These appear to

represent, and to be identical with, the infiltrated serpentinous casts which are

present under the same circumstances in Eozoon.
     Rather from curiosity than expecting to make any favourable comparisons he

had just examined the minute cells of Globigerina, brought up by the Challenger
from the bottom of the Atlantic, and in them he also found traces of fibre and

minute coloured fungi-like bodies, similar to those above referred to.

     From the evidence thus adduced it will be seen that there is an actual parallelism

between Eozoon and Foraminifera of more recent times, even to the minutest struc-
ture of the animals themselves. That the muscular fibre, the soft body, and

possibly even the ova of a creature, which as yet reveals to us the earliest trace of

animated existence, should have been preserved, is more than we could have antici-
pated. Although ages have passed away, and many miles of rock have intervened
between it and its living representatives, it tells us that the same natural law which

regulates all life has been continuous and permanent throughout.

     Eozoon is at present happily named, but there seems no reason why, if we could
discover beds still older than the Laurentians, we should not find earlier and still

earlier dawns of animal life. Nor did he think that Eozoon lived alone, but that

not only contemporary with it, but in the enormous thickness of beds intervening

between it and the Cambrian rocks, connecting links of organic life may stiU reward

the geological investigator.

4. 0?i some Pre-Camhrian Bocks in the Harlech Mountains, Merionethshire,

                            By Henkt Hicks, M.D., F.G.8.

During an excursion into the Harlech Mountains in the summer of last year, I

recognised, near the centre of the well-known anticlinal of Cambrian rocks, another

group of rocks which appeared to me to underlie the former, and to be part of a

pre-existing formation. On further examination, I noticed also that many of the

fragments in the conglomerates at the base of the Harlech grits seemed to be iden-

tical with the rocks below, and to have been derived from some such pre-existing

group. Subsequent microscopical examination of some of the fragments and of the

underlying rocks tended strongly to confirm this ^iew. In order, however, to satisfy

myself more fully on this poiut, I revisited the area this summer, accompanied by

my friends, Professor Hughes, Mr. Tawney, and Dr. R. D. Roberts, and the result

myhas been to entirely confirm  previous conclusions. This discovery is of consider-

able importance, as it enables us to compare the thickness of the Cambrian rocks

of North Wales more satisfactorily than has been hitherto possible with those of

South Wales, and to realise more clearly the early physical conditions of the areas.

Hitherto it seemed doubtful what the actual thickness of the Harlech group could
be, and very diiferent estimates have been given. It now becomes possible to give a

perfectly correct estimate, and it is satisfactory to find that it approximates far

more nearly with that made out in other Wekh areas than was previously sup-

posed. The points where these older rocks come to the surface mainly occur along

a line running nearly due N. and S. from Llyn-Cwmmynach to about two miles to

the S.W. of Trawsfynnydd. Along this line the anticlinal of Cambrian rocks is

considerably broken, and denudation has taken place to a very considerable extent.

It is mainly in consequence of this that the pre-Cambrian rocks are exposed. The

so-caUed intrusive felstones marked here on the survey maps are part of the pre-

Cambrian group, and are not intrusive in the Harlech rocks. They are highly

felsitic rocks, for the most part a metamorphic series of schists alternating with

harder felsitic bands, probably originally volcanic ashes. They alternate with

bands of purplish slates, which I once supposed might have been dropped amongst

them by faults, but which I now think also belong to the pre-Cambrian group, as

in the Pebidian rocks at St. Davids, and elsewhere. There are also some other

exposures of the pre-Cambrian rocks in the adjoining areas, and one very interesting
·section was carefully examined by Professor Hughes and myself to the east of the

Trawsfynnydd road between Caean Cochion and Penmaen, where the Cambrian

conglomerates could be seen resting unconformably upon the older series, and large

masses of the latter found plentifully in the conglomerates.

             5. On the Fault Systems of Central and West Cornwall.
                                 By J. H. Collins, F.O.S.

     The author remarked that the faults and fault-systems of the district in question
"were very numerous, but that they were much more important, on account of their

mineral contents, than for their mechanical effect in displacing the strata. After

-- --referring to the eight systems of faults all being mineral veins which were defined

by Mr. Jos. Came in 1818, the author brought forward evidence to prove that no
fewer than fifteen distinct fault-systems of as many different ages could still be

traced, all having been produced in post-carboniferous times. The fifteen systems
were detailed as follows :

     1. Granite junction faults, the fiUing generally schorlaceous, and often stan-

           niferous.

     2. The older Elvan faults (the Little Elvan at Polgooth, &c.), more or less

           granitic in their filling.

     3. The oldest tin lodes (Polgooth, &c.), heaved by the Great Elvan.
     4. Newer Elvan faults (Polgooth, Great Elvan, &c.).
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  585

       5. Newer tin lodes (Trevaimance, &c.), underlying northwards mostlj%
      6. Newest tin lodes (Trevaiinance, Wheal Owles, &c.) mostly underlying

                southwards.
       7. Older east and west copper lodes producing tin in depth (Dolcoath, &c.)

        8. Older caunter copper lodes.

        9. Older cross-courses.

     10. Newer east and west copper lodes (Wheal Peevor).
     11. Newer caunter copper lodes.
     12. Newest copper lodes (Wheal Peevor).
     13. Newer cross-courses and flucans.

     14. Newest flucans and slides,

      15. Alluvial faults.

     The author showed that the older fissures were occupied either with quartz,
together with tourmaline or stanniferous deposits (1, 3, 5), or else with granite and
felsitic matter (2, 4) ; that the fissures of intermediate age were occupied chiefly by
oxidised and sulphuretted copper ores near the surface, and hy tin ores in depth
(6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12), or else by quartz, with small quantities of ores of nickel, cobalt,
ui-aniiun, &c. (9) ; while the newer fissures contained only quartz, oxide of iron,
galena, and blende (13, 14) ; while the newest of all contained little besides
clay (15). In all (except 2 and 4) there are evidences of the partial mechanical

infil ling of open fissures.

    In many cases the absolute amount of vertical displacement is small, in others
it cannot be exactly ascertained, the most marked eflfects in this respect being pro-
duced by the cross-courses and cross-flucans (9, 13, 14). These cross-courses, &c.,

occur in great numbers between Hayle and Padstow, and owing to the fact that
the downthrows are nearly always on the east sides of the respective faults, the
total vertical displacement between these points cannot be less than 2000 feet, and

is probably much more. In this way, older and stiU older rocks appear at the

present surface as one proceeds westward.
     The author concluded by briefly calling attention to the physical efiects of these

fault systems as developed in coast-lines and valleys.

                     6. On the Geology of the Balearic Islands.
                             By Dr. Phen^, F.S.A., F.G.8.

     In the two preceding years I have had the honour of drawing the attention of the
Section to the magnificent effects of lime deposits in the Grottos of Antiparos, and

to the almost mountainous dimension of the external deposits, called Pambuk

Kalesi, at Hierapolis, in Anatolia.

     There are some remarkable features in the geology of Minorca, in which
that science has a beneficially sanitary effect, though it is probable that experience
rather than scientific research produced in the first instance the effect, and then

influenced popular opinion.

     The island is geologically divided into two complete sections, which face each
other in a continuous and very slightly de-viating line from north-west to south-
east. The southern portion is an almost uniform rock of Miocene formation, wkich
occupies an area of more than half the island ; the more northern begins on the
east with a sea-coast of Devonian rocks running continuously to the north coast,
with a mean breadth of three miles, succeeded by Lower Triassic beds, which crop
up again further west, between which two portions is a broad Jurassic belt, curi-
ously meandered by Upper Trias, and succeeded again by a broad field of Devonian
formation. The large area of these various formations is -found to be unhealthy for
abode, though this may be entirely the result of latitude; but here at least they
seem to contract the moist vapours which often hover over all the islands, while
the rocky surface of the Miocene is much drier. All the large towns are erected
on the latter, as Mahon, Cuidadella, Alayor, St. Cristobal ; and Ferrerias is on the

border.

     In Majorca, to the north-west side of the island, the Jurassic formation rises
586 REPOET-- 1880.

into a lofty cordillera, tlie highest peak of which attains an elevation of nearly

4400 feet above the sea. In this series of elevations are many eruptive rocks. The
centre of the island is occupied by a fertile plain of rich soil on a base of Miocene
{moyen) in the area of which are lacustrine beds. There are cretaceous beds, some
abimdant fossiliferous deposits, and some magnificent conglomerates of rich gold,
red, and black coloiu's. Some of the limestones exhibit the richest colours of

marble.
      This slight general sketch is sufficient probably to interest the practical investi-

gator, and the Grotto de I'Homme Mort, with its abundant fossils, would alone well

repay an examination.
     There are some fine caves in Minorca, but the beautiful effects of the Cueva de

la Hermita in the larger island tend speedily to make them forgotten.
     The entrance to this cave is at a considerable elevation on the coast, which

Deing attained the descent is easy. The dimensions are imusual, and the inspection
occupies some hours. At intervals Bengal lights are burned, when a view opens
which puts even the elegant tracery of Gothic and Moorish architecture aside.
Long lines of light, straight, and uniform columns seem to multiply the effects of
AVestminster Abbey, while there is hardly a form, from magnificent organs, to
pxilpits, side chapels, and even mural monuments, that the eye does not figure to
itself as realities. The progress of the stalactitic formation has evidently been
arrested for centuries here, though still going on slightly in the caves in INllnorca.
With the exception of one or two small but good springs, there is no water on
either island. Rain is collected in the winter in tanks and drawn up from wells.
In some places, however, water is to be obtained by boring.

     The author then gave some analyses of lignite, and referred to the metalliferous
mines in Iviza and elsewhere.

               7. On a Striated Stone from the Trias of Portishead.

           By Professor W. J. Sollas, M.A., F.B.S.E., F.O.S.

    This was a description of a striated fragment of carboniferous limestone from
the Triassic breccia of Portishead. The striation was, however, not due to glacial
action, but it is of the nature of ' slickenside.' The fragment was derived from the
neighbourhood of the great fault which traverses the carboniferous rocks of the
vicinity. It is interesting, since it shows that slickensided fragments, when occur-
liiig in a breccia, can be at once distinguished from true glaciated fragments, and
could never deceive any experienced geologist. At the same time it might serve as

a caution in receiving statements with regard to the finding of striated fragments
which had not been submitted to competent authorities.

                     8. On the Action of a Lichen on Limestone.
             By Professor W. J. Sollas, M.A., F.B.S.E., F.G.S.

     The author referred to the presence of minute hemispherical pits sprinkled over
the surface of many exposed limestone faces. These he showed were produced by the
apothecia of a lichen, Verrucaria rupest7-is, as noticed by Sowerby. They are inte-
restmg as showing that the action of lichens is not purely conservative, but to some
extent denuding, and also as proving that very similar cavities to those made by
Cliona, which have been attributed to mechanical action, may be made by a vege-
table which has no hard parts, and is almost as motionless as the stone on which
i 1 grows. Here all other agencies being eliminated, we have a case of excavation
by purely chemical action,

     9. On Sponge-spicules from the ChalJc of Trimm,ingham,, Norfolk.
            By Professor W. J. Sollas, M.A., F.B.S.E., F.O.S.

     This was an account of some sponge-spicules from the chalk of Trimmingham,
Norfolk. They occur in association with flint nodules which have been incompletely

Bysilicified.  treating the flints with dilute acid, a siliceous sediment remains,

consisting of silicified tests of foraminifera, valves of entomostraea and erinoidal

network, siliceous and glaucouitic casts of foraminifera, and sponge-spicules.

Amongst the siliceous casts of foraminifera is a dumbbell-shaped form, derived

from two chambers of a Nodosaria, and mistaken by Zittel for a sponge-spicule.

The sponge-spicules are snow-white and opaque by reflected light, but when

moimted in Canada balsam so transparent as to be nearly invisible. They have

become crypto-crystalline, give colours with polarised light, and have correspond-

ingly acquired a higher refractive index than they possessed in the fresh state

(Sollas, ' Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.' 1877, vol. xix. p. iiO). They are eroded super-

ficially, and sometimes covered with little hemispherical pits ; occasionally dendrites
of iron pyrites are seen shooting through their substance, the flrst stage of a replace-

ment which is found completed in spicules from other deposits.

The spicules belong cliiefly to Hexactinellid and Tetractinellid sponges. Of the

latter forms Lithistids are frequent ; they resemble the recent forms Corallistes mi'

crotuberculatus, Lyidium torquilla, Discodermia polydiscus, Rhacodiscula astei'oides,

and Kaliapsis cidaris ; and are allied to the cretaceous genera described by Zittel
iinder the names Pachinion scriptmn, Scytalia turbinata, Dorydermia dichotoma,

Callopegma acaule, and Ragadinia rirnosa. The forms resembling Kaliapsis may

be termed Coinpsapsis cretacea. The depth at which the living Lithistids most

nearly related to the fossil ones have been found, varies from 74 to 375 fathoms.

Of other Tetractinellids there are stellate globides referable to Tethya, and

scarcely distinguishable from those of Tethya lyncurium ; these may be knowTi as
Tethylites cretaceus, a genus not in any way related to Zittel's Tethyopsis, as that

is placed by him with Tetilla cranium. Calthrop-like spicules referable to Carter's

Dercitites Haldonensis are common, also others probably related to Zittel's Pachas-

trella pnmcva. Tuberculated globules, similar to the characteristic globules of

Pachnstrella geodoides, Carter, occur. This li-ving species was brought up from a

depth of 292 fathoms, near St. Vincent's.

Ordinary geodid globules of various sizes are exceedingly common in various

stages of decay, similar to those which the author has produced artificially in

recent sponge-spicules by the action of caustic potash. "With the globules were

associated the usual geodid anchors, grapnels, and acerate spicules. Many are of

the same forms as Carter's Geodites Haldonetms, and find tlieir nearest ally in the

existing Geodia McAndretm, which has been dredged from 100 to 270 fathoms.

   A club-shaped spicule, i.e. generally conical, rounded at the ends, and tubercu-

lated all over, ^'^^-inch long, and j~ broad where largest, is not unfrequent ; it is quite

unlike any existing spicule, and may be provisionally termed Phopaloconus cretaceus.

    Many other forms not mentioned here occur plentifidly, and the nimiber of
difierent species found in the same flint is remarkable, but in this connection it may

be remembered that Carter has described no less than seven entirely difierent

species of sponge growing together on a thin fragment of Lophohelia prolifera, not

quite two square inches in extent.

    British Columbia includes a certain portion of the length of the Cordillera region

of the west coast of America, which may be described as consisting here of four

parallel mountain ranges running in a north-west and south-east bearing. Of these
the south-western is represented by Vancouver and the Queen Charlotte Islands,

and maybe referred to as the Vancouver Range ; while the next, to the north-east,

is the Coast or Cascade Range, a belt of mountainous country about 100 miles in
width. This is succeeded by the interior plateau of British Columbia, relatively

a depressed area, but with a height of 3000 to 3500 feet. To the north-east of
this is the Gold Range, and beyond this the Rocky Mountains proper, forming

the western margin of the great plains of the interior of the continent.
     Tertiary rocks, which are probably of Miocene age, are found both on the coast

and on the interior plateau. They consist on the coast of marine beds, generally
littoral in character, which are capped, in the Queen Charlotte Islands, by volcanic
rocks. The interior plateau has been a fresh-water lake, in or on the margin of
which, clays and sandstones, with occasional lignites, have been laid down. These
are covered by very extensive volcanic accumulations, basaltic or tufaceous.

     Cretaceous rocks from the age of the Upper and Lower Chalk to the Upper
Neocomian, and representing the Chico and Shasta groups of California, occur on
Vancouver aud the Queen Charlotte Islands. Beds equivalent to the Chico group
yield the bituminous coals of Nanaimo, while anthracite occm's in the somewhat
older beds of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Within the Coast Range the Cretaceous
rocks are probably for the most part equivalent in age to the Upper Neocomian.
The Cretaceous rocks are of great thickness, both on the coast and inland, and

include extensive contemporaneous volcanic beds.

    The pre-Cretaceous beds have been much disturbed and altered before the
deposition of the Cretaceous, and their investigation is difficult. On Vancouver

Island, beds probably Carboniferous in age include jn'eat masses of contemporaneous
volcanic material, with limestones, and became altered to highly crystalline rocks
resembling those of parts of the Huronian of Eastern Canada. In the Queen
Charlotte Islands also these beds probably occur ; but an extensive calcareous
argillite formation is there found, which is characterised by its fossils as triassic.

     The Coast Range is supposed to be built up chiefly of rocks like those of Van-
couver Island, but still more highly altered, and appearing as gneisses, mica-schists,
&c., while a persistent argillaceous and slaty zone is supposed to represent the
triassic argillites of the Queen Charlotte Islands.

     The older rocks of the interior plateau are largely composed of quartzites and
limestones ; but still hold much contemporaneous volcanic matter, together with
serpentine. Carboniferous fossils have been found in the limestones in a number
of places. The triassic is also represented in some places by great contemporaneous
volcanic deposits with limestones.

     In the Gold Range, the conditions found in the Coast Range are supposed to be

repeated ; but it is probable, that there are here also extensive areas of archaean

rocks. Some small areas of ancient crystalline rocks supposed to be of this age

have already been discovered.
     The Rocky Mountain Range consists of limestones with quartzites and shaly

beds, dolamites and red sandstones. The latter have been observed near the 49th
parallel, and are supposed to be triassic in age. The limestones are, for the most
part. Carboniferous and Devonian, and no fossils have yet been discovered indica-
ting a greater age than that of the last-named period. On the 49th parallel, how-
ever, the series is supposed to extend down to the Cambrian, and compares closely
·with the sections of the region, east of the Wahsatch, on the 40th parallel, given by
                                                                                      ;

Clarence King. Volcanic material is still present in tlie Carboniferous rocks on the

49th parallel.
     The oldest land has been that of the Gold Range, and the Carboniferous deposits

laid down east and west of this barrier difler widely in character. The Carboni-

ferous closed with a disturbance which shut the sea out from a great area east of
the Gold Range, in which the red gypsiferous and saline beds of the Jura-trias were
formed. In the Peace River region, however, marine triassic beds are found on both

sides of the Rocky Mountains.

   A great disturbance, producing the Sierra Nevada and Vancouver ranges, closed

the Triassic and Jurassic period. The shore line of the Pacific of the Cretaceous in
British Columbia lay east of the Coast Range, and the sea communicated by the
Peace River region "with the Cretaceous Mediterranean of the great plains. The
Coast Range and the Rocky Mountains are probably in great part due to a post-Cre-
taceous disturbance, though the last-named range existed before the Cretaceous

period in the Peace River region.

     No Eocene deposits have been found in the province. The Miocene of the

interior plateau is probably homologous with that of King's Pah-Ute lake of the
40th parallel. In the Pliocene epoch the country appears to have stood higher above
the sea-level than at present, and during this time the fiords of the coast were

probably worn out.

5. On the Post-Tertiary and more recent deposits of Kashmir and the Upper
   Indus Vallexj. By Lt.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen, F.E.8., F.G.S., ^c.

   .

     1. Tertiary and Karcwa Deposits of Kashmir. Describes the Tertiary (Pleis-
tocene) Hirpur Series on northern flank of the Pir Panjal, and gives measured
section showing the changes of conditions that were going on during their deposi-
tion. Div-ides the post-tertiary Karewa deposits into an older series (Islamabad),
and a newer in the low-level terraces toward Baramula. The successive lacustrine
deposits of Kashmir owe their origin apparently to the gradual elevation of the
gneissic axis of the Pir Panjal and Kajnag ranges to the south and south-west, which
axis crosses the main drainage line of the Jhelum below Baramula.

      2. Alluvial deposits of Skardo. Gives measured section of a portion of the above
deposits near Kepchuu, and shows the existence of two periods of glacial conditions

in the Himalayas.
      3. Laeustmie deposits of the Indus Valley. That from time to time the valley

of the Indus has presented at different portions of its course a precisely similar

appearance as we see now in the Pang-Kong Lake. That the coarse u-regularly

stratified gravels of Mulbi, Kiurbo, &e., are older than the fine stratified silt
of the Indus, near Lamayiu-u, and that they bear the same relation to them as
those of the Ohang-chingmo do to the Pang-Kong valley lacustrine beds.

     4. Glacial action. On the very probable extension of glaciers from the Kajnag
Range as far down as the Jhelum valley.

     The absence of striae marks on rocks in parts of the Himalayas that were once

 subjected to ice action, is no proof that such glacial conditions never existed
 greater denudation than in Europe, and the greater distance in time, having oblite-

 rated such record and altered the valley sections.

6. Notes on the occurrence of Stone Implements in the Goast Laterite, south
   of Madras, and in high-level gravels and other .formations in the South

   Mahratta Country. By R. Bruce Foote, F.G.S., of the Geological

    Survey of India.

    The author, after alluding to the area over which these chipped implements were
knowTi to occur in the Coast Laterite, when he read a paper to the Geological
Society of London, in June 1868 (which area extended from the Palar river near
Madras, nearly to the Kistna river), and pointing out that no such implement had

then been found south of the former river, proceeds to enumerate various localities
within the Coast Laterite areas south of the Palar, in which he had been success-

ful in discovering implements. He shows that as the material, quartzite, used in

the more northerly parts is not found south of the Palar river, the southern
makers had recourse to various other materials, generally chert, sometimes
granular quartz rock of gneissic age. The presence of implements artificially made
remains as then the sole positive proof of the existence of man. The new localities
yielding implements are : 1. Ninniyur, 40 miles N.E. of Trichinopoly, in talus-
debris of the WodiarpaUiam Laterite plateau. 2. Vallam, 7 miles south-west of
Tanjore, several large flakes in situ in lateritic conglomerate. 3. Shuragudi, 16
miles south of Pudu-kotai, a large rude hatchet in lateritic debris close to the
boimdary of the great Shah-kotai laterite plateau. 4. Madura, in a coarse lateritic
shingle-bed, apparently an outlier of the Sivaganga laterite area, several rude oval
implements. Besides the above the author obtained a chert flake knife with one
edge serrated, from a river gravel newer than the laterite at Tripatur in Madura
district ; also from the surface, associated with scattered lateritic debris, a chert-
flake of arrowhead shape, and a well-shaped core of chert, believed to be the first
of its kind found in South India.

     The author then describes certain high-level, partly lateritic, gravels of flu\-ia-
tile and lacustrine origin in the basins of the CTatprabha and Malprabha tributaries
of the Kistna in the South Mahratta coimtry, which yielded large numbers of fine
quartzite implements of several types :

     Lastly, the occurrence is mentioned of weU-shaped implements, chiefly of the
pointed oval type, and made of hard siliceous limestone, in a great talus of lime-
stone and Deccan trap blocks, cemented by calcareous tufa into a great breccia
conglomerate. This occurs along the foot of the hills north of the Kistna, and
west of Soorapoor, in the Nizam's territory. These implements were found washed

out in gullies.

7. On the Fre-Glacial Contours and Post-GIacial Denudation of the North'
                West of England. By C. E. De Range, F.G.S.

The coimtry described is that lying between the Silurian mountains of North

Wales and the Lake District, and bounded east by the Carboniferous hills of the

Pennine chain. The plains of Lancashire and Cheshire lying at their feet are

deeply covered with Glacial drift, reaching in one instance, near Ormskirk, a thick-

ness of no less than 230 feet. The deep valleys of the Lake District had attained

theu- present proportions before the Glacial epoch, during which the lake-baains

--were excavated in the case of Windermere to a depth of 2.30 feet, or deeper than

the English Cliamiel between Boulogne and Folkestone, the bottom of the lake

being 100 feet beneath the sea-level. In the valleys of the mountain country the

mariae Glacial deposits are not present, having been re-excavated out by later

glaciatiou, where originally present. In Lancashire, Cheshire, and Flintshire the

marine drift occupies an extensive area, and valleys like those of the Ribble and

the Irwell,,nearly 200 feet in depth, have been excavated in and through them.

Occasionally the bottom of the valley is beneath the sea-level, pointing to the land

Abeing higher in pre-glacial times.  terrace of post-glacial deposits fringes the

glacial area at, and often below, the sea-level, consistmg of peat, with a forest at

the base, resting on a marine post-glacial deposit. The peat bands are found beneath

the sea-level to an extent, in one case, of about 70 feet, and it was pointed out that

an elevation of this amount would connect Lancashii-e, Cheshire, and much of North

Wales with the Isle of Man.

President of the Section--A. 0. L. Gunihee, M.A., M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S.,

                                                              r.L.s.

DEPARTMENT OP ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.

                   THUBSDAY, AUGUST 26.

The President delivered the following Address :

Sixteen years ago, at the meeting of the British Association in Bath, the duty

·which I am endeavom-iug to discharge to-day was entrusted to my predecessor and

old friend, the late Dr. John Edward Gray, In the address which he then de-

livered before this Section, he spoke on ' Museums, their Use and Improvement,

and he who had devoted a whole lifetime to the formation and management of one

of the greatest zoological collections in the world, was well qualified to give an

opinion and advice on this subject. Indeed, when I read now what he then insisted

on as a necessary change in the system of Museums, I feel compelled to pay a

passing tribute to his memory.

Zoology, geology, botany were to him not distinct and independent studies ; the

views advanced by a Lamarck, by a Trevii'anus, -viz., that our knowledge of these

sciences would remain fragmentary and one-sided as long as they were not studied in

their mutual relations, found in him one of the earliest advocates in this country.

Against all opposition he tried to unite the Zoological and Palaeontological col-

lections in the British Museum, giving up this attempt only after having convinced

himself of the impracticability of  the scheme                                               and  he  readily joined the  band  of
                                                                                          ;

men who demanded that a Museum should be not merely a repository for the

benefit of the professed student and specialist, but serve in an equal measure for

the recreation of the whole mass of the people and for their instruction in the i

principles of Biology. This was the spirit in which he worked, and in the last

years of his life he had the satisfaction of being able to say that thei-e was no other

collection in existence more accessible and more extensively used than the one

under his charge.

I am encouraged to return to-day to the same subject, because I have daily

the opportunity of observing that the public more and more comprehend the use of

Museums, and that thej' appreciate any real improvements, however slight. Para-

graphs, leaders, articles published in the public journals and periodicals, references

--made in speeches or addresses, questions put in the Houses of Parliament whenever

an opportunity offers all testify that the progress of Museums is watched with

interest. Not long ago a Royal Commission entered deeply and minutely into the

subject, and elicited a mass of evidence and information invaluable in itself, though

you may differ from some of the conclusions and views expressed in their final

report. Biological Science has made rapid strides: not only do we begin to under-

stand better the relations of the varieties of living forms to each other, but the

number of varieties themselves that have been made known has also been increased

beyond all expectation, and the old repositories have everywhere been found too

narrow to house the discoveries of the last forty years. Therefore you find that

the United States, Austria, Prussia and Saxony, Denmark and Holland, France
                       ;

 and Great Britain have erected, or are building anew, their National Museums, not
to mention the numerous smaller museums which are more or less exclusively
 devoted to some branch of Biological Science.

      The purposes for which Museums are formed are threefold : 1. To diffuse
instruction among, and offer rational amusement to the mass of the people ; 2. To
aid in the elementary study of Biology, and 3. To supply the professed student of

 Biology or the specialist with as complete materials for his scientific researches as

can be obtained, and to preserve for future generations the materials on which

those researches have been based.

     Although every museum has, as it were, a physiognomy of its own, differing
from the others in the degree in which it fulfils one or two or all three of those
objects, we may divide museums into three classes, viz. : (1) National; (2) Pro-
vincial ; and (3) Strictly educational museums : a mode of division which may
give to those of this assembly who are not biologists an idea of what we mean by
the term ' species.' The three kinds pass into each other, and there may be hybrids

between them.

     The museum of the third class, the Strictly Educational institutions, we find

established chiefly in connection with universities, colleges, medical and science

schools. Its principal object is to supply the materials for teaching and studying

the elements and general outlines of Biology ; it supplements, and is the most
necessary help for, oral and practical instruction, which always ought to be com-
bined with this kind of museum. The conservation of objects is subservient to
their immediate utility and unrestricted accessibility to the student. The collec-

tion is best limited to a selection of representatives of the various groups or ' types,'

arranged in strictly systematic order, and associated with preparations of such

parts of their organisation as are most characteristic of the group. Collections of

this kind I have seen arranged with the greatest ingenuity, furnishing the student
with a series of demonstrations which correspond to the plan followed in some

elementary textbook. This, however, is not sufficient for practical instruction

besides the exhibited permanent series, a stock of well-preserved specimens should

be kept, for the express purpose of allowing the student to practise dissection and

the method of independent examination ; and in this latter I am inclined to include

the method of determining to what order, family, genus, or species any given

object should be referred. By such practice alone can the student learn to under-

stand the relative value of taxonomic characters and acquire the elementary know-
ledge indispensable for him in the future. Finally, in the educational museum
should be formed a series of all the animals and plants which are of economic
value or otherwise of importance to man. The proposal to unite living and extinct
forms in one series, which has been urged by eminent men with such excellent
reasons, might be tried in the educational museum with great advantage to the
student, as the principal objections that are brought forward against this plan being

carried out in larger collections, do not apply here.

   A museum which offers to the teacher and student the materials mentioned

fulfils its object ; its formation does not require either a long time or heavy ex-
pense ; but the majority of these institutions outgrow in time their original limits
in one or the other direction ; and if such additions do not interfere with the
general arrangement of the museum, they neither destroy its character nor do they

add to its value as a strictly educational institution.

    The principal aim of a Provincial Museum ought, in my opinion, to be popular

instruction. I do not mean that it should be merely a place for mild amuse-
ment and recreation ; but that it should rank equal with all similar institutions
destined to spread knowledge and cultivate taste among the people. To attain this

aim, it should contain an arranged series of well-preserved specimens, representing

as many of the remarkable types of living forms as are obtainable ; a series of useful,

as well as noxious, plants and animals ; of economic products obtained from the ani-
mal and vegetable kingdoms ; and last, but not least, a complete and accurately
named series of the flora and fauna of the neighbourhood. The majority of Pro-

vincial Museums with which I am acquainted are far from coming up to this ideal.
One of the first principles by which the curator of such a museum should be guided
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      --

is to admit into his collection no specimen, unless it be well mounted, and a fair

Herepresentative of its species.                                                                                                                         has not the excuse of his colleague in charge of a

large museum, who has to retain those monsters which are literally his betes-noires,

viz., specimens to which a history is attached, iind the removal of which would

sooner or later be resented by some of his fellow- labourers. The only too frequent

presence of such badly mounted specimens in Provincial Museums is not always

the fault of the curator. The slender means with which he is provided are generally

insufficient to encourage taxidermists to bestow the necessary amount of skill and

time on their work. Besides, taxidermy is an art which depends as much on

natural gift as drawing or modelling ; and as long as we are obliged to be satisfied

with receiving into our collections mediocre specimens, mediocre staffers wiU take

       up taxidermy as a trade without there being one among them who is naturally

I qualified for it.
     The direct benefit of a complete collection of the flora and fauna of the district
in which the Provincial Museum is situated, is obvious, and cannot be exaggerated.

The pui'suit of collecting and studying natural history objects gives to the persons
who are inclined to devote their leisure hours to it a beneficial training for whatever

their real calling in  life  may  be :                                                                                                                   they acquire  a  sense of  order and method                                                                                                                                                  they

graphs of the British Fauna and                                                                                                                          Flora in which this country excels                                                                                                                                                           and I consider

its formation in every Provincial Museum to be of higher importance than a collec-

tion of foreign objects.

The majority of Provincial Museums contain not only biological collections, but

myvery properly, also, collections of art and literature. It is no part of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            task to

speak of the latter ; but before I proceed to the next part of my address, I must

say that nothing could more strikingly prove the growing desire of the people for

instruction than the erection of the numerous Free Libraries and Museums now

spread over the country. The more, the healthier their rivahy, the safer their

growth will be, especially if they avoid depending on aid from the State, or placing

themselves in the hands of a responsible minister ; if they remain what they are

municipal institutions, the children and pride of their own province.

    However great, however large a coiintry or a nation may be, it can have, in
reality, only one National Museum truly de3er\'ing of the name. Yours is the
British Museum ; those of Scotland and Ireland can never reach the same degree of
completeness, though there is no one who wishes more heartily than I do that they

mav' approach it as closely as conditions permit. The most prominent events in the

recent history of the British Museum (to which I must confine the remainder of my

--remarks) are well known to the majority of those present : that the question either

of enlarging the present building at Bloomsbury, or of erecting another at South

Kensington for the collections of Natural History, was fully discussed for years in

its various aspects; that, finally a Select Committee of the House of Commons

reported in favour of the expediency of the former plan ; that the Standing Com-

mittee of the Trustees, than whom there is no one better qualified to give an opinion,

took the same view; and that, nevertheless, the Government of the time decided

upon severing the collections, and locating the Natural History in a separate build-

ing, as the more economical plan.

The building was finished this year at a cost of 400,000/. exclusive of the

amount paid for the ground on which it is erected. It is built in the Romanesque

or round-arched gothic style, terra-cotta being almost exclusively employed in its

construction. It consists of a basement, ground floor, and two storeys, and is

divided into a central portion, and a right and left wing. Its principal (southern)

facade is G75 feet long. As you enter the portal you come into a cathedral-like

hall, called the 'Index Museum,' 120 feet long, 97 feet wide, and 68 feet high;

behind this there is a large side-lighted room for the British Fauna. On each side

of the hall there is a side-lighted gallery, each 278 feet long, by 50 feet in width
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

seven other galleries of various widtbs, and, therefore adapted for various exhibi-

.tions, join at right angles the long gallery of the ground floor. The first and
second storeys are occupied by galleries similar to the main gallerj- of the ground

floor.

  --The collections are distributed in this building thus : The v?estern vring is

occupied by Zoology, the eastern by the three other departments, viz. the gromid-
floor by Geology, the first-floor gallery by Mineralogy, and the second-floor gallery
by Botany. The central portion is, as mentioned above, divided into the room for
British Zoology and into the * Index Museiun,' that is, ' an apartment devoted to
specimens selected to show the type-characters of the principal groups of organized
beings.' The basement consists of a number of spacious, well-lit rooms, well
adapted for carrying on the different kinds of work in connection with such large

collections.

There is no doubt that the building fulfils the principal condition for which it

was erected, viz., space for the collections. The Zoological collections gain more

thau twice as much space as they had in the old building, the Geological and

Mineralogical about thrice, and the Botanical more than four times. This increase

of space w^ill enable the keeper of the last-named department to bring the collec-

tions correlated with each other into close proximity, and to prepare a much greater

iiumber of objects for exhibition than was possible hitherto. The Mineralogical

Department, already so admirably arranged in the old building, has now been sup-

plied with the space requisite for a collection of rocks, with a laboratory and gonio-

metrical room. Geologj^ is now in a position to exhibit a great part of the

Invertebrata, which hitherto had to be deposited in private studies, besides devoting

one or two of the new galleries to a stratigraphical series. On the Zoological side

we have been great gainers (not with regard to the proportion of space), but inas-

much as we were more impeded by the crowded state of our collections, than any
of the other departments : we are enabled to avoid the exhibition of heterogeneous
objects in the same room or gallery ; mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, mollusks,

insects, echinoderms, corals, and sponges have each a smaller or larger gallery to

themselves. With the exception of the specimens preserved in spirits, the studj'-

series can be located in contiguity with, or at least, close vicinity to, the exhibition-

series. There is ample and convenient accommodation for students; besides a

spacious room, centrally situated, and arranged for the exclusive use of students,

this class of visitors can be accommodated at four other diflerent localities imme-

diately adjoining the several branches of the collection.

I believe that some of the members of the British Association will feel some-

what disappointed that the Zoological and Botanical collections on the one hand, and

Whothe Palseontological on the other, continue to be kept distinct.  wall, who

can, doubt that the two branches of Biological science would be immensely

benefited by being studied in their natural mutual relations ? and that Palseon-

tolog}'- more especially would have made surer progress if its stud}^ had been con-

ducted with more dii'ect application to the series of living forms ? But to study

the series of extinct and living forms in their natural connection is one thing, and

to incorporate in a museum the collection of fossil with that of recent forms,

is another. The latter proposal, so excellent in theory, would ofler in its prac-
tical execution so many and insuperable difficulties that we may well hesitate

before we recommend the experiment to he tried in so large a collection as the

British Museum. I have mentioned above that in a small collection such an

arrangement may be feasible to a certain degree ; but in a large collection you can-

not place skins, bones, spirit-preparations, and stones in the same room, or, perhaps,

in the same case, exposing them to the same conditions of light and temperature,

without injuring either the one or the other. IZach. liind of those objects requires for

its preservation special considerations and special mani])ulations and by represent-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

ing them in each of the several departments, you would have to double your staff of

skilled manipulators with their apparatus, which means multiplying your expenses.

Departmental administration generally, and especially the system of acquisition

by purchase or exchange, would become extremely complicated, and could not be

carried on without a considerably greater expenditure in time and monej'. Thus,

even if the old departmental division were abandoned for one corresponding to the

principal classes of the animal kingdom, each of the new departments would still

continue to keep, for consideration of conservation, those different kinds of objects,

at least locally, separate. The necessity of this has been so much felt in the British

Museum, that the Trustees resolved to store the spirit-specimens at South Ken-

sington, in a building specially adapted for the purpose, and separated from the

main building, as the accumulation of many thousand gallons of spirits is a source

of danger which not many years ago threatened the destruction of a portion of the

present building in Bloomsbury.

1 could never see that by the juxtaposition of extinct and living animals the

student would obtain particular facilities for study, or that the general public

would derive greater benefit than thej' may obtain, if so inclined, from one of the

numerous popular books ; they would not be much the wiser if the Archaopteryx
were placed in a passage leading from the reptile- to the bird-gallery. And it cer-

tainly cannot be said that the separation of living and extinct organisms so univer-

sally adopted in the old museums, has been a hindrance to the progress of our

knowledge of the development of the organic world. This knowledge originated

and advanced in spite of museums-arrangements. What lies at the bottom of the

desire for such a change amounts, in reality, to this, that museums should be the

practical exponents of the principle that zoologists and botanists should not be

satisfied with the study of the recent fauna and flora, and that paleeontologists

shoidd not begin their studies or carry on their researches without due and full

reference to living forms. To this principle ever}'' biologist will most heartily sub-
scribe ; but the local separation of the various collections in the British Museum
will not offer any obstacles whatever to its being carried out. The student can

take the specimens (if not too bulky) from             one department  to  the  other                         he  may
                                                                                                           ;

examine them in the gallery without interference on the part of the public ; or he

may have all brought to a private study, and, in fact, be in the same position with

Aregard to the use of the collections as those who have charge of them.                                           plan

which has been already initiated in the old building will probably be further

developed in the new, viz., to distribute in the palseontological series such examples

of important living types as will aid the visitor in comprehending the nature and

affinities of the creatures of which he sees only the fragmentary remains.

With regard to the further arrangement of the collections in the new building, it

has been long understood that the exhibition of all the species, or even the majority of

them, is a mistake ; find that, therefore, two series of specimens should be formed, viz.,

--one for the purposes of advanced scientific study the study-series ; and the other

comprising specimens illustrative of the leading points both of popular and scientific

-- --interest ; this latter the exhibition-series being intended to supply the require-

ments of the beginner in the study of natural history, and of the public. As the

zoological collections are better adapted for exhibition than the others, the follow-

ing remarks refer principally to them. The bulk of our present exhibition-series is

the growth of many years, and to convert it into one which fulfils its proper

purpose, is a gradual and slow process ; nor can it be expected to reveal its character

until it has been removed into the new locality. The exhibition will probably

be found more liberal than may ',be deemed necessary by some of my fellow-

labourers                                              but if a visitor should, on leaving the galleries, ' take nothing with him
                                                    ;

but sore feet, a bad headache, and a general idea that the animal kingdom is a

mighty maze without plan,' I should be inclined to believe that this state of bodily

and mental prostration is the visitor's, and not the curator's fault. The very fact

that the exhibition-series is intended for a great variety of people, renders it

necessary to make a liberal selection of specimens, and I simply follow the principle

of placing in it all those objects which, in my opinion, the public can understand and

appreciate, and which therefore must contribute towards instruction. The public
would receive but an inadequate return for keeping up a National Museum if they

were shown, for instance, a dozen so-called ' types ' of the family of parrots or

humming birds ; they require a good many more to see what Nature can produce

in splendour and variation of colour, in grotesqueness of form ; or to learn that

whilst one of these groups of birds is spread all over the countries of the tropical

                                                       Qci2

zone, the other is limited to a portion of a single continent. To render sucli an

exhibition thoroughly useful, two additional helps are required, viz. a complete

system of explanatory labels, and a popularly written and well-illustrated hand-

book, which should not only serve as a guide to the more important and interesting

specimens, but give a systematic outline of the all-wise plan which we endeavour to

trace in God's creation.

There is one part of the Museum which I intend to treat in a different manner

from the rest, and that is the collection of British animals. For the same rea-
sons for which I have in a former part of this address insisted on District Faunas

being fully represented in Provincial Museums, I consider a complete exhibition of
the British Fauna to be one of the most important objects of the National Museum.
It:) formation is, strange as it may appear to many of you, still a desideratum, and
a task which will occupy many years. It will not be easy (especially when you are in
danger of infringing an Act of Parliament), to form a complete series of British
birds showing their changes of plumage, their young, their eggs, their mode of
nidification ; it is a long work to collect the larvie and chrysalides of insects,

and to mount the caterpillars with their food-plants; and we shall require the
co-operation of many a member of the British Association when we extend the

collection to the marine animals and their metamorphoses. But all the trouble,

time, and labour spent will be amply repaid by the direct benefits which all classes

^ill derive from such a complete British collection.

    My time is becoming short, and yet I find that I am far from having completed

the task I had set to myself. Therefore let me briefly refer only to a few points
which of late have much agitated those Avho feel a direct or indirect interest in

the progress of the National Museum.

In the first place we must feel deeply concerned in everything relating to the

conservation of the collections. If the objects could speak to you as they do to

those familiar with their history, many of them would tell you of the long hours

                                                             upon  them                             many
--of                                                                                             ;
patient     inquiry spent                                                                                 might  point  with  pride  at the  long

pages written about them alas ! not always with the even temper which renders

the study of natural science a delight and a blessing ; others would remind you of
having been objects of your wonder when you saw them depicted in scientific
books, or in some household work ; whilst not a few could tell you pitiful tales of

the enthusiastic collector who, bra^·ing the dangers of a foreign cHmate, sacrificed

health or life to his favourite pursuit. Collections thus obtained, thus cherished,

representing the labours of thousands of men, and intended to instruct hundreds of

thousands, are worth preserving, displaying, and cultivating. No cost has been

spared  in  housing  them                                    let   no  cost be spared in                         providing proper fittings   to

receive them, a sufficient staft' to look after them, and the necessary books to study

them.

"What we chiefly require in a well-constructed exhibition-case is that it should

be as perfectly dust-proof as possible, that it should lock well and easily, and yet

that it should be of a light structure. Everyone who has gone through a gallery
of our old-fashioned museums, must have noticed how much those broad longi-

tudinal and transverse bars of the wooden frame of the front of a case interfere

with the inspection of the objects behind them, hiding a head here, a tail there, or
cutting an animal into two more or less unequal portions. Ill-constructed cases

have brought zoological collections as mucli into bad repute as bad stuffers ; and
if it be thought that a pound could be saved in the construction of a case, that

pound will probably entail a permanent expense of a pound a year. Now, all the

requisites of a good exhibition case can be obtained by using metal wherever it

can be substituted for wood ; and, although its use is more expensive than that of
wood, you will join with me in the hope that no mistaken desire of economy will
prevail now as the time has arrived to furnish our priceless collections with

adequate fittings.

TProbably all of those present are aware that the formation of a Natural History

Library has been urged almost from the very first day on which the removal of

the Natural History collections to South Kensington was proposed. But the cost

and extent of such a library have been very variously estimated. And I am
                                                                                                                                             a

sorry to say that it is, I believe, owing to expressions of opinion on the part of

those who ought to know hetter, that the cost of this library was considerably

Weunderrated when the removal to South Kensington was determined upon.

cannot blame the Government that they hesitated for years before they acceded to
the pressing representations of the Trustees of the British Museum, to begin with

its formation, when they were told by naturalists that the corf of such a library

would be something between 10,000/. and 20,000/. I could nardly believe my

eyes when I read only a few weeks ago in the leader of a weekly periodical

specially devoted to science, ' that had the Trustees put aside a thousand a year

for this purpose when it was first determined to remove the Natural History col-

lections ten years ago, there would have been by this time in existence a library

fully adequate to the purpose.' The writer must have either a very poor idea of
the objects and work of a National Museum, or an imperl^ect knowledge of the

extent of the literature of Natural History. 10,000/. might suffice to purchase a

good ornithological library, and 1 ,000/. would purchase the annual additions to all

the various branches of  natural history                                                                        but  the former  sum  would  be much too
                                                                                                             ;

small if the purchase of those works only were intended which are required for
Athe technical work of naming animals, plants, fossils, and minerals.
                                                                                                                                             hetter cal-

culation was made by the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the

British Museum in 1860, who stated that 'the formation of a Natural History

Library would cost about 30,000/. at the present time ' (1860). Considering that
twenty years have elapsed since, and that this part of the literature has shown

year by year a steady increase, we must put our estimate considerably higher than

the writer of that article.

    With the aid of some of my friends who know, from their daily occupation, the

market value of Natural History works, I made a calculation some years ago,

and we came to the conclusion that a complete Natural History Library will
cost 70,000/. : and, irapalatable as this statement may be to those who have advo-

cated the removal of the Natural History collections, and therefore, must be held

responsible for this concomitant expense, it Avill be found to be true. It will

be satisfactory to you to learn that the Government have at last sanctioned the

expenditure of half that amount.

    Now, in my opinion, such a librarj^ formed in connection with the National

Museum, should not be reserved for the use of the officials, but I would recommend
that it should be accessible to the general class of students in the same manner as
any other part of the collections. It is for this reason that I wish to see it rendered
as perfect as possible with respect to the older publications (many of which are
getting scarcer year by year), as well as to the most recent. Whether or not_
similarly perfect collection of Natural History books exists in some other place in

London, is another question with which I am not concerned. The general

National Library evidently ought to contain a perfect set of books on Natural

History, irrespective of other claims ; but to have Natural History collections in
one place, and the books relating to them in another miles away, will produce as

much inconvenience as is experienced T^y the person who puts the powder into

the one barrel of his gun and the shot into the other.

If the British Museum (for the collections will remain united under this old

time-honoured name, though locally separated) continues to receive that support

from the Government to which it is justly entitled, I have no doubt that it will not

only fulfil all the aims of a National Collection, but that it will be also able to give
to the kindred provincial institutions the aid which has recently been claimed on

their behalf. Under au Act of Parliament which was passed in the previous

session, and which empowers the Trustees to part with duplicate specimens, several
of those museums have already received collections of zoological objects. But I

consider it my duty to caution those who are in charge of those Museums to be

careful as to the manner in which thej' avail themselves of this opportunity. W^ell-
preserved duplicates of the rarer and more valuable vertebrate animals are very
scarce in the British Museum, the funds for purchase being much too small to permit

the acquisition of duplicates. What we possess of this kind of duplicates are

generally deteriorated specimens, and therefore ought not to be received by Pro-
598 KEPORT-- 1880.

vincial Museums. On tlie other hand, our invertebrate series, especially of Mollusks

and Insects, will always offer a certain number of well-preserved duplicate specimens

and a sufficient inducement for Provincial Museums to select their desiderata.

It has been su^^gested that, as the British Museum has correspondents and col-

lectors in almost every part of the globe, and has, therefore, greater facilities for

obtaining specimens than any other institution, it should systematically acquire

duplicates, and form a central repository, from which Provincial Museums could

draw their supplies. If the necessary funds to carry out this scheme were granted,

I cannot see any objection to it on the part of the British Museum, which, on

the contrary, would probably derive some benefit. But there is' one, and in my

opinion a very serious, objection, viz. that this scheme would open the door to the

employment of curators of inferior qualifications ; it would relieve the curator of a

Provincial Museum of an important part of his duty, viz. to study for himself the

requirements of his Museum, the means of meeting them, and to become well ac-

Aquainted with the objects themselves.  curator who has to be satisfied with the

mechanical work of displaying and preserving objects acquired, prepared and named

for him by others, takes less interest in the progress of his Museum than he whose

duty it would be to form a collection ; he is not the person in whose charge the
Museum will flourish.

In speaking of the claims of Provincial Museums on the National Museum, the

Wekindred Colonial institutions should not be forgotten.  owe to them much of our

knowledge of the Natural History of the Colonies ; they are the repositories of the

collections of the temporary and permanent surveys which have been instituted in

connection with them, and they have concentrated and preserved the results of

manifold individual efforts which otherwise most likely would have been lost to

science. The British Museum has derived great benefit from the friendly relations

which we have kept up with them and, therefore, they are deserving of aU the
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

aid which we can possibly give them, and which may lessen the peculiar difficulties

Tinder which they labour in consequence of their distance from Europe.

    I am painfully aware that in the remarks which I have had the honour of

making before you, I have tried the patience of some, and not satisfied the expecta-

--tions of others. But so much I may claim : that the views which I have expressed

                          5. Oh tltc Development of Jjepiilostens. .

                By F. M. Balfoue, F.B.S., and W. N. Parkek.

      The paper contained an account of tlie observations of the authors on some pre-
. served material supplied to them hy Al. Agassiz. The following are the chief
 points to which attention was called :

      (1) The segmentation is complete as in the Sturgeon, hut the segments at the
lower pole of the ovum soon fuse into a single mass which forms the yolk sack.

      (2) The epiblast is divided into a nervous and an epidermic layer.
      (3) The cerebro-spinal cord is formed, from a solid keel-like thickening of the
 epiblast, as in Teleostei and Petromyzon. In this respect Lepidosteus contrasts
strilcingly with the Sturgeon, in which the cerebro-spinal cord is formed in the usual

 vertebrfite fashion.

       (4) There is a pronephros (head-kidney) of the Teleostean type.

     The authors further called attention to the structure and homologies of a pro-
visional suctorial disc in front of the mouth, of which Agassiz has already given an

account.

6. On the Classification of Cryptogams} By Alfred W. Bennett, M.A.,

            B.Sc, F.L.8., Lecturer on Botany at St. Thomas's Hospital.

      In the most recent classification of cryptogams, that by Sachs, in the 4th ed.
 of his ' Lehrbuch,' he divides thallophytes (including characeaj) into four classes of
equal rank, Protophyta, Zygosporete, Oosporete, and Oarposporere. It is proposed
in the present paper to retain Sachs's class of Protophyta for the lowest forms of
vegetable life ; but to restore the primary division of the remainder of thallophytes
into fungi and algte, as being more convenient to the student and at least as much
in accordance with probable genetic affinities.

     As regards minor points, the characete are removed altogether from thallo-
phytes, and again constituted into a separate group of the first rank ; the myxo-

mycetes are regarded as presenting a low type of structure, scarcely raised above
the protophyta, and not exhibiting true sexual conjugation ; volvox and its allies
are removed from the zygosporete to the oosporese; and the phaeosporeae are
.separated off as a distinct order from the fucacere.

   --The thallophytes are therefore iirst of all divided into three primary classes :

Protophyta, Fungi, and Alg^e. The protophyta are divisible into two sub-
classes, Protomycetes and Frotophycece. The protomycetes consist of a single
order, the Schizomycetes, of which saccharomyces is regarded as an aberrant
form. The protophycejB are composed of the protococcacese (including palmellacese
and scytonemacere), nostocacefe, oscillatoriese, and rivulariese. The Myxmnycetes
are treated as a supplement to the protophyta. The fungi are made up of three
sub-classes, employing in the main the same characters as Sachs, but, in their
terminology, using the syllable 'sperm ' instead of 'spore.' The first division, the
Zyyomycet.es (or zj'gospermete achloropliyllace£e), is composed of the mucorini
only (including the piptocephalidfe). The second, the Oomycetes (or oospermese

achlorophyllacece), comprises the peronosporete aiid saprolegniese (including the

chytridiaceoe). The third, the Carpomycetes (or carpospermese achlorophyllace.'e),
is made up of the uredinese, ustilagineie, basidiomycetes, and ascomycetes, the
lichenes being included in the last as a sub-order. The algfe are arranged under
three corresponding sub-classes. The Zyyophycece (or zj-gospermete chloro-

--phyliaceae) is made up of the following orders: Pandorineae, hydrodictyeae, con-

fervacete (under which the pithophoraceae may possibly come), ulotrichaceae,

ulvaceae, botrydieae, .and conjugatae (the last comprising the desmidieae, diato-

maceae, zygnemaceae, and mesocarpeae). The Oophycece (or oospermeae chloro-

phyllaceae) include the volvocinese, siphoneae (with the nearly allied, dasycladeae),

sphseropleaceae, oedogoniacese, fucaceae, and pbteosporeae. The Curpophycea (or
carpospermeas chlorophyllacefe) is made up of the coleochaetefe and floridece.

     The CHAEACE.i; constitute by themselves a group of primary importance. The
MusciNE^E are unchanged, comprising the Hepaticee and Miisci (including sphag-
naceae). lu "S'asculae Cryptogams it is proposed to revert to the primary dis-
tinction mio Isosporia and ffeterosporia, as most in accordance -with probable
genetic affinities. The isosporia consist of the filices (including ophioglossacese),
lycopodiacese, and equisetacese. The heterosporia comprise the rhizocarpese and

selaginellacepe. In the terminology of the heterosporia the inconvenience and

incorrectness are pointed out of the use of the terms 'macrospore' and 'macro-
sporangium '; and it is proposed to call the two kinds of spores and their recep-

tacles respectively microsjMre, mcffospore, microsporanffium, and megasporanyium

7. A Reformed System of Terminology of the Beproductive Organic of
     Tliallophjtes} By Alfred W. Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S., Lecturer

      on Botany at St. Thomas's Hospital, and George Murray, F.L.S.,

      Assistant, Botanical Department, British Museum.

After giving illustrations of the present chaotic state of cryptogamic termi-

nology, the authors proceed to state that the object they have kept in view is to

arrive at a system v*'hicli shall be symmetrical and in accordance with the state of

knowledge, and which shall at the* same time interfere as little as possible with
Aexisting terms.
                                                                     few new terms are introduced, but the total number is greatly

reduced.

     In the 4th edition of his ' Lehrbuch/ Sachs defines a 'spore' as 'a reproductive

cell produced directly or indirectly by an act of fertilisation,' reserving the term

' gonidium' for those reproductive cells which are produced without any previous

act of impregnation. The practical objections to this limitation of "terms are

pointed out, and it is proposed to restore the term spore to what has been in the

main hitherto its ordinary signification, viz., any cell jyroduced by ordinary processes

of vegetation and not by a union of sexual elements, which becomes detached for the

2}urpose of direct vegetative reproduction. The spore may be the result of ordinary

cell-division or of free cell-formation. In certain cases (zoospores) its first stage is

that of a naked                                                  mass of protoplasm                                                                            in rare  instances        it is  multicellular, breakiug
                                                                                                                                                            ;

up into a number of cells (polyspores, composed of merispores, or breaking up

into sporidln). Throughout thallophytes the term is used iu the form of one of

numerous compounds expressive of the special character of the organ in the class

in question. Thus, in the protophyta and mucorini we have chlamydospores ; in the

myxomycetes, sporangiospores ; in the peronosporese, conidiospores ; in the sapro-

legniese, oophycere, and                                                  some  zygOTphyceve, zoospores                                                                                  in the medmeve, teleutospores,

     In the terminology of the male fecundating organs very little change is
necessary. The cell or more complicated structure in which the male element is
formed is uniformly termed an antherldlirm, the ciliated fecundating bodies

antherozolds (in preference to ' spermatozcids '). In the florideas and lichenes,
the fecundating bodies are destitute of vibratile cilia : in the former case they are

still usually termed ' antherozolds,' in the latter ' spermatia,' and their receptacles

* spermogonia.' In order to mark the difference in structure from true anthero-

zolds, it is proposed to designate these motionless bodies in both cases pollinoids

  the term ' spermogoniuni ' is altogether unnecessary, the organ heing a true
  antheridium.

        A. satisfactory terminology of the female reproductive organs presents greater

  difficulties. The limits placed to the use of the term spore and its compounds
 require the atandonment of ' oospore ' for the fertilised oosphere in its encysted
  stage anterior to its segmentation into the embryo. The authors propose the
  syllable sperm as the basis of the various terms applied to all those bodies which
  are the immediate result of impregnation. It is believed that this will be found to
  supply the basis of a symmetrical system of terminology which will go far to
  redeem the confusion that at present meets the student at the outset of his-
  researches. For the unfertilised female protoplasmic mass, it is proposed to retain
  the term oosphere, and to establish from it a corresponding series of terms ending-
 in sphei'e. The entire female organ before fertilisation, whether unicellular or
 multicellular, is designated by a set of terms ending in gmiium.

       In the zygomycetes and zygophycese, the conjugated zygospheres, or contents of
 the zygogonia, constitute a zygosperm ; in the oomycetes and oophycese the fer-
 tilised oosphere, or contents of the oogonium, is an oosperm ; in the carpophycea&
 the fertilised carposphere, or contents of the carpogonium, constitutes a carposperm.
 In this last class the process is complicated, being effected by means of a special

 female organ which may be called the trichogonium (in preference to ' trichogyne').
 The ultimate result of impregnation is the production of a mass of tissue known as

 the cystocarp (or ' sporocarp '), within which are produced the germinating bodies
 which must be designated carpospores, since they are not the direct results of

 fertilisation. Any one of these bodies which remains in a dormant condition for

 a time before germinating is a hypnosperm. In the cormophytes (characeae, musci-
 neae, and vascular cryptogams) the fertilised archesphere, or contents of the arche-
gonium, is an archesperm. In the proposed system zygosperm will replace Stras-
 burger's ' zygote,' and the ' gametes ' of the same writer Avill be zygospheres, his
 ' zoogametes ' or ' planogametes ' being zoozygospheres.

      In the basidiomycetes, ascomycetes, and some other classes, it is proposed to-
 substitute the term fructijication for ' receptacle,' for the entire non-sexual genera-
tion which bears the spores.

    A list is appended of the terms in more frequent use which are disused in the'

proposed system.

     This reduces the number of supposed exclusively Mediterranean species from
222 to 181 ; and it must be borne in mind that the Atlantic Nudibranchs and
Cephalopods have never been completely worked out. Philippi's list of Mediter-
ranean Nudibranchs and Verany's list of Mediterranean Cephalopods amoimt to 58

^nt of the above residue of 181. When further researches by dredging have been

made in the North Atlantic, I believe the difference between the Mollusca in
that extensive ocean and in the Mediterranean will be still more diminished, if it
do not in time altogether disappear.

                             2. The Cruise of the 'Knight Errant.'

                 By Professor Sir C. Wytille Thomson, F.B.S.

     This paper was mainly phj-sical, and related to the temperature-conditions of
the sea-bed lying between our northern coasts and the Faroe Isles, Certain parts
of this submarine district had been ascertained by the author and Dr. Carpenter
during the cruises of the Lightning and Porciqnne in 1868 and 1869 to have
remarkably different temperatures; and they had distinguished these parts by the
names 'cold area' and 'warm area.' It had been inferred from observations in
H.M.S. Challenger that the phenomenon depended in this and similar cases upon
the interruption of the flow of the undercm-rent by a raised submarine ridge.

     The author, beuig desu-ous of working out this problem more completely, ap-
plied to the Admiralty for the use of a surveying vessel ; and, in compliance with

his request, the Xnight Errant was placed this summer at his disposal. Two

sectional lines of soimdings were taken at an average intermediate distance of ten
miles. The following were the results :
604 REPORT-- 1880.

      The weather, however, was unfavourable ; and the author expressed a hope
that the exploration miglit be renewed next summer, in order to examine the faiuia
on the northern slope of the Scotch coast, which had been proved to be very-
abundant and peculiar.'

    3. On the Relation of the Lepidoptera of Great Britain to those of other
                         Countries. By Captain H. J. Elwes.

     The author pointed out that Great Britain is very poor in the number of specie3
of butterflies, compared with almost any part of the Palaearctic region, but is rela-
tively much more rich in moths, though deficient in some of the day-flying genera.
Secondly, that the number of species in any part of Europe is proportionately
greater near the south coast, though in France, Italy, and Austria, the numbei-s are
much increased by a large proportion of purely Alpine forms. Thirdly, that the
generic character of the butterflies remains unchanged throughout North Asia and
North America, though in the former case there is a considerable infusion of Oriental
forms in Japan and North-east Asia ; whilst in the southern and warmer parts of
the United States are found many species belonging to neotropical genera mixed up
with species belonging to the domuiant Palsearctic groups. But on the whole, the
butterflies of the United States, and especially of Colorado, are very nearly allied
to those of E^lrope, and the differences are not enough to separate the two region;*,

so far as butterflies ai'e concerned.

                          6. Oil the ' Drumming ' of the Snipe.

                 By Captain W. V. Legge, iiJ.i., F.L.8., F.Z.S.

     The writer spoke of the interest taken in the snipe's breeding habits, owing to its
being such a favourite bird, and to the fact of its disposition during the nesting
season being demonstrative and excitable, the very opposite of what it is at other
times. Reference was made to the extraordinary noise made by the bu-d when
flj'ing over its nest or young, to the variety of opinion as to its origin, and to Herr
Meeves's paper, published in the ' Proceedings of the London Zoological Society,'
1858, in which a very ingenious theory was propounded, .setting forth the idea
that the noise was made by the vibration of the outer tail feather. Herr Meeves's
reasons for his theory were alluded to, and his experiment with the tail feather?
of the snipe, tied to a wire and stick, and moved through the air, was repeated by
the writer, who also gare a description of the feathers in the bird's tail. Mr.
Hancock's paper, in the * Catalogue of the Birds of Northumberland and Durham,' was
then reviewed, and its author's opinion that the ' drumming ' was made alone by the
wings commented upon, as well as his refutation of llerr Meeves's theory noticed.
In support of Mr. Hancock's argument that the isolated tail-feather attached to the
wire but feebly represents the same feather in its place in the living bird, the writer
demonstrated that though a peculiar noise, somewhat like the vibrations heard
during the ' drumming ' of the snipe, could be made when the feather was moved
to and fro with a radius of motion of 4 or 5 feet, it was not possible to produce the
same sound when the feather was moved with a radius of only ^\ inches, which
would be all that it would have in the living bird. Mi'. Hancock's statements that
the bird descended with firm-set tremulous wings was, however, contradicted by

     ' The original p.npcr lias been published in full in Nature for September 2,

tlie writer, who went on to relate liis ov^^l experiences, and gave an account of
observations he had made this summer on the bogs of Central Wales. An instance
was mentioned in which a snipe, on a still evening in June last, had drummed for

 iifty minutes, flying roimd the writer's head, and this very favourable opportunitj-
 had enabled the closest observations to be made. The actions of the bird were
 minutely described, and it was shown that in the downwai-d sweep of the bird,
 when it ' drimimed,' the wings were beaten very rapidly \\'ith regular strokes, and
 the vibratory sounds falling on the ear at the time were exactly coincident tvit.h
 those strokes ; at the same time the tail was spread out like a fan, and the writer
contended that the soimd was produced by the air being driven by the wings at

each stroke through the rigid feathers of the tail, as when they are blown on with
witli quick puffs, emitted from the lips, a sound resembling the ' drumming ' noise is
heard. Were the sound produced alone by the wings, it would be heard continually

throughout the bird's aerial course ; but as this is not the case, it can only be due

to the combined action of the wings and tail, when the latter is spread.

7. On the Migration of Birds, and Messrs. Brown and Cordeaux's Method of
    obtaining Systematic Observations of the same at Lighthouses and Light-
   ships. By Alfred Newton, M.A., F.B.S.

     Citing a passage from an article by the Duke of Argyll (' Contemporary Review,'
July 1880, p. 1), the author met with a direct denial the Duke's assertion that of
'the army of the birds 'it may be said that 'it cometh not with observation,'
pointing oiit that all we know of the migration of birds arises from observation,
and all we do not know, from the want of it ; remarking, also, that if it were not
for observation, we should not know that birds migrate at all, and that it is by
renewed observation alone that we can hope to know more of their mio-raton'
movements. The author then proceeded to describe briefly the nocturnal passage
of birds, as noticed by himself at Cambridge for the past seventeen years, and urged
the importance of similar but more systematic observations at other stations.
Remarking upon the especial advantages of lighthouses and lightships for this
purpose, he called attention to the successful attempt made last year, with the
sanction of the authorities of the Trinity House and the Commissioners of Northern
Lights, by Mr. J. A. Har\'ie Brown and Mr. Cordeaux, to obtain a series of obser-
vations from the lighthouses and lightships on the coasts of Scotland and the east
coast of England, the results of which were embodied by those gentlemen in a

Report (printed in the ' Zoologist ' for May 1880), and showed that returns were

received from two-thirds of the English stations, and as regards the Scottish, from
about two-thirds of those on the west, and one-half of those on the east coast, thus

evincing the intelligent interest taken by the men there employed in the inquiiy.
This .single report naturally did not throw any new light on the subject ; but it

would be contrary to all experience if a series of such reports did not do so, and
lie tlierefore urged the Association to lend its countenance to the renewed attempts
which Messrs. Brown and Cordeaiux were making, and to encourage with its

--approval those gentlemen and theu- fellow-workers the men of the lighthouses
--and lightships who would best answer the question, whether knowledge of the

subject ' Cometh not with observation.'

                        By P. L. Sclater, 'M.A. Ph.D., F.R.S.

The author commenced by a «hort account of the principal modes of arranging the

Class of Bii"ds put forward by naturalists since the days of Linnaeus, who, in the
first edition of the ' Systema Naturae' (1766), had divided them into six orders (table
i). This had been quite superseded in 1817 by the more natural system propounded by
Cuvier in his ' Regne Animal' (table ii.) which, with slight modifications, had met

-- --with almost universal adoption at least in this coimtry up to a recent period. In

spite of the assaults made upon it by the anatomists and osteologists of Germany,

and notwithstanding, in particular, the advanced views of Nitzsch, put forward in his
various wi'itings (see table iii.) and especially in his celebrated ' Pterylography,' in
which the mode of arrangement of the feathers on the bodies of birds was first pro-
posed to be taken into consideration, the Cuvierian system had held its ovra, and
in fact was still in use by the great majority of ornithologists. About twelve years
ago, however, Prof. Huxley had taken up the subject of the classification of Birds

in his usual zealous and original way, and from quite a new point of view. Prof.

Huxley, treating birds mainly from their bones and as if they were extinct animals
of which these parts of their structure only were known, had proposed an entirely

new plan of arrangement (table iv.), based mainly upon the characteristic variations
of the palatal bones, which had passed almost unnoticed by previous writers. The
author, who had long been dissatisfied with the Cuvierian system, which with
certain modifications he had employed up to 1872, had in that year been constrained
to consider the whole subject iu order to decide what arrangement should be
adopted in the ' Noinenclator Avium Americanarum ' (a joint work by Mr. 0.

Salvin and himself), then ready for publication. Having, as already stated, long
                                                                                  '

entertained serious doubts as to the validity of tbe Graj-ian arrangement, especially

as to tlie groups associated together in the orders Grallte and Anseres, he had been
pleased to find available an alternative ^vhich had the sanction of high authority.

Whatever might be the case as regards the four principal divisions of the Carinatie,

based solely upon the palatal structure, and upon which sundry more or less eflective

criticisms had been made by subsequent investigators, there seemed to be no doubt

to the author that the minor divisions of the Huxleyan system, by which the

whole class of birds was divided into about 23 families, constituted a much more

natural system than that of C'uvier and his followers. Prof. Huxley had commenced

his system with the lowest and most reptilian birds, and had ended it with the

highest and most specialized. But it seemed to the author that by exactly re-

versinf' this arrangement he would obtain a scheme which would not very far

deviate from that which he had previously employed for the first three orders,

and would oiFer many improvements on the Grayian system in the remaining ones.

Such a scheme had accordingly been promulgated in the Introduction to the

'Nomenclator' and had been used in that work. In the various subsequently issued

editions of the 'List of Vertebrated Animals in the Zoological Society's Gardens
Aa nearly similar arrangement had been followed.
                                                  certain amount of adhesion

ha\dng been secured to this system, the author had been recently induced to devote

some laboiu- to its improvement and development. As now elaborated it did not

profess to be in any respects original, except as regarded certain small details ou

points to which he had devoted special attention. The arrangement was in fact

simply that of Huxley reversed, with slight modifications consequent upon the

recent researches of Parker and Garrod on the anatomy and osteology of little

known forms. .

The author then proceeded to explain further the ' Systema Avium ' thus ad-

vocated, as shown in the subjoined table, in which the approximate number of

known species was added after each order.

       THURSDAY, AUGUST 20.

The Chairman delivered the following Address:

After an ahsence of more than thirty years the British -Vssociation has again

assembled in South Wales. To the student of anthropology it is always refresh-

ing to visit a province of the United Kingdom in which the inhabitants still retain,

in large measure, their peculiarities of language and of race. But in that part of

the Principality which we are now ^ isiting, these characteristics have for many

generations been growing fainter and fainter. In fact the local circumstances

which render a meeting of the British Association possible are precisely those

cii'cumstances which tend to obliterate ethnical distinctions. The material pros-

perity of any locality naturally draws towards it a stream of immigration from less

prosperous districts, and thus produces an artificial mixture of population. If the

influx into Swansea had come only from the agricultural parts of Wales, there

would have been comparatively little  ethnical  confusion                                       but, as a matter of  fact,
                                                                                             ;

all the large towns of Glamorganshire, such as Swansea, Cardiff, and Merthyr,

have received strong accessions to their population from -v arious parts of England

and of Ireland. The anthropologist would, therefore, be ill advised if he resorted

to any of these flourishing centres for the purpose of studying the typical Welsh-

man.

Glamorganshire probably contains, at the present time, more than one-third of

the entire population of Wales yet the area of the county is but little more than
                                                                                                                                                ;

one-ninth of the total area of the Principality.' This concentration of the people

is due, directly or indirectly, to the gigantic development of those mining and

           ' At the last census the population of Glamorgansliire was :ii)7,859, and that of

the entire Principality only 1,216,775. The area of Glamorganshire is estimated to

be about 547,070 acres, while tlie total area of Wales is said to be 4,722,323 acres.

metallurgical industries -which are centred in this county. The temptation of
hio'h wages, offered in seasons of prosperity, lias attracted hither a large number
of settlers from different parts of the United Kingdom. Occasionally, too, recourse
has heen had to the technical skill of foreigners ; and thus ethnical elements have
been introduced, to a limited extent, from outside the British Isles. Even the
typical industries of the district have not always been of indigenous growth.
Colonel Grant-Francis, who acted at the Swansea meeting of 1848 as secretary to

the ethnological sub-section, the equivalent of our present anthropological depart-

--ment, has written an interesting history of Welsh copper-smelting,' an industry

which is pre-eminently characteristic of the Swansea district. It appears from
this historical sketch that the art was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth
by * that very honest and skUfuU man,' Ulricke Frosse, and his ' Right worshipfull
and very singuler good M'r," Thomas Smith. The verj^ names mentioned here as
those of the founders of the industry indicate a commingling of nationalities which
is typical of what so frequently occurs in our great manufacturing districts, to the
undeniable benefit of society at large, but nevertheless to the embarrassment of the

anthropologist.

     It is worth while noting that the movement of population towards South
Wales has been mainly determined by the geological structure of the district. It
was the occurrence of coal that originally tempted Ulricke Frosse to bring his cargo
of copper-ore across from Cornwall to be smelted in the Vale of Neath ; and it is
still the working of coal which maintains the local industries and supports the
vast population of Glamorganshire. The connection between the geological struc-
ture of a district and the social and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants has
been recognized by no one more clearly than by the distinguished geologist who
is presiding over the present meeting of this Association.

    Had it not been for the abundant occurrence of coal and iron ores in South
Wales, the land of Morganwg might have been at the present day a peaceful agri-

cidtural district. But even then the ethnologist would have found it hard to study
the racial characteristics of its native population aloof from all disturbing in-
fluences. For it is matter of history that as far back as the twelfth century
South Wales was colonized at several points by Flemish settlers. Most of these
colonists settled in Pembrokeshire, where they helped to disturb the ethnology of
the county, and ultimately obliterated from certain districts most of the Welsh
characteristics.^ Their Low-Dutch speech would be readily assimilated with the
English, while it refused to blend with the Welsh, and thus the English-speaking

--people remained sharply separated from their Welsh-speaking neighbours the

' Englishry ' distinct from the ' Welshery.' Possibly the Teutonic element may be
partly due to an earlier settlement of Northmen.' Camden mentions the English-
speaking part of Pembrokeshire under the name of Anglia Transivalliana, and

everyone knows that it is still referred to as ' Little England beyond Wales.'
     It is generally supposed that what took place in Pembrokeshire was repeated

on a smaller scale in the promontory of Gower, and thus it happens that we still
find ' Flemings ' in the immediate neighbourhood of Swansea. The EngUsh-
speaking people of Gower,^ composed probably of Norse, Flemish, Norman, and

English elements, were so distinct from the neighbouring Welsh, that the districts

inbaWtc'd by the two uationalities are often distinguished iu old records as Goxcer
An<ilicana and Goiver Wallicana} But, I believe that the barriers between the
two peojoles have in modern times been considerably relaxed, and that there is at
the present day more or less intermixture of blood.

      Apart, however, from all foreign admixture, there is still in Glamorganshire,

especially in the outlying districts, a very large proportion of the population who may
be fairly regarded as typically Welsh. If we can strip off" all extraneous elements
which have been introduced by the modern settler and the medieval Fleming,
possibly also by the Norman baron and even the Roman soldier, we may eventually

--lay bare for anthropological study the deep-lying stratum of the population the

original Welsh element. What then are the ethnical relations of the typical man

of South Wales ?

    Nine people out of every ten to whom this question might be addressed would
unhesitatingly answer that the true Welsh are Celts or Kelts.'^ And they would
seek to justify their answer by a confident appeal to the AVelsh language. No one

has any doubt about the position of this language as a member of the Keltic
family. The Welsh and the Breton fall naturally together as living members of a
group of languages to which Professor Rhys applies the term Brythonic, a group
which also includes such fossil tongues as the old Cornish, the speech of the

Strathclyde Britons, and possibly the languages of the Picts and of the Gauls.

On the other hand, the Gaelic of Scotland, the Irish, and the Manx arrange them-
selves as naturally in another group, which Professor Rhys distingiushes as the

Goidelic branch of the Keltic stock. ^ But does it necessarily follow that all the
peoples who are closely linked together by speaking, or by having at some time
spoken, these Keltic languages, are as closely linked together by ties of blood ?

Great as the value of language unquestionably is as an aid to ethnological classi-

fication, are we quite safe in concluding that all the Keltic-speaking peoples are

one in race ?

     The answer to such a question must needs depend upon the sense in which the
anthropologist uses the word Kelt. History and tradition, philology and ethnology,

archaeology and craniology, have at different times given widely divergent defi-
nitions of the term. Sometimes the word has been used with such elasticity as to

cover a multitude of peoples who differ so widely one from another in physical

characteristics that if the hereditary persistence of such qualities counts for any-

thing, they cannot possibly be referred to a common stock. Sometimes, on the

--other hand, the word has been so restricted iu its definition, that it has actually

excluded the most typical of all Kelts the Gaulish Kelts of Cfesar. According

to one authority, the Kelt is short ; according to another tall : one ethnologist
defines him as being dark, another as fair ; this craniologist finds that he has a
long skull, while that one declares that his skull is short. It was no doubt this
ambiguity that led so keen an observer as Dr. Beddoe to remark, nearly fifteen
years ago, that ' Kelt and Keltic are terms which were usefid in their day, but
which have ceased to convey a distinct idea to the minds of modern students.' ·

     - Whether this word sho\ild be written Celt or Kelt seems to be a matter of
scientific indifierence. Probably the balance of opinion among ethnologists is in
the direction of the former rendering. Nevertheless it must be borne in mind that the
word ' celt ' is so commonly used nowadays by writers on prehistoric anthropology
to designate an axe-head, or some such weapon, whether of metal or of stone, that it
is obviously desirable to make the difEerence between the archasological word and
the ethnological term as clear as possible. If ethnologists persist in writing
' Celt,' the two words differ only in the magnitude of an initial, and when spoken
are absolutely indistinguishable. I shall therefore write, as a matter of expediency,
' Kelt.' It may be true, as Mr. Knight Watson has pointed out, that there was
originally no justification for itsing the word 'celt' as the name of a weapon, but it
is too late in the day to attempt to oust so deeply-rooted a word from the vocabulary

of the archfeologists.

     No ftnthropolofrist Las laboured more persistently in eiidoa\ ourino^ to evoke

order out of this Keltic cliaos than the late Paul Broca. . . . Permit a momentary

pause at the mention of one who has so recently and so unexpectedly been lost to
science. By Broca's death anthropology has suffered a loss which is literally-
irreparable, and it would ill become us who are assembled in this department to
mention his name at such a time without a passiug expression of emotion and a
tribute of respect. Let me remind you that it was Broca who not only founded,
but untiringly sustained that brilliant school of Parisian autbropologist«, who have
done so much within the last twenty years to advance the Science of Man. From

the SocifStd d'Anthropologie there sprang, a few years ago, the Ecole d'Anthro-

pologie, an institution officially recognised by tlie State for the cultivation of
anthropological studies. It was in the laboratory of this school, with its admir-
ably arranged museum, and its convenient lecture theatre, that Broca, surrounded

by his pupils, pursued his labours in so devoted a spirit as at last to over-reach the

limits of his strength. Unsparing of himself in work, an eloquent speaker and a

--powerful writer, at once an anatomist, a scholar, and a mathematician Broca,

exercised a singular fascination over the younger men who gathered around him,
and thus the work which he initiated will not be allowed to perish. Fortimately,
he secured in Dr. Topinard a colleague who fully caught the spirit of the master;

but still the master's loss can only be expressed by the one word which I employed

--before ii-reparable

     What, let us ask, was the opinion of this distinguished anthropologist on the

Keltic question ? ' Professor Broca always held that the name of Kelt should be

--strictly limited to the Kelt of positive history to the people, or rather confedera-
--tion of peoples, actually seen by Ctesar in Keltic Gaul and, of course, to their

descendants in the same area. Every schoolboy is fiimiliar with the epitome of
Gaulish ethnologj' given by Julius in his opening chapter. Nothing can be clearer

than his description of the tripartite division of Gaul, and of the separation be-

--tween the three peoples who inhabited the country the Belgre, the Aquitaui, and

the Celtae. Of these three peoples the most important were those Avhom the

Romans called Galli, but who called themselves, as the historian tells us, Celfce.
The country occupied by the Keltic population stretched from the Alps to the

Atlantic in one direction, and from the Seine to the Garonne iu another ; but it is

difficult to find any direct evidence that the Kelts of this area ever crossed into
Britain. Broca refused to apply the name of Kelt to the old inhabitants of Belgic
traul, and as a matter of course he denied it to any of the inhabitants of the

British Isles. AVritiug as late as 1877, in full view of all the arguments which
had been adduced against his opinions, he still said : ' Je continue a soutenir,
jusqu'a preuve du contraire, ce que j'ai avanc(5 il y a douze ans, dans notre
premiere discussion sur les Celtes, savoir, qu'il n'existe aucune preuve, qu'on ait

constats dans les Iles-Britanniques I'existence d'un peuple portant le nom de

Oeltes.'^

      Nevertheless, in discussing the Keltic question with ]M. Henri Martin, he

admitted the convenience, almost the propriety, of referring to all who spoke Keltic
languages as Keltic peoples, though of course he would "not hear of their being
called Kelts. ' On peut tres-bien les nommer les peuples celtiques. Mais il est
entierement faux de les appeler les Celtes, comme on le fait si souvent.' ' As to
the eminent historian himself, I need hardly say that M. Martin adheres to the
popular use of the word Kelt, and even goes so far as to speak of the county in
which we are now assembled as ' le Glamorgan, le pays aujourdhui le plus celtique

de I'Europe.' *

"Whether we use the word Kelt in its wide linguistic sense or in the narrower

sense to which it has been reduced by the French anthropologists, it is important

to remember that the Welsh do not designate, and never have designated them-

selves by this term or by any similar word. Their national name is Cymry, the plural

Myof Cymro.  former colleague, the Rev. Professor Silvan Evans, kindly informs

me that the most probable derivation of this word is from cydr- (the d being

mchanged to for assimilation with the following b, like the n of its Latin cognate

con) and bro ' country,' the old form of which is brog, as found in Allobroya, and
                                                     ,

some other ancient names. The meaning of Cymry is therefore ' fellow-country-

men,' or compatriots. Such a meaning naturally suggests that the name must

--have been assumed in consequence of some foreign invasion possibly when the

Welsh were banded together against either the Romans or the English. If this

       assumption be correct it must be a word of comparatively late origin.

I --At the same time, the similarity between Cymry and Cimbri the name of
    --those dread foes of the Romans whom Marius eventually conquered is so close as

      to naturally suggest a common origin for the two names, if not for the people who

bore the names. ^ The warlike Cimbri have generally been identified with the
people who inhabited the Cimbric peninsula, the Chersonesus Cimbrica, now called
Jutland. Whether they were connected or not with the Kimmerioi, who dwelt in

the valley of the Danube and in the Tauric Chersonesus, or Crimea, is a wider

question with which we are not at the moment concerned. As to the ethnical

relations of the Cimbri, two views have been current, the one regarding them as

of Germanic, the other as of Keltic stock. Canon Rawlinsou, in summing up the

evidence on both sides, believes that the balance of opinion inclines to the Keltic

view.^ These Cimbri are described, however, as having been tall, blue-eyed, and

yellow- or flaxen-haired men. Can we trace anything like these characters in the

Cymry ?

All the evidence which the ethnologist is able to glean from classical writers

with respect to the physical characters and ethnical relations of the ancient in-

habitants of this country, may be put into a nutshell, with room to spare. The

exceeding meagreness of our data from this source will be admitted by anyone

who glances over the passages relating to Britain which are collected in the

Mvnumenta Historica Britannica. As to the people in the south, there is the

well-known statement in Csesar that the maritime parts of Britain, the southern

parts which he personally visited, were peopled by those who had crossed over

from the Belgse, for what purpose we need not inquire. Of the Britons of the

interior, whom he never saw, he merely repeats a popular tradition which repre-

sented them as aborigines.^ They maj', therefore, have been Keltic tribes, akin to

the Celtiof Gaul, though there is nothing in Cresars words to support such a view.

Tacitus, in writing the life of his father-in-law, Agricola, says that the Britons

nearest to Gaul resembled the Gauls.'* If he refers here to the sea-coast tribes in

the south-east of Britain, the comparison must be with the Belgic and not with

the Keltic Gauls. But his subsequent reference to the resemblance between the

sacred rites of the Britons and those of the Gauls suggests that his remarks

may be fairly extended to the inland tribes beyond the limits of the Belgic Britons,

in which case the resembance may be rather with the Gaulish Kelts. Indeed, this

inference, apart from the testimony of language, is the chief evidence upon which

ethnologists have based their conclusion as to the Keltic origin of the Britons.

are but few aud small. It is true that a description of BunduiCaj or Boadicea, has

been left to us by Xijihiline, of Trebizond                                                                                                                                                                                                but  then  it  will  be  objected  that  he

did not write until the twelfth century. Yet it must be remembered that he

merely abridged the works of Dion Cassius, the historian, who wrote a thousand

years earlier, and consequently we have grounds for believing that what Xiphiline

describes is simply a description taken fi-om the lost books of an early historian

who is supposed to have drawn his information from original sources. Now Boadicea

is described in these terms : ' She was of the largest size, most terrible of aspect,

most savage of countenance and harsh of voice, having a profusion of j^ellow hair

which fell down to her hips.' ^ Making due allowance for rhetorical exaggeration,

making allowance too for the fact that in consequence of her royal descent she is

likely to have been above the average stature, and even admitting that she dyed her

--hair, it is yet clear that this British queen must be regarded as belonging to the

xanthous type tall and fair. The tribe of the Iceni, over which this blonde

amazon ruled, is geuerallj' placed beyond the limits of the Belgic Britons; though

some authorities have argued in favour of its Belgic origin. If the latter view be

correct, we should expect the queen to be tall, light-haired, aud blue-eyed ; for,
from what we know of the Belgre, such were their features. Cresar asserts that the

majority of the Belgre were derived from the Germans.'- But notwithstanding this

assertion, most ethnologists are inclined to ally them with the Oelti, without, of

course, denying a strong Teutonic admixture. Strabo says^ that the BelgsB

and Celti had the same Gaulish form, though both differed widely in physical

characters from the Aquitanians. As to language, Oajsar's statement that the

Belgic and Keltic differed, probably refers only to dialectical difterences.^ If a close

ethnical relationship can be estaljlished between the Celti and the Belgoe, British

ethnology clearly gains in simplification. To what extent the Belgic settlers in

this country resembled the neighbouring British tribes must remain a moot point.

According to Strabo,'' the Britons were taller than the Celti, with hair less yellow,

and they were slighter in build. By the French school of ethnologists the Belgoe

are identified with the Cymr}-, aud are described as a tall fair people, similar to the

Cimbri already mentioned aud Dr. Prichard,the founder of English anthropology,
                                                                                                                                                ;

was led long ago to describe the Keltic type in similar terms.^

Yet, as we pass across Britain westwards, and advance towards those parts

which are reputed to be predominantly Keltic, the proportion of tall fair folk,

speaking in general terms, diminishes, while the short aud dark element in the

population increases, until it probably attains its maximum somewhere in this

district. As popular impressions are apt to lead us astray, let us turn for accui'acy

to the valuable mass of statistics collected in Dr. Beddoe's well-known paper ' On

the Stature and Bulk of Man in the British Isles,' ' a paper to which every student

refers with unfailing confidence, aud which will probably remain our standard

authority until the labours of our own Anthropometric Committee are sufficiently

matured for publication. Dr. Beddoe, summing up his observations on the physical

characters of the Welsh as a whole, defines them as of ' short stature, with good

weight, and a tendencj^ to darkness of eyes, hair, and skin.' With regard to this

tendency to darkness, it is well to look more searchingly at the district in which

we are assembled. Dr. Beddoe, iu another paper," indicated the tendency by a

numerical expression which he termed the inde.v of mr/rcscence. *Iu the coast-

districts and low-lands of Monmoutlishire and Glamorgan, the ancient seats of
Saxon, Norman, and Flemish colonisation, I find,' says this observer, 'the indices
of hair and eyes so low as 33-5 and 03 ; while in the interior, excluding the children
of English and Irish immigrants, the figures rise to 57-3 and 109'5---this last ratio
indicating a prevalence of dark eyes surpassing what I have met with in any other

part of Britain' (p. 43).

    Many years ago, Mr. Matthew Moggridge, whose scientific work is well known

in this district, furnished the authors of the ' Crania Britannica ' with notes of the

physical characteristics of the Welsh of Glamorganshire. He defined the people

as "having ' eyes (long) bright, of dark or hazel colour, hair generally black, or
a very dark brown, lank, generally late in turning grey.' ^

     There can be no question, then, as to the prevalence of melanism in this district.
Nor does it seem possible to account for this tendency, as some anthropologists have

suggested, by the influence of the surrounding media. Even those who believe

most firmly in the potency of the environment will hardly be inclined to accept the
opinion seriously entertained some years ago by the Rev. T. Price, that the black
eyes of Glamorganshire are due to the prevalence of coal fires." Long before coal
came into use there was the same tendency to nigrescence among the Welsh. This

may be seen, as Dr. Nicholas has pointed out, in the bardic names preserved in

ancient Welsh records, where the cognomen of da, or ' black,' very frequently occurs.
Thus, in the ' Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales,' between a.d. 1280 and 1330, there
are registered four ' blacks ' to one ' red ' and one ' grey '--namely, Gwilym Ddu,

Llywelyn Ddu, Goronwy Ddu, and Dafydd Ddu.^
   ' The' origin of this dark element in the Welsh is to be explained, as everyone

will have anticipated, by reference to the famous passage in Tacitus, which has been

worn threadbare by ethnologists. Tacitus tells us that the ancient British tribe

--of Silures a tribe'iuhabiting what is now Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire, Here-
--fordshire, and parts at least of Brecknockshire ar.d Radnor had a swarthy cora-

plexion, mostly with curly hair, and that from their situation opposite to Spain

there was reason to believe that the Iberians has passed over the sea and gained

possession of the country.'' It will be observed that although Tacitus speaks of

their dark complexion, he does not definitely state that the hair was dark ; but
this omission has, curiously enough, been supplied by Jornandes, a Goth who, in the

sixth century, wrote a work which professes to be an extract from the lost history

of Cassiodorus, wherein the very words of Tacitus are reproduced with the neces-

sary addition.' With these passages before us, can we reasonably doubt that the

swart blood in the Welsh of the present day is a direct legacy from their Silurian

ancestors ?

     Setting what Tacitus here says about the Silures against what he says in the next
sentence about the Britons nearest to Gaul (p. 5), it is clear that we must recognise
a duality of type in the population of Southern Britain in his day. This fact has
been clearly pointed out by Professor Huxley as one of the few ' fi.xed points in

British ethnology.' * At the dawn of history in this country, eighteen centuries ago,

the population was not homogeneous, but contained representatives both of Professor
Huxley's Melanochroi and of his Xanthochroi, If we have any regard whatever

differed from, the other inland tribes. Of the Caledonians and of the Belgse we

know something, but of tlie other inhabitants we are quite ignorant.

for the persistence of anthropological types, we should hesitate to refer Loth of

Wethese to one and the same elementary stock.       are led, then, to ask, Which of

these two types, if either, is to be regarded as Keltic ?
    It is because both of these types, in turn, have been called Keltic that so much

confusion has been imported into ethnolog'ical nomenclature hence the common-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

sense conclusion seems to be that neither type can strictly be termed Keltic, and

that such a term had better be used only in linguistic anthropology.* The Kelt is

merely a person who speaks a Keltic language, quite regardless of his race, though

it necessarily follows that all persons who speak similar languages, if not actually of

one blood, must have been, at some period of their history, in close social contact.

In this sense, all the inhabitants of Britain, at the period of the Roman invasion,

notwithstanding the distinction between Xanthochroi and Melanochroi, were pro-

bably to be styled Kelts. There can be little doubt that the xanthous Britons

always spoke a Keltic tongue ; but it is not so easy to decide what was the original

speech of their melanochroic neighbours.

The existence of two types of population, dark and fair, side by side, is a phe-

nomenon which was repeated in ancient Gaul. As the Silures were to Britain so

--were the Aquitani to Gaul they were the dark Iberian element. Strabo states

that while the natives of Keltic and Belgic Gaul resembled each other, the Aqui-

tanians differed in their physical characters from both of these peoples, and

resembled the Iberians. But Tacitus has left on record the opinion that the

Silures also resembled the Iberians ; hence the conclusion that the Silures and the

NowAquitauians were more or less alike.   it is generally believed that the relics of

the old Aquitaniau population are still to be found lingering in the neighbourhood

Aof the Pyrenees, being represented at the present day by the Basques.               popular

notion has thus got abroad that the ancient Silures must have been remotely affined

to the Basque populations of France and Spain. Nevertheless, the modern

Basques are so mixed a race that, although retaining their ancient language, their

physical characters have been so modified that we cau hardly expect to find in

them the features of the old Silurians. Thus, according to the Tlev. Wentworth

Webster, the average colour of the Basque hair at the present day is not darker

than chestnut.

Neither does language render us any aid towards solving the Basque problem.

If the Silures were in this country prior to the advent of the Gymrj-, and if they

were cognate with the Basques, it seems only reasonable to suppose that some

spoor of their Iberian speecli, however scant, might still be lingering amongst us.

Yet philologists have sought in vain for the traces of any Euskarian element in

the Oymraeg. Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, perhaps tlie only philologist in this

country who has a right to speak with authority on such a subject, has obligingly

informed me that he knows of no connexion whatever between the two languages.

Still it must be remembered that the Iberian affinity of the Silures, suggested by

the remark of Tacitus, does not necessarily mean Basque affinity. Some philo-

logists have even denied that the Basques are Iberians.'' All that we seek at

--present to establish is this that the dark Britons, represented by the tribe of

Silures, although they came to be a Keltic-speaking people, were distinct in race

from the fair Britons, and therefore in all lilieliliood were originally distinct in

speech. Nor should it be forgotten that relics of a pre-Keltic non-Aryan people

have been detected in a few place-names in Wales. Thus, Professor Rhj's is

inclined to refer to this category such names as Menapia, Mona, and Mynwy *

the last-named being a place (Monmouth) withiu the territory of the old Silures,

where we are now assembled. \^'e may also look for light upon this subject from a

paper wbicli will be laid before the Department by Mr. Hvde Clarke. On the whole
it seems to me safer to follow Professor Rollestou in sf eaking of the dark pre-Keltic

element as Silurian rather than as Basque or as Iberian.' (' British Barrows,' p. G30.')

     There is, however, quite another quarter to which the anthropologist who is
engaged in this investigation may turn with fair promise of reward. I need

scarcely remind anyone in this department of the singularly suggestive paper which

was written more than fifteen years ago by the late Dr. Thurnam, ' On the Two

Principal Forms of Ancient British and Gaulish Skulls.' ^ The long-continued

--researches of this eminent archaeological anatomist led him to the conclusion that

the oldest sepulchres of this country the chambered and other long barrows which
he explored in ^N'ilts and Gloucestershire--invariably contained the remains of a

dolichocephalic people, who were of short stature, and apparently were un-
acquainted with the use of metals. The absence of metal would alone raise a

suspicion that these elongated tumuli were older than the round, couoidal, or bell-
shaped barrows, which contain objects of bronze, if not of iron, with or without
weapons of stone, and commonlj' associated with the remains of a taller brachy-

cephalic people.

     Even before Dr. Thurnam forcibly pointed attention to this distinction, it
had been independently observed by so experienced a barrow-opener as the late
Mr. Bateman,^ whose researches were conducted in quite another part of the
country-- the district of the ancient Cornavii. Moreover, Professor Daniel Wilson's
studies in Scotland had led him to conclude that the earliest population of Britain
were dolichocephalic, and possessed, in fact, a form of skull which, from its boat-
like shape, he termed kmnbecephalic* Nor should it be forgotten that as far back

as 1844 the late Sir W. E. Wilde expressed his belief that in Ireland the most

ancient type of skull is a long skull, which he held to belong to a dark-com-

plexioned people, probably aboriginal, who were succeeded by a fair, roimd-headed

race.*

     But while this succession of races was recognised by several observers, it re-
mained for Dr. Thurnam to formulate the relation between the shape of the skuU

--and that of the barrow in a neat aphorism which has become a standing dictum in

anthropolog}- ' Long barrows, long skulls : round barrows, round skulls ; dolieho-

taphic barrows, dolichocephalic crania; brachytaphic barrows, brachycephalic

crania.' No doubt exceptional cases may occur in which roimd skulls have been

found in long barrows, but these have generally been explained as being due to

secondary interments. On the other hand, the occasional presence of long skulls

in round barrows presents no difficulty, since no one supposes that the early doli-
cbocephali were exterminated by the "brachycephali, and it is therefore probable

that during the bronze-using period, when round tumuli were in general use, the
two peoples may have dwelt side by side, the older race being, perhap.s, in a state

of subjugation.
     It 'is not pretended that Thurnam's apophthegm has more than a local appli-

cation. ' This axiom,' its author admitted, ' is evidently not applicable unless
with considerable limitations, to France.' Although it is here called an ' axiom,'

it is by no means a self-evident proposition, the relation between the shape of the
skull and the shape of the burial-mound being purely arbitrary. The proposition
which connects the two is simply the expression of the results of accumulated
observations, and it is of course open to doubt whether the number of observations
was sufficiently great to warrant the generalisation. But the only test of the
validity of any induction lies in its verification when applied to fresh instances,

     ' W. von Humboldt in his famous essay, ' Priifung der Untersuchungen iiber die
Urbewohner Hispaniens vermittelst der Vaskischen .Sprache,' does not admit, on
philological evidence, any extension of the Iberians to this countrj'. See c. 44 : ' Uebcr

and it is remarkable that when long barrows and chambered tumuli have since

been opened in this country the evidence has tended in the main to confirm Dr.
Thurnam's proposition.

It is commonly believed that the brachycephali of the round barrows came in

contact with the dolichocephali as an invading, and ultimately as a conquering,

--race. Not only were they armed with superior weapons superior in so far as a
--metal axe is a better weapon than a stone axe but they were a taller and more

powerful people. Thurnam's measurements of femora led to the conclusion that

the average height of the brachycephali was 5 feet 84 inches, while that of the
long-headed men was only 5 feet 5-4 inches.^ Not only were they taller, but they

were probably a fiercer and more warlike race. In the skulls from the round

barrows the superciliary ridges are more prominent, the nasals diverge at a more

abrupt angle, tlie cheek-bones are high, and the lower jaw projects, giving the face

an aspect of ferocitj-, which contrasts unfavourably with the mild features of the

earlier stone-using people.

On the whole, then, the researches of archseological anatomists tend to prove

that this country was tenanted in ante-historic or pre-Roman times by two peoples

who were ethnically distinct from each other. It is difficult to resist the tempta-

tion of applying this to the ethnogeny of Wales. Does it not seem probable that

the early short race of long-skulled, mild-featured, stone-using people may have

been the ancestors of the swarthy Silurians of Tacitus ; while the later tall race

of round-skulled, rugged-featured, bronze-using men may have represented the

broad-headed, Keltic-speaking folk of history ? At any rate, the evidence of

craniology does not run counter to this hj^Dothesis. For Dr. Beddoe's observa-

tions on head-forms in the West of England have shown that ' heads which are

ordinarily called brachycephalic belonged for the most part to individuals with

light hair,' while the short dark-haired people whom he examined were markedly

dolichocephalic.^ At the same time it must be admitted that his observations lend

'no support to the view that the Keltic sljiill has been or would be narrowed by an

admixture of the Iberian type.' It should not, however, be forgotten that the

same observer, in referring to a collection of crania from the Basque country pre-

served in Paris, says ' the form of M. Broca's Basque crania was very much that of

some modern Silurian heads.'

According to the view advocated by Thurnani we have a right to anticipate

that the oldest skulls found in this country would be of dolichocephalous type

and such I believe to be actually the case. Dr. Barnard Davis, it is true, has

stated in the Crania Britannica that the ancient British skull must be referred to

the brachycephalic type                                                                                             and such an  induction was perfectly legitimate so long as
                                                                                                                 ;

the craniologist dealt only with skulls from the round barrows or from similar

interments. But the long-barrow skulls examined hy Professor RoUeston,* and

the Cissbury skulls recently studied by the same anatomist,^ are decidedly doli-

chocephalic, as also are all the early prehistoric skulls which have been found of

late years in France. While referring to craniology in this country, I may perhaps

be allowed to remark that the eminent Italian anthropologist. Dr. Paolo Mante-

gazza, in a suggestive paper which has just appeared in his A-aluable journal, the

--ArcMvio per VAntropologia, has referred to the Englishman's contempt for cranio-

logical work work but little worthy of the practical spirit of the Anglo-Saxon
race.^ No doubt it is desirable to increase the number of our observations, but still

the good-humoured remark about despising crauiology can hardly he applied to a

country which numbers among its living men of science such eminent craniologists

as Professor Busk, Professor Cleland, Dr. Barnard Davis, and Professors Flower,

Huxley, and Rolleston.

    It may naturally he asked whether the researches of archreologists in Wales

lend any support to Thurnam's hypothesis. Nothing, I conceive, would be easier

than to show that very material support has come from this quarter ; but I have

abstained, of set purpose, from introducing into this address any remarks on the

prehistoric archaeology of Wales. For I have not forgotten that we are to have

the privilege of hearing an evening lecture on ' Primeval ]\Iau ' by so distinguished

an archaeologist and naturalist as Professor Boyd Dawkins. No one has done

more in this country to forward Thurnam's views, whether by actual exploration

or  by  writing,  than  Professor                                                                                                      Dawkins                                        and  if  I  have not referred    to his work,
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

especially to his discoveries in Denbighshire, it has been simply because I was

anxious to avoid trespassing on any subject which he is likely to bring forward.'

    Setting aside, then, any archaeological evidence derived from the bone-caves,

barrows, or other sepulchres in Wales, we may finally look at the outcome of our

inquiry into Welsh ethnogeny. If we admit, as it seems to me we are bound to

admit, the existence of two distinct ethnical elements in the Welsh population,

--one of which is short, dark, and dolichocephalic call it Silurian, Atlautean, Iberian,

Basque, or what you will ; and the other of which is tall, fair, and brachycephalic,

such as some term Cymric, and others Ligurian ; -then it follows that by the cross-

ing of these two races we may obtain not only individuals of intermediate character,

but occasionally more complex combinations ; for example, an individual may have

the short stature and long head of the one race, associated with the lighter hair of

the other ; or again, the tall stature of one may be found in association with the

melanism and dolichocephalism of the other race. It is, therefore, no objection to

the views herein expressed if we can point to a living Welshman who happens to be
at once tall and dark, or to another who is short and fair.

    At the same time, I am by no means disposed to admit that when we have

recognised the union of the xanthous and melanic elements in Wales, with a pre-

dominance of the latter in the south, we have approached to anything like the

exhausting limit of the subject. Still earlier races may have dwelt in the land, and

have contributed something to the composition of the Welsh. In fact, the anthro-

pologist may say of a Welshman, as a character in ' Cymbeline ' says of Posthu-

mus when doubtful about his pedigree,

                                     ' I cannot delve him to the root.'

It is possible that the roots of the Welsh may reach far down into some hidden
primitive stock, older mayhap than the Neolithic ancestors of the Silurians ; but of
such pristine people we have no direct evidence. So far, however, as positive
investigation has gone, we may safely conclude that the Welsh are the representa-

tives, in large proportion, of a very ancient race or races ; and that they are a com-

posite people who may perhaps be best defined as Siluro-Cymric.
    Many other questions relating to Welsh ethnology press for consideration

such as the hypothesis that the Kymro was preceded, in parts at least of Wales,

by the Gael ; but such questions must be dismissed from present discussion, for

I fear that my remarks have already overrim the limits of a departmental
address. Let us hope, however, that much light may be thrown upon a variety of

questions bearing upon local anthropology in the course of the discussions which
will arise in this department during the present session of the Association.

The following Papers were read :

1. Notes on the Origin of the Malagasy. By C. Staniland Wake.

After referring to the traces of early Arab influence in Madagascar, the paper

proceeded to show the close agreement in manners and customs between the Mala-

gasy and the Siamese and other peoples of the Indo-Ohmese peninsula. The

Malagasy were then shown not to have any special connection, in either customs or

physical characters, with the islanders of the Pacific, their agreement in certain par-

ticulars being due to their common origin in South-eastern Asia, a conclusion

which is confirmed by the evidence of language. The author considered that the

peculiarities presented by the Plovas and allied tribes, as distinguished from the other

Malagasy, were due to the Arab element which was introduced into South-eastern

Madagascar, perhaps indirectly, from the Indian Archipelago, about the eighth

century, a.d. Traces of Hindu influence are also perceptible among the Malagasy,

owhig to intercourse with the Hindus before the migration from the Indian

Archipelago. Whether these Asiatic settlers found an earlier race inhabiting

Madagascar is doubtful                                                                                                             but some of the     Malagasy tribes possess many features in

                                            2. On the Antiquities of Loughor Castle} By B. Jones.

    An ancient British camp or station, called ' Llwchdwr,' utilised by the Romans,

and called ' Luecarum.' It had an outer and inner moat, and a watercourse from

the river Llw, about five miles distant, to feed the moats, and the garrison was

called ' Poundagwrdrwg-.'

The remams of the ancient castle are situated on the eastern bank of the delta

of the river Llwchdwr, a muddy stream commanding views of the valley and
-- Ancountry all around quite a ' bella vista.'
                                                                                                                                                       outpost called ' Stoutwall ' existed,

and a sudatorium, west of the church, taken away by the South Wales Railway.

Roman tiles have been found in the sudatorium with a dog's footprint, also some

Apottery and Roman coins, some in possession of the writer.                                                                                                          foot-bridge crossed

the river to the hospitium of the garrison, now called spitty.

 The Via Julia came direct                                                                                                         from         Nedum, or Neath, to  Luecarum.  Traces of it

_

existed until recently, passing Pen-lle-gaer as an intermediate camp, from which

the Via Julia diverged northward to a bridge over the Loughor river at Llandilo-

taly-bont, leading to a Roman camp at Estemenlle, on its way to the Roman

' Maridunum,' or Carmarthen. The ancient town of Loughor was situated south of

the castle                                  traces of it                                                                           still to be  seen.  The present town is built chiefly on the

inner moat. There exists still a building called the ' sanctuary,' supposed to be

the Roman garrison chapel ; and Pentwyn Hill, inside the outer moat, was prob-

ably the garrison exercise-ground.

The Roman coins comprise some of Trajan, Nerva, and Antoninus, and several

--others in Mr. Jones's collection (some found at Loughor), also other more modern

coins some Saxon found in tlie ruins of the old Manor House in Temple Street,

Swansea, and also coins fomid in a foundation of Christ's Hospital in London.

Mr. Jones has also a DruicVs head, found in a cairn on Cefenbryn Common in

Gower. Mr. Jones mentions various other coins in his collection.

munications of Mr. Gardiner, II.M. Service, West Coast of Africa. Mr. Clarke did

--not consider the signals to be as by dot and dash (· ), but as due to the notes re-

presenting a consonant and vowel, and suited to the syllables of the native languages.

If a note conventionally represented a consonant, then the people -would so imder-

stand it, and make tlie syllable, the consonant being accompanied by its well-known

vowel ; there would rarely be three notes. He considered the term drnm-speaking

might be used, for tlie people so understood the several drums, Avliether employed
for signalling, fetish-drums, or for reciting praises of chiefs. The drummer was
employed by the mail steamers to commmiicate with the shore, and messages could
be sent two miles, and answers returned, and by relays they could be transmitted

twenty miles. He referred to the drum as a very ancient institution, and as giving

name to Cybele and drum-shaped moimtains, and hence to its adoption in ancient
and modern mythology.

      5. On a Manuscript, perliaps Khita, discovered hy Captain Gill in
                          Western China. By Hype Clarke.

    This manuscript was found by Captain W. Gill, R.E., in his late travels, at

Kudeu, near Li-Kiang. Mr. Clarke had examined and found that the characters

are allied to Khita (Hittite), Vei of W. Africa, Babylonian, Egyptian, and the ancient

Shwo-w6n of China, as well as to the Cypriote and Iberian alphabets, and notably the

Runes. He had identified a considerable number of characters. He considered this

as an outlying branch of the Khita class, and as atti'ibutable to the allied empire
which gave the name of Kitai (Cathay) to the region. The whole was a testimony

to the common distribution of ancient civilisation from one source throughout the
world. The numerals were arranged partly like the Egyptian and partly like the
Phceniciau. -I- (or -^ ) was repeatedly accompanied by a star », and by the number

seven in Egyptian order, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, (4 and 3), like a group of seven pyramids in
Eg\'pt or Mexico. The mvthological reference he considered to be the god Saba.

4wasIIII,5 III II,6'III III, 8 IIII IIII,9 III III III. The MS.
is possibly a copy of sculptured inscriptions. There may perhaps be cartouches in

it. Besides characters, there are, as in Khita, animals and animals' heads in pairs

(totems), and, besides, the fish.

     6. Recent Doidits on Monosi/llabism in Philological Classification.

                                   By Hyde Claeke.

Mr. Hyde Clarke pointed out that his determination, supported by Dr. Carl

Abel, &c., now showed that the Chinese, and Indo-Chinese, and Egyptian, and

Coptic, are not in their origin monosyllabic, but contain dissyllabic roots of

which the final vowel is elided. This rendered the term monosyllabic inapplicable

for a class of languages, or for an epoch in their history. The formation of words

in the Semitic languages was a simple handing down from the prehistoric period,

an application of difterentiation and of aflixes, in comparison -with which inflection

is a minor characteristic. The doctrine of an Aryan primitive language and civilisa-

--tion is a simple imagination, the Aryan languages being like the others developed

from the prehistoric epoch. No such thing as a single typical primeval language

had  ever  existed                                    but, on  the  contrary, fifty primeval languages or more founded
                                                   ;

on the same svstem, but with various words.

                             FEIDAY, AUGUST 27.

The following Papers were read :

1. On the Stone Age in South Africa. By W. D. GOOCH, C.E.

     The author discussed the suhject from the following aspects :
     1. Types of Implements.

     2. Distribution of Implements.
     3. Character of Deposits in which they occur.
     4. Character of material from which they are fashioned.

     The ethnological facts suggested were
     First, the presence of a primeval low stage of existence, correlating the usual

earliest evidences of man upon earth, as found in other countries.

     Its indications are found iu the quaternary strata of Natal, and prohably, on
more complete examinations of South Africa, will be imiversally seen in deposits

of similar age.

     There seems reason to beheve that the earliest beds in which anthropological

traces occur are 'glacial.'

The materials used in the earlier strata are Grit and sandstone of a metamor-

phic character, with doubtful  examples of indurated  shale                        these being gradually
                                                                                ;

replaced in the latter strata by harder Trachyte, metamorphic rocks, and even

Chalcedony. The working of the materials is rude, displaying a vei-y limited power

of fashioning either a constant shape or type, striving rather after a keen edge or

point, as the ' simimum bonum ' to be acliieved.

Rough clubs or celts of sandstone, with rude and irregular-shaped assegai

weapons for thrusting or throwing, appear to have been the methods of offence at

command.

     For sewing skins together, thorns of plants and sinews of animals were ready
to hand.

     Pottery, which seems doubtfully present, is unburnt and unornamented.
     This represents a 'Palaeolithic Era' in South Africa.

     Second. To the proceeding by intra-development, or grafted on it by a wave
of development from the North, succeeded a period which is represented by the

contents of the upland strata of Natal and the eastern province of the ' Old Colony.'
This indicates a state in which the use of the hoio was well known, and the
javelin forms of the Celts were well-developed and formed by ^ chipping ^ of a

coarse character.

The coarse and less effective materials, sandstone and grit, had been discarded,

and the harder sorts of quartz, trachyte, metamorphic and chalcedonic rocks were

used to provide flakes. These Flakes were keen, symmetrically fashioned, and of

a general uniformity in shape and character, but untrimmed. Pottery had become

well known, but its ornamentation and good burning had not yet been arrived at.

Most of the alluvial deposits of the uplands and the ^olian of the coasts yield

relics of this period.

Third. Almost allied to the last-named, and found insensibly rising from it,

especially in the ^olian strata of the coast-lands of Natal, is a period in which

polished stone, and ornamented pottery, with wrought weapons in chalcedony of a

' trimmed ' character, are found associated with rougher implements in siliceous

and other rocks. The arrow-heads are of a shape which suggests not only know-

Warledge and use of the bow, but oi poison.  clubs, consisting of perforated stones

well-wrought and polished, belong to this age, and form a connecting link between

this period, locally developed iu Natal, and the next one.

   mThe fourth period has a similar aspect to the third, except its pottery. The

materials used are of a highly siliceous character ; the forms of all the weapons,
whether picks, scrapers, or arrow-heads, are usually improved by chipping and

trimming the original flake at the edges. The variety of types of form is very
much increased, and many uses not clearly suggested by the weapons themselves
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  623

are now indicated. The arrow-head prevails, and assegai-heads of a light character,

adapted for throwing, such as the 'Pondas,' 'Gaikas,' and 'Galekas' of to-day
employ, preponderate. The small arrow-heads of chalcedony are very broad and
often minute, and evidently were adapted to the use of poison to supplement their

eifect.

     War-cluhs are abundant, but no other form of polished weapon is found.
Mullers and mortars for preparing roots, gi'ain, and paints are seen, and the char-
acter of the life led seems to be identical with that now followed by the Korannas
and other tribes allied to the Bosjesmen, inhabiting those districts in which relics of

this age abound.

     The Pottery of this development is coarse in shape, design, and manufacture, and
very devoid of ornament. It is traceable from the highlands, Overberg, at the
Diamond Fields southward till the Cape of Good Hope is reached ; through the
Overberg, Berg, and Cape districts, but is not found where the third period is

developed.

     The Jifth and last period only differs from the preceding one in the perfection
of the workmanship of the implements found in the Cape deposits. It presents the
same aspect in pottery and types of weapons. The essentially local occiu-rence of
this period only on the Cape Flats, points to a sudden improvement in the know-
ledge of worldng in stone, which seems only to be explained by the supposition
of an ingraft of a race, which landing at Table or False Bays, there located their
personal acquaintance with stone-fashioning, acquired among their own people ·

in another clime.

2. Oil an Ancient Settlement found about 21 feet beneath the surface of the

     l^eat, in the coal-bog near Boho, county Fermanagh. By Thomas

       Plunkett, M.U.I.A.

     This interesting discovery consists of the remains of two log-huts found in
a primitive crannoge 21 feet beneath the peat. The depression now filled with
peat was a lake-basin at the period the island and log-huts were constructed.
Shell-marl was found a few feet below the crannoge, also in various places in the
bog where the peat had been cut to any great depth. The crannoge measured
10 by 14 yards, The more complete hut was 6i feet wide and about 7^ long,

inside measurement.

    Its framework consisted of four massive posts of oak at the corners. An oak

beam or thick bar passed through each pair of posts. Oak plank, about seven
feet long, rested at each end on the beams and formed the floor of the hut. The
sides of the structure were supported by large logs of oak pUed on each other
horizontally. Fragments of oak plank were found partly burnt; it is supposed
the roof was destroyed by fire.

     Flint implements, hand-made pottery, and other objects were found in con-
nection with the huts, but no metal of any kind.

   A large stump of pine was found in situ above the level of the floors of the

huts, and had in its rootlets charcoal and kitchen-midden debris. The author is of
opinion that the huts were formed before the age of bog pine, as no pine occurs
below the level of the site on which the huts stood. The fact that 21 feet of dark
compact peat had grown since the structures were formed is substantial evidence

of their great antiquity.

                  5. On Prehistoric Times in the Valley of the Rhine.

                              By Professor Schaaffhausen.

    The author described the results of his ohservations made in the Valley of the
Rhine, hetween Mayence and Cologne. The hurial-places of pre-Roman times are
always situated on the ancient banks of this river. The immense prehistoric heds of
our present rivers must he considered in close connection with the greater extension of
the ice-hills in the mountains, which are the principal sources of the great rivers.
It has lately been observed in the neighbourhood of Berlin, which is situated in the

ancient bed of the Spree, that all remains of the stone and bronze periods are found
in the higher land, whilst those of the irou period are found at a lower level.

    Professor Schaaffhausen believed that Neanderthal man was living during the
glacial period. There are found in Switzerland stakes, pointed by a human hand,

in a formation, which is placed between two glacial periods. Near Ooblenz, in the

valley of the Moselle, was found, deep in the diluvial clay of the river, the skull of
bos moschatus, a mammal, which lives now only in the coldest northern regions ; the
outside of this skull bears irrefutable marks of human stone implements ; it is evident,
therefore, that man was living during the glacial period of the Rhenish country.'

    Professor Schaaffhausen also adduced evidence in proof of the existence of man
at the time when the craters and large lava-streams near the Rhine were formed.

   6. On the Original Neanderthal Skull. By Professor Schaaffhausen.

     Professor Schaaffhausen expressed his conviction that this skull (which he ex-
hibited) is not that of an idiot, nor is its peculiarity the result of disease, but it is

a typical form, which represents the lowest degree of development of the human

skvill hitherto observed.

 7. On a Palceolithic Stone Implement from Egypt. By H. Stopes, F.G.S.

     The author drew attention to the exceptional position and physical conditions
of Egypt, making it probable that the greater number of the prehistoric imple-
ments of that country were covered with Nile mud, and consequently difficult to hud.
These he deemed sufficient reasons to account for the negative evidence of many
authors not having at present been refuted by the discovery of palaeolithic imple-
ments. Details were then given of the finding of a remarkably fine palseolith of
the true river-drift type, at a distance of half a mile from the Spring of Moses, near

Cairo, in latitude 30° 1', longitude 31° 20'. It is of red porphoritic conglomerate,

precisely similar to that found at Gebel Achmar, a few miles distant, and upon this
fact the author laid considerable stress, as direct evidence that it was made and
used in the neighbourhood in which it was picked up. The implement bears traces
of considerable wear by blown sand. Its greatest length is 5-5 inches, width 3-8
inches, and thickness 1-5. It has the regvdar shape of river-drift palteoliths, although
it is thinner and has a finer cutting point than those made of flint ; the cutting edge
is chipped and worn by use. It was lying exposed upon the surface, with its best
side upwards, and seemed to be in an old dried-up river-bed. It resembles South
African pah-eoliths in having two pieces knocked Irom its upper edge. The author
then commented upon the value of the discovery in disproving the objections of
Marriette, Brugsch, and others as to the existence of the Stone Age in Egypt.

8. On a Palceolithic Flint Implement from Palestine. By H. Stopes, F.G.S.

     The author described a flint implement of the river-drift type, found by him
February 13, 1880, about two and a half miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Beth-
lehem. It was by the (so-called) road, lying with many thousands of rough flints

of the common flint of Judaea. Its length is 4-4 inches, width 3"5 inches, and greatest
thickness 1*4 inches. Either when being made or during use, it has lost a large
splinter from its bottom edge, nearly to the centre, and has apparently been much
used, as its cutting edge is much chipped and worn, and it has recently been chipped
a number of times by being struck with the hoofs of passing horses and other

animals.

           SATURDAY, AUGUST 28.

         The Department did not meet.

                          MONDAY, AUGUST 30.

The following Report and Papers were read :

 --1. Report of the Anthropometric Committee. See Reports, p. 120.

         2. On a PocJcet Registrator for Anthropological Purposes.
                       By Francis Galton, M.A., F.R.S.

The author exhibited a small instrument ^ inch thick, 4 inches long and If

wide, furnished with five stops, each communicating by a ratchet with a separate

index arm that moves round its own dial-plate. The registrator may be grasped

and held unseen in either hand with a separate finger over each stop. When any

finger is pressed on the stop below it, the corresponding index arm moves forward

one step. Guides are placed between the stops to ensure the fingers occupying

their proper positions when the instrument is seized and used in the pocket, or

when it is slipped inside a loose glove or other cover. It is possible by its means

to take anthropological statistics of any kind among crowds of people without

exciting observation, which it is otherwise exceedingly difficult to do. The
statistics may be grouped under any number of headings not exceeding five. If it

should ever be thought worth while to use a registrator in each hand, ten headings

could be employed. The instrument that was exhibited worked well, but it was

the first of its kind and might be improved. It was made by Mr. Hawkesley,

surgical instrument maker, 300 Oxford Street, London. The author also drew

attention to the ease with which registers may be kept by prickiDg holes in paper

Ain diflerent compartments with a fine needle.  great many holes may be

pricked at haphazard close together, without their running into one another or

otherwise making it difficult to count them afterwards. The mark is indelible,

and any scrap of paper suffices. The needle ought to project a very short way

out of its wooden holder, just enough to perforate the paper, but not more. It

can then be freely used without pricking the fingers. This method, however,

requires two hands, and its use excites nearly as much observation as that of a

pencil.

3. Additional Remarks on the Greek Profile (incorrectly so called).

                        By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

It was stated in a previous communication that the continuity of the forehead

and nasal-bone in a straight line, which is so marked a peculiarity in early Greek

statues and coins, is not found to exist either in ancient Greek skulls in our museums,

1880.    SS
                                                                                                ;

--626 BEPORT 1880.

or in the eifigies of kings and heroes after the date of Alexander the Great, when

numismatists inform us that the natural features came to be represented in Greece.

It was added, however, in the paper alluded to, that the feature in question was

not to be considered, on this account, as merely ideal. Skulls from Palmyra and

ancient Thebes show that people existed who partially possessed the peculiarity

and numerous sepulchral monuments, and terra cottas from Tyre and Aradus in

the galleries of the Louvre as well as one from Sidon in the British Museum, which

it can scarcely be doubted were intended to be likenesses, appear to point to the

race subsequently called Phoenician as the one possessing the feature in question.

     This identification has been since carried a step further. The effigies on the
Carthaginian coins show unmistakably, in the African character of the lips, the mix-

ture  of  blood  in  the  Punico-Phoenician  or  Carthaginian  race                        and  undoubtedly
                                                                                        ;

helps to prove that the straight line of forehead and nose, also observed in these

coins, had its deiivation from Tyre. The same prominent lips are also met with

on some of the coins of SicUy ; and the peculiarity exists amongst the Moors at the

present day, who are believed to be a race composed of Carthaginians and Berbers,

whose profile, in like manner, shows the same straight line as the Phoenicians.

In Egypt, an examination of the frescoes from its early tombs, so carefully copied

in Rosellini's great work, shows that amongst the more cultivated ranks, especially

the officials, the feature is continually met with. And Egyptologists inform us
that the people who occupied the Delta, long before Phoenicians were known by
that name, were much employed by the native dynasties, and it is probable navi-

gated their sea-going ships, the native Egyptians having, it is well known, a dread

of the sea themselves.

Certainly the feature in question is found to have been portrayed in Egypt long

before it was represented in sculpture and in terra-cotta statuettes in Greece, and

is even seen in the fresco of one of the gods of Egypt, copied byRosellini (pi. Ixvii).

    Doubt has been felt whether any human cranium ever existed without a hollow

or indent beneath the brow-ridge ; but it is sufficient if an abnormal slope in the

forehead co-exists with a straight nose ; the muscles that stretch from the brow-
ridge to the nasal arch would then complete the feature.

Exceptionally straight profiles, it should be mentioned, have been noticed in

Attica, the coasts of Asia Minor, and some of the Greek islands. And there are

two crania from ancient Athens, in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons

that contrast strongly with a number from that locality, and other parts of Greece,

in the same museum. It has been assumed, as in the case of the skulls from Thebes

in Egypt, that these are Phoenician, since they have the heavy brow-ridges and

slightly receding foreheads that appear to have been characteristic of the race.

Consequently it may be that the people who have been noticed with the straight

line of profile, as still existing, are descendants of Phoenician settlers. They are

met with precisely where traces of that remarkable race might be found, and that

even at Athens, where they occupied a quarter of their own.

4. On the British Flint-workers at Brandon. By J. Pakk Harrison, M.A.

     At the last meeting of the Association Mr. Skertchly expressed a strong belief

that the Brandon Flint-works had been in continuous operation from neolithic
times to our own day ; the demand for ' strike-a-lights ' alone, in all probability,
keeping the art of flint-knapping in action, though flint implements for other pur-

poses also, agricultural and domestic, may have been in requisition long after iron

came into general use ; more especially in the neighbourhood of factories. In the

Orkneys, it is credibly reported that flint knives are still preferred to steel for paring

apples.

     As it appeared likely, if the art had been kept up in the manner supposed, that
it would have been confined to certain families, and so have tended to perpetuate
racial characteristics, a visit was made, soon after the Sheffield Meeting, to the
locality of the works at Brandon, when it was at once apparent that the flint-

knappers and their families, as well as a large portion of the general population of
                                                                                 ;

                               --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHKOPOLOQT.  627

the village, to a more or less extent, contrasted strongly in colour of hair and eyea

with the people of Norfolk and Suffolk on the borders of which two counties

Brandon is situated. Very dark hair <and eyes evidently predominated, whilst they

were almost wanting in the ranks of the militia and volunteers who were then

in training, and so could be inspected for the purpose of testing this point. Of eighty
recruits of the West Norfolk regiments, only three were entered in the reoister

as having davlc hair and eyes, and seventeen only with a depressed nasal-bone.

Photographs of a number of the Brandon inhabitants have been obtained [shown],

and several have been mistaken by persons acquainted with the Principality for

Welsh                          whilst others were  thought by French anthropologists, to whom they were
                            ;

shown, to resemble the Iberian type of the Continent.

     Though it has been supposed that the flint-works at Oissbury might also have

continued in operation long after the Roman times, a greater mixture of races would

appear to have occurred there, from causes peculiar to the locality, than in the
more remote village of Brandjon, where the march of civilisation was less rapid

consequently it is not believed that any of the original flint-workers of Oissbury

have now any representatives existmg ; though here and there one may fancy that

the type occasionally comes out through atavism. At Brandon there can scarcely
be a doubt that we still possess examples of an early British race.

5. On the Metention of Ancient and Preliistoric Customs in the Pyrenees
                          By Dr. Phen^, F.8.A., F.B.G.8.

   The author pointed out that he had the honour at the last meeting, at SheflSeld to
lay before this Section some matters which had come under his notice rather unex-
pectedly while he was making quite a different class of inquiries, to pursue which
he had visited the Pyi-enees. The particulars were crude and incomplete, but he felt
it a duty to lay before this society the matter as far as he had it under his observa-
tion, that others might have an opportunity of examining it as well as himself or
in the event of his being prevented, from any cause, investigating further, that it
might not be lost to observation.

    He said : ' I this year pursued the subject steadily, making photographs of the

greater points of interest where roads permitted conveyance of the necessary

apparatus, and I not only find my views confirmed, but also that several Frenchmen
of science have been following the same investigations, so that I am able to add
their testimony to my own.

     * These gentlemen have very kindlj^ placed the results of their investigations

before me, and have expressed interest in my own researches.

    ' The discovery of a new field of Gallic monuments, with interments and ciner-

ary urns of the oldest type, is not only interesting, but does not stand alone, as

with these are found a class of monuments hitherto entirely overlooked by anti-
quaries, and also customs retained by the population of the surroundino- districts
of a nature so peculiar that, while they probably throw a light upon some past
customs of these people not before known, they stand now in an almost unkno%vn

position.

    ' To make quite sm-e of my subject, I again approached the district throuo-h

Languedoc, where there is a complete absence of even the most usual represent^a-
tions, either in sculpture or paintmg, of the serpent or dragon. Stopping at the an-

cient cathedral of St. Bertrand-de-Comminges, the old Roman station of Luo'dunum

Convenarum, the inquirer all at once finds himself in a diflerent reo-ion and as it
were in a diflerent age.

     ' Over the principal doorway at the west side, the Madonna and Child occupv
a cbair made of dragons exactly identical with the dragon chair occupied by King
David I., of Scotland, as shown on his great seal. I produce the photograph and
great seal. AVithin the church, so very unsymbolic has some one been, that a dried

crocodile represents the veritable dragon the saint cleared out of the district.
     ' Such sj-mbolism, apparently, runs in particular districts, and which are almost

always marked by old stations of the Romans, and more lately of the Templars.

                                                                           ss 2

* These are all indicative of the serpent or dragon, from frescoes only three

--centuries old, to sculptures, mounds, or earthworks, and alignements of granite

blocks all being made to represent the serpent, counting as many thousand years.

Mons. Julien Sacaze, writing of these stones, which are in the locality where he

the belief of their ancestors they said. The most remarkable of these objects are

three moimds, in the forms of serpents, which have been appropriated, one by a

chamber of Roman construction, possibly as a security for wealth, one by a very

ancient church, and the third, unmolested, has been lately found to contain a large

deposition of Celtic iucinerary urns, the place of deposition being almost about

midway from the head to the tail. In the same position, in the mound on which

is the church, were found a large number of Gallo-Romanic votive altars and other

objects. Amongst those of this description in the neighbourhood, some altars

dedicated to mountains were found, two peaks of the Maladetta being named,

evidently showing that tlie occupation was in early Roman and Pagan times.

' On the crests and sides of the mountains, on both sides of the Pyrenees, i.e. in

Spain and France, are found sepulchral arrangements of stones, somewhat differ-

ent from any distinctly recorded amongst our antiquities. Tliese consist of a number

of circles adjoining each other ; in the centre of each is a cist with an urn, having

burnt bones, and the form of the circles is that of a wavy or serpentine cross.

' Mons. Gourdon gives a drawing of one on the Spanish aide, and I have found

several on the French side of tlie Pyrenees.

' I purchased the baker's bill, which I now produce, at Perpignan a few months

ago, and though not so rustic as that of Brittany, it approaches more to our old
Exhequer tally, and to the Welsh stick of writing, described in " Bardas," as well

as to some elaborate and really wonderful calendars, still to be seen in the Cheetham
Museum at Manchester, than to the rustic tally of Brittany. On crossing into

Spain and prosecuting inquiries, I found the serpent or dragon emblem everywhere

prominent, and even learned that the Tarasque, the ceremony of which is performed

at Tarascon in Provence, was a well-known dragon with the Spanish people. On
my explaining that I was making a study of the subject, I was told that though

used as a popular diversion at fetes, it had always a religious meaning, and that aa

old and well-known Spanish proverb ran thus

        " No hay funcion sin Tarasque."

(No religious solemnity without the dragon.)

On the eve of Saint John, the whole Pyrenees being alive with the fires handed
down from time immemorial as a custom, a vast pine, split into many vertical clefts,

is raised at Luchon, and along the route I have described in the most secluded
valleys, quite up to the Spanish frontier, as at the Valley du Lys, the pine has a
cross of flowers on its summit, and being fi.lled with combustible matter, burns in a
brilliant column of fire.

     ' But at Luchon, in particular, living serpents are consumed in the flames. The
priest, while he applies the torch, turns his face towards Spain and the Maladetta,
or mountain of bad omen. The youths of the village have miniature cloven pines
which they burn. I procured one with some little difficulty, which I produce
these they brandish while flaming, in serpentine curves, and cry loudly, " liilla-

--hilla ! " (dead) pronounced " ella." Here we have apparently a corruption of the

old classic cry of the Bacchanals, who, when lamenting the death of Bacchus,

holding serpents in their hands, rushed about wildly crying, " Eva, eva !' These
ceremonies are often prolonged into the night, and the wild cries are heard echoed
from mountain to mountain. Mons. Sacaze states that this cry is an invocation of
the Sun God. Be that as it may, it is the cry of the ancient Bacchanals, and is here
accompanied, sometimes with real serpents, sometimes with simulated serpents of

fire.

    ' The split pine was this year raised in my presence, on the back of the principal

serpent mound in the valley I have mentioned, amidst the clanging of bells during

a service on Sunday. If there had been no other satisfaction to me in this, the
evidence that this mound was artificially constructed, and not a natural formation,
as shown hy the cutting made into it, would have been great. The place where

these cries are mostly practised has most remarkable sculptures of serpents, which
I had photographed, and now produce.

     ' After the burning of the pine a rush is made by the more powerful and the
burning embers carried oif in their hands, regardless of pain. Pieces are then dis-
tributed to eA-ery household, and kept religiously during the year, as was the custom

with the Ancient Britons.'
     The author then illustrated, by diagrams, the course of the introduction of

dragon worship into Europe.

     6. On Anthropological Colour Phenomena in Belgium and elsetvhere.
                               By J. Beddoe, M.D., F.U.S.

     In Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, through governmental assistance, the
colours of the eyes and hair of all the children in the primary schools have been

observed and tabulated. The writer is very desirous that our own officials should
lend similar assistance to the Anthropometric Committee of this Associatif)n. The

results hitherto obtained have been of considerable importance, and those for
Belgium are well shown in the monograph and maps of Professor Vauderkindere.
These bring out a remarkable contrast between the Flemish and the Walloon pro-
vinces of Belgium, and tend strongly to prove the persistently hereditary character
of even such physical characters as the colour of the hair and of the iris.

    7. On the Pre-Gymrio Epoch in Wales. By Hyde Claeke, V.P.A.I.

    As existing materials for this epoch, the author eniunerated river names, place

names, record of the Silures, present ethnology, monuments, mythology, and folk-

lore. He observed, as to river names, that a fundamental error was to regard all river

names as Celtic, while as concerns the great rivers the names must belong to the
preceding epoch. Such names as Thames and Shannon are to be found in the old
and new world, and must consequently have been given by the pioneers of civilisa-
tion. Sabrina (the Severn) was illustrated by Siberis of Asia Minor, Sybaris and
Tiberis of Italy, Iberus, Abarus, Hebrus, KhalDoras. For the Tuerobis or Tivy of
Wales, and the Ravius of Sligo Bay, parallels were also given. The root of Britannia

and Sardinia, RDN, coincided with an extensive river series, Rhodanus, &c. He

recommended the collection of all Welsh and Irish place-names, and their classified
analysis. The Silures he regarded as belonging to the Iberians rather than to the
Basques. To the earlj' cultured population he assigned the Silures, the Veneti of
Britanuy, and possibly the Belgi, Verulanium, Camnlodunum, Cunobulinus, &c.,

appeared to be Turanium names. He looked for survivals of ancient populations in

Wales and Ireland, and recalled attention to the observations of Dr. Beddoe, F.R.S.,
as to obliquity of eyelid in South Wales. The discovery of Professor Rhys as to the
god Nodent, Sec. being Turanian and not Celtic, he supported. Mr. Clarke stated
that the word Druid came from the same linguistic elements, and stated that their
priesthood assimilated rather to the Egyptian, Brahmin, and Etruscan than to the

Roman priesthood. The incidents of the mythology of Britain he considered to be
of this class, and not Phoenician, which was itself of the common stock. The de-

sirability of studying the folk-lore of Wales and the other Celtic countries, under
this aspect, he pointed out, for many of the Welsh legends had been identified as
members of the general folklore of antiquity.

8. On the Antiquity of Gesture and Sign Language, and the Origin of
           Characters and Speech. By Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.I.

The author, extending the observations of Colonel Mallery, U.S.A., gave ex-

amples of the connection of signs with characters, and showed that the same psy-

chological relations in the representation of various ideas prevailed throughout, and

that there was a general connection of signs, characters, and speech. There was no

evidence of the priority of speech, but of the dependence of speech in its beginning

on sign language as an illustration. It was indeed quite possible that some existing

Asculptured symbols may belong to an epoch anterior to speech,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     sign language

could be complete and copious in itself. He described what he had seen of the

mutes of the seraglio at Constantinople, whom he considered to represent the ancient

sign language of the eastern courts, and that recorded in classic writers. With

regard to the sign language of the North American Indians, he supported Dr. E. B.

Tylor in consideruig it to be of common and ancient origin. He said it was very

desirable to have the sign language of the Porno and Ilidatsa Indians, who possibly-

represented, in language, the mound-builders.

--The following Papers were read :

1. Surgery and Superstition in Neolithic Times. By Miss A. "W. BnCKLAND.

The object of this paper was to bring before the Anthropological Department of

the British Association the frequent use of trepanning in neolithic times, as proved

by the late Dr. Broca ; to call attention to the proofs he has given of the facts, and
to his explanation of the reason of the practice, and of the superstitions associated

with it, as also its connexion with the use of cranial amulets.
     1. Dr. Broca asserts in his work on the subject that in neolithic times a surgical

operation ws5 practised which consisted in making an opening in the skull, chiefly
of infants, in order to cure certain internal maladies, and that these maladies were

epilepsy and other convulsive disorders which in early times were confounded with

epileps)-.

     2. That such individuals as survived this operation were looked upon as endowed
with peculiar properties of a mj'stic character and when tbev died rounds {ron-

delles) or fragments were frequently cut from the trepanned skull to serve as

amulets, these amulets being cut by preference from the portion of the skull close

to, and embracing, a part of the cicatrised hole caused by the trepan.

Dr. Broca proved by experiment tliat holes resembling those discovered could

be scraped in a child's skull in li\e minutes, with a flint implement, whilst the opera-
tion would take an hour on an adult skull ; he also shows conclusively that these holes

could not have been the result of accident or disease. He believes that these tre-

panned skulls prove that the people of neolithic times had attained to a belief in

spirits, and regarded epilepsy as a possession by spirits, tlie hole being cut to facili-

tate their e.xpulsion, and he goes on to show that this belief descended to our own

times                              but, at the same time, he refers the whole of  the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   trepanned  skulls  hitherto
                                ;

discovered to neolithic times, and thinks the custom died out with the introduction

of bronze, and with it of a new religion and a new mode of sepulture. This con-

clusion the author of the paper doubts, because, as shown by Dr. Broca, the practice

of trepanning for epilepsy, and b}' a very similar process to that of neolithic times,

existed in France as late as the seventeenth century ; and it was suggested that,

although the practice of cremation may have destroyed the proofs in many caseS|
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.                        631

that yet a more minute search would prohahly reveal traces of this curious custom,
not only in France, but also in Great Britain and Ireland, and, in fact, wherever the
holed stone is found as a covering to dolmens, believing that these holes are con-

--nected with the same superstition being made to facilitate the entrance and exit
--of the spirit and that the discovery of trepanned skulls in these dolmens would be

of great ethnological importance, as proving, if not a racial identity, at least some
commimication between widespread peoples in prehistoric times. Looking upon
it as an important fact that this custom of trepanning still exists, according to Dr.
Broca, among some of the South Sea Islanders, the Kabyles of Algeria, and the
mountaineers of Montenegro. Miss Buckland suggests that greater attention should

be directed to this curious subject by English antiquaries.

2. On Bushmen Crania. By Professor G. Rolleston, M.B., F.B.S.

3. On the Salting Mounds of Essex. By H. Stopes, F.G.S.

The author described the results of a series of investigations in these mounds-

They consist of a reddish burnt clay, mixed freely with broken pottery of very rude
mtype, charcoal, and wood-ashes, and clinkers. "They exist only
                                                                 one peculiar

position. Out of very many examined, none were more than five feet above ordinary

high-water mark, and none reached to low-water level. They are all uniform in

character and composition, ranging from one to five feet in thickness, and possess

the same character at top as at bottom. In size, they are very varied ; sorne

covering ten acres of ground. The number of them is unkno%vn, but eighteen stiU

exist between Strood and Virley (a space of alwut six niUes). All occur in the

marshes, but some are outside the sea-waU, and the greater nimiber within it.

Of those that are outside the existing sea-wall, two still retain the characteristic

traces of Saxon tillage. Not a single mound is known to the author which feces

the open sea. All of them fringe the creeks and estuaries, and they are invariably

placed upon the London clay.

    Many specimens of the pottery were exhibited, showing extremely coarse
manufacture, all of which were imperfect. Two fragments were of Roman make.

One flint scraper also was shown, but as it was upon the surface, the author con-

sidered it did not really belong to the mound upon which it was found.

Many local traditions were mentioned, and the opinions stated of several gentle-

men as "to their cause ; notably that of the Rev. T. 0. Atkinson, as to their being

the resultants of salt-works of Roman date.

       4. The Mountain Lajips. By Lieutenant G. T. Temple, B.N.

    The author stated that in Norway the Lapps are very generally, but incorrectly
called Finns, and therefore often confomided with the real Finns or Quaens. They
are regarded by most historians as the descendants of the aboriginal people of
Norway. The" total number of Lapps in Norway at the present time does not ex-
ceed 17,000, and of these upwards of 15,000 are sea or fisher Lapps, whose mode
of life differs but little from that of the Norwegian fishermen. In the interior of
Northern Norway, however, there are still about IGOO fjeld or mountain Lapps,
who live partly by the chase and fresh-water fishing, but chiefly on the produce of
their reindeer, the herds comprising in 1865 about 102,000 tame animals.

     For centuries they have been in contact with civilisation, but to this day their
mode of life is that of the half-wild hunter, the half-civilised nomad. Their
usages, their ornaments, and their implements all bear traces of a wild state ; and
they are, alas ! like the North American Indians, of all the allurements of civilisa-
tion, only susceptible to the temptation of spirits. It does not require very sharp

eyes to see that they are a doomed people, a people that will vanish from the earth,

and at no very distant day be classed among the things that have teen. Their

physiognomy is  decidedly Mongolian                                                                                     and their physical constitution is very
                                                                                                                     ;

peculiar, as they unite great power of enduring fatigue and privation with extreme

nervous sensibility. The Lapps of Norway are no longer heathens ; they attend
church, many can read, and all undergo some examination in the principles of reli-

gion before they are confirmed. They are fully alive to the importance of this, for

no one can be married in Norway without producing a certificate of confirmation,

and in spite of their roving habits, the Lapps are quite as much addicted to matri-
mony as we are ourselves.

The Lapps have now generally adopted the maimers and customs, as well as

the religion of their Norwegian or Russian neighbours ; but on the banks of the

Pasvig river there are some Greek-Catholic Lapps, who still go through the form

of carrying ofl' their brides from a hostile tribe.

                    5. The mttites. Bu W, St. C. Boscawen.

     In this paper Mr. Boscawen gave an account of the discoveries which had been
made by himself and others during the last year in the researches relating to the
Hittites or North Syrian tribes.

     The paper commences by pointing out the fact that the discovery and decipher-
ment of the Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions had resulted not only in restoring
to us the history and geography, the literature and civilisation of their own country,
but they had also shed great and important light on the condition of the surround-

ing nations. From the hieroglyphics and cuneiform inscriptions now accessible to

us, it was possible to restore, ynXh. a great degree of accuracy, the political and

ethnographical duration of that great and fertile middle state of Syria which

divided the leading Asiatic and African powers. The details furnished by the in-
scriptions were also largely supplemented and illustrated by the panelled walls and
ficulptured slabs with which the Assyrians and Egyptians had decorated their
palaces. The paper then proceeded to deal with the above authorities, from which
it was shown that the whole of the district of North Syria was occupied by a
powerful confederation of tribes, who were known to the Egyptians as the Kheta,
and to the Assyrians as the Khattai. These were the Khittim or Hittites of the
Hebrew writers. From the inscriptions information was deduced which showed
that, although not to be regarded as a nation, this confederation of tribes formed an
important factor in the political world of thirty years ago. Each alone was inde-
pendent in its own district and capital city, but all were one and united when the

invader threatened the land.

     The author then sketched briefly the geographical position of the various tribes,
showing their relationship to one another. The discovery of the site of the capital

of the Khittai on the banks of the Euphrates had afforded a definite point and
centre from which to commence the study of these tribes. The principal tribe of
the Khittai proper was situated round about the city of Carchemish on the Euphrates.

To the west of these were the Patanaians or the Padanaians, the tribe who occupied
the plains to the north of Aleppo watered by the Koweik. The principal cities of
these tribes were Khilbunu, the modern Aleppo, Arpad and Khazaz or Azaz.
To the west of these tribes, in the plains of El Amk, were a number of small tribes
who had come do-RTi from the slopes of the Taurus and Ammanus ranges, chief
among whom were the Katai or Katu, a highly civilised tribe who occupied the.
shores of the (iidf of Antioch, and who were related to the Kitti or Kittim of

Cyprus. South of these tribes, in the fertile valley of the Orontes and Litany rivers,

were the tribes of the Routennu or Lutennu, who were almost independent of the

Hittite league. Their chief cities were Kadesh on the Orontes, the capital and

sacred city, and Hamath and Magiddo further south.
     From an inscription of an early Babylonian king, Sargon I., King of Agane,

the author showed that the Babylonians had, in the 17th century before the Chris-
tian era, come in contact with the Khittai or Hittites. Sargon I. carried at least
                                                  --;

three campaigns into the Hittite country, one of which passed beyond the main-
laud and into the adjacent island of t'vprus. The eflect of this contact with
Babylon was shown in an interesting fragment preserved by the Hebrew writer of
the book of Genesis which related to the purchase of the cave-sepidchre of Mach-
pelah by the Hebrew patriarch. Here we find that the Babylonian commercial
system, which was known certainly to Abraham, a native of Ur, was also known
to Ephron the Hittite. Beference was next made to the hieroglyphic inscriptions
recording the campaigns of Thothmes III., against the Butennu. The composition
of the southern confederation of tribes was explained, and their relationship to the
Hittites proper explained. The defeat of the Butennu or southern branch had

opened up the way for the enlargement of the Hittite power, and the result was
that in the time of Bameses II., the Greek Sesostris, we find most of the pre-
HeUenic nations of Asia Minor who were the allies of the Hittites flockuig to aid in

repelling the invader.

      Mr. Boscawen next proceeded to describe the ruins of the Hittite city of Carche-
mish, which he visited in the early part of the present year, and where he made

drawings and copies of the sculptures and inscriptions. After describing the prin-

cipal topographical features of the site, Mr. Boscawen proceeded to describe the

sculptures discovered.

      Basing his remarks on a sculpture representing the patron goddess of Carchemish,

--the Hittite Anatha or Anat the Asiatic goddess, Mr. Boscawen proceeded to show

how the introduction of the cidt of this goddess in Asia Minor was due to the
Hittites, who were shown by the moniuuents to have possessed all the principal

characteristics of this pre-HeUenic cult as established at Ephesus.

     Mr. Boscawen next showed how that the pecidiar hierarchy of the Ephesian
Artemis, with its high priest, ' the king bee,' and its priestesses, ' the bees,' was of
Hittite origin. By means of this and the monuments, Mr, Boscawen showed the

close relationship between the Hittites and the AssjTians, Teucrians, Dardanians, and
other races of Asia Minor, and traced, by various moniunents, the route by which
the Hittites penetrated to the ^Egean Sea.

   A description was given of the other Hittite monuments from Carchemish, and

also from Boghaz, Keui, and Eyuk, in Galatia.
     The paper concluded with a description of the Hittite hieroglyphic syllabary,

and special reference was made to a bilingual text which had recently been dis-

covered.

  fi. On the Discovery of a Bi-lingnal Seal in Cuneiform and Khita. By
                                   Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.I.

     The author communicated the determination and discovery of the interpretation
and language of the Khita (Hamath, Hittite, or Carchemish)" inscriptions :

     Dr. Mordtmann found a bi-lingual seal, with the name of King Tarkondimotoa

in Cuneiform, and Professor Sayce has discovered that the other character is Khita.

On this I have sent some observations.
     Finding an impresion of the seal was in the British Museum, on Saturday, 28th

August, I saw it there in company with Dr. Birch and Mr. Pinches, and I had
already prepared a sketch which should give me, 1st, a form for king ; 2nd, for head

SihI, for children.

     The seal is most beautifully engraved, but the forms are conventional, and there-
fore only to be defined by comparison with other types.

     I found a head in character 2, and the two lines for son in character 3.
     The head is that of an animal, and the first character is that of an animal.
"What specific animals these are I cannot yet absolutely determine for want of
material. [They appear to be those of the Bull, which signifies Tura, and Lion
which signifies Kun, which are found on the gold coins of Sardis in Lydia, and
which are the gold pieces referred to in Ezra and Nehemiah as Adarkon and
Darkomonim.]
634 KKroBT-- 1880.

     The fourth character must he that for the title of king.
     The bottom character is Land, as suggested by Mr. Boscawen.
     The large side character must be Zutne or Rume.
    On leaving Dr. Birch and entering into the Museum I looked at the Carchemish
sculptures, and there I found almost a replica of the seal, and other parallels, to
which I called Dr. Birch's attention.
     This Carchemish parallel of mine throws the most remarkable light on the seal.

    It may be premised that my Carchemi.sh inscription does not read from top to

bottom, as we conceived from the Hamath the character does, but from left to right,

while both the seal inscriptions are from right to left.
     The animals are in the same order at Carchemish, apparently the secondary

first, and the male or determinative second, as should be the case according to the

comparative grammar I applied.
     Thus, instead of King Tarkondimotos being simply a king of Cilicia, as proposed

by Dr. Mordtmann, he must have been recognised on the site of the other
monuments.

     Another Carchemish parallel gives the female head, the kingly emblem, and the
Zumei character, but is accompanied b}^ a female emblem.

    On careful comparison of the seal-inscription I differ from Professor Sayce. I
find no determinative for God, and doubt if ' Land ' is a determinative, but consider

I fixed upon years ago in my first establi-shmeut of the Khita character from the

transcripts, which Capt. Burton thought to be registers of camel-marks. This

miile determinative is over the male or horned head, and I am not sure there is not

a female determinative over the other head.

     I must now communicate some further investigations, to enable the Section to

undei"stand the bearing of the facts before them. I was surprised to see a beast's
head where I had expected to find the symbol of a man's head ; but I saw that this
head and the two heads figured in Carchemish sculpture, and in Capt. Gill's West
China MSS., with this remarkable peculiarity, that the hair or beard under the
chin of the beast is marked with three strokes.

    I know that 3 is a sign for plural and collective, and 3 hairs represents many hairs.
     There are also three strokes on each of the two copies of the kingly emblem
and the seal, which may imply Great King.
    I know that in the languages that I have assigned for the comparative philology
of Khita, Tara and Kun figure for king, but as all such roots have several mean-
ings, it struck me on reflection that the words might also mean animals.
    On examination, I found that all the ancient words for king (and those now
used in Africa) figure also in the names for animals, and afterwards that the names
for God (and so far as I know Fetish) so figure. These are facts in perfect con-

formity with anthropological knowledge.
     The animal, in our inscriptions represented by his head or mask, is the totem or

--fetish of the man iu this case of the king.

    Why there should be two is, it maj^ be presumed, to have a fortunate pair, a

male and female, and for the same reason the inscription on the seal is double for
the right and left hand of the king. On the earliest coins two animals were found.

     Applying our anthropological knowledge we obtain a direct totem and fetish
explanation from the ' Khita ' mythology for that adopted from the ancients by the

Greeks. This explains to us the animal metamorphoses of the gods, heroes, and
kings, their animal emblems and animal sacrifices. The result of this will be a
final rejection of the scheme of Sanseritic weather mythology for the explanation
of more ancient anthropological facts.

    Besides our gain on that head, we now know absolutely the linguistic nature of

the Khita languages in Canaan, in Lydia, and in Etruria, whatever dialectic differ-

ences may have existed. The words Tar, ku or kun, and timme (dimi) are clear.
The latter is child, son, oSspring,

     It is separable, we see, at Carchemish, so that the name became Tarkun, like the

 Etruscan Tarquin.

     The names, continued as heroic names and popular names by the Greeks, still

consisted of the lion, horse, wolf, &c., with the like termination, I)amas._
     [The emblems on the coins of Lydia, &c., are found to correspond with Lydian

words of the same sound as the names of the cities.]

   We are further in a condition to provide for Khita comparative philology and

comparative grammar from living types on the lines so long laid down by me.

7. Further Researches on the Prehistoric Belations of the Babylonian,
       Chinese, and Egyptian Characters, La^iguage, and Culture, and their

      Connection with Sign and Gesture Language. By Hyde Clarke,

       V.P.A.L

     This was in continuation of a paper on Chinese and other characters, read at the
British Association Duhhn Meeting (Journal, 1878, p. 590). The writer repeated
that the characters and languages were of common origin, but of independent develop-
ment and the mythology also. The Chinese, Egyptian, Coptic, and Babylonian were

                         ;

not truly monosyllabic ; but most of the assumed monosyllables are dissyllables.

He exhibited illustrations of two series of Chinese characters, the Tau or + series,

and the Round, 0, converted into square. The + in Chinese, differentiated, repre-

sents 10, scholar or literate, earth, son, shield, market, door, rich, finger-nail, bull,

and cow. He showed that all these differentiated cross-signs, representmg appa-

rently dissimilar ideas, are represented by words of an allied type in the cor-
responding languages. In dealing with the Round series, he gave similar illustra-
tions for the signs sun, moon, face, ring, pot, enclosed ground or field, and their
secondaries, woman, mother, blood, and also the numerals, four aud two. In this
series the Akkad or Babylonian characters conform, and, to some extent, Egyptian
aud Mexican. Mr. Clarke then passed to the Akkad phonetics, and these he showed
were illustrated by the corresponding languages, so that the phonetics in Babylonia
and China must have been invented by the "pre-Akkad races, before the develop-
ment of the Babylonian, and were not "invented in Babylonia. The characters and
the languages he connected witli sign or gesture language. Extending the illus-
trations by Col. Mallery, U.S.A., of the relations of the signs of the North American
Indians with Egyptian characters, Mr. Clarke gave further illustrations, and
showed that there were a common psychological relation of the pre-historic languages
and characters with the signs and gestures. Thus the languages and characters

were founded on the signs and not the reverse. He exhibited from the signs the

community of features between the signs and the languages. In reference to the
population which had propagated early culture throughout the world, he still main-
tained that it was a white race, which had been seated in the highland and lake
regions of Africa, and the migrations of which explain the early history of Egypt,

of Western Asia, and Europe, and the other regions of the world.

  8. On the ' Vei Syllalary ' of Liberia, West Afica. By Hyde Clarke,

                                                         V.P.A.I.

     This syllabary had been discovered about 1849, by Lieut. Forbes, R.N., and
chronicled* by Rev. Dr. Koelle. The latter had been informed that it was invented
by one Doala Bakere, and it was regarded as a imique example of such invention in
those days. Mr. Clarke pointed out that it was not an alphabet, modelled on the
neighbouring English, Arabic, or even Barber, but was a syllabary on the ancient
model. The characters, sometimes ideographs, were not casual, but the exact
reproduction of Khita (Hittite), West China, ancient Shwo-wen Chinese, and
Babylonian, with occasional Egyptian, Libyan, Tamashek, and Berber, Cypriote,
and Iberian. It was also occasionally written from top to bottom like Khita, &c.
*l' [-+-] was employed alone and in combination, and also other well-known types.

He therefore did not doubt that the Vei represented an ancient syllabary, and that

it would be most valuable for the illustration of Khita and other ancient characters.

He repeated his observation that the Iberian wag of common origin with the other

ancient characters. Mr. Clarke referred to a Vei legend of Lake Zontori, to which
on the conquest of the country the aboriginal king and his warriors had retired,
aiid where their souls still dwell, and their songs are still heard. This is the
parallel of the legend of Lake Fuciuus, in Italy, and it had also Lydian connexions,
while Veil was in Etruria on one side of Rome, and Fucinus on the other.

Attaching to a lake Fuguene in New Granada was an allied legend. He showed

that the Vei incidentally supported the Turanian origin maintained by him for
the Runes and northern mythology and culture.

     The Chairman delivered the following Address :
In the spring of the present year, Professor Huxley delivered an address at the
Royal Institution, to which he gave the felicitous title of ' The Coming of Age of

the Origin of Species.' It is, as he pointed out, twenty-one years since Mr. Darwin's
great work was published, and the present occasion is an appropriate one to review
the effect which it has had on the progress of biological knowledge.

     There is, I may venture to say, no department of biology the growth of which

has not been profoundly influenced by the Darwinian theory. When Messrs. Dar-

win and Wallace first enunciated their views to the scientific world, the facts they
brought forward seemed to many naturalists insufficient to substantiate their far-
Teaching conclusions. Since that time an overwhelming mass of evidence has,
however, been rapidly accumulating in their favour. Facts which at first appeared
to be opposed to their theories have one by one been shown to afford striking
proofs of their truth. There are at the present time but few naturalists who do
not accept in the main the Darwinian theory, and even some of those who reject
many of Darwin's explanations still accept the fundamental position that all
animals are descended from a common stock.

     To attempt in the brief time which I have at my disposal to trace the influence

of the Darwinian theory on all the branches of anatomy and physiology would be
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

      --T1{ANSACTI0^S OF SECTIO.V D. DEPT. AXATOMY AND niYSIOLOGY. 637

wholly impossible, and I shall confine myself to an attempt to do so for a small

section only. There is perhaps no department of Biology which has been so revolu-

tionised, if I may use the term, by the theory of animal evolution, as that of

Development or Embryology. The reason of this is not far to seek. According to

the Darwinian theory, the present order of the organic world has been caused by

the action of two laws, known as the laws of heredity and of variation. Tha

law of heredity is familiarly exemplified by the well-known fact that offspring

resemble their parents. Not only, however, do the ofi'spring belong to the same

species as their parents, but they inherit the individual peculiarities of their parents.

It is on this that the breeders of cattle depend, and it is a fact of every-day ex-

Aperience amongst ourselves.      further point with reference to heredity to which I

must call your attention is the fact that the characters, which display themselves

at some special period in the life of the parent, are acquired by the offspring at a

corresponding period. Thus, in many birds the males have a special plumage

in the adult state. The male oftspring is not, however, born with the adult plumage,

but only acquires it when it becomes adult.

The law of variation is in a certain sense opposed to the law of heredity. It

asserts that the resemblance which oftspring bear to their parents is never exact.

The contradiction between the two laws is only apparent. All variations and

modifications in an organism are directly or indirectly due to its environments

that is to say, they are either produced by some direct influence acting upon the

organism itself, or by some more subtle and mysterious action on its parents; and

the law of heredity really asserts that the oftspring and parent would resemble each

other if their environments were the same. Since, however, this is never the

case, the oftspring always difter to some extent from the parents. Now, according

to the law of heredity, every acquired variation tends to be inherited, so that, by a

summation of small changes, the animals may come to differ from their parent

stock to an indefinite extent.

   We are now in a position to follow out the consequences of these two laws in

their bearing on development. Their application will best be made apparent by

taking a concrete example. Let us suppose a spot on the surface of some very

simple organism to become, at a certain period of life, pigmented, and therefore

to Be especially sensitive to light. In the oftspring of this form, the pigment-spot

will reappear at a corresponding period ; and there will therefore be a period in the

life of the oftspring during which there is no pigment-spot, and a second period in

which there is one. If a naturalist were to study the life-history, oi-, in other

words, the embryology of this form, the fact about the pigment-spot would come

to his notice, and he would be justified, from the laws of heredity, in concluding-

that the species was descended from an ancestor without a pigment-spot, because

a pigment-spot was absent in the young. Now, we may suppose the transparent

layer of skin above the pigment-spot to become tliickeued, so as gradually to fovm

a kind of lens, capable of throwing an image of external objects on the pigment-

spot. In this way a rudimentary ej'e might be evolved out of the pigment-spot.

A naturalist studying the embryology of the form with this 650 would find that

the pigment-spot was formed before the lens, and he would be justified in con-

cluding, by the same process of reasoning as before, that the ancestors of the form

Wehe was studying first acquired a pigment-spot and then a lens.                                                                                                                                           may picture

to ourselves a series of steps by which the simple eye, the origin of which I have

traced, might become more complicated                                                                                                                                                        and it is easy to see how an embryologist
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

studpng the actual development of this complicated eye would be able to unravel

the process of its evolution.

The general nature of the methods of reasoning employed by embryologists, who

accept the Darwinian theory, is exemplified by the instance just given. If this

method is a legitimate one, and there is no reason to doubt it, we ought to find

that animals, iu the course of their development, pass through a series of stages, in

each  of which they resemble one  of their remote ancestors                                                                                                                                  but it is to  be remem-
                                                                                                                                                       ;

bered that, in accordance with the law of variation, there is a continual tendency to

change, and that the longer this tendency acts the greater will be the total efl'ect.

Owing to this tendency, we should not expect to find a perfect resemblance
--638 REPORT 1880.

"between an animal, at different stages of its growth, and its ancestors ; and the re-

moter the ancestors, the less close ought the resemblance to be. In spite, however,

of this limitation, it may be laid down as one of the consequences of the law of

inheritance that every animal ought, in the course of its individual development, to

repeat with more or less fidelity the history of its ancestral evolution.

   A direct verification of this proposition is scarcely possible. There is ample

ground for concluding that the forms from which existing animals are descended

have in most instances perished ; and although there is no reason why they should

not have been preserved in a fossil state, yet, owing to the imperfection of the
geological record, palaeontology is not so often of service as might have been hoped.

     While for the reasons just stated, it is not generally possible to prove by direct

observation that existing forms in their embryonic state repeat the characters of

their ancestors, there is another method by which the truth of this proposition can

be approximately verified.

   A comparison of recent and fossil forms shows that there are actually li-\-ing at

the present day representatives of a considerable proportion of the gxoups which have

in previous times existed on the globe, and' there are therefore forms allied to the

ancestors of those living at the present day, though not actually the same species.

If therefore it can be shown that the embryos of existing forms pass through

etao-es in which they have the characters of more primitive groups, a sufficient

proof of our proposition will have been given.

That such is often the case is a well-known fact, and was even known before

the publication of Darwin's works. Von Baer, the gi-eatest embryologist of the

century, who died at an advanced age but a few j'ears ago, discussed the proposition
at considerable length in a work published between the years 1830 and 1840. He

came to the conclusion that the embryos of higher forms never actually resemble

lower forms but only the embryos of lower forms ; and he further maintained that

such resemblances did not hold at all, or only to a very small extent, beyond the

limits of the laro'er groups. Thus he believed that, though the embryos of Verte-

Webrates mio'ht ao-ree amongst themselves, there was no resemblance between them and
the embryos of any invertebrate group.          now know that these limitations of

Von Baer do not hold good, but it is to be remembered that the meaning notu

attached by embryologists to such resemblances was quite unknown to him.
    These preliminary remarks will, I trust, be sufficient to demonstrate how com-

pletely modern embryological reasoning is dependent on the two laws of inheritance

and variation, which constitute the keystones of the Darwinian theory.

    Before the appearance of the ' Origin of Species ' many very valuable embryo-

loo-ical investio-ations were made, but the facts discovered were to their authors

merely so many ultimate facts, which admitted of being classified, but could not
be explained. No explanation could be offered of why it is that animals, instead of

developing in a simple and strfughtforward way, undergo in the course of their

growth a series of complicated changes, during which they often acquire organs

which have no function, and which, after remaining visible for a short time,

disappear without leaving a trace.

    No explanation, for instance, could be offered of why it is that a frog in the
course of its o-rowth has a stage in which it breathes like a fish, and then why it is

like a newt with a long tail, which gi-adually becomes absorbed, and finally disappears.
To the Darwinian the explanation of such facts is obvious. The stage when the
tadpole breathes by gills is a repetition of the stage when the ancestors of the frog had

not advanced in the scale of development beyond a fish, while the newt-like stage

implies that the ancestors of the frog were at one time organised very much like

the newts of to-day. The explanation of such facts has opened out to the embryo-
logist quite a new series of problems. These problems may be divided into two

main gi-oups, technically known as those of phjlogeny and those of organogeny.

AThe problems of phylogeny deal with the genealogy of the animal Idngdom.

complete genealogy would form what is known as a natural classification. To
attempt to form such a classification has long been the aim of a large number of

naturalists, and it has frequently been attempted without the aid of embryology.

The statements made in the earlier part of my address clearly show how great an

assistance embryologj' is    capable  of giving                                   in  phylogeny                                                    and  as  a matter of fact
                                                                                                                                                ;

embryology bas been during the last few years very widely employed in all phylo-

genetic questions, and the results which have been arrived at have in manv cases

been very striking. To deal with these results in detail would lead me into too
technical a department of my subject ; but I may point out that amongst the more

striking of the results obtained entirely by embryological methods is the demon-

stration that the Vertebrata are not, as was nearly universally believed by older

naturalists, separated by a wide gulf from the Invertebrata, but that there is a
group of animals, known as the Ascidians, formerly united with the Invertebrata,

which is now universally placed in the same class with the Vertebrata.

The discoveries recently made in organogeny, or the genesis of organs, have

been quite as striking, and in many respects even more interesting, than those in
phylogeny, and I propose devoting the remainder of my address to a history of

results which have been arrived at with reference to the origin of the nervous

system.

To render clear the nature of these results I must say a few words as to the

structm-e of the animal body. The body is always built of certain pieces of proto-
plasm, which are technically known to biologists as cells. The simplest organisms

are composed either of a single piece of this kind, or of several similar pieces loosely

aggregated together. Each of these pieces or cells is capable of digesting and

assimilating food,  and  of  respiring                                            it can execute movements, and                                             is  sensitive  to
                                                                               ;

external stimuli, and can reproduce itself. All the functions of higher animals can,

in fact, be carried on in this single cell. Such lowly organised forms are known

to naturalists as the Protozoa. All other animals are also composed of cells, but

these cells are no longer complete organisms in themselves. They exhibit a division

of labour :  some carrying on  the work                                           of digestion                                                  some, which we  call  nerve-
                                                                                                                                             ;

cells, receiving and conducting stimuli ; some, which we call muscle-cells, altering

-- --their form in fact, contracting in one direction under the action of the stimuli

brought to them by the nerve-cells. In most cases a number of cells with the

same function are united together, and thus constitute a tissue. Thus the cells
which carry on the work of digestion form a lining membrane to a tube or sac, and
constitute a tissue known as a secretory epithelium. The whole of the animals with

bodies composed of definite tissues of this kind are known as the Metazoa.

   A considerable number of early developmental processes are common to the

whole of the Metazoa.

     In the first place every Metazoon commences its existence as a simple cell, in
the sense above defined ; this cell is known as the ovum. The first developmental

process which takes place consists in the division or segmentation of the single cell
into a number of smaller cells. The cells then arrange themselves into two

groups or layers known to embryologists as the primary germinal layers. These

two layers are usually placed one within the other round a central cavity. The

inner of the two is called the hypoblast, the outer the epiblast. The existence of

these two layers in the embryos of vertebrated animals was made out early in the

present century by Pander, and his observations were greatly extended by Von Baer

and Remak. But it was supposed that these layers were confined to vertebrated

animals. In the year 1849, and at greater length in 1859, Huxley demonstrated

--that the bodies of all the polype tribe or Ocelenterata that is to say of the group
--to which the common polype, the jelly-fish, and the sea-anemone belong were com-

posed of two layers of cells, and stated that in his opinion these two layers were

homologous with the epiblast and hypoblast of vertebrate embryos. This very

brilliant discovery came before its time. It fell upon barren ground, and for a

long time bore no fruit. In the year 1866 a young Russian- naturalist named

Kowalevsky began to study by special histological methods the development of

a number of iuvertebrated forms of animals, and discovered that at an early

stage of development the bodies of all these animals were divided into germinal

layers like those in vertebrates. Biologists were not long in recognising the im-

portance of these discoveries, and they formed the basis of two remarkable essays,

one by our own countryman, Professor Lankester, and the other by a distinguished

German naturalist, Professor Haeckel, of Jena.
640 EEPORT-- 1880.

     In these essaj^s the attempt was made to show that the stape in development
already spoken of, in which the cells are arranged in the form of two layers en-

closing a central cavity has an ancestral meaning, and that it is to he interpreted
to signify that all the Metazoa are descended from an ancestor which had a more or
less oval form, with a central digestive cavity provided with a single opening,
serving both for the introduction of food and for the ejection of indigestible
substances. The body of this ancestor was supposed to have been a double-walled

sac formed of an inner layer, the hA-poblast, lining the digestive cavity, and an

outer layer, the epiblast. To this form Haeckel gave the name of gastrsea or

gastrula.

     There is every reason to think that Lankester and Haeckel were quite justified
in concluding that a form more or less like that just described was the ancestor of
the Metazoa ; but the further speculations contained in their essays as to the origin
of this form from the Protozoa can only be regarded as suggestive feelers, which,
however, have been of great importance in stimulating and directing embryological
research. It is, moreover, very doubtful whether there are to be found in the de-
velopmental histories of most animals any traces of this gastrsea ancestor, other than
the fact of their passing through a stage in which the cells are divided into two

germinal layers.

     The key to the nature of the two germinal layers is to be found in Huxley's
comparison between them, and the two layers in the fresh-water polype and the
sea-anemone. The epiblast is the primitive skin, and the lij-poblast is the primitive

epithelial wall of the alimentary tract.

In the whole of the pohpe group, or Ocelenterata, the body remains through

life composed of the two layers, which Huxley recognised as homologous with the

epiblast and hypoblast of "the Vertebrata ; but in all the higher Metazoa a third

germinal layer, known as the mesoblast, early makes its appearance between the

two primary layers. The mesoblast originates as a differentiation of one or of

both the primary germinal layers ; but although the different views which have

been held as to its mode of origin form an important section of the history of

recent embryological investigations, I must for the moment confine myself to

--saying that from this layer there take their origin the whole of the muscular

system, of the vascular system, and of that connective-tissue system which forms

the internal skeleton, tendons, and other parts.

   We have seen that the epiblast represents the skin or epidermis of the simple

sac-like ancestor common to all the Metazoa. In all the higher Metazoa it gives

rise, as might be expected, to the epidermis, but it gives rise at the same time to a

number of other organs ; and, in accordance with the principles laid down in the

myearlier part of   address, it is to be concluded that the orcjans so derived have been

formed as differe^itiations of the primitive epidermis. One of the most interesting of

recent embryological discoveries is the fact that the nervous system is, in all but a

very few doubtful cases, derived from the epiblast. This fact was made out for

vertebrate animals by the great embryologist Von Baer ; and the Russian naturalist

liowalevsky, to whose researches I have already alluded, showed that this was

true for a large number of invertebrate animals. The derivation of the nervous

system from the epiblast has since been made out for a sufficient number of forms

satisfactorily to establish the generalisation that it is all but universally derived

from the epiblast.

In any animal in which there is no distinct nervous system, it is obvious that

the general surface of the body must be sensitive to the action of its surroundings,
Weor to what are technically called stimuli.
                                              know experimentally that this is so

in the case of the Protozoa, and of some very simple Metazoa, such as the fresh-

water Polype or Hydra. The skin or epidermis of the ancestor of the Metazoa

was no doubt similarly sensitive ; and the fact of the nervous system being

derived from the epiblast implies that the functions of the central nervous

system, which were originally taken by the whole skin, became gradually

concentrated in a special part of the skin which was step by step removed

from the surface, and finally became a well-defined organ in the interior of the

body.

HowWhat were the steps by wliicli tliis remarkable process took place ?  has

it come about that there are nerves passing from the central nervous system to all

Howparts of the skin, and also to the muscles ?  have the arrangements for reflex

actions arisen by which stimuli received on the surface of the body are carried to

the central part of the nervous system, and are thence transmitted to the appropriate

muscles, and cause them to contract ? All these questions require to be answered
before we can be said to possess a satisfactory knowledge of the origin of the
nervous system. As yet, however, the knowledge of these points derived from

embryology is imperfect, although there is every hope that further investigation

will render it less so ? Fortunately, however, a study of comparative anatomy,

especially that of the Coelenterata, hils up some of the gaps left from our study of

embryology.

    From embryology we learn that the ganglion-cells of the central part of the

nervous system are originally derived from the simple undifferentiated epithelial

Wecells of the surface of the body.  further learn that the nerves are out-growths

of the central nervous system. It was supposed till quite recently that the nerves

in Vertebrates were derived from parts of the middle germinal layer or mesoblast,

and that they only became secondarily connected with the central nervous system.

This is now known not to be the case, but the nerves are formed as processes

growing out from the central part of the nervous system.

Another important fact shown by embryology is that the central nervous system,

and percipient portion of the organs of special sense, are often formed from the

same part of the primitive epidermis. Thus, in ourselves and in other vertebrate

animals the sensitive part of the eye, known as the retina, is formed from two

lateral lobes of the front part of the primitive brain. The crystalline lens and

cornea of the eye are, however, subsequently formed from the skin.

The same is true for the peculiar compound eyes of crabs or Crustacea. The

most important part of the central nervous system of these animals is the
supraoesophageal ganglia, often known as the brain, and these are formed in the

embryo from two thickened patches of the skin at the front end of the body. These

thickened patches become gradually detached from the surface, remaining covered

over by a layer of skin. They then constitute the supracesophageal ganglia ; but
they form not only the ganglia, but also the rhabdons or retinal elements of the

--eye the parts in fact which correspond to the rods and cones in our own retina.

The layer of epidermis or skin which lies immediately above the supraoesophageal

ganglia becomes gradually converted into the refractive media of the crustacean eye.

A cuticle which lies on its surface forms the peculiar facets on the surface of the

eye, which are known as the corneal lenses, while the cells of the epidermis give
rise to lens-like bodies known as the crystalline cones.

It would be easy to quote further instances of the same kind, but I trust that

the two which I have given will be sufficient to show the kind of relation which

often exists between the organs of special sense, especially those of vision, and

the central nervous system. It might have been anticipated djmori that organs

of special sense would only appear in animals provided with a well-developed

central nervous system. This, however, is not the case. Special cells, with long

delicate hairs, which are imdoubtedly highly sensitive structures, are present in
animals in which as yet nothing has been found which could be called a central

nervous system ; and there is ever}' reason to think that the organs of special sense

originated ;;wj jjrtSi'ii with the central nervous system. It is probable that in the

simplest organisms the whole body is sensitive to light, but that with the ap-

pearance of pigment-cells in certain parts of the body, the sensitiveness to light

became localised to the areas where the pigment-cells were present. Since, how-

ever, it was necessary that stimuli received in such areas should be communicated

to other parts of the body, some of the epidermic cells in the neighbourhood of the

pigment-spots, which were at first only sensitive in the same manner as other cells

of the epidermis, became gradually differentiated into special nerve-cells. As to

the details of this differentiation, embryology does not as yet throw any great

light ; but from the study of comparative anatomy there are grounds for thinking
that it was somewhat as follows : --Cells placed on the surface sent protoplasmic

processes of a nervous nature inwards, which came into connection with nervous
processes from similar celk placed in other parts of the body. The cells with
such processes then became removed from the surface, forming a deeper layer of
the epidermis below the sensitive cells of the organ of vision. With these cells
they remained connected by protoplasmic filaments, and thus they came to form
a thickening of the epidermis underneath the organ of vision, the cells of which
received their stimuli from those of the organ of vision, and transmitted the
stimuli so received to other parts of the body. Such a thickening would obviously
be the rudiment of a central nervous system, and it is easy to see by what steps
it might become gradually larger and more important, and might gradually travel
inwards, remaining connected with the sense organ at the surface by protoplasmic
filaments, which would then constitute nerves. The rudimentary eye would at
first merely_ consist of cells sensitive to light ; at a later period there would be
formed optical structures constituting the lens, which would throw an image of
external objects upon it, and so convert the whole structure into a true organ of
vision. It has thus come about that, in the development of the individual, the
retina or sensitive part of the eye is first formed in connection with the central
nervous system, while the lenses of the eye are independently evolved from the

epidermis at a later period.

     The general features of the origin of the nervous system which have so far
been made out by means of the study of embryology are the following :

     (1) That the nervous system of the higher Metazoa has been developed in the
course of a long series of generations by a gradual process of differentiation of
parts of the epidermis.

     (2) That part of the central nervous system of many forms arose as a local col-

lection of nerve-cells in the epidermis, in the neighbourhood of rudimentary organs
of vision.

     (3) That ganglion cells have been evolved from simple epithelial cells of the

epidermis.

     (4) That the primitive nerves were outgrowths of the original ganglion cells
and that the nerves of the higher forms are formed as outgrowths of the central
nervous system.

     The points on which embryology has not yet thrown a satisfactory light are :
     (1) The steps by which the protoplasmic processes, from the primitive epi-
dermic cells, became united together so as to form a network of nerve-fibres,
placing the various parts of the body in nervous communication.
     (2) The process by which nerves became connected with muscles, so that a
stimulus received by a nerve-cell could be communicated to and cause a contrac-

tion in a muscle.
      Recent investigations on the anatomj^ of the Ooelenterata, especially of jelly-

fish and sea-anemones, have thrown some light on these points, although there is
left much that is still obscure.

     In our own country Mr. Romanes has conducted some interesting physiological
 experiments on these forms ; and Professor Schafer has made some important
histological investigations upon them. In Germany a series of valuable researches
have also been made on this group by Professors Kleinenberg, Glaus and Eimer,
 and more especially by the brothers Hertwig, of Jena. Careful histological in-
 vestigations, especially those of the last-named authors, have made us acquainted
with the forms of some very primitive types of nervous system. In the common

 sea-anemones there are, for instance, no organs of special sense, and no definite
 central nervous system. There are, however, scattered throughout the sldn, and
 also throughout the lining of the digestive tract, a number of specially modified
 epithelial cells, which are no doubt delicate organs of sense. They are provided
 at their free extremity with a long hair, and are prolonged on their inner side into
 a fine process which penetrates the deeper part of the epithelial layer of the skin or
 digestive wall. They eventually join a fine network of protoplasmic fibres which
 forms a special layer immediately within the epithelium. The fibres of this net-
 work are no doubt essentially nervous. In addition to fibres there are, moreover,
 present in the network cells of the same character as the multipolar ganglion-cells in
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 643

the neryous system of Vertebrates, and some of these cells are characterised by send-

ing a process into the superjacent epithelium. Such cells are obviously epithelial

cells in the act of becoming nerve-cells; and it is probable that the nerve-cells are,

in fact, sense-cells which have travelled inwards and lost their epithelial character.

There is every reason to think that tlie network just described is not only con-

tinuous with the sense-cells in the epithelium, but that it is also continuous with

epithelial cells which are provided with muscular prolongations. The nervous

system thus consists of a network of protoplasmic fibres, continuous on the one

hand with sense-cells in the epithelium, and on the other with muscular cells.

The nervous network is generally distributed both beneath the epithelium of the

skin and that of the digestive tract, but is especially concentrated in the disc-like

region between the mouth and tentacles. The above observations have tlirown a

very clear light on the characters of the nervous system at an early stage of its

evolution, but they leave unanswered the questions (1) how the nervous network
first arose, and (2) how its fibres became continuous with muscles. It is probable
that the nervous network took its origin from processes of the sense-cells. The

processes of the ditterent cells probably first met and then fused together, and,

becoming more arborescent, finally gave rise to a complicated network.

The connection between this network and the muscular cells also probably took

place by a process of contact and fusion.

Epithelial cells with muscular processes were discovered by Kleinenberg be-

fore epithelial cells with nervous processes were known, and he suggested that

the epithelial part of such cells was a sense-organ, and that the connecting part

between this and the contractile processes was a rudimentary nerve. This in-

genious theory explained completely the fact of nerves being continuous with

muscles ; but on the further discoveries being made which I have just described, it
became obvious that this theory would have to be abandoned, and that some other

explanation would have to be given of the continuity between nerves and muscles.

The hypothetical explanation just offered is that of fusion.
      It seems very probable that many of the epithelial cells were originally provided

with processes the protoplasm of which, like the protoplasm of the Protozoa, carried

on the functions of nerves and muscles at the same time, and that these processes

united amongst themselves into a network. By a process of differentiation parts
of this network may have become specially contractile, and other parts may have lost
their contractility and become solely nervous. In this way the connection between

nerves and muscles might be explained, and this hypothesis fits in very well with

the condition of the neuro-muscular system as we find it in the Coelenterata.

The nervous system of the higher Metazoa appears then to have originated from

a differentiation of some of the superficial epithelial cells of the body, though it is

possible that some parts of the system may have been formed by a differentiation

of the alimentary epithelium. The cells of the epithelium were most likely at the

same time contractile and sensory, and the differentiation of the nervous system

may very probably have commenced, in the first instance, from a specialisation in

the function of part of a network formed of neuro-muscular prolongations of

Aepithelial cells.  simultaneous differentiation of other parts of the network into

muscular fibres may have led to the continuity at present obtaining between nerves

and muscles.

Local differentiations of the nervous network, which was no doubt distributed

over the whole body, took place on the formation of organs of special sense, and

such differentiations gave rise to the formation of a central nervous system. The

central nervous system was at first continuous with the epidermis, but became

separated from it and travelled inwards. Ganglion-cells took their origin from

sensory epithelial cells, provided with prolongations, continuous with the nervous

network. Such epithelial cells gradually lost their epithelial character, and finally
became completely detached from the epidermis.

    Nerves, such as we find them in the higher types, originated from special

differentiations of the nervous network, radiating from the parts of the central

nervous system.

Suchj briefly, is the present state of our knowledge as to the genesis of the

                    TT2
644 EEPOET-- 1880.

nervous system. I ought not, however, to leave this subject without saying a few
words as to the hypothetical view? which the distinguished evolutionist Mr. Herbert
Spencer has put forward on this subject in his work on Psychology.

      For Herbert Spencer nerves have originated, not as processes of epithelial cells,
but from the passage of motion along the lines of least resistance. The nerves would
seem, according to this view, to have been formed in any tissue from the continuous

Apassage of nervous impulses through it. ' wave of molecular disturbance,' he

says, ' passing along a tract of mingled colloids closely allied in composition, and
isomerically transforming the molecules of one of them, will be apt at the same
time to form some new molecules of the same type,' and thus a nerve becomes

established.

    A nervous centre is formed, according to Herbert Spencer, at the point in the

colloid in which nerves are generated, wliere a single nervous wave breaks up, and
its parts diverge along various lines of least resistance. At such points some of
the nerve-colloid will remain in an amorphous state, and as the wave of molecular
motion will there be checked, it will tend to cause decompositions amongst the un-
arranged molecules. The decompositions must, he says, cause ' additional molecular
motion to be disengaged ; so that along the outgoing lines there will be discharged
an augmented wave. Thus there will arise at this point something having the

character of a ganglion corpuscle.'

     These hypotheses of Herbert Spencer, which have been widely adopted in this
country, are, it appears to me, not borne out by the discoveries to which I have
called your attention to-day. The discovery that nerves have been developed from
processes of epithelial cells, gives a very diflerent conception of their genesis to
that of Herbert Spencer, which makes them originate from the passage of nervous
impulses through a tract of mingled colloids; while the demonstration that
ganglion-cells arose as epithelial cells of special sense, which have travelled inwards
from the surface, admits still less of a reconciliation with Herbert Spencer's view
on the same subject.

     Although the present state of our knowledge on the genesis of the nervous
system is a great ad\auce on that of a few years ago, there is still much remaining
to be done to make it complete.

     The subject is well worth the attention of the morphologist, the physiologist, or

·even of the psychologist, and we must not remain satisfied by filling up the gaps
in our knowledge by such hypotheses as 1 have been compelled to frame. New

methods of research will probably be required to grapple with the problems that

are still unsolved ; but when we look back and surA'ey what has been done in the

.past, there can be no reason for mistrusting our advance in the future.

      The hypothesis of Gegenbam- and Fiirbringer as to the relation of the head-
kidney to the hinder part of the excretory sj'stem was considered, the objections to
 it pointed out, and the following hypothesis put forward. The head-kidney is the
 anterior part of a primitive excretory organ possessed by some ancestral vertebrate,
 the posterior part of which has persisted as the Wolffian body. In support of this
 view it was pointed out that the structure of the head-lridney essentially resembles
 that of the Wolffian body. It was further noticed that, though at first sight the
 development of these two organs is entirely different, on a closer examination they
 are found to present a development fundamentally similar. The development of
 the Wolffian body in Amphibia and other animals with a head-kidney must be con-

sidered as very much modified and in no way representing the phylogenetic history
·while that in Elasmobranchii, in which there is no head-kidney, may he looked
upon as much more primitive.

     Comparing the development of the Wolffian body in Elasmobranchii with that
of the head-kidney in Amphibia, the fundamental similarity between them is at

once apparent.

The Pbesibent delivered the following Address :

My recent predecessors in this chair have dealt, with a knowledge and ability

with which I cannot vie, not only with great problems in terrestrial physics, such

as the genesis of our oceans, continents, and mountain-chains ; the circulation of

the waters of the ocean, with its consequences on climate ; the reciprocal influence

of conditions of nature upon man, and of man's ability to modify those conditions

but also on the progress of geographical discovery on the great theatres of political

interest or commercial rivalry ; and the archaeology of our science, as regards Asia,

has been touched by a master's hand. Turning, then, from themes on which I

could offer nothing worthy of your attention, I find, with a sense of relief, that

there is a region of the globe, and it is one with which I have the most personal

acquaintance, which has received very little attention at their hands. I refer to

the great continent of America, and more especially its northern portion ; and I

hope for your indulgence if I enlarge a little upon that theme.

How vast have been, in very recent times, tlie additions to our knowledge in

"that quarter, how continuous is the progress of discovery, cannot, I think, but

worthily occupy your attention for a few minutes. In other regions Geogi-aphy is
Wethe pioneer of Civilisation and Commerce.
                                             look, and often look long, for

their footsteps to follow. Here for the first time she has been outstripped, for the

telegi-aph and the railway have tracked the forest or prairie, and traversed the

mountains by paths before unknown to her.

I remember that patriarch of science. Sir Edward Sabine, once telling me how

eao-erly he, as a young man, had desired to retread the footsteps of Lewis and

Clarke, whose journey from St. Louis to the Pacific in 1805, was at the time, and

must long remain, one of the most remarkable achievements on record.

Let me, then, remind you that within living memory (I grant, a long one) no tra-

veller known to fame had crossed the American continent from east to west, except

Alexander Mackenzie, in 1793. No traveller had reached the American Polar

Sea by land, except the same illustrious explorer and Samuel Hearne. The British

Admiralty had not long before instructed Captain Vancouver to search on the

coast of the Pacific for some near communication with a river flowing into or out

of the Lake of the Woods. The fabulous Straits of Annian are to be found on
maps of the last century. ' The sacred fires of Montezuma ' were still burning in

secluded valleys of Upper California when her Majesty ascended the throne.
    It is very interesting to observe that De la Hontan, whose name has been

recently given by the American geologists to the basin of the great Miocene Sea,

now represented by Carson Lake in Nevada, ascended the Mississippi, and even

penetrated up the Yellowstone, very nearly to the ' National Park,' at all events

into the present territory of Montana, so early as 1687. He introduces into his

pursuing the attractive theme offered by historical geography, and must not dwell

ment against Mexico ;  the discovery of the  precious  metals                                    the  explorations  for

the geological surveys of the American and Canadian Governments. These have

all resulted in a surprising extension of geographical knowledge, without any of

them having it particularly in view. It was a bold figure of speech of Lord

Dufi'erin's which described the Rocky Mountains in 1877 as being nearly ' as full

of theodolites as they could hold,' but the Dominion Government has spent about

three-quarters of a million sterling on explorations or surveys for their railway, and

we have only to glance at a recent map to discover nine sovereign states, and seven

territories, west of the Mississippi, bounded by right lines, which neither war nor

diplomacy has determined, laid out like garden-plots, to see that neither Asia nor

Africa have unfolded more of their secrets in our times, than has the nobler

continent where Britain has cast her swarms.

The thoroughness characteristic of the scientific operations of the American

Government has been greatly favoured by the physical features of the region of

their trigonometrical survey, in the American Cordilleras. Sharp roclry peaks, bare

of vegetation, rise to altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet, at convenient distances of

60 to 80 miles apart, so situated as to form well-conditioned triangles, while the

purity of the atmosphere makes observation easy. In this manner has an im-

mense region comprising some 87,000 square miles in Nevada, Utah, and Colo-

rado, been topographically surveyed since 1867 ; not indeed with the detail of a

Eiuopean national survey, but with all the accuracy required for first settlement.

The two prehistoric seas, now designated Lake Bonneville, of which Salt Lake is
the remains, aud Lake La Hontan, already referred to, have been defined, and

facts of remarkable physical interest have been ascertained. The evaporation of

Great Salt Lake, for example, is no longer in excess of its annual tribute ; it has

risen 11 feet since 1806. The natural basin of Pyramid Lake is now full, its

level has risen 9 feet, and the overflow is filling up Winuemucca Lake in like

manner ; the latter lake has risen 22 feet, and its area has doubled within the

Wesame short period.     cannot allow the geologists to monopolise the interest

of these physical changes, which the magnificent volume of Mr. Clarence King has

presented to them.

Lying a little to the east and south of the region just referred to is another,

which includes yet loftier mountains, and has been surveyed by Professor Haj'deu.

Here, on the tributaries of the rivers Colorado and S. Juan, we find those mj'sterious

monuments of an extinct civilisation and a dying people, the cliff-houses on the

Rio Mancos  and Rio  de  Chelly, the  Pueblos  of the  Chaso  Canon                                   and  here     the

tion. No less than eighteen summits in the Sierra Blanca have been found to rise

above 14,000 feet. Blanca Peak, in South Colorado, attains 14,464 feet, and is the

monarch of mountains, if such there may be, in the great Republic. Lake Tahoe,

the largest of western lakes, familiar to readers of the brilliant pages of Miss Bird,

was surveyed by Lieutenant Macomb in 1877, and the height of Pyramid Peak

Aascertained to be 10,003 feet.  town of 20,000 inhabitants (Leadville, Colo.) has

sprung into being at an elevation of 11,000 feet, which ranks it among the highest

inhabited places on the globe.

Very different in their character are the survey operations of the Canadian

Government in the north-west, where the problem presented is to prepare a vast

territory, wholly wanting in conspicuous points, for being laid out in townships of

uniform area, and farms of uniform acreage. The law requires that the eastern

and western boundaries of every township be true astronomical meridians and that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

the sphericity of the earth's figure be duly allowed for, so that the northern

boundary must be less in measurement than the southern. All lines are required

to be gone over twice with chains of unequal length, and the land surveyors are

checked by astronomical determinations. In carrying out this operation, which

will be seen to he one of great nicety, tive principal meridians have been rigorously

--determined, and in part traced the 97tli, 102nd, 106th, 110th, and 114th; and

fourteen base-lines, connecting them, have been measured and marked. One of

these, on the parallel of 52' 10', is 183 miles long. Eleven astronomical stations

have been fixed since 1876, and from these sixty-six determinate points have been

fixed in latitude, forty-five in longitude, often under conditions of no little difficulty

from the severity of the climate. The claims of .Messrs. Alexander and Lindsay

Russell, of Mr. Aldous, and Mr. King, the observers, to rank as scientific travellers,

will, I am sure, be warmly recognised by this Section.

The sources of the Frazer river were first reached in February 1875, and found

in a semicircular basin, completely closed in by glaciers and high bare peaks, at an

W.elevation of 5300 feet. The hardy discoverer, Mr. E.  Jarvis, travelled in the

course of that exploration 900 miles on snow-shoes, mucli of it with the ther-
mometer below the temperature of freezing mercury, and lived for the last three

days, as he expresses it, ' on the anticipation of a meal at the journey's end.'

   We are still imperfectly acquainted with the region north of the parallel of 50°

in British Columbia, where the Canadian engineers have long been searching for a

practicable railway line from one or other of three known passes of the Rocky

Mountains proper, through the tremendous gorges of the Cascade Mountains, to the

Pacific. These passes are, the Yellowhead, at an elevation of 3645 feet, the Pine

river, at 2800 feet, and the Peace river, said to be only 1650 feet above the sea, all
of them comparing very favourably in respect to height with the other trans-

continental railways. The Union Pacific Railway, for example, runs, as you will

remember, for 1500 miles at elevations of over 4500 feet, and its summit level is

8242 feet. The Dominion Government has recently adopted a line from the
Yellowhead Pass to Burrard Inlet, which may be made out in any good map by

following the course of the Thompson and Frazer rivers. By this line the Pacific

coast will be reached in 1945 miles from Lake Superior, and it is already partly

under contract. This is not a place to enter upou engineering details. I will only

remark that greater difficulties have seldom been presented to human enterprise

than must here be conquered. That peculiar feature in physical geography, the

cafion or deep gorge, of which the Via Mala is an example familiar to many

persons, is presented all over the region upon a scale of grandeur unsurpassed.

When not perpendicular clift's, their sides are in these latitudes seamed by avalanches

on the largest scale ; while the mountain torrents which rush down them defj' navi-
gation. Mr. Jarvis describes how on one occasion having walked into a hole, con-

cealed by snow, the current caught his snow shoes, turning them upside down, and
held him like a vice, so that it required the united efforts of all his party to extri-

cate him.

There is a curious circumstance mentioned in this gentleman's nan-ative which

deserves notice, as an instance of the successful reduction of a native language to

writing, free from the difiiculties which attend the use of the Roman alphabet. He

met with a kind of notice-board or finger-post at the dividing of two tracks on the

prairie, having upon it characters, which were entirely unknown to himself and

his companions, and apparently to the Railway Department :

           '^V^^r ^-xjyj ,,^ ;0:';.,L -j^l

They are, in fact, characters of a phonetic alphabet, invented forty years ago by a
Mr. Evans, a Wesleyan missionary among the Cree Indians, and are extremely-
well adapted for expressing their liquid polysyllabic language. That they should
have survived the generation to which they were first taught, and be still used for

Pacific terminus of their railway, relegates to the domain of pure geography a
great deal of knowledge acquired" in exploring other lines : explorations in which
Messrs. Jarvis, lioretskv, Keefer, and others, have displayed remarkable darmg and
endurance. They have forced their way from the interior to the sea-coast or from

the coast to the" Peace Eiver, Pine or Yellowhead Passes, through country pre-
viously unknown, to Port Simpson, to Burke Channel, to the mouth of the Skeena,
and to Bute Inlet, so that a region but recently almost a blank on our maps, which
John Arrowsmith, our last great authority, left very imperfectly sketched, is iiow
known in great detail, and 1 regret to add, the better known, the less admired. The
botany has been reported on by Mr. Macoun, and the geology by Dr. Dawson,

jm-i passu with its topography. I have great hope that the Section will receive
from the last-named traveller in person some account of his many arduous

journeys in the prosecution of geological research. Of these, the latest is the

exploration of Queen Charlotte Islands, a part of the British possessions, very

little known to most of us, although we had a communication on the subject_ in

1868. He regards them as a partly submerged mountain chain, a continuation
north-westward of that of Vancouver's Island and of the Olympian Mountains in

Washington Territory. An island, loG miles long and 56 wide, enjoying a tem-

perate climate, and covered with forests of timber of some value (chiefly Abies

Menziesi), is not likely to be left to nature much longer. But the customs of the

natives in regard to the inheritance and transfer of land are unfavourable to settle-

ment, and will demand just and wise consideration when the hour comes. It is as

much private property as any estate in Wales.

    Mr. Dawson's report contains a vocabulary of the language, wluch presents this

peculiarity, that the words expressing family relationship vary with the speaker.

Thus  ' father '  said  by  a  son  is  haimq ;  said  by  a   daughter,  is  Jiah-ta.                  ' Son,

                                                                                                      _

said by a father, is keet ; said by a mother, is kin. Evidently at some period the

mothers were captives of a different tribe. It would be difficult to produce on the

globe a more conspicuous example of the beneficent effect of missionary influence,
combinino industrial with religious instruction, than has been presented by the

Tsmipsheean Indians at Metla Katla, under Mr. Duncan, a layman commissioned

by the Church Missionary Society.
     I must now call vour attention to the remarkable explorations, little known

in this country, of "I'Abbe Petitot, also a lay missionary (frere oblat) of the

Roman Catholic Church, in the Mackenzie River district, between Great Slave
Lake and the Arctic Sea, a region which that Church has almost made its own.

Starting sometimes from St. Joseph's mission station, near Fort Resolution, on
Great Slave Lake, sometimes from S. Theresa, on Great Bear Lake, sometimes

from Notre Dame de Bonne Esp^rance on the Mackenzie, points many hundreds of

miles asunder, he has on foot or in canoe, often accompanied only by Indians or

Esquimaux, again and again tra^-ersed that desolate country in every direction.

He has passed four winters and a summer on Great Bear Lake, and explored
every part of it. He has navigated the Mackenzie ten times between Great Slave

Lake and Fort Good Hope, and eight times between the latter post and its mouth.

We owe to his visits in 1870 the disentanglement of a confusion which existed

between the mouth of the Peel River (R. Plum^e) and those of the Mackenzie,
owing to their uniting in one delta, the explanation of the so-called Esquimaux
Lake, which, as Richardson conjectured, has no existence, and the delineation of
the course of three large rivers which fall into the Polar Sea in that neighbour-
hood, the ' Anderson,' discovered by Mr. Macfarlane, in 1859, a river named by
himself the Macfarlane, and another he has caUed the Ronciere. Sir John
Richardson was aware of the existence of the second of these, and erroneously

    ' The words, read by Archdeacon Hunter, are ' oomah reaskemow pache oonahne
aetabmoo,' and their purport is a direction. ' This road, come, oonahne flee thou.'

 supposed it to be the ' Toothless Fish ' River of the Hare Indiaus (Beg-hui-la on
 his map.) M. Petitot has also traced and sketched in several lakes and chains of
 lakes, which support his opinion that this region is partaking of that operation of

elevation which extends to Hudson's Bay. He found the wild granite basin of

 one of these dried up, and discovered in it, yawning and terrible, the huo'e funnelled
opening by which the waters had been drawn into one of the many subterranean
 channels which the Indians believe to exist here.

       These geogi-aphical discoveries are but a small part of I'Abbe Petitot's ser^dces.
 His intimate knowledge of the languages of the Northern Indians has enabled him
 to rectify the names given by previous travellers, and to interpret those descriptive

appellations of the natives, which are often so full of significance. He has pro-

 foundly studied their ethnology and tribal relations, and he has added greatly to
 our knowledge of the geology of this region.

     It is, however, much to be regretted that this excellent traveller was provided
with no instruments except a pocket watch and a compass, which latter is a
somewhat fallacious guide in a region where the declination varies between 35°
and 58°. His method has been to work in the details brought within his personal

knowledge, or well attested by native information, on the basis of Franklin's

 charts.

   --M. Petitot expresses his persuasion that the disti-ict of Mackenzie river can never

be colonized a conclusion no one, who has visited it, will be disposed to dispute
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

but he omits to point out that the mouth of that river is about 700 miles nearer
the port of Victoria, in British Columbia, than the mouth of the Lena is to Yoko-
hama, and far more accessible. It needs no Nordeuskjcild to show the way. Its
upper waters, the Liard, Peace, Elk, and Athabasca rivers, drain an enormous
extent of fertile country, not without coal or lignite, and with petroleum in abun-
dance. As the geological survey has not yet been extended so far, we are not

fuUy acquainted with its mineral resources ; but I can add my testimony to that of

more recent travellers, as to the remarlcable apparent fertihty, and the exceptional
climate of the Peace River valley. It is no extravagant dream that sees in a dis-
tant future the beneficent influence of commerce, reaching by this great natural
channel, races of mankind in a high degree susceptible to them, and alleviating
what appears to us to be the misery of their lot.

     There are few subjects of greater physical interest, or which have received

less investigation, than the extent to which the soil of our planet is now per-

manently frozen round the North Pole. Erman, on tlieoretical grounds, affirms
that the ground at Yakutsk is frozen to a depth of 630 feet. At 50 feet be-
low the surface it had a temperature of 28°*6 F. (-6° R.), and was barely up
to the freezing point at 382 feet. It is very different on the American

continent. The rare opportunity was afforded me by a landslip on a large
scale, in May 1844, of observing- its entire thickness, near Fort Norman, on

Mackenzie river, about 200 miles further north than Yakutsk, and it was only
45 feet. At York Factory and Hudson's Bay it is said to be about 23 feet. Tlie
recent extension of settlement in Manitoba has led to wells being sunk in manv
directions, establisliing the fact that the permanently frozen stratum does no't
extend so far as that region, notwithstanding an opinion to t!ie contrary of the late
Sir George Simpson. Probably it does not cross Churchill river, for I was assured
that there is none at Lake a la Crosse. It depends, in some measure, on exposure.
In the neighbourhood of high river banks, radiating their heat in two directions,
and in situations not reached by the sun, the frost runs much deeper than in the
open. The question, however, to which Sir John Richardson called attention so

long ago as 1839, is well deserving of systematic inquiry, and may even throw

some light on the profoundly interesting subject of a geographical change in the

position of the earth's axis of rotation.

     The Saskatchawan was first navigated by steam in 1875, when a vessel of
about 200 tons ascended from the Grand Rapid to Edmonton, 700 miles. There
is, however, an obstacle at Cole's Falls, below Carlton House, which has led to a
break of navigation, and a small steel steamer, originally intended for the Upper
Athabasca, has recently been transferred to the Upper Saskatchawan ; between
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                            651

the two, it is now navigated from the Grand Rapids, near Lake Winnipeg, to the
Abase of the Rocky Mountains.
                               steamer also plies regularly on Lake Winnipeg,

and has ascertained many interesting particulars, of which we have hitherto been

ionorant. Its greatest depth does not apparently exceed 100 feet. Its discharge

has at last been followed by Dr. Robert Bell, down the Nelson river, to the sea.
That gentleman reports the impediments to navigation to be insuperable, and a

company has been very recently formed to make a railway from the lowest navi-

gable point to the mouth of the Churchill river.

Our hopes of further light upon the history of the ill-fated Franklin

expedition, based on information gi\en by a Netchelli Esquimaux, to the

American Captain Potter in 1872, have been again disappointed. An American

search expedition lauded at Depot Island (lat. 04°), in the neighbourhood of which

traces were reported, in August 1878, wintered there, and examined the country,

as yet with no result, except a correction of the charts.

    Hudson's Bay itself cannot fail at no distant day to challenge more attention.

Dr. Bell reports that the land is rising at the rate of 5 to 10 feet in a century, that

is, possibly, an inch a year. Not, however, on this account will the hydrographer

notice it ; but because the natural seaports of that vast interior now thrown open

to settlement, Keewatin, Manitoba, and other provinces unborn, must be sought

there. York Factory, which is nearer liverpool than New York, has been

happily called bv Prof. H. Y. Hind, the Archangel of the West. The mouth of

the Churchill, however, although somewhat fui-ther north, offers far superior

natural advantages, and may more fitly challenge the title. It will undoubtedly be

the future shipping port for the agricultural products of the vast north-west

territory, and the route by which emigrants will enter the country.
     Before leaving this quarter I must allude to the praiseworthy efforts of some of

the Western States, especially Nebraska and Minnesota, to encourage the planting
on the great plains by premiums, in which they have been followed by our own

Province of Manitoba. Many years must elapse before the full climatic effects

can be realized, but in time they cannot be doubtful, and with the impending

disappearance of the buffalo will disappear much of that arid treeless region,

embracing nearly 600,000 square miles, which he now wanders over, and assists to

keep bare" by so doing. On the other hand, the short-sighted and destructive habit

of burning off the prairie grasses to promote a young growth, increases with settle-

ment, and is chargeable with incredible mischief. These tires have the curious

effect, when they extend into wooded regions, of helping to exterminate the more

slow-growing and valuable descriptions of timber, and favouring the prevalence of

the more worthless quick-growing kinds. But the Indians are even more charge-

able with them than the whites, and the traveller encounters few more melancholy

sights than a forest of charred and lifeless trunks extending over an area as large

as a county, the fruit perhaps of a signal from one band to another.

   A discourse on American geography would be incomplete without reference to

that great design of piercing the Isthmus of Panama, with which Count Ferdinand

de Lesseps has connected his name. Out of the conflict of about ten competing
lines, the oldest and the youngest alone survive. The route by Lake Nicaragua

appeared possible even to Cortez. It was accurately surveyed nearly seventy years
ago, and the estimates, although they have grown alarmingly, are still within
practicable limits. It has the preference of the highest authorities in the United

States. Its total length would be 180 miles, including 56 miles of lake navigation,

with a summit level, to be attained by lockage, of 107'0 feet.
     The Panama route would shorten the canal to one-fourth of this length, and it is

a cardinal point with its author to dispense altoerether with locks. As we expect

--to be favoured by the presence of Lieut. Bonaparte Wyse M. de Lesseps' coadjutor

--I need say no 'more, except that the enthusiastic reception given to M. de Lesseps

here in Swansea, not many weeks ago, is sure evidence that this great industrial
centre takes a keen interest in his project from a commercial point of view ; and we

the vast benefit it already owes, in another quarter, to his genius and indomitaUe

perseverance.

One of the most interesting questions in the whole range of geography still

awaits positive proof or disproof in this region. I refer to the often asserted

existence of a native race in Central America which holds no communication with

Europeans, and preserves its ancient language, religion, and civilisation unchanged

from the time of the Spanish ("onquest. Antecedently so improbable as to be well-

nigh incredible, it found credit with Mr. Stephens and Mr. Catherwood and Mr.

ANorman.       later traveller. Captain Carmichael, expressed, at this Association in

1870, his firm belief in it ; and 1 will, with your permission, read an extract from

a letter dated January last, which I received from that enthusiastic explorer. Dr.

Le Plongeon, who has been for several years engaged in investigating the ruins of

Central America.

     ' I have been told that there are many tribes in the interior of the country that
have had but little contact with the Spaniards, and therefore have retained the

--purity of their language. This causes me to tell you here that the report which

many think hypothetical, of a vast extent of country, some assert 500 miles,

comprised between Tabasco, Gualtimala, Peten, and Yucatan, very mountainous,

well-nigh inaccessible, that is inhabited by the remnants of various warlike tribes,

the Chinamaces, the Laucaerones, the Itzaks, and others, who flying before the

Spaniards, have fortified themselves in very rich valleys, where they live to the

--present day as their fathers, at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, and speak

the pure unadulterated Maya is not far irom being true. I have inquired from
parties who have lived in the neighbourhood of the Tierra de la Guerra, as they

call it, and learn that people coming from the unknown regions are sometimes seen

in the villages of the neighbourhood, where they barter tobacco, cocoa, and other

products of their industry, for whatever they want ; that of late some came to
hire on the farm as labourers, but will not "allow any white to penetrate their

stronghold.'

     Tierra de la Guerra is an old designation for the region in which the boundaries
of Honduras, Yucatan, and Guatemala meet, and wliich contains some twenty-five
or thirty thousand square miles, an area quite extensive enough for small aboriginal
communities to be hidden away in it; and, if as Dr. Le Plongeon thinks, the
long-sought key to the Mexican hieroglyphics should be preserved among them,

there is a brilliant reward for the first scientiKc traveller who, without shedding

Weblood, can penetrate into their fastnesses.                                                                shall, 1 trust, hear more of this

region from a gallant and enterprir^ing traveller, the Colonial Secretary of British

Honduras, who has already penetrated its outskirts, and wants nothing more than

a little aid and encouragement to advance beyond them. In a recent letter to me,
Mr. Fowler saj's :

    ' On the east coast of Y^icatan, not far from the sea-coast, are the ruins of
three cities, and close to our own frontier is a ruin which, the Indians tell me,

contains plenty of mural paintings on the inside walls of the chambers. All these

ruins are under the control of the Santa Cruz Indians. The chiefs of these Indians

lately visited Belize and were shown much attention. I had them particularly

in my charge. They received a Martini-Henry rifle each and we swore mutual
confidence in each other. They invited me to their country, promising me a safe

conduct, and gave me leave to visit any ruin and take awaywhat I liked.'

That such an opportunity should be lost for want of a very moderate sum to

defray the expenses of an expedition would be a matter of regret, which all pre-

sent will share                                                                     and  I  am  not without  hopes that ways and means may be raised,
                                                                                 ;

through the co-operation of those who are intei'ested in the subject from an

historical, as well as a geographical point of view, to enable Mr. Fowler to carry

out his project.

Mr. Edward Whymper, whose recent mountain ascents in Ecuador have roused

the interest of geographers and Alpine climbers in so high a degree, and whose

presence to-day we had some reason to expect, is detained at Guayaquil. Fortune
has favoured him to the last. He made a second ascent of Chimborazo in July,

and after passing the night at an elevation of 15,000 feet, reached the summit ia

time to -witness a magnificent outburst of Cotopaxi, 60 miles distant. The hot
ashes were wafted to Ohimborazo in such quantities as to cover the snow around

him, and to produce an etfect which he compares to the appearance of a newly-

ploughed field.

    It appears probable that we shall owe to America the solution of a question

which, even within the limited area of these islands, often occupies oiu: Courts of

WeLaw, and troubles us in daily life. I mean a definition of civil time.                          have

an extreme difference of time between Yarmouth and Valentia of about 48i

minutes ; but the merchant at San Francisco finds himself 3j hours behind his

correspondent in New York, and the consequence has been an irregular acknow-

ledgment of no less than seventy-five local standards of time on different railways

in the United States. These it is now proposed to reduce to five, of exactly one

hour interval, which would equally suit the Dominion of Canada. Mr. Sanford

Fleming, late Engineer-in-Chief of the Canada Pacific Railroad, advocates the

still bolder measure of adopting the meridian of 180°, as a meridian for railway

and telegraph time all over the woi-ld. It is not unworthy of this Section to aid

in the preparation of the public mind for the legal adoption of prime meridians in

this country at about ten-minute intervals. Thus Greenwich time might ride

from Yarmouth to Winchester ; Bath time from Winchester to Exeter, and so on

the first step towards which will be substituting meridians at 1^° interval, corre-

sponding to five minutes of time, for the unmeaning lines at 1° or 5° of angle,

which are drawn on school maps at present.

I shall, perhaps, be accused of poaching on the manor of a brother President, if

I venture to allude to another subject which belongs rather to the Geological

Section. But a railway guide is surely a geographical manual, and in the American

Geological Railway Guide of Mr. Macfarlane, we have a model and example of

what may be done to disseminate knowledge, which I think worthy of passing

notice. This work tells the traveller, and the resident no less, the chief geological

characteristics of the neighbourhood of every railway station in the United States.

Is it extravagant to suppose that the same information, with the addition of the

name of the county, the height above the sea, the prevailing industry, the popula-

tion, the rainfall, the climate, and other constants, may be some day furnished by

    Turning now from a quarter on which I fear I hare nearly exhausted your

--patience from the West to the East. It is now nearly forty years since the corps

of Royal Engineers was first associated in the exploration of Palestine by the
employment of Captain Symonds, R.E., to determine the depression of the Dead
Sea. The recent completion of the great map of that country is a performance
whose luu'ivalled Biblical and topographical importance should not blind us to its
geographical interest. The first surveyed of all known lauds, it is also the last.

                               Siloa's brook that flowed

                               Fast by the oracles of God

is traced again, and the surprising local accuracy of the sacred writers established

upon testimony beyond dispute.

The British survey, as j'ou are aware, has been limited to the country west of

the Jordan, an American Association having charged itself with the survey east of

that stream.  This  is   not  yet  published                                                 but  I trust that we shall have Irom Mr.

     Operations of war have been in all ages fruitful of geographical knowledge.

Many an old soldier of Alexander, we may be sure, was cross-examined by
Eratosthenes ; many a centurion of Hadrian related his weary marches in Gaul or

Britain to Ptolemy, before those ancient geographers acquired the imperfect know-
ledge which served the world for so many centuries. The first legion that crossed
the Alps accomplished a feat as arduous as the passage of Shutargardan or the

Balkans, but it left us no record. To our own and the Russian Topographical
Staff in Central Asia we owe, on the contrary, a series of explorations conducted

under every difficulty, which must vastly facilitate the access of commerce to those

distracted regions. Referring here to the former alone, they may be divided into

three groups :
      1. Southern Afghanistan, embracing Quetta and Candahar.

    2. The Kurram valley and generally the south of the Safaid Koh range.
    3. The north of the Safaid Koh range, including the valley of the Elabul river

and that city itself

    In the tirst of these an entirely new route through the villages of Tal and
Chotiali, crossing several mountain passes, was followed by Major-General Sir M.
Biddulph's column, and surveyed by Captain T. II. Holdich. Much new country
was also surveyed by Lieutenant-Colonel W. M. Campbell between Pishin and the

Afo-han desert. This officer thrice crossed the table-land of Toba, and by means

of the field electric telegi-aph, lias determined the- difference of longitude between

Quetta and Candahar.

    On the south of the Safaid Koh range we have at,least 3000 square miles sur-

veyed by Major R. G. Woodthorpe, embracing the Shutargardan pass and the
range which divides the Kurram from the Khost valley. This officer, accompanied

by Captain Martin, ascended in 1878 the highest peak on the Safaid Koh range

(Sikaram, 15,622 feet), but unfortunately was disappointed of observations, by the
hot-weather haze, which enveloped the peaks of the Hindu-Kush. Mr. G. B.

Scott, a civilian surveyor, was more successful, and obtained observations to all of

them.          ·

On the north of the Safaid Koh range over 2200 square miles of new country

were surveyed in 1878-9. The Shinwaries and Khagianis have, however, an

insuperable aversion to plane tables and theodolites, and it was in no spirit of kind-

ness that they gained for the gallant Captain E. P. Leach, R.E., his Victoria

Cross. Less has been learnt about their countiy than could be wished. I am not

over-stating the services of our Topographical Staff in Afghanistan in estimating

the aggregate of ground covered by their surveys or sketches at 140,000 square

miles, and we have, through Major Tanner, got a little information respecting the

almost unknown land of Kafiristan, lying to the north of Jallalabad. Disguised as

a Kabuli, this gallant officer entrusted himself to a friendly Chugani chief, and

penetrated some distance into that rugged country. He says of the principal

village that the houses are piled one above another, and every beam, doorway, and

shutter carved in a most elaborate manner. The designs, he adds, are crude, but

such a mass of carving he had never seen before. The taste reminds us curiously

of that of the mountaineers of Switzerland and the Tyrol. I regret that the limits

of an address do not permit justice to be done to the services of these gallant

officers.

     In Zululaud about 9000 square miles of country have been triangidated, and
the details tilled in, to some extent, at our Intelligence Department, from the
numerous sketches of the staff; no such systematic survej' was, however, attempted

--in this quarter as in Asia a fact to be regretted, when we remember the excellent

opportunity which the military occupation of a coimtry affords for combined

explorations.

    In Central Africa we have tlie information given to Commander Cameron by

his native guides, in 1874, that a river they called the Lukuga, which he descended
four or five miles, is the outlet of Lake Tanganyika, confirmed and placed beyond

dispute by the Rev. E. C. Hore, of the London Missionary Society, who entered it in
April, 1879, found it free from the obstructions which an-ested Cameron, and was

able to go further down. Since which time, and quite recently, its course has
been followed by Mr. Joseph Thomson, almost to its junction with the Lualaba.
The discovery is of extreme interest from every point of view, especially as pointing
to the probable line of future communication of the regions bordering that great

inland sea, with the Atlantic,, although the river itself, at least after the rainy

expeditions on record. The most youthful of African travellers, for he is onlj^ 22

down for his late lamented chief, Mr. Keith Johnston ; has done it admirably

melancholy fate which has since befallen Captain Carter, whose genial welcome at

Ivarema he records.

    Time does not permit me to follow all the phases of that new-born activity

which is establishing centres of exploration and of civilisation at every great lake
in Africa. The Belgian Expedition, conducted by Mr. Stanley, and the Baptist
Missionary Expedition from San Salvador or Congo, are still aiming at the same
point, viz., to reach Stanley Pool, above the falls, on the river Congo, the first by

ascending the river, the latter by overland route, by way of Makuta or Zombo.
The latter have met with great opposition at Makuta, and by the last account had

not got within 100 miles of the Pool. That munificent benefactor of African

missions, Mr. Robert Arthington, of Leeds, has paid a sum of 4000^. to the Baptist

Society with a view to placing a small steamer on the river as soon as practicable,

of establishing stations on the Ikelemba and M'bura rivers, and of opening com-r

munication by the latter with Lake Albert Nyanza. Much of this country is

entirely unexplored.

     The road from Dar-es-Salaam on the east coast to Lake Nyassa, about 350 miles,
has beeu completed through the coast jungle. Mr. Beardall, the chief engineer, has
located the first section of about 100 miles to the valley of the Rufigi, and proposes
to make use of the tributary river Uranga as far as navigable, up stream, towards
the mountains which border the lake, before resuming his road-making. The
highways of Central Africa, whether by land or water, exist as yet only in the
hopes of philanthropists and the dreams of commerce, and I fear we must include
among the visions, that artificial sea which some geographers have proposed to
make by conducting the waters of the Atlantic or the Mediterranean into depres-
sions known to exist in the great Sahara. The subject has been examined by the
Chevalier Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg, an Austrian traveller, who is prevented by
illness from joining our meeting and giving us a communication on the subject.

Meanwhile, it appears to be tolerably well established that wells can be sunk
almost anywhere, each becoming a centre of vegetation and productiveness.

2. Through Siberia, via the Amur and the Ussuri,
        By the Rev. Henry Lansdell, F.B.G.S.

This paper described a journey (undel-taken with the object of visiting prisons,

hospitals, and charitable institutions, which were found to be in a much better

condition than is generally supposed) through Siberia, from the Urals to the

Pacific, by a route largely new : namely, from Ekateriueburg to Tobolsk by horses

thence by steamer on the Irtish and Obi to Tomsk : again by horses to Barnaul,

Irkutsk, Kiakhta (steaming across Lake Baikal), across the Trans-Baikal province

to the Sbilka: then by steamer to the Amur : down its entire length to Nikolaefsk;

and subsequently returning southwards, by the Ussuri, Sungacha, and Sooifoon to

Vladivostock.

On reaching the Obi, on the 62nd parallel, the author found on June 8th compara-

tive winter, or leafless spring ; the thermometer falling at night to 35°, but risino- to

75° Fahr. by nine a.m. Fine weather set in a week afterwards and continued all across

Asia. Here live ducks were offered by the Ostjaks for five farthings each, large

fish called yrtss for Hd. a pair, and pike for a farthing each. Milk cost 2^d. a

bottle, but young calves in remote villages could be piu'chased for sixpence each.

The belt of rich black earth in the region immediately north of the Altai lets for
3^d. per acre, and from it wheat may be purchased for about one-twentieth its

cost in England. Still further north, in the forest region, rich in excellent timber

and fur-bearing animals, meat was bought up wholesale in 1877 at less than a

halfpenny per English pound ; whilst in the most northerly region, that of the

tundras, the rivers are so full of fish that one of the ordinary difficulties of the

natives is to avoid breaking their nets with the weight of the draught. The fish

thus caught are, in the winter, frozen and sent more than 2000 miles, to St.

Petersburg, where a very moderate price realizes for the fisherman a profit of

nearly a hundred per cent. These prices should be borne in mind in connection

with the proposed trade between Siberia and England by the rivers Obi and

Yenesei, and through the Kara Sea.

Mr. Lansdell reached Tomsk on the 10th June, having accomplished a journey

of 5200 miles  in  26 travelling  days                          and  then  made  a  detour  of 600  miles to
                                                             ;

Barnaul, through a singularly rich and productive country. Irkutsk was reached

after a posting journey of 1040 miles, on the 6th July. After crossing Lake

Baikal, and making a detour to the Chinese frontier at Kiakhta, the hilly steppes

of the Trans-Baikal province were crossed through Chita and Nertchinsk to

Stretinsk, In the neighbourhood of Nertchinsk are the mines in which prisoners

are popularly supposed to be killed by inches, living amid quicksilver fumes.

Inquiry into this matter failed to convince the author that there is a quick-

silver mine in Siberia, and when he inquired of released prisoners who had worked

in the mines concerning such alleged enormities as keeping them under grormd

entirely, they distinctly denied the truth of such charges. The author himself

visited the convict gold-mines at Kara, 70 miles down the Shilka from Stretinsk.

Kara is a penal colony with upwards of 2000 convicts (including a few for

political offences), condemned to hard labour in the gold mines. The labour is done

on the surface and consists in digging earth and carting it away to be washed.

The hours of convict labour, however, are shorter than those of free labourers in

the same mines ; and in the winter, the ground being frozen, the prisoners have

little or nothing to do. Their weekly allowance of food weighs nearly double that

given to English convicts, and after a certain time they are allowed to live with

their wives and families before being settled as colonists.

The scenery of the Shilka compares by no means unfavourably with the Ehine.

which flows into the right bank of the Amur at Khabarofka, 112.] miles from
Ust Strelka. I'^rom Khabarofka, Mr. Lansdell descended the Amur 000 miles to
Nikolaefsk. The river now widened in some places to three miles in a siuMe
channel, and where islands intervened its greatest breadth was as much as twefve
miles. On the third day fri)m Khabarofka the traveller reached Michailofsky

situated in the district whence is produced the corn of the lower Amur (which
amounted in 1878 to 3270 tons, besides 811 tons of potatoes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     '

On the last day's travel, Mr. Lansdell saw at Tuir some Tatar monuments with
Sanscrit words written iu Chinese, Niguriau, and Thibetan. It is said to be the

site of an ancient Lama monastery. The characters on the principal stone reminded

the observer of a palimpsest manuscript of which only the upper characters had
been deciphered.

The author reached Nikolaefsk on the 13th, and staved to the 30th Au"-ust

then returning to Khabarofka. This gave him ampler opportunity of seeiu'? the'

natives-- especially the Gilyaks and Goldi. The Gilvaks inhabit the lower^part

of the river, are small in stature, and live almost entirely on tish. They have
little notion of a Supreme Beiug, aiid are ccmmonlv sail to worship the bear

On the 4th September, the traveller came the second time to Khabarofka
whence he proceeded up the Ussuri. This river is nearly two miles wide at its'
junction with the Amur. In ascending, the right bank is Chinese territory, the
left Ru.s.siau. The Chinese bank is for the most part Hal : but the horizon is
bounded by low mountain peaks. The left, or Russian bank, is mountainous and
wooded. Sometimes the mountains retire, leaving a rich bottom land of Eno-lisk

park-like scenery. The habitations passed on the Ussuri were few and far between.
Most of the Russian d^^·ellings consisted of Cossack sfmii/zas and pickets, placed
there to guard the frontier. The Ussuri is navigable several miles beyond Busse,
and could a railway be made from A'ladivostock to its most southern naviirable
point It would be of the greatest importance to the fertile lands of the lower sea-
coast province. The total length of the Ussuri is 407 miles. The upper part of
the stream is rapid, aud below the confluence of the Sungacha also it is swift · but
towards the mouth it has a current of two knots onlv.

game and also with tigers. On the evening of the second day the traveller arrived
at Lake Khanka. There were two Chinese houses, of which not a dozen had been seen
all along the Ussuri ; thirty-six Russian stations in all were passed. Lake Khanka is

65 miles long, and from 21 to 26 miles wide. Its shores, with the exception of
the south and south-east, are wooded, hut not mountainous. After steaming across

it during the night and arriving at Kamen-ruibaloiF at dawn on September the 11th,

Mr. Lansdell had to drive nearly 100 miles in the roughest of conveyances to the
river Sooifoon, through a country singularly fertile, but almost uninhabited. The
journey was accomplished by the evening of the second day, and on reaching
Rasdolnoi there was found a small steamer to carry him 30 miles on the Sooifoon

--to the Amur Bay ; where he was transhipped to a larger steamer, which brought

him to Vladivostock thus finishing his journey from London of 11,555 miles.

     After referring to the great variety and immense value of the products of these
islands to our markets, and the corresponding benefit to the natives likely to accrue
from the establishment of English trade, Mr. Powell remarked that they were
very anxious to obtain the articles dispensed by English traders, and to have

traders li-ving with them. He then gave a slight sketch of the first discoverers and
geographical position of New Britain (situate between the eastern extremity of New

Guinea and the Solomon Islands), which has a coast line of nearly 400 miles, from
Spacious Bay on the east to the island of Willaumez on the west. The natives

were at one time apparently identical all o-ver the island, though now varying in
different parts of it. They are subject to a disea.se called 'J3uckwar'; bigamy
exists among them, and they purclia.se their wives; their money ( 'Dewana') con-

method of making stone-clubs, and their different methods of making war, which
are marked by great treachei v, and accompanied by decided acts of cannibalism
also their civil rider (' Dook i)ook '), and his rights of succession and manner of

Bay district. These remarks were illustrated by pliotographs of the natives and
their dAvelliiigs, taken hy the author, and by specimens of native manufactures,
weapons, &:c., collected hy him.

     The country about Port More-sby was described as poor and barren, though
possessing many features of natural beauty. The natives present a great diversity
of race and habits, speaking twenty-five different dialects in an area of 300 miles.
Their houses are built on piles, and the stone age stUl prevails with them. Their
moral condition is low ; but the author spoke in high terms of the kindness and

hospitality experienced at their hands.

     The resources of the district are as yet undeveloped, and at present no commerce
is carried on Avith the people. The climate has proved unhealthy to Europeans,

and will interfere seriously with any attempt at colonisation.
     The author concluded with an appeal, in tlie interests of religion, science, and

commerce, to preserve peaceful relations with the aborigines.

      This paper contained notes of a journey undertaken during the spring of last
year through the provinces of Jaulau, Ajlun, and Belka, to the east of the Jordan.
Crossing the Jordan at its source, Mr. Oliphant struck south-east from Bamai,

visiting the new Circassian colonj^ of Kuneitereh. Then crossing the fertile pasture-

lands of Jaulan, the ancient Gaiilanitis, or Jolan of the Scriptures, he kept along the

eastern base of the Jebel Hesh range, ascending Tel-el-Teras, its most southerly peak.
Thence in an easterly direction to Sheikh Sa'ad, where the fountain and sacred stone
of Job are resorted to, more especially by negro pilgrims from Soudan and other parts
of Africa, and form 'holy places,' much venerated in the neighbourhood. Thence to
Tel-Asherah, which the author thinks he has satisfactorily identified as the site of
Ashtaroth Karnaim, and thence by way of Mesarib to Irbid (Arbela), and Beit-er-
Ras, the ancient Capitolias, at both of which places are interesting remains of archi-
tecture of the Greek and Roman type, common to this part of the country, in the
first and second centuries after Christ, and where the stone houses of the Jefnide
and Ghassanide Arabs still remain to testify to their superior civilisation. Both
at Tel-Asherah and Irbid, however, the sub-structure bears marks of an antiquity
anterior to the Christian era. From Capitolias the south bank of the Yarmuk
was followed to Gadara, the extensive ruins of which are too well-known to need
description. Thence in a south-easterly direction into the forest-clad mountains

easterly to Jerasli. Thence to Salt, and from Salt in a due easterly direction to the
interesting and little known ruins of Yajuz ; thence to Kalat Terka, a station on
the Hadj road from Damascus to Mecca, and probably the site of the ancient

Gadda. Thence south-west to Rabboth Amman and back to Salt. From Salt he

also visited the interesting ruin of Arak-el-Emir, the fortress of Hyrcanus. The
whole country traversed, was, excepting in its eastern sections, either pasture,
wooded, or arable land, and capable in the highest degree of development ; while
there can be no doubt that in the unexplored mountainous region traversed bv the
Upper Yabbok ruins remain yet to be discovered, and sites to be identified, which
will contribute for some years to come to make the whole of this country, already
so replete with historical association, a most interesting field of research.

4. Notes on a Journcij from Canton to Ktvei-Yang-Fu up the Canton River.

                                     By W. Mesny.

    Mr. Mesuy, a gentleman from Jersey, who has passed many years in the interior of
China in the service of the Chinese Government, and who accompanied Captain Gill
from Ch'eng-Tu to Bhamo duiing his journey across China to Burma, has commu-

nicated through that officer particulars of his voyage up the Hsi-IIo or (,'anton

river to Kwei-Yang-Fu in the province of Kwei-Cliou, not before made by any

European.

     Mr. Mesny started from Canton on March 9, 1870, in a native junk, ascending

the west river past Fu-Shan (the ' Fat-Shan' of W. & A. K. Johnston's map), and

entering the main Hsi-ITo (Si-Kiang of Johnston) at San-Shui-IIsien. Here tho

river is 200 yards wide, and deep enough for steamers of  1000 tons                                        its  banks are
                                                                                                        ;

fertile and well-cultivated. After passing Shao-Shing-Fu (Chow-King), the frontier

of Kuang-Si was reached at Wu-Chou-Fu (Oo-Chow), on the junction of the Fu-Ho

and Hsi-IIo. This city is the centre of a considerable import and export trade, and

is visited for commercial purposes by the aboriginal Miau-Tze from Kwei-Chou,

with strange costumes and incomprehensible tongue, who are looked on with con-

tempt by the people of the great central nation. Even now there are here stores

for foreign goods which have managed to pass the Lekin or octroi barriers so nume-

rous between Canton and Wu-Ohou-Fu. These barriers afford little benefit to the

revenue, being used by greedy officials as a means of extortion ; and they cripple

trade by increasing the cost of articles in proportion to the distance of carriage.

Wu-Chou-Fu may, however, yet become a good treaty port for Kuang-Si, Kwei-

Ohou,and some parts of IIu-Nan and Yiin-Nan, as light-draught steamers for towing

purposes could come up with cargoes all the year round. Mr. Mesny met with civil

treatment from the people, though the magistrate endeavoured to keep him away by

attempting to excite his fears.

After a journey of twenty-one days up the Fu-TIo (Kwei-Fong or Cassia), the

traveller reached Kwei-Lin-Fu (Kuei-Ling), the provincial capital of Kuang-Si, on

June 23. This river i.s not likely to be used for steam traffic, owing to its shallow

rapids. The cities on it are ruinous, and occupied chiefly by new-comers. Rice

and other cereals, and sugar cane, are much cultivated, and the country above Ping-

Lo-Fu is very picturesque, the hiUs sometimes having large caves which pierce

them, showing the sky through. The people are greater flesh-eaters than those

of other provinces, and the women do not as a rule cramp their feet.

After a stay of a week, Mr. Mesny reached the Pei-Sha-Kiang, having crossed

a plateau by water with an ascent of eight and descent of fifteen locks. There a

large irrigating wheel, lifting water 30 feet above the river level into troughs, was
seen. On the third day from Kwei-Lin-Fu the main west river (Hsi-Ho) was again

struck, near Liu-Ohou-Fu (Lioo-Chow), now very quiet and partly in ruins. The
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  661

vidth, depth, and slight current of the river appear to favour steam navigation, and

thougli the branch starting near Yiin-Nan-Fu is much the longer, this one is con-
sidered the principal by the Chinese, who give the preference to the one having the
greater number of junks. Trade therefore was probably more prosperous here in

former days. Ascending the river to Liu-Cheng-IIsien (Lioo-Chin), where it again

forks east and west, the traveller chose the Yung-Ho or eastern branch, reaching
Yung-Hsien on the fifth day from Liu-Chou-Fu. This is a flourishing city, and
would make a first-rate terminus for steam navigation from IIong-Koug. Still
ascending the Yung river, the shallows and rapids of which began to obstruct
navigation, Ku-Chou-Ting, an important frontier city of Kwei-Ohou, was reached

in ten days, the country traversed being entirely inhabited by a peculiar tribe of
Miau-Tze" called Tuug-Kia, subsisting principally on a very glutinous kind of rice
called No-Mi, and li\ing in two-storeyed houses, of which the lower storey is occu-

pied by cattle, and the upper is almost destitute of furniture.
     At Ku-Chou-Ting, the smallest boats obtainable had to be used, and iu eight

days the head of all navigation was reached at San-Kio, or Li-Miao-Chou, as it is

called officially. An overland journey of eight days brought the traveller to Kwei-
Yang-Fu, entirely through the country of the ]\Iiao-Tze, who are gradually being
displaced by Chinese immigrants, who follow the water-way, and drive the natives

further back into the country.

     Mr. Mesny considers that steamers might ascend from IIoug-Kong to Yung-
Hsien in three or four days without going to Canton, and that a railway might be
laid from Yung-Hsien to Kwei-Yang-Fu, via Li-Po-Hsien, Tu-Shan-Ohou, Lo-Hu,

and Tein-Fan-Ohou. This would, in his opinion, be remunerative if the mines of

the province were opened, and the establishment of a trading line in this direction
would also tend to the opening up of the extensive and rich copper mines of Y'iin-
Nan, to which the direct road is by the Hsi-Ho.

     Mr. Mesny gave some interesting details of the habits, customs, and superstitions

of the people amongst whom he travelled, e.ff. Miao-Tze, with a piece of board fixed

with resin to their crowns for a three years' period ; Yao-Shun, with their temples
quite bald ; and Chuug-Kia of two tribes, Lo and Wei, agriculturists, excessively
devoted to whiskey distilled from the glutinous rice No-Mi, and with hard-working
women, whose morals until the birth of their first child iu wedlock are peculiarly

lax, and who sacrifice bulls and dogs to appease the manes of their ancestors.

        5. The Dutch Indian Government Exploring Expedition in Borneo.

                                         By Cakl Bock.

     In June 1879, Mr. Bock was commissioned by the Dutch Indian Government
to explore the east and south parts of Borneo. In the beginning of Julj- he

arrived at Tangarong, the residence of the Sultan of Koti, to whom he at once

made known his plans of exploring the northern and southern parts of Koti,
and of attempting the overland journey to Banjermassin (the latter journey had

been in vain attempted three times).

     The Sultan, after some demur, furnished him with an interpreter for the
Uyak language, and .also put at his disposal a large prau, or canoe. Mr. Bock,
with his twenty-five followers, left Tangarong on August 10, and navigated
the great Mahakkan river up as far as Moeara Kamau.

     The banks of this river are very thinly inhabited, and only by the Malays and
Bugis. The great drought, which visited parts of Borneo and other islands two
years ago, had made terrible havoc in the forest. For miles the trees were killed

--by it, and nothing but their dead trunks was visible a strange sight in the tropics,

where the eye is accustomed to behold an everlasting summer. From Moeara
Kaman he went up the Moeara Klintjow river. The country is here less inha-

bited ; for a whole day, and even more, rowing along the banks of the river, no
hut was visible ; and the only sign that occasionally enlivened the scenery was a

graceful snake-darter or a group of inquisitive monkeys. On the 21st, Longwai,
the largest Dyak village, was reached.
                                                                               --

662 RKPORT-- 1880.

The natives were at first shj- and suspicious ; but after a while Mr. Bock managed

to get on good terms with them. These Dyaks are, like the rest of the other tribes

in Koti, inveterate head-liunters ; but in other respects good and honest people.

The ' head-hunting ' belongs to the Dj'ak religion, and is a custom ('adat ') estab-

lished from ancient times. For this reason the traA'eller who moves amongst such

tribes is in continual danger. The different tribes have often petty wars, and the

attacks are mostly made in the night.

    From Longwai Mr. Bock went further north, in order to find the Orang Poonan

(also called Olo-Ott) or forest people, whom no European had before seen. These

savages, on the very lowest scale of civilisation, are exceedingly shy ; they live in

troops of six to twenty, have no huts nor any fixed dwelling-places, but roam about

the immense forests, and feed upon monkeys, boars, birds, serpents, and wild fruits.

They seem to be provided with strong digestive organs, as they eat with great appe-

tite the thick roasted hide of the wild boars and monkeys {Nasalis larvatus.)

The women are especially light in colour, and both sexes go almost naked.

They have a very scurvy appearance, and are verj' dirty : but the rumour that the

Orang Poonan are furnished with a caudal appendage is entirely false.

Having returned to Tangarong, Mr. Bock prepared for his overland journey

over 700 miles, and left Tangarong with forty-one men and three canoes, being in

every respect well fitted out. The Pangeran (or Prince) Sokmaviro accompanied

the traveller, as well as a Malay interpreter for the Dyak language. The route

was again up the great Mahakkan to Moeara Kaman, where the mosquitoes were

such a plague that the expedition thought of returning. The next village in the

-- --interior was Kotta Bangoen the largest in Koti with more than a thousand

souls. The inhabitants are all Malays f-nd Bugis, wlio carry on a considerable

trade in rattan, gutta pei-cha, wax, and ' saroeng boeroeng ' (edible birds' nests).

It must be remembered that all the Dyak tribes inhabit the tributarj- rivers of the

Mahakkan, to the far inferior of the country. In the neighbourhood of Kotta

Bangoen, as well as at Tangarong and Moeara Kaman, Mr. Bock found traces of

a former Hindoo occupation.

While at Kotta 13angoen, the Sultan and a numerous suite arrived, but ]\Ir,

Bock preferred to continue the journey alone, on account of the many occupations

which an Indian monarch indulges in. In order to study the diflerent wild tribes,

he proceeded through the lalie region. He was fortunate enough to meet the

Triug Dyaks, the only cannibals in Borneo, with whose Jlajah, Sibau Mobang, Mr.

Bock spent a couple of days. This man is a savage of most forbidding appearance,

extremely ugly : he told the traveller, in an easy wajs that the brains and palms

of the hands of men tasted delicious, whereas the shoulder part always had a bitter

taste. After Mr. Bock had drawn his portrait, Sibau Mobang presented him, on

his departure, with two human skulls, and with a shield ornamented all over, in a

verj' ingenious way, with human hair. During the time Mr. Bock travelled in Koti,

--Sibau Mobang and his followers killed in one week being out on a head-hunting'
--excursion not less than sixty people.

At Moeara Pahou, the last JIalay village in the interior, Jlr. Bock pgain met

the Sultan and his suite, who had gathered together a number of Dvaks to escort

the expedition through the most dangerous part of his territory. The journey was

continued down the Moeara Pahou river, which close to Moeara Anang becomes

very difficult to navigate. There are many rapids, over which the canoes had to

be dragged bj' means of rattan ropes, the luggage and provisions having to be first

discharged. At iloeara Anang the march through the great forest began, the

most fatiguing and dangerous part of the journey. Here one of the Dyaks was

Amurdered, and attempts were made to poison Mr. Bock and his followers.        path

of the rudest description had first to be constructed by the natives, and, in order to

cross the numerous small rivers and abysses, they had made bamboo bridges. Only

those who have travelled in the tropics can form an idea of these elastic structures,

more fit for an acrobat than an ordinary traveller. After four days' march from

sunrise to sunset, the Benangan river was reached. By this and the Tew6h rivei",

and down the great Barito, Mr. Bock and his party reached Banjermassin on

December 31, two days before the Sultan and suite.

                              1. On the North-East Passage.

                    By Lieutenant George T. Temple, B.N.

     The author sketched briefly the history of the North-East Passage since the

ill-fated expedition of Sir Hugh' WilloiighW, showing how the way was gradually

paved for the brilliant success of Baron Nordenskjold, and recapitulated the
advantages likely to accrue from the establishment of a regular trade between

Europe and Siberia. He then gave an outline of Nordenskj old's Arctic career up

to 1876, and described the voyage of the Ve(/a in some detail. The nature of
the country and the manners and customs of the Tchuktches were also touched
upon, and iSTordenskj old's summary of the immediate practical residts of his enter-
prise was quoted. "Referring to the various attempts which had been made to
follow up the successful voyages of 1875 and 1876, the author mentioned that
several foreign vessels, specially built for the purpose, were actively engaged at
that moment, and that the steamer Nordenshjold was attempting the North-East
Passage in the inverse direction. In connection with this subject, Lieut. Temple
remailved that the sailing directions for the coast of Norway, to which he alluded
at the preceding year's meeting of the British Association at Sheffield, had now-
been published" by the Admiralty, while some of the Norwegian charts were in
com-se of preparation. It was trusted that, in spite of some apparently inevitable
errors, the publication of this work, with the necessary charts, would fill up the
gap which had hitherto existed for British navigators in the new commercial high-
way, and that British seamen would be better able to take their share in the establish-
ment of a regular trade-route between Europe and the mighty ri^ers_ of northern
Asia, by means of which the vast, but hitherto pent-up, wealth of Siberia would
find a natural outlet to the great commercial centres of the civilised world. The
discovery of the North-East' Passage might, altogether, be regarded as the most
completely successful Arctic voyage that had ever been made. The paper con-

cluded with a warm tribute to" the foresight, gallantry, and skiU with which the

enterprise had been conceived and carried out.

     2. On an Examination of the Balearic Idands.
              By Dr. Phen^, F.S.A., F.B.G.S.

     The author gave a general description of the several islands in the group, with

the  meaning of their  appellations and  the  method  of  reachmg  them                         following
                                                                                             ;

with a description of the euei'getic agricultural operations of the rural classes, and

the nature of the soil, and a general view of the aspect of the country in each

island.

     In Minorca there are no guides, and the inhabitants of one end of the island

seem to know nothing of the other, or of anything in it except in their own dis-

tricts. Of the extraordmary remains in Minorca there is absolutely no historic

information ; the masonry iiidicates that they are Cyclopean of the oldest type,
Avhile that of the Nurha'gs of Sardinia, with which many suppose they agree, is
not only in courses, but of wrought or well-trimmed stone. The grand feature of
the latter also is wanting, viz., the spiral staircase or ramp, which is foimd also in
the Brocs of Scotland. The plan of the grandest structure in Minorca is square at

the base, and forms a pyramid of which there is no example in Sardinia.

     There is historic reference to the Nurhags of Sardinia, and even to their builder,

lolaus, but tlie antiquity of the remains in Minorca is lost in the mist of ages, or
referred to the time of the very oldest of the mythological deities, Saturn. The

works of lolaus in Sardinia are described in a way to prevent mistake, and they
664 BEPORT-- 1880.

are found to-day as then described. There are some portions of these Nurhags
which appear of an older date, possibly the same as that of the towers in Minorca,
as they are very rude, and from these lolaus probably designed and improved and
produced the present Nurhage, adding the staircase.

     The remains in Minorca differ altogether from the Nurhags of Sardinia, by
having, as a part of them, stone tables, said to be for sacrifice, and circles of
monoliths, neither of which are found in Sardinia. If they existed previously,
they were probably removed ou the coming of lolaus, and the new-comers intro-
duced their own religion. Another .special class of monuments in Minorca ditlers
altogether from anything in Sardinia. These are vast ships built of stone of an
immense age, as pioved by their masourj'. The monuments themselves, as shown
by photographs, and compared with photographs of the earlier Cyclopean masonry
of Greece and Samothrace, are fomid to be of the very earliest type, assimilating
more to the most ancient circular structures in Etruria than any other remains.

     Dr. Phene then described the architectural beauties of the city of Palma, his
various journeys and researches, the mixture of races on the islands, and quoted
the known classical references to these islands, remarking on the people, and their
ancient and modern customs.

          3. On a recent Examination of the TopocirapTiij of the Troad.
                           By Dr. Phene, F.8.A., F.B.G.S.

     The author stated that during .several successive visits to the Plains of Troy,
his attention had been drawn to the former course of the Scamander from the
remains of irregularities in the surface which indicated a former defence by earth-
works, and also a number of heaps of earth which he concluded indicated Trojan
interments. The latter were on the heights, and the whole occupied the space
between His.sarlik and Balidagh near Buuarhashi. His object in noticing these
was to point out what appeared to him an omission by former explorers, as the
line he indicated would be the natural line of defence of the Trojans, the Scaman-
der forming a formidable frontier defence, which with a comparatively slight
earthwork, to protect the defenders, would have prolonged the siege indefinitely.

    From the heights at the rear of this defence, on which were the tumuli

referred to, every operation of the Greeks could have been observed, and on them
the large body of allies securely encamped, while the land also could have been

tilled in security. Homer applied the term 'epifiwKa^ (fertile-soiled) to Troy, by

which he must have meant the part outside the walls.
     This topography would establish and reconcile all conflicting views, as the site

of Hissarlik would then become the place of the city or mart of Troj- (evidently,
from its geographical position, a place for interchange of commerce, and where
the produce from the Caspian and Black Seas would meet that from Syria

and Egypt), and Balidagh would be the citadel. Homer also applied the term
elpvayvaia (broad-wayed) to Troy, to Mycene, and to Athens; and each of the two

latter places had long, broad, and defended roads to their citadels, the one from
Argos and Tiryus, the other from the Piraeus and Phalerura. That Troy should

be without such ways in face of this appellation given by Homer to it in common
with other cities found to have them, seemed improbable, and such ways were in

 the other cases outside the walls, but; not outside the external bulwarks attached
to the city.

     The small dimensions of the foundations at Balidagh, which are of a verj- care-
ful construction, would be quite sufficient for Priam's Palace and the Scsean towers,
though not for the great city ; and the author attributed their present preser-
vation to the unburnt bricks which formed the superstructure, precisely as in
the case of Mantinea in Arcadia, which Pausanias states was built of such
material, and which city Dr. PheniS made a special journej' to examine, in order to
compare its foundations with those at Balidagh, which, being on the spurs of Mount
Ida, must be the classical site, and, like the temple and palace atEphesus, removed
from the tumult of the commercial city. In support of this, it was pointed out
TRANSACTIONS OF SFXTION E.  665

that all the tumuli outs^ide the natural river-boundaries were hy tradition Greek,
while all those within, of which one end of the line of tumuli was at Balidagh
and the other end at liissarlik, were as distinctly recognised as Trojan. Such
defences as he described on the Scamander were on the old course of that river,

and were the usual defences of that age. Homer describes the Greeks erecting

a breastwork of this sort to protect their fleet, and their making a ditch to supply
the place of the river, aud Herodotus (Book 0, chap. 07) gives a similar descrip-
tion of Persian work at Mycale. If such a work existed it was no doubt an original
defence and not made during the siege, which latter caused the Greek one to be
specially noticed. The position of the Scsean gate as suggested was shown to be

exactly that of the Cyclopean bridge and gate leading from Mycenas to the plain of

Argos on the way to that city, aud the length of the broadways of Athens and

of Mycenaj agreed almost minutely with the distance from Ilissarlik to Balidagh.

      A4. Visit to the Galapagos Islands in H.M.S. ' Triumph,' 1880.

                                   By Captain Markham.

     Captain Markham gives an account of a visit he paid to the Galapagos Islands
on board H.M.S. Triumph, in the beginning of the present year. The Admii-alty
chart, compiled from a rough survey made nearly half a century ago, is not very
accurate, so that it was not safe for a large ironclad like the Triumph to extend the
cruise in the numerous channels between the islands. Her visit was, therefore,
confined to Post Office Bay in Charles Island, and the paper records the observations
that were made during several inland excursions.

     The Galapagos Islands, being 600 miles from any other land, have a peculiar
fauna, and Captain Markham devoted all the time at his command to the collection
of birds, skins, insects, and shells. These specimens have been placed in the hands
of Mr. Salvin, and it is anticipated that they will form an addition to our knowledge

of the natural history of this isolated archipelago.

     Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

          President of the Section-- George Woodyatt Hastings, M.P.

                             THUBSDAY, AUGUST 26.

     The following Reports aud Papers were read :

1. Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of reporting ivhether

     it is important that H.M. Inspectors of Elementary Schools should he

      Specific Subjects of the Code in addition to other matters. See Reports,

   3. Vital and other Statistics applicahle to Musicians. By P. M. Tait,

                                               F.S.S., F.R.G.S., Sfc.
     The memoir commences with a rapid sketch of the origm and history of
music, musicians, and musical instruments. Mahalaleel, the fom-th in descent

from Adam, was the first vocalist, and Tiibal-caiu, fifth Uneal descendant from
Cain, the first instrumentalist. Reference is also made to previous inquiries-
into the mortality of musicians, and notice is taken of a paper by Dr. William
Augustus Guy, F.R.S., read to the Statistical Society in 1859, when actors,

vocalists, and musicians were incidentally brought fur the first time under obser-
vation. The data covered by the present paper are obtained more immediately

fi'om Messrs. Cocks & Co.'s * Dictionary of Musicians ' corrected by the more

elaborate work of Dr. Grove, and other records. The records include 736 persons,

of whom G97 are males, and 39 females, 458 being dead aud 278 alive at the present

time. The data thus comprise an aggregate of 32,025'5 years of life. The
mortality disclosed is apparently considerably more favourable than that which
obtains amongst other classes. There is a table comparing the mortality of musicians
with that which obtains amongst the males of England and Wales, the peerage,
government annuitants, and certain other classes. The deaths amongst musicians
at ages from 15 to 45 are apparently considerably less than those which occm*
amongst any other class of society. There is no sufficient reason to account for this
disparity so vastly in favour of musicians ; and it can ouh' be explained by supposing
that in the Dictionary a number of musicians do not come imder observation at the
earlier ages ; the deaths in fact having happened early, they do not come under
review at all. From ages 46 to 50 the results are still in favour of musicians, and
also from 51 to 55. From 56 to 60 the deaths are very much the same as those
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  667

        obsen-ed to occur amongst tlie wliole population of males in Iviigland and Wales.

      From 61 to G5 tliey are apparently slightly less, and also slightly less from 66 to

        the extremity of lite.
             Confining the observations to the mortality per cent, amongst the deceased lives

       only, the results are considerably in excess of those applicable to the whole 736
       persons. Probably the literal truth lies between the columns indicating the results

        in each case.
            The paper passes on to discuss the influence of heredity in the production of

        musicians, and this is manifest to a very great extent. Thus, in the cases of Bach,
       Beethoven, Bellini, Cherubini, Gounod, Haydn, and others, the influence of heredity

         is apparent.

        A curious circumstance comes out in the extreme paucity of female composers.

       Amongst the number of female singers the great names of Alboni, Catalani, Grisi,
       Lind, Lucca, Nilsson, Patti, Sontag, and Tietjens are included, while only four are
       even indicated as composers. Of these the most remarkable in point of versatility is
      undoubtedly Madame Viardot Garcia, born in Paris in 18:21, but of direct Spanish
       extraction, and sister of the famous Malibran, whose family for a hundred years has

      been musical. And here it may be stated that the ages of living jn-ime donne are

       given in the records with an almost ruthless fidelitj'. But it is not of course

       sought to enlarge on that delicate point.

          An attempt is made to indicate the nationality and race of musicians, by classi-

[ fying the whole number under ditferent nationalities, and also by classifying the

       published musical dictionaries up to the present time. 35 per cent, of the whole
      number of musicians are from Germany ; 15 per cent, from Italy ; 11 per cent, from

     France; 10 per cent, from Austria-Hungary, of whom the great majority are

      German-speaking; and 18 per cent, from Great Britain and Ireland. As to dic-
       tionaries, according to Grove and others, from 30 to 40 have been published up to
       the present time. 38 per cent, are in German, 24 per cent, in French, and 15 per
       cent, in English, while only about 6 per cent, are Italian. The apparent superiority

       of England to Italy and France in the production of musicians and musical dic-
       tionaries is explained. The general conclusion under this particular head is, that
      the ranks of modern musicians have been recruited mainly from the German or

      Teutonic stock, that portion of the Japetic or Indo-European branch of the human

       family whose descendants, according to Pritchard and other authorities, reached

      Europe by way of Turkestan, the Euxine, and the mouths of the Danube; that,
      next to the Germanic, come the Latin races ; and that, finallj-, we have the Celts and

       the Sclaves, each of which race has contributed, though in considerably diminished

       mimbers, its quota to the ranks of musicians.
            The general result of the whole investigation is, that while the tables indicating

       the mortality of musicians are interesting as a guide to information on the subject,

       the facts under observation are too few to justify absolute conclusions as to the

       mortality at the earlier ages, or to enable tlie tables to be used without other aids

      for the computation of financial values applicable to musicians. It is clear, how-
      ever, that musicians in many instances live to a great age. Thus among fiimous de-
      ceased octogenarians wc find the illustrious names of Auber, 87 ; our own Braham,
      82 ; Cherubini, 82 ; and Cramer, 87 ; while Sir George Smart lived to 91 ; Sir John
       Goss having onlj^ recently died at 80. There are about half a dozen living octo-
      genarian musicians of note, chiefly resident in Germany. On the other hand,
      among musicians who died comparatively J'oung we find the names of Beethoven,
     who died at 57 ; Bellini at 34 ; Bizet at 37 ; Chopin at 40 ; Cimorosa at 52 ; Fanny
      Hensel at 41 ; Herold at 42 ; Mendelssohn, 38 : Schubert at 31 ; Schumann at 46
      Thalberg at 59 ; Vincent Wallace at 47 ; and Weber at 46.

         An attempt is made to classify musicians according to the specialty of each. It

      is found that 27 per cent, of the whole number are returned in the records as com-
      posers pure and simple ; 37 per cent, as composers and instrumentalists ; while about
      7 per cent, are vocalists pure and simple.

           The memoir has a very wide range, and a great n^unber of authorities are
     quoted, from the ' Rig Yeda ' downwards.

4. Agricultural Statistics and the Land Question. By Wii. Botly. M.B.A.8.

This paper was a continuation of the Agricultui-al Statistics to the present time,

in a tahular form, strongly advising then- continuance and early publication.

In the second part it gaAe the imports of cereals, cattle, sheep, and swine,

meat, &c. ; then- prices and amount in value

Thirdly, the number of owners of land in Great Britain; also, separately, that of

Ireland, in a table of from one acre up to 100,000 acres, with the respective rentals.

The concluding portion of the paper argued for some considerable alterations

in our Land Laws, supporting this view of the question by extracts from the

opinions of the present and late Lord Gliancellors, as well as other eminent states-

men                          and finally, that to  improve  agriculture  and to bring men  of  greater capital,
                          ;

skm, and enterprise into the business of farming, there must be security of tenure

and compensation for all unexhausted unprovements.

It was shown that in the past year our imports of wheat and various other

cereals, with meat, amounted in the aggregate to 140,000,000 cwts., exclusive of

butter, cheese, eggs, &c., &c.

  3. On Admiralty Monies and Accounts. By Frank P. Fellows, F.S.S.,

                                                         F.8.A.

     This was the continuation of a paper read at the Statistical Society, London,

--' On our National Parliamentary Accounts, &c.'
     In that paper it was shown that ' the average yearly expenditure for ten years
previous to 1869, was 11,587,041/., and for the five years, 1869-70 to 1873-4
(taking the estunates for the last year) was only 0,785,915/., and that " these great
results had been brought about by a variety of means, not the least efficient being
the check our improved accounts have given us over expenditure, or what is still
more unportant, over the final results of expenditure." '

     The latter point the present paper illustrated more in detail.
     In 1861, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire and report upon the
management and control of H.M.'s Dock;\'ards.

   --They examined seventy witnesses, all of whom were, or had been, officials, except

two amongst them. Sir James Graham, who stated as follows: 'It is quite com-

petent to frame a form of accounts, and that the evil would be remedied in six
months. The accounts wiU be imperfect unless every kind of charge a shipowner

would bring to book is carried to account. An account misrepresenting values is
infinitely more dangerous than no account at all. An imperfect accoimt, in my

humble judgment, is mfinitely worse than none.'
     Sir John Pakington before the same Commission said : ' If the accounts were

kept so as to show the exact cost of ships, a competition in economy would be
           -- ::

established between the different Yards, which would be of great benefit to Her

Majesty's service.'

They reported finally

We' regret to state that in our opinion the control and management of the

Dockj-ards is inefficient, and that the inetHciency may be attributed to the following

causes               4. The absence of any means, both now and in times past, of

effectually checking expenditure, from (he want of accurate accounts.'

The paper proceeded

In 1864, in connection with Mr. Seely, the Mem1)er for Lincoln, I undertook a

systematic and detailed examination of the finance and other accounts of Govern-

ment, more especially those of the Admiralty.

The result of these investigations, brought forward from time to time in the

House, clearly showed that up to and after this period to 1868, the evils complained

of by the Royal Commission of 1861 had not been remedied.

    i give a few examples extracted by me from Admiralty accounts, and given by

Mr. Seely at various times in the House, which, I think, clearly prove the evils

still existed.

    From 1862-3 to 1864-5 in one year or two years^where expenditure

overlaps:

        mTen ships cost in repairs, Sfc. (one repair iu each case) one

financial year, or two such years when the expenditure overlaps

the end of one and runs into another year : viz. the Highflyer,

Niger, Malacca, Cruiser, Sparrowhawk, Pearl, Simoom, Lyra,

                                                                          614,394
power would have cost onlj-                                               633,703

        Five others, Salamander, Barracouta, Falcon, Sharpshooter,

and Was2) cost in repairs
     Five new, completely built, fitted, and equipped would cost

........at same rate as above
        Or these fifteen ships cost in repairs

        Fifteen similar new ships at 33/. per ton, and 55/. per horse-

power would have cost, completely built, fitted, and equipped

It is a rough rule with shipbuilders taking a number of ships during a series of

years, that old repaired ships after repair are worth about half as much as similar

Onsliips.  this basis,

        These fifteen ships cost in repair, &c. (one repair) .          . £614,394

        The value of these fifteen sliips after repair would be only . 316,857

        And would show a loss thus of                                   297,537

        Say, in round numbers                                           300,000

     Details of fourteen other ships were given, showing great excess cost in repairs,

and the conclusion arrived at was that on these twenty-nine ships' repau-s (one
repair in each case, years 1862-3 to 1864-5), the expenditiu'e they incurred was

500,000/. more than the ships were worth after such repairs had been executed.
    Numerous details were then given showmg lilce results in the 160 manu-

factories, factories, and shops of H.M.'s Dockyards, as for instance, numerous boats

repau'ed at a cost sometimes greater than double that at which similar new
boats completely built and fitted could have been made or bought.

     Cases were quoted of forgings, blanks, and numerous classes of articles that cost
20 50, and 100 per cent, more at the manufactory at one dockyard than similar

articles at another, and even the lowest cost was in many instances much greater

than the outside market cost of similar productions.

about                      ;.. ..

Or a reduction j'early of

   A considerable proportion of this was .shown to be distinctly attributed to the

reforms introduced, by which excess cost at any yard was clearly shown in detail of
' labour,' ' material,' and ' general expenditure,' and extravagant yards and manu-
factories, and factories called to accomrt, and for the future obviated.

     The system introduced into the Admiralty by the author was described in detail,

--hy which the three previously apparently unconnected sets of accounts 1. Navy

Estimates and Parliamentaiy Finance Accounts ; 2. Ship-building, Repairing and
Dockyard Expense Accounts ; 3. Manufacturing, Factory, and Engineering Estab-

lishment Accounts ; were connected and made into one great account through the
instrumentality of his Retabulations of the Navy Estimates, Appropriation Ac-
counts, and surpluses and defects on the grants, and by modifications of the ships'
and manufacturing accounts.

     It was explained fully how, by means of the author's scheme of separate rate-
book of prices for each manufactory and dockyard ; by treating each as a separate
establishment also with respect to the indirect and incidental expenditure, in
accordance with his proposals, great economical results had been obtained, by enabling
comparisons of cost in detail of labour, materials, and general expenditure to be
systematically and correctly made, and excess cost detected and checked.

  --This was largely supplemented and aided by his annual lists of differences in

the cost of similar nianufactures at the 160 manufactories, factories, Szc, of H.M.'s
se^'eral dockyards, by which every manufactory and dockyard had to account for
all such excess cost in the detail stated ; of ' labour,' ' material ' and ' general expen-
diture,' and it was shown that this had been done whilst, at the same time, a great
saving in clerical labour had been effected.

     Figures were given to show that about 5,000,000/. of yearly expenditure in detail
of shipbuildmg and manufactory had thus been brought under strict control, and

--that the saving thus through unwise expenditure being prevented, and due economy
--in material and labour being uistituted was about 600,000/. yearly.

1. Protection in the United States and its Lessons. By Geoege

                    Baden-Powell, M.A., F.B.A.8., F.8.S.

When the question of Free Trade is broached, the rejoinder is, ' Why, then, do

the United States flourish so with their Protection ? ' If we examine the facts of
the case, we shall find that in the United States prosperity exists in spite of and

not because of Protection, and that Protection has hampered and not assisted the

development of native manufactures in the United States.

Firstli/. Protection cannot seriously afiect the prosperity of the United States,

because the import trade is comparatively insignificant.

Also. The United States is an undeveloped country. It not only feeds itself, but

half its exports are food. This is a source of wealth unaffected by Protection.

[This food-producing will only affect the English market in a gradually decreas-

ing ratio : as population increases in the States it rapidly raises the cost of growing

food ; it rapidly raises the cost of carriage. The margin of profit is small now, and

will eventually be destroyed by this inevitable growth of population. The British

farmer by the end of the century will have little American competition to face.]

Also. Absolute Free Trade exists within the United States. And, considering

that this Free Trade covers an area the size of Europe, and at least equal in fer-

tility and resources, we see it is the one great factor in the prosperity of the

United States, and one that successfullj^ resists the e'sil effects of a high tariff"

towards outsiders.

Secondly. Protection has hampered and not developed manufactures.

(1) It is true that the amount of virgin soil perpetually being brought under cul-

tivation  relieves manufactures in bad times                                                                                                                                                               but even so, distress in the ' artificial
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

manufacturing districts of the States is always greater than in the ' natural ' districts

in England.

But this wealth of virgin resources not only supplies manufacturers with abun-

dant raw material, but also with a class of wealthy local consumers. This wealth

at once nourishes the body of manufacturers and conceals its diseased condition.

   We(2) find that the protected manufacturers fail to monopolise the home

marhet. The high prices, consequent on Protection, enable foreign manufacturers

to pay the high duties, and provide them with means to pierce the barrier set up.
The increase of population would naturallj' start manufactures, but is prevented

from so doing by this high tarifiF, which invites and enables foreigners to supply the

local market.

    (.3) American manufacturers do not export. What little they sell in foreign

markets is mainly what results from bad times in America. Stocks on hand that

then find no sale in the States are supplemented by stocks created by manufacturers

because of the abnormally low prices of labour in depressed circumstances.

     (4) Then, too, manufacturers are hampered on all sides by the high prices of all
they use or consume. They cannot produce cheaply, and so fail to compete in

foreign markets. Protection stifles their powers of competing. It hampers and

does not foster native manufacturing enterprise.

WhyThirdly. It may be asked.      do the people of the United States, with all

their acknowledged intelligence and cleverness, put up with such things ?

1. One reason is, they are but little aifected directly by Protection. They are

occupied almost exclusively with opening up vast virgin resources. The wealth

that results is so great that they pay little heed to the loss imposed on tbem by Pro-

tection.

2. Another plea, worked by the few that profit by Protection, acts as a great
--

672 KKPOET-- 1880.

gloss over these evils. It is that of raising revenue to carry on government. AVhile

the West is yet to be opened up, Americans turn nearly all their attention west-
wards. When the work is nearer its end they will look back, turn more attention
eastwards, and discover that a low tariff yields as much revenue as a high tariff.

     In conclusion. The lessons we learn from this instance are, generally, that Pro-

tection has acted as a drag on the prosperity of the United States, and hampered and
not fostered the development of native manufactures ; and especially that American

competition in the English food market will now gradually dwindle.

     It only remains to point out that as the United States become peopled up and
fully developed more heed will be paid to external policies ; and the interests that

now keep alive the Protection that hampers them will sink before the assertion of
wider and more popular interests.

     The spirit and acts of this age are all in favour of Free Trade. Protection ia a
mere protest of a state of things that is passing awaj-.

    2. On the Preservation of Fish and preventing the Pollution of Rivers.
By Lieut. -General Sir James E. Alexander, K.G.B., K.C.L.S., F.B.S.E.

Allusion is made to the neglect of our rivers in many parts of the United Kingdom,

and the prevalence of pollution from towns and public works. Salmon, it is stated,

is generally so dear that the poor are deprived of its use. The town of Stirling, in

Scotland, has a rent of £1,000 a year from its salmon fishery; but that will cease

if the town sewage, gas works, paraffin works, &c., continue unchecked to be dis-

Acharged into the Forth.  better state of things is reported from Callander and

Dollar, where the sewage is prevented from polluting the streams. Heavy grass

crops, beetroot, &c., are produced by the Edinburgh sewage distributed over the
--(Jraigentinny meadows. What occurs on the border river, tlie Tweed over-
Afished and polluted.
                       more stringent Act of Parliament is suggested, to deal

with river pollution and the pi-eservation and increase of fish.

3. On the required Amendment in the Marriage Laics of the United Kingdom.              I

                          Pij the Rev. Daniel Ace, D.D., F.It'.A.S.

     The desirableness of uniformitj' in these laws was shown from three gross cases
adduced. Whilst marriage is regarded as a civil contract, inducing a civil status,
conferring the same rights and entailing the same obligations upon the persons
entering into the said contract, the general feeling in the United Kingdom is in

favour of superadding to this important contract the sanction of religion.

     The matrimonial proceedings of the ceremonj^ of marriage differ in the thi-ee
kingdoms : the validity of tJie marriage solemnised in one of those kingdoms may be
rendered nugatory in the other by some legal technicality. The effects of such
diversity have been designated by Lord Chancellor Selborne as ' scandalous to a

civilised country.'

     The cases adduced, verifying the epithet, as to their effects, of the Lord Chan-
cellor, were

               1. The Queen r. Millis, 1843, 1844.
                2. Beamish v. Beamish, 1861 ; and
                3. Yelverton v. Yelverton or Longworth, 1864, 1865.
     The first, a case of bigamy, The Queen v. Millis.
     In 1829, George Millis was married to Esther Graham, according to the rites of
the Presbyterians, by an Irish Presbyterian minister, in Ireland ; and in 1836,
whilst Esther Graham remained alive, George Millis married, at Stoke, Devonshire,
Jane Kennedy, by an English priest in holy orders. In 1842, George Millis was, at

Athe Spring Assizes for Antrim, found guilty of bigamy on the aforesaid facts.

legal argument was raised in the Court of Queen's Bench, Ireland, and ultimately
carried to the House of Lords, whether the indictment for bigamy could legally be
sustained. The decision of the Appellate Court of the House of Lords quashed the
indictment for bigamy, and set aside the first marriage of George Millis, on the
principle involved in an ancient canon of the Church of England, viz., that of Arch-
                                                 --:

                    TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.        673

bishop Lanfranc, at a Council held at Winchester, a.d. 1076, ' that no marriage is

lield valid, unless by an express statute, without the benediction of a priest in holy

orders.' The late eminent and sagacious Premier, Sir Robert Peel, soon corrected

this anomaly, aft'ecting the validity of Presbyterian marriages in Ireland, by three

statutes immediately enacted by the Legislature

              &(1) 5 6 Vict, c, 113.
              &(2) G 7 Vict. c. 39, A.D. 1843.
               &(3) 7 8 Vict. c. 81, A.D. 1844.

     2. Beamish v. Beamish.

    This was a case of an episcopally ordained clergyman in Ireland, who himself

e.xclusivel}' officiated at the marriage of himself to a lady, and consequently such

maiTiage was rendered invalid, as the House of Lords decreed that the presence of

another person or priest was requisite, according to law, in the case of the clergy

as well as the laity, to receive the mutual consent of the contracting parties,

and declare them to have become man and wife, these being the essential conditions

of legal marriage.

3. Yelverton v. Yelverton or Long^-orth.

AThis case is the greatest blot upon our jurisprudence in modern times.

gentleman in Scotland went through a ceremony with a lady, which the Court of

Session declared to be a valid marriage. Subsequently, the same affianced parties

went through a ceremony before a Romish priest in Ireland, which, in the opinion

of the Irish Court of Queen's Bench, constituted a valid marriage in that kingdom

of Ireland. But on an appeal to the House of Lords, by a conflict of legal opinion

(Lords Brougham and Westbury holding the parties legally married), the House of

Lords decreed both marriage ceremonies (the one in Scotland and the other in Ire-

land) to be null and void.

Such samples of the conflict of marriage laws in the three Idngdoms must be

productive of an immense amount of practical hardship, patent injustice, and wanton

cruelty. These sad judicial results led to the institution of a Royal Commission to

make public inquiry whether the marringe laws could be assimilated. For three

years, from 1865 to 1868, the Royal Commissioners pursued their in^'estigations,

and examined some very learned persons. At length they made their report, with

diAers recommendations. Since that period nothing has been done to remedy the

crying grievances inflicted by a conflict of national laws ; and it must be a matter of

regret, if not of reproach, that no action has been taken by the responsible advisers of

the Crown that the holy estate of matrimony may be rescued from flagrant injustice.

The gist of various recommendations contained in the said report of the Commis-

sioners invoh'es the following considerations :

That the whole of the enactments respecting marriages be consolidated in a

single statute ; that all existing statutes and ordinances of the United Kingdom on

marriages (involving as a sequitur the repeal of the odious Irish Marriage Act, the

19 Geo. II. c. 13, and other penal Acts) should absolutely be repealed. The author

of this paper would venture to add, ' all canons relating to marriage resting on the

authority of statute law, by the 25 Henry VIII. c. 19 ; ' gi-eat care being observed

that by such repeal no canon on marriage expressly or virtually repealed by former

legislation be thereby re\'ived. Also, it is recommended that all stamp duties on

matrimonial documents be abolished ; and further, that marriage fees, so far as

practicable, should no longer be exacted.

Again, inter alia, it is also recommended that all licences and banns for marriage

should be superseded by a statutory declaration, made before an authorised and

whomlegally recognised minister of religion, by       the affianced parties desire their

marriage to be recognised ; and that such a minister or official should be empowered

legally to receive such a declaration, and to exact its correctness, with the same

penalty annexed for falsehood and fraud as that of the penalty for perjury ; also,

that the certainty of mamage should be legally rendered unequivocal. But reason-

able time and effective means should be supplied to interested parties to prevent

clandestine, hasty, and improvident marriages.

Moreover, parties of matiu'e age, of reputation and of status, well known to the

respective minister of religion or civil officer, desiring to facilitate their prospective

marriage, should not be required to wait by giving fifteen days' notice, but a licence
should at once be granted to consummate tlieir wishes for the immediate solemnisa-

tion of their marriage contract ; the same facilities being rendered to the poor as to

the rich, as ' marriage is honourable to all.'

WeThe publication of banns, it is admitted, is of great antiquity.  have traces

of or reference to it in the early part of the second century, in the treatises of the

Fathers, Ignatius and TertuUian. But although this ancient mode of notice of

marriage, viz., the publication of banns, has existed for more than eight hundred
years in this country, the pubhcation of them at this period of time is quite unsatis-

factory.

    What useful purpose can now be served by them, let anyone attest who has

attended divine service at Manchester Cathedral, or any parish church in a densely

populated localitj-. That such publication of intended marriages by banns is utterly
impracticable the late Registrar-General has proved by recording his decided and

valuable opinion, and to this verdict we respectfully submit. Every useful purpose

would be secured by the mere fact of a registered notice from the contracting

parties, accompanied with a true declaration of facts, exacted upon pain of the

penalties of perjury, that no legal impediment existed. Yet those who prefer the
pubhcation of their banns of marriage may be permitted to enjoy this luxury ; but

in no case should the publication of banns be required as a condition either of the

lawfulness or the regularity of marriage. All preliminary requirements should be
regarded as directory, and none of them as essential to the validity of marriage,

or in any wise to invalidate it.

    No minister of religion or ci\'il officer should arbitrarily, or without a sufficient

legal reason, interpose impediments to the reception of notices of marriage, or to

the granting certificates thereof. On the other hand, all undue or illegal facilities

to marriage should be severely pvmished.

All penalties of felony assigned to mmisters or civU officers in dereliction of their

Aduties should be reduced to those of misdemeanour.  certificate of notice by any

beneficed clergj^man should be a sufficient authority for parties to be married in

another parish, if they respectively desire it. No clergj'man should be relieved

from the obligation imposed on him by the law or sect to which he belongs ; but the
time and place of marriage are matters of which the State should take no cog-

nizance ; canonical hom-s of marriage, havmg reference to the sacrament of the
mass, in which Protestants are not interested, shoidd by Act of Parliament be
abolished. As a matter of history, we know that marriage in churches was not

established till the twelfth centurj^, by the ordinance of Pope Imiocent III. a.d.

1200.

Consensual or pre-contract marriages, per verba de prcesenti, et per verba de

future, stibsequente copula, though agreeable to the civil law {cmisensus facit

matrimoniuni) , must not be revived in England, now abolished by stat. 4 Geo. IV.
c. 76, A.D. 1823. In Scotland they are now legalised, as well as marriages by

repute ; but marriages legalised in that khigdom, and ratified by the decrees or

decision of Scotch Courts, should be recognised as being legal to the status of the

said parties in England.

    Let Mr. Monsel's Act (26 & 27 Vict. c. 90), with respect to the registration of
Roman Catholic marriages in Ireland, instead of being directory, be rendered, by

Act of Parliament, imperative.

  -- --The Canon Law of Europe does not it never did ^form a part of the Law of

England. It does as to marriage in Scotland. But the laws of the CoimcU of

Trent were never acknowledged in England. But latterly, in the formerly excepted
Provinces of Ireland, the canons of the Council of Trent are revived. Hence

arise the dire conflict of the laws of marriage ui the three kingdoms in the adminis-

tration of justice, and the cancelling iu England of one of the most important con-

tracts of aU social relations which in one of the two other sister kingdoms may be
held valid. And all this through the glorious xmcertainty of the laws of marriage,

as appears in grievous suits of litigation.

         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  675

      Such are the arguments of the author of this paper for the immediate inter-
position of the Legislature, and for the strong support of the Government, to sweep
away a heterogeneous congeries of at least twenty-seven Acts of Parliament
and other diverse ordinances, and to enact a general marriage law for the three
kingdoms, admitting and legalising the peculiarities of each, but securing for all
the certainty of a valid and indisputable marriage, for the legitimacy and peace
of families, and for the maintenance of the rights and preservation of the property
of the married pair. In doing this let every care be taken to prevent the scandals
which occurred through the unscrupidous conduct of unworthy clergymen prior

to Lord Hardwicke's Act (26 Geo. II. c. 13), now happily repealed ; but its best
provisions are now incorporated in the English Marriage Acts. Fox and Mackin-
tosh unsparingly condemned this Act for its tyranny. But the doctrine of non

Jien debet, factum vcdeat admits of some state regulation. That Fleet Prison and

May Fair ' marriages were a scandal to a civilised and Christian country, those

acquainted with history will readily admit. But the greater scandal arising from

 a conflict of marriage laws, imcertain in their operation, remains.

      To remedy this scandalous contravention of the marriage laws, the nation calls
 aloud. Marriage, says Lord StoweU, is the parent of civil society ; but, more

 than this, it is the basis of social science, and of sound morals ; it is the purest

 source of domestic affection and of angelic virtue.

--4. On DiminisMng Annuities a Neo-Philosopliy in Lending Funds.

                         By Fkederick N. Newcome.

The assertion that a debt of any magnitude can be actually redeemed within a

limited period at a less expenditure than is involved in the payment of interest on

an interminable one, during the same number of years, may appear startling, even in
this era of remarkable siu*prises. When speaking of redemption, I mclude the pay-

ment of regular dividends and the reimbursement of the principal. Antagonistic

to common sense as this statement may appear, its feasibility^^and practicabilit}' can

be readily demonstrated. Such is the miracidous power of compound interest that
when once a departm-e is taken from the laws governing the three recognised

financial philosophies, the apparent paradox involved in this equation is easily

explained away. To enounce that a debt can be repaid with less than the cost of
interest sounds an extreme paralogism ; but it is nevertheless true, and must be
admitted as a neo-philosophy into the world of economic science. The discovery

was made by myself about twelve months ago, when elaborating a plan of redemp-
tion permitting of a frequent reduction in the aimual charge. On comparing

it with the cost of annuities for the same number of years, it was at once visible

--that some fresh and important phenomena had to be considered a new and potent

--power was at work somewhere a vast economy had been effected ! but how ?

There stood the figiu'es bold enough, 3,508,054Z., to liquidate a six per cent, loan of

1,000,000Z. in sixty -two years. There they were,, correct and indisputable, while it

was equally clear that an interminable debt must entail, for interest alone, 60,000/.

paid for sixty-two years, or 3,720,000/., and the debt of 1,000,000/. would still be

Aowing.  gross saving had resulted of 211,946/., plus the capital, or ] ,211,946/.,

in all. What is of more importance to science, it was clear that when the gross

cost by this new principle is compared with that of annuities or debentures expiring

in the same number of years, there must be a net saving of 315,103/. on the cheapest

methods of redemption hitherto known. It is at once cognoscible that the omni-

potent power of compoimd interest is at work in an intensified form. Those who

--have acquaintance with actuarial calculations are constantly reminded of its illimit-

able potency a potency augmenting, we may almost saj', by involution, as the rate

of interest increases and the duration extends. Having stated that the action of

compound interest is the efficient and acting cause producing the phenomena, it

might prima facie be concluded that, to secure the end in view, a great present

sacrifice is ine'vitable. But such is not the case ; a veiy small one is sufficient, but,

of course, with each augmentation to the first-created sinking fund, a vast addition
to the ultimate saving wUl accrue. In the instance cited above the original fund is

a half per cent, or 5,000/. per million. To redeem that amount of six per cent, deht,

of diminishing annuities, or by a checked cumulative sinking fund, is

renders it absolutely impossible to favour the redemption of any particular bonds.

     2. The investment must be returned at some uncertain, but not distant, date,

--and until its repayment regular interest ia received. It is on this question the

--preservation of wealth that this system so immensely preponderates over its ri^·al,

the terminable annuity. The one promotes extravagance and injures posterity

the other inculcates thrift, and safeguards the rights of future generations.

3. The principle is susceptible of unlimited modification, the magnitude or small-

ness of the debt being of no account one way or the other, except that small sums

are always more readily handled.

4. The sinking fund is absolutely inviolable, and owing to this characteristic

may commence at a fractional sum; juJuuth part of the principal will redeem a 10 per

cent, debt in seventy-three years; while j^^o^h part will suffice to repay a 5 per

cent, debt in eighty-one years. The attention of statesmen and economists should

be more earnestly directed to the various phases of this truly grand financial evolu-

tion. In England especially it has been neglected for the study of antiquated and

malevolent schemes, and the outcome is that, having paid the debt six or seven

times over, we still owe 780 millions. Large as the debt undoubtedly is, its liqui-

dation would not be difficult to a nation of such vast resources as England, provid-

ing that we at once discard the present amusement of ' playing at repayment,' and

Weadopt, in lieu thereof, a grand and invincible principle.                                                                              can well afford the

luxury, as by so doing taxation is instantaneously reducible by a couple of millions

sterling, while the ultimate extinction of the debt is uncontrollably assured.

5. By periodically checking the cumulative sinking fund provision can be made

for a rapid reduction in taxation.

In the above epitomised summary of the salient features of the leading financial

principles, it will have been observed that I lean strongly to the last, although the

novel scheme of liquidation I now promulgate is equally applicable, by either of

the three. Perhaps the most valuable lessons may be taught the inhabitants of
Great Britain, if I address my remarks almost exclusively' to the subject of our

stupendous encumbrance.

Space prevents more than a summary being given of the periodical paj'ments

required, by one or two plans. I exhibit the amounts, first at per million of debt

secondly, for the funded debt ; and, thirdly, for the total of the gross debts.

     I now request your attention to plans 6 and 7, which are drawn up especially

myfor practical purposes, not to demonstrate the capacity for modification of

principle, or the vastness of the economies to be eSected. Examining plan No. 6,
it is noticeable that after 40 years the excess for sinldng fund entirely ceases.

From the 41st to 50th year the annual payment is the same as for perpetual in-
terest, and from the 51st to the last year it is decreasingly less. The total disburse-
ment on account of the sinking fund is, in the forty years, some 140,000/. per

million, or 99,400,000/. for the funded debt ; while in the last 39 years the total
saving is 165,000/. and 117,150,000/. respectively, which more than compensates

for the earlj' sacrifice. If we study the problem from an every-day, instead of a

theoretical, standpoint, it is evident that to redeem the debt need cost the country

NOTHING. This generation lays out 99,400,000/. by 40 instalments, to be retiu-ned
with interest to its successors. If 89 years is considered too long a term, the
payments from the 41st year can be equalised at 3 per cent, on the capital,
and the debt annihilated in 81J years. The net cost of redemption will then be
99,400,000/. or 14 per cent.

     I will now ask you to inspect plan 7. You will observe that the same method

of repayment is continued up to the 80tli j'ear, but that from the 81st the annuity

is 2/. instead of 21. 5s., and the annual payment is fixed at 20,000/. instead of

22,500/. per million. In introducing this variation my object is to impress upon

the mind, with redoubled force, the extraordinary potency of compound interest,
when judiciously applied. Although the funded debt charge for the final period
averages 1,775,000/. less by the last plan, liquidation occupies little more than a
year longer ; while the aggregate sum required for interest and sinking fund is
augmented by 2,737,050/. only. Prolonging the term of redemption has the

--effect of showing up the new philosophy in more brilliant colours the saving

when compared with perpetual annuities being 63,145/. per million more, or when

compared with annuities for terms of years or cumulative sinking funds,

271,184/. 13s. 4c/. against 225,539/. 13s. M. The correct figures for the funded

debt are, as against perpetual annuities, 12,689,830/. by plan No. 6, and 52,552,780/.

by plan No. 7. This is excluding the 710,000,000/. capital paid ofi'. When com-

pared with annuities or cumulative sinking fund loans terminating in 89 or 91
years, the net savings are over 160 and 192 millions respectively. The limitation

of time prevents notice being taken of many other important phenomena which

occur to my mind, but I trust sufiicient information has been given to enable

economists and financiers to thoroughly investigate this neo-philosophy in sinking

funds and annuities, and that sooner or later we may see its principles adopted in

this and other countries.

1. What is Capital? The Contradictory Responses of Economists to this

    question examined from the ground of Actual Fact and Life. By
    W. Westgaeth.

    The author, after alluding to the late Mr. Bagehot's remark, that many who

were conversant with economic theory were not so with economic facts, and vice-
versa, went on to illustrate this by the case of capital, which is still so disputed a

subject in Political Economy. The question What is Capital ? is still answered

by economists in a most various and unsatisfactory way. Approaching the question
from the side of a large conversancy with economic facts, he would point out where
the conclusions of economic theory appeared to him at variance with the facts

of life. He first gave the prevailing theories as to capital, and then contrasted
them with what capital actually was in the world of fact and life. Adam Smith's

view was, that everything dealt with to yield revenue or profit was Capital. This
view, although still partially held, had been largely departed from since, and the
prevailing view now was, that capital was that only which was concerned in pro-
duction. Then again arose the question of two kinds of capital, the iixed and the
circulating, and what rule or principle distinguished them. Here Smith's criterion
was fixity as distinguished'frotn mobility ; but Ricardo had suggested rather relative
durability, and in this had carried most economists with him, so that the prevail-
ing view now was that things of a durable kind, as land, buildings, railways, were
of fixed capital, while perishable or renewable things, as food, clothing, furniture,
were of circulating capital. But as Professor Jevons and others admit, there is
no clear line between a throng of things which are neither very durable nor yet

very perishable. He then passed to a suggestion of Mr. Jevons, which he noticed

favourably as tending to a correct view of capital. This is in effect that the so-
called fixed capital is not itself capital, but is that which has had capital spent

upon or sunk in it. He proposes thus to distinguish a ' free ' from an invested

capital. But as to this free capital, he falls back upon the ' production ' idea,
already adverted to, and limits capital to articles of food, clothing, furniture, and
such direct needs of ' labour of all kinds and classes.' Lastly, as to the origin,
maintenance, and increase of capital, most economists are agreed that these all
result from sa^-ing, abstinence, and improving industry, so that the less the spend-
ing of what is produced, the more the capital, and on apparently to indefinite

increase.

     All these views Mr. Westgarth considered to differ more or less from that of
the capital of fact as confronting us in actual life. This capital we see to be one

-- --fund one homogeneous fund we might call it wliich supports indiscriminately

not production only, but all exchange or business lil'e. He insisted, as speaking
from the world of fact, that exchange was essential to the idea of capital. What

caused exchange was the subdivision, or, to speak more comprehensively, the
association of labour. With the association of labour, he remarked, we enter upon
Economic Science, and it has thus, in this its limitation, a sufiiciently marked
distinction from the far wider Sociology, or the Science of Societj-. Capital,
then, is the fruit of exchange. It consists of the stock of things which arise and

are maintained as the needs of exchange. These stocks are mainly of three kinds :
first, raw materials, or thmgs in preparation for our use ; second, the things pre-
pared, and for sale in the shops and markets; and third, the prepared things
which are not passed out of exchange for ' consumption,' but kept as the ' rolling
stock ' of trading or exchanging life. The chief and most notable item of this thu'd

kind is money. Money is simply one kind of goods used to value the other
kinds, and where independently originated, it has ahvaJ^s made its first appearance

in this simple 'wa.j. Coinage and the change of material for the * precious metals
were afterthoughts to increase convenience, but they noways altered relationships.

--The fund of capital then consisted of goods and monej' of these indiscriminately,

as one and the same class of things. This fund was distinguished from the so-called
fixed capital, which, as to its leading idea, was not capital at all, but only agency,

which agency, in conjuction with that of man himself, enabled us to produce the

real things of capital, namely the requisites of our direct use. Lnnd, for instance,
is such agency, and only its crop belongs to capital. These direct requisites are
capital while within the sphere of exchange ; outside of exchange they cease to
be capital. Thus the limitation or law of capital is that it constitutes the stocks
required for the time being by exchange. As exchange extends in a country and

larger stocks are needed, (here is more capital to the country. What causes ex-

change or trading to extend, in spite of this cost of larger capital, is the increased
economy of production gained by the larger scale of business. All trade extension

is an everlasting battle between, on the one band, the increased {)rofit by cheaper

production, and on the other, the increased cost of the larger capital requirement.

Successful trade extension is that which, in increasing a country's income, increases

Lawconcurrently also the total of its capital. There is then a '  of Capital,' and

these are its chief elements.

2. Bemarlcs and Statistics relating to Siuansea Usages and Customs as thei/

    affect the Sellers of Foreign or Colonial Copper Ores. By Wm. Hen-

      derson.

     I have chosen the occasion of the meeting of the British Association at Swansea
as a fitting time and place for the discussion of this very important subject. It is
a matter of great local importance, and here it is most likely to receive an intelli-

gent and practical treatment. No doubt from the standpoint of the sellers of
foreign ores, the clamant evils of the system have long ago called for redress. For
many years we have suffered from delays, inaccuracies, and all the evils inherent
in this antiquated system, and striven to remedy it as best we could, and have
succeeded, where we had to deal with rich ore, reguluses, or precipitate, to a

certain e.x:tent, and completely, so far as Cliili bars are concerned ; but to the very
large quantity of poor ores, such as the Spanish and Portuguese ores, the whole of

the Swansea system applies in all its inconsistency and rigour ; and my object in
this paper is to show the hardships we are altogether unnecessarily subjected to,
and to propose a remedy'. I may also here premise that we do not complain of the
actual price paid us for our ores, as I do not believe that we should get a penny
more were the system changed to-morrow. But what we complain of is the system
by which that price is arrived at, and the enormous waste of time before we get

' agreed ' residts. I purpose treating this subject under the following heads :
     1. Swansea public sales or ' ticketings.'
     2. Sales by private bargain at Swansea and elsewhere based on Swansea sales.
     3. Sales by private bargain based otherwise than Swansea.
     4. Weights and allowances.

     5. Dry assay and its relations to the truth, as shown by actual results by

        --smelting and Avet process. Time consumed in getting settled results

                   differences.

    6. Wet assay.
    7. What ought to be the simple basis of price ?

                1. Swansea Public Sales or Ticketinys.

     Public sales of copper ores at Swansea, several years ago, used to be very regu-
larly held once a fortnight, and the quantities of ore were then very large and

important. This is now no longer the case. For the year 1877 there were only

twenty-three sales ; for 1878, only eighteen sales ; and for 1879, only fifteen sales.

--The quantities sold were insignificant being for the three years collectively

112,604 tons.

     The usual custom with foreign ores which are to be disposed of by public sales

--is as follows : They are usually consigned to one or other of the ore yards, such

as those of Messrs. Bath & Sons, or Messrs. Richardson & Sons, where the ore is

landed, and, if necessary, crushed and put out in square or oblong piles about 2 to

2^ feet deep, and in parcels of from 50 to 100 tons and less. These are generally

put forward for next sale, and a day is appointed for sampling, when intended

Apurchasers are represented as well as the seller.  period of fourteen days is

allowed between the date of sampling and the day of sale, which is considered

necessary to allow the assays to be made. On an average it takes fourteen days

more to prepare and crush the ore previous to sampling, and all this is attended
with a very serious expense, besides the delay. As we do not know when another

sale will take place at Swansea, we save time and lose nothing by adhering to

previous sale.
--682 EEPORT 1880.

    Two tables were here given, showing what time is lost between the delivery of

the ore and the settlement of the assay and price.

     During the whole of these nmnhers of days, ranging from sixteen, which appears

to he the shortest, up to sixty-two days, we cannot deliver our invoices, and have
to ^vait for our money all that time. This great hardship is further aggravated to
the importer who sells his raw ore to the sulphuric acid makers for sulphur value

only, and takes back the cinders. These have to be again sampled and assayed,
with the delays repeated. If he is also a copper extractor, as I am, and sells his
precipitate, that has again to be sampled and assayed, and the same delays re-

peated, so that it niay be qiute a common event that from the time of landing till
the time of realisation eight months may elapse, and the same copper be assayed
three times. The costs by sale at public ticketings are very considerable, amounting

in Spanish ores to fully half the freight, which, with present low prices of copper,

may be all the profit. This is not the custom when sold by private bargain, as

these sales as a rule are generally ex ship. It is, therefore, evident that if an
importer can sell his ores to arrive e.v ship by private bargain, lie will not send
them to the Swansea sales ; and surely this is not a state of things conducive to the
prosperity of Swansea or its industries.

2, 3. Sales by pfivate bargain at Swansea and elsewhe^-e based on Swansea sales.

The great bulk and value of these sales are made elseivhere than at Swansea

and the preceding sale                                                                                    or, if  any Swansea sale takes place on the day of sampling,
                                                                                                       ;

that sale is taken as the basis of price. The object is, of course, to save time, and

one has to take the risk of a rise or fall in the price of copper between the dates of

sale and that of delivery. Our friends the copper-smelters at Swansea will, how-

ever, admit that so far as the produce of Spain and the economical treatment of the

raw Spanish or Portuguese ores are concerned, or even for the smelting of the burnt

ores, the processes of Swansea were quite unable to deal with the large quantities

in any economical way. With the raw ores, as a rule, the very large percentage of

sulphur, viz. 48 per cent., would have been worse than wasted, as it would have

mcost something considerable to calcine such ores, rich sulphur and poor in copper,

down to the point to make them produce per se (or even mixed with other calcined

ores) a sufficiently rich regulus. Besides the enormous increase of nuisance, and

even when in later days the sulphuric acid manufacturers came to use the sulphur,

the cinders still contamed 60 per cent, of metallic iron, and which when sent to

Swansea, from such distant places as Newcastle and Glasgow, at heavy freights,

only 4 per cent, to 6 per_cent. of the weight was paid for, and the whole of the

iron contents were lost. By the introduction of my wet process at this juncture,

the shipment of these burnt ores from all the districts of large consumption was

rapidly stopped, and the ores treated on the spot, saving the freights and iron ore,

--and yielding much more perfect results for copper thus preventmg very large

quantities of ores coming to Swansea. And so in like manner the enormous yields

of the Spanish and Portuguese mines (which are constantly increasing), over and

above their possible sales for sulphuric acid purposes at home and on the Con-

tinent has gradually led to great extension of the slow process of cementation from

the poorer grades of ore, produced at very small cost, in enormous quantities,

reckoned by hundreds of thousands of tons, for each of the uncovered mines per
annum a very large and increasing annual production of copper, as precipitate, of

from 50 to 75 per cent, produce is annually obtained.

Another reason why the public sales at Swansea have decreased, and are there-

fore no longer a fair basis for private sales made elsewhere, is the most serious of aU.
By the_ opening up of short railways to the mines, and the great development of

coal mining. Chili now sends most of her produce to this country, as Chili bars, or

in blocks containing about 96 per cent, pure copper. So serious is this production,

that it may be stated roughly as a fact that Chili exports as much copper in ores,

reguluses, bars, and ingots as all the rest of the world produces, and almost the

whole of this is sold by private bargain, and the price is regularly quoted every busi-

ness day, and virtually rules the price of copper.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  683

     The statistics given below from the Board of Trade returns for the last three
j-ears amply prove what a small proportion of the copper imported is sold at Swansea
public sales, and how much by private bargain.

     There can be no argument in favour of the maintenance of the 21-cwt. ton and

allowance, except some antiquated custom, and there is much in favour of its imme-
diate abolition. We, the sellers of foreign ores, do not for a moment suppose that

so far as price is concerned the abolition of these absurd and antiquated customs

Wewill secure us trnj advantage whatever.  are perfectly aware that the receiving

of these allowances by the buyer, and the giving of them by the seller, have all been

taken into calculation by both. Our only argument here is, what is the use of

introducing gratuitously into a simple calculation complications of this sort, wliich

Weare admittedly discounted previously?    consider this a grievance that only

requires to be stated to be admitted, and as its maintenance benefits no one, but

wastes time and leads to needless book-keeping, we earnestly trust our friends the

smelters will agree to their early discontinuance.

     refined, and Cupjm- sold as B. S. or Tough Cake. The Wet Assay tested in the
    same manner, and as cotnpared with the Dry Assay.

myIt will be more convenient to treat these two divisions of         subject together.

I do not intend here to enter into any description of either the diy or the wet assay,

and their modes of operation. In the Chemical Sections of this, or a future meeting,

I hope to have an opportunity of discussing these fully.

    What we importers of foreign ores have chieHy to complain of in the method of

the dry assay is the unreasonably long time it takes to get agreed results, and the

constant disputes, wliicli require a considerable amount of very unpleasant and

vexatious cori'espondence, which generally ends in a reference ; and all this con-

sumes valuable time. I have enough and to spare of statistics to prove this argu-

--ment against the dry assay method the long and inconsistent delay in settling

--results a delay and uncertainty in which the disputes are so chronic that I venture

to say no other class of merchants would have endured them one year without

seeking some remedy.

   A set of results furnished me by Messrs. Mason i^- Barry show that no possible

reliance can be placed upon the dry assay, as in the same cai'go, delivered from the

same ship, but divided amongst several customers, totally different results are ob-

tained. Now, I am not prepared to go so far as this, as it goes quite against mj-
general experience. In my view', it is a perfect proof that the mode of sampling is

utterly wrong, when the sampler for the buyer and the sampler for the seller are

permitted to take their samples by running over a series of loaded trucks and each

chip off about a shovelful from a six or ten ton truck from large pieces of ore. Mix

--them together and call this a sample ! ! The results of divided cargoes which, if

properly sampled, woidd go to prove the dry assay utterly worthless, are, when not

--certain on the point of sampling, misleading are jet so instructive, that I have

ventured to give them here as facts which bear somewhat of an important argument

against the di-y assay.

Then against the dry assay we have a special charge that the assayers very often

disagree, and the result is a reference to a third assayer with a corresponding loss

of time. This has very frequently to be undergone, especially with burnt ores, and

in most cases the third assayer agrees "with neither of the others.

As a contrast to this, I recently caused the Seville Sulphur and Copper Company

to send a sample from their usual imports from their two mines, one comparatively

rich and the other very poor, to five of the best known chemists who make a speci-

ality of analysis of minerals, and I give below their results, and it will be seen how*

closely they agree.

     It will also be seen that tlie dry assay is uniformly too low, and always con-
siderably short of the truth. This is proved not only by its difference from the wet
assay, but also by actual results obtained by smelting, where the surplus copper
forms a very considerable portion of the profit. But the wet assay is proved to be

the true assay by results obtained on the large scale when my process of extraction

is used, and the precipitate produced refined. I give the i-esults from four different
works, in situations far distant from each other, and all for the same year. The

Dworks are placed in the order of their erection, being the most recent and the

most perfect in construction.

21-cwt. tons and 24^ lbs. draft per ton can possibly be retained with any show

of reason. As to the dry assay on rich ores and reguluses, I think I have clearly

proved that, at all events as far as precipitate is concerned, it is always below

the truth by a good many per cents., and the same must be said of all ores
between 10 and 90 per cent. On the other hand, (I^hili bars, which have only

to be refined, should be refined by the process they have to go through to make

them fine copper, and I think the dry assay is the nearest corresponding pro-
cess they could be subjected to. At all events, the wet and the dry assays almost

entirely agree in Chili bars; an occasional difierence of ^ per cent, is entirely due
to the opinion of the refiner whether he has actually got refined copper or not

'B.S.' or *T.C.' But with precipitate it is very different, particularly that pro-

duced  by  the  '  salt  process  ;     there is  always a difference of at least 4 per  cent.  In
                                     '

the early days there used regularly to be 11 per cent, difference, but now, though not

satisfactory, it is much better. Still, I think aU ores and reguluses, inchiding pre-

cipitate, ought to be assayed by the wet method, and the results stated in whole

numbers and decimal fractions, and be paid for including the second place of deci-

mals. The basis of price should be in proportion to the official price of refined

copper as quoted on the day of sampling, or if there is no official or quoted market

price on that day, then the last preceding quotation. As there are several qualities

of refined copper, the medium quality, or what is known as ' Tough Cake,' woidd,

I think, be faii-est. Chili bars, which form such a large proportion of the material

out of which refined copper is produced, and are officially quoted every market day,

might also be taken ; but as these may cease to be produced, it would be better, T

think, to base the price on the price of ' Tough Cake.' Then, as to the proportional

price for all percentages of ores, leaving a fair margin to smelters and extractors,

Athis can be arrived at very much as is done at present.  complete set of tables, I

would suggest, could be constructed by a committee of smelters, extractors, and

importers, and these should be printed by authority of this committee, and available

to any purchaser. I would suggest also that a committee of chemists should also

settle and publish -with the book a very minute description of the best Imown wet

method of assay, and that this method of assay be, and remain until altered by

authority, the standard method of assay. It would not be necessary in these tables,

myin opinion, to go further than to state opposite each percentage or bracketed

set of produces how many shillings and pence per unit these produces are worth.

Anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of figures from these data would

find the price per ton of ore. By means of the wet assay, which can be made with

great rapidity and exactness, and with this authoritative data as to the value per

unit, invoices coidd be rendered within a few days, or even hours, after sampling,

with perfect confidence.

       3. Progress of the English Stations in the Hill Regions of India.

                              By Hyde Claeke, V.P.S.S.

Mr. Clarke stated that the Himalayan ranges to the north possess the cool climate

of England, and that Englishmen thrive there. This had early attracted the atten-

tion of our great administrators, who, beginning with Simla in 1818 and Darjeeling

in 1828, had formed a series of stations, which had performed the functions of

sanitaria, watering-places, and militarj' posts, of metropolis and capitals, and latterly

Aalso of centres of tea-culture.        chain of hills passed as a backbone through India

on the west, in which were seated some minor stations. He had shown how by tele-

graph connection these towns were as well suited as the unhealthy cities of the

plains for governmental and military purposes. In a series of statistics he illus-

trated the condition of the tea and cinchona plantations and the breweries. He

estimated the hill products as approaching a million in value, including 10,000,000

lbs. of tea and 3,500,000 lbs. of coffee. The gross imports from the foreign hill

AUstates he estimated at about 2,000,000^. yearly.  this trade was capable of exten-

sion by careful administration. Thibet and China are closed to us ; where Russian

power extends our trade ceases. Nepaul excludes us, and our own feudatory in

Kashmere but grudgingly allows us access. The oppression and misgovernment of
TRAKS ACTIONS OF SECTION F.  687

the latter country require a removal of the ruler. In a political point of view it
was admitted that the hills, although so little used, afforded suitable quarters for a
large portion of our English army, which would greatly increase its efficiency.
The development of the hill regions would create an availahle reserve, while India
would obtain what was essential for its welfare, greater security from aggression

from without and from dissension among the various conflicting races within the

peninsula. It was, however, chiefly in reference to the interests of civilisation in
the advancement of India that the development of the English population in the

hill countries of India was to be regarded. He showed too that the aboriginal

races might in this respect receive great benefit. The progress which had been
made in the hills within the last twenty years, almost without care, showed what
was to be efiected in the future.

     The Presibent delivered the following Address :

As time will not permit of a generally detailed description, I propose, in the
Address which I have the honour and pleasure to make as President of your Section,

to describe generally the past and present condition of the port of Swansea, as typical
of the rise and progress of the various ports in the Bristol Channel within the last
half-century, and the vast improvements which have been effected in the nature and
extent of the accommodation pro'V'ided to meet the requirements of the shipping of
the present day as regards dock facilities and appliances for the rapid and economi-
cal loading and discharging of their cargoes rendered necessary by the amount of
active competition in every branch of commerce, both export and import.

      I propose to confine myself in this address generally to the engineering history
of Swansea Harbour, but I think it necessary, in the first place, briefly to describe
certain features of the Bristol Channel, resulting in the peculiar advantages its
harbours possess over those of the eastern coast, due to the greater tidal range.

     At its entrance between St. Govan's Head on the north and Plartland Point on
the south, its width is 42 miles, gradually contracting, until at King Road at the
mouth of the Eiver Avon, 92 miles distant, its width is only 4i miles, the residt
being a proportionate ele^ation of the tidal wave in its progress upward, so that in
Swansea Bay spring tides rise 28 feet, at Cardiff 35 feet, and at Avonmouth 40

feet, and in consequence engineers have been enabled to provide for the entrance of
the largest class of shipping by proAddiug at the various docks recently constructed
a greater depth of water than is generally practicable on the eastern coast. The
cill of the dock at present in process of construction at Swansea will have a depth
over it at spring tides of 32 feet, while the existing cill of the Roath Dock at
'Cardiff has 35 feet 8^ inches over it ; that of the Alexandra Dock at Newport 35

--feet, and the Avonmouth Dock 39 feet greater depths than exist over the lock cills

of any of the ports on the eastern coast generally.

     It would extend my address to an unnecessary length to describe the vast im-

provements which have taken place at all the ports in the Bristol Channel within

the past half-century. The port of Swansea may fairly be taken as a type, inas-
much as from its position it has natiu-al difficulties to contend with, requiring, as

At Cardiff, extensive works seaward in order to provide the reqiusite depth of
 water, such works not being necessary in the case of the docks at Newport, Avon-
 mouth, or Portishead.

     As regards its situation, the port is placed nearly in the centre of Swansea Bay,
                                                                                   --
                                                                                            ;

at the mouth of the river Tawe, partially sheltered from prevailing winds by the
INFimihles Headland hearing from tl;e harbour entrance south-west three-quarters

west, the shelter from that headland affording good anchorage as regards holdino-

ground, but subject to the range of the sea in south-westerly gales. The entrance

to the port is exposed from south-west three-quarters west to south-east, the

heaviest seas occurring when the ^^·ind is south-westerly or directly up the Channel.

     Previoiis to the year 1794 no engineers appear to have been consulted as to the
improvement of the port, which at that period simply consisted of the bed of the
River Tawe, the latter discharging over the flat foreshore after passing through

a small subsidiary bay, termed Fabian's Bay, lying between two points of land
called Black Point and Salthouse Point, the entrance being fully exposed to the
range of the sea from the points of the compass before enumerated, and con-
.sequently blocked up by sand driven into it by the action of south-westerly seas,
and only accessible at spring tides in fair weather by a small class of coasting

Teasels.

     In the year 1794 the then Trustees consulted Captain John Huddard, F.R.S.,

who at that time had the reputation of being an eminent marine engineer, and a

perusal of whose report shows that, having regard to the meagi-e knowledge of

harbour improvements at that pei-iod, he possessed great powers of observation and

considerable practical engineering knowledge. In his first report, which is of con-

Mderable length, dated 24th September 1794, he states that he was called upon

ty the Trustees to answer various queries generally bearing on the possibilitv of

providing an increased depth of water by improving what is termed the ' bar ' or

sand carried into the navigable channel by the tidal action in south-westerly gales,

and the protection of the harboiu' entrance from the inrun of the sea during those
m\vinds. The condition of the harbour at that period
                                                                           regard to depth can be
--inferred from the following passage in his report ' On the 5th August I foimd

only 8 feet of water in the harbour, and in the evening of the 31st July a vessel of

about 13 feet draught of water, in sailiug out of the harbour, grounded upon the

bar, where she remained till the 10th August, when the tide rose to take her off;

and every ship in the harbour loaded to that draught of water, and ready to sail at

that time, must suffer the same detention.'

     Captain Huddard gave as his opinion that a greater depth of water could not
Ije obtained, nor the drifting of the sand from the effect of the sea into the entrance
channel prevented, without the construction of piers, which he termed the eastern
and western piers, the first extending from Black Point and the latter from Salt-
house Point, which piers in consequence of his recommendation were subsequently
constructed. Captain Huddard further observes that the increased depth antici-
pated consequent on their construction ' would continue so long as the tide is
.·suffered to flow up the river as at present,' but at the same time it would appear
that a project was then entertained, often since revived, for damming the river and

converting it into a floating dock, as his report contains the following passao-e

* Should the river be embanked for a floating dock, sluices will be necessary to clear

away the silt out of the channel which the sea will deposit in the outer harbour

for though the harbour of Swansea will not be so liable to silt as many others from

the strength of the tide in the Severn being thrown off by the Mumbles and Nash

Points                              yet, in fresh gales, the  same  being  impregnated with mud, will deposit it
                                 ;

in the harbom* and require a current to clear it out of the channel.'

The construction of the West Pier, as recommended by Captain Huddard, was

carried out, and in May 1804 he was again called on to report. He states that the

only alteration which he observed on his second visit was that the sand to the extent

of 270 yards south of the pier head was worn down nearly one foot, but that what

was termed the ' Bar ' seaward was higher than the harbour entrance, and that

it was absolutely necessary to complete the Eastern Pier in order to secure a

pennauent depth of water and to afibrd the necessary protection from south-

westerly winds. The Eastern Pier was in consequence constructed, the result beinc

the prolongation of the river current and the driving of the bar further seaward,
and in the year 1831 it was reported that a depth of 21 feet existed over it at
snrinsr tides, as anticipated in Captain Huddard's report of 1794.

     In the year 1826 the Trustees consulted Mr. Telford, and he reported on Feb-
ruary 5 of the following year. At that period what was termed the harbour was
simply the bed of the river Tawe ; the shipping lying within it were endangered
by exposure to the action of heavy floods, and he recommended that the present

--new cut should be made as a channel for the river no doubt an important and

necessary work; but he again revived the old engineering heresy of recommending

the conversion of this new cut and of the old harbour into floats with a river
overflow and draw sluices. He further recommended the direction of the ebbing

current seaward by slag banks, in order to act upon the bar. These propositions of
Mr. Telford were generally approved of by Mr. H. R. Palmer in a report addressed

to the Trustees iu January 1831, and he further recommended the prolongation of

the Western Pier.

Similar propositions were recommended by other engineers, among them the

late Mr. Jesse Hartley ; but fortunately for the future of the port of Swansea, none

of the works for the conversion of the river into a float were executed. The new
cut, or channel, for the river was commenced in 1840, and finished in 1844, the

eflect being to materially lessen the risk to shipping lying within the harbour or

original bed of the river during floods, and iu giving a better direction to the ebbing

current.

In 1845, what is termed the Pottery Entrance was constructed under the direc-

tion of Mr. Rendel, with a double cill, as a provision for the canalising of the river

or the new cut at a future period. The masonry of this entrance I found completed

myat the period of  first visit  to  Swansea in  the  month  of  February 1849, and the

project was still entertained of converting the river and new cut into a float, rela-

--tive to which I reported iu the following words : ' Any interference with the

channel of the river or new cut which would prevent the free influx and reflux of

the tide, would, I am of opinion, be most prejudicial to the harbom- entrance. In

times of flood, the river current is no doubt an active agent in deepening and

removing obstruction from the entrance channel ; but, under ordinary circumstances,

its volume is too small to have any material effect. On reference to sections taken

by the late Mr. Price, I find that 40,000,000 cubic feet or thereabouts of tidal water

ebbs each tide from the river channel alone, independent of the backwater from

Fabian's Bay, and I am of opinion that, although the land-floods are active agents

in deepening and removing obstructions from the entrance channel, the tidal water

is the main agent in maintaining and keeping it clear, and that every facility should

be given by deepening the bed of the river to aid its upward flow, and that in pro-

portion as the bed of the river is lowered the entrance channel will be deepened.'

To that opinion, expressed upwards of thirty years ago, I still adhere. The system

of discharging a volume of water at the period of low tide from reservoirs, and

thereby creatuig a shallow stream as a means of preserving a navigable channel

myand a sandy foreshore, is, in      opinion, entirely futile, and in the case of several

important Continental harbours threatens seriously to interrupt the regular postal

.service between tliis country and the Continent.

    Upon my visit in 1849, with the exception of the masonry of what is termed the

Pottery Entrance and the various wharves on each side of the old river-bed and of

the New Cut, no works had been executed of any magnitude ; the harbour still con-

sisted of the original river-bed composed of hard gravel worn uito irregularities by

the occasional action of floods, and the superior class of shipping engaged in the

copper ore trade was constantly strained in taking the uneven ground. As regards
communication with the harbour, no railways were in existence, and I used to make
the journey from Aberdeen, in Scotland, to Swansea, entirely by coach. The gross
revenue of the hai-bour Avas about 7000/. per annum at that time ; during the present

year it is estimated at about 60,000/.

     After considerable discussion, the Trustees determined in November 1849 to

convert the tidal harbour, or old bed of the river, into a floating dock with an outer

half-tide basin, of the respective areas of 11 and 2| acres, the half-tide basin entrance
being 60 feet in width, with a depth over the cill of 25 feet 6 inches, at high water
spring tides. Between the half-tide basin and dock, a lock was constructed, 160 feet

in length and 60 feet wide, with a depth over the cill of 22 feet 6 inches ; these
--

dimensions were considered, at the time, ample for the largest class of shipping

frequenting the port. At that period the number of steam in comparison with
sailing vessels was insignificant, and the Transatlantic service between this country
and America was only in contemplation.

     Some difficulty was encomitered in the construction of these works, as they had
to be carried out without impeding the traffic in the harbour. They were com-

pleted in December 1851, so far as the dock was concerned. An additional half-tide

basin and lock, at the upper end of the dock, was commenced in 1856, and completed

in 1861.

    An immediate effect was felt in the increased tonnage of the shipping, and in the

superior description and size of the vessels frequenting the port.
     In the year 1853, Mr. Armstrong (now Sir William Armstrong) was consulted,

and in 1856 hydraulic power was first applied to work the existing hand gearing of
the lock by a system of shafting, which has since been superseded by more perfect
adaptation of the power, but the machinery, nevertheless, has worked without failure

up to the present time.

     As far back as the year 1846, attention was directed to the foreshore of the sea,
westward of the harbour entrance, as a site for floating dock accommodation, and
His Grace the late Duke of Beaufort consulted Mr. Brunei on the subject, and in

his report of October 1846, whilst strongly condemning a project again revived for
convei-ting the river into a float, he strongly recommended the construction of a

dock on the foreshore, on the site of the present South Dock. An Act was obtained

in 1847 for its construction, and in 1850 the works were commenced. These docks
are constructed in great part seaward of the original high-water mark, and the
geological features of the strata, exposed in the excavation, were somewhat of an
extraordinary character, consisting :

      1. Of made ground, ranging in depth from 20 to 26 feet, composed of gravel and
boulder stones, which must have been transported from a considerable distance, by
the action of river floods, probably from the neighbourhood of Llandore.

       2. Peat, vidth leaves, trees, &c., 2 feet.

      3. Blue or marine clay, 8 feet 6 inches, containing shells imbedded in it,

 ' Scrobicularia piperata,' stated to be still living on the coast.

      4. Peat, 2 feet 10 inches.

      5. Blue marine clay, 4 feet 1 inch.

      6. Peat with trees, 3 feet 1 inch, overljing the gravel foundation upon which
 the works are founded.

     At two points the foimdations had to be taken to an extraordinary depth in

 the lower peat, arising from the depression of the gravel at those points, apparently
 ancient river beds, and in the peat were found various trees supposed to be the
 remains of an ancient forest. Antlers of the red deer were also found in this

 stratum.

      The existence of this upper bed of marine clay beneath the made ground indi-
 cated that a dock might be constructed on the site with great facility -without
 danger of percolation from the tidal waters, and the result proved the accuracy of
 this conclusion. The works were commenced in 1854 and completed in 1859.
 They consist of a trumpet-mouth entrance basin leading to a half-tide basin en-
 trance 70 feet in width, ^^^th a depth of water over the cill of 24 feet at
 H.W.O.S.T., a half-tide basin or outer dock of 4 acres area leading to an entrance
 lock 300 feet in length and 60 feet in ^xddth, with a depth over the inner cill of
 22 feet 6 inches, the dock level being kept level vnih the tide of the day bv pump-
 ing from the half-tide basin in order to prevent accretion in the dock by the
 admission of the tidal water heavily charged with detritus.

      In 1860 the Great Western Railway Company completed their line into Swan-

 sea, together with certain provisions for shipping coal by hydraulic machinery in the
 North Dock, and in 1863 a railway was completed from Neath to Swansea, by which
 the great Welsh coal-field was brought into immediate commiuiication with the
 port, and it became a matter of great importance that this coal shoidd be conveyed
 to the South Docks for shipment. This involved the construction of two massive

 opening bridges for a double line of broad gauge railway, one across the New Cut

                                                    YY2

 or river Tawe, with an opening portion of 60 feet span ; and another across the lock
 of the North Dock of 72 feet span, both of which were executed by the firm of Sir
 William Armstrong and Co., and are worked by hydraulic power.

       In connection with these works extensive viaducts had to be constructed through
 the town and along the quay of the South Dock, for the shipment of coal from the

 high level by hydraulic drops, also constructed by Sir W. Armstrong and Co.

 These works were all completed aboiit the year 18G3, and the immediate result was
 an increase in the tonnnge of the port fi'om the year 1851, the period of the com-
 pletion of the first or North Dock, from 269,554 tons to 847,823 tons during the

  past year.

      During south-westerly gales it was found that the Western Pier, from its ter-
 mination being slightly within or landward of that of the Eastern Pier, afforded inade-
 quate protection from those gales, and in consequence a considerable inrun of the sea
 existed within the Harbour, and the sand also driven coastward during south-
 westerly winds occasionally blocked up the entrance. In order to remedy these
 defects, and to form a defined channel o^er the foreshore to low-water mark, an
 extension of the Western Pier was decided upon and completed for a length of
 1000 feet in 1863, the result being that the inrim of the sea no longer existed, and
 the entrance channel formed by dredging jxtri passu with the extension of the
 pier maintained its depth by the prolonged defined direction of the ebbing tidal

 current.

      Subsequently, hi 1875, it was determined to further prolong the pier an additional
 1000 feet, which was completed in 1877, the efiect being a stiU further increase in
 the depth of the chaimel, which has been maintained ; so that, at present, instead
 of 20 feet at spring tides, which existed in 1849, tliere is now an available depth of
 about 28 feet, which is conserved by the prolonged and defined action of the out-
 going tidal current, aided, to a certain extent, by the river floods.

       In consequence of the great increase in the size and numljer of the shipping
 frequenting the port, particularly steam vessels, it has been found indispensable to
 provide an entrance lock of greater size and depth of water over the cill, with an
 additional extensive dock and spacious quays so as to furnish ample siding accom-
 modation for the shipment of coal and increased facilities generally for the rapid
 and economical loading and discharging of cargoes. In consequence, the Trustees

 have entered into a contract for the construction of a dock in Fabian's Bay of 235-
 acres area of water space, together with an entrance lock 450 feet in length, and 60
 feet in width, with 32 feet of water over the outer cill at H.W.O.S.T. ; the dock
 to be kept (as in the case of the South Dock) above the tide of the day by the surplus

 water from Port Tennant Canal and other sources discharging into it.

     As regards the shipment of coal it is propo.«ed to be conducted on the same
 .system as that at the Alexandra Dock at Newport, ^-iz. by gravitation from the
 sidings to the hoists both for the loaded and empty waggons, the whole machinery
 of the dock appliances to be worked by hydraulic power, it havmg been found
 possible by this system at a very moderate cost to ship from 150 to 200 tons of coal

 per hour at each hoist.
      In addition to proAnding this extensi^·e dock accommodation the embanking of

the indent termed ' Fabian's Baj^ ' within the Eastern Pier vnW, it is anticipated, as
in other well-known cases, tend to accelerate the tidal flow into the upper reaches
of the ri^er, and gi^·e a better direction and greater force to the ebbing tidal current
for the future maintenance of the entrance channel at present in progress of being
further deepened by dredging.

     These various works are now in course of construction, and in conclusion I have
to state that it will afibrd me pleasure to conduct you over them and to explain in

detail their features, and those of the works executed during past yeai-s.

      1. On the Bute Docks, Cardiff. By J. McConnochie, M.Inst.C.E.

     The construction of the Bute Docks at Cardifi", and the consequent rapid
gi'owth of the town, are due to the remarkable foresight and public spirit of the late
                                                                            ;

Marquess of Bute, who, in the year 1830, finding the great mineral wealth of the

adjoining district of South Wales locked up hy the want of railway conveyance to

the sea-coast, and proper means of shipment, resolved upon the construction of a

dock on the foreshore at Cardiff, the only accommodation then existmg for vessels

being the Glamorganshire Canal, with a limited capacity available only for vessels

up to 200 tons.

The original design of the engineer, Mi*. Green of Exeter, was to place the

entrance gates on the foreshore at a point near the end of the present low-water

pier, and to construct a ship canal across the foreshore to the intended dock

on the mainland. The expense and difficulty of constructing such a work at that

time led to a modilication, and it was ultimateh' decided, mider the advice of the

late Sir William Cubitt, to cut an open tidal channel across the foreshore to the

mainland, and then construct an entrance basin communicating with the dock by

means of a lock.

This dock, now called the 'Bute West Dock,' was, vAth its sea approach, com-

pleted in 1839, at a cost of about 400,000/., an expenditure which even then

displayed the public spirit of the late Marquess of Bute, when the total import

and export trade amounted to less than 7000 tons per amiiun, as compared with

5,000,000 tons per annum at the present time, showing an increase of over 700 times.

The tidal water of this part of the Bristol Chamiel contains a very large quan-

tity of mud in suspension, which would have mvolved a heavj' expenditiu'e for

dredging the deposit if the tidal water had l^eeu impounded in the dock. This

consideration led the engineer to tLx the level of the dock water at several feet

above the high-water level of the Ohaimel, and to supply the dock with fresh

water from the river Taff. The water is drawn from the river for tliis piu'pose

about two miles inland, and the feeder passes through the town, and delivers the

fresh water at the north end of the dock. The entrance channel across the fore-

shore is three-quarters of a mile long and about 200 feet wide. The basin is 300

feet long and 200 feet -wide, with an entrance of 47 feet wide from the sea ; the

loclv between the basin and the dock is 152 feet long and 36 feet wide. The dock

is 4000 feet long and 200 feet wide, with 19 feet depth of water for a length of

about 1500 feet, and 15 feet for the remaining length of about 2500 feet.

The depth of water on the sill of the entrance gates is 28 ft. 9 in. at high water of

ordinary spring tides, and the gates are opened only for one hour before, and about

two hours after high water. The gates are constructed of timber. The water area

of the dock and basin amounts to 20 acres.

So gi-eat and rapid was the increase of traffic after the opening of the Bute

West Dock, that in 1851 it was decided by the trustees of the Marquess of Bute

to construct a new dock of larger capacity, now called the ' Bute East Dock.' This

dock has a sea-basin 380 feet long by 250 feet wide, approached from the entrance

channel on the foreshore by a lock 220 feet long by 65 feet wide, having a depth of

31 feet 9 inches on the siU, or 3 feet more than in the West Dock. The inner lock

from the sea basin to the dock is 200 feet long by 50 feet wide. The dock is

4300 feet long by 300 feet wide for the first 1000 feet, and 50U feet wide for the

remainmg 3300 feet. The uniform depth of water is 25 feet, the water-level in

this dock being maintained at the same level as in the West Dock, by water drawn

from the river Tafi". The water area of the East Dock and basin amounts to 45

acres. The lock gates were originally constructed of German and Enghsh oak

but having ultimately proved too weak to resist the great pressure of water to

which they were subjected, the gates of the outer lock were replaced in 1863 by

new gates, constructed of wrought-iron ribs, English oak heel and meeting posts,

and Dantzic fir planking. The gates of the inner lock were replaced in 1878 by

new gates constructed of wrought-iron ribs, heel and meeting posts with green-

heart facings, and Dant/.ic fir planking on both sides of the lower gates ; the upper

gates were faced on the dock side with wrought-iron plates, and Dantzic fii' plankmg

on the lock side ; both upper and lower gates bemg on the buoyant principle, this

construction being rendered necessary by the limited space provided in the masonry

Afor Avooden gates, and has proved perfectly satisfactory.  junction canal connects

the East and West Docks with the Glamorganshu-e Canal.

The basin and first portion of the East Dock were opened for traffic in 1855, and

the remaining length of the doclv was completed in 1859. The East Dock was

commenced from the designs of Su* John Rennie and Mr. John Plews, and com-

pleted from the designs of Messrs.Walker, Biirges, and Cooper.

  --Neto Basin. Notwithstanding this large accession to the dock area of the port,

the continued increase of traffic called for further accommodation ; and in 1864

application was made to Parliament by the Bute Trustees for powers to construct

additional dock accommodation ; but it was not until 1866 that an Act was ob-

tained for the construction of an additional basin, which has been completed from

the author's designs, and was opened for traffic in 1874. This basin is intended as

a preliminary to au additional dock of 54 acres area, for which Parliamentary

powers have been obtained ; and while serving the new dock, it also relieves and

facilitates the working of the traffic of the Bute East Dock.

    The New Basin is 1000 feet long by 525 feet wide, having a water area of 12

acres. It is entered from the channel on the foreshore, which has been widened

for this purpose by a sea-lock 350 feet long and 80 feet wide, having 35 feet 9 inches

Adepth of water on the sill.                                  junction lock 370 feet long, with gates 60 feet wide,

connects this basin with the East Dock. The chamber of the lock is 120 feet wide,.

so as to pass three or four vessels at the same time.

The existing dock accommodation provided by the Marquess of Bute and his

Trustees now amounts to 77 acres, and the Parliamentary powers recently obtained

will enable the Trustees still further to increase this accommodation by 54 acres

to meet the growing requirements of the port.

    The gates of the Sea Lock of the New Basin are 80 feet wide, and are believed to

be the largest gates hitherto constructed. They are of wrought iron, on the buoyant

principle, with skin plates, diaphragms, and lattice ribs, and with greenheart heel

posts, meeting posts, and sills. Each leaf of these gates weighs 145 tons. They

were constructed by Sir William Armstrong & Co., the arrangement of lattice ribs

being adopted at the suggestion of Sir William Armstrong, as affording more con-

Tenient access to the interior for examination and repair, and also diminishing the

weight in comparison with solid plate ribs.

    The gates of the Jimction Lock between the New Basin and the East Dock are

60 feet wide, and are of wrought iron, similar in design to the gates of the Sea

Lock, but with solid plate ribs in place of lattice ribs. They were constructed by

Messrs. Maudsley Brothers, of the Bute Iron Works, Cardiff. The lock gates,

capstans, bridges, and sluices connected with the New Basin are worked by hydraulic

machinery                                                     those at the East and West Docks  were arranged  for hand power, and

are still so worked.

     The provisions for the examination and repair of vessels entering the port con-

--sist of four graving docks one 200 feet long, entered from the West Dock ; one

400 feet long, entered from the East Dock, both the property of Messrs. C. Hill

& Sons, on ground leased to them by the Bute Trustees. The third graving dock,.

320 feet long, is outside the entrance of the docks, and is the property of Messrs.

Gunn & Co. The fourth graving dock, 600 feet long, with an entrance 60 feet
wide, has been constructed by the Bute Trustees, and is entered from the New

Basin. It is available for use by the public on payment of dockage rates, as at

ALiverpool.                                                   gridu-on, 350 feet long, has also been constructed by the Bute

Trustees on the east side of the channel outside the entrance of the docks.

   A low-water pier, 1400 feet long and 34 feet wide, was constructed in 1868.

The pier-head is provided with a floating pontoon or landing-stage, and the mini-

mum Adepth of water is 6 feet at low-water spring tides.                                                       railway is laid along

the pier, and also a carriage-way, and a vertical lift and 10-ton hydraulic crane are

fixed at the pier-head, together with suitable waiting rooms and conveniences.

Prior to the construction of this pier all communication with vessels in the roads

was cut off for a considerable time at each low water, which caused much incon-

venience.

The principal portion of the trade carried on in the Bute Docks is the export of

coal and iron, which amounted to four million tons in the year 1879. The import

of iron ore, timber, and general merchandise amounted in the same year to on&

                            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                       695

million tons. The consequence of the preponderance of exports is that ships arrive
at the port mostly in ballast, and special provision is required to he made for the
discharge of this ballast. There are four steam and two hydraulic cranes for this
purpose, each capable of discharging- 60 tons per hour. These cranes discharge the
ballast into railway waggons, which are conveyed a distance of about two miles to

land where the ballast is deposited.
     To provide for the safe removal of the vessels from the ballast quay to the

loading berth, after the discharge of the ballast, wooden booms, weighing from 5
to 20 tons each, are now fixed, one on each side of the ship, to keep it steady. The
growing use of water ballast for steamers engaged in the coal trade at the present day
has greatly expedited the preparation of vessels for receiving their outward cargoes.

     The coal traffic of the West Dock is supplied exclusively by the Taft' Vale
Railway from Merthyr, Dowlais, and the Aberdare and Rhondda A^alleys. The
traffic to the East Dock is supplied jointly by the Taff Vale, Rhymney, and Great

Western Railways, the last of which is the means of communication with the great

coal-field now being opened hi the centre of Glamorganshire, in the Ogmore dis-
trict. The London and North-Western and Midland Railways have also access to

the docks by their connection with the above railways.

   A very large extent of siding accommodation is required for working the coal

shipping trade ; for, owing to the fluctuations of the trade, loaded waggons have to
be stored in the sidings at times when the supply exceeds the demand. The extent
ef sidings provided and maintained by the Bute Trustees in connection with the

docks amounts to fifty miles in length (of single line), the whole of which is at

times fully occupied.

   --Coal Tips. The number of tips for loading coal at the Bute Docks is as follows,

viz. :

            13 balance tips at the West Dock.

            14 ,,  ,,       ,, East Dock.
                            ,, East Dock and Entrance Basin.
            6 hydraulic ,,  ,, Entrance Channel for loading in the tideway.
                            ,, Roath Basin.
            1,,    ,,

            8,,    ,,

        42 total number of tips.

--Anti-breakage Cranes. As the South Wales coal is of a very brittle character,

it is found necessaiy to take special precautions for reducing the loss by breakage

that occurs in discharging the coal waggons into the ship's hold, and for this purpose

Aanti-breakage cranes are applied to each coal tip with great success.       square

iron bucket, holding one ton of coal, and made hopper-shaped, with a hinged

flap for discharging at the bottom, is suspended from an independent light 'jib'

crane, fixed at one side of the tip frame, and having, in the hydraulic tips, hydraulic

lifting and turning motions. In commencing the loading of a ship, this bucket is

filled from the shoot, and then lowered to the bottom of the hold and emptied, the

process being repeated until a conical heap of coal is formed high enough to reach

nearly to the hatchAvay ; the shoot is then allowed to discharge freel}', and delivers

close down upon the heap, so as to prevent any breakage of the coal by the vertical

drop. These cranes are also used with advantage for discharging ballast or ordinary

merchandise, and for fiUing into waggons the small coal that passes through the

screens in the shoots on to the ship's deck.

Notwithstanding all these precautions, the proportion of slack that is found in

the coal when the ships are discharged at the end of the voyage is generally too

large to be satisfactory, and the author considers that this is due to the want of

care in trimming the coal in the ship's hold, in which process great breakage of

coal is caused by the carelessness of the men. This has been practically tested at

the Bute Docks, by loading a vessel with coal by means of wheelbarrows filled

direct from the waggon and lowered into the hold, and then wheeled at once to the

far end of the hold, so as to avoid any subsequent trimming ; the result was that,

though some extra cost of loading was incurred, the coal was delivered in such

exceptionally good condition that the extra cost was much more than cohered by

the reduction in the loss from slack.

                    2. On the Temperature of Town Water-supplies.
          By Baldwin Latham, G.E., M.Inst.G.E., F.G.S., F.M.S., §-c.

      In this paper tlie author pointed out that summer diarrhoea and cholera
 became prevalent when the water-supply of a district arrived at a temperatiure
 exceeding 62° Fahrenheit, and he showed that it Avas the changes which took place
 in water when at a higli temperature that induced the diseases referred to, and
 not atmospheric changes ; in corroboration of which he referred to districts in which
 the water was invariably cold in summer, and which consequently were not subject to
epidemics of diarrhcea. Moreover, ia districts in which the supply, when distributed
 through water mains, was from a well which was naturally cold at its source, as,
 for example, in the district supplied by the Kent Waterworks Co., when compared
with the districts in London supplied from the river Thames, it was foimd that in
the Kent district, the source of supply being so much colder at its source than the
Thames supply in summer, the ground requned a higher degree of temperature to
raise the temperature of the Kent water to a dangerous point, and thus the inci-
dence of the disease in the districts supplied with Kent water fell later than in those
supplied with Thames water. If the cause of the disease were due to atmospheric
temperature, the incidence should have been identical in both districts. The author
further pointed out that great changes in the temperature of water were due to the
temperature of the ground at the depths at which the mains were laid ; that the
temperature of the ground might be made use of in a special apparatus patented by
Professor J. T. AVay and himself, by which water was made to descend to a depth
of about 25 feet, by means of a vertical tube driven or screwed into the groimd, so
that the temperature of water required for dietetic purposes was rendered nearly

Auniform throughout the year.. greater range than 5° would not practically occur

in such a tube ; whereas in C!roydon, where there was a constant water-supply,
and where the water was of nearly imiform temperature in the wells before
passing into the mains, the range in tlie temperature had been 27-6'', and a cistern

supply of the same water gave a range of 38-7°. By keeping the temperature of

the water between the limits of 49° and 5i°, by the "use of the apparatus referred
to, it was explamed by the author that summer diarrhoea could, in a great measure,
be prevented.'

      4. On the Expansion of Steam in Non-Rotative Pimiping Engines.
                        By Henry Davey, M.List.C.E., F.G.8.

                                                         (Plates XII., XIII.)

      The Cornish Engine (Plate XII., fig. 1) has a piston, A, attached to one end of a

xuas^ve heam, the outer end of which is attached to the plunger of the pump. On the
ylunger is placed a heavy weight, w. When the piston is at the top of its stroke

steam is admitted on the upper surface of the piston of sufficient tension to impart
to it a high initial \elocity. The shaded diagram a' represents a steam diagram,
and the point b the point at which the pressure corresponds with the average pres-
sure. The area a, b, c, d, represents the work accumulated in the moving mass w,
whilst the piston is moving through the space a, b, and which is given out again
whilst it is still moving through the distance b, c. The energy of the mass at the

                                                                                           WV"

--time of its maximum velocity is expressed in foot-poimds by -^ · Putting E for

the resistance of the pump, or, as it is usually termed, the * water load,' and making

K = w, and F = the numtjer of foot-lbs. represented by the area a, b, c, d, we have

F = ---- and V = a/         -- --. In the example an eightfold expansion v = 14-1

feet per second, a velocity far too great for safe working.

      The Compomul Differential E7igine (Plate XII., fig. 2) is an engine in which

expansion can be carried to a greater extent with increased safety. The steam is

first expanded to a moderate extent in the cylinder a, and then further expanded

on the return stroke in the cylinder b. The engine is double-acting, and has double

w wthe power of the Cornish engine. The weights     bear the same relation to the

wwater columns as does in the Cornish engine, but as there are in this case two

weights the mass is equal to twice the water-load.

                     r'  =  2wvlandv=.\'/64^-4

                            64-4 V 2w

Assuming, as in the former examples, an eightfold expansion, produced by cutting

ofi" the steam at half-stroke in the first cylinder, and expanding that steam into the

second cylinder of four times the capacity of the first, the value of F = 58 and

V  =  a/^=6-8.

      V 2av                                                  ,

   The value of v would then be :

                    For the Cornish Engine v = 144 feet per second.

                    For the Compound Engine v = 6-8 ,, ,,
   In practice the comparison is still more favourable to the Compound Engine

Iwcause of the * gap ' in the diagrams.

   The author has constructed a velocity indicator, by means of which he has been

enabled to take diagrams showing at a glance the velocities in difierent parts of the

stroke. The diagrams (Plate XIII., fig. 2 and 3) were taken by this instrument.
From those, and from steam indicator diagrams taken in connection with them, he

has been enabled to form the comparison shown in the following table :
                                                                     --. a

698 EEPORT-- 1880.

In the diagrams (Plate XIII., figs. 2 and 3) the ahscissse of the curves represent

the spaces passed over hy the piston, and the corresponding ordinates the times in

"which those spaces were described.

   --The Differential Engine received its name because of its peculiar valve-gear

gear which aiitomatically effects the distribution of steam by the differential motion

produced in combining the motion of the engine-piston with that of a uniformly

moving subsidiary piston.

     In Plate XII., fig. 3, d is the differential lever, and c the connection to the en^ne

valves. The point r is attached to the subsidiary piston e. The motions of the
points E and c are opposite in direction, and when the motions are equal, there is no

--motion of the point d. When the motion of e is quicker than that of c, the calves

are being opened this occurs at the beginning of the sti-oke ; but as soon as the

engine motion c becomes quicker than that of the subsidiary piston e, the valves

are being closed. The initial velocity of the engine-piston varies according to the

resistance it has to overcome, and the resistance therefore determines the distribu-

tion of the steam.

   wThe Differential Engine is double-acting, and the weights w, Plate XU. fig. 2,

support each other, and cannot move except when moved by the engine. Should

there be a vacant space in the pump at the commencement of the stroke, the engine
would have no resistance to encounter except its own inertia and fiiction, and would

move off veiy readily on the opening of the steam valve, so much so that its initial

motion would be greater than that of the subsidiary engine, and the steam vahe

would be closed again ; but immediately the plunger came in contact with the
water, the full 'load woidd be upon the engine, and a halt would be produced imtil

the subsidiary' engine had gained a lead sufiicient to have fully opened the steam

valve. Plate XIII., fig. 1, is a steam diagram taken under the conditions just
described. This element of safety is most important. Peferring to the Cornish

Engine, Plate XII,, fig. 1, the more the steam is expanded in the cylinder, the greater
the initial velocity of the plunger, and the more diificidt it is for the water to foUow

up the plunger closely, and the greater the xmsupported weight at the end of the

stroke. With an eightfold expansion, the plunger would have an initial velocitj' of 600

feet per minute, and at the end of the stroke the steam-pressure would only support

one-third of the weight w. Should there be a vacant space in the pump, the plunger

"would fall back with a great shock. This is one of the greatest sources of accident

in the Cornish Engine. All the early compound engines were single-acting, that is

to say, they were Compound Cornish Engines, and in addition to possessing defects

in principle and construction, were very cimibersome and costly for a given power.

Plate XII., fig. 4, illustrates Sims's engine, which was a development of Trevet-

hick's Pole Engine*

Xm.,Plate  figs. 4 and 5 give respectively the relatiAe strains and velocities in

the two engines.

    As a question of weight and first cost for a given power, the following is a

comparison of the three systems of engines described in the paper :

properly stiffened within. This tube is to be ballasted, so as to make it v>-e]gh. 1 j
ton to the foot-rim less than the water displaced, and is to be held down to ^\·ithill
35 feet of the lowest water level by two 3-in. chains passed over the tube, and
attached to caissons weighing 500 tons each, and sunk a sufficient distance each

side of the centre line to give the requisite angle to the four parts of the chain.

      These moorings will occur at every 250 feet along the tube, and will be at such
an angle and so rigid that the tide will not affect them.

     The passage of trains through the tube will relieve the chains of part of tht+
strain on them.

      Ventilating shafts to be provided if found necessary, to act as block-signal
stations, and to be protected by light-ships moored on either side.

     The shore ends of the tube are to be laid in channels dredged and excavated to
receive them, and aftei-wards filled with concrete.

     The ends are to be laid in these channels on the hottest day that can be con-
veniently chosen, and angle-iron rings projecting from the tube, and held firm by
the concrete, will prevent any movement from the expansion or contraction of the

tube.

     The tube to be commenced in the centre, and to be gradually submerged and
anchored as the work proceeds. The two ends during construction -will rest ou
pontoons, whereon the work of adding to the tube wiU be carried on above water,
the tube being flexible enough to allow of this being done.

     The time required for constructing the tube is estimated at three years, and the
cost at eight millions sterling. The working expenses would probably not exceed
20 per cent, of the gross receipts. Twenty-seven trains a day in each direction, at
1/. a train mile, would yield 5 per cent. ; and three times this number of trains-
could be worked through the tube in the twenty-four hoiu's.
